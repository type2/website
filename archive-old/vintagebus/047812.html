 I don't think I've ever seen one leak.  I've seen leaks around where
 they screw in, from someone having re-used the crush washer, but
 that's user error.  (For the pedantic, I'm referring to the flat soft-
 metal washer like on the drain plate studs, not rounded like the drain
 plug washer; it's still a crush washer due to soft metal and
 using the deformation to form a seal).

I recently had a leak but it wasn't the unit itself.  There was a small crack 
in the back of the block at the casting line.  Teflon tape didn't help, so I 
cleaned the tiny, difficult to see crack up with acetone, put some metal 
epoxy on the outside, let it harden, then r4eplaced the unit and the leak 
stopped.  I will put in a metal insert the next time I pull the engine.  Make 
sure the leak really is in the sender.
