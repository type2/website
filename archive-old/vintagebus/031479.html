Subject: Re: [VB] What Gives?

&lt;&lt;one of the projects I have been working on is replacing the passnger
side
panel from the corner seam to just behind the reinforcement  in front of
the
vents, down to including the wheel well. &gt;&gt;

What a coincidence. Yesterday I began the painstaking process of pulling
such a panel out of a donor bus. Mine, too had been crunched, and while
it is not too bad, the vent got twisted amd I knew I would never be able
to get it back straight. Also, the wheel well is a pretty ugly sight. So
I took this sawzall to the donor bus, but what a pain. Didn't get it
completely out. Still have to cut the inner wheelwells and such. But my
big problem is the gas tank filler neck.  Can I Cold chisel around this
thing? I don't know if there is gas in there. Should I fill it with
water? I would like to try and salvage the tank and as many other sheet
metal and other parts as possible. Otherwise, i might just cut through
the filler neck. But I suppose I should still fill the tank with water
to keep from going boom. Haha, If only I could get the gas cap off!

You should have seen this bus. All covered in ivy and surrounded by
trees. Way past restoration. Looked almost as bad as Thoms 23 window :)
