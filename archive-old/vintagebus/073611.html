&quot;I also remember reading about a person or company that rebuilt clocks to 12
volt specs.&quot;

I had to rebuild a 6V clock for use in my 67 and all it needed was a resistor to
be placed across the coil inside the clock body, I don't have the specs on the
resistor, I just unsoldered and resoldered the old one out of my old clock that
was broke.

&quot; Also where can I get a restored steering wheel or send mine to be restored.&quot;

There is a company that sells new steering wheels on Ebay (user name
&quot;pimpride&quot;)  I going to buy one soon enough, there are 180.00 for ivory and
190.00 for black.

these are some links to some auctions they had recently.  I called and their
reserve is set to about 5.00-10.00 dollars beneath the buy it now price.
    Hope this helps,
