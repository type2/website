Subject: N O S parts

not my sh#t, not our parts, not old stock, not old stuff, no old stuff, new
old sh#t, new old stock, now overly spendy, not overly spendy, new Orient
stuff, not Orient sh#t, and the list goes on. Everybody out there doesn't
know the true meaning of N O S, so when buying something that someone has
stated as being NOS ask that person what there definition is of the three
letters used. I have purchased &quot;not old sh#t&quot;  before under the presumption
that it was NOS (new old stock), but I feel it was my fault for not asking
the seller there definition of there usage of NOS. It's always the buyers
responsibility to verify what they are purchasing and if they have any
doubts, don't buy it. It's they're own fault for proceeding with the
purchase.

Ronnie  old volks of az  (very little NOS (new old stock) stuff left)
