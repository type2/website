Hi Ronnie and Jon,
Nope!  Just because we think it is the most commonly found original EMPI part 
at the swaps does not mean we think it is the most commonly found VW part in 
the world.  For one thing with the EMPI logo on it big and bold on it, it is 
easy for even the novice VW owner to notice it.  Try finding say one of the 
original EMPI oil filter/pumps with EMPI logo on it (Wish we had a dozen more 
of those!) or the oil filter with the EMPI sticker on it or the 1964-65ish 
front bus anti-sway bar (We had one NOS unit.) or a type 3 EMPI seat or the 
EMPI bug gauge set.  All of these are much harder to find than the EMPI 
steps.     Eric&amp;Barb
