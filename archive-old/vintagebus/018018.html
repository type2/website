Clara (Claralw_at_aol_dot_com) pondered -------
&gt; audi (how do you make an audi symbol on this 
&gt; keyboard?)

I think the best way to make the Audi symbol is this:

CCCO

Hey, it's as close as \X/ is to the VW symbol, right?

Doesn't Audi use the same symbol as Auto Union?  By
the way, who were the members of that? VW, BMW,
Porsche and Audi?
