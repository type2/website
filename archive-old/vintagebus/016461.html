sorry for the requote:
&gt; this is why I picked up the motor 
&gt; conversion back to 6v.
&gt;  with my makita drill to the generator pulley bolt how many RPM 
&gt; would i need to check the generator for output.
&gt; with the excessive end play and dead cylinder on this thing, 
&gt; I can't justify  the $$$ to rebuild another motor
&gt; with a fresh 1600 sp in the kombi already
&gt; Now I know the 40 hp fan shroud, tin. etc won't fit my 1600 
&gt; *exactly* but has any one tired?

another idea
 would anyone like to swap cores to correct case #'s
my 62 for your 61?
then I might feel better about the rebuild of a 40 hp
rather than tacking the old tin on my new motor.
any takers on core swapping ?
anyone with experience with tin swap?

help appreciated!

aloha
Ken
