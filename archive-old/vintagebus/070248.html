Subject: Re: [VB] bus starter probs

Hi John,
Could be the solinoid, but if it is clicking it should be working.  Could 
also be the ignition switch is going bad (BTDT!), corroded/loose wiring 
(Check your electrical diagram for the routing.  BTDT!).  Bad connections in 
the fuse box (Solder the post-1960 clips and pre-1961 rivets together!  
BTDT!), bad battery cables (Especially if they have those replacement battery 
ends clamped to the cables.  Most likely problem we have found!).  Even could 
be the battery is going bad, not putting out enough voltage/amps to kick the 
stater over, or even something wrong with your generator/regulator/alternator 
are not putting out enough to charge the battery enough. 
   Best to first get out a volt/ohm meter that you can buy from most hardware 
stores for $15.00 or less.  We prefer the anolog (Old fashion needle readout 
instead of the newer digital.  Then check for voltage drops or ohm resistance 
(as Matt has mentioned to the list recently) throughout the system starting 
from the battery, then all the way forward and then back to the solinoid.  If 
perfect or nearly with 1/2 volt or less less drop or practicly no ohm 
resistance, check your regulator/generator/alternator for producing nearly 14 
volts to fully charge the battery.  for more info check the workshop manual 
for extensive info on voltage loss.
