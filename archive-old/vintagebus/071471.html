&gt; &gt;I have a 6v starter that I can't get to spin.

&gt; Can you spin the armature by hand?  If you can, turn it a little and
&gt; try putting the juice to it.  If it doesn't spin, take the juice
&gt; away and turn a little more and try it again.  

Don't put volts to any starter that is not self-supporting. 
You will short the armature, and it won't spin.
If you are quick, a split-second jump is all you can get
to verify the starter as a possible keeper.
But you are better off not knowing that :)
The starter ( armature ) must be supported at both ends
to turn correctly. Either the trans or an old bellhousing will do.
