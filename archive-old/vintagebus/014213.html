&gt; On another note, $1500 obo is possible, I've seen several $2-$3k Barndoor purchases in the past few years and I'm not even hooked in with the &quot;cool&quot; Bus people (as if) so I'm sure there's been a lot more.  None were Deluxes.
&gt; 

Nothing is ever cheep with the &quot;cool&quot; bus people - all the deals come
from the outside, where the hype and greed hasn't spread yet.  The &quot;cool&quot;
people find the $1500 deals, and then add zero and sell them to the 
Mortals.
