No, my id is everettb.  I must assume planetvw is someone evil.

Based on a tip from my neighbor, I went over to my local Dune Buggy place
today to see if they had any 36hp stuff in their piles of expelled heater
boxes and trannys and stuff.  As I was crawling under one of their trailers
seeing what was down there, I unearthed a 1959 36hp engine cleverly hidden
behind the piles of heater boxes and the dual axles of the trailer.  Turns
over, compression feels good, they said they tossed it under there a couple
years back when someone wanted a bigger engine.  I dragged it out and threw
it in my Bus, yey.
