Hey y'all.  I have the privilege of occasionally helping spin a wrench on a 
most pristine 1965 21 window.  The owner had been experiencing an exhaust 
leak where the heat exchangers meet the muffler.  thinking the doughnuts 
were gone, we removed the muffler and replaced the gaskets.  The leak was 
the same.

As I thought about it, I realized the outside diameter of the heat exchanger 
where it meets the muffler was about 6mm less outer diameter than the inside 
diameter of the doughnut.  The leak was temporarily stopped with, believe it 
or not, Duct tape.  Seems to be holding.

Question is, why the disparity in heater box diameter and doughnut sizes?  
The parts books all claim the same kit from about 1961 to 1972 (pancake 
engine).  Is there a different kit (doughnut) that should be used instead?

Dave
