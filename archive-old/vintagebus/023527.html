&lt;&lt; I would like to sell my 1967 Bus and don’t have a good idea how much to
 ask for it. If anyone can give me a rough idea what it’s worth from my
 description here, I’d be delighted, and offers are of course welcome.
 
 It’s a white 15-window (2 louvered, 2 popout) 12 volt model , in pretty
 good running condition, 220,000 miles on it. Key number is 30L009 for you
 sleuths. &gt;&gt;
67 15 window ehh?  as in a standard or kombi with 3 windows in each front 
door?
