&lt;&lt; When fitting the bushes that are like shuttle cocks, should I fit only the 
rear bush, insert the rod into the tube and slide it far enough forward to 
fit the front bush from the front, or should I fit both and squash the front 
bush by hand so that it goes into the shift rod tube?

whichever seems easiest to you.

 Is it okay to just grease the rod and the bushes and fit it, or should I put 
something else into the tube to prevent rust and keep shifting slick?
 
 Thanks &gt;&gt;

not a bad idea to push a rag through the tube to kinda clean it out.   But I 
definately grease the tube and bushings as I put them in, dunno how else to 
lube it.

I guess after cleaning the tube you could push an oily rag through the tube 
to oil it.
