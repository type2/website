I just traded away a complete BN4 with cables and ducting. I may be of some help. I have done a little trouble shooting on the BN4 in my Thing as well. As for your gas tank, you can remove your back seat and then the two or three large wing nuts that hold in the rear seat frame. The frame will now come out. You will see two panels. Behind those lies the gas tank. I have not had mine out but I have obtained a 15 gallon (I think, at least I know it is bigger than mine) gas tank from a bay window that looks like it should slide right in. I live in very Southern WA but am in Seattle on a regular basis. We should hook up at some point I would love to see the Double Cab. Mine is a '60. You may of seen it at Yakima. It is tan with the wood and bows but no canvas. 

Hope some of this helps,
