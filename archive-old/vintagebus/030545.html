Subject: Taking Frodo for a Drive

Today, for the first time since Thanksgivivng weekend I was able to get
the Westy out and take her for a drive. Ran over to Dick Bozarth's
Garage for a motor building seminar. Very basic stuff but a great chance
to get everyone togeather. We also checked out his 500 HP turbocharged
VW dragster. That would be one hell of a motor for my bus but it
wouldn't have much life expectancy.
It won't be long before I can take her out without fear of snow and
salt. Then come the camping season. Whoopee!!!!
