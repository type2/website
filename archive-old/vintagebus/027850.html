Amen brother Jim! While I appreciate the fact that this bus was apparently
cobbled together from a bunch of buses that would normally have seen the
crusher I still couldn't see it being worth more than a couple grand as a
novelty. I'm sure the work is fine, I'm not criticizing what I haven't seen
in person, but we all know that to get what you want out of a bus in this
price range (i.e. as an investment) you have to be either bone-stock, or
front cover material. Otherwise, you've thrown a lot of money into a hole.
It's might be a hole that's a labour of love, but if so, then why sell?
Sure, sometimes you have to scrape the money together, but as the saying
goes &quot;an emergency on your part doesn't constitute one on mine&quot;. I hate to
see people get into the position where they HAVE to sell a bus, but if you
think you're going to ever be there, you can't expect to get crazy prices
on something. The Campulance was a different beat altogether. I can't
believe it stayed in Jim's driveway long enough for the ink to dry on the
For Sale sign!

I sincerely wish the guy selling the bus good luck. But, if it were at a
show...I'd keep on walking by it personally.

But, what do I know...none of my buses are bone stock.
