&gt; A quick answer is:
&gt; It depends on how long you want the bus to last.
&gt;
&gt; The longer answer is:
&gt; Putting anything in there that CAN absorb
&gt; moisture WILL absorb moisture.  This WILL lead
&gt; to rusting from the inside out.  Check the
&gt; archives for potential answers to this dilema.
&gt; Simply putting something in there that won't
&gt; absorb isn't enough either.  The differential of
&gt; temperatures of insulated and uninsulated
&gt; areas WILL lead to inside condensation and to rust.
&gt;
&gt; It is not an easy problem to solve.  At least
&gt; in manner that won't cause problems later.
&gt;
&gt; The PO of my bus glued carpet foam type stuff
&gt; to the inside of the outer metal, in a haphazard
&gt; manner, leaving lots of place for condensation,
&gt; left off the plastic that protects the door
&gt; side of the interior panels from rain coming
&gt; though the door off the window.
&gt; I found it fully covered with mold.  This is
&gt; in sunny dry, hot California.  This was the
&gt; only panel I have removed to date.
&gt;
&gt; that's my take on it anyway.  Insulation
&gt; will keep it warmer, quieter, etc.  But
&gt; there's a drawback, it's what you are willing
&gt; to live with short &amp; long term that determine
&gt; your approach.

Has any one tried using a industrial vapor barrier applied directly to
the inside metal?
When I spent a summer doing masonry up north, we had a number of agents
that could be applied directly to the blocks below the frost line that
where designed to prevent water penetration, since the general consensus
is that if you put any sort of insulation in the bus you are going to
cause  area for rust to form it would seem to me that if you could pre
treat the area with a vapor barrier or some sort  so that the metal
would not be in direct contact with the  moister that the chances of
getting rust in these areas would be greatly reduced and yet would allow
the use of a variety of insulation that would provide the best results
for individual location. granted its probably a bit of over kill but in
the end it would probably help in general to keep the bus on the road
longer to have that sort of vapor barrier in place to protect form the
standard moister build up that occurs in such places to begin with, the
question is is there a product that will work in such areas that is not
going to be to expensive.

Just a thought, if any one has any experience with this please let me
know.
