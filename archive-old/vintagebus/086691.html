Subject: Re: [VB] i need color info

Earlier buses had the dash the lower color, in about 62 two tone buses had 
the dash the upper color.  The two tone bus with red dash has the inside of the 
cab doors, over head air vent, etc also red.  
From headlight bucket  and roof paint wear through analysis, I believe the 
entire bus was painted the lower color, then the upper color was painted on top 
of it.

&lt;&lt; I just bought a 1965 kombi standard a few weeks ago and I want to paint it 
semi-correctly inside and out.  I know this was originally all light grey, 
but i 
want to go with two tone outside - it was painted white over yellow by 
someone which is what it is right now.  I was wondering - on the two tone 
later 
busses, how do they make the transition from the two tone exterior to the 
interior?  If I paint the dash and all interior grey, what is the correct 
method to 
paint the door jambs and inside of doors?  Do you stop/start the color chabge 
behind the door seals?  Do you paint the dash the exterior lower color and 
all 
the rest grey?
