Subject: Foreign Aide&gt; GREAT people...

J.P. Henriksen is a long time friend and a truly nice guy. Bribe him with
Limes, Liquid and young girls and he will go to the ends of the Earth for you.
Half-kidding. Come ahead with the Limes, watch your daughter... (I do!) ;-P

Seriously, J.P., Barry, a drummer named Kerry and many others within the
Albuquerque VW community (and former Albq residents)are good friends. They
remain welcome at my house anytime.
Please tell me/us about your experience with JP and others. I continue to
recommend Foreign Aide and the &quot;Route66 Splits&quot; bus club as a habit.
Please stand by for the &quot;Buses and Balloons&quot; get-together if at all possible. I
am sure that you will meet new members of your family. =)
Best regards,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
