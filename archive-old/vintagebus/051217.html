Subject: Re: [VB] What exaust should I use?

I've decided to attempt to have custom exaust tips fashioned for my stock
bug muffler. Each tip will be ported off to each side. I think that a stock
bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my 1641cc. Two reasons: (1)
only one tailpipe as opposed to two, increasing back pressure (2) the stock
bus tip narrows at the end, causing even more back pressure. Anyone have any
thoughts on this idea?

&gt; just spend the 100 bucks and get a real complete bus exhaust from bus
&gt; depot. ive run all sorts and there is really nothing as good in a bus as
&gt; the real thing.
