Subject: Re: [VB] Spot weld cutter Help.

Hi,

I use a drill from Black and Decker called a Bullet. They have a pilot
drill point at the tip that keeps the drill from walking. I use a 3/16
dia. The tough part is to spot the center of the spot welds.
Good luck.
Chris

Subject: [VB] Spot weld cutter Help.


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Well I got back from Jerome and am all fired up to get back to work
on
&gt; my bus.  Bought a new Miller 130 welder, and am re-inspired to
finish up
&gt; this roof replacement.  I do however need a little advice on
spotweld
&gt; cutters.  The ones I've been using so far are from Nothern Tool and
&gt; Equipment.  They seem to work pretty good , but I have around 50 to
100
&gt; more spot welds to go.  I know some of you have done alot of this,
and
&gt; so I ask who makes a good strong one?  Anyone have any advice on
this
&gt; subject.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Aaron
&gt; '61 Westy with no roof (kind of scary looking) sitting on the drums
&gt; (thanks ronnie, great idea)
&gt; '59 23 with full of westy interior parts, next for resto, unless I
get
&gt; side tracked again
