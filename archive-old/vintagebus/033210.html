Hi everyone, this is a bug question, but it can be bus too because it covers
the same thing
I'm finishing up a restoration on a 56 hardtop bug
I'm using the original 36HP motor, but the car is converted to 12v.
A local shop has said that you can use the original 6 volt generator and
install a 12 volt regulator.
He says that the generator will put out 12 volts, obviously the amps are going
to be a lot lower, 
Does anyone know if this is correct and will work without buying a Porsche
generator or having the VW 6volt one rewound
If anyone has any info on this please let me know
Thanks
