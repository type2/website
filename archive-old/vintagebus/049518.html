&gt;Hello F&amp;KLM,
&gt;
&gt;Well I did it, after weeks of running on battery only, I screwed my
&gt;courage up, pulled my 12v regulator and yanked off the cover to have a
&gt;look see at those &quot;no  user serviceable parts&quot;.
 Anyone else done this?
&gt;
&gt;Aloha

For the record, I know several folks who have done this... a few got away
w/ it, but most burned up the generator (when the regulator was bad, as
opposed to a problem in the generator frying the reg).
IF you know how to test electronics, I think you could prolly repair these
by isolating what broke and why w/ test equipment (out-of-value
resistors/diodes, etc).
Be aware different regulators have used different parts, diodes, etc, and
they don't mix, so if scavenging make sure you use two similar regs.
I think the secret is WHAT  was fixed, and did you fix what made it break,
as well? In otherwords, trying to solder up the little spool of wire in
there isn't gonna work, but replacing a broken solder connection might. And
if the connection MELTED, you have to figure out what MADE it melt, and fix
that, or all you have done is allowed the problem to continue; if the
generaor is acting up, and that melted solder is the result, resoldering
will simply put a wonky generator back on line - and worse results, like a
fire in the engine bay, might result.

I wish it WAS possible to repair that little thin spool of wire; I have
several NOS 6v hi-amp bus regs that all have been damaged in storage, and
that little wire is broken :(
