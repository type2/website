&gt;&gt;After Thom's trip to look at that bus, I wondered if anyone had made
&gt;&gt;up a checklist to go thru when you are looking at a bus, 

&gt;&gt;Or more important having someone else look at a bus for you.

Last May I took a detailed look at a '60 double cab here in Houston for 
a fellow list member who lives in Austin, Texas, but didn't have time 
to drive down for a look-see.  This was a pretty thorough look --- I 
took tools, floor jack, etc. to the owner's house, and spent two or 
three hours poring over the bus, including a road test &amp; a compression 
test.

I wrote up an ASCII text report, which I emailed to the prospective 
buyer.  The report was pretty long, so I added a table of contents.

If someone wants to use that (TOC) as a starting point for a checklist,
I'd be glad to pmail it to them.  I guess I could expand it into a
checklist myself, but I can't promise how quickly I'd have time to do
that.

Where would such a checklist reside?

Cheers, Bill
