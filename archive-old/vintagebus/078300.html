Subject: Re: [VB] It's alive! And rear wheel seals are leaking...

Matt,

Did you get all the correct spacers and the round seal in place? Check
your Bentley manual. What year is it? Clara? where are you - can you help?
My memory of this assembly is bad, and my Bentley's 1500 miles east!

&gt; The bad news is that I finished my RGB assembly last weekend.  When I filled them up, oil started leaking through the overflow hole on the bottom as well as around the axle stubs.  Both sides are acting the same, so I must have missed something.  They are new seal kits, what did I do wrong?
