Hi Chuck &amp; Jan,
Well yes, and no.  The standard stock and stock accessory electric senders
have one wire coming from the gauge and should also have a ground wire
grounding the sender to the body of the bus.  The only positive wire goes to
the gauge and the other wire on the gauge goes to the sender.  Eric&amp;Barb
