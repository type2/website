Are the holidays adding unwanted pounds?  Want to get a head start on
getting in shape for spring?  Then you need to read this!

I have developed a brand new weight loss program, GUARANTEED to work!
Build muscle tone, lose unwanted inches, FAST!  No fad diets, no icky
special food, no complicated gizmos to buy!  Eat all you want and still
lose weight!

Here is what you do:  take a VW bus with questionable electrics, start it
up and drive away, making sure you drive *downhill*!  When the bus dies 200
yards from your house, simply push it home, uphill!  After about 5 times of
doing this, you'll feel the burn in your legs and arms - that's new muscle
developing and fat melting away!   Amazing!  

After a few weeks of this, you'll be a new person!  Either that or you'll
jet on down to the FLAPS and buy a new starter and bushing...
