If anyone is interested in repro deluxe vent trim, talk to this guy:
He's trying to find out how much of a market there would be if he
actually goes thru with production.

Hey Thom,
I'm the guy that made the repro tool boxes and am in process of re-poping the
aluminum trim for the 55-63 cooling vents. Do you think there is a market for
these?
I would have to make 5000 at first enuf for _at_275 busses retail would have to
be about 80-84 dollars a full set, what do you think?  If you have see our
website you know we have Chrome emblems for sale too both barn door and the
&quot;new&quot; to 67 kind. If you have not seen the site double click the highlited
