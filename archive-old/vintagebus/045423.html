 Interesting accessory.  From the look of it, I'm not sure it has the proper
 design to support someone's weight.  Of course, I've never been able to use
 those little front bumper steps to get into a Bus anyway, they seem too far
 forward.

funny you should say that.   I have a step on my65, and no one ever uses the 
this - it is on the passenger side-  It gets ignored when getting in the bus. 
  

I just put a side step on my 65 a few weeks ago - the one that goes in the 
jack points at the cargo doors,  and though I find it nice for getting in the 
bus (extra little step) but more importantly helps access the roof rack (now 
I see why one each side would be useful even with double doors one side)  but 
I dont like that way it makes the bus have reduced ground clearance and look 
like it squats.    Hmmm.   should it stay or should it go now (or as a guy I 
know says-  should I shave or should I grow now?)  Seem to be picking up and 
applying accessories to this beast, and I dont want it to end up looking like 
one of those Christmas tree bug.  Maybe If I paint the side step flat black 
it will be less noticable that the shiny metal look.
