  Anyhow, they were
&gt; changed- i think for the 66 
&gt; model year, definately the 67 has a differnt kind
&gt; than 65.

Really? I have a 67, does that mean I have yet ANOTHER
67-only part to hunt for?

I need the washer bottle, is 67 unique? How can I tell
if I come across one? And can the others be adapted,
if I dare.

thanks
