Subject: switched to dual carbs = lower mpg

I recently put a set of Solex 35mm dual carbs on my 1600 motor.  I like 
the results (more power, better power curve) but I seem to have lost 
mpg.  I was running 20-24 for my single 34-pict, now I am down to 16-19. 
Is this normal? &amp; how do I tune things for better mpg's? These carbs 
only appear to have an idle jet mixture screw.  I don't know what size 
main jets they come with but do I need to swap jets or something?

thanks
rob
