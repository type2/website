Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Real&quot; insurance

i have mine insured with State Farm. they were VERY accomodating, and since 
the wife and i have our 'dailys' insured with them too, the insurance is 
VERY cheap. i have no mileage restrictions and have my bus insured for 
$7000!!!

&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the FART, but I read the archives:
&gt;Can anyone recommend a company that will insure a 60 doublecab?  The truck 
&gt;is restored, will be logo'd, and put into service as a work/advertising 
&gt;vehicle that is driven EVERY DAY.  The typical classic car insurance will 
&gt;NOT work bc of mileage restrictions and bc it will be used for business.  I 
&gt;need &quot;REAL&quot; insurance here, but it seems companies just won't take this 
&gt;one.
&gt;Any help appreciated.  Surely some company can fill my basic need.
&gt;
