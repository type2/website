&lt;&lt; What they're asking me is the diameter/length of both the pin and the
bolt. ANYBODY? Also, has anyone else cross referrenced shocks from another
vehicle for a similar situation? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gary,
The upper bolt for the front hydralic shocks is 211 413 401  Bolt M 12 X 91 -
Shock absorber from chassi # 971 549.  Pretty darned sure that the lower
mount is the same diameter.  Have you tried NAPA?  They have just recently
reissued the short shocks that fit the the late split window beetle that
might work for what you are having to endure since there is no easy cure.
