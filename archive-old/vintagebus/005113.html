    As NQ and I settle back into Nebraska cold and wet I wanted to take the
time to thank the people that made it possible for me to go to the Busses by
the Bridge V.          First off to John Howard who took us under his wing
and made us feel like long lost kin.  We were able to use his DD bus as our
own and he really didn't know us (or me) from the Texas 7.
    To Ronnie of the Old Volks Home who was as kind and generous as anyone
could be.  He made me feel like I had been a long time friend.  And as Erin
is a big boy he let me sleep in his bus.  It was loaded with stuff but he
cleared a place for me but Thanks to Kyle's carpet walk I had enough Tequila
to down a elephant and slept like a baby.  Oh Thanks Kyle, Joe, DeDe, and
the rest of the ABC clan.  Guess I am going to have to get some local
moonshine made from Nebraska corn to get them all %#$_at_ed up.
    Thanks to Britt Grannis and his daughter Katlin for getting us to and
from Las Vegas.  I owe you big time.  Plan on a place to stay when you come
through here next time.  To all the listies that I met it was a thrill to
meet you all and I met so many I have forgotten half your names but I will
recognize it when you post.  Great to of met all the VTO guys and Everett
Barnes, and Charlie Hamill, and Jerry Jess and Paul and all the others.  I
was impressed with the VTO guys as they don't leave a broken bus behind
ever.  Nice to put a face to the posts.  Again Thanks to all for your
generosity and making me feel so welcome and wanted at your show.  See you
all soon (I hope)
Erin is a much better story teller than I so I will leave that to him.  If
any of you ever need a place to stop in Omaha let me know and I will be thee
for you.
Remember the Omaha VW show is July 21st so plan on it if you can.  Maybe we
will get more than the 7 busses that we had last year
The weekend was and still is a blur as it went way to fast but it is a
highlight in my life
Thanks to all and VW for giving us a car that we all LOVE
