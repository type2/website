Subject: re:testing old thermostat

Hi Mike,

I belive the thermostat should have the temperature range impinted in it.
Anything below the range should leave the thermostat smallest, and above
would be largest. As for the water test-I've had results just using the hot
water from my tap. The thermostat should be sealed-if it has any holes it
won't work/that is part of what this test checks. The gas inside expands as
it gets hot-causing the thermostat to expand.
