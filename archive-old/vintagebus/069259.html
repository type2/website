&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; That elongated stud to bolt the sump pickup tube from wobbling and
loosening
&gt; in its hole allowing air to be sucked into the oil pump instead of oil was
&gt; only added to the VW engine about 1970!  A darned good modification to do
for
&gt; any earlier engines when rebuilding!  As for repairing a stripped out sump
&gt; plate hole you are best to use the 6/8mm stud Ray has reffered to is the
way
&gt; to go.  Since this is going in a running engine and you probably can not
&gt; completely degrease the case area for lock-tight.  You can instead center
&gt; punch around the new stud to snug the hole to the replacement stud.

Nice side-step ( stud:) , E&amp;B !
The question remains:
How do you replace the oil pick-up mount / sump plate stud  ???
Has Ray got a 6/8/6 stud for that :) ?
My theory... If that particular stud is stripped externally,
and the pick-up side is firm, you must split the case
to repair it. Or seriously bend a wrench !
