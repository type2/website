Hi Folks,
Been reading the post about M-codes. NEATO had a super review in their Old Bus
Review
September/October issue. Starts on page 10 continues to page 14. They also
have it (or did anyway)
on line around december 1997. I tried to check that out and couldn't bring up
the site. They have moved
to a new one at
http://www.neatoclub_dot_org/
Hope this helps!
Mike Turner
