Timing is no issue. I've seen 18 month calendars out there. This could be
done!
Any idea how?

Andre


&gt; I love the calendar idea though you are right about timing.  December
could
&gt; certainly be one of the decked out buses with lights... tastefull yet full
&gt; of cheer kinda thing?  Other pics could be taylored to reflect the season
&gt; and activities associated with them.  A SC or DC loaded up with pumpkins
for
&gt; October?  Course there is the October Fest approach also.  I like alot and
&gt; would be happy to help in some way if any supposed talent could help.
