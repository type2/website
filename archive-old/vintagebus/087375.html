Subject: Interior painting.

I am getting ready to repaint my '63 Sundial. The only thing that will
be non-stock is the paint job. I am going to try to mimic a later
'65ish deluxe paint job.

My bus came from the factory as a walk-thru panel later to be
converted (hacked) into a sundial camper. Paint code is &quot;BLUE&quot; for L31
dove blue.

The interior behind the front seats was painted grey.... Since the
previous owners went to town  with spray cans, I can't tell where the
grey ends and the blue begins. The dash and seat pedestals were
definitely blue. The floor between the front seats was blue.... and
the cargo floor was grey.

what about the dividers behind the front seats? were those grey or
blue? Where is the paint line?

On the later two tone deluxes, what color was the interior painted and
where were the paint lines?

I am going to paint the top half of mine some VW white, as well as the
interior... I'd like to paint everything that was originally grey
white.... but I'm not sure what would be true to the original VW
scheme...

any info is appreciated.

thanks.
Eddie
