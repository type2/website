&gt; you should try a type 4 engine in your 911. the factory did it. (  912 ).

'76 912e - which was an excercise in inventory depletion for 914 motors.

&gt; or even better, try a beetle engine. they tried that too. ( another 912).

Same story, 356 engine.

Now the *real* 912 engine - the engine *labelled* 912, not the engine *in*
the 912, *that* would be da bomb - 12cylinder, MFI, ungodly HP (600+ as I 
recall)

Or, if you *really* have money to burn, you could slap a 4-cam carerra
engine
in your split bus...  I think a builable core would run you ~$10k-$15k.
Ronnie probably has a couple of these in the back of his shop...
