&gt; i just got a 1600 dual port for clyde and i was wonder
&gt; your opinions on these motors. does anyone have one of
&gt; these? it's brand new, not rebuilt. it has unleaded
&gt; heads, and it was made at the mexico plant. i will
&gt; have it set up with dual weber 34's, bosch 009,
&gt; lightened flywheel, and empi gt-style muffler. how
&gt; much hp do you suppose this will put out? i'm assuming
&gt; it will be significantly greater than my old 1300 with
&gt; bad compression and a wobbly crankshaft pulley...

I have two of them I bought from Ronnie at Old Volks.  After 2000 miles on
each they are working fine.  One has a slight oil weep (bottom of
engine is a bit moist, but never drips), the other is
completely dry.

I don't know if I would want to hot-rod these engines without opening them
up and going through them.  You'll probably want to run more compression
and swap the crank for a counterbalanced one.

All in all, I'm quite happy with them in the stock configuration.
