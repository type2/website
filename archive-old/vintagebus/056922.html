Subject: Re: [VB] Split Bus Club

I used to be in that club when I was in Napa.  I was working on a website
a year ago before I left, but it was a personal vendetta since I enjoy
making them, but I don't know if anyone tried to work on it after I left.
 The email address that was valid when I was a member was
splitbc_at_aol_dot_com, so maybe you can get in contact with Janet there.  Tell
them Adam and Verna said Hi.
