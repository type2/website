Greetings all...

I recently acquired &quot;Sidney&quot;, my '66 Van and am starting to learn of all
the quirks associated with this beastie...Anybody got any suggestions for
fair/reputable repair places in/around Greater Vancouver?  Also, any
suggestions as far as repair manuals go?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated :)  many thanks...

Bray
