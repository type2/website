Having just purchased a Westy (my first bus but not first ACVW) I don't know
much about what is currently available as far as tents.  However, I can say
that I would be interested in a repro if someone were to tackle that
project.  I saw my friend Danny at a show a while back and he had the tent
on his 62 set up.  That thing was great!  It was the only shade in the area
and I can see how that would be a wonderful addition on a camping trip.
Stock look is not important to me, just functionality.  The awning in RMMW
looks cool but I think I'd want the full set-up.
