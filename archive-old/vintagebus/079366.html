Hi Josh,
You can pick those up for $1.50 each at Wolfsburg West _at_:

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=111129921

You will need two more to hook up the heater cables anyway!
BTW be carefull not to turn the engine over too long in one try.  We keep it 
well below a minute and let the battery and starter cool for about a minute 
between tries.  Otherwise you can damage the battery or even the starter by 
overheating them.
When you say the brakes were &quot;fixed long ago&quot;, hopefully you mean in the last 
two or perhaps three years.  If more time than that, take the brake cylinders 
apart, polish them out with 300-400 grit wet/dry sandpaper and reassemble.  
This will remove any rust in the cylinders that has formed and rid the system 
of any water logged brake fluid.  Yes, standard brake fluid sucks in water over 
time even when just sitting in a parked VW!!!  Not only can this water in the 
brake fluid rust up the brake system, but can turn to steam when braking 
heavily and cause the brakes to fail like air in them.  Plus replace the flex 
brake lines if over five or six years installed!
  If you do not have it maintained to roll, steer or brake properly your VW 
will more likely become a uncontrolled missle on the road!
