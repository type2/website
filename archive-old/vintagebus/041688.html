&gt; Hi all
&gt; Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag
&gt; I have seen ,,, see me at the Yellow bus at 10..  etc,, but what if the
&gt; Yellow Bus is forced to stay in the parking lot and the Listee walks right
&gt; by you,,, you'd never know..
&gt; So ,, My question, is there a  &quot;Hi , My Name is  Mr Bus Driver &quot;   tag
&gt; available?  :-)

Well, it so happens that my father is in the business of making engraved
plastic badges.  In reasonable quantities, they can be had for about $5
each with name, club name, and even a simple logo, all engraved into the
2-color plastic of your choice.

They pin securely to your clothing, last just about forever, and don't
smear or get soggy when you get them wet.

The business and ham radio people love 'em, but the they don't seem to
have caught on with bus folk.

If there is interest, I'll look into it further.
