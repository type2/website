&gt; actually, that should be standard for a 63 model (or to be exact
&gt; from ch# 971 550- july 30 62).   I had found a 62 with a sliding
&gt; drivers seat- which is very unusual, and suspected that the 195
&gt; on the tag meant the sliding seat but now i am not so sure.

First, my 'help' to Jeff was to pass along clara's speculation
about 195 being the sliding seat.  clara and I have had several
offlist discussions on this.  Hence her &quot;not so sure&quot; at this
point.  I received some conflicting answers from owners of buses
with M-195.

The NEATO Old Bus Registry has seven (including Jeff's) buses
with M-195:

Chassis #   Prod. Date
  889.549   01/15/1962
  897.764   02/01/1962
  906.637   02/20/1962
  976.510   08/06/1962
1.027.740   11/12/1962
1.032.682   11/22/1962
1.037.414   11/30/1962

I reached several of the owners by telephone or email and most
confirmed &quot;adjustable&quot; seats, but there came some questions about
whether this was a sliding adjustment or a dual-position
adjustment.  My opinion is that Jeff's double cab leans the
arguement toward &quot;sliding&quot; driver seat, but that the verdict
is still out.

Anyone else out there with M-195 want to add to the data?
