Subject: : [VB]  Heated front windows

Split window bus heated front windows... Is it wet and foggy where you live
? do your dogs fog up the front windows?Is your window wiping rag always wet
? Do you hate putting on Rain ex anti fog ? Well I was reading Ultra VW from
the UK and there is a company  www.thebusstation.co_dot_uk that sells split
front windows with heating elements in them also rear 64-67 and front 68 -79
ones. I've not tried them but like  the idea.    Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
