Hi all!
I have a pair of 5 bolt VW drums that i would like to sell.
I wondered if any one can identify them by the part # 113.506.615.D
They are new.
Also I was wondering about the &quot;big nut tranny&quot; axle dimensions.
What is the size of the splined part? is it the same as a small nut 
axle? I measured my axle spline and it is 30 m.m. dia and about 76 m.m. 
long from the bearing to the threads.
TIA.

my ICQ# is 4652936
