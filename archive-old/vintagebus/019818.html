I had been working on redoing all the cabinets on the interior. I got a call
from Jim on the list, he was visiting houston, so I was going to meet him at a
VW club meeting, about 45 minutes from my house.

So i am cruising down the highway, get to the exit, pop the clutch in to
downshift, and I hear this agonizing groan/grinding noise, and the oil
pressure light pops on. I immediately turned the engine off, and hazards on
coasted into a parking lot down the road. I was about a mile from the
meeting.

I called jim, and he came back to meet me. couldn't tell what it was, the
engine was real hot(couldn't touch the dipstick. Looked and looked. There was
some oil on the rear passenger wheel. Looked the same as when my rear wheel
bearing seal went on the driver's side. Except when that happened I didn't get
that screaming noise. I tried restarting it after a while...something didn't
sound right, and it didn't want to start. I didn't push it too hard, I only
tried a couple times. 

so i got it towed to my friends garage. 

I began tearing the thing apart, until i couldn't find my 17mm wrench. So I
went home around 12:30. I went back yesterday, and found the 17mm wrench,
sitting on the back of the bus, along with every other wrench! 

Anyway I pulled the engine, took off all the engine tin, header, fan shroud
etc...then took the heads off. Nothing looked odd, although one of the valves
was black(the other 7 were kind of grey I think).

Then I started to move the flywheel, it seems to have a lot of free
play, so I am thinking that maybe the dowels in the flywheel sheared

I guess what I mean by the flywheel having free play was that it feels like i
can turn it about 1&quot; before the engine begins to turn, 

ie the flywheel should turn precisely with the pulley on the back of the
engine? well now when i turn the flywheel there is a certain lag before the
rear pulley begins to spin. 
 
...I don't have the tools to remove the flywheel. So on monday I will be
heading over to the &quot;best&quot; VW mechanic in houston, to see if he can pull the
flywheel for me, and then see whats up....

so if it is the dowels that sheared, any idea what causes that?

happy easter
and thanks
-kevin
