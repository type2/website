&gt; I recently got a little stash of parts from a friend of mine... included

&gt; of a short lived high performance engine that was in a type3.  I got the
&gt; heads, some tin, and the oil cooler.  I got the lower cylinder tin (aka
&gt; cool tin) and plan on giving this stuff a shot.
&gt; What would that oil cooler be from?  When/why/how was it used?

The oil cooler is the standard one from a t3 its the exact same size as a
doghouse cooler, some will argue that it cools better, but i have run one
and not really seen a difference.

Some things to watch out for:
If you run a t3 cooler upright AND put your oil pressure switch on the
cooler, its electrical lug will interfere with your rear motor flange... i
had to bend it to make it clear the front tin.

The thread on the cooler ISNT tapered, it takes a special oil pressure
switch at least on mine... it leaked like a sieve, so you might need a
copper crush washer on there, im not sure. At the very least use a dab of
loctite pipe thread sealant (white goop in a tube, blows that white tape
away by a large margin.  Great stuff)

You will have to cut up your doghouse shroud.  You will need a slot about
1 inch wide, 2 inches tall to clear the boss for the pressure
switch. (self explanatory when you try to put the shroud onto a t3 cooler
installed as upright. You'll see where the boss hits the sheetmetal.  get 
out the grinder.)

The pressure switch and Hoover bit are mutually exclusive, so you will
have to find some other way to seal around the bottom of the cooler where
the shroud ends.

So, with all that in mind, i'd say get a regular doghouse cooler. The
marginal cooling benefits that may come from using the t3 cooler are
offset (at least for me) by the additional fabrication and complexity
required by its use.

The ONLY way i'd ever use one again is if its all i had, or i was running
a t3 converted to upright where i hadnt drilled and tapped for an oil
pressure switch in the standard t1 location.

take care,

Steve
