It is welded on!  so you would need to cut one out of a junk bus and weld
that in.

But... you cant have the heat log AND a camper bed... since you have a 21
i doubt you will put a bed in, but if you might want one, i'd go ahead and
wait on that repair until you are sure that you wont want one...

take care,

Steve

p.s. my 61 has a cut heat log too
