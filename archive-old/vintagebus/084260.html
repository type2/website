Subject: Re: Front Seat adjustment...

Back in the 50's when those huge metal visors were stylish,
they made a plastic gizmo that sat on the dashboard. It had
slots in it to reflect the streetlights since the driver 
could not see up much at all when stopped at the light.

I think they are available as reproductions. I've seen a 
few at old car shows. Check with American car restoration
sources. One of those spot mirrors designed for side
mirror on the dash might serve the purpose, though not
as period as the plastic dohickies. I have no idea what
they are properly referred to.
