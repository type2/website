Subject: Engine knocking
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm about to visit the T2 library and list archives, but thought I'd go
ahead and send this.

I fired up my engine in the Kombi today (1600cc DP) and after it ran for a
minute it started knocking. It hasn't done this up to now. But it is there
now consistantly. I plan on checking the adjustment on my valves in the
morning on Sat. when I can get to it (I'm not driving the bus yet). I know
just saying &quot;knocking&quot; is kind of a general statement. It doesn't SEEM to
be a consistant tick-tick-tick-tick...although it did do that at one point.
It seems a little more spread out. Maybe even a kind of loose knocking,
like something bouncing around. Engine seems to be idling OK and running
fine otherwise. I didn't run it for a long time. But the engine was
definatly warmed up. The sound does seem internal. I looked around for a
loose screw or something bouncing around. I sure wished I would have found
something like that.

Hope this isn't too vague. Any advice or suggestions on steps and
procedures to take while going at this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
