&gt;Are you going to the &quot;50 years of the bus&quot; show in Auburn Hills, MI on May
&gt;19-20?

I didn't know that the show this year had that theme, very cool.  I'll be
there, it would be fun to have a type2 listee tent with coffee and donuts,
if nothing else.  Does anyone have a handle on who is organizing that event?
