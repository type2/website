Hi,

My 67 leaked like a screen door on a submarine from the back of the RGB's.
When I unbolted the boxes from the plates, I realized my problem.  The plugs
had either rusted through or had been pounded in too far and somehow damaged (I
suspect the former).  I made a puller out of a old screwdriver (check out NQ's
site I got the idea from him) and punched a hole in the plug and pried it out.
Some new plugs from WW (or BBoys) and some good sealant around the
edges...reinstalled and not a drop since.  Very nice not to leave markings
where ever you go too!

I think the sealant between the box and the plate is just a Band-Aid.  You'll
be pulling them apart soon I'd bet.  That being said, I've only done this once
as described above...your mileage may vary ;-)

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; Just stopped by the FLAPS (a week ago I didn't even know what that meant,
&gt; now it seems a part of my regular vocabulary) and picked up some of that so
&gt; called &quot;aircraft&quot; sealant for my rdx box to spring plate leak (as per
&gt; discussion last week). I'm planning on getting at it tomorrow. In the aisle,
&gt; right next to the sealants, was a variety of gasket materials - sheets and
&gt; rolls of gasket stuff of all different thicknesses, etc. I'm wondering -
&gt; should I get some and cut it to fit between the rdx box and spring plate?
&gt; Would it help any or would it make things worse? This is just a fixer to
&gt; keep the fluid in the tranny to give it a little longer life (it's been
&gt; without fluid - at least without the fluid that leaked from the reduction
&gt; boxes - for a couple of years, and still works fine, but I know eventually
&gt; I'll have to go for a new one).
&gt;
&gt; Would putting a gasket in there help? Or should I just clean the surfaces
&gt; and use the sealant? How about sealant and gasket?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, I'm going for it without the gaskets tomorrow morning...unless I
&gt; hear any support for gasket material.

&gt; BTW - for you San Diego folk, while I was at the store, I saw a flier for
&gt; the swap meet at Qualcom this Sunday. Anyone ever been to one? What's the VW
&gt; content like? Is it worth the drive down there, or will it just be a bunch
&gt; of old Chevy stuff?
