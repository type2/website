Subject: Re: [VB] Re: bus with ghia tranny hard to shift

yes, for some reason it is MUCH easier to change rear shift coupler on my 65 
than it was on my early 59 or the kind with the 66 1/3 to 67 style shifters.  

The 65 I didn't have to disconnect anything but the rear coupler.   

BDs are really easy, as there is a removable cover plate, so you can reach 
from inside the bus and not get dirt in the eyes.

&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; You can replace the front coupler and bushing without pulling the 
tranny,

 &gt; &gt; out.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Hi Matt,
 &gt; Fortunitly not!  We have done this replacement on VW buses from Clara's 
1953 
 &gt; to at least as late on our 1963 buses.  We just make sure to pop the 
tranny 
 &gt; in first or third and then once the coupler bolts are loosened swing the 
 &gt; shifter to where it would be in third or fourth gear.
 
  At worse one might 
 &gt; have to remove the shifter and then move the shift linkages forward.

 which is exaactly how they did it on my 66 last spring.
