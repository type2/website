Hi Volks,

Been thinking about the carabussing, I am getting real excited!  Just
want to throw out an idea to see what people think. I just recently
moved from central VA to Philly, so I know the area pretty weel.  I have
to believe that the easiest route from all coming from above central VA
would be to go down Rt 29.  Those folks coming down 95 south could go to
66 west, then onto 29 south.  The folks coming down 81 could either
catch 66 at Front Royal to 29, or cross the mountains using 33 at
Harrisonburg or 64 at Waynesboro. I am just trying to get as many buses
at possible together.  Somewhere in Charlottesville would be perfect.
Let me know what you all think.

Jamie Auch
