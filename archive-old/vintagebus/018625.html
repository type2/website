How does one clean a westy tent?

---------------------------------------------------
*Gently* with Woolite and a sponge and call it good.
---------------------------------------------------
Neil Young sings something about the having seen the
needle and the damage done... Yeah but has he seen 3M
scrubbies, Clorox and Softscrub screw up single cab
tilts and privy tents? Not to say that I know of
anyone STUPID enough to have ever done that, I'll
suffice to say that I highly recommend a gentle hand
and acceptance of minor blems.

Seriously check those goofy &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; like
using dry table salt to absorb oil stains like you'd
use kitty litter on a driveway, conservative use of
Go-jo and plenty of water in hidden-test areas for
more aggresive stains. TEST! before going nuts. Read
directions regarding bleaching of colors on the tents
like the '65-'79 tents. Gojo used to remove tar and
oil from clothing was recently discussed on the Land
Cruiser email list. I suggest the conservative
approach on non-replacable items.
