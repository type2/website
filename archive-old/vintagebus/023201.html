Tom Mink just bought a '59 slider-rag bug.  Not only did the rattle-can
prime over the OG paint, they painted right over everything across the dash
- speedo, knobs and all.  And this was one of those &quot;little old lady&quot; cars.

What makes it even funnier, is the seller actually used the term &quot;OG&quot; in
conversation!
