Subject: Re: [VB] Gas heater in a '70

&gt;I may have an oppurtunity to get the gas heater from a '70 bus. I want to
&gt;make sure I get it all. What parts are there that I need to make sure and
&gt;get off the bus so I can successfully install it into another bus.

You didn't mention which type of heater you are getting, but this should
cover both.

When salvaging the heater, make sure you get:

1.  the main heater with mounts.
2.  measure where the holes have been cut for the intake and exhaust
(cardboard template?)
3.  take the gas tank cover tin that has been cut.
4.  remove gas tank and get the duct beside the tank
5.  make a template for where the gas tank duct comes into the passenger
compartment.
6.  get the &quot;T&quot; fuel line fitting (you can get these at the hardware store)
7.  get the LOOOOOOONG lawn mower looking push pull cable with wires.
8.  get the switch and pull knob attached to the cable.  (there may also be
a timer)
