Hey all,

  For those of you in the Bay Area...

	I happened to pass by the local &quot;Pick 'n Pull&quot; yesterday and spotted
a '66 bus.

	It was pretty stripped internally, but there were still some parts.
It was a '66 camper.

	What's left that I can recall is:

	-Bench seat bulkhead (wall)
	-Front beam Drum to Drum
	-Tranny and Redux Gears.
	-Couple of rust pop outs.

	It's the Klauer Pick 'n Pull on Commercail.

	e-mail me if you want further details.

Happy Junking....
