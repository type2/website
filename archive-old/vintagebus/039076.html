Subject: Full Flow Filter Fitting Fquestion
Date: Wed, 26 Aug 1998 09:17:23 -0500

Sorry for all the 'F's in the subject, but 'F' words seem to flying
around my garage a lot lately as I re-assemble the engine for my 58.

Anyway, my question is...  I've had my case tapped for full flow.  But
what kind of fitting do I need to screw into the case that will clear
the behind-the-pulley sheetmetal?  Gotta be some kind of 90 degree
thingy.

Also, I was thinking about hanging the filter mount from the support
beam on the underside of the bed (roof of engine compartment), but on
further thinking, this sounds like a horrible idea.  If the hoses run UP
to the filter,  wouldn't all the oil run out of the lines everytime you
turn off your engine?  If so, obviously I need to hang the filter from
under the bus somewhere so the filter mount is no higher than the oil
pump.  Does this sound right?

Thanks.
