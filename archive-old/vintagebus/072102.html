Subject: Re: [VB] temp. question

I generally have just oil temps.  I do have some data on head temps vs rpms, 
and am trying to sort out how to put that on a webpage.    It did show cooler 
heads at 3000 rpms vs 3500.   I don't have info on how changing gearing makes 
temps different at the same speed, which is a piece of work!!!  interesting 
though.   I guess you'd either have to swap trannys or swap engines, make sure 
the engine is the same just the gearing differnt.  but you'd want the buses to 
have the same load, and not compare truck to bus, or have one w/ roof rack, 
anotehr w/o etc. just the reduce other variables.

still, my 65 westy with 3.88 r/p 1.26 rdgears, 195 75 14 LT tires does not 
run hot, neither of the motors I've had in it since that gearing went in. In 
fact, I didn't notice much temp differnce (oil temps) if any.   not hot means 
when warmed up generally 70 to 100 C, depending on outside temps/humidity.   Only 
times it got hot was up long grades in dry Arizona, laden, oil temps climbed 
to 230, though no head temp guage in it.  Even cruising the I5 in central CA 
on a hot summer day (90s?) it didn't go above 210F oil temps.  dryer air cools 
less efficiently, you know, as there is less stuff in the air to take the heat 
from the engine.

 I can see 2800rpm being a sweet spot that makes the engine run cool, but
 what i'm talking about is at full highway speed, lets say, 65mph. Don't
 worry, I don't drive my bus at 3800rpm in third or second gear. :-)
 
 If you geared your trans to push your bus 65mph at 2800rpm, it will run very
 hot, as opposed to if it is geared to run about 3800rpm while doing 65mph.
 That's what i'm trying to say.
 
 Do you run head and oil temp gauges, or just oil temp? I run both on mine.
 It's nice to have info. I'm actually trying to get ahold of a two sensor &gt;&gt;
