Subject: Re: [VB] Havasu (was tx trip)

&gt; OK, if JP will let me I'll follow him to Havasu, and
&gt; when I get there I
&gt; believe I'll have a Vodka and Tonic with JP and
&gt; ruminate on MPG.

Don't forget, any listee coming by my fire pit is
welcome to a V&amp;T.  And you've got to help me burn all
my firewood, so I have room in my trailer for my spare
engine Jon Furst (hazetguy_at_earthlink_dot_net) is returning
to me.

&gt; About lightening
&gt; the load, I sure hate to
&gt; leave behind my spare engine.  I just know I'll
&gt; throw a rod if I don't
&gt; travel with the spare.  No roof rack though.  JP has
&gt; ALL that stuff on the
&gt; top of his bus, seems like I should at least throw
&gt; in a spare engine and
&gt; bottle of vodka.

I agree.  (Not about the Vodka.)  I'm afraid if I
don't take my spare engine on to California with me
when I get it back from Jon that I'll throw a rod. 
BBBV (or was it IV?) wasn't good to me engine-wise. 
(Dropped #3 exhaust valve head into combustion chamber
- not pretty)  Barry has offered to take it straight
back to Albuquerque, but my trailer should be empty
anyway, right?  AND I get lousy gas mileage with all
that stuff on my rack and the speeds I drive!
