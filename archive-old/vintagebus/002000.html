Please help,

My red light is on, the generator light to be specific.  I smelled something
sorta burning while driving on the freeway.  Then my red light came on.  I
stopped, opened the rear lid and found little pieces of cloth type thread
stuff lying around the engine that should be in the generator where the
windings are.  I know this because I just had the same problem a month ago,
funny smell, red light, cloth type thread lying around the engine bay.....
The generator is a rebuilt one that I installed a month ago.  Saturday night
when driving home my headlights were getting brighter the faster I drove.
This worried me, but I thought that since the generator is new it must be
the regulator.  So I put a new regulator in, polarized and all, but that
hasn't eliminated the red light. What would cause the generator to fall
apart like that?  My engine is a duel port 1600.  Please help, I have to
drive to LA tomorrow for school and don't want to destroy my bus, but I have
a ton of work there.  With the red light on could I just buy a new battery
and just swap batteries when they get low until I can find a way to fix
this?  Help.
