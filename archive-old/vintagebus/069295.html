Subject: Re: [VB] Engine bolt question.

AHHHH yes! I remember that bolt. Pain in the ass for sure. There's a way 
you can lay and your right arm will go up there. Clara I think describes it 
real good. Then you have to slowly wrench it off with about 1/4 of a turn 
at most at a time. Very frustrating and even harder if your a fat guy like 
me and your arm is a tight fit.

I later figured out that I could put a long deep socket on my air impact 
wrench. I could fish the gun up into the area. It ended up kinda upside 
down or something. I'd make sure it was on the bolt head good and then zap 
it off. Worked much faster. Goes back in a simular way. Only problem is if 
your not carefull it'll bugger up the head of the bolt. Just make sure 
you've got it on there good and it's not spinning and banging that head bolt.
