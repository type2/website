US spec cars did not have semaphores.  You would have nipple turn
signals (also known as &quot;bullet&quot;, if you're a fighter, not a lover)

Keep 'em; unless you were going to install semaphores, why would you
remove them?

&gt; My 55 (non barn door) pickup has front turnsignals that look like late 50s

&gt; spirit of safety?
