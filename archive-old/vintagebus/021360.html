&lt;&lt; I think Bernie Bergman (I think thats the name) sells a set up like that.  
cooler thermostat and electric fan. He also does alot of the type I/II 
hydrolic lifter engines, Does anyone have any experience with these? Never 
adjusting my valves again sure sounds good. I've heard good things but 
nothing on longevity.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Disconcerter,
A friend of ours bought one of Bernie's engines with hydralic valves.  Result 
was an engine months late, and some of the hydralic valves do not pressure up 
until 15 minutes or so later.  
  Hydralic valves have to be adjusted!  Just not as often.  We prefer solid 
tappets/lifters because you can actually keep an eye on the health of the 
valves.  Hopefully you only need at most to slightly adjust two or four 
valves every tune up once the engine is worn in properly.  Most times we only 
have to adjust one or two, and sometimes none.  If a valve consistantly needs 
quite a bit of adjustment there is a problem with the valve linkage, the 
valve seat or the valve stem itself is stretching.  The latter resulting in a 
boken valve damaging/destroying the piston, and even the head.  You can even 
tell if an engine is getting over heated just by having several of the exaust 
valves stretching suddenly after running in hot weather.  Also from what we 
understand the hydralics actually rob a bit of HP from the engine!   Eric&amp;Barb
