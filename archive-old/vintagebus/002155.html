&gt;watch for JEROME stories soon, no holes barred

Folks, it looks like the sucky trip reports on Jerome are a little slow
coming, and I think it's because this event is more exhausting than a normal
VW event. This is due to the fact that rather than walk by displays of
prettied up Volkswagens and maybe saying hello to the owner, you walk by a
campsite with driven Volkswagens and as like as not you'll end up hanging
around for a while and shooting the bull, eating whatever they're cooking,
or drinking beer and Tequila into the wee hours. You stay up late and wake
up early. Lots to do, and none of it involves wet t-shirt contests or engine
blows. These time honored rituals would prove to be entirely too much for an
event that for some goes three days not counting the drive, and for some of
the club members making it all come off, five, again not counting the drive.
The long distance winner this year was from Florida. Five days to get there.
This is more like moving into a neighborhood that is all VW bus, all the
time. Not so much of a swap meet, per se, everyone is selling stuff in their
campsites. New vendor area limited to ten spaces as this is a non-commercial
event, but the availability of a lot of these parts was a real convenience.
If you make one event all year, this is the one. Start making plans now. Set
your valves. Grease your squeaky things. Grease them again, Clara loves
grease.

&gt;be there or be a water pumper


I resemble that remark. I happen to have a water pumper split window thank
you very much. And VanBondo was towed into the Jamboree by one (ouch). I'm
sure he will report on that later. And both the F*~d that towed Ellis and my
water pumper will be at Buses by the Bridge III. See you there.
