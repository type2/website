Dave Jersey's post is a good suggestion I have seen work.  Be careful, you
want the nut really hot, don't burn yourself when things slip. As he
suggested, make sure you are turning the thing counter clockwise.  Get a
friend to hold the screwdriver.  Then there are the last resort, meataxe
approaches.  Perhaps you can find a large pipe wrench to hold the pulley (it
is probably bent from all the twisting anyway).  Worst case, take it to a
shop where they can use an impact wrench on it.  This could pe the source of
the problem, but sometimes they just get stuck.
