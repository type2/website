That is the same cam I have in my wifes 65 Beetle, I tore down a Brand New
Mexican long block just to instal the cam. She gets 35 MPG on the highway at
65 mph.

Hello!

There was a new Engle 100 cam in this engine
(I don't know if it was broken in right...???)...the machinist I was talking
to said that even an E100 is too severe for the heads/guides/valves/seats,
and will cause premature head failures.  Is this true?  I thought that the
E100 was considered &quot;mild&quot; as far as performance cams go, and would add just
a bit of &quot;oomph&quot; torque-wise.  Any comments on this?  It seems that it is
pretty common to use these cams.....I would love your thoughts!

Thanks!

Gene
