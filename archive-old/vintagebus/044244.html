I would appreciate some help on a problem that has me stumped.  I have been working w/ limited success for a long time to solve an overheating problem in my 1970 Westfalia w/ a 1600 dual port motor.  By overheating I mean that the Gene Berg dipstick sensor causes the oil pressure idiot light to flash at 60 mph on an interestate w/ small, rolling hills on a warm day (70 degrees or more ambient temp)-i.e. 225 deg. F.  My CHT gauge runs around 300 deg. F.  I have looked at a very wide variety of potential causes which I will not detail here, but one problem that I can't figure out is how to fix the loose fan belt.  When I say loose, I mean that a new Continental 9.5X905 belt installed w/ no shims b/t the fan pulley halves is loose enough to slip under load.  I have taken a variety of steps to fix this (each step involved a different, new Continental 9.5X905 fan belt unless otherwise noted):

Original set-up:  stock crank pulley from an old single port motor (probably 1.9:1 ratio), generator, old fan pulley.  I did not measure the ratio of turns of the crankshaft to turns of the fan.  An 2 yr old, stock fan belt was loose w/ no shims b/t pulley halves.  Motor ran hot.

Replaced generator &amp; generator stand w/ rblt Bosch alternator and used, stock alternator stand.  No change in overheating problem.  The ratio of turns of the crankshaft to turns of the fan was appx. 1.7:1; the fan belt was loose enough to slip w/ no shims b/t the fan pulley halves.

Replaced crankshaft pulley w/ one from a dual port bug.  This pulley has three timing marks on it, which, according to the data I've looked at, means that it must have come off a dual port 1600 bug motor.  Given this source, I conclude that this must be at least a 2:1 ratio pulley.  The new pulley did not help the overheating problem.  The ratio of turns of the fan to turns of the crankshaft was appx. 1.7:1.  The overheating problem continued.

Replaced stock fan belt w/ Gates 9.5/10X920.  This fan belt is one size smaller than the belt sold by Gates for the 1600 dual port motor (a 9.5/10X930).  The new fan belt helped some-the fan belt is tight w/ three shims b/t the fan pulley halves.  However, the ratio of turns of the fan to turns of the crank shaft is still 1.7:1.  The fan belt rides near the outer edge of the fan pulley.  The motor seems to run a little cooler, but I haven't been able to give it a good test yet.  I tried the next size down Gates belt (9.5/10X905), but it is too tight to fit.

The low ratio of turns of the fan to turns of the crankshaft means that my fan is turning slower than VW intended.  This is certainly not helping cooling-by my calculation, fan speed is 15% less than spec (spec is at least 2:1 and was 2.1:1 on some motors according to Barb&amp;Eric).

I realize that many, many factors can contribute to overheating, and I have addressed most of those.  Independent of the other factors however, my fan speed should meet the VW specification.  I can't figure out what the problem is though.  I have changed the crank pulley, fan pulley, and gen/alt stand w/ no change in the problem.  What other components could possibly be the cause here?  The motor is a new rebuild by a reputable builder, but the case was line bored-could the crankshaft position have been altered by that process in such a way as to cause this problem?  Any help appreciated.
