Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Battery Repair?

Everyone is telling this poor soul on how to repair a battery, but the damage 
from a leaking battery will do more damage then what is worth (I.E., batt 
tray, quarter panel and anything else under it ). Not only that but a chance of 
this battery exploding from lack of fluids and heating up .for a mere sum of 
65.00 think of all the headaches you'll save by spending a little extra is your 
bus not worth it, i know some guys in bus group are frugal but there has to be 
line drawn somewhere. only my opinon as a firefighter
