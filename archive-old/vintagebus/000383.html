&lt;&lt; I have a busted flange on my early oil cooler on my 1600sp (engine
 #B6414037).  Therefore, a replacement is in order.  I has been suggested
 that I switch to a doghouse and a type 4 cooler.  I like the idea.
 
 However, I am rather conservative, and sometimes find that modifcations
 do not always deliver what one expects.
 
 (FYI: I live in the San Fran area, and will be in +100 temps in the
 central valley on occasion, and some climbs into the Sierra.)

FWIW, the doghouse was stock on later vws (from 71 or so).  It is tried and 
true for decades and is an easy this to do, and is a better cooling system, I 
recommend going that way rather than staying with the upright cooler.

I put the type IV style doghouse deal on my 65 westy in September, and guess 
I'll see what the difference is in the summer, as it seems my thermostat 
doesn't open up much this time of year in any case, but I hope it will be 
better come the hot weather.


I got the modified doghouse set up from Eric (Veewee111) and found me a type 
IV cooler.  If anyone is interested, I can get more type IV coolers, though I 
am not checking the emails much these days, so don't be worried if it takes a 
week for me to respond.

The typeIV cooler bolts on the same as the regular doghouse, but is thicker, 
more oil passages, so more cooling.  But some bits of the stock doghouse tin 
would have to be widened to fit (the fan housing, cover that goes over the 
cooler, and the L air deflector )

Do get the thermostat stuff as well.   Especially with the type IV thing, you 
dont want the bus to run too cold in winter. 

with these in place, it will help the engine run not too cold, not too hot, 
but just right.
