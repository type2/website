Subject: RE: [VB] Question about body prep

&gt; Sanding is no fun, it takes forever, and you'll spend that much in paper
and&gt; supplies anyway. Your time is worth something.&quot;
Definitely.  Just be sure that they are using the correct media (I would
reccomend soda) as straight sand will warp the sides, look at some of their
other work, find out if they will do the priming, find out what kind of primer
they use, make sure they are not going to paint over sand drifts left over
from blasting&gt; &gt; Question . . . is his advice on the right track? He said it
would be about&gt; $200-300 to have it blasted.

Maybe if it is just for the outside.  Do you have inside storage if you're not
going to paint right away?&gt; What say ye resto been-there-done-that people? I
have no illusions, this is&gt; going to be a couple of years project.

If you can get soda blasting, pick it up, wipe down with a good metal prep,
prime with the appropriate primer for the paint or paint system you will be
using, and get it inside, it would be a huge leap forward for a project.
If you cant get soda, check out Eastwood and look at their blasting media.
Good info.  Maybe you buy the media and give it to the blaster. Talk to
several blasters, dont go with the cheapest, but go with the guy who is most
willing to work with you.  Check with bodyshops in the area and ask them who
they use.  Go to a car show or contact a club locally.  Proper prior planning
prevents piss-poor peformance.  Either that or it ends up in the classifieds
in two years &quot;just don't have time for it&quot;.

BTW, yeah, been there, done that a few times.  Not an expert by any means.JT
