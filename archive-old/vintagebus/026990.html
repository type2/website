Subject: 67 Cargo Door handle Question

Hey all,

I've got a 67 and the one key operation works on everything but the
cargo door handle.  Shouldn't this be keyed the same as the others?

The number on the handle is 221 841 631 E  which my parts book lists as
&quot;from Chassis No. 1 222 026 up to 226 190 000&quot; and it also list 221 841
631 E (the exact same # BTW) as &quot;from Chassis No. 1 222 026 up to 216
190 000&quot;   I noticed also that the &quot;H&quot; version of the handle is listed
as &quot;from Chassis No. 217 000 001&quot; which is '67 and I guess the handle I
should have.

The part looks original, but who knows.  I know I can re code the lock,
but I'm just curious.  Any input from the part number gurus??  Was the
handle changed at some point?

Thanks.

Steve
