If you look at the stampings, it looks like the round mirror that I just got
from Wolfsburg whom claimed they were NOS!... however, the VW stamp is quite
blurred and there is also some form of yin-yang symbol as well.

Anybody have an original so we all know what should be stamped on it????

&gt;mirrors Ronnie sells for $36 dollars!!  The seller is claiming they are
NOS.
