Subject: Re: [VB] Flywheel/Engine troubles

spec is much less than 5mm... it should be a hair (around 4 to 6 thousandths 
of an inch... closer to 0.1mm I think) Spec is in Muirs book, the Bentley, and 
many other VW manuals. I'll bet you a donut your main bearings are bad and 
the bottom end needs rebuilding.   With than much end play the FW tends to smack 
against the case and damage it there.   with FW off, push pull the crank 
pulley and watch to see if the front main bearing (the one under the FW area) 
moves... it shouldn't.   You can't shim that much play out..  Do you have one of 
those FW lock tools?   sometimes I need a friend to stand on the other side of 
the motor while I push on the Persuader (cheater pipe) on the 3/4&quot; slide bar 
with 36mm socket

flywheel is still attached to the engine (boy aren't
they fun to get off?).  When I push and pull on it
there is about 5 millimeters worth of play.  Is that
normal or should I go through more of a engine rebuild
than just a flywheel replacement?  Maybe I just need
some shims/washers to take out the play when I put a
new flywheel on?
