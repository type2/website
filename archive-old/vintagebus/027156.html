Subject: paint questions

It is that time for me to track down a painter that will paint my newly
straightened front bumper.  I found a local place that carries Glasurit
paint.  He seems to know his stuff about this paint, maybe too much.  He
stated that he had to call a vendor to match the L82 silver white
paint.  He later called me back and asked me way too many questions.
I was hoping that the list could help a friend in need.  Below are his
questions.

1.  Was this bumper painted in single or base/clear coat?  I said it
should of been single stage.  I was not sure about that.

2.  Is this paint a metallic color?  I said that it is a very silverish
white-blue color but it did not have any metallic in it.  (please
correct me if I am wrong).

3. How shinny is the final product?  I really could not answer this
question.  I did not think that it was a gloss finish nor a flat
finish.  He said that he would have to add a flattener if the final coat
was not shinny.

4. He stated that all they make now are eurothane paints and they used
acrylic paints originally on the VWs.  I stated that it was painted in
the &quot;21&quot; series of paint.  He then said that they make the &quot;22&quot; line to
match this.  (Ask you can tell it is the blind leading the blind).

Any suggestions for me?  I told him that I would need to talk to some
&quot;friends&quot; and then I would give him a call on Wednesday. TIA.
