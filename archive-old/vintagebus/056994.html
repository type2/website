&gt; Has anyone here run the oversized crank pully (20% larger) that some vendors

&gt; I figure, withour lower rpms, we dont have to worry about the fan coming
&gt; apart from the extra rpms, and the extra cooling couldn't hurt anyway when
&gt; we start hitting over 100 degree temps.  (run a stock pulley in winter
&gt; months)
&gt; thanks for any input.

Do we really run lower RPMs?  Perhaps our peak RPMs might be less than the
racerboys, but our average running RPMs are higher.

I'm also skeptical of whether a faster fan would move more air through the
limited space of the finning and oil cooler

If I was experimenting with this, I'd run a welded and balanced fan with
this setup, as well as an alternator (less rotating mass than the generator)
