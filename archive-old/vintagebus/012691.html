Subject: 66/67 non slash bumper??

Hey gang,
I just spoke to gentleman that did some work on my 75
camper and I was going to be in his neck of the woods
this weekend and I checked to see if he had any rear
66/67 bumpers. He said he had 2 but was going to use
them on a 60 and 63 he is restoring, I think.  I
indicated that I have a front and rear non
overrider/slash style bumper that would be legitimate
for his vans. He said the rounded style bumper came
out in 63 w/the change in turn signals.  I respect his
opinion but I thought that 66/67 rounded were those
years only.  If so I have a bargaining point and we
both win, I would try to trade my 2 for his 1,
HOPEFULLY.  I am slowly obtaining all those things to
complete my 67!  Thanks and keep on bussin,
