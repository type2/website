I don't know exactly what kind of measuring tools you are looking for (late
on the thread) but I just got a catalog from Airgas Direct Industrial
(800-289-4787)  on my desk and they have  what is labeled a &quot;Super Buy&quot;.
they are 8&quot; percision dial calipers for 19.95 and 33.95. (one has smaller
graduations)  They are metal and not plastic.  I have had a set of these for
about a year now.  They work good and are accurate.  They are no frills like
digital or titanium tips but for 19.95 you can drop several of them :)  They
also have some good deals on micrometers.  I have no affiliation with this
company, just thought I would pass the sale along.
