One of NQ's mechanical tips was employed on Saturday,
July 14. 

Several listees were supposedly working on the  raffle
bus for the upcoming Jerome Jamboree 11. John Howard
was attempting to loosen the threaded nut-fitting at
the end of the drivers side front brakeline. It was
not attached to the wheel cyl but would not spin free
on the brakeline as it should. Kyle, Joe Ginter, Jon
Stanton and self were supervising. Parafin wax was
melted into the &quot;stuck&quot; piece. We then went and drank
beer while the wax settled into place. =) The tip was
acknowledged as being a &quot;NQ Thing&quot;. Here's to NQ...
I wonder if that stuck piece ever was loosened. I
think that we forgot to check on it again. Good beer.
;-)

Thanks for the tip and welcome back NQ~! Forget the
critics- I figure if more people posted then we all
would blend in...
