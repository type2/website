When I did the cables in the '56 and the '55, I don't recall it going thry
the an enclosed tube any significant distance.  The only case I can think
of would be a belly pan bus, and in that case it would be rubber on steel,
which doesn't seem to corrode as badly.

The replacement cable consists of the sleeve *and* the cable; it works for
either gas or choke - you have to cut it to length just like a bike cable.

Unscrew the knurled retained under the seat, behind the cable pull, undo
the cable attach points - there's a couple clamps and ties along the way -
and pull that bad boy out!
