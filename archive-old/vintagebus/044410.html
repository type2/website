Subject: Re: [VB] wheel fell off!!??_at__at_#

Gee, this story sounds familiar. In case anybody missed it, this 
exact thing happened to me a few months back. Check the archives. The 
simularity is &quot;haunting&quot;..ooooohhhhhh.

When I tell my story to longtime VW guys, they all have a simular 
story to tell. Happens more than you think.

You can see the picture of my wheel well damage right after it 
happened to me on my webpage http://www.type2guy_dot_com

&gt;Omigod.
&gt;So I'm driving home when suddenly bang! The driver's side drops, I see my
&gt;tire take off into the neighbour's yard, and my bus slides along on the
&gt;pavement.  I steer to the side and stop, look out expecting to see the drum
&gt;gone and the backing plate bent to s^*t on the cement.  Instead the drum is
&gt;resting on pavement.  To make matters worse, one of the bolts hit another
&gt;driver's car and made a big dent in the hood.  So I guess my insurance will
&gt;go up.
&gt;
&gt;I managed to find 3 out of the 5 bolts on the ground, all the while thinking
&gt;to myself, damn, how could I have forgotten to tighten those up?  How could
&gt;I be so stupid?  Put the 3 bolts on, took one out of the other side so I now
&gt;have 4 on each front wheel.  Damn.  Then I realize.  I never took those
&gt;bolts off at all.  I took off the whole drum and wheel attached on that
&gt;side.  Weird.
&gt;
&gt;Pretty scary, but the bus isn't too bad.  Seems to be driving ok, of course
&gt;the nice new dogleg on that side is pretty well munched.  &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt;thanks 4 listening,
&gt;Diana
