That's what I figure. He can't balance them though - doesn't have the
thingee to do it. Nor does he have the on-the-car balancer either.

&gt; I'm very happy with mine.  The only place they are not good is in snow
&gt; where they are the next best thing to teflon.  On dry or wet pavement they
&gt; are quiet and wear well.

How stable are they at highway speed in wet weather?  This is critical for
me.

Thanks!
