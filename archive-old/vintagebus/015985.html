RTV does have a tendancy to break down.  Once had an experienc where a pipe 
entering a pressure washer was sealed with silicon. It crumbled off and got 
in the pump just destroyed the inside.  had to have it rebuilt $$$$. :(  I 
wouldn't trust the stuff on anything that may have moving and or critical 
parts near it. FWIW
