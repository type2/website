Youve got to agree that the splitty buses are the cutest of them all! 
Always resembling a happy face and with the friendly curves.  From the
front it even looks like a supportive uncle.  So it's nice to have all
the splitty enthusiest because it's a good thing to save  these buses
from death as long as possible.
One question.  A lot of the split window buses have this over head
fresh air vent in the front up on the ceiling.  Does it work by ram
air or does it also have an electric fan in it?

Sorry about the none VW content but I felt the need share this with
you.
RENT the musical.  The soundtrak has had a huge effect on my life.  I
have asked many people I know and none of them know much about it
although they have heard of it.  Anyways the reason for me sending
this message unrelated to VW's is that I am very desperate to know
======= = = = = =
why dont you find a musicals list and ask them there.  this is clearly
not
about splitty buses.  clutter clutterclutter clutter.
