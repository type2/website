Subject: RE: [VB] Nuts size, Big nuts vs Small nuts...

It all depends... some prefer peanuts, some the larger brazilian nuts.
You could go after tagua nuts (any woodworkers out there?) or then there
is the ever popular coconut.  Its not just small vs big here.

Hey, it is Friday here...


Small nut, early, large nut later.  36mm vs 46mm.  at least 67 had the
big nut.  The Big nut version is obviously intended to be more beefy...
or should that be meaty since you call the edible part inside the 'meat'
of the nut?

I'm afraid I am about to show my ignorance, but will
someone explain the difference to me between Big nut
tranny and small nut tranny. I am ASSUMING that the
nut size refers to the axle nut that holds the wheel
hubs on, is this correct?? 
So what years had big nuts nad what years had small
nuts, and are there andvatges to having one versus the other??
