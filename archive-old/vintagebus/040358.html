Pulled the engine and passenger side head to put insert into #2 spark plug hole this weekend...# 1 was bad too. Inserted that one as well. The thing I don't like about inserts is that you tap a hole into the head that makes the distance between the spark plug and the valve less. This area is prone to cracks. With a larger spark plug hole, it is certain to be more prone to cracks. Oh well. I'm poor; rather buy the tool and spend $30 fixing a head than replace a good head with money I can't afford to spend.

Took time to investigate the guides on the other head. Doh! One of the guides was loose; sliding around. These are heads of unknown origin; someone drilled the hole too big...by a tad. Like I said, I'm poor. Called Ken and whined. He had no sage words of wisdom, but he did have valve-spring compressor. Thanks for the loan, Ken! I removed the valve spring and the valve...guide slid right out with a few light taps from a hammer.

I looked at this and looked at the head. I figured I was now going to have to buy another head, but I kept thinking about how I might fix this. I remembered Bob taking about scoring metal to raise it a little. I didn't remember the context, but I knew this was probably a good application of that concept. So...with nothing to loose, I tried it. After a couple of failed attempts--do not use a hammer directly on the guide as this bends it slightly; use a block of wood and light taps--this is what I did:

1 - I scored the inside of the head where the guide goes. I used a screwdriver and hammer to do this.

2 - I scored the outside of the guide. I used a pair of vice-grips and a hammer (hammering on the vice grips with the guide sitting on wood).

3 - I cleaned up all the loose metal from this scoring process.

4 - I inserted the guide slowly using hammer and wood...see note above. Cost me 2 guides and about 1/2 hour to learn not to hit the guide with a hammer directly.

Now, I ain't no mechanic. This may be the worst idea since the transfer of long-range missile technology to China. But, the valve guide ain't movin' no more and the $72 it would cost for the SIR rebuilt head is still in the grocery budget.

As a side note, I do have another guide in this head that is moving about 1/8 &quot; back and forth - intake. I left it in, as I don't have a press and I was afraid I wouldn't get it out of the head without mushrooming the tail end of the guide. I probably should heat the head and then drive that guide out. I think that's how you do it; but if I screw up, I'll be short one head. I also know I won't be able to use the oven for this. Can you heat the head with a torch to do this? I figure I can watch the guide and pull it in another 3-5 thousand miles when it moves around and makes more clearance for itself. That will require another disassembly of this engine, but maybe it will keep me from loosing a head. Hmmmm...does it sound to anyone else like I'm being a whimp about this, or is it just me? ;) Joe

Thanks! Joe
