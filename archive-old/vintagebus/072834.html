&gt; 
&gt; Hi
  We are in Pine River Wisconsin driving the white 68 double cab with the
black brazilian tilt.  
  The transmission is making noise.  It is a funny noise when we let the
clutch out, the noise goes away when we push the clutch in.  We suspect a
transmission problem.  Nothing is leaking, engine sounds good.
  We are going to try to make it down to Minneapolis, where there are a
bunch of AIRS folks.  We will need to pull the engine and probably need to
find a transmission. 
  We will be travelling down 371 to 10 and into the Cities.  We will try
to stay off 94.
  We have started contacting folks off the airs list but if you could send 
out our situation report to vintage bus and type 2 list we would
appreciate it.  Folks need to p-mail us ( matchka_at_earthlink_dot_net ) and we will be
checking.  We are at the public library accessing our email so we will check
again before we leave.

  Thank you.

P &amp; C
