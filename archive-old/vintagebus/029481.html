&lt;&lt;For whatever reason this one hit my nerves this time.  Maybe too much
coffee this morning.&gt;&gt;

Jeeeezzzee!!! I had no idea that my post would create such a stir. The
first  I discovered their might be a problem was this afternoon when I
read a reply from Clara.

So i get home this evening and read the responce from Robert. . . and
all I can say is that there was no venum contained in the spirit of my
initial remarks. I admit, I used the term &quot;vintage nazi&quot; which I suppose
sets a lot of people off. But it has been brandished around quite a bit
here, and I only used it tongue in cheek. I will admit, that I have a
little trouble understanding the mindset, but not too much, since my own
restoration will be a pretty &quot;pure&quot; one. But probably not down to the
logos. But even still, what I said was not meant as criticism of people
that wish to be such purists. . . only to offer a suggestion on
recreating the little logos.

I guess maybe us East Coasters are a little more thick skinned. Reminds
me of an old Root Boy Slim song. But I won't tell you which one for fear
of setting everybody off the edge again.

Chilllllllllll.

Sheeeeezh.
