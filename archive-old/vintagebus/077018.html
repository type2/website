Subject: Ugly 65-67 front seat pics?

ON the quest to find any pics of a 65-67 bus w/ the stock mesh
gray/gray I still haven't found any :(

Is this combo that ugly. seems like every pic I can find had a
different seat cover. I pulled some of the &quot;cover&quot; off my pass seat to
see what it looks like, but that crap is UGLY! I suppose I'm just
trying to decide if I want to go with the stock color scheme on the
front or just go with something else like the kombi gray from earlier
models, but not sure if the material I am looking at has simply aged
bad (i.e. yellowed).
