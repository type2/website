Hi all. I'll out to lunch for about 3 weeks in Canada. So... we unsubcribe
and I will try to get to those that have asked about some various parts. If
not now, then in three weeks. While Lucinda stays home, Siegfried(86 Westy
syncro) goes. Lots of nice splits at the NHVWC show this weekend. Good time
for all!
        See you in 3 weeks.
        Mike
