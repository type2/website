Hi list,

There is an Amazon type book distributing outfit that have started up in
South Africa and they are having a 50% off startup sale. They list most of
the bus related books that are to be found on Amazon at, for the moment at
least, a little under 50% off Amazon's dollar price.

End of backround, beginning of question. If they list a book as having the
same ISBN no and title as the Bentley but credit someone else(Brooklands) as
the publisher is it the same book. ie does an ISBN no uniquely identify a
title?

TIA

Michael
