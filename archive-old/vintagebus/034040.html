&lt;&lt; if i stop accelerating the noise ceases. it continues into

 problem in the transaxle? a CV joint or reduction box problem. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Well a guess is it is either a bearing in the tranny going bad, or the R&amp;P is 
not set quite right.  The former is more likely though.  Change you tranny 
oil especially if you have not done so in 20,000 miles, or who knows when.  
Check for steel chunks, if you only get some from the reduction boxes then 
figure to replace the reduction bearings ASAP.  If there are lots and big 
chunks from the center section start to save up at least $500.00 for a tranny 
rebuild and that will not cover the reduction bearings that you probably 
should need to replace at the same time.  Lastly you need o figutre if you 
have CV joints, or reduction boxes.  You can only have one or the other, not 
both.  Eric&amp;Barb
