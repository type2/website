Subject: Reflectors on South African buses

Hey Volks

The reflectors on most of the buses I've photographed round here have
generated some  questions and speculation.

A pair of honeycomb reflectors of a design approved by the SA Bureau of
Standards was required both front (white) and rear (red) on all vehicles in
South Africa. You will find these reflectors on all old buses of any
vintage, as this law existed since before the early 50s and has only fallen
away recently.

It is unlikely these reflectors would have appeared as an M-code, as every
one I have seen has been locally made, and was no doubt VWSA or dealer
installed.
