&gt; If you go here:  http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html
&gt; And put in 185 80 [no 82 choice] 14 on the left and 195 75 14 on the
right, you will see that the
&gt; 195/75 is .5% faster. The 195 tire is actually .2&quot; smaller in diameter.

Pretty close, stock tire diameter for our buses (according to Bently) is
25.8 inches. A 195/75R14 has a diameter of 25.5 inches. I've seen plenty of
bus people running the 185/75R14's thinking that was the proper tire size,
but they are only 24.9&quot; diameter with  a 3.6% difference in size from stock
diameter.

Also, the idea that lower rpm's will improve gas mileage is a huge
misconception. To go 60mph, you need &quot;X&quot; amount of hp. Regardless of what
rpm you're turning the motor at, you are making that same amount of power,
which means the engine is consuming the same amount of air/fuel mixture.
Mileage is not improved by putting in taller gears in (i.e. &quot;freeway
fliers&quot;, or fitting taller tires.
