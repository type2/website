Subject: skylight windows-advise needed

 Here's a question for someone with skylight window knowledge, which I
have a deficiency of. A few weeks ago I put skylights in with new rubber
from WW. I used the roofing tar around the window frame on the bus. On
some of the windows the outermost outside lip of the seal doesn't seem to
be seated far enough in against the roof of the bus. It just sticks out a
little past the roof instead of seating and sealing against the roof.
While I was putting them on I was pushing down on them with as much
pressure as I thought they could take. I've put in plenty of other
windows and never had this problem, but this is my first time to put in
skylights, and my first time to use roofing tar. Is there anything I can
do now to get them seated better, or is it too late : (    I was thinking
when the temperature gets up to 100 degrees or so maybe the tar would
soften and they might push in a little more, or should I try to warm it
up with a hair dryer, or maybe squirt WD-40 around the edge and push some
more, or am I out of luck? Or can I blame it on the wolfsburg west
rubber? Who makes the best skylight seals, WCM? Has anybody else had this
problem? Thanks in advance for any advise, Chris
