 what is the best way to clean the inside fo the intake manifold, or does it
 matter...should I just leave it as is...basically there is some carbon build
 up(black stuff) on the inside of it, and I will be reusing it on my new 
motor,
 i wasn't sure if i there was some way to clean that out?
  &gt;&gt;
The heat riser part you mean?  That is the small tube.  The purpose of that 
tube is to take exhaust gases, which are hot, and warm the intake.   This
 1) helps against carb icing, and 
2) makes for better fuel burning(power/gas milage etc). 

 On a motor with a clean tube, it gets hot near the middle of the maifold.  
On a clogged tube, it stays cool there, so it doesn't work.  So it will help 
the bus run better to clean it, even though it is a pain.

can you blow through it?   or poke a coat hanger pretty far?  I take a drill 
and drill the straight bit till it is mostly clear.   use a smaller bit to 
get a little round the corner.  I put a piece of broken clutch cable a bit 
longer than half the length of the heat riser end to end  in a drill, and 
drill BACKWARDS.  the backwards bit is crucial, or the wire twist will un 
wind and cause an unholy mess when they break off inside the heat riser.    
Actually I give it a mullet by breaking some of the wires off at different 
lengths and bending them out a tad so the scratchy surfaces chew up the 
carbon.  Hitting the intake wih a hammer can help too.   I do this over the 
garbage bucket, as  a pile of soot comes out.  Be sure to not over heat your 
drill.    Cause then you might call up a friend and say  &quot;hey can I borrow 
your drill, I burned mine up cleaning a manifold&quot;.  if they let you borrow it 
you know that's a good friend.   Once the tube is clear enough that there is 
a hole all the way through I might take the propane torch, and blow through 
it, and the stuff can burn.  put it in a vise or you'll play hot manifold, a 
great \X/ campout circle game.   the coloured flames that come out when you 
burn the stuff are cool looking.   

It may be easier to find a fairly clear one at a swap for $5.

Do 'they' sell new ones, and for how much?
