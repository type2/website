&lt;&lt; I looked at the accelerator pump, and it squirts gas alright.  I think the 
&quot;squirt amount&quot; is also adjustable by changing the pump rod.  Should I try to 
change this so it squirts more gas?  Or is it something else? &gt;&gt;
Hi Christen,
Could be, but first would check your pilot and main jet sizes first and then 
tune it according to the instructions we have in the type2 library!  If it 
still does not work get a graduated test tube to measure the accelerator pump 
output to the factorey specs.  Also test your distributor for advance on 
another VW.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Does anyone know where we could get a graduated test tube for 0 to 5 ccs?
