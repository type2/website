&gt; &gt; One question: why is the electrical inlet on the driver's side? Mine's
on
&gt; &gt; the left rear above the tail light. Is this because of the back-up
lights,
&gt; &gt; which I don't have?
&gt;
&gt; That's a good guess.  I have both a '65 and a early '67 (no back up
lights)
&gt; Westfalia, and both of them have the electrical outlets at the left rear.
&gt; Every 67 I have seen with reverse lights has had the outlet on the side
just
&gt; aft of the drivers door.  I never thought about it till you mentioned the
&gt; reverse lights...I just always thought it was a 67 only thing.


Well, that must be it. The Westfailure has two (2) electrical outlets on the
drivers side. Of course, it is two (2) 67's, so it is special. Twice as good
as any other '67.....
