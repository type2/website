Well I just got back from our local VW yard (or wooded hills you could say)in 
Spring Bay, IL.
I did pretty well ----
-I found a pair of accesory lights mounted to the back bumper of an early 
60's B*g.
The lens say Hella made in Germany on them and are almost exact to those 
reverse lights on 67?-71 busses. The body of the lights are nice chrome units 
that are in surprisingly good shape.  I have the complete assemblies minus 
the mounting bracket which can be easily fabricated (so rusty they broke when 
I applied light pressure on them).
Are these reverse lights or fog lights? If they are reverse can I install a 
switch under
the dash so I don't have to drill into the tranny? Where is a good spot to 
mount these   on an American Spec.- bumper? Are these common accesory lights.

Also found a bottom of a rear seat cover plate (brown w/ aluminum trim), a 
few nice ashtrays, and a bay - window shifter extension.
Too bad the only correct engine lid for a 59' they had was about the worst 
Ive ever seen (not even close to repairable)in the Midwest rot department:)

Thanx-
pete
