Morning,

Yesterday was a busy day -- started out at 7:20am meeting Rex to pick up his
new Double Cab.  Rex has been driving 18 hours + a diversion in Oregon to
check out a '66 Single Cab that was for sale.  ((BTW, about $1000 if anyone
wants details, p-mail me.  Right off of I5.))

I posted on all the aircooled lists I knew about for a breakfast at 8:15am
Sunday.  We had about 16 people all together show up, I considered that a
good turn out... got to meet a lot of local listees.  I can't really name
them all, but I'm glad I finally got to meet Fred from Tocoma after all the
time he and I have written.

Don't have a lot of time, but Rex Eastman and Mike Lewis helped me evaluate
and _purchase_ a 1965 Crew Cab.  This one is most likely more project than I
want... but the price was right....

Part of the price being right was that I worked out a deal to purchase it
_without engine_.  The guy I purchased it from was willing to drive to my
house, we pulled the engine -- loaded it into my '71 bus and drove the guy
home.  He was almost 2 hours south of here, so our 7:00am day didn't end
until 7:00pm.... One heck of a show day.

Questions about the '65 Crew.

The Behind-seat dividers have been cut out.  Here is behind the driver seat:

This is also the side of the driver seat, appears to be cut to me:

So I can assume my m-code plate is gone with the divider that was removed
from the passenger seat?

I will get photos of everything up over the next few days, I'm sure I'll
have lots of questions.  This is my first split and This one is a project --
but ready for me to put an engine in it and drive it!

P.S.  I'm still looking for a crew cab with better body.  Rex and Mike are
trying to convince me that welding is easier than I think it is... we will
see!
