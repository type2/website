&lt;&lt; my drums on my '65 bus are out of round. I am investigating into getting
 them skimmed (any advice?) but also, are these specific to type 2's?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Simon,
Best to not have them turned or only if absolutely necessary.  They are type 
2 only and the new drums availible are often poor in quality.  VW drums have 
very little material to turn out of them!  Check the type 2 shop manual for 
specs on when needed for turning and max diameter.  We have found that 
carefull braking for two or three weeks will solve the out of round problem 
by itself.  Dragging brakes down long hills and slamming them at the bottom 
will cause them to go out of round.
