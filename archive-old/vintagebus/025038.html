hi all-

Is this crewcab listed for sale a binz?  maybe looks like it to me.  I
noticed what looks to be wider rear passenger compartment windows and
the uneven shapes to the gate indents.  Maybe not, but if there was a
pic of the other side, a larger 3rd door would let us know or maybe you
know something?
