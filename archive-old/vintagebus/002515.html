Hey Aaron,
    For the most part, Westfalia didn't start using the jalousies(crank
outs) until 64/65.Before then you could have the popouts,but even popouts
were an option.If it's a Westy from that era (pre'65)  it should have a
&quot;submarine&quot; or &quot;smoking&quot; hatch in the roof.If it doesn't it is probably a US
conversion.

                Good Luck,

                                              woody

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;

&gt; Hi listies,
&gt;
&gt; Do any of the westie or camper knowledgable list members know if there
&gt; was a westy/camper made where they didn't change the windows from
&gt; pop-outs to the three or four panes or the crank out early sundial
&gt; kind.  I'm going to look at one today and I thought they all came with
&gt; the windows that crank out, but this one has regular pop-outs.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Aaron
&gt;
