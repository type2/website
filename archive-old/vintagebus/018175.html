Subject: muffler mess
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just installed a new German muffler setup from WW on
my stock 1500CC.

The parts involved are: 1. muffler, 2. damper pipe, 3.
bracket whick clamps onto damper pipe and bolts onto
driver's side of muffler, 4. tail pipe.

I installed the thing using common sense and the
Bentley manual, and I've run into two problems:

When I mounted the damper pipe bracket, the welded tab
about halfway down the damper pipe doesn't line up
with the welded tab on the muffler. They should align
and a bolt go through. The damper tab is about 1+inch
too far away. This further complicates matters as the
damper pipe, and bracket hit my driver's side bumper
bracket and the lower lip of the bumper, so I had to
loosen the bumper on that side to position it.
Tailpipe angles downward just clearing the bumper.
No apron clearance problems, since I don't have one
installed (light rear end damage ned to be fixed
first)

SO: Is there a way to tell if the rear end damage has
pushed the bumper towards the bus, and thus the damper
pipe? There is no visible crinkling behind the outer
sheet metal and it looks straight per the other not-so
damaged side. I think it may have more to do with the
damper pipe bracket offsetting the thing so far out
that the tabs don't match. I was going to ditch the
bracket and just attach the damper pipe to the muffler
via a bolt through the tab (and the flange clamp of
course). Would it hold up?

Has anyone else had this problem? (and Ronnie, please
don't flame me for not buying your hand-picked muffler
setup, if you have one, I've got enough hurt here
already, bud. Go easy)

Thanks,

Jason
67 deluxe&quot;DARTHVW&quot; -- gonna get some COLORBACK and
really buff out the black Maaco paint job. Then that
red beltline will really pop.
