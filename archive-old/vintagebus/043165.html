Utility knife???  Hopefully YOURS are not steel belted!!!!!!!
Use a sledge hammer to break the bead at the outer side of the tire...once
the bead is broken, by pushing down on the separated bead you should be
able to get a flat bar into the space that has opened up between the rim
and the tire.._dot_using two such flat bars...prying the tire bead up and over
the wheel rim edge and working around the wheel you should have no problem
getting them off.  MUCH easier than a utility knife for sure.

&gt; Anyone ever remove their own tires?  I've got a set of rims that I want to get blasted .  They've got bald tires on them I don't care to lose but don't feel it necessary to shell out $5 a rim for a shop to just dismount.  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut the tires off?  Could it be that 
&gt; simple?  tia
