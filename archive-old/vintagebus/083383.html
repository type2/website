Subject: Re: [VB] Cool tin?

Jake Raby has done extensive testing and found the &quot;cool tins&quot;  raised
engine temps in every application he put them in.

They came from Type III's, i'd leave them in Type III's. They are not
designed to work with the Type 1 cooling system.

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I'm doing a quick, partial top end rebuild on an older 1600.  Keeping the
&gt; old heads, (they look OK after cleanup), but replacing worn pistons and
&gt; cylinders.  I finally unpacked my set of 'cool tin', and am putting them
in
&gt; place of the under-cylinder deflectors.  Before it is too late, does
anyone
&gt; have any experience with this 'cool tin'?  The pistons I am replacing were
&gt; dished, btw, and the new ones are flat.  I know my CR will be higher, but
&gt; haven't really done the math.
