Now the fun part of switching the machine over for gas. I did this on mine a
few weeks ago and really love how the mig welds compared to the flux core.
You are probably an experienced welder, but I can say for me the best thing
I ever did was get a few pieces of used metal and started practicing my
welding before I moved to the truck, as it says in the video, if you do this
your 10th weld will be better than the first, and sure enough I can weld a
solid bead now! I also found a full hood at my supplier for under $30. witch
is a valuable asset.

Subject: [VB] Welder Gas


&gt; I finally got gas for my lincoln sp-100t welder. I bought the welder a few
&gt; months back, but only just now had the money to get the gas. It cost me
&gt; almost $200 for a tank full of gas!!! That was mainly the cost to buy the
&gt; actual tank. Luckily it's only $40 to get it refilled. At least it's done.
