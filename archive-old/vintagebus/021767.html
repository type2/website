Hi list, it's been a while since my last post, but since I know Brock
personally I figured I might write.
Brock's VW magazine as far as I see isn't a commercial site, but one of a
personal with a borderline commercial. He uses it to advertise peoples cars
that he finds on the internet or from ones he knows. I met him and as you can
see my bug was featured and still is on his VW of the month site. It's the
black ragtop bug with pol. 5-spokes.
He has a pretty nice site, but it's going through some major changes and isn't
fully up and running yet.
Any other question you can e-mail Brock himself through the link on his site.
