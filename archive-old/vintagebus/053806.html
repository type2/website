Hey, I'll second that! Dawn made the three-color bra for my 67 resto,
seven years ago, and it has held up perfectly, including the 5700 miles I
have recently driven around this country. I imagine it will still be fine
when I'm done with my travels, some 3400 miles more to go. 

She did the work in a timely manner, and even did some mods on it for me
later on, in a timely manner as well.
