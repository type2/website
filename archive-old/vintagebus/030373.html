Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Westy progress and question...

my brake pedal was staying down like that just before my trip to
california. It turned out that the bolt it pivots on had rusted in the
pedal arm and it was actually turning the bolt. I took the pedal out and
had to press the bolt out and then I cleaned it up with some steel wool
on a drill bit. I greased it up and reassembled it and it works great
now.
