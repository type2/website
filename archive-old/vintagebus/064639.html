&gt; Did my 12 volt system fry my 6 volt starter?  It made a really bad noise and 
&gt; I could smell it burning.

Hi Bart,
The time for maintenance sounds well past!  So go out and get a new one or 
pull out another used one.  Check you starter bushing and even the tip of the 
starter for wear.  Did you check the starter brushes and replace them before 
they got too short?  Did you ever clean out the old brush dust?  Many cheapy 
rebuilders will only install two of the original four starter brushes causing 
more wear on the two brushes and more heat in the armature sections then 
used.  We have been using 6 volt starters with 12 volt solinoids (To prevent 
hammering the starter and FW gears to death.) for years with no problems.  We 
use special 6 volt toothed 200mm FW and have literally walked our buses 
uphill in first gear with just starter power when the engine died in traffic!

&gt; I have also been having a problem w/ my 34 pict 3 carb and my 009.  I 
&gt; frequently stall at idle.  Will putting a pop rivet in the butterfly cure 
&gt; that?

Maybe, maybe not.  Could be the carb needs cleaning, rejetting or proper 
adjustment.

&gt; Maybe my frequent stalling and starting killed my starter?

Only if you are cranking on the starter for minutes at a time!
