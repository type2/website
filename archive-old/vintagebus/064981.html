Volks,
. . . I think our air-cooleds are truly the &quot;international vehicle.&quot;  Parts
from everywhere...
-------------------|

Right you are Curt. Even more than you think. I read in one of my Foreign Car
Digest magazines (circa 1959-1965~ish) that at one point in time VWAG was
importing the majority of their steel for the production of their/our aircooled
vehicles from the Pennsylvania,USA based USSteel Corp. I think that this was in
an issue of the magazine around 1963. A knee-jerk reaction would be to call my
statement rubbish or worse. I will try and find the article and post the
editorial content on this list or maybe scan it and post it on VWPlanet.
