Subject: ahhhhh, toasty

I spent sunday wiring open heater boxes, reattaching tubes from boxes to aft
&quot;Y&quot; , insulating the 3&quot; tube to the front.  Yikes! rust-o-rama at the junction
thru the forward outrigger. Gaping hole would *likely* lose a little heat (he,
he)  Knock it all away, recreate the joint with tin can, insulate it with
reflectix, tape it all up with aluminum tape.
Colorado got hit with our first snow of the winter yesterday.  Morning found
me with 11 degrees, and icey roads.  I go out to the truck and start up. Spins
merrily, coughs to life (choke non functional) goose it a bit to barely
stumble along, run to the engine hatch to manually open the &quot;stepped thingey&quot;
.  Inside the house to get ready to brave the traffic.
I come out wearing my &quot;driving attire&quot;: Huge red down parka,  ski gloves,
stocking cap, pile pants with nylon shell, sheepskin lined leather boots.
With the boots, black pants and red parka, I always feel like St Nick.

What's this, ice has melted from windshield?  Scrape residuals easily, kind of
melty.  Climb in to a somewhat warm cab...WOW.  I don't need to look like
santa claus when I drive anymore!
