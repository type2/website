&gt; What I can't find out is what the actual size of the stock bearing surface 
&gt; should be so I can measure to see if it's even possible to get a bearing that

Hi Jason,
That is commonly reffered to as the bearing thrust measurement.  That area of 
the case when new is 22mm thick, and any rebuild with this area less than 
20mm is a big mistake.
