Subject: shocking 53 bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

after driving around the 53 the other day, and stopping by to see how 
progress was with the bug's motor swap.   ever notice when you stop by to see 
how a project goes you lend a hand?  its okay, i just left when it got dark  
and realised that perhaps shocks needed replacement.  I ordered some new 
fronts with the Monroe# that Everett had used- they should be in tomorrow.   
then yesterday I pulled off the rear left shock, opened it up (dry)  

the lever shock is attached to the bus with two big bolts.  an arm goes over 
to the RGBox and attached to a thingy that bolts through the spring plate.   
after remaoval you can knock the dirt and crud off, and undo the 6 screws 
that are just like the cooling tin screws and take the cover off.   Then I 
half -assedly rinsed it out with solvents, and let it drip dry, and cut new 
gasket for the cover from a paper grocery bag.   filled the shock with 
hydraulic jack oil.   Suddenly  moving the lever had resistance!!! hooray!!!  
 put the cover on.   The cover has a old style number on it, it is so cool.  
installation should be the reverse of removal

but getting to the top big bolt is a real PITA.   very inaccessable.  Ended 
up loosely bolting the arm on, then the lower bolt- using my matco 19mm 
ratchet wrench, so excellent for these spaces where you cannot get a ratchet 
to fit, and then somehow managed to start the top bolt with my fingers 
contorted in a way they were not meant to go these thing must have been 
assembled by elves I tell you.  greasy grumpy elves. then got the rathcet 
wrench on the upper 19mm large bolt and it only had room for one maybe two 
clicks per swing of the wrench.  you couldn't do this with an open end

then did the other side.  quicker this time

alsop tightened up the left side reduction box bolts.  one spun.  they are a 
nut and bolt deal, no threaded bit to screw it into.   now I think the clunk 
will go away.  the other side was good.

managed to get the lower nuts off to remove the front shocks, but the upper 
ones didn't want to move.  deciding that I didn't need to fight it, i poured 
penetrating oil on it and greased the lower nuts and put them back on.  it 
felt like I could have broken something if I pulled harder.  on the bus that 
is, not on me.  I'll get the new fronts when the parts store opens and try 
again.   I guess I could grind or chisel.  D$^%N Rick borrowed the grinder. 
hm, gotta go.  look I woke up early just to change my shocks.  =)  what a nerd
