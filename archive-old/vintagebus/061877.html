&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; Barely made it to work today!  My oil filler thing just keeps backing of the
&gt; neck.  I have the little tool and keep tightening it to no avail!  

What tool are you using?  The tool with the dog ears is not the best. 
There just is not enough surface area on that tool to torque the nut
tight enough.  Get the tool that expands inside the nut, as you can
apply much more torque to the nut that way.
