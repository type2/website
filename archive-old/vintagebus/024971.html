&gt; Someone on the list a while ago wrote about a kit for a '66 or '67 21
&gt; window deluxe.  I lost the model # and consequently my hobby shop got me
&gt; the kit for the '67 panel.
&gt; Could you please re mail me the #'s so that they can get me the deluxe,
&gt; so that I can have both.  2 more for the collection.
&gt; Does anyone else collect models and kits of splitties?
&gt; If anyone else has some model #'s that I can order that would be cool.
&gt; I have just started collecting and have 3x panels, 2x 21w d'lux, a high
&gt; roof delivery van, 2x barn door d'lux (about 1&quot; in length apparently
&gt; made in about '53-'55 by LEGO found in a small town antique store for
&gt; $5ea) 1x b_at_y window, 1x B_at__at_tle, 2x K_at_rm_at_nn Ghi_at_ (one a pressed steel job
&gt; of a type 3 K.G. made mid '60s.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoying Split's of all shapes and sizes :-P
