Subject: RE: [VB] Battery hold down

The covers and straps are not rare... but some people price them that
way.  Check on thesamba or at a recent swap and you should find either
one of those items for 5-20 dollars.

Now for more rare, I've only found one of the original pressed board
pieces that fit into the battery cover... anybody have a real nice one
of those?
