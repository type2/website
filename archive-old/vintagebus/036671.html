Hi 

I have used both types of sender in my '60. The type of gauge didn't seem to
make any diff. My gauges read funky until I added a ground wire from the
sender's collar to a nice fresh hole on the body. In my case corrosion
between tank and body was the problem. As I remember mine wouldn't read
above a quarter full regardless of the position of the sender. I have found
the tube type to be more accurate but that may be due to me buying crap
brazilian 'toilet type' senders. The original tube sender/gauge setup in my
bus was so accurate that I could predict to within about a kolometre where I
would run out of fuel.

Later
