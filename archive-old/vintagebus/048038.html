I was leaving work yesterday and lo-and-behold a Single Cab passed right.....

noticing a 3rd brake light decklid, small-but-empty taillight holes and

uncut rear wheel wells. 


So, I was trying to figure out what year the 3rd brake light stopped.  Was

it '57?


My guess was the SC was a '56...

The brake light deck lid was discontinued 5th April 57, part way through the
57 model year.    Regardless of whether it was a euro model or not (semaphores
or not)
  
It was not a 3rd brake light, it was the *only* brakelight, and was replaced
by 2 brake lights, one in each  taillight - the round glass kind with screws
on the outside.

However, it could have been on a later truck (just to make things confusing),
small taillight holes through 61.
