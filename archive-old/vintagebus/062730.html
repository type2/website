Subject: Re: Cargo Lights

the wiring for these lights went back into the engine compartment. (at least 
they were supposed to :-) should be a black wire with an inline fuse. they 
were wired so they would with the ignition off.

&gt;Can anyone tell me how to trouble shoot the lights that are located on the
&gt;drivers side in the seating area?  These are in a 66, the overhead lights
&gt;work, but the two on the side do not.  The wires seem to disappear behind
&gt;the wall??
