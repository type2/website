I asked about the numbering scheme for general knowledge.  There are a lot
of references of the color wiring diagrams from Thom's vintagebus_dot_com
website for different parts like the windshield wiper relay and stuff like
that.  I just want to understand the way the electrical system works a
little better than I do now.  BTW, the circuit for the headlight
modification brightened up the lights like you would believe!
