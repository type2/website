Subject: Re: [VB] Berg shifters

I can't imagine how it would stress the tranny.  The principle is to change 
the leverage of the shifter thus getting a shorter throw in the handle.  The 
linkage moves the same amount it did with the original shifter.  It surely 
makes a big difference to the driver though.  My Berg gives crisp, short, 
positive shifts.  I can sit with my back on the seat and shift. No more seat 
calesthentics on the oar to change gears.

&gt; I searched the archives and found that the concense is that the Berg shifter 
&gt; is a very good unit. My question is.Is there any way that the after market 
&gt; shifter puts any undo strss or strain on the tranny under naormal driving?
