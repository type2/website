I learned while I was driving BMW cycles that if the bike was healed over for any length of time that the downhill cylinder would get a little oil in it and smoke when I started it. The solution was to park on the center stand if it would be parked for more than a couple of hours. It could be that you parked with the 3/4 side down? It could be that you're a little over filled with oil? Just some food for thought.
