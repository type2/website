&lt;&lt; From the tables and my calculations I think you have--
 4.375 r/p
 1.39 redux
 0.89 4th gear
 gives 12.5 in rolling radius
 
 This is the closest off the charts. &gt;&gt;

Thanks, I think you are right.  I programed the speed calculator into Excel 
and I get  numbers that match the tach and the speedo readings.  Glad I 
ordered that new trans last week (3.44 R&amp;P)  It make me cringe to think I 
have been spinning the engine that fast.  Thank goodness for well built heads 
with high rev springs!
