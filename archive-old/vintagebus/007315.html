I was able to find a bottle for my '67 Kombi some months ago on Everett's
site for $20, uncracked.  I had to find a pump top for it, and through
asking around on this very list :-O I was connected with a shop in
California that had several NOS pumps for sale.  $75, ouch!  But it's
wonderful.

I mention this only because you might benefit from a new
pump...unfortunately the receipt I have has no name, number, or anything
else on it!  I *think* the name was something along the lines of &quot;Orange
Performance.&quot;  Perhaps somebody on the list knows which shop I am speaking
of?

&gt; me too,  me too!!!  The black top on mine (the pump) is soooo bad that
every
&gt; time I touch it another piece falls out.  I hear they are really hard to
&gt; find (although I have not started looking yet).
