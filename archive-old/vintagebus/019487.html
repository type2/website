&gt;I just scored a tent like the one in this pic:
&gt;http://abacus.sj.ipixmedia_dot_com/abc/M28/2add796ce50aa774eb660e1ea6/i-1.JPG

Congrats!  That's an &quot;add-a-room&quot; or what I call a &quot;drive-away&quot; tent.  Probably the most common true Westfalia tent.

&gt;What year or years was it originally sold for?

68 up breadloaves.  Not sure when they stopped making them.  Couple of minor variations depending on year.  Sometimes the YOM is stamped on the tent floor.

&gt;Will I have any trouble using it with my '66 Westy?

Shouldn't.  Clip to gutter, hook boot to jack points, and stretch out the front and rear of the boot &amp; stake.  I need to try mine out on the 65, which currently has a 
&quot;foyer&quot; tent.

Complete info (such as I've been able to gather) including parts photos and setup info at http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html.
