NQ, have you ever looked at the pictures of my buses? www.yourvw_dot_com/ronnie
a lot of ruff items, see the swap panel, lettered up, real funky wheelwells,
dents etc. I drove this bus for 3 years, to shows, campouts and as my daily
driver, the drivetrain was perfect but the body left a lot to be desired,
look at the double cab ruff ruff ruff, never did do this one, if you saw my
single cab, even worse, used a chain to pull the front end out, than a
gallon of bondo to finish it out, my double door has Flintstone passenger
front floors, the bottoms of the cargo doors have a little of the frames
left, body work, done and painted in a week, drive train perfect, everything
else so so, I'm proud of this bus, it has been to numerous shows and I have
put 24,000 miles on it in a year and has not been washed since finished
(it's getting it's first wash job for the classic this year) 365 days
between wash's. I sold my 64 Westy because it was way to nice and straight
for me (now owned by WCM). My new to me 1959 single cab will also be for
sale, as it again is to perfect and straight for me, I use and abuse my
buses, aren't that what there for. Now my 55 Barndoor Delux, rusty, beat?
but complete, I'll do a new drive train and drive it, leave the rust for
looks, compete against Richard (aka Rustybus) at the shows and enjoy it.
Moral of this story, don't give up, drive it enjoy it and come to Buses by
the Bridge 2001 in January (in your bus) so we all can meet you.

ronnie (long winded) bus driver

ps. all buses are sold except for the double door which isn't for sale,
that's why the ridiculous price.

Tonight I was working on the bus a little bit when stark reality hit home.
My bus looks like crap.
