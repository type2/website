Gene,

Front ends can be a bit tricky and sensitive. Dont' drive on those new
bushings unless they have some grease in them. I assume you greased them
during assembly. Use new zerk fittings that work. Make sure the bushing
holes are lined up for the zerks.  If this is the bus that got hit, be
sure that your front end components are not bent in any way. All the
angles are critical to a smooth straight ride. Are your tires even and
equally worn? Make sure both tie rods are the proper length, plus your
drag link should be proper length for a centered steering wheel. Lots of
details!
