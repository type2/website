Subject: RE: [VB] dim headlights/voltage ?'s

&gt;First I got a double ended spade connector and hooked it up between the
&gt;white/black wire and the yellow one at the dimmer. Tester at headlight:
&gt;Before: 4.6 volts after: 4.95 volts
&gt;
&gt;This appears to indicate a drop of ~.35 volts in the dimmer. not great
&gt;but maybe acceptable.

Bosch suggests that an overall drop of 0.6 V to the headlights on a 12 V
system is acceptable.  I'd guess that 0.3 V would be acceptable on a 6 V
system, but I'd try to minimize the drop as much as possible.  If
everything else was in top shape, that 0.35 V drop at the dimmer switch
is good for a 17%+ hit in light output at the headlights.

&gt;Next I tried your tests as followed...pulled out far right fuse-it was
&gt;a 16 amp fuse, and red.

It should be white, but OK for now.

&gt;Turn headlight on low. Measured battery voltage at battery terminals-
&gt;6.15 volts. Next I measured at one of the fuse clips, top clip was zero,
&gt;and the bottom clip 5.93 volts.

You're losing 0.22 V from the battery to the fuse box.  Not super,
but that might be as good as it gets.

&gt;Next I checked the voltage between terminal 30(fat red wire) and the far
&gt;right fuse. Here I got a reading of .26 volts.

You're losing 0.26 V from the fuse box to the light switch.  This
can probably be improved and may be the reason for the warm wires at
the back of the headlight switch.
 
&gt;Next between the terminal 56 (black and white wire),Here I got a reading
&gt;of .35 volts.

You're only losing about 0.09 V in the headlight switch itself, which
is pretty good.

&gt;Next I moved the black tester over to the far left fuse....here I get
&gt;1.01 volts. This is the largest culprit I beleive.

Right.  This means you're losing 0.66 V in the dimmer switch wiring.
I am assuming this is still with the spade connector hooked up instead
of the dimmer switch.  If this is with the dimmer switch hooked up,
you're losing about 0.35 V in the dimmer switch and about 0.31 V in
the wiring.  Either way, this is a big chunk.

To sum up these tests:

+6.15 V  battery voltage
-0.22 V  drop from battery to fuse box
-0.26 V  drop from fuse box to light switch
-0.09 V  drop inside light switch
-0.66 V  drop from light switch to dimmer switch to fuse box
-----
+4.92 V  which is almost exactly what you measured at the headlights.

&gt;I imagine it is the wiring between the headlight switch and the dimmer 
&gt;or between the dimmer and the fuse box.

I agree.  If I had to guess I'd say it's the white/black stripe wire
from the headlight switch to the dimmer.  It could also be the other
two wires coming from the dimmer, though.

&gt;Is there any way to get more slack out of the wires goin to the 
&gt;headlight switch, I can barely get at those wires or connectors...

Not sure.  The wires go behind the parcel shelf and down behind the
fuse box.  You might take down the front panels in the Bus (around
the back of the headlights) and see if you can wiggle the bundle of
wires around the fuse box to get some more slack.

&gt;thanks for all your help.

You're welcome!

Matt Roberds
