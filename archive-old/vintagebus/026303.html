&gt; &gt;How much are rides??
&gt; 
&gt; This is something I've often thought of doing.  Go to an event where people
&gt; have to walk quite a ways from the parking area to the event.  Cruise around
&gt; in your bus or bug with a sign that says, &quot;Rides $1.00 ea.&quot;  Might not make
&gt; a killing at it but you'd meet a lot of people and see a lot of smiling
&gt; faces. :-)
&gt; 

When I was in Madison Wisconsin for a while in the mid-90's I took my 65
Kombi to Camp Randall Stadium ( Home of the Wisconsin Badgers! Go Bucky
in the Rose Bowl!) for the Rolling Stones concert. I had some big paper
lips on the side, and was just going to cruise for the hallibut, but I
got repeated offers from groups of people to shuttle for $5 or $10. 
Luckily I had good seating in the back at the time, a full bay bus
middle seat set backward to be a rear-facing seat and a good rear seat,
and a bench between them for sitting sideways...At one point I had 11
passengers in the bus....all decked out in concert-going regalia...

I didn't see the Stones, but I had a bit of mad money for after-show
parties.... The only down side was that many of the &quot;chicks&quot; in the
groups of folks I was shuttling had on some nasty perfume, and my bus
smelled like a bordello for a week after.
