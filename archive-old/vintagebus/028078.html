&gt;   I get the feeling - I can't verify this - that the money received to
&gt; cover orders went to fund the move, divorce, kid problems, etc, 

If you can't verify it, then you probably shouldn't bring it up in this
forum. 

Business is business, and personal is personal, and Dawn's problems
have, unfortunately, been quite public. Her problems aren't an excuse,
but I find it ironic that all has been quiet (at least over on our side
of the street) for months about Dawn, and then this week someone posted
positive feedback about her. And now she's getting slammed. Doesn't seem
fair, does it?
