Hi Ronnie and the list. I found the best bus I've ever had in Oakland Ca. How 
far would you go for your dream bus? I drove from Albuquerque to Oakland 
(1100 miles one way) to pick up an all original 1962 Double door (215) 
WALKthru(080) Panel that is one of the nicest panels I've ever seen. This is 
my permanent bus and I will drive it to every show this summer. just wait 
man. The cargo bed is like brand new. No body metal replacement needed 
anywhere on this beautiful panel that I've fallen head over heals for. You 
gotta see it since I've cleaned all the moss and pollution off the paint. the 
bus sat under a rain gutter for 10 years and shows no signs of serious rust 
pillage. Incredible!! 
You gotta see it to believe it. I'll post pictures to a page and get back to 
the list with the address.
Kerry Cooper
