while i'm waiting for the flex brake hose to come....

time to sort another problem...
recent thread has given me a foot up the but to do this.

on the '60, i have the pull knob for hte reserve fuel..... no cable, no bits
to do anything with yet...

but i also have a gauge -- did buses sometimes have both, i'd have thought
one or the other... spose it must be a change over year.

actually 62 was the first year for the gas guage as standard, though you
could have had a rare optional extra bus, or someone retrofit it buy cutting
a hole in the dash and swapping gas tank over.    Do you have the stock (10
gal) or later (15gal) tank?  Just as you have that later beam- the truck I
had with the later beam had a later tank installed w/ gas guage - all jury
rigged.

the wiring has all been replaced - after fire!

but no go with the gauge...
so, i've looked at the top of the sender and theres only one wire - fitted
to the terminal on centre of sender and running to the gauge.
- - - -
right- there is a wire from the one push on connector on the sender up to the
guage  Then a ground wire goes to one (pick your favorite) of the screws
holding the sender to the tank- attach the other end to the body of bus.
......
btw, the thread of leaky cap...  without petrol gauge i overfill the tank,
basically i guess how much petrol i need, often putting in too much, which
means petrol slops up the neck. and out through top...
- - - --
I don't understand this slopping gas around stuff.      Anyway being and anal
retentive virgo I keep a record of when i fill up the tank.- keep a running
record of milage, useful for seeing how long you can go on a tank I got into
thehabit from driving a pre gas guage bus.      More accurate than a guage.
Guage on my bug changes,  used to have more miles on reserve,  tricky.
oops, it's raining and I need to adjust my valves.   I've only had it ooze
out when I parked with that side of the bus tilting downhill soon after
filling the tank.
