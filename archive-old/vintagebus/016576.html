This subject comes up every now and then.  Here's my take - this and
$3.50 will get you a steaming hot triple-shot mocha.

Argument one:
The number of buses in existence is a finite quality.  Every time
some soccer mom in an SUV (yes, I used that term again!) smacks into
one, there's one less to go around.   I'd really rather that wasn't
my bus.

Argument two:
Surface street and freeway traffic is increasing at an exponential rate,
and travel speeds are increasing as well.  It is becoming more and more
dangerous to drive our buses, &quot;competing&quot; against faster, bigger,
heavier cars/trucks, and less attentive drivers.  See Argument One.

Argument three:
Parts aren't getting any cheaper or easier to come by.  1600 stuff is
still easy to get, but the quality is declining.  The pool of NOS parts to pick from isn't getting any larger.  I'm noticing that mechanical restorations
are becoming more and more difficult and expensive as the buses rack
up more wear.  Anyone try to get king and link pin kits lately?  How
about for barndoor?  A steering box?  Think again - I've been trying
since before KP.

I built my '60 to be a driver: 12v, tall tires, 1600sp, and all new
mechanical bits.  I drive it around town a lot, and to work. If 
someone crashed into it, it would be fairly easy to replace.  The '55 
or '54 wouldn't be so easy to replace.  

It seems that the people who make the most noise about people not
driving buses (I'm not pointing fingers here!) also seem to be the
people who have the least amount of cash recently invested in them.
I'm not saying that buses are supposed to be an inventment, but when
you pour $9k and a zillion hours of labor into a car, you also tend
to be a little more judicious in it's use.

Now, as to the guy in Sacramento with the really nice '54 standard
who drives a vangon to the local shows, well, I can't speak to that...
