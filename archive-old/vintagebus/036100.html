 &quot;06  4
&gt;&quot; (meaning, supposedly, April of 64),

oooops - should read JUNE, 64.

nope,- day then month- as in 6th ofApril.

my truck's m-plate: while the numerals on the upper left are stamped &quot;06  4
&quot; (meaning, supposedly, April of 64), the id # is xx5148182, and Vw sent me
a birth certificate reading MAY 5-11 of 65. We best guessed that Hans had
slipped up at the end of a long day stamping plates, and had put a 4
instead of 5 in the year spot. OR Siftung was wrong!

well, that looks like an 6 April 65  bus to me - with the 9 digit vin the 
third number is the YOM,  okay.

  Don't understand though the may 5-11 bit, thoughthe called its last day the 
production date, and that it would be april 65.  

they dropped the year off the date line at some point- either for 64 or 65 
model year.  definately 65s did not have it- the date line reads DAY then 
MONTH.
