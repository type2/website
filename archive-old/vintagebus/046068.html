hello

My left reduction box is covered in oil so i believe it has a bad gasget or
something. i have to take it apart but i have no manual, so i was wondering
if anyone had some experience in this matter. If you do, could you please
give me some directions and tell me what to watch out for.

if it is leaking into the brake drum, soaking the shoes, it is likely the 
axle seal has gobe bad.   This is not expensive, though you should repace 
your soaked shoes.     There are instructions in John Muir Idiot Book, which 
has been in print since 1969, and is available in many places, including used 
bookshops.  A bentley reprint is also good, though pricier.  the Muir book is 
written for the non mechanic, and has many sensible tips, in spite of some 
confusions and inaccuracies.  definately get one.   You do not have to take 
the boxes apart to change the seal, but you do have to take the drums and the 
brakes off.   your bus is a 59?  if you have the 36mm axle nut there is no 
pug on the center side of the box- this plug o the 64-67 boxes can leak, they 
you have gear oil on the spring plate, but not inside the drum.  also, doe it 
smell icky like gear oil?   brake fluid can leak there too.
