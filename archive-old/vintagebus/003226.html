Subject: Dangerous Brakes!

  Hi Everyone,
 I'm asking for your assistance.  Have you or someone you know, had a=20
brake failure, including any of these, wheel cylinder, master cylinder, =
soft=20
hose or metal line on a VW that only has a single circuit master =
cylinder? =20
Please respond to the list as we all need to know the facts.
 My wife and I suffered a blown left rear wheel cylinder while returning =

from Jerome last weekend.  We had just emerged from the Mingus Mountain=20
road which is a 'white' knuckle road to begin with and were driving at =
45 MPH,
I had to slow down so I was on the brakes firmly and pow, to the floor =
goes the
pedal, the parking brake was not going to stop us in time and we avoided =

hitting the bus in front of us by inches by swerving off the road, just =
missing blockades
along the road.  Fate was with us at that moment.
 I have been driving old VWs for 15 years and this was my first failure =
of brakes.
All the brake equipment was replaced just one year ago with Varga parts. =
 This
event could easily have killed myself and wife, please respond with any =
info.
  Thankyou,
    Lou &amp; Liz in Havasu
