Subject: Shift rod bushes

When fitting the bushes that are like shuttle cocks, should I fit only the rear bush, insert the rod into the tube and slide it far enough forward to fit the front bush from the front, or should I fit both and squash the front bush by hand so that it goes into the shift rod tube?

Is it okay to just grease the rod and the bushes and fit it, or should I put something else into the tube to prevent rust and keep shifting slick?

Thanks
Paul
