Subject: Time to get started!

Hi there,
    New to the group....will mostly be lurking for a while, going through
the archives etc...I bought a 67 13 window deluxe bus a year ago, and I have
got all the wiring mostly straighten out etc. Taking it on a trip to boise
to get an estimate for getting all of my rust areas fixed. It's been an
Idaho bus for most his life so it's not nearly as rusty as some that I've
seen. Looking forward to sharing it with you all....
