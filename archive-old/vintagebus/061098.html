Subject: gear poppin' 

My '60 bus has always popped out of 4th occasionaly.
So yesterday I re-assembled my shifter, after having
it apart for a while. when i first went for a test
drive, i couldn't even find reverse, so I loosened the
bolts at the base of the shifter, and wiggled it
around a bit until i could find the gear. During the
test drive I noticed that it popped horribly out of
2nd and 4th. So I parked, and moved the shifter
forward a bit, and tightened it back down. There was
an improvement, but not completely. I've moved it up
about as far is it goes, but i'm still popping out of
4th a bit. Is there some other adjustment I can make?
Perhaps at the rear shift-rod coupler? How does one
make this adjustment? thanks for any help,
-russ henry
