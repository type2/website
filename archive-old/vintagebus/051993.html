Hey Everybody,
I've been lurking and thought I'd say &quot;Hi&quot;. I've had a '66 VW bus for over 25 
years now. I'm the third owner, bought it for $1000. My daughter christened 
it Butterfly the Bus.  http://www.geocities_dot_com/alicestrong/butterfly2.jpg  
My little bus has seen alot of miles, campgrounds, several paint jobs, a 
couple of wrecks, and was even stolen ( I got it back after 2 months). 
Unfortunately, my bus has never been as nice as when I first bought it, 
especially since the #!%*&amp;!! guys who stole it really trashed it. I've always 
said that one day I would restore it. So, here I am. I'd like to do some of 
it myself, bit by bit. It is pretty sound mechanically, but needs cosmetics. 
I've neglected to replace the rubber when I should have, so it has a little 
floorboard and windshield rust, etc. The interior is fairly shot ( needs a 
headliner badly). Can anyone recommend a  good book or other starting place? 
I have the Idiot book and a shop-type manual ( not the original VW one...that 
disappeared when the bus was stolen.....yes, I had the factory manual...boo 
hoo)  I'd like a sort of &quot;step by step&quot; type restoration guide, like the one 
VW Trends makes for bugs. Is there such a book?
Thanks....Alice
