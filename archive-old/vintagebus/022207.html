My #1 problem with kustom buses?  Execution.  Yes, it's one thing to use
all the correctly modified parts so it's a bolt on conversion.  But taking
a look around and seeing all the lowered buses around here, 90% of them
have 2 or 3 leaves pulled out of the front beam.  Then for that stinger
exhaust?  The notch the apron. Etc.  And it's not like they're taking a
nice original paint bus and simply lowering it.  THat I could almost take.
I can't count the number of original paint buses that instantly went to the
primer state, never to return to paint again.

There are a few examples of lowered buses that I *like* - like Rikki James'
RHD deluxe done up like herbie.  It's all a matter of execution.
