Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

Word. Thom is dead on. What size are the bolts that
hold that pan on to the bus? I have the pan but the
bolts are MIA?

&gt; to replace the
&gt; floor pans and rockers and whatnot.
&gt; 
&gt; The passenger side floor section took me between 2
&gt; and 2.5 hours to replace
&gt; on the '60.
&gt; 
&gt; Also - do you have the pedal pan on your bus?  It
&gt; makes a *huge* difference
&gt; in draft reduction!
&gt; 
&gt; Although I haven't done it on this bus yet, I found
&gt; that replacing the
&gt; factory heater tube wrap with foam pipe insulation,
&gt; as well as insulating
&gt; the curved sections fore and aft that are not
&gt; normally insulated, helped
&gt; considerably with heat.
