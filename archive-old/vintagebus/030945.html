Since I have so much free time (yeah right!) and can't seem to leave
well enough
alone I am contemplating putting a 5 speed trans into one of my Buses.
Probably a
Porsche unit. I'm not worried about it &quot;spinning backwards&quot; as I'll most
likely get
rid of the reduction boxes anyway. What I would like is any info / input
from
someone who has done this, or something similar and can give me some
pointers. I'm
guessing a 914, 912, or early 911 trans would do the trick, but what
about axles,
mounts, brakes, etc.....

Thanks in advance,
Greg
