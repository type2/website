Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone try to buy BRM's from a guy in Romania

The retard emailed me back confirming he was going to use UPS!  Right there
I caught him...I'm waiting for his comeback.. So far he has'nt replied after
I told him that I was going to expose him to EBay and the VW community..

If anyone wants to know what name he uses on ebay and his email just reply
directly to me... Unless it's cool to post the info...
