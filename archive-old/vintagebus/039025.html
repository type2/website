Subject: Siezed? engine - to hope or not to hope

&gt;My engine appeared seized the other day
&gt;Today, took the heads/cylinders off, and then bumped the flywheel, 
&gt;everything moves. No noises, no metal shavings in oil,
&gt;Should I just put it back together and hope?
&lt;snipped for content&gt;

When I put my fresh 1776 together and stuck it in my 58 single cab, it had a
problem.  There was a very load banging sound in it!  Happened at the same
point on the engine when turning it by hand.  Not good.  So out it came.
Put it on the stand and turned it again.  Same thing.  Once every
revolution, I'd feel a slight drag while turning it and then BANG.  

So I pulled off the rocker assemblies on both sides and turned it again.
Silence!  (Not to mention extreme surprise and relief.)  So I put the rocker
assemblies back on and checked it again and it has worked fine ever since.
I never did figure out what it was.  

I wish I had paid more attention while removing the rocker assemblies -
something must have been amiss, but I missed it.  This isn't really advice,
just a possibly-related story.
