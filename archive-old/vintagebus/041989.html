&gt; Just thinking...
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever made a gas tank? I was looking at the area for the 
&gt; gas tank for my '59 SC. As you know, you get to it from the storage 
&gt; area under the bed. When the gas tank is in place, there are some 
&gt; panels that keep you from seeing it. So I was thinking about making a 
&gt; gas tank to TOTALLY fill the area where it is supposed to be 
&gt; installed. Seems like I could get a pretty big more square tank in 
&gt; there that would hold more gas.

Building a gas tank isn't all that hard.  It's just a big welded box with
a few accessories.  You should include a couple of baffles to reduce slosh
and to strengthen the tank.  The outlet should have a bit of a sump so
that the outlet won't come uncovered if the tank is tilted for a bit.  You
also need to provide a filler neck and vent arrangement similar to the
original tank.

The easiest way to figure out the correct dimensions is to make a mockup
out of cardboard.  Be sure that the tank can be installed and removed with
at least a half-inch clearance, as the finished tank will tend to be
bigger than the mockup, due to Murphy's law.

Remember that it is easer to make a bend than a long butt weld.  A good
design will have only one long weld down its length.  Plan on about an
inch radius on the bends for ease of bending and strength.

After the tank is complete, seal it up, then pressurize it by blowing into
a vent tube by mouth only.  Seal the tube and wait a day.  Pressure still
the same?  If so, you have a winner. If not, time for soapsuds!

Have fun!
