I received this from someone at &quot;Volktalk&quot; after sending them a message about the practices of taking down web sites having almost anything to do with v-w...Canned response, but interesting that I received any response at all.

Interesting that I did not &quot;request&quot; anything.  I was just letting them know I was disapointed about their policy of taking down all websites using volkswagen or vw in their name.
