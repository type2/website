Subject: trade 54 bug for a splitty? - LA CA
Message-ID: &lt;0_dot_ca2134fc.2537da8a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

This guys address is Rhunes29_at_aol_dot_com.  Please respond to him not me:

I don't know how to send a message to everybody, just respond. So if you can 
send this to everyone on the list, I would be very grateful...

...While searching in local newspapers and online for a type 2, I found a '54 
bug for sale in Benicia, CA (bay area). I live in LA County (So Cal). The 
price was so good for the '54 that I drove 7 hours each way and towed it 
home. (WHAT WAS I THINKING) Within a month, I lost interest in it because I 
really wanted a type 2. The reason the price was so good was because it is a p
roject!  I am a full time student and don't have the time or money to work on 
it. It isn't that I don't enjoy working on it, but I am tired of 
bugs...Anyway, why I wanted this posted is to see if anyone on the list might 
know of anybody who is actually willing to trade a pre-'67 type 2 for a '54 
bug. I am not looking for a show winner, but I just want a type 2 that I can 
drive around. If anything I want one that is in pretty bad shape so that I 
can work on it. I am looking for a little more than a rolling shell. If 
anyone knows of anybody, this is a list of what it basically is:
~1954 LHD bug
~has batwing steering wheel
~has all original seats
~dash never cut
~semaphores (bought from am man in Germany)
~original tank, I bought a 100 mm cap for it
~W decklid
~new running boards, all interior knobs, hood crest and emblem
~new pre-'55 door rubber
~stock ignition (hard to find, bought from a friend who got it at Bad 
Campberg) 

I think the reason I have had such a hard time trading it is because most 
people who own type 2 's seem to hate bugs. I like both, but would prefer a 
bus. I am probably going to take it to Pomona this Sunday for the Corvette 
Swap Meet (5 minutes from my house). If anyone could help, I would love to 
hear from you. I don't really want to sell, because I would probably use the 
money for other things like paying off debts. Who cares about debt if you 
have an old VW bus sitting in your driveway!!!  :-)
