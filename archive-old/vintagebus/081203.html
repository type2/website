Subject: Need a clue on a problem - redux box

I need a little help with finding a problem with a reduction box, if all
you bus geniuses can lend a little.

Driving last Friday night about 11:30 pm, Im on the I-20 eastbound
headed to North Carolina from Alabama. Im doing about 68-70 for about
15 or 20 minutes or so.  As Im coming into Villa Rica, I begin to feel
a little vibration in the wheel, but its coming from the rear and it
seems to be on the right rear.  It kinda causes the speed to drop off a
touch and it seems like it is beginning to strain a little to keep the
pace.

So I pull of at the Douglasville exit and pull into a vacant parking lot
to check whats up.  I look at the right rear reduction box and it is
dripping 140 weight, not a lot but a drop every 30 seconds or so. I say
to heck with it and turn around back to the farm.  But I dont go so
fast, like maybe 45 or 50 tops.  At this speed I dont feel any
vibration.  And when I check the next morning, the dripping stopped.

My question is 

Do I have a bad seal that might be twisting at the higher speed, is it a
bearing that is going bad and only sets up the vibration at higher
speeds?  What is going on here?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Oh one thing I forgot  In the preparation tuneup the days before the
start of the trip, I had to add about 1 and = ounces 140 weight to the
same box.  And the inside of the mag was a little oily.

Thanks in advance.
