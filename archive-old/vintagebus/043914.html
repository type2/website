I have my roots in Hot Rods (over 30 years of customizing), 19 years doing
the same thing to Harleys and 28 years since the purchase of my first VW.
I've seen the mentality of &quot;My way is the right way&quot; in each of the above
categories.  I don't know if it's an insecurity that stems from lack of
self confidence in the individuals finished product (their VW or whatever)
or a simple narrow mindedness.
Thank goodness for the people with insights to do things differently, for
whatever reason.  I for one believe in Live and let Live or To Each His
Own.  It's not too hard for me to relate to the hard work that goes into
all types of construction and to be able to pay a respectable &quot;Job well
done&quot; compliment to the builder!
