Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance

Both my VW's are insured by Allstate.  It's the same insurance we have on
all 7 of our cars (only two of which are VW's).

'60 European Beetle
'67 Deluxe Bus


&gt; Howdy all,
&gt;
&gt; It's insurance renewal time at my house and I was wondering what
suggestions
&gt; any of y'all may have regarding insurance for my '66 13 window Deluxe.  We
&gt; are currently using State farm, but I was wondering if any of you have or
&gt; are using one of the vintage car insurers.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
