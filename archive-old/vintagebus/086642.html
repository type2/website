Subject: Re: [VB] bug fenders

I agree with Clara (hi Clara!), these are OS2.  At Airhead Parts in Ventura,
CA ( http://airheadparts_dot_com ), they have their fender boxes custom made, so
they are sized just right, but they're still OS2 for UPS or FEDEX.  Keep in
mind that with their boxes and the typical fender shaping, you may only pack
one FRONT fender per box, but can pack 2 REAR fenders in one box.

I really can't see how any savings will be made by putting them on a plane
as oversized luggage.

&gt; You can check them onto a plane, but they are probably oversized as
&gt; luggage,
&gt; and would cost $25 extra to do that.
&gt;
&gt; I have found I can get large cardboard boxes from behind furniture stores.
&gt; Fedex is good on shipping, and there is one at every Kinko's these days.
&gt; Might cost about $40 to ship fenders to the east coast.   I have shipped
&gt; fenders before, they are 2nd oversize, which means they go at the 30lb
&gt; rate even
&gt; if they weigh less.  Cost $30 or $25 to ship them to CA from WA.
&gt;
&gt; Fedx will drop them at the door, so your friend doesn't have to haul the
&gt; big
&gt; box around.
&gt;
&gt; You could also try Greyhound Package Express for shpping large
&gt; objects.  It
&gt; would have to be dropped off and picked up at the Greyhound Bus Station.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps.

&gt; &lt;&lt; This is a like math word problem., but with vw parts involved.
&gt;
&gt; I recently got a bug from my friend Kate. It needs new fenders, and
&gt; another
&gt; friend has them. They are in California. A third friend-Laura is flying
&gt; from
&gt; San Francisco to Boston next week, and offered to take the fenders with
&gt; her.
&gt;
&gt; How practical is this? Ie can you check fenders onto a plane? How much
&gt; extra
&gt; would it cost? Has anyone ever done this? Is it worth the hassle, and
&gt; would
&gt; the fenders survive the trip intact?
