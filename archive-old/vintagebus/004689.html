&gt;i dont believe they have o rings.  the square cover plate with the tube

Yeah, I found this out.  My bad...
&gt;about the shim gaskets.  they should be stuck on.  this is good, don't peel
&gt;them off, if you unstick them you better be so anal retentive about having
&gt;them clean and lined up or the box will leak.

My box had no gaskets - just sealant.  I checked, ran the plate through the
wire wheel, looked and looked again - nothing.  So I just put in a thin
paper gasket for sealing.  I've got the box stored upright so I'll check it
in the morning to see if it leaked anything.

Thanks for the advice Clara.  I'm trying 80w90 gear oil for now as per
Ronnie's suggestion.  The old stuff stank and was dark - more from age than
anything else.  I filled up the box once, worked the guts, drained it, and
refilled.  The stuff that came out was kind of streaky looking.  I think I'm
all good to go now.  Later!
