Subject: RE: [VB] new aftermarket crankshaft pulley/test fit results

  I just went out to the shop and tried to install the oversize pulley on a
stock 1600, here's what I found
1. When pulley is fully installed it hits the back of the crank pulley tin
where it rises in the rear.
2. The side tabs will need to be trimmed in order to clear the outside of
the pulley.
3. The breast plate will need to be trimmed extensively to clear the pulley
4. In order to install a belt you either would need to 1. remove pulley to
install belt, or 2. trim total bottom of pulley tin off in order to
replace/install belt.
5. From my fitting I have come to the conclusion that this is an item meant
for the people that love to read magazines and take there advice as gospel. 
This would be good for a high torque engine that runs at low RPM's to help
speed up the fan for better cooling at low RPM's
6. Not worth the time or trouble on a bus engine
7. Spend your money on a type 3 tight finned doghouse oil cooler

&quot;cannot see how it would clear the tin&quot;

I believe the article said one would need to modify the tin in order to fit 
the new pulley.
