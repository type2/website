Subject: Re: [VB] Need sheet metal for '65

I tried to get some info on lead as a filler at my local welding 
shop. They no longer stock it but said that most people are using a J 
&amp; B Weld type of epoxy to fill in the pits. I am giving it a try as 
well. I would suspect that it will have good long term results as I 
have used it on many other projects. (...)

&gt;I'm finally moving the 21w project along. I thought the clips I had 
&gt;were ok, but now need a left rear corner piece from a donor.
&gt;The English cargo floors seem to be unavailable through the usual 
&gt;channels, so if anyone has a set they don't need, let me know.
&gt;
&gt;The '66 Riviera is rolling on new front bearings and stopping with 
&gt;new brake shoes and cyls. They were competely gunked up with fluid 
&gt;and dust, the drums had rust pits because the shoes weren't hitting 
&gt;'em. Guess that's better than grooves. It's a miracle that the nose 
&gt;is unhit, but may explain the fallover damage at the roofline and 
&gt;drivers door.  Next step is some hole and pit filling in the lower 
&gt;windshield channel. A neighbor mentioned lead as a filler. Anybody 
&gt;use this? I was going to use the thick POR15 from the tube.
