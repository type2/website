&gt;I am looking for something that will generate a stream of smoke (or smoke
&gt;like particles) for testing air flow.  [...] I have an air leak SOMEWHERE
&gt;on the 70's 1600,

Fourth of July smoke bomb, put in a tin can, with some fuel line attached
to direct the smoke where you want?

Use a piece of fuel line like a stethoscope?  Put one end at your ear
and point the other end at the carb base, intake manifold flanges, etc.

WARNING: I don't know if this would work or be a bad idea for some other
reason, but...

1) shut off engine
2) remove air cleaner
3) block off carb inlet (tinfoil/plastic and rubber band? I don't know)
4) pressurize system:
    4.1) put compression tester in one spark plug hole and pressurize
         to a few pounds (not very much or you will spin the engine)
    4.2) put a cork in the tailpipe and pressurize with a hand tire
         pump
5) listen/feel for hissing (easier without engine noise).

Just some ideas.
