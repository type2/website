Subject: [VB] Jerome raffle bus update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was at the site of the Raffle bus today and got to
drive it! Definitely a decent driver. Brakes will
certainly put you through the windscreen if you dont
hang on! Looked great to me and some last minute final
touches are yet to be put into place. It has my $0.50
for raffle tickets! 
See you all next weekend at Jerome! =)
