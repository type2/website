Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Turn signal switch for my 67

9 prong blinker box is under the kick panel in front of drivers feet.

the first urls show  an earlier bus- see the pointy speedo pod corners- is 
april 11 61 or earlier.   
in the 64 pic the speedo pod corners are rounded.  has BigRedLight on dash to 
left of speedo.

a 67 has no BRL,  has rounded pod, and has a larger radio hole than the 55-66 
buses.

 &gt;Where would the 9-prong box be mounted?
 
 Here's a shot of a bare dash from the left:
