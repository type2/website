Something that has bugged me since I got into VWs several years back and 
started going to shows has been, why do they let trailer queens compete with 
the every day Joe restoration. I guess it didnt bother me until a couple 
years ago I was staying at a motel and in came a very nice inclosed trailer. 
The folk around me said it was such-and-such from the NE. I guess he just 
travels around with this car in the trailer to shows and never even fires it 
up. They were all debating on if  it would even run or had guts in the 
engine.

WHat got me was, there is no way in hell I could ever compete with someone 
like this since he had some major sponsers. He didnt care how much it cost 
or where it came from as long as it was perfect.

When I was big into Studebakers, you would win your class, but then you went 
to a seniors division and competed with other trailer queens and such. WHY 
doesnt VW do something like this. It would be more fair to the average 
person and I THINK that the majority of folks on this list. I know there are 
folks on here that have no problem dropping several grand on a car, but 
there are others that have trouble with a few hundred.

Just something thats always bugged the hell out of me and I guess why Im not 
that interested in competing. I KNOW there is gonna be someone that comes 
with something better than I can afford.

&gt;Most of the foo foo shows all these people are at anyway, Classic,
&gt;Barf-o-Rama's, but in my opinion again, I think that at OCTO (pre
&gt;Classic),would be the place to hold the First Annual Type 2 Concours, the
&gt;buses are there, the people are there, the need is there and a more then
&gt;qualified panel of Judges is also present, more then just the fab 5, the
&gt;magazines are there and a lot of big budget buyers who would pay ungodly
&gt;amounts of money to own a concours certified winner.
&gt;
&gt;ps. plus the pre Classic OCTO is Split buses only. no other bus or VW
&gt;product is allowed in.

&gt;
&gt;So now that we've found the finest, are we going to fly the Fab Five to
&gt;all the festivities?  That should be fun, but who will fund it?
