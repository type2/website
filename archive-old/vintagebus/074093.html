Hey all,

I've noticed a consistent, but unusual problem in my '67 Riviera.  I'm 
running a new, stock 1600SP with a 30-PICT carb.  When I've gone up into 
the Santa Cruz Mountains for a drive, sometimes I need to pull over and let 
traffic by.  When I'm going uphill or on flat ground, no problems to speak of.

But when I'm headed downhill and have been using the gearbox and the brakes 
to slow myself, and when I put the clutch in and take it out of gear, the 
engine dies.

The bus fires right back up again and I get going, but I just want to 
figure out what might be causing this.  It's caused me to turn back and 
head home a few times.

-Taylor
