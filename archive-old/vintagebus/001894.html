Subject: Engine rebuild - What would you do?

I'm finally starting to dig into the 65 I bought back in June to try to
decide how to proceed. When I did my 71 two years ago, it had a broken
crankshaft, and was pretty messed up, so I opted for a complete rebuild.  It
cost $1700 and has 12,000 miles on it now, and is running strong, and goes
everywhere.
    The 65 is different. The motor runs well, has good compression, and
starts right up every time.  The three problems with it are: high idle
1800rpm(dual Kadrons) that I've tried to mess with, but that's as low as I
can get it,  oil seems to be leaking everywhere, (but pressure guage still
shows 35 - 40) and it backfires due to rusted out exhaust (I believe).  I
know nothing about the history of this engine.  I don't have that kind of
money right now, but I do have time, and am fairly mechanical, although I've
never rebuilt an entire motor before.  This is by no means going to be a
show car, just a splittie project that I hope to get back on the road, to be
driven and appreciated.
    Also, I am signing up for an automotive repair basics class at a local
technical college for the fall, and was even thinking of maybe pulling the
motor to donate as a guinea pig, or lab specimen.

Question:  What would you do next if you were me?

Thanks
