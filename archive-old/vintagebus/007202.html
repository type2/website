&gt; &gt; &gt;I will be getting out the Muir book (and looking at the 'Rituals'
chapter)
&gt; &gt; &gt;today to see if I can exorcise the demons from the hubcap before I send
it
&gt; &gt; &gt;on it's way.   I saw aprocedure posted a couple of weeks ago about
using
&gt; &gt; &gt;candles and drawing a VW emblem with salt on the garage floor to remove
a
&gt; &gt; &gt;persistant gland nut.  Will this procedure also remove demons from a
&gt; &gt; &gt;hubcap??  The _LAST_ thing I want to do is pass the 'bad moe-joe'
along.
&gt;
I dont know what you guys did to that thing but it brought me nothing but
luck for 600+ miles.

I am wondering if somebody out there turned the horseshoe upside down and
ran all  the good luck out (or maybe _you_ used it all and didnt stop to
fill it back up)  &lt;&lt;g&gt;&gt;

over-budget project; not paying closer attention to the generator; at
rebuild time last summer).
