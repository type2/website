well, while trying to install our windows into the bus, the two that go into 
the rear side doors broke.  I'm assuming these are the same size as all the 
stationary windows.  for some reasom I could not get these two in, but all 
the others went in fine.

Does anyone in the portland area have any new stationary window glass that 
they are willing to give up??  Its for a 59 Kombi.  I wanted to check with 
the list before I go to Always VW.

Kim
