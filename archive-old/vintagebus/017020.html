Subject: Desperately need roof rack!

Hi, I'm leaving from here in Maryland to go on my annual cross country trip 
and I really need a full roof rack for all my stuff. My bus is a 67 hardtop 
westy. A decent to high quality vintage rack is preferred and I have up to 
600.00 to spend. I am willing to travel almost anywhere to get it as my 
plans on my trip are spur of the moment. Please help! I'm leaving thursday 
so let me know. Thanks, Sam
