Subject: Re: [VB] ambulance identification

Ivory was available on commercial type 2s from march 53 through 67.  not the most common colour, but yes, it was used on more than ambulances.

ambulances were type 27, which should be on the metal tag in the engine compartment 'typ27' 
If it says 'typ 23' it's a kombi.

they came with gas guages, and side windows frosted 3/4 of the way up, and jailbars, and fold down back hatches.  even if the overhead fans are gone, look for the wiring. oh, they came with a sliding glass partition between front and back, and some extra buttons for buzzers in the back.

&gt;  i finally bought this 1961 bus from a local vw guy.  i am &gt;wondering if it might have originally been an ambulance. 
&gt; the original color was ivory and it came with a clear &gt;needle speedo.  the overhead vent is missing/rotted out, so &gt;im guessing that somebody took the ambulance fans if it 
&gt;did in fact have them.  my question is, did all ambulances &gt;have the fold down rear hatch?  have some ideas on how to &gt;positively identify an ambulance without the m codes?  only &gt;ambulances were painted ivory, correct?
