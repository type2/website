Subject: RE: [VB] What parts should I choose? 

Get all the NUTS, BOLTS, WASHERS, SCREWS, little rubber seals, shift
rods, couplers, heater duct fabric, etc. etc.... strip the trans of all
the hardware... get it all and send it to me :-)


Other items that could be of use to some people would be the steering
box and all the rest of the running gear.

My friend is parting out a '67 bus and I've got first (and last) shot at
anything I need off of it: it's going to the crusher after I decide what
I
want.
 

Luckily, my bus is pretty straight, so there's not much I need, but I'd
like to pick up anything that is &quot;hard to find&quot; while I have a chance.
Unfortunately, I'm working on limited funds and don't have a place for a
third bus, otherwise I'd just snatch it up.  From what I recall this
parts
bus is in fairly reasonable shape (although not super) and is missing an
engine and tranny.
 

The main things I want off of it are the RGBs and the axle shafts.
Other
thoughts were the glass, door handles, steering box, and seats.  Is
there
other stuff that I should be sure to grab?
