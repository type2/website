&gt;Maybe consider that the chassis are stamped with the vin but the m code
&gt;plate isnt stamped until its ready to come off the line. Different options
&gt;take different time to complete and at 500 or so busses a day going thru
&gt;even a 2 day delay could account for a lot.

OK; then there's the mystery of the 65's mplate: the date stamped on it is

06  4

but the folks at VW sent back a note indicating that it was built and
shipped the week of May 5-11, 1965.
The rest of the tag (and the info VW sent me AND the production numbers)
say that VW is right, and the tag is 'wrong.'
I would guess that perhaps some chassis were set aside from the line for
some reason - flaws, tooling changes, etc - and while the body was assigned
a tag in April, it didn't go through the line until May.

What we need is a plant worker to write a memoir of how the lines worked!
Any of you German residents want to start a project :)
