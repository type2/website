&gt;  I just entered my 62 truck in Thom's registry.  I was surprised to see
&gt;  the color come back as Lotus white instead of pearl white.  Most of the
&gt;  11 other entries of the same year model and type came back the same
&gt;  color.  When did Pearl white start as a color?  Is there a significant
&gt;  difference between the two?  I can't say I've seen one next to the
&gt;  other.
&gt;  

I have been collecting bits of paint samples to make  some thing with the 
diff colours .  not together yet, but I have seven or so 'whites' that vw 
used on the buses, it can get a bit confusing.  Not sure if I have a sample 
of lotus white.   I am using the little grill on the rear of the overhead 
vent.   Of course, more difficult to find the lower color there,  but I was 
very happy to get an air vent block  (the squarish piece further forward) in 
Ruby Red.    For Mouse Grey, I have a gas door.

I was collecting the engine lid props in the different colours, but buses 
keep wanting them.
