Subject: RE: [VB] Silicone sump plate gaskets.

I have had a couple questions about this, so let me clarify me setup.

I installed one silicone gasket between the case and Berg 1.5qt deep sump.
No problem.  I then installed one gasket between the Berg sump and the sump
plate.  No problem.

For this engine I am not running the oil screen since it has full flow
oiling.  Also installed is a &quot;cow magnet&quot; attached to the sump oil pickup
tube.

From what I can tell the gaskets would be too thick if using an oil screen
with two gaskets and stock bolts.  In this scenario the sump plate bolts
would need to be extended.

Sorry for not being more elaborate in the first post.

Thanks,

Did you have to extend the studs? I started to install the silicone 
gaskets and found the the studs were too short. I didn't have the time 
to extend the studs so paper gaskets went back on the engine.

This is a follow up from a previous thread a few weeks ago about sump plate
gaskets.

 

I ordered up a pair of silicone gaskets that Eric suggested at
aircooled_dot_net.  They arrived yesterday and I popped them right on the motor.
