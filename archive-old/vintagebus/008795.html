My friend is putting a bus togetherm and we have been having trouble with
the wiring the alt. correctly. The motor is out of a 72 stupid beetle and it
is VW with external reg. It has 1 post for constant power and a 3 wire plug
that goes directly to the voltage regulator. With just this done the bus
won't die when the ignition is turned off. We spliced the blue wire from the
reg. into the blue wire off the gen.(going to the dash) The bus now shuts
off with the key but the dash light comes and goes. Is this incorrect, or do
we need to replace some parts? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
