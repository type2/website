&gt; I agree that LEDs won't work with reversed polarity.  Whether they

They're diodes, so they just block the current.

&gt; DON'T PUT LED REPLACEMENT &quot;BULBS&quot; IN YOUR EXTERIOR LIGHTS.

&gt; The reflectors that are on there now are designed to work with the
&gt; size, shape, and location of the filament in an incandescent lamp.  If
&gt; you install a replacement lamp made of clustered LEDs, you will
&gt; drastically REDUCE the total light output from the lamp/reflector/lens
&gt; assembly.  Guaranteed.

Thank you for that.  Too many folks have the &quot;by gawd, I spent $60 on
those replacement LED bulbs and they _have_ to be brighter than the
incandescents!&quot; attitude.  They really are dimmer, no matter how much one
wishes they were brighter!
