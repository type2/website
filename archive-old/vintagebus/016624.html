P...U... that smoke does smell pretty toxic. that just happened to me a 
couple weeks ago. i must have bent the hot connector a little and it was 
grounding out on the inside of the bucket. it fried the covering off the 
wire too! i covered it with elect. tape, ill wait till it smokes again till 
i pull that whole wire.
later,
