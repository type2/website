&lt;&lt; do i need a separate inverter for each device(definitely need to change 
what i
 will try to install) which inverter should i get, and do you have 
suggestions as to where to tap into the electrical system? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Probably best to at least have two inverters.  One for the gauges and one for 
your radio/accessories.  We would just wire each inverter with inline fuses 
off the main power wire on the right of the main fuse box.  Eric&amp;Barb
