&lt;&lt; Dear Eric &amp; Barb
 	Thank you for the info on the tranny ID#. Is there a way to connect
 this number to a date of manufacture. Is there a chart of dates and ID
 #s ? 
 	Thanks Your Friend Paul
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
There is a list of them in Progressive Refinements.  Which is a very hard too
get piece of literature since VW only issued one per dealership and they had
to be returned to VW when the dealership no longer need it.  If you want we
could try and figure out your tranny # if you want.  There is a chance that we
will not be able to help you.  Both the tranny and engine cases could be
bought from VW without ID numbers so the dealership could stamp the same
number from your old case into the new.  This was done due to some of the old
vehicle laws.  Some of which had to be the same as originally registered and
in some states the engine number was what tracked the vehicle.  Then again
sometimes repair shops just stamped number that they came up with off the top
of thier heads.        Keep On VWing,  Eric &amp; Barb
