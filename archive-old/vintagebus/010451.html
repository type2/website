Subject: Electric impact wrenches
Date: Wed, 30 Aug 2000 02:15:26 -0700

I'm interested in comments from anyone experienced with either a 110 Volt or
12 Volt electric impact wrench.

I have a small compressor that otherwise suits my infrequent needs, but
isn't powerful enough to drive an air impact wrench.  My use of such a
wrench would be so infrequent that I can't justify the expense of a
larger/newer compressor just to service an impact wrench.

Both COSTCO and Harbor Freight carry a 12 V impact wrench that claims to put
out up to 150 ft./lbs. torque, which would be adequate for lug nuts, etc.,
and the price is ~$40.00 to $50.00.

I've recently seen 110 V impact wrenches for ~$60.00 that claimed a capacity
in excess of 250 ft./lbs. of torque, marginally adequate for rear axle nuts.

I'm interested in real-world experience with such tools, especially in
reference to Type 2 applications.

Thanks for your time.....
