The problem with web-based periodcals?  You have to be glued to
the tube to read 'em.  After working 8-12 hours during the day
in front of one of these things, I kinda like reading stuff offline.
And no, printing it at home isn't really practical.

Also, who would fund the web site itself?  You guys forget that 
web space and bandwidth costs money.  I despise the &quot;free&quot; servers with 
all their annoying popups, banner ads, and tons of cookies.
