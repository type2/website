Volks,

A few may remember that I have mentioned that I was intending to 
rebuild my engine. It is a 1776 type 1 engine with dual Kadrons in a 
'72 bus.

Well the rebuild is complete, the engine is in the bus and I have 
about 40 miles on the new engine after two runs to town. I started it 
and ran it for the regulation 20 minutes to bed in the cam followers 
(as per the Tom Wilson's book) but not until I sorted out the timing 
problem caused by the distributor drive being out by a couple of 
teeth (I think). It's been to my mechanic, Ross, for a post 
rebuild check to make sure I haven't stuffed up too much more than 
the distributor timing (see below). 

After setting the timing (way too far advanced) and checking the 
valve adjustment (couple slightly tight, couple tightly loose - &quot;It's 
a matter of feel.&quot;) for me, Ross said: &quot;It's running a sweet as a 
nut.&quot;

I've enjoyed the task but it took about 3 weeks longer than I planned 
(working at it on weekends, at night, etc). I've previously finished 
off (carbies, tinware, etc) and installed a short engine built by 
Ross but this was the first complete ground up rebuild.  
It would have been quicker if I'd done it before and I didn't keep 
making dumb mistakes. 

I used the books by Tom Wilson and John Muir, but mainly Wilson. Muir 
was a sort of backup if I needed some extra explanation. Both books 
now sport lots of greasy fingerprints. I've also got the Bentley book 
but I only used the torque value table in it for the rebuild, 
everything else was in Wilson. I did my first remove, install, etc 
with only Muir and it was fine. Glad I had Wilson for the rebuild 
though. By the way, thanks to those who offered suggestions about how 
to get Wilson in Australia.

I went through 12 pairs of latex gloves ($2/box of 12 pair). First 
time I'd used them and they're good when your handling lots of dirty 
bits and pieces. They don't stand up though when you wear them while 
washing parts in kerosene.

The rebuild was necessary because when I stripped the engine 2 1/2 
years ago for a rebuild and conversion from 1600dp to 1776, I didn't 
undo that 13mm nut down low on the front RH side and couldn't get the 
case apart despite a BIG effort. After Ross removed the nut from the 
stud the case came apart easily, as it does. The result of my efforts 
was a crack in the crankcase. The crack wasn't discovered until after 
the initial rebuild was done and the engine installed. It was then 
filled with epoxy but still leaked oil when the engine was hot. 

As it turns out, when my son was using the bus for a few weeks he let 
the oil run down and the oil light &quot;Just came on a little bit Dad! 
I stopped straight away!&quot; Too late. The damage was done and the main 
and camshaft bearings showed signs of damage when I stripped the 
engine. Good thing I was planning a rebuild so his lack of attention 
to the dipstick level didn't cause any unplanned or extra expense.

My son now understands that VWs are different to 'normal' cars and 
the oil light doesn't just tell you when the oil level is low, like 
when it comes on when you go round a corner in some older cars. He is 
now aware that if the light comes on, it may be too late.

When I stripped the engine I also found a small piece of wet &amp; dry 
paper (don't know what you guys call it in other parts of the 
world) lodged at the top of the space between 3 &amp; 4 cylinders. 
I suspect that I dropped it into or somewhere around the fan housing 
during the first rebuild or during some work on the engine since 
then. Obviously the cooling would have been affected and there were 
signs of burnt rings 'cos #4 spark plug had that lovely build up that 
occurs when there's too much oil for the plug to burn. I'm sure #4 
had a burnt smell too it as well when I pulled it down. Surprisingly 
#3 seemed to be OK, the plug wasn't too bad although the head had a 
tiny crack in it that I got repaired. I was never able to tell if the 
engine was burning oil because it lost too much through the crack.

The case I used for the rebuild was a type 3 1600 that I had acquired 
with a heap of other stuff for $10 at a clearance sale of a workshop. 
It was checked by a reputable machine shop in Sydney and they align 
bored it, increased the spigot (?) holes for the bigger barrels, 
inserted case savers and a dipstick hole and tube (thanks, Bob H for 
the reminder)for around $200. I had the heads reconditioned here 
locally ($146). The lifters were also remachined ($2 each) and the 
crankshaft was polished (? $, can't remember). 

When you get horrified by the cost of things in Australia, remember 
that with our exchange rate and the generally higher level of income 
dollars compared to the US, that things work out about the same 
relatively. 

The rebuild generally went as planned. I followed the steps in the 
Wilson book and didn't have to call Ross for help and/or advice 
(except as described just below and when I found my distributor 
problem). That's not to say I didn't have hassles. I scored one of 
the conrod bearing caps 'cos there was a bit of grit in the grease I 
used. When I torqued the rod end down it wouldn't fall around the 
crankshaft journal. I could feel the rough spot when I turned the rod 
and removed the rod but I had already done the damage. 

I suppose I could have bought a complete set of bearings to replace 
the damaged one but made a decision to smooth out the bearing face 
with a nylon scourer and use the bearing. It was Ross' suggestion to 
use the scourer, but the decision to use the bearing was mine. Boy 
that bearing metal is soft. I hope my decision doesn't come back and 
bite me.

When it comes to lining up the main bearings when installing the 
crank, Muir's has the good idea of making marks on the bearings so 
you know when they're lined up with the dowels. I used a marking pen 
rather than a sharp knife but making the marks made the alignment 
easier. Wilson doesn't give any hints like this. I had a couple of 
go's at getting the bearings to seat in their spots but needed to put 
marks on them, a la Muir, before I got it right.

It took three go's (sp?) to get the case halves together. 1st one I 
didn't get the bearings in right, 2nd one I forgot to put in the plug 
at the end of the camshaft, 3rd one went OK. However, it might have 
been on the third one that I stuffed up the alignment of the 
distributor drive.

I'm still puzzled about my dizzy drive. I was sure I checked and 
rechecked it but in the end it appears to be one or two teeth out. 
The result is that the notch in the dizzy body that should be about 
right angles to the case seam is pointing to the front at an angle 
between 30 and 45 degrees from the case seam. Now my dizzy is 
rotated about 60 degrees anti-clockwise (counter clockwise to you 
Nth Americans) to get it to fire at TDC. I don't know if the numbers 
make sense but you know where the dizzy is normally, like the wire 
for #1 plug is at the back (FIF) RH side. Well now my #1 wire is 
about 3/4 of the way around to where #2 usually is. And, instead of 
the cap retaining clips being sort of in a line from left to right, 
they're almost in a line from front to back. It's not a problem, the 
timing is OK and everything, but I hope no one else ever looks at it 
to tune it. They're gonna be very confused. I think I'll put a big 
sign somewhere in the engine bay saying that the dizzy is meant to be 
in the wrong position.

When I get the time and the inclination, I might pull the engine and 
see if I can pull the dizzy drive out and put it back where it 
should be. Apparently, you have to remove the fuel pump to get the 
dizzy drive out. I guess it will be easier to do all that with the 
engine out. But I'm worried about the risk of dropping the washers 
that sit at the bottom of the drive. Maybe, I won't touch it.

The other problem is that my generator light isn't going out. The bus 
is now at the auto electrician's. First thing he found was that I had 
the two thin wires that run from the generator connected to the wrong 
terminals. He swapped them around and I think he said the generator 
was charging (phew), but the regulator wasn't working. I'll find out 
later today.

It's easy to get those wires wrong if you don't mark them when you 
remove them, which I didn't. I know the books say to mark them, but 
they don't tell you what to do if you don't. I'd like a simple 
explanation of the correct wiring from the generator. I'll have to do 
some research and develop something so I don't stuff up again.

Anyway, for those who have got to the end of this tale, 
well done. For those who've built an engine or two, I'm probably not 
telling you anything you didn't already know. For those who are 
thinking about an engine rebuild, either soon or sometime in the 
future, go for it. If you take your time and follow the good books, 
it is, as Bob H says, doable.

I'm off to Sydney at the weekend , around 150 miles, to lend the bus 
to my daughter for 6 weeks (maybe I'll never learn). I'll change the 
oil when I get down there and leave it with strict instructions that 
she check the dipstick everyday.

Bye for now,


Ian
