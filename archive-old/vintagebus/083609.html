Hello Guys    On my 66 westy I used the bouy mate type that comes in boats , 
I also bought a couple of extra attactments that I put in my canoe. So that 
when I go canoeing  I just take the holder off the door of the bus and slide it 
into the attactment on the canoe  no more spilled drinks unless you flip the 
canoe LOL   The bouy mate type will swing with the unlevelness and always stay 
level   later  and have fun  Mark Dearing
