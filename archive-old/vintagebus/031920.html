Ya= I wondered why some people had sides steps on BOTH sides of their buses, 
until I put a side step on my 65 and found it easier to access the roof rack. 
  Functional, even though I dont like the look.

&gt;  Hi David,
&gt;  If you need to load boxes or such over the sidegates due to having stuff 
in 
&gt;  the bed already that would pour out if the gates were lowered.  Then the 
&gt; side 
&gt;  step is really nice to have.  Eric&amp;Barb 
&gt;  PS we are still looking for a steel diamond plate model of side step to 
&gt; match 
&gt;  our VOA industrial look accessory diamond plate front and rear bumpers 
that 
&gt;  are going to go on our 63 SC.  EEE&amp;B
