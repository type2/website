&lt;&lt; Hey Guys 
 thanks, i took your advice and there is power to the switch - at least at 
the two
 red wires - and no power from the switch and when i jumper across the lights 
work
 - so .... i guess the only possiblity is a bad head light switch
  Thanks Again    jdd 60 std &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Funny, we have been have been figuring out the same problem today.  Turns out 
that the power is not getting through due to a loose pair of parts that are 
riveted together.  Dissconnect the positive cable from the battery, remove 
the head light switch from under the dash.   After tagging each wire with 
masking tape with the numbers of the connections they go to, take off all of 
the wires from the switch.  You will need to drill out the two rivets on 
either side of the switch.  We found that the drill would only cut so much of 
the rivets, and then the rivets would spin with the drill bit.  So had to 
fold inward with a screw driver the remaining rivet material to get the 
rivets removed.  Carefully remove the zinc plated steel cover off of the 
switch, but leave the knob shaft in place.  You will see the rivet areas that 
connect each of the wire connectors to the sprng arms inside.  Solder each of 
these areas to remove any possiblity of bad connections.  Next carefully 
remove the knob shaft after marking (Bits of masking tape will do.) one side 
of the switch block to it's connecting arm.  Note while removing how the 
reostat on the end of the knob shaft fits into the end pocket.  Now clean 
everything with fine sand paper, and remove any trace of oil/grease on any 
electrical contact surface.  Install the knob shaft, and zinc plated steel 
cover.  To replace the cover rivets use small diameter machine screws, that 
are just long enough to reach though the cover, and switch body.  Use two 
nuts each with one side filed so as to fit next to the switch body.  
Reinstall switch, and enjoy.

PS have noticed the same rivet problem with the fuse box.  Soldering up these 
loose connections would definitely improve voltage to lights, and stuff.  
Plus improve your ability to drive at night.  EEE&amp;B
