under a mango tree as a work bench. I cleaned it out and put the plug back on 
by taping it back in with the tail light bolt.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Ken,
BTDT!  You can use Cocacola due to it's high phosperic acid content to work 
loose the check ball by dissolving the corrosion holding it in there.  Just 
drip it into the top passage end till it comes out the pump end of this 
passage.  Then when the check ball is loose rinse the passage out with water 
by pumping it through to also check the action of the pump.  Eric&amp;Barb
