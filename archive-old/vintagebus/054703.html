Subject: anyone in the Fresno area?

It looks like I'll be buying a 66 Sundial from the Fresno area. However the
owner lives in Bakersfield and I'm up In BC. Anyone in the area have a
moment to take a look to check out the condition for me?
On another note, does anyone on the west coast between Canada and Fresno,
Calif have a bus tow bar for sale? Its a pain in the rear to rent tow dollys
and I cant find one to buy up here. I wont even go into the fun of mail
order and customs.
Thanks all
Chuck
