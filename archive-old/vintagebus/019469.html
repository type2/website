hi thom-

by &quot;side rails&quot; i assume that you mean the round
aluminum tubing that goes between the uprights. i can
think of no reason why you coud not do this. westy
racks are more aesthetic that structural at the best
of times!

as a side not electircal conduit is 13mm (~1/2 inch)
and can be buffed to look identical to the original.
the trick of course is only buying conduit n say a 50'
length most places want you to buy like ~1000 feet.

good luck!

&gt; I have an OG westy rack that I'm going to replace
&gt; the
&gt; side rails on (hint - don't use steel).  The
&gt; replacement
&gt; pieces - 1/2&quot; OD aluminum tubing - are several
&gt; inches
&gt; longer than the originals.  The front and rear
&gt; pieces have
&gt; to be the same lenght, but you could conceivably
&gt; stretch
&gt; it for the entire length of the bus.  Can anyone
&gt; thing of a reason
&gt; why I can't just build the rack longer?  I'm going
&gt; to
&gt; replace the wood as well; second hint: redwood looks
&gt; nice, 
&gt; but it sucks for rack material.
