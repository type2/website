Subject: Re: [T2] VW  Hippie Bashing

Who's been hippie bashing?  Is there a thread?

I've been extolling the movement as long as I can remember. It was as close
as I expect to come in this lifetime to true bliss, peace, love and the
potential to end war, greed, racism.

American conservative values -- greed, possessiveness, conformity,
self-interest created a backlash, as well as the large numbers of hangers on
that really didn't know what it was at the core (and so gave it a bad name).

But man if you could have been there, thought those thoughts, dreamed those
dreams, seen the sky when it belonged to everyone ... heard the guitars, the
voices, the songs ....

The colorful, tie-dye tribe lives on ....

That VW buses were part of that is no coincidence.  The reeked of group, of
self-sufficiency, of counterness.

Yeah, I still tool down the road in Uncle John's Van listening to Uncle
John's Band, and I feel a strange sense of remorse for those who never
tasted or even dreamed of such times ....

Peace,

John



&gt; Strange how&quot; VW Hippie Bashing&quot; is such a &quot;sport&quot; to some people--I even
&gt; wonder IF these &quot;Bashers&quot; would know a real VW Hippy if they saw one
