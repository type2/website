So, in it appears now is the time for me to tackle the Rust removal and
slight repair of the windsheild area of my bus. It seems pretty straight
forward except for one thing.

When you do the rust treatment (POR, Correless, etc..., TAR ) do you just do
the outside or am I going to need to remove the parcel tray, kickkpanels and
try and get the back side?

My plan is remove as much rust as I can, treat the rest, fill in the holes,
prime, rattle can paint then install my windows (all in under 5 minutes
flat).  Any other reccomendations.

THANKS!!
