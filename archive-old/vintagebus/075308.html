Subject: RE: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

Another vote for Clara's approach.  Two of my three buses are 6V and
everything works fine.  They even start at -20F as long as the battery
is up to snuff.  My only compaint has been the windshield wiper speed.
An application of RainX takes care of that problem.

-------------Clara answered-----------
is there something wrong with the 6V?  I've had 6V work fine.   dont fix it
if it ain't broke.

&lt;&lt; Hi, when I pick up my Splitty one of the first things that I want to do
besides the body work is convert it from 6 volt to 12 volt power. Does
anyone
know how to do this? Is their a kit I can buy or something? Lemme know.
