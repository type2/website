Subject: Sundial Campers

Hiya gang,
I'm beginning to mark out the various pieces for my Sundial Camper interior
today.  I'm re-doing the interior wood in oak.  I'll start with the interior
panels; door, cargo door, kick panels, headliner, etc, and then move on to
the cabinet pieces.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any info/tips on upholstery color.  I
think that Sundials came with either green, red, black, and maybe yellow
upholstery?  Anyway, my camper is L87, Pearlwhite.  Can anyone tell me if
this color automatically got red interior cushions?  If so, was the tent
that came with the package red/white striped?  Also, and I've asked this
before, what about the front seats?  Were they the standard Kombi salt &amp;
pepper, or did Sundial recover those seats to match the rest of the
upholstery that they added at the Sundial factory?

Any help/photos would be appreciated.  I'll post pictures when my interior
project is done.

Thanks,
Ed
