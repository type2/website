 Just added it up and I have had 7 sets of repos and 1 set of originals
 came on the bus from factory) and tried all the different brands of
weatherstrips. They all leak and the only cool factor is when you cruise
into a show with them open. In MY opinion there are 2 types of driver buses
with safaris. Thoses that admit that they leak and live with it and are
cool, and those that don't (and I would guess the only time they drive their
buses is on  and off the trailor when it is not raining) Let me have it, but
I bet I am closer to the truth than anyone else.
