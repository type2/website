If there's clearance in the shims (.003&quot; - .005&quot;) like there's supposed
to be, then I don't see how tightening the flywheel could have any
effect at all on them. I usually find that the shim that runs against
the flywheel gets a little worn, but the others are OK. I reuse any shim
that isn't dished or has a low spot worn into it. I check for wear with
a micrometer. If you don't have one, it's a good thing to keep an eye
out for at swap meets and flea markets. I paid a whole dollar for mine.
