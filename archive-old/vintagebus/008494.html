Subject: The BEST BBB V picture.

Terry Wolfe has been working his magic tonight and has put up what I think
is the BEST panoramic picture of BBB V.  I walked south to the next ridge
and using the 10 power zoom on my mavica, took a series of 16 to 17 shots of
the WHOLE campsite.  Due to inconsistancies in the way I held the camera,
the image is just slightly skewed in places but this is the BEST way I can
depict via photography the scope of this event.  I'm gonna get this photo
printed out and framed.  To me, this was BBB V.

The file is 1.76 megs big.  It's the bottom entry on the table of photos to
choose from (look at the bottom left side.)

It's worth the download IMHO.
