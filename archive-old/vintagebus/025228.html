&gt; need bosch 09001 plugs. Are these available from FLAPS or must I go to a
&gt; VW source?

Believe it or not folks, a very cheap Bosch source is good old NAPA.

Napa and bosch are promoting th heck out of their products for American
cars, and therefore sometimes have Bosch plugs, wires, caps rotors, etc,
for VW and german cars cheaper at retail than Bosch dealer shops ( like
me) can get them.  I get w8ac plugs there for 99 cents, and 09-001 wires
for about 13 bucks.
