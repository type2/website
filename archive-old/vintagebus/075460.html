&gt;#2.  We fill the tires to thier full rated pressure on the sides of the
&gt;radial we use, not to the 30+ year old info that is for bias ply tires
&gt;and very early radials.

Does your Bus still steer OK when you do this?  VW gave higher pressures
for the rear tires for most of their air-coolers.  I know Bugs are
lighter, but having your tires rotated on a Bug will make it steer like
crap, until you remember that the Bug is older than the tire guy and
he left the front tires with more air.  This may not be as much of a
problem on a heavier Bus, but I still think it might help to have the
front tires a little softer than the rears.
