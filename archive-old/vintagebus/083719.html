Subject: Zen and the Art of Bus-Buying...

Howdy Y'all, Greetings from Bus Zen!
I just closed the deal to buy a 67 Westy, here is a
little (long) story about how I came into the positon
of buying the 67 Westy whcih I will pick up next
Thursday:
The past few months, I have had a little bit of bread
in my pocket (thank you new positon at work!). Anyway,
I am thinking I will use the bread to find me a old
split window bus to re-build (I LOVE my 71, but have
been feeling the itch to own another split).  I'm
cheap and I don't want to spend more than $1000 on a
bus that doesn't run! Obviously, this limits my
choices for a split window.  A bit ago I found a
potential bus in Tennessee, dude's asking $1K, but I
am betting I can get him down to $800.  I am just
about to call him and talk about a deal when my better
judgement kicks in and reminds me that I don't have a
truck big enough or reliable enough to pull a full
trailer to Tennessee and back. My old Mitsubish
Montero was feeling tired!  So anyway, I decide that I
should take my bread and put a down payment on a good
reliable truck, so NEXT TIME I find a deal on a VW I
won't have to worry about the tow vehicle. So I bought
a used F*rd Expedition (I know, I know, Insert here
the story about how much you hate people who drive
these big friggin soccer-mom cars!!) But, I guarantee
you that I can now TOW HOME ANYTHING!! 
Anyway, I am at a music festival a couple of hundred
miles from home a couple of weeks ago, and this
younger girl and her father walk up to our 71 Westy
camp site to check out our bus. It seems thay have
just bought a 71 and it is at home needing brake work.
As we talk to them further, they tell us that they
have a 67 but it tuned out to be too much work and
decided to buy the aforementioned 71 instead and that
they will be selling the 67!!! Hello, you have my
attention!! Turns out that they live 12 miles away
from my home!!  So we exchange numbers, they call me
this week and I drive the 10 minutes to go look at the
bus. Pretty crusty for sure, but not too bad. All
complete, running engine, YEAH BABY.... We talk, agree
on a price, and next Thursday my new-to-me Expedition
will get its first taste of towing home an old VW!!!

Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
