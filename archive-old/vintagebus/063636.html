&lt;&lt; It's time to remove the front windows and crappy seals so I can clean,
 de-rust, POR 15, prime and paint the opening.  Who makes the best fitting
 replacement front window rubber?

I really liked the rubber from Bus Depot.   Much more supple and fitted 
better than WW.  It does takes longer to arrive however,
