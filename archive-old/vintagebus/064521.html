Subject: With New Rubber, Vents Won't Close

Just installed new rubber seals in window frames of my 61 Single Cab. I did 
not remove the vent glass from the frame--left that as is. Just replaced the 
rubber in the main window frame that slides out of the truck door.  Anyway, I 
put the vent back in the large window frame, inserted the washer, and riveted 
it in place. Adjusted the big spring at the bottom for good tension when 
opening and closing. Well, speaking of closing, mine don't. They get 
close--between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch, and then they won't budge. I used 
rubber from WW. Could I have done something wrong? Is there a trick to this? 
Please help, wanna get my windows back in, it's getting cold here!

Sue
