Most of you on these lists have know me for a number of years either
in
person or through the net. Most of you know Kelly Irene Aka Punk my
daughter
from shows or pics of her working in the shop. Well I'm proud to say
last
nite she graduated from ECPI College Of Technology in Greensboro.
Certified
Medical Assistant was what she took. Thats why she had been missing
some
shows and not helping out in the shop much. Hopefully now she can do
her own
thing and not take the road I did with my line of work. Also she might
take
care of my butt when I'm old and grouchier,LMAO. Sorry for the wasted
bandwidth, Grin.
