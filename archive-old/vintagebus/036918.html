I am still.... in the process of preparing my 61 bus for the paint
booth.  I believe I have left the worst job for last.  The rear engine
compartment has 38 years of crud baked to the metal.  I have tried
the generic &quot;Gunk&quot; but it is hardly touching it.  The crud is
hardened, far from soft and flakeable.   Does anyone have
recommendations on what will work?  I really need some
suggestions.  I have already spent three hours in there and have
nothing to show for it.   Thanks in advance for your responses.
