&gt;
&gt;Well , to corner like nuts I have a lowered bug


, for my bus I like
&gt;IRS ride
&gt;it really is better ,longer gear ratios and ability to run 60 mph, why I


I had a freeway flier in the 63. Did 65 all day. Engine oil temp at 190 in 
95 degree weather........



&gt;hate swing with redux. is when U accelerate it lifts the back of the bus ..

Yes it lifted, that seemed to push down on the ground and gain traction and 
steering not lose it.


&gt;as beeing an ex-vanagon driver I love vanagon's cornering and comfort that
&gt;is what I want with my split . You wont belive me but IRS is a better
&gt;off-roader also (I like stock ride height) , when the swing cambers as you
&gt;apply power it looses traction ...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Jason.
&gt;&gt;(I shouldnt be here, I dont even have a split anymore, but the 70 runs
&gt;&gt;great
&gt;&gt;now with 15 inch wheels, low profile and a 1776 with a BIG ASS oil filter
&gt;&gt;on
&gt;&gt;it!!!!!!!!!)
&gt;yeah you prefer T2 ride too, I have fitted 69 balljoint front-end as a
&gt;result with IRS I will have a split with 69 running gear ..
&gt;
Actually I prefer the splitty. Bumps in the road were harsher, but the 
feeling of the bus was a much more aggressive responsive feel. Bay 
suspension seems floaty. If I get aggresive on the gas, the front lifts, the 
bus starts slipping. Cornering is less tangible.
On the other hand, a splitty stock has its limits and handles well to a 
point and then breaks lose. The bay can handle a lot more leaning.

I guess you have to do what you want, and enjoy what feels right for you.
How did you correct the offset hieght to that the new front end gives you?

Jason
