&gt; How is he rebuilding them?  Are OS bearings
&gt; available for 36 hp in the US or is this guy working
&gt; with 'orig' spec cranks and bearings?

I can check if you are really interested.
I think we have some bearingas and rings on the shelf in the back
shop... we had a nos crank, but sold it at McMinneville two years ago...

The 36 hp guy is Jason Henning
Napa Auto Parts, 
Aloha, Oregon, 503-591-1165

Yes, he works at NAPA,
but we all need day jobs.-
