&lt;&lt; So ... damn ... my fuel reserve valve is dripping pretty bad and I'm 
having a
 tough time getting it off.  Any advice on where this thing would most likely
 be leaking and how best to fix?

you can buy a new rebuild kit from Wolfsburg West,   you have to remove the 
tap, take it apart, insert the new seals, and put it back together

I find it a PITA to install the tap with engine in.   

Drain the tank before removingthe tap, or gas falls on your head  ;(.
