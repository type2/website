:  &gt; I need some help, I am going to paint my 76 westphalia. It's that school
:  bus yellow color. But my local paint store needs the paint number. Can
:  anyone help. Thank's a lot.

Find out who your local school bus operator uses for body work.  Ask
that shop for the relevant codes.  Most body shops probably know this,
actually, as it's a mandated thing in most places, and so something
that can be looked up in a standard reference.
