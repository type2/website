Subject: SOs, Buses, Stuff Like That

There's been a little talk on the list lately about how people's significant others handle 
the bus life and all that stuff.  Figured I chime in on this topic...

My wife knew I was into VWs way way back when we first met and were friends in '98.  
Never bothered her even when we started dating in 2000.  She could appreciate the 
hobby, but I never figured she'd get into it and be excited about shows and cruises and 
stuff.

As we continued dating and later married, we would drive somewhere almost every 
weekend in my '63 Riviera Camper just for fun.  Just to relax and enjoy the day.  When 
we sold that camper last year, I was totally surprised to find that parting with that bus 
really affected her.  Lots of good memories and all that.

I was also pleasantly surprised when we found a '67 Riviera on theSamba and *she* 
was the one who encouraged me to pursue it and buy it!  And now we'll go for a drive 
and I'll hear from her how much she loves the bus and likes riding in it.  And that's 
despite the fact we're both well aware of the fabulous safety ratings split buses have in 
the front end.

I consider myself lucky.  I never expected to marry someone who would develop into a 
VW fan, just someone who'd tolerate it.  I suppose I'd own more than just the one I have 
now, but apartment living will do that to ya.
