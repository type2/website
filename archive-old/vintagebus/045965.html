Subject: it runs!!!  (61 deluxe)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I wrote this a couple weeks ago (jan 20?), and somewhy didn't send it:

Got my 61 started again. I really like this bus.   Finally got all the tranny 
bits and all sorted out and installed  with nice axle shafts and fulcrum 
plates and NOS shift bushings and rubber dust covers both ends of the tube 
and a new german shift coupler and a rebuildt tranny (4.37) with big nut RGBs 
and new brake drums and it sat on all four feet. Found the brake lines and 
hoses.  new axle boots.  put gear oil in it.    Found help to bleed the 
brakes.   For some reason it took a long time for all this to come together.

Sorted out the late bug DP motor I got from Mark with the 59 westy:  set the 
valves and ground started it and it sounded fine, replaced the oil seals in 
the doghouse cooler, installed a thermostat, new main seal, tossed the fuel 
pump as it was leaking into the oil, replaced it with a good one, cleaned out 
the 34 pict carb, blocked off the wierd intake stuff on the manifold, put a 
clutch on it that goes with the kind of TO bearing the bus takes,  put a 
generator on it ( with small diameter pulley which lines up fine and doesn't 
rub, odd odd odd) replaced the voltage regulator as the old one was bad, etc 
etc etc.   did this the other day when it was gorgeous and sunny all day.  
wow.

put it in the bus   poured some gas in the tank.   turned the key.  slow  
wrrrr  wrrr wr.   put on battery charger.   futz with replacing the wires to 
the generator, as the old ones were fugly.   turn charger to start, turn key- 
 wrooom!!  un plug charger.  wow.   the garage is filling up with exhaust.  
Open door, pulled bumpers from in front of bus,  look underneath for misc 
tools.  drive it out.  Tightest shift rH I ever saw.   No wierd noises.   
step on brakes.  bus stops. cool.  this is a very cool rig.  it seems very 
tall.  the SWR dash with pointy speedo pod is very stylee.   put bus in 
reverse.   it goes backwards.  I like this.   bus wants to stall at idle 
after the choke goes off.  I dont like DP carbs they suck.  ok.   pull bus in 
garage facing the other direction.   the tags are expired, the drivers door 
has no top half, the roof rack has stuff piled on it, and the tires are low.  
Time to get a 12V tire pump.  Did I mention I like this bus?

Maybe it'll be at Kelley Park.
