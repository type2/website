&lt;&lt; Is there a reputable manufacturer of reproduction side tents that I could
 contact?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven, 
If you mean the westie large tent.  Then no.  Steve &amp; Dawn of PLF have found a
source of some of the original westie tent material, but to do the large tent
with out poles looks like about $1,000.  So you will probably be better off
looking for used at this time.  What color tent are you looking for,
green/white, red/white, orange/white, yellow/gray or other that we have not
heard of ?   Eric &amp; Barb
