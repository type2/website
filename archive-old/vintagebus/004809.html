Hey folks,

In beginning my hunt for a mysterious short, I decided to replace the fusebox in my '67 Westy, as it was broken and has been dangling by wires for years. I ordered one (part # 211 937 037) from BFY Obsolete Parts (excellent service - ordered Sat., rec'd Mon.).

The strange thing is, the new one appears to be almost a mirror image of the original. Viewed from the front (of the fusebox, not the bus - sorry Muir) it appears identical and mounts correctly. Looking at the back it looks like a mirror image. On the right side of the OLD one (ok, now we're looking forward, like the fusebox is installed and we're driving) there are two independent terminals (i.e. not connected to any others). These are where your 16 amps go. To the left of these are six more terminals grouped in pairs (i.e. three pairs, each pair consisting of two terminals connected together on top by a copper strip - the 8 amps). Now the NEW fusebox has exactly the opposite configuration - the two left fuses are independent and the six right ones are connected in pairs.

Is the new one from a right hand drive bus or something? I can't seem to find a part number on the old fusebox - it must have been on the upper plastic that is missing. So I went ahead and connected everything in reverse, so that electrically it would be the same (now the 16 amp fuses are on the left side). Needless to say, it didn't fix my short (I'll first try searching the archives for that one), but everything electrical appears to work fine (except, of course, I still get the spark at the ground strap and my battery drains overnight - i.e. short). Although this new fusebox will probably work fine, I'd rather have one that fits the wires correctly like I'm used to.

Any insight?
