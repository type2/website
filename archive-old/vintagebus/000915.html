I can't recall a VW parts store that didn't have a little box of clutch,
brake, and accelerator pedal covers sitting around. Perhaps they're only for
bugs or 68+ buses?

They wouldn't work for me, as my gas pedal fell off a couple of years ago,
and since I was miles from home, I dug around under the rear seat and found
a large gate hinge. Bolted it through the floor and it's worked so well that
replacing it has fallen to the bottom of the priority list :-)

Well, some of my friends use duct tape, but I think that looks kind of
cheesy! I personally use Velcro...half on the pedal and the other half on my
shoes.
