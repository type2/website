sorry if the bus content is minimal or obscure, but...
just saw on the news about california's gross polluter buyback program for
high emission late model cars. they buy the cars for $1000 and then crush
them...whole...no parts sold off them. the total for the last YEAR: 19,000
cars! sure, us split drivers don't have emissions, but some people do have
later vw's, and yes, some late parts do fit and are useable on some earlier
cars (tires, engines, glass, handles, etc...) out of 19,000 there HAS to be
some percentage of air cooled vw's. plus, alot of parts off these crushed
cars could have been used for &quot;restoring&quot; same-year cars in other parts of
the country, where rust rules. sorry, but this kind of no tolerance irks
the sh%t out of me.
  
 bus content: drove my bus to the post office today, and to the bank.
noticed the clutch needed adjustment again (new cable), but then i
remembered something i wanted to pass along. when i replaced the cable, i
noticed the metal tube the cable runs through had become broken from it's
weld on the back, right where the bowden tube fits on. this is not the
first bus i have had that this has happened to. maybe some of the past
weird clutch adjustment problems could be attributed to this, since the
tube moves slightly when the pedal is depressed. in the past, i have had
the tube re-welded and the problem fixed, but this time i don't have access
to a welder right now, so i'm just living with it. keep it in mind. i have
only noticed this on earlier busses (pre 63).
