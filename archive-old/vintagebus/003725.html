Goodtimes is Goodguys.  They were still doing shows consistently until this
year, this Vallejo show being their first this year.  I think the Goodguys
saw better turn outs at their import shows and decided they'd rather do
those shows instead of ours.  I e-mailed them asking about it but never got
a response.  IMO, the last few events that KD has put on were significantly
less attended then any event Goodguys did.  Unfortunately, because KD put on
so many shows up here already, I don't think the difference in promoter is
going to bring attendance up.  That being said, I'll probably be there when
the gates open.  Unless the Nor CA listees wants to take a concensus on
which show to attend, kinda like the OCTO vs SOTO thing in So CA.

&gt; Goodguys hasn't put on a VW show in years... Its usually Goodtimes or KD
&gt; productions that puts on the shows now.
