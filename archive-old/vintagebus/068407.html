Subject: Re: [VB] Opinions needed on tire choice!

&gt; &gt; I'm very happy with mine.  The only place they are not good is in snow
&gt; &gt; where they are the next best thing to teflon.  On dry or wet pavement they
&gt; &gt; are quiet and wear well.
&gt;
&gt; How stable are they at highway speed in wet weather?  This is critical for
&gt; me.

(assuming George is talking about his 603's)

They're suprisingly good.  Very good.  I've been known to push them fairly
hard in the wet and they've never given me a problem....on pavement.

Get off the pavement and they're god-awful.  Sand, grass, mud...  But on
wet or dry pavement they're great.  Acceptable on hard dirt or gravel, but
don't try anything fancy or fun.  For that, I sure miss the yokohama 370
:)
