&gt; With all this talk about NOS mirrors, Ebay ethics, and the authenticity
&gt; of parts, I have to wonder if NOS really matters so much. 

As far as functionality goes, it doesn't make any difference at all.

However, in some vintage circles it makes a world of difference.  Check
out the judging at a Ford model A or T show.  Vehicles get downgraded for
having the wrong sort of plating on transmission bolts, for example.

I say, drive 'e,m!
