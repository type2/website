Hey Robert,

From all of the campers I've looked at, I've come to the conclusion that
there is no one correct spot. I really think it was left up to whoever was
drilling bumper holes that day. I've seen them in the blade, below the mid
point, above the midpoint. I've seen them on the over riders too. I'd say
to match what is on the front bumper.

But I'm sure someone else will have an opinion contrary to that! :)
