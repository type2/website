Subject: Saving a bus:  Need bus cutting and pasting instructions
Message-Id: &lt;199907091029345_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

I am in the process of saving a bus that someone else decided to part out.  The thing is original paint, never been hit, original headliner, good glass, etc.  When they started parting it out they took the rear view mirror, visors, and beltline trim.  They also too the passenger rear corner.  That is where my question comes in.  I need to put a corner back on now.  I picked up a corner and just want a second opinion on how to put the corner on.

The body was cut right along the bottom of the belt line.  The spot weld were drilled out (mostly) along the rear hatch.  It is cut from the beltline down about 8 inches behind the rear door.  The bottom is cut about 4 inches into the wheel well, and then across to the rear channel (that the bummper bolts to).  I am thinking of splicing it in the middle of the belt line.  I don't have much choice on the bottom because there isn't much left of the bus or the repair panel.  Is the beltline center the best place to splice the top?  

In the front I don't know whether to cut all the way through to the cargo door, take the skin off and leave the door pillar, or splice it leaving the 8&quot; of sheet metal that is there.  I know without seeing it is hard, but in general what is my best bet?  What is my best way to keep the bus straight (so the roof doesn't hang down) when I cut the corner off?  Hopefully putting the door on will help with the alignment.  Should I prop up the roof or weld in a brace?  I haven't cut this big of a chunk off before and just want to make sure I don't send the bus to the scrap heap.  Thanks for any help you can provide.  The info will go into saving this bus from its certain death with the previous owner.

Thanks,
Richard
