&gt; Trying to clean up the RGB bolt hole threads I found 2 mabey 3 that are

Hi Ken,
Go to the archives and type in &quot;Time-Sert&quot;.  Best advise we have to anyone 
who is installing a tranny is to drill and tap all good used threaded RGB 
mounting holes deeper to allow a longer 40mm bolt to be used in each instead of the 
stock 25mm.  After all the years, rust and overtorquing those OG threads are 
getting a little stressed out.  The swing plate and locking washers take up 
about 6mm of the length of these bolts.  So with the stock bolt it is only 3/4&quot; 
length of holding power at each bolt!  With a 40mm long bolt one has over 
1-1/4&quot; (1.34&quot;) length of holding power!  Before doing this we had at least one RGB 
bolt per tranny installation strip out.  since doing this mod results is &quot;0'&quot; 
stripped bolts since then.
