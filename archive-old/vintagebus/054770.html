Subject: More GL4 Q's Amsoil?

Thanks all, I have some leads on where to get some, the farm and co near me
has some on order. I did some research on synths, and Amsoil has a Marine
Final Drive Lube at 80-90W gl4 rating only, specifically stating it's not ok
to use on gl5 applications, making me think this might be good stuff. Very
pricey though....
Let me know what you think....
