Well I made it finally to Boston, 2300 miles, one fan belt, 1 quart of oil,
and one front wheel bearing later.

The trip started last thursday afternoon, I left houston, and made it only as
far as Timpson, TX, when my front wheel bearing broke again. I had not
properly prepared teh spindle last time I put new ones on, so the bearing was
not sitting properly.

I now understand why the summer road trip is much better. Breaking down around
9 at night, when it is about 40 degrees out is not too mch fun.

Anyway I had the bearing fixed on friday morning, after camping out at the
garage thursday night.I thin it was my coldest night in Texas. The next day I
made it about halfway to knoxville. Saturday I got to KNoxville, and met John,
who is completely obsessed with VWs (unlike the rest of us on the list). I got
to see his great double cab, and he let me drive his red and white deluxe
around town. I also got to drive in the passenger seat of a bus, I think that
may have been my first time. I had ridden in the back of my bus once, but
other than that I have alwasy been the driver. Being a passenger is may even
be more fun than driving.

John and his family were great, I got a pint of his home brew, a great strong
imperial stout. I recommend to anyone. And a quick walking tour of downtown
knoxville.

Next I was off to greensboro, where I met up with chris and his family.
Another great bunch. I think the stops along the trip are becoming more fun, i
need to give myself more time for these trips.

I then headed out to DC, stayed with a friend, and while parking outside his
apartment building got a great long talk from an old vw owner, and what had
happened to their '68 bus.

Just north of DC the fan belt snapped and shredded one of my heater hoses. So
after replaceing that quickly(it was damn cold, and witht eh trucks whipping
by it caused quite a breeze.

I found a heater hose a few exits later.

Eventually I made it to Boston, where I was to meet my sister at a pub(this
had been planned via email about a week or two earlier). I made it there right
on time, unfortunatly the bar was closed for a staff party, so i didn't meet
her.

Otherwise the trip was great, I hope to meet more of you all next imte i make
a trip, I will be signing off the list shortly as I will not really have easy
internet access while at school in switzerland, but i will try to make a trip
to germany at some point, and locate some vw stuff to bring back(especially
the rear bumper splash pan seals)
