&gt;    I have a front end that appears to have come out of a late 60's early
&gt; 70's bus. It is complete and under a tarp in my back yard at the moment.
&gt; When I got it I thought I would install it on my bus but I don't have time
&gt; to mess with it. Would anyone be interested in it.  I will take offers,
&gt; trades, etc....

For all of you in Nor Cal I have the same beam (ball joint with discs) if
anyone's interested let me know................

Greg
