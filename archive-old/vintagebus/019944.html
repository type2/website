Thom corrected:

&gt;These windows actually have the &quot;Plexiglas&quot; (one &quot;s&quot;) 
&gt;logo on them.  
&gt;

Ooops, &quot;Plexiglas&quot;, &quot;Big Mack&quot;, and &quot;Volkswagon&quot;

  So they were made by AtoHaas, I guess those early 
Sambas are quite the war machines. Built only four years 
after the war from parts and technology supplied by 
companies like AtoHaas that had been supporting the Nazi 
war effort. 
  It makes me realize just how successful Volkswagen was 
to be able to sell cars to countries it had waged war 
against just a few short years earlier.
  Then again, we have huge trade defecits with China, a 
country whose murderous, communist leaders continually 
remind us that we are the enemy and who threaten to go 
to war with us.
