&gt; Has anyone ever heard of a kit that you could use

&gt;  that would let you make a mold of an existing 
&gt;  part and pour a new one?

A magazine called &quot;Skinned Knuckles&quot; did a review on one of these products a 
few years ago.  I don't have any old copies on hand for the address at the 
moment, but someone might.  The magazine was great - I hope it's still 
around.  They called it a &quot;journal of restoration by restorers&quot; or something 
like that.
