Subject: RE: [VB] noisy heater

ronnie has informed me that yes, the problem has been solved, they are
longer than they used to be, and he has them available. get in touch with
him if interested.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; i have tried the current &quot;repro&quot; plastic fiberglass insulated tubes, 
&gt;   with the large and small
&gt; ends, but they were about an 20-40mm too short to work well without
&gt; overstrectching them or having to hoseclamp them. maybe that problem has
&gt; been solved since i tried them about a year ago.
