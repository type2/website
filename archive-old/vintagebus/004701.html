&gt; Hey Jerry, what you doing with that back belt on? You were not dead
lifting that beetle motor into that bus all  &gt; by yourselve? They gonna
change the exhaust on that thing?

Jerry was wearing a back belt because he spent about ten hours straight bent
over the blasting cabinet the day before. The bus engine is in Yuma at this
point. We put the engine out of my Oval in the bus so we could give it a
little test run after 30 people (including 12 listees) worked on it all
weekend. Yes, the bus engine has the correct style of exhaust. You gonna
come to Jerome and buy some raffle tickets now?
