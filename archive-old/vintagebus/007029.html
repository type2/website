I decided to throw together a web page to help organize the early
information.  I know that many of the VW lists are just finding out about
this and it might help.  This is very much a work in progress, I have only 5
minutes into it so far!

  Here is the web site:

  http://www.yourvw_dot_com/Kristin/

If you have additional content or links to pass along, please email me.

At this time I am not aware of any duplicate efforts, if there are, I will
gladly yield...
