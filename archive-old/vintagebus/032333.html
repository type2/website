Ok, so why is there no one getting these things approved?  I mean, I
understand the cost barriers on this, I understand the time and effort
involved on this; but these things DO work better than a normal hose (I
know, no proof).

Factory style brake lines are DOT approved, or claim to be.  They are a
piece of rubber with two metal fittings on them, basically.

SS Lines are a modified hose with two metal fittings on it.  Just put it on
the testing station.  I know, not that easy, but you know what I
mean.  These things have been around for many years.  If they wanted them
approved, surely they could have done so by now.  Is anyone trying to get
them approved?  Are race cars running full DOT approved equipment, IE Brake
Hoses?

Never thought about the Law Suit angle.  Very scarry stuff to say the least
with all of these heartless people that are sue happy.  People trying to
blame everything on someone else and want it &quot;paid&quot; for.  I know, way off
topic and I will leave that one alone...

Anyone know the status of approval of modified parts?  Anyone know of any
part that got approval recently?  Anyone, anything?

I sure like the idea of my SS Lines.  I really don't want to remove them
and probably won't.  But I would be happier with the &quot;legal&quot; stuff.
