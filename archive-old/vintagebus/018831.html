The belly pans are welded on.  The only way to get to the insides would be to 
remove (cut) them, treat, then re-weld.  Perhaps a better solution in the meantime
would be to check all the little drain holes and make sure they're not plugged.

Maybe you could put plugs in all the drain holes, and fill the cavity with a thinned
POR-15 solution.  Of course it would take a few gallons of this stuff, and POR-15 is
~$35/quart...

&gt; How are belly pans mounted to the bottom of the bus?  Bolted or welded?
&gt; I have a bunch of POR15 that I plan to use to keep my bus from ever rusting 
&gt; away. I've heard that the belly pans are good for water to sit a possibly 
&gt; start rusting. I would like to coat both sides of the pans, frame rails, 
&gt; outriggers, etc... I don't want to have to pay Kelly (Metwiz) to fix all this 
&gt; stuff in the future.
