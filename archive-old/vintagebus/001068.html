Hi All,
I just spent the day preping the double cab for the paint booth next week...
during which I removed the tag behind the seat and it hit me...  my tag
looks like this:

19 05 9
361
UP 265 BLUE 469869

Now, Clara stated earlier that VW changed to the bastard 40 hp and the
tunnel transmission on May 19 1959.... but mine definately has a split case
trany (and the PO verified that it was the original transaxle).  So, all
along, I thought the first line of the tag meant 1959 but NO, it means May
19... (does the single '9' mean 1959???)

So, could have this pickup rolled off the line the day of the switch???
Could it have been possible that it got the split transaxel???
Where double cabs diverted in the line a bit so it got an earlier chassis
and a later engine?
Would the engine have gone in near the end of the assembly line so it would
have been the 40 hp???

Wow, what fun!

Cheers,

Dave

&lt;&lt; OK, before I get too excited about a Okrasa 36 hp in my '59, I want to
 clarify what is the correct engine that should be in it in the first place.
 I know VW changed to the 40 hp late in 59 or in 60 but I can't remember.

 My chassis number is  469869.

 Also, how can I tell if I have the original engine?
  &gt;&gt;
thanks for including you VIN, as it was a mid year change.   The &quot;modified
36hp&quot; motor aka bastard 40hp was introduced at CH # 469 447 on May 19 1959.
There also changed at this point to the tunnel case tranny from the split
case tranny.  So, yours is one of the very first post 36hp buses.   In the
36hp buses it is a bit tricky installing a motor with the later heater boxes
as they tend to hang up.

I seriously doubt you have the original engine, as those bastard motor
tended
to self destruct, which is why they were only made a short time, very
embarassing for VW.   Check the engine number and look in the back of your
Idiot book and see if it is in the right area.   The original motor would
not
have a Letter before the number.
