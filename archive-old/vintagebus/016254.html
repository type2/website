There's a difference between selling a bus with the &quot;goodies&quot; attached or not,
and selling a bus with basic stuff removed.

If you have an over-accessorized bus, then it's probably going to be easier
to sell it if you lighten it up a bit.  Most bus people are very price-concious,
and won't want to pony up the extra bux for ambo fans, safaris, etc, etc.  -
they expect that stuff to be thrown in for free.

OTOH, I've seen buses where basic parts, such as engine lids, bumpers,
seats, lights, etc have been removed, and were sold before the bus was,
or were offered to the new owner shortly after the sale.  

Middle seats and bumpers are not accessories.

The more contentious case is where the bus is advertised/marketed/shown with 
various goodies, and then they disappear between the making of the deal and 
delivery.   

On a couple of occasions, I've gone and looked at a bus,
liked it, then the owner sez, &quot;Oh, by the way, I've promised the 
(bumpers/engine lid/side gates) to a friend of mine, so they don't go with 
the bus.&quot;  I even had one where the engine didn't go with the car.  On
all occasions, I walked.

Your best bet on the '54 barnambulator is to section in a 21/23 roof and
corner window sections...  Then it becomes a $40k car practically overnight...
