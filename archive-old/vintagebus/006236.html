Adam queries:

&gt; If I pull out my 6v starter on my 12v-converted '62, can I just plug in a
&gt; 12v starter?

Nope, different number of teeth. It will work for a while, but will destroy
the flywheel and the starter pinion gear.
Just use the 6v starter as is, the windings are heavier than a 12v and it
cranks much faster. I've used them like that for years, never had a problem
and the engine really JUMPS to life.
