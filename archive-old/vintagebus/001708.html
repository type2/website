&gt;More rainbows than vw lovers, more drum circles than swappers,more
&gt;load music and obnoxious people them past years, more each year it
&gt;seems. What to do before next year, maybe im dreaming, but give me
&gt;back the 1st couple simple Jeromes. These are only my opinions so
&gt;yell at me if you want, but I think something needs to be gone.

Oh, I dunno. The loud music quiets right down when you offer to sell their
body jewelry at the swaps in the morning, still attached to it's appropriate
part. Besides, I traded a couple of beers for a front clip to a split. What
a deal!!! Thanks, John, you probably could have held out for a twelve-pack.
With the exception of the Westy poptop seal a vendor was gonna hold for me
being sold while I went to camp for more dinero, I found most of the doodads
I was looking for, and got them reasonable or better. Got a nice 3.88 Rancho
tranny from Ronnie, a new fuel guage sender in the box for 10 bucks, etc.
Not like the $1200.00 a guy was asking for an NOS ribbed pickup bumper and
brackets at the SOTO meet! The dredlock wearing/bongo playing/pierced
lip/ain't took a bath in a year thing is a little precious, though. I
suppose they want to be unique, just like all of their friends...I had to
stop for a lot less buses this time, of course if I saw dred's silhouetted
in the windows, I kept right on a driving, since these people must be
heavily sponsored, they couldn't have a job they need to get back to. The
true bus people are better than gold, and maybe next year we can have all
buses in the lot, all others on the hillside below camp.  8D  As to the
mags, if it doesn't have a bunch of shiny Cal-look bugs lined up neatly on
pavement, I don't think you'll see them. It still is the biggest bus event I
know of, the SOTO meet included. See you in Tucson and at Buses by the
Bridge III.
