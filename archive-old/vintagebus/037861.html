hey all,  I have a 67 micro and all of a sudden my shifting was rough and i 
hear a metal swirling screeching noises when i push in the clutch.  I just 
adjusted the clutch and the shifting is back to normal but the metal 
screeching swirling sound has gone down but is still pretty loud.  I just 
replaced the throughout bearing about 1700 miles ago and was wondering if 
that is the problem and why it only lasted 1700 miles.  any hints are well 
apreciated   peace out

well something in there is bad .   pull the motor.  Why is my memory telling 
me the throwout bearing is bad when it sounds funky EXCEPT when you push in 
the clutch?      Maybe something came loose.  a clip?   Better check it out.  
 then again, the throwup arm could be dying.   only one way to tell.     
check you tranny boots while the motor is out.  fuel line?   changed trans 
oil in the last year/10K miles? engine to body seal nice?   install your 
thermostat!
