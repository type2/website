Isaiah, reporting in with his daily problem.

well...after the DBG meeting I got a few ideas on why my motor won't run
worth a hoot and idles super low and choppy.  Thick oil....I
said..ok..fair enough. So I changed it today in the snow and slush to a
much thinner, more appropriate, oil.  Helped with the cranking a little
bit...but not much.
It was warmer today so it did start....and then quit.
the motor runs really choppy and will quit under its own power...or lack
thereof.  it idles super low and its just no fun.

my list of things I've done.

checked out the choke...its OK
fuel is fine
pump is pumping
filter is good
gas is getting to the carb
new plug wires - that are on the correct cylinders
new cap
recent condenser and properly gapped points
timing is on
carb recently rebuilt
no vacuum leaks
etc etc...

Well you mentioned just about everything except-

Let me relate yesterdays story to you. My friend Douglas (not on the list so real names are fine) had built an engine for some one else. He had been fighting to get it to run right for about two weeks when he finally asked me for help. In a matter of about five minutes I determined that one of his new plugs was not firing at all and two others were very weak.

The point (moral if you like) of this story is, go to the basics first. Check your plugs, even if they are new.
