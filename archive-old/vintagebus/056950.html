Subject: Re: [VB] Bug engine in a Split bus

If the their both the same style flywheel (6v/12v) should bolt right in.

On lagwagens (bays) there's a hanger.

&gt; Can someone tell me things that must be considered (other than 6 v, 12 volt stuff) when putting a 1600 DP Beetle engine into a 66 Kombi that has the original (and apparently seized) 1500 engine in it now.  I heard there is some type of bracket or hanger that connects to the oil pump cover plate??  Or is that just for putting a T1 engine in a T4 bus?? can anyone share experiences of their own?
