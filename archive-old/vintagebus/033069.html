&gt;on           the road, jus because it isn't his style?

  &gt; VWs look *horrible*, it's an abomination. My unbiased

  &gt;  Dig a big pit and drive all the Eurovans you can find into

I now add my $.02:

I used think that any VW that was not in stock, original condition was a
&quot;waste&quot;.  After being around VW's now for more than 12 years and talking to as
many VW owners as I have, I have come to appreciate the VW for what it is and
what is has become.  To say that a custom VW belongs in the junk yard is the
true &quot;abomination&quot;.  Volkswagen, after all, is the &quot;people's car&quot;.  And no
other automobile is history has ever lived up to it name as these cars have.
The VW has truly become a reflection and an expression of one's individuality.
Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't take a nice, stock VW and alter it, or chop the
top or anything like that.  But this is my preference.  If people want to
continue to drive lowered cars with fancy paint jobs and big motors, more
power to them.  Would anyone tell Gene Berg, were he still living, that all of
his &quot;ideas&quot; where a waste of time because by altering the vehicle he was
making things worse!  I say just drive and enjoy your VW, no matter what year,
model, or make you have.  Whether it's lowered or not!
