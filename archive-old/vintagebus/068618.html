Subject: RE:  Ronnie's Bad Camberg post

So,

Ronnie, you having the military fly your knu Toorak Dry Cleaners delivery van
over for the convoy?  ;-]

What are you going to do with it, anyway?  Restoration?  Paint?  What shape is
the engine/tranny in?  Rust?  Inquiring minds wanna know.  Or do you have it
yet?  If not tell us about it when it arrives.  DETAILS!  You gonna change it
over to L-H drive?

BTW, you guys forgot to charge me for the VW front emblem I got back in Jan.,
with the tranny.  Tell you what.  . . . Instead of settling up, you can throw
me in the lake next year!

Curt . . . Your &quot;best&quot; customer
