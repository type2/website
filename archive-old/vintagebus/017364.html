Subject: front door seals
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id SAA77011

I thought i would finally get around to installing the front door seals I got
from bus depot last year. I took them out of the package and they aren't quite
the same as the original. The orignal were grey foam-type rubber. Suliod all
the way through, with the one going across the top of the door having a non
square profile(alittle but like a u-shape)

Anyway the new ones are rectabgular in profile, and hollow in the middle. They
also have two very tiny grooves extruding on one side.

My problem is this...I put them in (without glue) just to test the fit. When I
shut the door it doens't seem to shut all the way, with the old seals the door
shut flush on the outside, now it kind of sticks out a little.

Any suggestions?
shoudl i have bought them from someone else?
