&gt; [battery not cranking engine]
&gt; Any ideas???

Your battery wouldn't VOOM if you put four thousand
volts through it.  It has run down the curtain and
joined the bleedin' choir invisible.  It is an
ex-battery!

There is a time to every purpose under heaven, and
seven years (with storage) means that it is time to
gather a new battery together.

I had a battery on my Ch_at_vy that would run the lights,
radio, etc real great, but as soon as you put a load
greater than about 20 A on it (like hitting the
starter), it went down to about 2 volts.  It was just
an old battery in the process of dying.  A new battery
fixed it up good.

&gt; Checked it again and found a nice hole burnt/blown thru
&gt; the back of the housing..... 6V doing 12V duty maybe?

That might be part of your problem but it's not your
entire problem.  The currents in a 12 V Bus are half
of those in a 6 V Bus, so in one sense, the switches
and wires from a 6 V Bus are twice as good as they need
to be for 12 V.  (Look at the wiring diagrams for early
and late Buses...the wire cross sections didn't change
when they went to 12 V.)
