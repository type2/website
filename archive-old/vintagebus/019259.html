Of course we all know I'm talking about cylinder heads here.  :-)

I'm getting the mystery engine out of the Kombi rebuilt by a very reputable
builder in the area, so in fact he might already know what I'm trying to find
out here.  The engine is a dual-port, and I've decided for various reasons to
keep it that way.  I've seen mention on the list about heads with more metal 
around the plug holes to help prevent the ol' DP crack problem.  I've been
able to find reference to a part number (CB 041) and that these are Brazilian,
but not really how to obtain a pair in case the builder doesn't know.

Anybody know details on these?  Perhaps how much more they cost than stock DP
heads?  It'd be nice to be able to say &quot;Yeah I know how to get those&quot;.

I got more work done on the Westy today, most of the rewiring up in the cab is
finished.  Last remaining is an odd turn signal/hazard problem that I'm still
chasing down, I may post about that tommorrow if I can't resolve it.  I drop
off the engine tommorrow too :-)  This is my first time having an engine
built for me, unfortunately I don't have time to do a good job rebuilding 
another engine right now.  It's also good because it'll get done faster, which
greatly increases my chances of making Everybus in the Westy this year!

Also thanks for the prior input...the lock cylinder is back in and with the
rewiring up front the old locking switch works perfectly!  I wonder why the PO
ever stopped using it?
