Hiya i'm behind on my digests so this might be a little late ,,on the 
windshield of that talk to Ronnie,at old volks home ,,he can get the for the 
windshield from his England source ,,they work good i have used several of 
them ,,matter of fact have to replace the one on my 67 also ,,as far as donor 
on that part i wouldn't fool with it you spend more time draging your tools 
to cut it out than its worth ,,to me any way my .02 cents on that one ,,,a 
good repo dogleg is hard to find ,,i have tried most all and haven't found a 
supplier that can make the 2 sides the same i end up modifing one or the 
other ,,also ck with Ronnie on the floor section i think he was trying to get 
those fabed in England ,,rust free is good if you can find it but ,,new is 
alot less pain in the a**,,just a few comments from someone who fights rust, 
sheet metal,and other peoples feeble attempts at restoration,,,,Grin ,,
oh p.s ,due to my daughter being in an accident this last thursday i am 
behind on mail and the web pages will not be updated till first of the month 
,,she is ok but bruised from nose to toes ,had mild concusion ,,and scrapes 
and a shiner from hell ,but was home that nite ,,sorry for the delay in 
everything ,,but i have my priorties ,,,,later
