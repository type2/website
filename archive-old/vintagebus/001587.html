So my  brake lights don't work - I'm a  bit confused becuase my 60 only has
one bulb in the tail lights.  My tail lights work fine.  My license plate
light does not work either ..... hmmmm.  I think my license plate bulb
holder is just too dirty but ... I'm not sure.  Also, my running lights do
not work.  So there is not interrelationship between running lights and
license plate lights right?  Or is there?

Lordy, lordy, lordy, hep me jesus
