Subject: Re: [VB] Beetlemex Engine, Broken Cam...

One of the problems that some of the mexi-motors has had is the cam gear
itself is not machined for a proper fit against the crank gear. The extra
lash wears the the cam gear down and can also cause a slight &quot;knocking&quot;
noise at idle.

Replacing the cam gear (which means the cam too in this case) with one that
meshes correctly is what needs to be done. If you're tearing into the motor
like you are, ditch the filter pump and go full flow. No sense not doing it
while the case is apart. That way you can run a regular aluminum bodied pump
and clear any exhaust you may want to run. The only thing you're looking at
is a pump, some fittings, hose, and a filter adapter if you drill and tap
yourself.

That's what I would do anyway.

&gt; Ronnie,
&gt; The broken cam looks like a normal, 4 rivet, dished camshaft with
&gt; the riveted cam gear.  I have not seen an all one piece VW camshaft
&gt; yet.  I'm curious as to what could have caused the rivets to come loose
&gt; on this cam.  I've not noticed any odd wear on the cam bearings.  The
&gt; cam lobes have a bit less lift than the stock german cam I compared it
&gt; to and the lobes are dressed down on the sides more than old german
&gt; stock.  The broken cam gear is too messed up to tell exactly how it was
&gt; wearing.  Although, all of the teeth are very worn and shiny.  I wonder
&gt; if this amount of wear would occur quickly in its fast and catastrophic
&gt; failure on the road?  Also, the -8 stamp on the cam gear seemed
&gt; different!  Maybe it was a terrible camshaft choice at the factory?
&gt; Thanks, everyone for your help!
