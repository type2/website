OBC...

Finally...after several tries, several pullers and thousands of miles on a
backed off axlenut....I have finally succeeded in breaking loose a rear drum
frozen to the axle splines.

When you're doing those brakes...don't forget to grease them damn axle
splines before putting that drum back on!  Now I just need to find time to
complete this brake job .  Then drop the motor for a reseal and other
maintenance.

Ronnie..you've got mail coming...

Later,

I had the same experience on my 65 DC 12 years ago. I found that running a
stainless steel fine brush wire wheel over the axle splines and a small hand
stainless steel wire brush into the drum splines cleaned them up good. After
that I placed a little carbon CV joint grease on them and slid the drum back
on in several directions to make sure the grease was spread evenly. I then
wiped off the excess and remounted the drums. Whoever bought my truck won't
have such a time as I did when they go to replace the brakes or wheel
cylinder.
