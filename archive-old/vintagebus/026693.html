Matt,

Both you and Jim are correct.  There are two styles of this &quot;C&quot; channel tent
mount.  Jim is correct in that the Westfalia company did mount their tent to a
channel which was attached to the rain gutter as Jim described.  The aluminum
railing clamps to the rain gutter and is about an inch and a half tall.  This
helps offset the tent higher for more (not much more) head room.  This style
went along with the SO42/44 interiors (64-67).  After that, they dumped the
aluminum channel in favor of a rubber molding that griped the rain gutter
directly.

The tent you have does mount directly to the roof of the van.  You will have to
drill the mounting holes.  I'm not sure exactly how high the channel should be
mounted.  I think you will need to set the tent up and judge where the best
point will be.  I think you'll need more than two hands to accomplish this.

Did you look at Joe Clarks tent page.  I'm sure the sundial and Westy tents are
displayed there.  Note, there are I'm sure more than a few more iterations of
these two.

&gt; correct me if I'm wrong, but if a sundial/riviera style tent with the 7' long
&gt; C channel guide was mounted to the rain gutter above the cargo doors, anyone
&gt; (standing up) that was taller than the rain gutter (5'5&quot; or so) could knock
&gt; their head on the front bar of the tent every time they tried to get into the
&gt; bus.  They also wouldnt be able to stand under the tent if it were mounted on
&gt; the rain gutter.  Unless they were shorter than 5'5&quot; of course.
&gt;
&gt; I dont think it would work to extend the C channel strip straight up off the
&gt; rain gutter because that would create a gap between the tent and the bus and
&gt; we learned at the last Jerome that it's no fun when there's a gap there and
&gt; it starts raining.
&gt;
&gt; If we were to attach this C channel strip to the bus like it's intended, we
&gt; could mount it up 6&quot; or along the curved part of the roof above the cargo
&gt; doors and that way the top of the tent would be 6' + tall and would be
&gt; securely attached to the bus and there'd be no gaps for rain or wind to get
&gt; in through.
&gt;
&gt; I know it's tough drilling holes in the roof of a bus, but the bus IS a
&gt; sundial tent and the tent IS a sundial tent (maybe riviera) and the C Channel
&gt; strip IS original, I dont see any choice but to mount it the correct way.
&gt;
&gt; Does any of this make sense?  Am I off my Rocker or on the right track?
