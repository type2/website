66 Westfalia SO-42 small pop top camper
original Southern California  car, original black plates
Walk-thru
blue / white
stock motor with alternator (12v)
chrome rims

super solid car
interior is missing the small seat behind driver , but has ice box , bed , 
storage cabinet and shelf above bed,
Wood needs to be sanded down as it was painted white.

this is a real solid car, but it is not show condition,  the paint is very 
nice but not perfect as it has a few small scratches.

Price for the list is $4000, I am going to start at $5000 at Pomona next 
weekend
