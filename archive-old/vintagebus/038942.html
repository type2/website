I have seen this bus it is nice,but $99,999.00 nice?He is into it with a few
bucks.If you offered $5k he would probably take it.New brakes,engine.Good
paint and interior complete.

The owner purchased it and then had to sink some major cash into it and got
taken by the places he had it fixed at(non VW and saw the young hippy kid as
easy prey)on the road.

It is located in the Metro Detroit area,I can get pics for the Powerball
winner if needed.
