&lt;&lt; Greetings, all knowing list!
 Yesterday afternoon I had the good fortune to find a oil cooler, shroud,
 fan, front tin and thermal flaps at a wrecking yard in VERY good
 condition.  Perfect, since I have been in the market for at least a
 cooler, and I have been convinced to &quot;upgrade&quot; from the stock setup on
 my 1600 sp (pre doghouse).
 
 1) Any thoughts on the value of the thermal flaps (at the base of the
 shroud, on each side)?  It appears that many uprights are without...
 (including my recently acquired 66 with rebuilt 1600 sp!)
  -- - - 
having the flaps, and the spring and the rods - and the rest of the whole 
thermostat set up helps your motor reach operating temperature quicker, and 
actually helps it run warm enough in the winter.  yes many are missing this 
stuff, poor them.  did I mention it helps warm your heater air up too  :0
...........
 2) The parts were from a 74 bug...  At first glance, it appears that
 everything will fit nicely on my bus' 1600.  But I noticed that the
 shroud completely covers the oil cooler, and exits thorough a port in
 the front tin.  This appears different from other shrouds that have one
 side of the cooler exposed on the backside of the shroud.
-------
there are two bits of tin that attach to the forward side of the doghouse 
shroud, to sen dthe warm air outside the engine compartment -   also you need 
the forward tin with the hole for the vent tin.  If the vent bits are missing 
the side of the cooler is exposed, yes.   But you want to vent the heated air 
outside the engine compartment, nicht wahr?
...........
 
 My question...  will the 74 parts work?
 
 3) Finally, any cautions on the installation of these parts?  It seems
 straight forward.
  &gt;&gt;

yes, they work.  You will likely need the remove the stud for the oil cooler 
from the case,e and get a special stud with the M6 on one end and M8 on the 
other, 

also, gett the used cooler through flushed out.  Very Important.
