Subject: Re: [VB] repop bumper brackets all bad?

&gt; I recently picked up a pair of new rear bumper brackets from a guy who was 
&gt; selling them on thesamba for cheap (told they were Brazilian) for my '65.  It 
&gt; seems like the flange that bolts up to the bumper has insufficient angle 
&gt; because my bumper tips down now a fair bit (which it did not do prior).

Sounds like they're baywindow brackets.

&gt; What does repop stand for, anyways?

Reproduction.
