NQ,

There have been times that I've gotten discouraged, when I've run into
problems with my bus and the reliability and comfort of more modern
vehicles started to appeal to me...

For what it's worth, here are a few things that kept me hanging on...

First of all, I enjoy the community of VW folk, and bus folk in
particular. Most of the bus folk I've met are people that stand out from
the norm. Usually above average intelligence, usually a little bit
radical from a political point of view, adventurous, always interesting
to hang out with... This list has helped keep me going when I've gotten
discouraged, but I've also gotten help from local VW enthusiasts (not
necessarily bus folk). Maybe you could use some help from someone local
whose company you enjoy...

Another thing that has helped me keep going is the respect that I get
from people when I've told them about all the stuff I've done to keep my
bus running. Most folks have never touched a wrench, much less had to
fix thier car on the side of the road to get home... 

Bus folk usually have a lot of interesting stories about trips they have
made. Sometimes the trips are to interesting places, sometimes the trip
itself was the adventure. Most folks love to hear a good story...

I enjoy the attention the bus gets while cruising downtown with the
safaris open on a warm summer night... As ratty as my bus is, it still
gets more attention than even the most pimped out rice burner... 

There is nothing like the satisfaction I get when I've done something to
improve my bus, like tuning it up, or fixing the steering, or making the
stereo better, or even just washing it. 

These are just a few reasons why I drive a bus instead of a T*yota.

Another thing to keep in mind is that there is no shame in getting help.
Sure, I'd like to do it all myself. I'd like to build a freeway flier
tranny for my bus. Realistically, though, I will probably get someone
experienced to do it for me. Maybe one day I will tackle a project like
that, but it will be on a spare tranny that I don't NEED, when I can
afford the time and money to do it myself. I'd like to build a hot rod
engine for my bus someday, but for right now I'm running an engine that
I traded a waterbed for. I'll get to it eventually. I suggest you buy a
bug engine cheap to keep you going while you build the engine you
want... Drive your bus!

I guess the point that I'm making is, enjoy your bus for what it is.
Don't bite off more than you can chew, do things a little at a time...
Have fun with it! 

david
