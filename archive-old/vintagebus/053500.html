&lt;&lt; Speaking of pulleys, I picked up a few extras today at Pomona.  One has a

 capital D stamped on it along with a VW logo.  Any idea what it stands 
for...year?  Application?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
Assuming you are speaking of lower pulleys the about 3/8&quot; tall &quot;D&quot; seems to 
indicate the 2:1 ratio lower pulley.  Which is the largest one we know of 
that will fit 40 HP and later upright engines.  Was stock for DP engines with 
the Doghouse cooling setup which required not only this lower pulley, but the 
33, 34, or later 35mm wide (Inside measurement.) cooling fan.  Where the 
earlier non-Doghouse SP engine only used up to a 29mm wide fan.  If one wants 
to havelots of overheating fun run a Doghoused engine without either or both 
of these!  Eric&amp;Barb
