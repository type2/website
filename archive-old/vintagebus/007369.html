Man I'm thrilled.  I picked up my tires today from Mark.  I never did see
him - only talked to him on the phone and saw his wife and pickup and that
was about it.  These 195's I got are basically a low rating pickup tire or
high end passenger car tire.  They are only a 1ply sidewall which I figured
on but they are rated at 1477 pounds.  They are narrower than a 205 and fit
beautifully on these 15&quot; rims.  I took 2 pictures - one of the tires all
leaning up against the garage and then a view of the tape measure layed out
across the tread.  The total width of the tread is about 6 to 6.5&quot; whereas
the total sidewall to sidewall clearance is 6.75&quot;.  They are a taller tire
as well.

So despite all the warnings, suggestions, info, etc.  I did my own research
on top of it all and ultimately, I must live with my decision despite
whether some of you nod in agreement or shake your head violently from side
to side.  I got a service agreement with these tires and they are rated for
80,000 miles.  I'm gonna like 'em - matter of fact, I already do!  These
babies are gonna take me to California!

Tomorrow I'll go put the tires on the bus and Saturday I'm bringing her
home!  I can't wait!!!
