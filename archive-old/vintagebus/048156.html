 Well I got a couple thousand on the trans now and still I am not

sure I like it. There is a 39 per cent drop between 3rd and 4th gear so you

really have to watch the R's. Allready ruined 1 set of P/L's and just

replaced those before my last journey. 600 miles r/t, cruising on the flats

at 75 mph without a problem, hit a hill though and watch out. The best thing

is 3rd gear, I could pull long hills in 3rd at 55 mph without a problem,

still haven't hooked up the Autometer tach yet as I didn't realize I needed

a tach adapter when useing an electronic ignition DUH!. Another problem I
- - -  - -
sorry, but what is a P/L??? (bet its real obvious too)

also, are you running the little nut RGBoxes?

think NQ is right abut the gearing and the motor being paired, so you think 
what you have is a little high geared for your 1776?  does that mean you'll 
build a 2l motor?
