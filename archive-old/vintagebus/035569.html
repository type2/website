Subject: Re:  [VB] on the road to jerome 2001
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


about two years ago i heard of the jerome az. show
and for some odd reason i just have to go to show i dont know why its 
something in the back of mi head
so this year i picked up a 59 kombi and when i bought this fine machine i 
vowed o go to the jerome show of 2001 . so far ive picked up a new zero mile
1600cc if jus purchaced a gene berg dip stick sensor and this wednesday im 
ordering my tranny from i.t.s im also planning to install a typeIV oil 
cooler. does any one have any input so i can make  
the 1500 mile round trip any more worry free?

brakes of course.  (flex hoses)

steering, a decent set of tires, camping stuff.  stock oil bath bong action 
air cleaner.

electricals

how about some windsheild seals.  and some seats that are comfy to set on and 
a bed and cabinets in the back.   cutrtain?  if you dont want to drill holes 
put magnets in the curtains, they will stick to the bus, you can pull them 
off and fold them away when not in use.

where do you live-   if they dont salt the roads just use it as a daily 
driver, if they do start in spring as a daily driver,   and you will have 
worked out its kinks by then and it will happily make the trek.

polish the dash.
