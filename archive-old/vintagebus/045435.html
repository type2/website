 Sorry pal, but a '65 Crewcab doesn't have a hood or
 windshield squirters.

It was a funny joke though!!!!

actually, windsheild squirters were standard as of 64 I believe, though rarely
is the bottle still there and functional. Look under the windsheilds- the
squirter 'eyes' should be there.  The bottle would be on the dash tray on the
drivers door side from the steering wheel.

I don't want one though as they take up space on the dash I'd rather use for
junk (yes- wierd) and anyway I can use the things as the gas stations, though
I'd only need to a short time of the year in this soggy climate.  :)
