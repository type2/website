I bought some from Wolfsburg west...I have used all
their panels for quite sometime and they fit great
BUT!!!! Their damn battery trays SUCK!!! 

They fit terrible and in fact don't even come close to
fitting...problem is they don't fit the curve of the
actuall corner..I had a 1 inch gap between the edge of
the tray and the corner.  this happened with the
drivers side of my bus which had an original corner. 
But also happened (even worse) on the paaenger side
where i installed a WW repop corner too.

These battery trays were too small in the curve of the
corner..if they had been to big I could have trimmed
them down and fitted them..but being too small I had
to add metal and refab the curver and lip...a total
PIA!!!

Tds

&gt; &gt;I need to change the battery trays on both sides,
&gt; are the repros decent ?
&gt; &gt;This bus was hit in the back at sometime and both
&gt; sides were &quot;repaired&quot; with
&gt; &gt;flat sheetmetal
