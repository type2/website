Picked up my 'camper today (yay) and it is in surprisingly better
condition than I anticipated.
It is a 6v though and I am going to convert it to 12v.
What bits can I pull off of my '67 to use?
I guess starter motor &amp; generator, battery, &amp; globes obviously.
but what about indicator flasher relay &amp; wiper motor?
Will I need to change the ignition switch, coil, plugs, dizzy to handle
the increase in voltage or are these still O.K. to run on 6 &amp; 12v?
Is there a section on conversions in the complete idiots guide or
similar book?
Many thanks,  Daniel

congrats on the new bus!    Now --- why change it?   Why fix what ain't 
broke?   Enjoy the bus a bit before getting dirty- surely it will need work 
later.

there is much on 6V/ 12V/ conversions/ making lights brighter in the 
archives.   Cleaning electric connections heps dim lights.
