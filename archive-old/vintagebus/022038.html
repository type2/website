My 57 is painted entirely underneath.
Ive seen another 57 painted in just the wheel wells.
Ive seen busses painted just on the inside jambs, Ive seen busses painted 
EVERYWHERE inside, Like my 57.
I think it just mattered who was painting it and how much paint was in the 
spray gun.
Maybe Thom can set up a database for whos initials are logged on the 
passenger side headlight bucket?
I could have sworn mine said &quot;666&quot;
My friend told me 10 years ago he saw someone wrote &quot;F**K USA&quot; inside the 
original paint on the headligth bucket!!!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt;Time is growing ever so near now for the floors and a couple dime size 
dents 
to be fixed.  Ordering the Glassurit SWR and CB for the 57 deluxe should be 
taking place in the next month or so.  This is a father/son project with me 
(the son of course) having to do all the research, mechanical work, etc...The 
biggest question that comes to my mind at this time would be what color to 
paint the undercarriage?  I have seen alot of OVER RESTORED busses that are 
painted SWR under there but have never been able to get a respectible answer 
about it.  I remember hearing from some one on the list that the bottom was 
left in primer??  

So paint or primer?

Also I remember hearing that the front shocks were black as the rear ones 
were gray?  True?  Gotta please those Vintage NAZIS you know! =)

Now for the final question.  I think you can answer this one for me thom....
How much paint would it take to paint the bus in the SWR the same way as the 
factory?  How much CB?

Thanks for all the help!  I should really get the pics developed huh?  Oh 
well I will this weekend.
