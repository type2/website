  Howdy. It's been a while since I did a run of t-shirts, but folks have been
asking about them, and so I'm doing another run along with the EVERYBUS shirts
for this year. Pictures are on my t-shirt page, at:
http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/tshirts.html

I am doing the &quot;All new Netvergnu:gen shirts&quot;, the official list t-shirt of the
Vintagebus and Type2 lists, and Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts, as seen
toward the bottom of the page. Now
you can have something stylish to wear to bus events or to the office, to show
others your true VW-coolness, and also easily recognize other listmembers at
events.
  These have been officially sanctioned by list and domain masters Ken Hooper,
Thom Fitzpatrick, and Steve Dolan.
  Shirts will again be $15.00, and are available by pre-order in sizes of kids'
large through adult XL. For an extra $5, XXL or XXXL are available. Long sleeve
shirts are also available for an extra $5. I will try to print up a few extras
to sell later on, but please do us both a favor and pre-order if possible. The
deadline to pre-order is April 1, which means I must have your order in my hand
by then, as that is when I will be placing the final order. If you are going to
EVERYBUS, you can pick them up there. Otherwise, shipping is $5.00 per shirt,
which will be shipped out Priority Mail.

Here's what I need from you-

-check or money order for your order $15.00 per shirt
                                    +$ 5.00 per each XXL or XXXL
                                    +$ 5.00 per each Long Sleeve
                                    +$ 5.00 each for shipping/handling

-index card with your name, mailing address, e-mail, and SIZE,QUANTITY, and
         DESIGN of shirts ordered.

  Send to:
Poor Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave.
Raleigh, NC, 27605-1832

Thanks again, and hope to see you at EVERYBUS!
