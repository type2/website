Hi Wade,
Well we did this once for a friend long ago!  On a unsupported 12 volt 
starter we mounted a 6 volt gear assembly with a special made brass bushing 
so it would fit onto the smaller diameter 12 volt starter shaft.  Years later 
our friend took this starter to a rebuild shop and blew thier minds with it!
