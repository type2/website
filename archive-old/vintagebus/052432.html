&gt;
&gt; The &quot;new&quot; grey weatherstripping body to door seal can be used on the front
&gt; drivers and passenger side doors okay. Sounds like they need aligning and
on
&gt; my driver side I found a thin metal factory shim between an upper hinge
and
&gt; the body. If you are using the repro rubber seal around the front windows
of
&gt; these front doors, they tend to be a bit oversize and will not shut
&gt; properly. The use of talcum powder on this rubber really helps the front
&gt; doors shut and open properly if that is the problem.
&gt;
&gt; I used the &quot;new&quot; grey weatherstripping on the side doors and had some
&gt; problems. The original weatherstripping is &quot;formed&quot; and after looking at
my
&gt; old stuff I realized it was dirty, but had no tears. So I cleaned it up
and
&gt; put it back in place. Of course it works perfectly and looks &quot;new&quot; but
with
&gt; a slight age patina. Using the new stuff and trying to re-align the side
&gt; doors to fit is a no win game from my experience.
&gt;
&gt; So the question is.... has anybody used the &quot;new&quot; grey weatherstripping on
&gt; the side doors and heat formed it like the factory to fit properly around
&gt; the hinges. If so, how!!!!!

&gt; &gt; First of all, Happy New Year to all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me any advice on aligning the doors on my 67 Sundial?  I
&gt; &gt; replaced the drivers side door, since the bottom hinge was tearing off
&gt; &gt; of my old door.  In the process, I guess I now need to re-align the
&gt; &gt; door.  Actually I need to do both doors, I think.  Putting the new
&gt; &gt; weatherstripping on has made it about impossible to open and close the
&gt; &gt; doors without slamming them.
