&gt;&gt; I dont know how original this would be, but if I were doing the wood
&gt;&gt; slats, I would use Mahoghany.

Mahogany is quite soft.  I would not expect it to last.  Maybe you mean
Teak?  Teak is used a lot in boats and is very rot resistant.

A quick survey using google, I came up with Beech (which would be very good
for the slats), Oak is also listed on several sites as being from Germany
which means Ash should also be available.
