Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene
  Berg dipstick ...

&gt; We're having trouble with temp creep in hot weather in our 62 with the
&gt; 1776 motor. But from all that's said about speed and temp, maybe we
&gt; just need to accept driving slower in hot weather. We had to keep
&gt; around 55 mph to keep temp under 225 last summer.

I have the same problem w/ my 63 DC - 1776 w/ heavy duty valve springs, 9.1
compression ratio, no external oil cooler, 30 wt. Oil, &quot;big small nut
tranny&quot; etc.

Tom Buese- engines, can't drive w/ em, can't drive w/o it.
