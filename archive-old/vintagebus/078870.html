Subject: radio speaker

Hi Folks,
Hey, I was wondering if someone could help me out.
I'm currently working on a stock radio installation for my 1963
deluxe. It's recommended for a stock speaker (which fasten's to the
original style bus speaker mount) that I use a 6&quot;, full range, 8 OHM
speaker. My local car audio place didn't have such an animal.
He states he only sells in pairs anyway. Can someone point me in
the right direction to get one of these guys? Maybe somewhere in the
Seattle /everett area or perhaps a mail order specialty house?
Thanks in advance!
Mike Turner
