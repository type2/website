Subject: Intro to List

Hello, this is Robert.  I'm new to the list, and thought I should introduce
myself.

I don't own a Bus yet.  I joined this list to determine which style bus I
want.  I'm
not up to speed on all of the acronyms yet, but know it'll be a &quot;splitty&quot;.

I live in Albuquerque, NM, USA, where old vehicles seem to last forever.  I
like
working on cars, although I don't consider myself a mechanic.  Hope I don't
get
hammered for this, but I'm kinda a Datsun freak.  I have two 67 Roadsters, 
a 74 260Z, and my daily driver is an 83 280ZX.

I'm enjoying the Hippie &amp; SO threads.  I'm 45 and I've been with my SO for
22 years.
She likes cars, but was somewhat hesitant about buying a Bus, til I took her
to some
of the links I've seen on this list.

Nuff said, later...Robert (Bus-less for now)
