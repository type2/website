Subject: New house guest HELP

  Looks like I am getting a couple new guest at the shop. 2 guys from
Switzerland in a 79 Westy. They bought this westy in Cali and were headed to
Canada then New York when they had an engine problem in Needles, Cali. One
of them is a certified Swiss mechanic so I am going to let them pull and
rebuild the top end of their engine here. Wish them luck.
  If anybody would like to meet them along their journey p-mail me and I
will give them your phone number and address.
  I do not know their exact route yet and will post it to all list while
they are here. Very nice people on a across the U S and Canada tour (in
winter?)
  When they leave here they are going up to Canada, then Alaska, then east
to New York. I hope they will get to meet some of the great people on these
list during thir trip. I am also going to print out the Airs list for them.
