Well, I picked up the 3rd of three VWs I was getting off of one person. This 
is the bastared camper or maybe its just a low grade one, but its the one 
with the funky little side privacy tent and both type seats in the cargo 
area. The back lay forward to make a bed. I did find a couple cool things in 
it though. I found a small Westy 6v lamp(saw a picture of one on the 
vintagevw_dot_com page). I found a period   style 6v hand held flood light and 
some I guess, home made screens to put into the front door windows when they 
are opened. Also found a leather strap (no, not a for kinky purpose) that is 
used for shapening your straight razor blade while camping. There is also a 
shifter extension and some kind of oddball ignition switch setup thats 
bolted onto the sterring column.

Anyways, the M-codes on the plate (pictured on the site) are:

056  072  216

I would think there would have been more if this was a true hardtop Westy, 
but maybe thats it. I still need to look them up unless someone knows by 
heart what they are.

Pictures of the thing are at this site. I did get the tent poles, but not 
the canvas yet. Its still stored(thank goodness) inside of their house 
someplace. The pole bag is in quite good shape even though it was laying 
inside the bus all these years. So check out the pics and tell me I should 
rebuild this FINE vehicle *cough*....excuse me.
