Subject: Re: [VB] Lug nut taps and dies...

what about buying a &quot;thread restorer&quot; kit, which does not cut new threads,
but cleans up existing ones?
i have use these with good results. anyone else?


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; If you really want to buy taps for suspension parts you need to make sure
you 
&gt; buy taps of nominal or smaller size.  What you want is to retain the
&quot;Class A 
&gt; Fit&quot; of the threaded items or risk them loosening from vibration.  Class
C 
&gt; Fit threads allows one to freely spin in the nut or bolt.  Class B Fit 
&gt; threads does not spin freely, but can be hand turned easily.  Class A Fit 
&gt; threads really needs a wrench to turn easily.  You need a 14 x 1.50mm tap
for 
&gt; bus lug bolt holes in the drum.  Get HS or HSS marked (High Speed Steel)
only 
&gt; taps!  They last two to three times longer than plain carbon steel taps
and 
&gt; have far better tolerance ground.....................................
