Subject: 1500 bus muffler... Urgent

Hi All,

It looks real positive that I will have a fresh 1500 motor for the tipper in
time for the octo/classic weekend.  I gave up on getting the double cab done
since I'm still waiting for some og bed slat screws I found (I'm just
waiting for them to be pulled from the donor) and those 5x12mm Kamax splash
pan bolts continue to elude me.  Actually, I do have two but there is a well
known westy out there with some horrible no name bolts used to hold the
splash pans on and I'm trying to do my part in making it presentable ;-)

Anyway, I've found some nice original paint tin (thanks Ronnie) for this
1500 motor and all the rest of the parts to put together a *correct* motor.
This motor won't be some shiny new paint thing but rather original and
looking like it should be in the tipper.  The one item I am missing is a
good muffler.  Anyone have one or know of a german VW one available?

I'm also interested in hearing from any of you with nice original fan shroud
and pre heat tubing.

TIA
