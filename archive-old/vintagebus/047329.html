&lt;&lt; Hi all, 
 
 New to this list!  I have a few questions to pose to the experts here.  I 
 looked at a 66 bus for sale near me.  It's real straight, has rust but not 
 terminal rust.  No accident damage.  It originally is a camper of some sort. 
 
 However, the interior is missing rearwards of the drivers seat.  It has the 
 exterior electrical outlet in front of the rear wheelwell on the driver's 
 side.  It has 3 crank-opening windows (horizontal pieces) on each side with 
 approximately 1/2 inch wood trim around them on the inside.  It is not a 
walk 
 through and has the cab divider.  No pop top.  Would this be a Sundial 
 camper?   &gt;&gt;

behind the passenger seat is a little 2 &quot; x 3&quot; tag,  write down everything 
just as it is on the tag, and go to that website to decode it (someone help 
here with where you can decode it?  vintagebus?  NEATO?)   on your VIN, the 
second number is the model number, if your VIN is 236 xxx xxx , the 3 means 
kombi, which is what westys tended to be made from.   If it is 216 xxx xxx, 
it means you bus was originallyt a panel, which most of the US camper 
companies usede to make into campers.  The non walk through panels have three 
vents up by the roof right at the back on each side.  the third digit of the 
VIN (find VIN on tag on side of air vent) is 6 for 66 model year buses.    
THe first digit is 2 for type 2s.  Hope this helps.
