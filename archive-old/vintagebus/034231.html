i did respond to the front splash pan question and quoted you a price 50
dollars plus shipping, in which i haven't heard a response from you on that.

and yes i have been slow on some things, but almost losing my shop to fire,
many computer upgrades and changes in my e-mail programs haven't made life
easy.

i am not and don't want to be like Wolfgang, Wolfsburg or any of the other
mail order firms, i like the personal touch and love searching for those
weird used parts, and i do belive in phones.

i have the splash pan, but no 67's, i have a complete used under nose piece
that i just cut off a bus.

after tomorrow my warehouse will be closed down for remodel but i will still
be shipping small parts and easy to box parts.

ps, in moving more things out of the warehouse i came across what i belive
to be a 67 only belly pan, it doesn't have the dip like my other 10 and is
cut out to allow for the longer 67 master culinder.

&lt;&lt; we are sorry to say that the warehouse will be shut down for a period of

 days (approx.)
 we will still be able to ship small items out of the showroom, but no sheet
 metal, doors or &gt;&gt;

Well, that's great! Not only can I not get a reply to my numerous messages 
regarding the availability and price of a front under cab splash pan and 
other items for my '67, I couldn't get it shipped anyways!
