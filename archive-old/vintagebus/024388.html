Subject: Re: heater exchanger tubing 

I was at the local junkyard recently and got a pair of mid 70's Bug heat
exchanger tubes.
They are 17&quot; long, convoluted plastic with a wire mesh liner that has
some sort of insulation in the mesh (hopefully not asbestos).  The ends
are 2 3/4&quot; dia and one end has a rubber reducing ring to make it 2 1/2&quot;
dia. Don't know if they will fit my '67 Kombi, but they looked
interesting and were only a few bucks. All of my heater ducting looks
original and needs replacing. If these will fit I might be able to get
another set next week when I go back to the yard. I'm still collecting
parts for a doghouse conversion. What are the pod things you mentioned?
Mine look like there are just hoses from the exchanger to the metal
tubes that Y together to run to the front.
