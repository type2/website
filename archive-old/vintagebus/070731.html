Subject: GL4 was: Parts stores

I remember reading a thread that discussed gear oil for trannys. The tread
said something about GL5 shouldn't be used for VW trans because eats the
brass synchros or something like that.

I talked to Rick Long about this and he said this was not the case. He said
that GL5 was the only oil you could use _if_ your brass parts were moly
coated. However VW brass parts are not moly coated and therefore GL4 or GL5
is fine.

Is he right or wrong?

&gt;I'd buy one at a schucks/kragen's/checkers.  cheap, have a lifetime
&gt;guarantee, stores everywhere in the country, keep you receipt.

Those stores seem to be mostly in the western half of the US:

Advance Auto Parts is apparently part of the same company, but I don't
know if they honor Schuck's/Kragen/Checker warranties or vice versa.
They seem to be mostly in the eastern half of the US:

Around here (OK/MO/KS/TX/AR), O'Reilly and AutoZone are fairly popular.
O'Reilly is mostly in the midwest and south central states:

AutoZone has pretty decent nationwide coverage:

oreLocator

NAPA seems to have locations nationwide, but their locator doesn't show
a general map.  Their stuff seems to be a bit spendy, but usually pretty
good.  (They are a good place for GL-4 gear oil.)
