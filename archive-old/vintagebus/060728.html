&gt; I figure the section of shift rod tube I pull out can be welded back

Hi Rex,
That will not do!  Cutting a section out will only make a lumpy area if you 
do not realign the pieces perfectly and/or when you weld it back together 
with welding drippage inside to lock up the rear shift rod bushings from 
passing through.  Plus you are very unlikely to completely weld it shut up 
against the body so to allow water/rust back in which should have been kept 
out by the rubber boots on either end of the rear shifter tube in the first 
place.  We would raise up the front of the bus on jack stands, put a plastic 
bucket under the rear of the shift tube and pour phosperic acid through every 
half hour till the rear shift rod comes loose.  The only other way we can see 
it working is to cut out the entire rear shift rod tube and weld in an entire 
donor tube from a simular year bus.  You can not use a rear shift rod later 
than chassi # 835 088 (SEPT61) if you bus is earlier than this!  BTW what is 
your chassi number?
