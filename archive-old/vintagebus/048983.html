Hi everyone,
 If your looking for wheel trim rings, you might want to try looking in your
local &quot;House of Used Hubcaps&quot; where I've been lucky in locating some.  Busses as
well as early Karman Gias with 15&quot; wheels used em (I'm not sure what else did). 
Once in Tucson I stopped by to inquire about some original hubcaps to restore
for my bus, and was taken to the back to look through their VW hubcap
collection.  In the corner of the room they had a rather large pile of
miscellaneous wheel trim rings.  I asked if I could dig, and lo and behold they
had 6 of the Volkswagen variety.  4 were perfect 15 inchers (stamped 58 on the
back) and  the other two were semi-good condition 14 inchers  (stamped 65 and
64).  They had no idea of a price, so I paid my 20 bucks for all of them and
left.  Can we say SCORE!

I suggest trying there first, ya never know they could be right there under your
nose the whole time.

I have been searching for 15&quot; trim rings for my '63 deluxe for quite
some time, with no luck.  I met a guy at the Jerome Jamboree that told
me that the non-ribbed 15&quot; trim rings from a 1949, 1950, or 1951 F*rd
are almost exact duplicates.  I bought a set from Vintage F*rd Parts and
just got them this evening.  They fit very nice and look real good. They
are made of Stainless Steel  (not aluminum like original) and have a
very good polish.  Without a set of VW rings to compare, I can't see a
difference.

Here's a picture (big file for detail):
