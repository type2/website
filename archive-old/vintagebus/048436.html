Subject: Re: to drive or not

I drove my 60 Crew Cab as my only driver for years, that included lots of
4+hour freeway cruises to Seattle and back. For lots of freeway work a big
nut tranny is a must. A freeway flyer is even better but I would agree with
hills and a stock 1600 you do too much shifting. Like anything if you
maintain it well it will be really reliable and you can fix most ailments
on the side of the road. Most bay windows are more comfortable to drive
(not that I would be caught dead in one), but the coolness of a splitty far
out weighs the comfort of a bay window.
