Subject: Replacing pistons and cylinders  wasRe: [VB] Piston Pin Bushing

Hi Mike,
You can replace the P&amp;Cs without cracking the engine case, and even the 
connecting rods and thier crank throw bearings.  The problem is if your engine has 
not been running a full flow oil filter system since the last rebuild then the 
main bearings will be worn and probably will give out soon after.  All 
because you put in the new P&amp;Cs causing an increase in HP and torque on worn 
bearings now used to lower HP and torque from tired not as well sealed and so less 
compression P&amp;Cs.
