&gt;Anyone know what the code 372 is, it's not really explained on the 
&gt;list at Type2_dot_com? I think the code may have something to do with
&gt;an extra switch on the dash. to the right of the headlight switch
&gt;there is another switch that looks factory. 

If you have the Bentley manual, look at page E-13-2.  They show
the emergency light switch as being to the right of the headlight
switch, on the right side of the cluster.  This book really only
covers August '62 and up Buses ('63 models) but yours may be
similar.
 
&gt;After switching it on I heard a dull buzzing sound from under the 
&gt;dash, I went out and looked and saw both front directionals were 
&gt;on but not flashing (signals dont work).  I guess this is some
&gt;kind of emergency flasher system?

I think you're right.  The buzzing is probably the flasher relay -
it's either not working, or possibly coping with a short to ground
in the turn signal wiring.  It also could be the hazard light
relay.  From the wiring diagram at VintageBus_dot_com, it looks like
the dash switch connects the rear lights and the coil of the hazard
light relay directly to the turn signal flasher.  The front lights
are fed from the fuse box through the hazard light relay contacts.
It looks like this was done so that the turn signal flasher only 
ever &quot;sees&quot; the load of two lamps at any one time.  It also looks
like that if you stepped on the brakes with the hazards on, both
the front and rear lights would come on solid.

The turn signals have to be working for the hazard flasher to
work, so fix the turn signals and you may find the hazards then
work too.

I hope this helps!
