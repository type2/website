For those of you who have checked out the infamous barndoor bus from the
recent SOTO meet( http://ebus.simplenet_dot_com/temp/choptop.jpg ) here is a
question. Can anyone identify the red camper in the background? It looks
suspiciously like the '63 mystery camper. Not only did it leave the factory
as a panel but it has those same exact style of popout window on the drivers
side. I have compared with the Sundials and EZ's on the type2 site but none
have those same windows.

'72 bus
