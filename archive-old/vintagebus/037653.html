&gt; Just wondering if anyone else is tired of all of the self-absorbed trip
&gt; reports and &quot;look what I found today&quot; postings.   Seems that this list
&gt; has the potential to be much more useful..
&gt;
As one of the periodic posters of trip reports, and a fan of reading others, I
feel as though I should defend them. I personally enjoy reading about other
people's bus-related escapades...I can empathize with the person changing a
clutch cable in the rain in the middle of nowhere, or the joy of seeing a
splitty in someone's back yard. I think it helps encourage other people who
aren't as confident in their vehicles also. To read about someone's 3000 mile
trouble free trip in a 30+ year old vehicle is also inspiring.
  Now granted, I don't care if someone found a set of hubcaps at a yard sale,
or drove their bus 20 miles to the mall or something, because that's pretty
common. However, if someone scored a bus tent for $25, or drove their bus 2000
miles, then that could be something that makes me say&quot; wow, cool...good things
do happen.&quot; If I was down about a problem with my bus, and I read about someone
else doing great things with theirs, that would lift my spirits a bit.
  Of course another caveat is that these things be well written. I don't want
to read 2 pages of &quot;drove bus today. I done drove it real far. I buyed 4
things. cool! bitchin!.&quot; If nothing else, well-written bus-related literature
can be enjoyed by a good many people. I myself always try to post reports and
such on Fridays, when the tone is less technical anyway.
  As for the potential to be *more* useful, what more are you asking for? I've
been around since the third month or so of the list, when it was all us type
II's together, and seen it grow and split off, mainly for the purpose of
keeping things more relevant and &quot;useful&quot; to specific years of busses. While I
do miss a lot of the family from older lists, I'll agree that I don't care as
much to read about Eurovan parts or driving around with a wasserboxer. However,
I think travelling in splitties is great, and I enjoy reading about others who
do that. Likewise, Finding old busses in weird places is also cool, to me, and
I like to read about that as well...
  I think that as long as it's all well managed, and doesn't overrun things,
it's a good thing. For example, I plan to cheer for Dave Easterwood as he
drives a barndoor cross country. I look forward to hearing the details, as
that's something that very, very few people will be doing this year.
   Anyway, I just wanted to insert my 5 cents worth, as no one else has spoken
up in defense...
Happy Friday
