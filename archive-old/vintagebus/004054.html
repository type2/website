Subject: Carb Jet Units of Measure

    As I've been fiddling with the jetting on my Weber ICTs, I began to
wonder about the size numbers stamped on them. . .  for 17 years I've never
given a second thought to what actual size those numbers represent.  What
unit if measure do the numbers represent??  Would a &quot;52&quot; idle jet represent
a hole of .52mm, .052&quot; or some other type of measurement??  In the end, I
guess it wouldn't really matter one way or the other, but I'd still like to
know the answer.
