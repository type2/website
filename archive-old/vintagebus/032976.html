Subject: gas tank barrier....

Dear List,
When I cleaned out the innards of my s/c  treasure chest, and removed
the gas tank barrier panels, there was a fiber-like inner panel on one
of them.  The other one was missing.  What are they made of....are they
available anywhere?  Is it composed of asbestos?  If so, is there an
acceptable replacement in case the original material is no longer
available?  Is it something that I could find locally?
Thanks,
Susan
