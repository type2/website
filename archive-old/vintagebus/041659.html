A lot.  d=2r    which means that the diameter is twice the radius.

&gt; from ground contact to the center, you will find that the

sure will.

&gt; Your engine RPM will be dictated by the radius not the
&gt; diameter.

Not quite.

The speed of the engine will be dependant on the .rolling circumference.
of the tire, not the diameter, or radius.

If you measure around the tread, from one spot, all the way around to that
same point, you will find, no matter HOW flat the contact section of the
tire (assuming all internal belts are intact, of course..), the distance
around the tire is exactly the same.

Now, if you heat the tire, and spin it at a decent speed, it _dot_can.
stretch. a small amount. Moreso with a bias ply tire then with a radial.
(the steel belts require more to stretch then the nylon and polyester
belts in the bias ply tires).

But we are talking insignificant figures.

C=2*pi*r  or C=pi*d

using  mph = (rpm * cir in ft) / (gear * final * 88)

C1=6.54ft=78.5in=2*12.5*3.14=circumference using the radius you gave. you
gave.
C2=7.09ft=85.09in=3.14*27.1, 27.1=2*6.05+151 20.5*.75=15.375cm=6.05in=aprox.
   sidewall height, 205/75R15

so,

S=(4000*C)/(.82*(3.88*1.26)*88)

S1=26160/352.78=74.15mph
S2=28360/352.78=80.39mph


So, if you want genuine accuracy in your geraing in your calculations, fo
out and measure the .circumference. of your tire for use in your formulas,
not some arbitrary diameter. (and i still havent figured out what the
&quot;diameter of radius&quot; is...
