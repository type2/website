Subject: Re: [VB] My buses are going up for sale

I hate to say but I have no complaints! My fiancee understands that I have been doing this for 12 plus years and that I will ever stop. As a matter of fact, at the last show we went to she decided she wants a single or double cab! My only complaint is that I might lose garage space!
