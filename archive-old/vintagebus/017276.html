Well, yes.  I was using short-hand for &quot;the reserve valve in the
normal position&quot; and &quot;the reserve valve in the reserve position&quot;.
Since, in theory, the two pickups are at different heights, they are
effectively different heights (although you can get some crossover due
to inclines and such).

This assumes:

- the valve is installed correctly, such that pulling the control knob
  out switches to the reserve pickup tube
- the two pickup tubes are the stock lengths

I was really hoping someone had a copy of the user's manual from a
similar-era bus that told what size the tank was, and how much the
reserve is, by which it's easy enough to determine the size of the
main reservoir.  Given that I took 10.24 gallons out while in the
&quot;main&quot; position, and given my understanding that it's roughly a
ten-gallon main tank (not to mention the volumes various people have
reported today), I have some concern about one or both of the above
assumptions being incorrect at this time.

The problem with draining the tank into calibrated containers (as at
least one person suggested) is that there's lossage due to spillage,
it's hard to get accurate volume measurements with most multi-gallon
gasoline-safe containers, and you don't really know how much you're
starting with unless you fill the tank and then drain it while still
at the gas station (I suppose you could drain it to the reserve at
home, drive to a close-by station, drain the reserve there, then see
how much you put in, but that's not likely to sit well with the
station owner).

As to those commenting on getting over eleven gallons in by tilting
the bus to the side, I have to say that this is true, but irrelevant.
I say that because as soon as you get the bus level again (or even
worse, park on the side of a road with a bit of a crown to it), all
that excess fuel will pour out the overflow tube.  Among other things,
this is not the safest nor most environmentally-friendly thing to do.
I'm wanting the working volume of the tank, not the maximum volume.

It sounds like the working volume is 10.5 or 10.6 US gallons.  This
makes that 10.24 number earlier even more suspicious with respect to
having reserve and main swapped, or both pickups at the reserve
height.

Thanks for the suggestions so far.
