&gt;...The lamp must go out when the gauge indicates pressure above 0.6 atm...
&gt;
Well, I pulled out the &quot;bad&quot; oil pressure switch tonight, turns out it says
0.8 on the side.  It is non-adjustable, dated 1964.  It is German but it is
not stamped VW so perhaps it is not correct for a VW engine?

In any case, I stuck my old one that I suspected of leaking back in.  I
noticed I still seemed to have a leak from somewhere on my engine so I think
some oil was coming up from the dizzy hole.  I checked that seal and it was
hard as a rock so in went a replacement seal on the dizzy shaft.

This &quot;old&quot; oil pressure switch is a screw-terminal, VW-stamped, 0.6-stamped,
and dated 1968.  I'll see what happens on my way to Bug-O-Rama on Saturday.
