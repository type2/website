	Protest gas prices?  Did we do that?
All I heard about was a few government mucky mucks getting all head up
cause it cost them $50 to fill up their Suburbans.  So they were going to
investigate this and see about bring charges of price gouging against the
oil companies.  Well as far as I can tell those people moved on to other
non issues after issueing statements that they didn't find any evidence to
support that claim.  They forgot to mention the free gas card that Shell
oil gave them.
	Gas just went up to about $2 a gal here in Northern California and I am
happy to pay it.  Sure it costs me $20 to fill up my bug but I get 2 weeks+
out of that tank.  I get tired of people here complaining about gas prices
being too high.  Look everywhere else.  They are higher.  Cheap gas is not
a God/ess given right.  We use way too much as it is.  I wish I felt safer
on a motorcycle.  
	Wow this is getting way too long and pointless as most people claim to be
environmentaly concious in principle.  In actuality they don't do squat.

&gt;It's going to be a bit of a damp squib if it doesn't get better by the
&gt;weekend as it's Vanfest in the UK and VWEuro in Holland, although the Dutch
&gt;are being a bit more mild-mannered about it so visitors to Euro should be
&gt;OK. I was planning to go to Vanfest but not now because I have no gas. In
&gt;fact I was forced to bike to work :-( 
&gt;
&gt;What exactly happenend when you protested about rising fuel prices over in
&gt;the US? Is there much of a difference in price between states? Just
&gt;interested in how it panned out.
