Yeh!

The withdrawals were getting bad. I was never one of the &quot;ten&quot; elite people
fortunate enough to get connected. Glad to have &quot;The Samba&quot; back at full
capacity. Well, I've gotta go and check out some picts on samba. I think I
will check out Thom's porn site too.

&gt;&gt; What happened to thesamba?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; It's back up now, although some work is still being performed.
&gt; 
&gt; I had it upgraded to double the amount of connections we can handle.
