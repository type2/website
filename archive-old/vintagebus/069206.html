Subject: back to say hi

Hello VB folks,

It's been a while since I made any contribution to the list. I've been on the 
digest mode for a long time and then unsubscribed due to being on the road. 
We're on the road still, currently in Washington D.C., and will swing back 
west sometime soon.

I would have remained 'underground' like the groundhog this year, not 
surfaced to greet the day, except I finally have time to catch up on the VB 
mails in type2_dot_com and found the SOS message sent out by Ronnie and kind 
words from fellow bussers. One cannot hide behind the screen when kindness is 
bestowed upon him... So here I am to thank you all publicly. Also I thought I 
should include a link to my journal entries, for those of you interested, to 
share my passage in the split-window bus. 

Sorry this was not done on a Friday. For techicality's sake: Like Beto said, 
a '71 auto-tran Bug starter moter works just dandy in the '66 bus. 

My sincere thanks to all who volunteered to help or chipped in 2 cents. Keep 
on bussin'...   
&quot;No bitching unless it's bitchin'!!&quot;

Ricky
