Subject: The Real Source show?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Are any of you guys going to the Real Source's show in Effingham, IL this 
weekend?
It's supposed to be pretty big and is a 2 day event. I'll be driving the B*g 
because We just can't get the '59 put together in time(We need a few more 
days).

Are any DBGer's going? If so, where are you guys camping?

Just a bit curious-Pete
