Subject: Mileage question... Stops versus distance

I drive my doublecab to a Cisco router class twice a week. I can take the freeway or surface streets. Freeway is 2 miles further, the surface street route has more stops, of course. Time is not a problem. 
My question... is there a formula or rule of thumb saying, &quot;X extra miles uses less gas than Y stop/starts&quot;.  Or &quot;one start/stop equals X miles&quot;. 
In my electric Thing, I'm well aware that it takes 70hp to get it off the line and up to speed. After the mass of the car is moving, it only takes 20hp or less to hold 40-50mph.
If we could come up with an easy to use &quot;formula&quot;, it should help with mileage. We can get pretty accurate route lengths from the mapping programs and a lot of trips are repetitive.
