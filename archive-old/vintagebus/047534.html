 This is almost what I need.  A couple of additional details would
 complete the picture:
 
 - what mpg do you usually get?
 - how accurate is your odometer?
 
 Thanks.

since I haven't driven the bus in a while, I forget what the milage tends to 
be- think it is a tad over 20mpg,   No idea how accurate the odometer is, but 
it made sense the 200 mile bit on long trips where I planned gas stops for a 
bit less that 200miles.

Did I add that the 59 i had (first split) had the reserve at 5 gallons?   It 
was kind of annoying.  Never tried to figure out why.  DOnt think it was 
supposed to be that way.

from a 55 (?)  (the cover page with date is gone, but the post bd bus has 
bakelite interior light bulb holders, and the wierd big cover intake 
manifold)  owners manual:

The tank has a capacity of 40 litres (10.6 U.S. gals., 8.8 imp. gals.) 
sufficient to drive for approx. 420 kilometers (260 miles)  The tank filler 
tube on thr right hand side of the vehicle is accesible by opening the cover 
with the square key delivered with the vehicle.

&lt;picture of hand opened the gas tank cover, has the all the way around seal 
for the cover&gt;

&lt;picture of fuel tap knob and its three positions&gt;

the fuel tap is operated by a push pull type knob from the drivers seat.  
Under normal conditions the knob should be push fully home.  The tap is then 
in the open position.

If the engine begins to &quot;stutter&quot; as a result of lack of fuel, just pull the 
knob fully out to switch the tap to &quot;reserve&quot;.  A fuel reserve of 5 litres 
(1.3 U.S.gals., 1.1 Imp. gals.) will then last for a further driver of about 
50 kilometers (30 miles).  It is important to push the knob fully home again 
when filling the tank, otherwise there will be danger of running out of fuel 
on the road.  With the knob pulled halfway out the fuel tap is fully closed.

....
so that is what the manual says it should be- dont think they changed the 
tank or fuel tap through 61.    your gas milage may vary from the about 
24-25mpg they describe.  your tap may be backwards or have a tube or two 
broken off.   My 61 operated very close to what that described.    though 
&quot;off&quot;  was a trickle.
