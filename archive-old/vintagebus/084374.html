Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene
  Berg dipstick oil temp sensor

227 may be ideal, but I don't know that it is realistic on a bus. I
hear a lot of 235 and even 265 on hot california central valley days.
I experienced thermal breakdown of the oil at 280 with Valvoline 20-50
racing oil.

You mentioned head temps of 300, which is really mild. 425 to 450 is
considered normal for a bus. Bear in mind the temp calibration of the
gauge which made to read at 70 ambient temp.

You can run synthetic oil to help your oil run cooler. Type 4 oil
cooler and larger pulley (or toothed belt/pulley system) can help cool
you down. Yes, get your Hoover bit and do all else you can to seal
your engine compartment and cooling system. Make sure your fuel
mixture is not lean, but that would affect your head temp most.

&gt; Still not sure whether my bus is overheating or whether that's the way
 it is stock/old/cheaply-rebuilt.

&gt; I did 350 miles this week end with air temps between 70 and 100
 degrees. Bus loaded. Here are a few observations (in no particular
 order). Gene Bergo oil sensor (on at 227 degrees /off otherwise) and
 VDO heads temp gauge. Here &quot;getting hot&quot; = oil reaches 227 degrees.

&gt; 6) As long as the VDO head gauge remains below 300 degrees, the oil
 temp stays below 227 degrees. Anything warmer on the heads for a
 couple minutes and oil gets hot.
