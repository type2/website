NQ:

Several years ago I purchased an adjustable fuel gauge through VDO. I 
believe it is part of their Industrial Series (although it looks like a 
cockpit style).

My Baja is equipped with a 1968 Bus fuel tank installed inside the car in 
the area that the back seat would normally go. I use a stock 68 Bus fuel 
tank sender along with this gauge. Thinking back, I remember a lot of trial 
and error in the adjustment of the gauge to get it accurate. I adjusted on 
the pessimistic side so I would still have about a gallon of gas when it 
reads empty.
