I just put a freeway flier in my bus about a month ago and I've had it
out on two road trips now. I really like the results. I get 21 mpg now
instead of 18 and the engine runs about 20 degrees F cooler.

For the record, my engine is 1600 DP with a CW crank and dual weber 34
ICT carbs. That might be a little more hp than a stock 1600 DP, but it
isn't much more. I normally drive at 70 mph an the interstate except in
the summer when the oil temp gets too high. From what I've seen so far,
I think I'll be doing 70 this summer too.
