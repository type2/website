Thanks Steve,
 
Do you happen to know the wiring of it off hand?

There is a 12V equiv., I have one on my '65 DC and the 4 way flashers do 
work with it. You have to order it directly from a Bosch distributor. 

The Bosch part # is 0332 015 001. I bought it from Julianna Co, 
800-334-0476. 

It mounts a bit differently from the 6V equiv. The 6V piece grounds thru the

cap via a clip that mounts to a hole in a boss under the dash. The new piece

has a separate connector on the circuit board for the ground. Just run a 
jumper from this lug to ground.

&gt; It is best to change all relays to 12 volt since your bus was already 
&gt; converted.  This will result in relays that will last longer.  If you find

a 
&gt; source to 12 volt the E-blinkers relay tell us cause so far we have had no

&gt; luck finding that one!
