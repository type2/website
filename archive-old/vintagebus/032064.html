&lt;&lt;  It then had a layer of heavy fiber board screwed in (useing the interior 
panel screws) with the same diameter hole cut in the fiber board.  Then there 
is a fiber board insert that fits into the hole to cover it up.  This insert 
is double layered, with one layer fitting in the hole and the other larger 
keeping it from falling through. &gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Fiberboard would be way too dangerous if there was an engine fire.  Which 
would compromise the firewall that protects the passenger interior.
