The offical date I have been waiting for that. Next to BBB VI and Jerome,
BYOB is the #   #. Count me in again, first to arrive, 63rd to leave.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I got my tipper yesterday from Belgium.  The 6 hour trip (each way) up and
&gt;back over several mountain passes was mainly uneventful.  I started a new
&gt;web site for the truck and posted a few pictures on vintagebus_dot_com... just
&gt;search for 'David Mayes'  This thing has 'patina'!

And here I thought patina was one of those miniature 
accordions.  LOL  David, you made a pretty wicked score, man.  I've seen 
pics of the tippers on the web and it's definitely a rare bird.  If you 
ever consider coming down to NorCal for the Kelley Park Weekend in April, 
I'd love to see the tipper out at Bring Your Own Bus on 4/6/02!!
