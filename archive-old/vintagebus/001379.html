Subject: Lash caps OR Swivel feet AHA!

Well it has come to my attention via Jeff Martin via ICQ tonight that you
can run lash caps with stock adjustors or swivel feet  with no lash caps but
you don't do both.  Well no wonder I was havings problems prior to BNNTA
with valve clearance.  There simply is not enough room to run both because
if you do and somehow manage to get the valve geometry correct, you will
impact the inside of your valve cover with a rocker and punch a hole through
it.

I think I'll go swivel feet w/o lash caps first and see if I can get things
to work this way.
