Why not use a thicker 1/2&quot; plus felt. If you ever have to remove it, it's a
lot easier then the sprayon or dynamat. Plus the cost remains better than
the other two alternatives you have mentioned. Have &quot;felted&quot; my Westfalia
and it is now extremely quiet compared to what it was before

&gt; Getting close to finishing up my bus.  Anyone ever applied the sprayon
rhino
&gt; lining type stuff in the back of a bus to deaden the noise?  Dyna-mat is a
&gt; bit $$$$ and was looking at alternatives.  Whatever I use will have to fit
&gt; under the camper kit(was originally felt).
