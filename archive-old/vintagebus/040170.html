PROBLEM:
I made a post a few weeks ago requesting help regarding a Judson 
Supercharger kit on my 36HP  engine, I had asked for help on resolving an 
overheating problem- I got an excellent responses. Thanks!!! Now, though, I 
have a REAL problem. I believe that I ran the ingine for so long with it 
overheating that I have caused some internal damage,If you are an expert wit 
the 36HP engine Please read my post in its entirity and offer an  answer to 
my questions  posed in the last paragraph.

HISTORY:
I want to give a little history regarding this engine and the bus. The bus 
is a pre-March '57 standard(chassis # 199637) with the 36HP Judson kit 
installed by the dealer in '58. The original owner of this bus died in '59 
and the bus sat in a dirt floored barn untill '99. The bus/engine has 5,600 
original miles ( you read it correctly!), easily documented by the 
parperwork accompanying the bus, it even has an original GulfPride oil 
change/service sticker on the door post _at_3900 miles. This bus is 
remarkable-all original everything and complete down to the Continental 
tubes inside the continental tires. The steering and suspension are so tight 
its like driving a new bus.When I become more computer and internet literate 
I will post images.

JUDSON:
These are some facts that I've learned about the supercharger kits from 
Judson: The Judson kits were supplied with three CRITICAL small parts that 
were to be installed along with the lubricator,pump, pulleys, etc...these 
were: a stronger-than-stock fuel pump diaphram spring (to provide the carb 
bowl with a larger volume of fuel with each diaphram stroke),  larger MAIN 
and  smaller AIR CORRECTION  jets for the carb ( to provide the richer fuel 
mix for the supercharged engine).

FACTS:
Now for some details, I purchased the bus from the second owner,who 
originally spotted the bus and purchased it. He got the engine running and 
in doing so one of the things he replaced was the fuel pump. The original 
fuel pump was included in a box of parts that came with the bus when I 
purchased it. Of course, as the proud new owner of a cool bus I was anxious 
to log  some miles on the bus, but on the first outing I knew that something 
  was just not right in the engine, the primary sympton being the bus 
running very hot. It cranks, idles, accelerates beautifully but at high  
RPM's- just before shifting or anything above 50MPH (remember it is a 36HP 
in a pre-'59 type2) I got lots of high pinging sounds, rattling, and a 
significant flat spot. My gut feeling was that the engine was running very 
lean.

QUESTION:
Now for my questions: I was getting pretty upset not being able to figure 
out the overheating problem. I had been basically doing only short jaunts ( 
about 20-30 minutes) then parking it because it was very hot! Well, I got 
little longer, it got a little hotter, oil light on--I shut her down.
Next, I did the research on the Judson kits mentioned previously and it 
clicked, I remembered seeing that old, original fuel pump from the bus in 
that box of parts. I dissambled that pump, cleaned it up well and installed 
it--PROBLEM SOLVED. I mean what a difference! This thing sounds wicked now, 
and much less noise (pinging) and she cruised beautifully at 50-55 MPH 
without all that straining.
BUT,BUT,BUT, This is why I am crying, this is why I am posting this: Now 
after a good long jaunt the overheating problem seems to be non-existant but 
when she is at idle I have an internal engine noise ( a chattering/high 
pitched rattle) that I did NOT have before that last drive when I got her 
prety overheated. WHAT HAVE I DONE? Cam bores galled? Main bearings scored? 
The noise is not really loud but it is present. Engine performance is good. 
The oil light does NOT come on while driving or at idle.Should I continue to 
drive her or do I have to face tearing into this &quot;new&quot; engine??? Please give 
me come good solid advice.

PROFILE:
For what its worth this is me: I've been READING the list for about 18 
months but have just learned how to post (duhhh). The list is real cool! 
Born in '56, a vw addict since '75- I drive my VW's!!! and have never owned 
anything but an aircooled dub. Currently in the stall: '57 type 2 standard, 
'62 SC, '62 type 1, '64 type 2 panel, '64 type 1, '65 type 2 standard, '66 
21 window- ALL inspected and I drive 'em (you know I spend a lot of time on 
the concrete floor).

MORAL OF THE STORY:
For the List- If you intend to run a Judson, be aware of the fact that a 
change in carb jetting and that special stronger fuel pump spring  will be 
required in order for the Judson to perform as designed.I believe that some 
of the bad rap on Judsons may be due to the fact that INOMPLETE  kits have 
been installed.
For me- Stupid! Don't get so anxious! Still learning!
