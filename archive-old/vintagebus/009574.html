&gt;. My question is, how far is a round trip commute for you? I am
&gt;considering putting my '64 into commision for my driver, but my commute
&gt;is 65 miles round trip. Does that seem excesisive for a 35 (she was made
&gt;
&gt;in 63) year old vehicle?


Nah, it's not excessive.  I drive my 58  for a 50 mi. roundtrip 50 mph up
and down 3000ft. every day and it doesn't seem excessive to me.  Just leave
a little earlier in the morning and enjoy the ride.  I do park it in the
winter though to save it from salt.

John
