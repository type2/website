When?

I know of one place near Mt. Shasta by a rushing river (feeds into Lake
Siskiyou) that is easy, and free....locals apparently go there.  Also, if
you're in the Mt. Shasta area, go visit Castle Lake. (Let me know if you
want directions).  There's a free campground there, but at least would be
worth a day hike or something.  Sacred spot, that one!

If you want to drive far, there's a trip I've been meaning to take:  101
north to Gold Beach, Oregon, then there's this road right before the bridge
north of town that goes inland all the way to I5...back country the whole
way....really beautiful...I've only taken the first 30 miles.  Go over to I5
on that road, and then down to the Shasta area.

Also, you might check out the Smith River area in N. Cal.  Just north of
Crescent City.  The road through that area is pretty cool, also goes over to
I5, but is more mainstream.  Near a lodge (again, let me know if you're
interested) there's a dirt road to the left that goes along Patrick Creek,
and there are many (free) environmental campsites.  My favorite back there
is the junction of Patrick Creek and Helen Creek.  Makes a nice pool...very
secluded, but not too rough or anything.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I'm cross posting this to several lists so I can gather some needed
camping
&gt; ideas.
&gt;   What I want to do is go camping, not in a RV park but way out some dirt
&gt; road in the mountains where I can see some of mother natures beauty. I'm
&gt; looking for an area which doesn't impose on anyone's private property (
but
&gt; if you know of someone who wouldn't mind ) near Lake Shasta, Calif, or
&gt; southern Oregon. Katelyn (11) and I would like to take the Roadcow out and
&gt; spend some quality time together and enjoy the outdoors. I told her I'd
&gt; re-teach her how to fish and with the Westy we both can cook. We are open
to
&gt; and encourage anyone to join us on this fun low stress campout. Please
feel
&gt; free to send comments and suggestions. Hope to see many listees at the
&gt; Classic!
