Subject: Re: [VB] Vent windows!

If you mean the vent window glass doesn't stay in the frame, but &quot;sueezesz'
back out that 1/4 inch? If that's what you mean, it's a bear. But i put lots
of trim adhesive in the frame and take some rope or good twine and wrap it
around the frame and around the glass. Use a long screwdriver to apply a
tornequet to the fram and glass and twist until it is tight. Then wedge the
screwdriver in a good place and go to bed. In the morning it should stay
put. If not, do it 'till it does.

Subject: [VB] Vent windows!


&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; Workin' on changing door seals on my 63', and made the (mistake?) attempt
to
&gt; change the seals that border the vent window to the vent window frame.
Boy
&gt; o boy, lotsa fun!  I had new locks to put in, and cracked the lock in my
&gt; attempt.  I have it rigged enough to the point that if I can get the
window
&gt; completly in the frame, it should hold.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is, IF I can get the window COMPLETLY in the frame!  Right now
I
&gt; have it about 98% there, but it won't budge.  I have given it a rest for
the
&gt; night, thinking maybe after a nights rest, it will be more coperative.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone any experience with this dilemma?  I have tried using a bit of
&gt; soapy water already, and this did help to get it where it is.
&gt;
&gt; I'll try again tomorrow.....Just venting to an open audience.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
