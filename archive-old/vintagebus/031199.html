First what type of driving was it as eric and barb asked.
We do run hot on long runs more than an hour at 3000 rpms, hot days 85
plus degs, or hills 2000 ft plus climbs about 220 plus more as the
condition get worse (more of any of the above).
Today we had it out in 95 plus degs, 20 minutes or more runs, in town
(rural) 50 mph, with not over 170 degs. We have to be heat soaked (all
the parts in the drive train) before the temp goes up. 
Data full loaded camper, 1600 sp, 65 b/n trans, type 4 cooler, all tin,
all seals, 205R75 15 tyres, 2.2 to 1 gen. to pulley ratio, pict 30,
20-50 oil, rear relief valve sender vdo, 
As VW Howard said paraphrased we were happy before the *_at_*_at_**_at__at_ gauge 
P &amp; C
59 ddr w/t w 65 ez camper with a incurable heat problem


 I just installed an oil temperature gauge in my 66 ('71 engine w\1600
DP, 34 pict 3 carb, 009 Distributor, using 20W-50 oil). Anyway, after
driving for about 20 minutes in 70 degree weather, the gauge only reads
about 150-160 degrees. IS THIS POSSIBLE? I used the oil plug type
sender, so I realize I'm probably going to get the coolest reading from
this, but can it really be running that cool,
