Subject: Heater cable tube blockage issue

Hi all, I have something jammed (I assume its part of the old broken cable) in my left heater cable tube about 4 inches from the exit near the engine. I need to snake it out but am not sure what to use. My fish tape is too wide. Thought about buying a 10 foot length of copper wire but copper might be too soft. I really need something sturdy enough too put in a drill motor as I fear this is what I may end up doing. Any suggestions from prior experience?
   
  TIA
