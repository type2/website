Subject: double-thrust cam bearings

anyone have a new set of the nice copper-faced double-thrust cam 
bearings out there?
i have a mahle single-thrust set, and the cam bearings look like 
tinfoil; i have an older kolbenschmidt set, but they are for an 
oversized (alignbored) case ... 111-198-542 vs 111-198-541 ...
berg now is back to making you buy two sets to get double thrusts; 
hoping someone out there has a spare set and needs something i have 
to trade/sell.
otherwise, the old set (whch has seen 5K and a few bits of metal in 
the oil) will have to do....
