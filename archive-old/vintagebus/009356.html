[...]

No shortage of running splitties in Tacoma, either.  There are at least a
half dozen that I see driving regularly around our end of town, and another
~dozen that pop up from time to time.  The few owners I've spoken to in
recent years were unaware of the Lists and other 'net resources, and despite
being provided with the necessary info. I'm not aware of any that have
joined the VB List.

There's a running but pretty trashed splitty for sale only a block from my
house, and it's been on the market for at least a year.

Another [WARNING - non-splitty verbiage follows] unusual recent arrival in
our neighborhood is a single cab baywindow type 2.  The rear has the same
lights, etc., as our '70 bus, but the front has the late bay
parking/turn signal light arrangement.

FWIW.....

&gt; Maybe half dozen, no a
&gt; dozen splits around, large number of bays.  Seems all the split drivers
know
&gt; each other, but then again this is a small town and if you don't want
someone
&gt; to know what you are doing, don't do it, or don't care if they know.

what small town do you live in that has a DOZEN splitties driving around?
i'm the    only one in nashville that i've seen that actually drives. i know
a guy who has about six, but it's mainly just me and him, as far as i know.
i'm not doubting you, i was just curious.

...Oly WA,   which was evidently recently called the hippest town in the
west
by Time magazine or some such rag.   No clue why they did.   But yes there
are about half a dozen driving around I regularly see and half a dozen more
I
know drive but I dont see much (differnt schedules/ routes or their use as a
second car) as wells as more I know of that are yard art, barn art  or
&quot;about
to be fixed&quot;
