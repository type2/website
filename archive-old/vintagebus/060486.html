&gt; Since the shifter hole for a later bus is forward of the earlier one, is it 
&gt; safe to assume that the earlier shift rod is shorter than the later one?

Hi Steve,
You bet!  Rod - Gearshift, front up to Chassi No. 501 706  is definitely 
shorter resulting in the shifter being about three inches forward of the 
bench seat base!  Not certain, but the rear shiftrod might be shorter also.  
According to &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot;:  
8 AUG 59  Chassi 501 707  Hand levers
Now: Shift lever and hand brake lever repositioned 150mm forward  Improved 
leg clearance.  Shift lever lower end, dowel pin, spring and ball, hand brake 
link, hand brake cable and pedal floor board modified.
