Hello all

Just got home from BBBV last night and wanted to thank
all of the Havasu people who put on the event.
Man-O-Man what a long drive, about 1300 miles round
trip. The Bus ran perfect, always does!(stroke stroke
karma karma) 
Beto and I missed the Listee group photo while we were
towing back the broken down bus of Chris and Jen from
Phoenix. Beto drove his truck about 110 miles round
trip to tow in someone he didn't even know. Good job
Beto. 
I noticed that the famous Double Cab that has been
sitting next to the hiway in Goldfield NV for so many
years is gone. Anyone know who snagged that one and
the 58/59 bus from Mina NV??? Anyone anyone

Thanks all for a great time and see ya there next year
