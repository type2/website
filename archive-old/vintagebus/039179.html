Hello list

Here are some questions regarding fuel gauge and sender

What would cause the gauge in the new beetle speedo assembly I installed
along with a new lever and float type sender unit to give eratic
readings that seem to have no relation to actual fuel levels?    

Is the original 'tube' type sender unit that came with my '61rebuildable
and if so what tips are there out there?

Is the original gauge rebuildable? Is this a job best left to a pro? I'd
like to put the original system back together 'cause it was so accurate
I'd know when I had a kilometre or two left in the tank. When I first
got the bus I was always broke and because of the accurate gauge could
safely put in a litre here and there as I needed it. 

TIA

Michael
