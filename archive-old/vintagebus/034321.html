Hi Zac &amp; Jon,
Really the best way is to drill a small hole in the freeze plug and use one of
those cheapie body dent pulling tools with the screw tip.  Make sure you
scrape out around the plug with a knife first to remove as much crud from
around it and have extra screws to replace the tool tip if the screw in it
breaks.  We found that our tool has to have the replacement screw heads files
down in diameter to fit into the tool.  After the plug is removed have your
local welder seal the hole in the freeze plug and make sure you use plenty of
silcon sealant around and between the plug edge and the swing plate to seal it
totally.  Removing the axle is way more complicated including having to make
sure to insert the proper thickeness of seals between the tranny and the axle
tube to prevent to tight or sloppy fit of this area when reassembling.
