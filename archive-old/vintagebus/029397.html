This is the exact reason I initially subscribed...after being on just the T2 list
for a while.  Then...I got sucked into the splitty world faster than I realized.
Beware bay window guys/gals... the &quot;hobby&quot; can get out of control quicker than you
think...

I've asked many questions about my 71 on this list...and many of you didn't even
realize ;-)



As far as my engine situation goes...
I picked up a rebuilt 40 horse last night at a reasonable price...minus exhaust
and some tin.  I heard it run before I bought it...we started it up on the
ground... held some rags up to the exhaust..and gave it a listen.  The motor is
super quiet...no bearing noise or knocking or anything...it sounds super super
nice.   So...today I pulled out the old engine... and swapped some stuff onto the
40hp to convert it to 12V...and a few other things had to be switched.  I had a
little problem with engine tin...but did some modifications and it worked :)
Nothing extreme...just put a little lip on a piece that went under a head.  I need
to find a piece of 40hp front tin...I can't seem to find any in my stash...but
have piles of head tin.  I had problems with the carb hitting the generator since
i went to 12V...so instead of making another spacer (already did this with my 71)
I went ahead and installed a governor that I had lying around.  I've always wanted
to try one of these...and why not...since i needed a spacer anyways :)    I found
some 28PCI carbs...and would have gone with one of these ( I love manual chokes )
if my bus would have been one year or more earlier... so i just went with the
30PICT2 (square bowl) that was on my old engine... a rebuilt 30PICT1 (round bowl)
came with the 40hp motor...but i decided against it as it would have just been
more time changing jets and converting it to 12V and I've already taken care of
the brass fuel fitting on the top of the 30PICT2 and didn't want to mess with the
other today...

It'll be interesting to see the difference between the old 1500 and now the 1200
with a governor...  should be fun.  I might just end up taking the guts out of the
governor...or tightening it up so that it won't activate ...if i could do that.

So now all i need to do to the 40hp before it goes in is install 2 pieces of tin
...those being the breast tin (I found an early piece in my stash...so I'll use
that) and the piece of front tin...which I need to find tomorrow.  That, and I
need to beat the hell out of this muffler a little bit more.  The heater boxes
line up fine... and one of the manifolds lines up with the head nicely...and is
bolted on...but the other side doesn't want to go on (yes...it IS a 40hp muffler)
as it is just a hair off... so i'll have at it with a hammer some more tomorrow.

I also tried a different clutch on this engine... a 6 spring instead of the
&quot;finger&quot; clutch...  we'll see how that goes.

As for the old engine...I'm thinking of making a &quot;normal&quot; 1600 out of it...but
just using a stroker crank in place of the stock crank...  who knows...
that...and balancing everything... but time will tell on that.  That engine will
more than likely go into my new bus that I'll be getting after I graduate high
school this winter............

oh well...i think thats all for now?

&gt;
&gt; Since this comes up every now and then, I think I'll respond. This
&gt; list is not just home to split window busses, but also to early bay
&gt; window busses. As you know, the early busses use upright type 1 style
&gt; engines. So their owners come to the vintagebus list for engine tech
&gt; info, and might go to the type2 list for body stuff ect. '68-'71
&gt; busses for sale are perfectly on topic for this group in my opinion.
