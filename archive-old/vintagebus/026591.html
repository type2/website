Joshua,
My heat works with the same effeciency as Eric and Barbs.Though below 10F the
stock VW heating falls off dramatically.
I do have a set of curtains dividing front from back(makes a huge difference).I
have all the heater tubes
insulated and I repaired all the leaks and holes.Also make sure your door seals
are actually sealing out the cold air!!!
Is your belly pan in place and all the seals for the pedals ?Is your overhead
vent leaking?
Also make sure your heater cables are adjusted correctly so when you turn the
heat on you are actually opening the vents in the heater boxes completely!
Another way of keeping warm is to have a nice wool blanket over you while you
drive.When temps. dip below 10 degrees F, which they often do here in Chicago,I
run a electric heater on a timer out to the bus and have it timed to kick on an
hour before I leave for work.This gets the cab temps up to about 50 and my butt
doesn't freeze on the vinyl seat.I also have a leather steering wheel cover to
keep my hands warmer.
        Good Luck,
                            woody

ps. I have also found that the bus stays the warmest if you have the defrost on
just a little.This also allows you to point your fingers over the outlet while
you are driving,hence a built in finger warmer!!!

&gt; Hi Joshua,
&gt; What year bus do you have?  Do you have all the cooling tin on the engine in
&gt; place?  Are you running the thermostatic bellows to properly get the engine
&gt; to operating temperature?  Have you made sure all of the heater ducts are in
&gt; place and securely hooked up?
&gt;    We are driving our 1960 panel conversion with 1641cc single port out here
&gt; near you in the Seattle area and are comfy in about five minutes have to have
&gt; our coats off about ten minutes after starting to drive the bus from a cold
&gt; start outside.  We also want to install gas heaters for when the weather gets
&gt; down in the 20Fs and lower to help get the bus heated up sooner but have
&gt; driven in temps down to 10F and have been warm enough on trips longer than 15
&gt; minutes.
