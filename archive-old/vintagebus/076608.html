&gt; As writ:
&gt; &quot;How many people do you know that take thier bus on 12 hour plus cruises a
&gt; few times a year in addition to daily driving and multiple other medium
&gt; distance camping trips?&quot;
&gt;

Daily driver, almost 20K miles a year including about a half dozen 12-14
hour drives out of state! About once a month we do a 500 mile round trip to
visit family out of state in it.

The wife however, drives a waterpumper to work.
