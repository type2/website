Subject: Re: [VB] thinking of selling my bus- anyone have regrets?

&gt; Yes, I could drop $30K+ and have a totally reliable new Toyota, but much

&gt; incremental repairs I do have to make on my bus are far less than the

While I happen to completely agree with George's opinion on this for
many bus owners, there are other options than a expensive new car. For
the bus owner who has no desire to do his/her own repair and
maintenance finding a mechanic gets harder and harder everyday.
However it's very easy to find shops that can work on 10 year old
hondas and such other imports. If the owner will be paying for labor
either way, there is no savings for them in this case. Some people
will just plain be better off selling the bus now (while prices seem a
bit inflated) and purchasing the most sound vehicle for their uses
possible.

Myself I prefer &quot;the devil you know&quot;. I know some things will break on
my bus from time to time, and maintenance is much more of a regular
issue, however I know it front to back. When I have issues I know what
to check for weak links. Like George said, when in decent shape (and
in spec) these buses work wonders. After all, do you really think VW
would have been sucessiful selling them if they all just plain were
horrible?
