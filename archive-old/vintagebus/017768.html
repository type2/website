I haven't seen him on the web for a while.
has anyone? 
oh and OT
I still haven't found a rebuilt 6v starter for less than $60
I need an extra for my test bench for a few of my
spare motors. I don't want to pull the one off my 
kombi (it works fine ) so I don't have a core.

thanks to paul kagel for recyler_dot_com

I searched under &quot;auto parts&quot; for &quot;6v vw starter&quot;
 and got the search  result data at the following URL

http://www.recycler_dot_com/asp/AdDetails.asp?iID=63057&amp;sBAC=818&amp;bSQ=0

The area code is Canoga Park  any list members there?

keep on dubbin

Ken
