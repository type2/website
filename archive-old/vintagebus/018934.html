I am still 6volt, and a lot of people have tried to convince me to switch to
12v, I have considered it at times-just so I could have some accessories, but
now I have a voltage converter so should be no problem.

as for a 6v 200mm flywheel-they are difficult to find. I heard gene berg ent.
has them or try ronnie.
