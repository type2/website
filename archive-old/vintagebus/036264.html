&lt;&lt; &gt;Well you could always recalibrate, and reset it!  Just like the VW 
dealerships used to do.  Eric&amp;Barb &gt;
 And I would do that how?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Here below is the info from the 1959 VW bus workshop manual.  This info is 
for screw terminal oil pressure switches only!   Eric&amp;Barb
______________________
The oil pressure switch can be adjusted by means of special testing equipment 
(Fixture can be made to use air pressure, and mechanical pressure gauge.) or 
on engine, by a simple testing device with a pressure gauge (drwing VW 662/2 
for local manufacture) and a test lamp, after the engine has attained 
operating temperature.  
1. - Screw oil pressure switch into the testing device.
2 - Screw testing device into seat for oil pressure switch and connect one 
lead of the test lamp to the oil pressure switch and the other lead to 
terminal 15 at the ignition coil.  The test lamp should then light up.  
Otherwise, turn the adjusting screw (just inside of the screw for the wire 
for the pressure idiot light) clockwise with a screwdriver.  If the lamp does 
not light up, the switch is defective and must be replaced.
  3 - Start engine.  The lamp must go out when the gauge indicates pressure 
above 0.6 atm.  (8.5 lbs/sq. in.).  Below this pressure the contact should be 
closed and the lamp on.  With the engine cold, the lamp should go out at 
normal idling speed, and with the engine warm it should go out as the speed 
increases.  If the lamp goes out too late, the adjusting screw must be turned 
anti-clockwise.
 4 - Stop engine.  There may be a slight delay before the lamp lights up, as 
the oil pressure decreases slowly.
  Apart from this adjustment, nothing can be done to the oil pressure switch.

Note:
From Chassi No. 614 456 (June 1960) all transporter models are eqquipt with 
non-adjustable oil pressure switch (Part No. 113 919 081)
