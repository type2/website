Here is a tip I learned from my good buddy: the late, great Josh Rodgers.
12volt to 110volt power inverters will run a boom box all weekend! You can
get a small one for around $50. I run a large boom box with cd changer and
can't hardly tell any battery drain at all! They also work great for hair
dryers, trouble lights, small tv's etc.

&gt; Damn, that's a lot of work!  I would have taken the boom box apart, found
out where the batteries sent their power and soldered in a couple of wires
to  feed out the back. Once out the back you can wire in a cigarette lighter
connector or more length to fit to the fuse box, or whatever you're
connecting to.   Get a solar panel from Harbor Freight &amp; get free sound.
