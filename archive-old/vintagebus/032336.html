OK! as long as big buck prices are the norm, count me in!!!!
I'll take $20k or best offer on the 1954 Ambulance Barndoor camper.
Comes complete with five new 16x7.50 Nankang bias plys and tubes, rarest of 
the rare *real* OEM barndoor safari windows, Optional fresh air scoop and 
two-speed ambo fan, ambo glass divider, spare set of large logo glass, bad 
assed Bosch driving lamps mounted on the proper ribbed bumper, has correct 
reflectors and early bubble tail lights and rear ribbed bumper. Cool old 
school tow hitch is mounted under the rear bumper. Don't think that it is a 
Westfalia hitch but it is cool as hell. New rebuilt heads &lt;Mike Fischer 
Engineering&gt; on the industrial numbered 36hp hand crank engine, hand crank, 
semaphores, spare pair of semaphores and a full tank of gas. Home built 
camper kit is cool for what it is. Driven from Phoenix, Arizona to the 
Irvine, California VW Classic/OCTO weekend and back in June 1999. Intending 
on taking it out on Saturday or Sunday to a local Octoberfest. Can be 
delivered to the upcoming OCTO or Pomona for the right price. See pictures 
on Everett's VW Planet &lt;thesamba_dot_com&gt; TypeII photo section/Barndoors/Page 5.
Contact me if you are serious! Otherwise I'll keep it...
