Well I'm not trying to nail this down to whether or not you have chrome
valve stems on your tires.  Just the basics.  As for the coding, well its
allready there and dictated by my client who assumes he is gonna be dotcom
rich a week after i hand it to him..  Options are not mandatory to submit
the form so whoever places the add can list it as a car, or add a story of
how they made it to 3rd base in it back in 63' if they want.  My point was
that after messing with nearly 60 pages of code, i thought i could take the
easy way out and make sure i dont forget anything.  Its part of the beta.
It also helps me make sure ive crossed all my T's and dotted the I's when i
hand the final app over to my client.

There are literally hundreds of options.   Hundreds.  And odd combos 
thereof.

This is the biggest problem I have with the new &quot;ebay motors&quot; site;
they try to compartmentalize all cars to a rigid set of definitions.
It was a pain in the ass trying to list my '55 - I had to enumerate
the transmission type, *mileage* (who freakin' cares, it's 45 years old!),
interior and exterior color, etc.  Other classifieds I've seen try to
capture too much info, which makes it a PITA for the users.

&gt; Hey everyone.  Im developing a Classifieds/Auto Sales app here at work and
&gt; figured I'd apply the Beta to VW's..  (and why not?!!)  This app is gonna
&gt; work alot differently than anything you've seen so far on the other
&gt; classified sections on sites so i need some advice.  The biggest thing is
&gt; options for vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; When placing a listing for a vehicle the listee will choose from a set
list
&gt; of options as well as having a write in box.  Everyone start naming off
all
&gt; the options i should include relating to VW's (ie sunroof/ragtop, popouts,
&gt; engine sizes, and so on)  After 2 weeks of coding I'm almost ready to
&gt; release this thing but my head cant hold anymore info so i need all the
help
&gt; i can get so i dont overlook anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, since this wont be a commercial effort for the VW beta, i have all
&gt; kinds of advertisement sections available for FREE!!! to any of you with
&gt; business' relating to repair, part sales, insurance, VW dealersship or
&gt; resellers.  Also, i do have a banner space for vw hobbyist sites too.  2
&gt; sizes for the banner 145x87 if anyone wants to submit one. and the usual
&gt; 468x60.
