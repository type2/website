Subject: RE: Clutch Troubles

Thanks to all who supplied info on my clutch troubles.  I'm gonna pull
the engine this weekend and see what I can see.  Unfortunatly I have to
wait until then as this is a daily driver bus, about 30+ miles to work
and back.
    On an unrelated note, I noticed a thread awhile ago that dealt with
speedometer/odometer discrepencies.  I've used a stopwatch on a nice
straight stretch of road and found my speedo is almost dead on at 60mph,
but the odometer takes 93 seconds to click a mile at 60mph.  This is a
speedo I've frankensteined together from the broken original and a
broken clear needle speedo.  My question being, is there a difference
between the odometer guts in these two speedos? I think there might be
but I can't tell just from a visual inspection.
    Also, does anybody know a good metalworker in the Ventura-Santa
Barbara area I can trust with some repairs? If not, anybody have a
welder they want to part with?
