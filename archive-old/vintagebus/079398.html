Subject: Re: [VB] front spindle nuts and parts needed!  

ya the bay window spindle nuts that tighten with the allen bolt work on the 
64 to 67 spindles, and you don't have to keep getting the silly lock washers.  
Dunno what years they are from... I have extra spindle nuts if you want to go 
that way.

Hello, I am in need of both spindle nuts for the
driver side or my `66 single cab.  I need both of the
2 nuts for this side, these are `64-`67 and have the
left hand threads being on the driver side.  I also
need at least one of the passenger side spindle
nuts...these are proper right hand threads...heck will
just purchase all 4 nuts for both sides if anyone has
some.

I also heard that the early bubble window spindle nut
may work...the one with the allen head bolt for
tightening...? is that true...

Also have a buddy who just bought a `67 camper and
needs an entire driver side front spindle with nuts
also!  wow is that weird of what...

I wanna get my bus on the road so any help is
appreciated.

Thanks
Todd
