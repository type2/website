Since there was a safari thread going, I thought I might share some info
that came in the mail this morning from Creative Engineering over in
England.  They reproduce very close to original safari and pop out
windows.  BTW I have no affiliation with the company.

I inquired about dash tabs and wing bolts for a set of originals I'm
restoring.  They responded very promptly by e-mail and then sent off a
flyer and pictures of the complete set and the individual parts (sold
separately also).  All the parts seem to be of very high quality.  There
are a few things that are non original like the threaded inserts that
are on the mounting brackets that weld to the body.  The originals were
brazed-on 4 sided nuts while these are cylindrical, no big deal.  The
frame profile is correct as is the profile of the dash tabs.  The
latches look very close to original also.   I'm not sure if the frames
have the
inner structure that the originals have like Jason mentioned.  Overall,
the windows look very good.


Here is the text  of the flyer:

Safari Windows 1955-67 (I think they make Barndoor too)

&quot;The highest quality repro safaris available in the world!  Every part
is interchangeable with the VW originals.  We are the only company to
use the correct shape channel for our frames.  Our competitors use a
less expensive and inaccurate flat three sided channel for their
frames.  These not only look wrong but will not seal as well either.  On
the subject of seals, we have developed the best seal money can buy for
our frames as we recognize that this is the biggest problem for safari
owners.  While we can not totally guarantee against leaks, we can be
sure that our seals work better than any other including N.O.S. original
VW items.  Our kits include new frames, new toughened safety glass,
polished stainless steel sliders and latch  tabs, latches with the
correct stainless steel bases, stainless wing bolts, inner and outer
body brackets, inner and outer rubber seals, wiper dissengagers and a
one eyed duck.  We also include every nut, bolt and screw you'll need
and there are fitting instructions to help.&quot;
