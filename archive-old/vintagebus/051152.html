Subject: Re: [VB] Listee stickers?

Rich,
You are correct sir.....cut vinyl stickers.......likely a 
'vintagebus2type2_dot_com' and a simple bus graphic.

There seems to be some interest,  If it keeps up this way...I will post more 
details...work something out for our non-west listees., and post some artwork 
or a sample pic.

&gt; Agree with Ray on this one. I am thinking that it would look something
&gt;  like this, with the appropriate text of course:

&gt;  
&gt;  I do these for another site (guess which) and they are about $1.50/pair
&gt;  in quantity. Beto, is this what you're thinking about?
