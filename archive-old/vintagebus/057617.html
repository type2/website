Subject: [VB] #1 California VW show?

List,

I just moved to California and would like to invite my brother, who
surpasses me as a VW nut, to a VW show in California.  What are your
recommendations?  He'll only get to come once probably, and he's a fan of
all vintage and race VW's.  What show would be the best to fly him in for?

Thanks,

Charles
