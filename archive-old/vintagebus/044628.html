Subject: Dealer logo'd panels
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Does anyone have any good pictures of Panel vans with Dealer logos? I am 
thinking about painting up my 60 DD to look like a dealer delivery van and 
wanted to get an idea of how different dealers did theirs.
Were there any guidelines from VW?
Thanks,
Brian
