Hi Folks
I have heard alot of conversation on Todays Fuels lately... and as it really
adversly effects the Aircooled engine,, I thought I ask for some input,

I have been told by different aircooled mechanics, from garden tractor to
motorcycle to Vw..... that todays fuel is oxygen bearing fuel,   [Which is a
different problem than the no lead fuel]

Is there any fact to that?  Is there test markets of oxygen bearing fuel??

The belief is auto makers need lower emissions,, also , they like lower
costs.. Fuel mfg's know they can add oxygen ,, it dilutes the exhaust or
promotes more complete combustion,and reduces the ppm of polutants but it
increases heat in the cylinder head

The AUTO mfg's like the idea of oxygen bearing fuel as the liquid cooled
engines will tolerate it, they will not need an air pump [which added air
AFTER the valves, into the exhaust ]

The fuel mfg's like adding oxygen, as it gives them a way to get rid of a
product,, I can't think of the name of the oxygen component,,, and the
product they sell has less gas more air,  a filler if you will .... for the
same price!
Like adding rice krispee's to chocolate.... same size candy,, for less cost
as it cuts down the amount of costly chocolate...
I know a tanker driver who hauls this additive and is astonished at the
amount that is being added to the local reservoirs...

The environment folks love the reduced emissions.... and if there IS a side
effect of ruining the old aircooled engines,,, who cares,, as they would
love to crush older cars anyways,,,

Visious circle says, the AUTO makers sell more cars cause the old aircooleds
engine are toast........

Anyways,, It seems as if there is alot more T4 with dropped seats ,, and
T1's with #3 exhaust valve problems... and I hear the small aircooled guys
complaining that they are loosing aircooled impliment engines way tooo
fast??

Seems to me that an aircooled needs to be tuned to compensate for this,,
with reduced compression ratio's.. richer fuel / air mixtures,, and retarded
timing numbers....

I guess any of the above will compensate for the others,,, older,, slightly
worn engine,, lower compression ,, that is a little lean,, and has the
timing set accurate will run until it is worn out,, but if you build a NEW
engine,, it has renewed compression in comparision to the worn engine,, and
the builder wants everything perfect,, so the ignition timing is set right
on spec,,, and same with the fuel/air ratio... for good milage...
POOF..... a overheated valve,, cylinder head,,,
not a bearing,, as todays OILS have gotten alot Better!!  But that is
another thread  :-)

Can anyone who has experienced the NEW engine that dropped a valve or a seat
for no apparant reason chime in on this one???  pmail me please with your
thoughts and I will try to put together the facts and post them.

Anyone have facts ?
