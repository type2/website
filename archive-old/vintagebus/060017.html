Thom's right. You can't take a formula for paint to any paint store and have them mix it and expect
to get the same results. This is because PPG base colors are a certain shade, Glasurit colors are a
different shade, etc.

If you have unlimited funds, Glasurit is your best bet to make an exact match to original because
their formula was the one used when the car was painted for the very first time.

&gt; It's going to depend on what brand and product line you use.  Omni is cheap and easy
&gt; to use, but itsn't that great of a paint.  PPG CLV is a better paint, mid-range price-wise,
&gt; and is easy to use.  Glasurit or Sikkens are better paints, but harder to use and much
&gt; more expensive.  As far as color codes, your best bet is to actually take pieces down
&gt; to the paint shop and have them mix the color according to your sample.  There might be
&gt; a formula for MG/SG, but there's no guarantee that their rendition looks like what you
&gt; think MG/SG should be.  I have a friend who'd love to sell you a gallon of &quot;coral red&quot;
&gt; he had mixed &quot;to formula&quot; that looks like the results of an unsatisfactory dining experience
&gt; at Taco Bell.
