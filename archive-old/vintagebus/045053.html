&lt;&lt; all,
 
 My speedometer needle seems to be draging a bit and I thought I would
 'carefully' disassemble it and see if it was anything obvious...  But I
 can't figure out how to take the needle off.  Does it pull off or is it
 threaded?
 
 Or, should I just send it off to someone and let them fix/clean it up.  If
 so, who does good work.
 
 Thanks

have you tried undoing the speedo cable and squirting lube down the cable 
tube?  perhaps the drag if because of that
