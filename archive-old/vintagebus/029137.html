Subject: shipping seats

Hello,
I need to ship a seat cross country...a middle seat to be exact.  How
should I do this??  Do I have to build a crate for it or something of
the like?  It needs to be shipped so that it won't be touched, knicked,
scratched... or even seen for that matter.  Any suggestions??

I'll also have a PERFECT salt and pepper middle seat up for trade...to
go along with the rear salt and pepper seat I have... bottom needs
recovering...but the top is good.  Anyone need em?  I need a turkis
middle seat for the my 62..... needs to be original and look sharp.
Separated seams are OK...but torn, ripped, or chewed up upholstery is
not...

Isaiah
