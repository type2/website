Subject: Wiper Assembly

My wiper assembly arrived finally .. yippee .. I opened the box and before I
even got out the door I broke it !!! Maybe the damage isn't permanent .. and I
have the piece from my old motor that I am pretty sure I can move to this one
.. but it just ticks me off.
I broke off one of the prongs where the wire ends slip on .. dammit.
