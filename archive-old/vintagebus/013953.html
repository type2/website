&gt; Whos gonna vouch that my 55 never came with front or rear bumpers?

A picture from an owners' manual, brochure, advertisement, etc. should
do.  You can also get a letter from a vintage car club attesting to the
equipage of the vehicle.  Would the list qualify as a vintage car club?

Heck, brand new pickups come without rear bumpers.  I wonder if the cop
knows what he is talking about?  CHP officers _have_ been known to make
mistakes!
