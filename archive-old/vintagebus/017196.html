&gt; Hello I've been lurking for a while enjoying all the
&gt; postings and I have
&gt; finally decided to get around to fixing up my 66
&gt; deluxe hardtop. Some of the
&gt; things like tune ups and replacing seats and trim I
&gt; plan on doing myself but
&gt; I wanted a mechanic to redo the brakes. They are in
&gt; need of new flex hoses
&gt; and slave cylinders. I took it to one guy and he
&gt; told me it could cost up to
&gt; $700 to &quot;do the job right&quot; and that seemed on the
&gt; steep side to me. Just
&gt; wondering if someone knew of a good mechanic in S.E.
&gt; New Mexico and how much
&gt; something like this ought to cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Dan
