Subject: pre 58 M-codes

In my extensive library I find no mention of M-codes being used in the
50's. I checked parts amnuals from 54 and 58. They must have had
something similar of course.
In any case that list must have been very short.
Even early 60's M-code lists are very short.

To figure out if you have double cargo doors should not be very
difficult in any case.
Same for the color, as there were very few.
Limited slip differential would be more tricky, same for mountain ratio.
Those require some crawling.

PS Anybody know of a pre 58 or pre 60 M-code list?
