Subject: Carb question

Volks,

Not to worry, not one of those Brosol/Solex questions.

I have a progressive on my 1835.  The retaining clip fell off and we can't
find it.  So the danged gas pedal goes flat to the floor at the most
inopportune times.  My Flaps doesn't have them.  Do you carry these suckers?

If you do, I can order some more stuff to make it worth your while.

Thanks,

Curt
