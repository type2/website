Ellis understands all of the points that Clara, true
to form, delineated for us all. True to my tiringly
smart alecky form, I was just busting the butt of a
friend and taking the oppty to pimp my under
appreciated '54 stating that it definitely is in shape
to make the trip and reinfore it's value/condition to
a potential buyer. Just doing the sales thing... If I
still have the bus I just might be driving it (from
Phoenix) to Solvang and back. It was thought that the
intended teasing would have been picked up as obvious.
No, I didn't intend it at face value. Pmail to the
party involved underscored the intention. Have seen a
photo of this incoming beast and it is very cool! =)
It is agreed that I try to tow or trailer an unknown
quantity new purchase (vintage) vehicle until all of
the services which Clara mentioned have been
conducted. My '54 was flat bedded from Port Hueneme
when it arrived in our Country.

FWIW, I think the key words here is &quot;unknown
mechanical condition&quot;  I myself would prefer not to
drive such a beast, especially with the lack of ease
of parts for some bits, without checking mechanical
condition...

Everyone, at ease,
