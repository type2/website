&gt; That's right Jim. You may be able to push it faster, but it is not
&gt; good to rev the engine higher than that unless you have a
&gt; counterweighted crankshaft.

A lot of it has to do with the transmission ratios (and few transmissions
have their stock ratios as our buses age and parts get switched about) and
the longevity we want from our engines.  You can probably get by with
cruising at 70, but the engine won't last very long.  Drop the cruise to
55 and the engine will last a lot longer.
