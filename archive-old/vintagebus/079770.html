Subject: Vanbondo sells out... *Nothing* Aircooled Remains

As of Friday, to the best of my knowledge, I no longer have ANY aircooled
parts, nuts, bolts, vehicles or anything~! This is the first time since 1978
that my property is without ANYTHING aircooled. I am sure that certain folks
may be thrilled to hear of this change. If pressed you could say that very few
manuals and books may constitute &quot;aircooled&quot; parts. I even tossed my first
edition Muirs into a box of bits that a friend took on Friday. I always thought
that Muir must have been peaking on 'Shrooms when he organized that book. My
prefence has always been the Bentley's.

I finally decided that I was *so* far out of the scene that I should simply
dump the smouldering ashes. A few close friends mopped the remains and will
benefit in their addiction.

If I hit the Powerball and move to a more moderate climate, then I may jump
back it. As it stands now with current availability of inventory, prices and
reliability of the smattering aftermarket bits I think that I will genuflect,
courtsey and bid adios as an active participant.

Back to lurking and encouraging everyone from a pedestrian vantage point.
Would dearly love to attend the OCTO/whatever else weekend but personal
business precludes my being there. Am finalizing the sale of &quot;Mom's&quot; house.
