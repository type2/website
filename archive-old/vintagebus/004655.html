&gt; If you want heat.  You don't know how many people I've seen put full
&gt; headers on because they &quot;needed&quot; the extra power, only to rue their
&gt; decision when old man winter came knockin'.
&gt;
&gt; If you live in the tropics, then by all means go for it

Amen to that!
I moved from Germany to Texas. Drove my bus from PA to TX
Before I drove it down I put a new engine in it. When installing it I used
J-tubes.
Well the winters here have a worse bite than I thought! If the ambient temps
don't
drop much below 40 degrees you'll be OK without them. I heard using J-tubes
actually
makes yourengine run hotter(someone here?). Found no proof of this, I drove
my bus 1,800 miles
here in 95+ degree heat, and here in 110+ heat without any overheating
problems.
