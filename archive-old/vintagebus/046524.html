Hi all,

	I've recently taken a couple of &quot;road trips&quot; in my bus and I thought I
would share them with you all.   I've been away from home for a couple
of months so you'll have to forgive me if these seem trivial and no big
deal, but I've been going through, among other things, serious bus
withdrawal!!

	Last Thursday, I hopped in the ol' bus, topped off the tank, and drove
about 20 miles (that's right, 20 whole miles; at once even) and enjoyed
the warm weather around beautiful Bremerton, WA.  I had the windows slid
back, the vent open (&quot;don't need no stinkin' safari's&quot;), the warm summer
breeze was whipping through the cab...  What a wonder feeling!!!  

	Saturday I packed up the mountain bike in the bus and headed to Tahuya
State Forest (about 50 miles round trip!!!!!!!!) and rode some sweet
singletrack trails (but that's for another list ;-).  It wasn't as warm
and wonderful as Thursday, but hey, I was drivin' my bus so it was
KEWL!!!  

	I had so much fun, I didn't even notice the &quot;horse-hair cushion&quot; poking
me through tattered seat or the fact that I didn't have a radio to
listen to.  Just the beautiful music of a well tuned engine and the roar
of the road under the rubber was all I needed to soothe my &quot;bus-fix&quot;.
Keep on drivin' those wonderful busses... (and tellin' others about it
;-)
