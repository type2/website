Subject: Not Washer bottle buttons! but Rings Instead
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well my question is a little different.
I HAVE the washer bottle, AND the big button
is functional, but I have no large ring with
which to attach the rubber button to the bottle.
They were in the box of parts that came with the
bus.  It's not a press fit, there's a ring
with threads to fit over the button.

Anyone have an extra hanging around?
If I can't find one, I'll have to do what's
in my sig line, now you wouldn't want that
on your conscience woodya!

&gt; That is perhaps the most frequently asked question by people that 
&gt; find a
&gt; washer bottle in a junkyard.
