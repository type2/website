Subject: RE: [VB] porsche pulley in

  Almost every after market degree pully I have seen uses a 10 width belt
and after there are used up to an 11. Most of the aftermarket degree pulleys
have a different angle and width V groove in them. I have found that Gene
Bergs and SCATS are the best. EMPI, Bugpack and all the rags mag ad ones are
pure crap. Latest Rages heavy degree pully is awesome with the correct
groove and depth and also are balanced perfect

&gt; &gt; Anyway it was a dissapointing 1.6 DOH!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; Hmm, what diameter is the lower pulley you are using now??

Well I have a number of 1500 and 1600 engines about and all of the stock
pulleys and this degree pulley are the same diameter.&gt;
7 inches nominally..
the degree pulley is very slightly smaller at edge but is is constructed a
bit differently and I think it makes the belt ride right down in the
groove whereas the stock pulleys the belt doesnt seem to sit all the
way down.
