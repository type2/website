Hello bus gurus.  I have a question or two.  The first is just a curiosity.  Part number 211 721 631A  and  211 721 631B.  It seems the B is for early bus and A is for late.  Am I confused or is this one of those oddball VW contradictions?

The second question is on part number 211 425 119.  What are these?  I couldn't find them in my books.  They are a grommet or bushing of some sort.

I will probably have more questions as I try to figure out exactly what I bought at Bad Camberg.

Thanks,
Richard
