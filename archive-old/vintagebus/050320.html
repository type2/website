Subject: US distributor for Bay-Splits LTd. in U.K. ?

I was wondering if there was a US distributor for Bay-Splits Ltd. They're a
UK company that sells fiberglass bus panels. They've got one that is a
split-screen nose skin made to be installed on a Bay-window bus.
Interesting. Maybe it'd fit the front of one of those Brasilias with the
split-screen style body &amp; bay-window style nose.
