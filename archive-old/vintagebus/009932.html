&gt; Yup.  An knowing how notoriously cheep a lot of bus people are,
&gt; it makes it that much worse.
&gt;
&gt; I'd love to repop rear ribbed bumpers, but I don't think I could
&gt; sell enuf of them to make my money back, much less a profit.

their

no one
&gt; &gt; would be able to afford them. It doesn't make good business sense.
