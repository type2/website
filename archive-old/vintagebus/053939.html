&lt;&lt; My theory is that VW did not incorporate a regular paper oil filter 
because the engines would die from other causes before small crud particles 
would eat it away to fail.  Also with oil changes at every 3,000 the oil will 
remain very clean.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Adrian,
VW did offer in thier accessory catologs a partial (Non-Full Flow.) oil 
filter in the early 1960s for 40HP and later engines.
 
 &lt;&lt;Personally I like the Maxi Pump 3:

 Off of this you can run a normal oil filter adapter with SS hose...  And no 
it does not leak oil like other filter pumps.  The only downfall is that the 
gears are aluminum and will wear somewhat quickly compared to stock steal 
gears. &gt;&gt;

We have been using Vintage EMPI oil filter pump with great success.  Huge 
differance in rod bearings in only 10,000 miles!  Have also been using CB 
(Made by Shradek) oil filter/pump with no leaks, no hoses to worry with, and 
steel rather than aluminum or steal gears.  P-)  The only problem with the CB 
oil filter/pumps is one has to cut to angle slightly downwards and have 
rewelded the neck between the pump body and the filter to allow the filter to 
clear the heat riser tube coming out of the stocker muffler on the left side. 
  While the sump filter may run OK on warm only climate VWs and/or at near 
sea level we would be nervous trying it in the high mountains where you are 
going to just get less vaccum in very cold weather when the oil is way too 
thick.
  As always a really thick shake will be impossible to suck through a straw, 
but one can easily blow through the straw all the way down to the bottom of 
the thick shake.   Eric&amp;Barb
