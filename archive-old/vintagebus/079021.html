Subject: boat trailer/camper

Awile back I was all posed to buy a boat trailer camper combintion from
Fred at The bus Company, I figured it was the ultimate trailer for my
Deluxe. Anyway I dreamed about it but never bought it. Then one day he
sold it to another VW busser. Anyway this weekend I spoted something
very similar parked on the side of the road for sale. After doing a 180
in the street, I checked it out. It is a bit different than the one I
originally looked at but this one is still pretty cool. Anyway the guy
that builds them is located here in Tacoma so Itook his card and copied
down the web adress . If any one is interested here you go. 
Disclaimer: I am not afiliated with the company, nor do I own one, just
thought they were cool. http://www.towrowtrailers_dot_com/
