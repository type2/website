 NatureNeed some help.  I noticed gear oil leaking after we got home from
 EveryBus.  Pulled the engine, it's leaking from the boots on either side and
 the front shaft that leads up to the gear shift was wet with oil.  Need some
 advice what to do from here.
  &gt;&gt;

you need to replace those axle boots.get some new ones, and put them on as 
directed in the Idiot book / Bentley.   It is a bad idea to drive with the 
tranny low on oil, so you should either just change or top up the tranny 
oil..  are the old boots torn, or just seeping?  Torn boots are bad, but 
fairly easy and cheap to deal with.

the front ooze could either be between the nose cone and reat of trans, or 
coming out where the hockey stick goes out of the nose cone.  There is a 
front tranny nose cone seal, which often leaks.   You can theoretically pull 
the tranny, pull the nose cone, and replace that seal, but unless it is 
really bad, or missing it generally oozes, not drips, keeping a protective 
film of oil unde rthe bus.
