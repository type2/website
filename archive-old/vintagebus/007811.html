OK. The show is going to be on the learning channel on January 10th.
Apparently on the &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; program. This should be interesting....

&gt; I for one would be very interested in watching this show.  If you could
post
&gt; more details it would be greatly appreciated. I have an '89 vanagon that I
&gt; would love to put a V6 into.  I know this is not the Vanagon list.....I
&gt; couldn't stand it and unsubscribed some time ago from that list.  But
since
&gt; it's a 'virtual Friday&quot;..........
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
