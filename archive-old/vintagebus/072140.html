Hi Billy,
These are the best trouble free clutch pressure plates we have used, though 
they are a bit stiffer at the clutch pedal.

&gt; B.  311-141-025E AM Cover, Diaphragm Style With Release Collar, 200mm 64-70 
&gt;  $49.50 

These we have had problems with and a friend of ours went through these like 
candy, and finally went to the nine spring type because we recommended it to 
him.  Due to this change he had no further problem with running his SP 1776 
dual carbed engine in his bus.

&gt; C.  311-141-031B AM Disc Plate, 200mm Rigid 64-71  $33.40 

A must if you are going to do some drag racing.

&gt; D.  311-141-031D AM Disc Plate, 200mm Spring 64-71  $36.60

Not good for drag racing because the springs in this disc will collapse.  For 
daily driving the springs help to reduce shifting shock between the engine 
and tranny helping both to last longer.
