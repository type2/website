Subject: Ate MC rebuild kit question

hello listee

Last year i bought an ATE master cylinder repair kit for my MC bus 1960, and
it look a bit like the one for sale here:

http://tinyurl_dot_com/6prp

In the repair kit there are two shaft with part no # 33312-22279 and #
33312-22269.

My concern is they are different from my original shaft in my master
cylinder who's part number is  33312 .

Now since the repair kit is listed for 57-67 bus, i wonder if:

1- it doesnt fit my MC, even if its listed 57-67;
2- its an upgrade to my MC and i need to replace the shaft with the new one.


The new shaft 33312-22269 is a bit longer than my original one!


my repair kit is  no # 211 698 201 and the Ate  #03.0370-3222.2

thanks for any info on this

mike
