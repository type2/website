  I have 2 kombi rear seats that are taking up too much space
they are both green salt and pepper but have pretty bad upholstery
with the exception of one bottom whitch is in great shape!
I wold like $100 ea. for thep but trades are deffinatelly welcome
this would probably need to be a local thing as I'm sure it would be 
expensive to ship!

I am located in bremerton,wa
