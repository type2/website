Brrrrr

It is getting cold out and that can only mean one thing. It is almost time
for FrozenBus: North Carolina's coolest VW bus campout. It will take place
on January 15,16 and 17. The site selection commitee is narrowing down the
sites and will issue the final report on Christmas Day. So far about 20
folks have commited to attend. Many are coming from out of state: Ga, Tn, Va
and SC. Will we have a potluck cookout and bonfire on Saturday night. I will
be putting up the burgers and dogs and Lauren from Ga. will be providing
Veggie grill stuff for the non-meat eating bus lovers. Everyone is
welcome:Barndoors(yeah we at least one in the Southeast), Splittys,
Baywindows, Vanogons and Eurovans. Relax and enjoy.
