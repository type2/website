Hi Everyone,

    I thought I'd let you all know about the work I'm doing on my bus.  It's
been marking it's spot on the driveway for quite some time now and lately
It's been showing signs of blatter control problems ;-)  I'd been waiting
for a good time to install that new larger gas tank and this would be just
the excuse I needed.

    I pulled the rear apron and bumper off and pulled the engine.
Everything came out without a hitch.  Withing an hour and a half, I had the
engine and fuel tank laying on the floor (gotta love working on a
splitty!!!).  I then did a test fit of the new tank and was surprised at the
tight fit, though it did go in.  I noticed that it sits in there kind of
funny with the bottom center rear sitting on the slight hump of the lip.  It
also appears to stick out too far to attach the straps (once lengthened, of
course).  Anyone got any experience making it fit better??

    After reaching a stopping point with the tank, I stripped all the engine
tin off the engine.  That's when I found the leak.  The oil cooler was
loose!!!  I tightened that up, removed the rockers, plugged all the holes,
covered the carb and loaded the engine and tin into the F*rd van and took it
to the coin-carwash for a good cleaning.  Wow those washers clean good!! the
motor almost looks new again.  Well, almost.

    After getting it all back home, I removed the heads so I could replace
the pushrod tubes.  Both heads showed no signs of leakage around the tops of
the cylinders as evidenced by the shiny, clean ring on the head.  Neither
head showed evidence of cracks between the valves either, so with that, I
replaced the tube seals, and replaced/torqued the heads to Bentley specs.  I
replaced the rockers &amp; pushrods and retorqued those as well.

    That's where I left off for today.  I'd like to upgrade the cooler and
fan shroud to a doghouse unit at this time since I've got everything out,
but with the holiday$ coming, I'm going to have to hold off until a later
time for that.  Maybe after Y2K I'll do that upgraded.

    Tomorrow after work, I have to finish up the motor and hopefully make
some progress on the new tank installation.  If anyone got some info on how
to get the tank to fit better and sit flatter instead of cocked, I'm all
ears.
