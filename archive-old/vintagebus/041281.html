Well, I cleaned out my garage this morning, and found some old bits and
pieces I no longer need. These are now up for sale or trade. Everything is
best offer, or trade for parts I can use for my '64 deluxe. Everything is
shippable with the exception of the fold down seat/bed and the exhaust,
which would probably cost more to ship than they are worth. If you have
any questions, or are interested in buying or tradeing for any of the
pieces email me at aborgman_at_ichips.intel_dot_com

Parts for sale:

Bus wiring harness
Bus dome light
single port non doghouse tin pieces
4-1 exhaust
oil coolers and adapters
fold down seat/bed 
colling fan
.... plus more
