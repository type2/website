I carry 3 different German axle boots st this time and have had up to 6
different German brands at one time, I buy axle boots by the case or cases
as the last shippment I just got, Meistersatz seems to be the brand of the
month now, these are the heavyest of all the German boots and the rubber
does seem different then the other German boots i have, a lot heavier, and
no Volkswagen molded in them, Febi, Bilstein seem to be the lightest of the
3 brands, I have Meistersatz onmy panel, 3 years now and the Volkswagen
labed German ones on my D/D and they are starting to crack in a year, we'll
see how the Meistersatz stand up and i will report to the list.

ps, i do use the products I sell
pss. if you got those boots from me NQ, i will replace them at NC with the
Meistersatz.

NQ:

I have the same problem on my Baja Bug right now. The boots have the VW logo

on them and the package stated that they are from Germany. I installed them 
last summer and they are so cracked that they look as though they will split

open at any moment.

There must have been a run of bad boots shipped over from Germany last year.
