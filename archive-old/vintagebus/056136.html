Subject: Where is my VIN and other questions

Hello all,
 i know this has been covered before but where is my VIN? Its on a 62 or 63.
Is it the tag to the right of the motor below the gas tank?
 Also my bus seems to be a transition bus, or my info is wrong.
It has the pull door latches on the front door. it has the late style lip on
the wheel wells, it came with 15 inch wheels that look original with old
style tires. Thin lips on the dog legs.
Everything looks original , i dont think it has been tampered with.

Thanks
Bryan
