Ooookay, well, I go to start up my bus last night... It sounds normal, but
does not want to fire.  I was just riding around in it 5 hours prior, so
this one is a puzzle.  I noticed that the needle on my tach doesn't even
shimmer like it usually does. I checked the fuses. Fuses are good. I checked
to see if my new set of points were opening. Points are good. I replaced the
coil with a new one. Still no dice. I checked again to see if there were any
loose wires or any sort.  The battery is nice and strong and I have plenty
of gas. Any suggestions? My poor bus :-\ TIA
