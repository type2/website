&lt;I'm catching up with email so please forgive this post to an old thread&gt;

Credit should go to Eric and Barb.
 
The scan is of Eric and Barb's &quot;VW - CampingCar Instruction Manual&quot;.  Eric
and Barb were kind enough to send me a Xerox copy back in 1998 after we
traded emails on the type2_dot_com list.  I scanned the copy and emailed back
pages until their mailbox overflowed.  

The real document has color highlights that are used to point out features
of the camper.  It also has text in color blocks which were difficult to
read in the black and white copy and impossible to read in the scans.
That's why pages are missing. 
  
For trivia nuts,  this is not identical to the manual sold on eBay although
the content is essentially the same.  Eric and Barb have a very early
edition.  It is a &quot;CampingCar&quot; instead of a &quot;Camper&quot; etc. It also has a most
curious outright error - &quot;Volkswagen&quot; is misspelled!

Thurston Howell III &lt;cousinit_at_usa_dot_net&gt; sent me the SO34 manual scans, the
one that was recently on eBay. Credit goes to Steve Mighetto who sent the
scan's originally to Michael/Thurston. They are here:
