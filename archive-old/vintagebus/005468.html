Subject: RE: [VB] Wheel Straightening advice

You might try Stockton Wheel (also in CA)... search on Google_dot_com for their
number.

FWIW, I had some og empi two piece GT five spoke wheels welded and polished
by mag masters... they did a great job but didn't clean the back sides of
the wheels as I ask them (twice I asked actually both in writing and
verbally)... go figure.  You can see their work on my page:

If I recall, six wheels ran me right around $500.
