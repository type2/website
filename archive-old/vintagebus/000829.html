I just received my repo round tool kit and thought I'd pass along what I
thought of it.  It looks great and is put together very nicely.  The tools
are cheap, cheap, cheap, but it does say that the tools are for ornamental
use only.  I guess that's OK because I don't know anyone who uses the tools
in their round tool kit.  The blue color on the screwdriver handles seems a
little lighter in color than the real screwdrivers.  I guess I shouldn't be
too picky as the price was right and it will definitely look nice on
display.
