Hi Rich,
That is the only way to go!  Take off a front wheel and adjust the wheel 
bearing on that side.  Then bolt on each rim in question and measure how much 
out of round and side to side they are bent while spinning each one.  Check 
the VW bus shop manual for allowable specs.  Have any rims straightened or 
replaced if out of these specs!  Eric&amp;Barb
