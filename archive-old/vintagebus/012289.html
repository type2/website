Oh my Gosh! The Mighty VanBondo pulled a Freshman mistake.
&lt;red faced but over it&gt;

To find out who is selling the stuff send $10.00 to Vanbondo at... &lt;ah,
nevermind&gt;

Contact Big Scott Hall (Phoenix, AZ) at:
VWZWITTER_at_aol_dot_com

I will send him a list of who contacted him and in what order. In case there
is an arm wrestling match. 

TENT DETAILS:
The tent is a Westfalia Driveaway style tent as seen on Joe Clarks Tent page.
http://supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html/westythmb.jpg. The canvas is in
overall good shape with a little wear along the floor seam. This is the kind
of tent with the grey rubberized floor. It was introduced in 1967 for the 68
model year. Some 67 splitties were &lt;documented&gt; sold from the dealers with
this tent but was intended for the 68&gt; It works great on any bus with a rain
gutter 51 Barn through all years of Vanagons. I have no idea if the
Eurosleds have rain gutters... Shipping weight is 27-29 pounds when boxed up.

TENT POLE DETAILS:
See the section within Joe's tent page which is captioned as 
&quot;Got Pole Problems?&quot;
or go directly to:
http://supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/danhoug.html

Dan Houg made his own poles out of 3/4&quot; electrical conduit &lt;pipe&gt; and
available awning corner pieces. I did this exact thing and it works great.

RACK DETAILS:
First OEM Westy rack has been sold from a nonlist contact but he wants to
sell another one for $550.00.

*ITEM ADDED TO THE LIST FS*
Splittie Deluxe Engine Vent Trim 
Full set of OEM (not NOS) 18 pieces almost all with the clips.
$250.00 for set. *Firm* No separates please.
