Boy I used to get so burned up when I first started bidding on eBay when someone would snip me.  It royally sucked.  Then I realized that more often than not a lot of people were doing it, and didn't feel like they were doing anything wrong.  I finally decided, &quot;if I can't beat 'em, join 'em!&quot;

Bottom line is bid what you are willing to pay and live with it.  Whether you bid that amount day one or last second.  If you bid enough you win, if you don't you move on.  I agree with Kyle, if you throw out a large first bid then a lot of times people will chip away at it just to see what kind of money you're going to throw at it.  If you wait until late in the auction then there is less of a chance for people to &quot;test the waters&quot;.

I gotta tell you, I prefer a good ole swap meet.  Name your price, if I'm the first one to walk up to your pile of parts and will pay your price I get it.  This auction stuff can give you ulcers!

Robert
