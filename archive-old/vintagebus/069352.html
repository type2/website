Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What H4's is everyone using...

I've been running the 55/100 bulbs for about a year now, with no problems.

I don't have relays hooked up, and my switch does get 'warm' after extended
use. I have been thinking of running a large gauge wire from the battery up
to the front of the bus, and running some relays to get power directly off
of that to see if the lights could be noticably brighter. 40 year old wiring
has go to effect how bright those suckers can get. They are already plenty
bright already, but we're always looking for more, right? hehe.

Light pattern was great, until I put on a set of fluted lenses. Then it was
fanned out too much. So I broke the glass out of my H-4 housings, so that I
only had the fluted headlight lens there, and the light patter is as good as
it was before. Suprising for the el-cheapo fluted lenses I found at Sacto
last year. Now my headlights look just like those euro buckets that sell for
over $200 bucks! lol.

Anyway, not meant as spam, but if anyone buys some H-4's from us, and do not
like the light pattern, you can send them back for a refund, no questions
asked.

Along with everyone else here that has H-4's, I'll never go back to sealed
beam headlights again!
