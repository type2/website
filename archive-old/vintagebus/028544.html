Subject: More...hard to shift

I worked on the crew cabs  hard shifting problem tonight.  I replaced
the bowden tube and greased everything up.  Started it up and pushed in
the clutch.  A horrible racket ensued.  I shut it off and proceeded to
do what I'd been avoiding....pull the motor.

Once I looked into the bell housing I saw what was causing all the
racket.  The clutch release plate (I have a original '71 3 finger
clutch) had detached from the clutch and was sitting on the tranny input
shaft.  Its a bit scratched, but not totally thrashed.  It looks like I
can just slip the light springs from the cover back over the 3 ends of
the release plate and re use it.  Can I purchase this part separately if
it needs replacing?

What might have caused it to come off?  I checked the shaft and gland
nut and both were nice and free and properly greased.  The clutch was
properly centered also.

Lastly the TO (release) bearing now spins really easily.  As I remember,
this is a sign of needed replacement.  True?

Thank You.
