My thoughts here...

DONT DO THIS.  While I know that a few list members have done this to
dolly a bus, it really made me cringe.

The horns are not built to hold the weight of a bus.  Instead, onlyy to
support the engine and transmission.  The engine/trans load is DOWN on the
horns...the bus would be pressure UP on the horns..


You have a very good possibility of BENDING your horns.

This, IMHO, is a Bad Thing.


A Better place would be, perhaps, the springplates if they are attached.
Or sort sort of &quot;clamp-on&quot; system that would grasp the torsion tube.

&gt; except that a plate is bolted to the front beam frame locations (one
&gt; for each side)and it (the plate) is welded to a notched pipe or square


This, OTOH, is fine.
