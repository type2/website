Actually a search on &quot;aluminum tumbler&quot; will work better.  I don't think
the things being fronted as &quot;westy&quot; tumblers really are.

&gt; &gt;I was wondering if anyone knows the phone number of the guy who is
&gt; &gt;reproducing the early westy tumblers and shot glasses.  There is also
&gt; &gt;someone who had a bunch of originals for sale.  Any help is greatly
&gt; &gt;appreciated in locating either person.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do a search on Ebay for 'Westy' or 'Westfalia'.  You will find a guy who
&gt; sells the aluminum tumblers there regularly.  Don't know if he's your man
&gt; or not.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, what years are they correct for?
