Subject: [VB] RE: The Empi Truck

How arrogant can one be? 
He should not take it personally as I think most of us are smart enough to
realize the true value of this vehicle, granted it may be a &quot;collectors
piece&quot; but, there is no way on this green earth that this guy is going to
make mint off it. Not in that condition...we ought to flood his inbox with
&quot;1000's&quot; lowball offers of $500 and $600 dollars....

Makes me sick,
Scott

&gt;Don't take this personal but i don't want to answer 100's of emails that
arn't from SERIOUS 
&gt;collectors. This isn't a couple of hundread dollar truck. Thanks for
viewing this ad and
&gt;understanding. thanks.
