&lt;&lt; Could someone tell me if the blaupunkt on ebay right now will fit my 59
 without any cutting??? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Yes it will fit the hole, but it would be wrong in year and even has 1964ish, 
and later light gray color push buttons.  If you want something more your 
year or at least the proper color we can keep an eye out for you, and Pmail 
you something from Ebay that would be more for your year bus.  If so, what 
color are the rest of your knobs?  Kombis, deluxes, and westies had ivory 
knobs while the trucks, panels and other lower price models of bus had black 
knobs.  We just saw a nice four band (AM, FM, SW, LW) with black push buttons 
for sale that would have fit ypur bus!
