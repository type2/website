Subject: Re: Cylinder Fin casting &amp; Case Question


&gt;On one of the cylinders, there is a web running down the length of
&gt;the cylinder fins from the head end to the case end.  This web is on both
&gt;the top and bottom side fins and extends all the way to the edge of the
&gt;fins.  All the other cylinders have what look like remnants of the same
&gt;thing, but the #4 has full webbing.

That is called &quot;casting flash&quot;. The archives don't have much on this;
several Hoovers but he mentions it only in regard to heads, not barrels.
Brian Verbeek seems to have had a similar problem and abraded it off, which
is what I would do, especially if it were extensive.

That last should be all one line.

Whoever made those barrels was a hack and you should measure the bore and
check everything *else* that might be screwed up before you install.
