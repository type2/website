Subject: gas heaters

Damn! I'm stupid. Early morning.

This is what it is: (sorry)

Heater model
Stewart Warner 8443     20,000btu's         .3 gph           9-10 amps
Eberspacher BN4           15,900btu's       .175gph               4 amps

I don't know what track my brain was on.....hahaha

&gt; &gt; Check out page 69** of the Eberspaecher BN4/BA6 manuals Thom has up at

&gt; &gt; put out 15,900 BTU/hr max, while using 0.20 to 0.65 liters/hr (0.42 to
&gt; &gt; 1.4 US pints/hr) of fuel and 50 W (4 A) of electricity.
&gt;
&gt; just to add to this. I'm not sure if Eberspaecher gives it's fuel
&gt; usage the same way as the stewart-warner heaters, but...one of the SW
&gt; manuals I read gave a usage per hour. It also noted that this was
&gt; burning full time, and gave a number around actual burn time was 30%
&gt; IIRC. So the actual fuel usage should be less. EB might have rated
&gt; their heaters the same way.
&gt;
&gt; Since running my SW I have noticed a 1-2 mpg dip in milage. But who
&gt; cares, I'm warm!
&gt;

My Stewart Warner is rated to burn 0.3 Gallons of fuel an hour while
burning. With the adjustable thermostat, the burner does not burn all the
time (it cycles), so fuel useage is even less than that.

According to the math, if my burner was going non stop all the way from SLC
to Las Vegas (it takes me about 7 1/2 hours in my bus), I would burn around
2 1/4 gallons of fuel during the whole drive. I've listened to the burner
(on the hottest setting) cycle on and off on a 25 degree morning, and it
seemed to burn for about as long as it wasn't (50%). So if during the entire
drive to Vegas was sub freezing temps, I would still only use about 1 1/8
gallons for the drive. If it's in the 30's-40's during the daytime, it would
be a lot closer to the 30% cycle time as stated above. On the lowest
setting, i've listened to it on a 40-45 degree day, and it seemed to cycle
probably closer to 15-20% of the time.

I would say, fuel consumption when using the heater is anywhere between 2%
and 6% on my bus. Not too bad. Worst case, my mileage is going from 24mpg
down to 22 1/2mpg. I can still go almost 340 miles to a tank of gas (bay
tank), so i'm not complaining at all. 20,000 BTU's is keeping me toastier
than my stock heater ever did, and small loss of gas mileage is sooooo worth
it!  :-)

It sounds like the SW gas heaters are more efficient than the Ebers are? I
still have to give the nod to Ebers for looking much more suited in a VW
engine bay though. Interesting. They seem to compare like this(?):

Heater model
Stewart Warner 8443     20,000btu's         .3 gph           9-10 amps
Eberspacher BN4           15,900btu's       1.3 gph                4 amps

This seems like a huge difference. The figures for Ebers given say 1.4 US
pints an hour, which comes to 1.375 gallons per hour (I just called it 1.3
though). Are these numbers wrong, or are the two different heaters this much
different as far as efficiency? The gph figures would go down with heaters
cycling and all, but still quite different. From what it sounds like, I
lucked out getting a SW instead of an Eber after all.
