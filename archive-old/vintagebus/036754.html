&gt;Last
&gt;night she asked me to find out if the owner of a beautiful sky-blue &amp;
&gt;white hard-top camper that she's &quot;in love with&quot; (the bus, sillies) she
&gt;saw heading south on I-5 is on The List.

post if you find out the owner of this one. Ask he or she if they got it
anywhere near Jacumba CA in 1990. If so it was my first bus that I lost
in the desert.
