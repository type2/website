&gt;Cecil claims to have documentation that states that no buses
&gt;came with side mirrors - either side - and that they were all added
&gt;at the dealers.  I countered that that was absurd, and that the
&gt;sheer labor of adding mirrors to thousands and thousands of

My first thought was that Cecil is nuts!  I scanned through all my pictures
(mostly old VW ads) and found all of them showing buses with mirrors.

Except for one!  There's an ad from the early 60's that shows a guy in a
red/white bus looking out the window at a bug sitting next to him.  Neither
the bus nor the bug have any side mirrors.  Very strange!!  I'll check some
more at home tonight.

I'd definitely want to hear about Cecil's &quot;proof&quot;.  This may be an
interesting thread....
