Hi jim and list....

I am not sure about Thom's story...but I sent dues to SOTO in early `94.  The
check was cashed and nothing received...ever!   Mine is a tale of endless phone
calls...photocopies of a canceled check, and even a personal plea to Mr. Heard
himself at the  `94 Annivesary SOTO meet (the one which I meet you at jim).   This
was also  the meet in which I traveled nearly 6,000 miles round trip to in my `67
Westy to get to.  I was a complete gentlemen in this matter and was very friendly
in my pursuit.  Well after nearly a dozen phone calls with no reply, and nearly  a
half dozen letters with copies of my canceled check ALSO with no reply.....I
finally made a 6,000 mile personal visit to the SOTO Anniversary show in `94 and
spoke with Mr. Heard personaly. He knew who I was and was shocked at the distance
I had drve to this show.  Mr. Heard was very nice and said there must be a mix
up...he took my vitals and said he would fix it right away.  I STILL never
received a single newsletter or heard another word form SOTO or Mr. Heard again.
Needless to say I have never been to another SOTO meet or supported any of its
functions.  After a couple years of trying you just give up!!

I did contact Mr. Heard via email this past year (again) bringing this problem to
light (having heard he was &quot;fixing&quot; all of SOTO's problem's).  He was cordial and
said he would give me a full years membership if I could send he a copy of the
canceled check from `94!!  Well that check is long gone!!! and I am still out $20
and a lesson learned.

I feel I have $20 worth of personal slams at Mr. Heard at my disposal.  No
appologies here.  Sorry Jim.

&gt; in the differences
&gt; between yourselves and any club or any of its individual members. Even in my
&gt; most smart***ed moments I try to stay far away from personal slams. If
&gt; anything else I use self-depricating humor because I know who I am and what
&gt; I'm really like.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion is to contact Dave directly and work out the issues offline.
&gt; You never know who is lurking on the lists. Be cool.
