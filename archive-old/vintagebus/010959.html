Hi Volks,

&quot;bill cobabe&quot; &lt;bcobabe_at_ubtanet_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; Question 1.  Any other suggestions on cleaning the tank before I put it
&gt; back and go for a ride?

Fill it with a few shovelfuls of really sharp gravel, tie it to a concrete 
mixer and let it rotate for a few hours.  If you have no access to a concrete 
mixer, shake it for a few weeks.  ;-)

Seal it with your favourite brand of fuel-proof paint, by putting some inside 
and sloshing it around.  Allow to dry.  Repeat while necessary.

Hope this helps.

Yours,
    Erik.
