If someone uses the archives one can find my original post on using a later 
model fan with a 1600. (Also if one looks one can also find my rant on why 
archives are great but we will all come to a point of realization that 
sooner or later nothing new can be posted and all is in the archives so we 
might as well stop the list!!!) AHEM.

Anyway,

I took a later model squirell cage bus fan and mounted it under the rear 
seat. Intake became the air inside the bus. The output was then directed 
into ONE heat exchanger. Now I had recirculating air, hopefully heating more 
and more as time went on.
At the fan shroud I coupled (using a Y) both of the hoses off the fan shroud 
into the other heat exchanger. Now I had fresh and powerful heat out of the 
other outlet, the one to the front.
Worked so so. My bus is drafty, but I did see some improvement.

HOWEVER: Come spring I removed the setup and went back to the stock 
arrangement.

You may not be able to easily perform this, I was lucky (or maybe cursed) by 
the fact that I had a place to put the hose: where a gas heater tube had 
already been cut out.
