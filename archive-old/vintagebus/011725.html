&lt;My list:
1
* clutch disk
* pressure plate
* Rear main seal
* flywheel o-ring
* tranny mounts
* new axle boots
* clutch cable
* muffler bearings
* throttle cable
* oil cooler seals
* engine compartment seal
* throwout bearing
* check fan tightness
* fan belt
* take some emery cloth and clean up the face of the flywheel
* check end play and flywheel runout

All of these things will go a long way to making your road trips
worry-free&gt;

If you, unlike Thom and seemingly the rest of the list oligarchy, are a
normal poor person with the money in your pocket as your budget, take a
good look at everything and don't fix what isn't broken, then reinstall. 
Except for the muffler bearings, those are a must...

For those that were hoping to beat me up in Jerome; I'm afraid I won't be
there this year.  But keep Solvang open for a good fight....
