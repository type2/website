Subject: [VB] Westy / ignition lock?

Well, the new-to-me Westy is finally home.  I am extremely pleased :-)  I pick up the Kombi next weekend to embark on a week long road trip.  I will be spending time in Cleveland, OH; Berea, KY; and Tallahassee, FL.  Any listees want to meet up?

On picking up the Westy, I spent some time waiting around for the tow driver to show up.  The PO has two buses for sale, and I wandered over to look at the '70 DD panel.  Turns out sitting on the floor inside are a straight rear bumper, complete with overriders and splash pans, and a what-not cabinet!  I called him and asked if he was interested in selling them, he said &quot;take 'em&quot; :-)  I took a picture of the shelf, this is what will be used to make measurements and compare for the repros, if we do them.  Is it actually the right shelf?  Has a hinged compartment on top.

Next, the enigma of the steering lock.  This does not look like the ones I have seen...it is stamped &quot;made in Germany&quot; on the electrical portion.  The tumbler is mounted on the side rather than the rear (FIF) of the switch, with no lettering on the bezel.  I dug in the archives, and found a post saying that I may have a 1967 only switch, and the tumbler is directly replacable out of an early bay bus.  Really?  How is this done, 'cuz I have no key for the one that is mounted?  If it's in the Bentley, ignore this...the Bentley is with the Kombi in Cleveland.  Along with most of my tools.  Pics of the switch...

Thanks for any help.  Unfortunately it was growing dark when the bus was here, and it will be raining all day tommorrow...maybe next Friday before I head up to Cleveland I'll have a chance to explore further.

PS -- parting question: I have four colored reflectors marked &quot;Hella&quot; on this thing, on the front and rear fender wells.  Are they original?
