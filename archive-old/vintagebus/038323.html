Subject: Petrol blockades

The truckers and farmers have started to blockade the refineries in the UK
and parts of Europe causing serious shortages at the petrol stations.

Standard unleaded and diesel have just gone up to approx US$5.50/gallon and
rising and the city where I live in the north west has only got diesel left
after days of panic buying.

It's going to be a bit of a damp squib if it doesn't get better by the
weekend as it's Vanfest in the UK and VWEuro in Holland, although the Dutch
are being a bit more mild-mannered about it so visitors to Euro should be
OK. I was planning to go to Vanfest but not now because I have no gas. In
fact I was forced to bike to work :-( 

What exactly happenend when you protested about rising fuel prices over in
the US? Is there much of a difference in price between states? Just
interested in how it panned out.
