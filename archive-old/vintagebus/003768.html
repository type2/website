remember.

And one other thing that I couldn't find today at the OCTO meet: the cargo
door outside handle. It is one-year-only L code. [xxLxxx]
66 and older is Txxx.
I didn't get any keys for my 67. The front doors and rear hatch all have the
same L code but someone replaced the cargo door handle with a T code handle.
My plan was to get a L code cargo handle and have the other the door handles
coded to it. Wrong!

Does anyone have a L code cargo door handle laying around? It doesn't need a
key but must be in one piece:)  Prefer good chrome....
