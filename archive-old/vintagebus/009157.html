&gt; Sorry you feel that way. The truck is sitting in my back yard as we speak.
It made it home after about a month of flatbed BS. It hasn't made it into
the shop yet though due to lack of $$$.
&gt;
I'm glad to hear that you got it home safely.  I hope you realize the part
about it all being an elaborate lie was partly in jest (thus the smiley
face) and partly to evoke a response, which it did.  People on and off the
list were wondering what became of it and if it was really true.  If you say
it's in your backyard, I believe you... but pictures prove it.

It is shame you do not want to show it off.  As a parallel example, a listee
on the Type 3 list recently found Notchback #10, which I am sure, without a
doubt, is the rarest Type 3 on the planet.  Pictures were up the night he
purchased it so everyone could enjoy it.
