Subject: quality roof racks

i know that he has been mentioned before, but Tom Conners near Spokane 
Washington(Dear Park) makes really nice racks-metal and wood. i bought one 
this summer and was very impressed. They are strong and look really good. He 
makes ladders as well and is so nice to work with. i was in a time crunch 
and ordered one with two weeks notice and i went through his town and picked 
up - the rack was awesome-and he had painted it for me!!! he wasn't going to 
have time because of my short notice, but he did because he knew i was on my 
way across the country and didn't have time to to do it myself. great 
guy-great product at a good price. i paid $365 for a six foot long wood slat 
rack. you can find them cheaper, but you never know what you're going to 
get. if you want more info i think i still have his number.
