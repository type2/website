&gt; *Fortunately* my busses/car are not up to par with Kelly Park and I will be
&gt; walking in to the place, I think...   Never been to KP, can I park outside
&gt; somewheres and walk in with my little red wagon?  Or do you have to wait in
&gt; those everlasting lines you all are venting about to get to the parking
&gt; area?  Thanks for any suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; No matter what condition you bus is in, I think it's worth the $20 it cost
last year to park my DC inside KP, and not have anything stolen off of it on
the street outside.  One person's beater is another's treasure chest!
