&gt;We are 
&gt;still sending out newsletters (I hope to finish the March/April 1998 
&gt;issue this week), but as you can see, they are running very late.

I am here to help.  I am a designer by trade and can do you newsletter if 
you need the help.  I also do web site design.  If you need help, ask.  I 
would be happy to see what you need and how my services can apply.
