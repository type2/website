&gt; in their right to
&gt; personal privacy.  Across the street from the VW Bus
&gt; Camp at Burning Man
&gt; two weeks ago 3 people running the Spaghetti Western
&gt; Camp got busted for
&gt; smoking something in their own camp site.  This is
&gt; after feeding maybe
&gt; 300 people nice spaghetti dinners absolutely free. 
&gt; A wind down smoke.
&gt; Not a nice reward.  Good people should not have to
&gt; worry about the red
&gt; coats busting down their doors.    Gary Gibson
