Subject: Re:  [VB] floor jack
To: dfmartin_at_mindspring_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I've got one of those big floor jacks that I use on my '67 westy, my
son's '67 15 window, and my daughter's '72 super... It seems to be
giving out... It doesn't go all the way up, and I'm sure it needs fluid
and bleeding...

Anyone out there in VintageBus Listland ever fix one of these? Can you
use brake fluid? How do you bleed it?

Hi Dave, there is this stuff called hydraulic jack oil which you can get at 
your FLAPS. (BD folks- you put jack oil in your lever shocks).  you could get 
some and put it in your jack, but I had a jack that would leak oil it was old 
it sucked.  I got another jack.  I guess I could have replaced the seals in 
the jack, but I didn't.  I still have it I think, anyone want a free jack 
that leaks?
