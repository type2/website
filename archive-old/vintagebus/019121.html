Hi everybody.

I'd like to get some of DARTHVW's small parts
re-chromed (door handle, clock trim, OG nose emblem) I
was wondering if any of you know a source in or near
Los Angeles (or if there's a really good one elsewhere
I can ship the stuff I guess).

Also: What questions should I ask when I call, What
should I be looking for? Do they prep the stuff for
me?

Advise please

Thanks,
Jason
