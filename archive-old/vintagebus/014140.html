 Ive tried everything i know to figure this on out...
needless to say it was unsuccessful, so Ill throw it
out to yall...
 Heres the senerio... the blinkers &amp; E flashers work
fine with the key off, so does the indicator light.
But when I turn the key on, or when its running, the
blinkers &amp; E flashers still work, but no indicator! I
spent hours going over the schematics, spent the same
amout of time tracing wires... The tail lights have
been grounded correctly via the extra G wire that I
installed, also used the extra tang on the front
signals for an extra ground... The auto cancel on the
switch works, I just want to see the pretty arrows on
the dash blinkin at me:)
TIA,
