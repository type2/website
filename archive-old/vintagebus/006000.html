Well, there's a number of us a couple hours south of the TriCities in
Eastern Oregon...

Speaking of not taking jobs for VW's, I turned down a real nice job in
Madison WI due to the HUGE amount of salt they use in the winter... the guy
couldn't believe me when I told him that was one of the main reason!

i'm considering a job offer in the tri-cities area of washington state.  i'd
like to know if i'll have bus folks to hook up with in the area.  yup,
that's right... if there are no bus folks, the job can take their incredibly
generous offer and give it to someone who drives a h*nda or something.
