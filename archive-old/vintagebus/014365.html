Subject: [VB] Looking for Rear Valance for 61 bus!
Message-ID: &lt;19991221180421.97829.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hello Volks,

I recently purchased a 61 Kombi and am planning on restoring it this summer. 
  So I an now looking for a few parts that the vehicle is currently 
missing!!!  I am currently looking for the piece that the engine lid bottom 
locks into (bolts into the outsider corner rear fenders) (I believe it is 
called the rear valance).  Also I am looking for the handle assembly for the 
engine lid.  If anyone has or could point me in the right direction it would 
be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike
