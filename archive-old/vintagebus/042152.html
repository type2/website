I do know that in cold temperatures, the flaps do not open completely, and
vary their position to regulate the outlet temperature.  I figured this
out by gluing a pointer to one of the flap shafts and observing its
position after various types of runs.  Above 60F or so they seem to be
open all the time after initial warmup.

&gt; from what I understand you could get away without the whole thermostat
&gt; situation if you live in a warm climate, but in colder climates you need the
&gt; thermostat to hold the flaps closed(warming the engine/oil up much quicker)
&gt; until the engine reaches a certain temperature, then the flaps open to cool
&gt; the engine....
