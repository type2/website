Subject: RE: [VB] Wolfsburg West Truck Corners

hmmmm,

OK for straightening but once you start rust-repair welding or putting
heat into complexish shapes that aren't 'restrained' you do
end up with some interesting effects possibly more suited to an
art exhibition rather than going back on the bus?

&gt;   Hey Rex, just cut yours off and metal finish them back to shape.

Do you mean cut the corners off the truck, bang, patch, &amp; weld 'em 
back to shape, then re-attach them to the truck? Actually sounds like 
a good idea!!!!
