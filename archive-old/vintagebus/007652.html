I believe that it's not a split windshield because of the wipers. You might
not be able to attach anything to it except for a sticker. It's OK anyway.
It is a Volkswagen so just this is enough for me.

&gt; Hey yeah, I kind of like it too.  Just as with the new beetle I wouldn't
&gt; want to own one but seeing one of these going down the road would be cool.
&gt; I can see an aftermarket add-on in the making.  A strip that fastens down
&gt; the middle of the windshield to simulate the split window design.  It's
&gt; gonna be hard figuring how to make safari windows out of that big slab of
&gt; glass though. :-)
