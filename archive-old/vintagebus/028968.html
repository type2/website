I know Kabayo just posted his tire chart but I managed to toss it out. I did not
find it in the archives. Could you repost it, or better yet send it to my p-mail.
I bought some Marshal 165 15 tires about 5 years ago and they have started to
crack badly. I took them back to Les Schwab and they said they would warranty
them. It seems everyone agrees that the 205-75-15 is the right size, why is it
that these are a LOT taller than the 165 15? They do not look like a close
replacement at all. I am looking at a Les Schwab Wildcat. The manager said they
can order almost anything if I find out just what I want. I asked about the
Jupiter and he was not aware of one with the reinforced sidewall. I would like to
pick something up this week if I can figure out what. I just really don't want to
make the same mistake I made last time. Those tires were terrible.
thanks in advance,
