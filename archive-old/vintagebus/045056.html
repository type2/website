&lt;&lt; As you may remember, I have a 1600dp with stock trans w/RGB's in my 67
 21DLX. What is your thoughts? Can I get the extra gearing with only a 1600,
 and still pull the Hills, or should I consider taller tires?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Hart,
We are running a 1641 CW SP and are quite happy with the results.  We think 
for 90% of the volks that drive thier pre-1968 buses with RGBs that they will 
also be happy with the 3.875 R&amp;P tranny with 1600 or larger engine.  Of 
course there will be always those who will never be happy with nothing less 
than a 2 liter or even possibly a V-8!  We are happy with driving early bugs 
with 40HP engines, where others would not be happy with less than a 1600DP.
  Right now we are running a big bore 40HP engine with a 3.875 R&amp;P freeway 
flier.  Is it under powered uphill?  Yes, but either way over an 80 mile 
course between N. Seattle and Olympia we are taking less time, keeping up 
with traffic on the flats and downhills without having the engine screaming 
away.  With a 1500cc engine in it we would probably be satisfied with it 
since our SC is more for short trips.  Right now we are going through our 
parts and getting ready to assemble another CW 1641 SP which we will use for 
now in the SC for a while.  Before installing another freeway flier in our 62 
flip-seat which need body work then moving the CW 1641 SP to the Westie, and 
installing a CW 1600 SP in the SC.
  It is important to assemble an engine properly and not just throw a bunch 
of parts together.  With all our engines we have balanced the rods and 
pistons to within a gnat's arse, and now that we have tried out our first CW 
crank we will only be going with CW engines in all our VWs unless it is just 
not possible.  Anyone know where we can have 25-26 HP cranks CW welded?  With 
less vibration you get less noise, with less noise you get less driving 
fatigue over distances of an hour or more.  With less vibration/noise 
produced you definitely get more HP to the wheels due to less energy going to 
create vibration/noise!  We even do other things like blue printing the 
engine parts, measuring head ccs, adjusting them till they equal each other 
and raduising any sharp edges in the head chamber to prevent hot spots and 
flow eddies.  Polish out the exhaust passages in the heads to allow less 
surface area for the heat to soak into the head material and much more to the 
engine.  We will even polish the upper transmission axle so when it is 
turning it has less drag in the tranny oil inside the swing axle tubes.  Yes, 
it takes time, but if done before you need an engine/tranny it is relaxing 
and once together you will really be thrilled knowing you did as much as you 
could, to do it right.
  Before WWI the manufacture of the Lincoln automobile insisted on precision 
machining.  One of his competors who built the same exact engine for thier 
automobile did not.  This resulted in the Lincoln built engines producing 27% 
more HP!  
  As long as you build a good engine and drive your VW in the gears for the 
proper engine RPMs (1,500 - 3,000 RPM) not just MPH and it should work well 
for you.  The biggest problem with the freeway flier and even the Gene Berg 
five speed tranny is that some volks shift way too soon and lug or at the 
least RPM the engine too slow for the engine to produce the most torque which 
the type1-3 engines produce about 2500-2800 RPM which is especially important 
on hills!  Yes, you will probably not be able to do the really long steep 
hills you you used to barely do in fourth, but your third gear is moved up 
also so it will be at a higher MPH though not as high as the old fourth gear 
and climb hills better than your old fourth gear.  With the higher geared R&amp;P 
it is like taking a ladder with only four steps and each stock step being a 
10&quot; increase in hieght.  So the third step would be 30&quot; and the fourth step 
40&quot;.  Now increase the steps to 12&quot; each and third step is at 36&quot; and fourth 
step is at 48&quot;.  That higher shelf you just barely could reach before is now 
an easier one though the lowest self you could reach from the fourth step is 
now handier while you are on the third step.  So one just has to learn to 
adjust thier old driving habits for the new gearing which will result in long 
trips on todays busy crowded highways taking less time and more importantly 
safer though one of the slower automobiles, but no longer the slowest and the 
road block you were before.  Plus you will be able to keep your engine in the 
RPMs which as we have found keeps the oil temps down especially during the 
summer, double the engine longevity and the MPG savings at $1.60 per gallon 
today over an 80,000 mile period will cover most of the cost of an all new 
engine from the VW factories South of USA.   24 MPG instead of 20 = $1,066.00 
savings!     Eric&amp;Barb
