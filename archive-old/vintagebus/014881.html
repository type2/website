Found it and it was too late to bid but I had no intention to bid anyway.
Just wanted to see the picture again. Someone said that it is beyond
repair and by just looking at it I can say that it looks much better then
Thom's '54 RHD Euro which he started to work on a while ago. By the way
Thom, did you ever finish that project? I have seen a couple of different
projects on your web site but nothing more in regards to that '54 RHD
Euro. It looks better then the one I have seen somewhere in the field in
southern Illinois. Anyway, going back to that Binz, it didn't get even
close to the reserve price. I wonder why??///
