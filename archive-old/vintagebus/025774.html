&gt; Ok, I must be bored cuz I'm really curious about this song.  Actually I just
&gt; need some new material to sing to my three year old.  Thanks!

( Push your bus)

(Best if sung with a Wisconsin accent, dontcha know)

Push push push your bus
gently up the hill, 
downshift downnshift into 3rd
 or blow your motor will

cruise cruise cruise your bus
slowly cross the plains
keep yer beauty to the right
stay out the passing lanes.

coast coast coast your bus
swiftly down the hill
hit the throttle, speed er up
or be a semi's grill

park park park your bus 
safely back at home,
and remember always lock er up,
or without you she may roam...
