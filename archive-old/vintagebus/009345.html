I expect many people with operating flaps and an engine that seems to take
forever to warm up and run properly blame the flaps and thermostat, when
their real problem is a blocked heat riser and/or an improperly adjusted
carburetor and choke.

The flaps may be assisting the engine in warming up quickly just as they
were designed to do.  But it takes a long time for the heat from the heads
and crankcase to migrate all the way to the carburetor mounting flange and
into the carb body.  A working heat riser assures that the carb and the main
mass of the engine warm up at the same time, just as they were designed to
do.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I do know that in cold temperatures, the flaps do not open completely,
and vary their position to regulate the outlet temperature.  I figured this
out by gluing a pointer to one of the flap shafts and observing its position
after various types of runs.  Above 60F or so they seem to be open all the
time after initial warmup.  &lt;&lt;
