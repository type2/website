Hi everyone,
 
Well, I made it from FL to NC and then back to FL with my panel van. It 
was 915 miles round trip with only a minor problem with a left front 
tire of my truck. 
 
I'm just wondering if anyone can decifer the tag that is behind the 
passenger seat. It reads:
 
21 D
425 002 043
UN 2112 383883 6078245
 
Below the tag is a sticker that reads:
 
SAMTGRUN  L  512
 
There are two little dots over the U, but I dont know how to make them 
on the computer.
 
The van also has a cab divider that looks to be in very good shape. It  
does have a pading over it, so I am wondering if that is the way its 
supposed to be or did someone do this. The glass window is there too.
 
Thanks,
David
