second thoughts about it. And then I was chastised for it by Clara. And,
as usual, she was correct. And though I won't apologize for the
substance of my remarks, because I think my complaints and feelings to
be valid, nonetheless I would like to apologize for the way I made the
criticisms. I could have excercised a lot more restraint in the way I
made those remarks. To any I may have offended, please accept my
apology.

In my defense, these are trying times. I didn't expect to be so
affected. I thought I was too. . .. hell, I don't even know the right
word here. But suffice it to say that the last few days have been real
strange. Got lunch at a shopping mall and it seemed as if everyone was
in slow motion. It was a feeling I was sort of used to, being a product
of the sixties. But there were no substances involved and, this time,
everyone truely was in slow motion. I think the whole crowd was
experiencing a sort of altered state of consciousness bordering on
shock. Hell, I suppose it was shock. I supppose it is not just our
nation feeling it, but the entire world, too. At least the civilized
part of it.

And if I havem't made this statement here before, let me do it now: I
believe it the duty of all Americans and especially men, to get into tip
top shape. Because they have brought their JIHAD to us. And our families
are their targets. And we will never know just when they will strike.
But when they do, we should be prepared to return their serve: to give
them their JIHAD. I swear to you. . . when I fly (perhaps in two weeks),
if any of these RAT BASTARDS tries some shit, they will have to kill me
first. And I seriously mean it. I swear to you. . . I would just love to
throw one of those RAT BASTARDS off the plane: to give him a premature
introduction to Allah.

And I hope you will forgive my off topic ramblings. I needed to let
loose. Worked on the bus yesterday, and even that lacked satisfaction.

I will try to stay on topic from here on out.
