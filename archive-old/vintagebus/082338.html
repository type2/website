&gt; Torque is what the bus needs to get off the starting line especially with a

&gt; EX&quot; engine in the archives, and we would suggest looking for NQ's  building a
&gt; high flow &amp; HP engine and how just a few months later he was  trading off the
&gt; big $$$$ HP parts for stock parts to get his bus  running better.

Hi Eric &amp; Barb,

I've been thinking alot about these subjects since our email round
discussing them. I've also finished reading Fisher on getting more
power out of VW engines. With your thoughts in mind as I read it, I
can see where you don't want high revving engines and the big carbs
you were telling me about. But from my reading in Fisher's chapter on
heads, I thought high flowing heads would be a good way to get more
power usable for a bus. Then I see here you recommend against high
flowing engines and recommend single port.

So do you think bolting on high flow heads is bad for a bus? 

This issue also impacts on a Mexican dual port crate engine I was able
to pick up in Seattle for $300. I thought it would be good for the 65
Westy we are starting on next summer. What do you think?


&gt; Boring the  engine case
&gt; cylinder bores bigger for bigger cylinders weakens the  case and in the stock
&gt; aluminum/magnesium often causes a crack forward of #3  cylinder 

Oh boy. My case is bored for 90.5 for 1776. Plus lifter channels
clearance for 100 cam.

&gt; 69mm counterwieght cast crank (cast can be broken if over revved as a  norm).

I'm sure you meant forged crank here.

&gt; Someday we would like to try a forged stroker 72 or 74mm Cw crank with  1600
&gt; P&amp;Cs to see how it improves the torque and HP, or perhaps modify a 1800  type
&gt; 4 engine which are known to last 200,000 to 300,000 if maintained properly
&gt; and not overheated.

I'm also interested in your results with stroker crank. IIRC the 72 is
less work to fit the case.

My collection includes splits and bays with upright and Type IV
motors. I was thinking about getting rid of the Type IV's until Type 2
list readings taught me about the longevity of these motors and how to
deal with the dropped valve problem (as you said, avoid overheating,
and when rebuilding, use the improved heads).

Thanks

John
