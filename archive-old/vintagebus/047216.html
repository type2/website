Hi Wayne,
Definitely bolt it in with as big of diameter bolts as possible and washers 
that have a huge outer diameter (Often called fender washers.) to prevent 
having the seat and all it's contents launch forward if you get into an 
accident.  While you do all this you should contemplate installing seat 
belt/s back there in case you have to carry passengers back there!
