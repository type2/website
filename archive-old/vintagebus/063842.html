Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

Mmmm... I forgot the guy's name at Bus Boys, but he said that he had the
relief plug sender, and uses it himself.  The only problem is that it
records a lower temp than the drain plug sender (10 degrees?), which is
the most accurate location (according to him).  He didn't say anything
about hitting the strainer, but now you have me worried.  He did say
that he had added a one-quart additional sump when he used the drain
plug sender.  While that is probably a worthy add-on, I wasn't planning
on it now.  

Both senders are about $15.

I guess I'll call them.  Their online catalog doesn't show the oil
presure 
relief version, but does show the drain plug version.  Oddly, they say
to 
drill the sump for the drain plug version, as it is too tall and will
hit the 
strainer!   I guess they changed the shape, the sender in my 65' engine
does 
not hit the strainer.

ya, I do have a filter on that engine, but don't see any reason to
remove the 
strainer.   Maybe with the new sender it is a problem, dunno.

I have the relief plug sender in the motor in my 61, and I like it
better 
because the wires are more out of the way, I don't have to mess with the

sender when changing the oil, and I don't have to be careful with the
sender 
when pulling the motor.  If you forget to either pull the sender or use
a 
piece of wood with hole drilled in, you smush the sender with the jack.
oops.

&lt;&lt; Bus Boys has it.  I just bought the drain plug version, and he
mentioned
 that he also had the oil pressure relief plug version.
