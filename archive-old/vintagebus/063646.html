Steve,
         How's the painting over bare metal going?

Sounds like this is not any easier, just less use of the arm muscles. And,&gt; 
&gt; of course, not every one has a power ram
&gt; 
&gt;     If you'll reread the post, you'll notice that you can substitute a 
&gt; bottle jack for the power ram.  Just be sure to place some scrape wood 
&gt; under it to spread the load. Also by drilling the a hole in the end of the 
&gt; 4X4 the same size at the end of the bottle jack, things will tend to stay 
&gt; put better.  Why work harder than you have too?

   How do you get to the areas over the wheel wells and over the beams 
running
lengthwise under the bed with your power ram?

       For those without stud guns, you can use a piece of flat metal stock 
(I used to use  the one I screwed to my 4X4) and the thick end of a body 
spoon to gently pry up, go slow and check the top side with a straight edge.  
As for above the wheel houses you can still use that flat metal stock and a 
body hammer, although you'll need a friend to hold a dollie on the other 
side.  
                                                                 Peace,
                                                                       Frank
