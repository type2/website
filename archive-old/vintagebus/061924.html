the top bushing needs to stick out a bit (dimension 
specified in bentley). since i am assuming that the beam is still in the bus, 
then you will need to compress it somehow to get the slot to line up. i have 
used a big &quot;C&quot; clamp before, with no problems or long term or short term damage. 
don't hammer the wavy washer! if the slot DID line up without any pressure 
applied to the arm, then you may have shortened bushing life and a noisy 
centerpin. what would be the point of having a wavy (a.k.a. THRUST washer) if it 
were flat to begin with. read the bentley procedure...you must exert some kind 
of pressure to get the slot to line up.

Thanks for the reply.  I'm not sure if I should include the whole 
list on

this or not.  Anyway... people may want to know.

 

  both of the bushings pressed in far enough  

 

I have made sure that both bushings are to the specification of the 
Bentley

manual.  I have also been told that I can hammer the wavey washer 
so it's

not so wavey.  That may help but I'm not sure if that's a good 
idea or not?

I've got about an 1/8th of an inch before the bolt will line up with 
the

notch.  Too much?
