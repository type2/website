Subject: [VB] Relays

I'm sorry if it seems like I have a tone of questions but the PO left me
quite a bit to undo, redo, and start all over.  My DC ahs been converted to
12V, do the relays need to be replaced?  I have a 12V relay that I believe
is the flasher relay, but its obviously not the one on the wiring diagram.
Its shaped like a box and has four prongs.  One is connected with a pigtail
to the right front turn signal, but the other three aren connected.  Any
ideas what to connect to where?
