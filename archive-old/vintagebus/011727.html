Well I found a 23window ..62 bus for sale....What I need to know is what
is a reasonable price to pick it   up...Because in my search i have seen
some outrageous prices for these puppies...First the inside is shot and
would need to be completely redone...It only has front bench seat...no
headliner....interior wasted etc...Tranny is shot and motor keeps burning
out the points....Does have new brakes....Now the outside is in pretty
good shape but the nose is a little wrinkled and the rear aprons have
been redone and wasn't done too well...As far as rust it is minimal...of
course there is some on the rocker panels and floor....and a few spots of
bondo...Has a bad paint job...but that's no biggie. I am thinking around
2500$ - 3500$.Sound about right?..Let me know.

Greg
