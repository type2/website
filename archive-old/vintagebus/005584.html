Actually, I'm now looking at the &quot;quick disconnect&quot; fittings posited by some
people earlier in the thread.  I found an internet site for a manufacturer
of these fittings the other day and emailed them regarding suitability on a
bus, I kind of expected the answer I got which was something like &quot;we can't
answer your question 'cuz it isn't a boat (liability)&quot;.

I am currently envisioning a single quick disconnect fitting of the Mariner
type between two rubber lines in front [FIF] of the engine, previously a
single line that ran from the tank to the metal line in the engine
compartment.  In the course of looking at my options, I also found a marine
fuel-hose manufacturer's site.  I remember a thread either on vintagebus or
on RAMVA regarding durability of the German hose with all the additives in
our fuel these days.  The marine hoses specifically state they are designed
to withstand fuel additives including methanol (which is the primary
additive in auto gas(?)), and they are warranted for five years.  I figure
on using 1/4&quot; marine hose as well as the quick disconnects.  My '66 Bug came
equipped with 1/4&quot; hose courtesy of the PO, and it fit plenty tight despite
being a hair bigger ID than the metric.  And these marine hoses aren't just
rubber with cloth, they're layered composite thingies and everything plus a
nifty red racin' strip down the side to make my bus go faster :-)

I really need to drop by a marine shop to see what connectors I want to use
first-hand, but how does this sound overall?  One more crazy college
student, or a feasible idea?  Seems like I could make engine removal nice
and clean, and improve the longevity and safety of my fuel lines at the same
time!  Plus no vice grips ;-)

&gt; I wouldn't put a shut off valve on the forward side of the metal there,
and
&gt; next ownere (NO?) may not know it was there.
