Subject: Re: [VB] Question re: headlight bucket color

Back in April a listmember reported using Rustoleum Stone Grey spray paint on
his buckets, and he said that it was a pretty good match if nothing else was
available.

&gt; Subject: Question
&gt;
&gt; I had a rather detailed question I was hoping you could help me with.  It
&gt; concerns my 65 21 window.
&gt;
&gt; I am in the process of refurbishing my headlight buckets.  I need to
&gt; repaint the inside of the headlight bucket and want to get the correct
&gt; color.  Wolfsburg West has a paint L91 &quot;Chrome Color&quot;; is this the correct
&gt; color?
