Subject: Re: Solex Throttle Bushing Replacement?
Message-ID: &lt;3714FFB6.4EFDEA74_at_datacom_dot_ca&gt;

I have this kit and have used it to rebuild dual solexes on a couple of dual
carbed buses, and a dual carb type 3......  it makes a big difference....

I don't have the address but it is manufactured by Shley Products Inc......
Part Number 84120  I know that a lot of parts places carry Shley Products... if
they do, they may be able to order the kit for you...

Basically the kit consists of a 10mm drill bit, a stop for the drill bit (so
you don't drill in too far), a bushing installer ( almost looks like a small
clutch alignment tool... it fits the inner diameter of the new bushing, and and
steps out to press on the end of the bushing....) and  8 wide bushing (8mm) and
i think 8 narrow bushings ( 3mm)

The one thing lacking in the kit is an 8 mm Reamer... to size the bushing
accurately to the diameter of the throttle shaft......this is very
important....

Basically when you disassemble the carbs, you remove the throttle butterflies,
then take a screw driver and pop out the old bushings, along with a little
nylon sleeve which doesn't do much anyway because it is worn out by now
anyway....  all the dual carbs that I have done use the the narrow 3mm bushings
on both sides when I rebushed mine I used the wider bushings.........you use
the supplied drill bit to drill out where the old bushing was to bring it out
to the size of the outer diameter of the new bushings ( there is a slight
interference fit....) making sure to use the collar ( set for the width of the
bushing to be used) as not to drill out too much....  once it is drilled out on
either side ( use a drill press.... it makes it much easier...), press in the
new bushings..... then with the reamer, ream the new bushings to size, making
sure to do both sides at once to have them both aligned or binding will
occur... then reassemble.....  i also greased up the throttle shaft at the
bushing to help lubricate things....   and when reinstalling the throttle
butterflies.... be sure to use locktite on the screws.. you don't want them to
come loose and fall into the engine......

I hope this helps everyone out......... if there is anymore questions, feel
free to ask.....

&gt; Quoting an old message from the archive:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;18: Archway Imports (a parts place in St. Louis) lists in their
&gt; &gt;19: catalog a &quot;Solex Carb/Bushing Kit&quot; which looks from the picture
&gt; &gt;20: to be a drill bit, a reamer, and some bushings.  I imagine
&gt; &gt;21: you would need a drill press to make sure it was square.  They
&gt; &gt;22: also sell just bushings (8 and 3mm, where they go I know not).
&gt; &gt;23:
&gt; &gt;24: The tool kit (item # 2050) is $55, the bushings (8mm: #2051,
&gt; &gt;25: 3mm #2052) are $2.  I haven't used this kit, and don't
&gt; &gt;26: even know if it's the appropriate thing.  Archway's #
&gt; &gt;27: is XXX-XXX-XXXX.
&gt;
&gt; But I called and this kit is discontinued. Does anybody have a mail order
&gt; source for the reamer and the bushings for a 34-3? My wife's bus is leaking
&gt; from the accelerator pump linkage.
