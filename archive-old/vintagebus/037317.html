&lt;&lt; the extra weight on the top of the shifter would change depending on how 
big of arm was pulling the shifter around, and how much jewelry was on the

nothing to do with it.  maybe im missing something? &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Well this is the reason VW warns not to use the stick shift as a hand rest!  
Picture this you you decide to go to the beach and play that old Limbo game 
of seeing who can get under the lowest stick held by two folk.  Now imagine 
trying to do this while wearing that bowling ball earring.  Now picture you 
stick shift in fourth.  Notice it leans backward?  So the more wieght at the 
top of the shifter, the more the shifter parts in the tranny wear out.

PS Those short shift devises probably would do the same damage in the end.
