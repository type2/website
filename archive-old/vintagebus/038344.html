This is a bit of a ramble about my weekend with my motor, but there's some questions at the end:

Well, I'm a little closer to being ready to head on out to Tennessee.  I've decided to devote weekends to bus stuff, and I even have a tarp set up in case of rain, which of course it always does.  I found a cool way to attach a tarp to my drip-rail: I'm using those small window locks used to keep your house windows from opening, but with a bigger thumbscrew which goes through the grommet on the tarp.  Also the new screws don't have pointy ends on them so they don't gouge up the raingutter quite so much, although this is no show bus.
Saturday I had taken off the alternator, fan shroud, oil cooler, intake manifold, heater boxes, and engine tin. I think I'm going to leave the distributor alone.

Yesterday morning I headed outside to uncover the motor and clean it.  I lifted the board that I had leaned up against the tarp-covered motor and found two giant black beetles underneath.  Hmm... beetles attracted to my bus... there seems to be some strange forces at work here. 

Anyway, I cleaned the motor with some kind of citrusy solvent engine cleaner, then sprayed it off.  Since I had already taken off the intake manifold, it was a little tricky to not get a bunch of water in the motor, but I managed pretty well (I think) with the help of rags and duct tape.  Hopefully no permanent damage.

A few findings: almost none of the bolts and screws I removed were tightened up, as in they were practically falling off in most cases, and sometimes missing altogether. Found one broken stud where the heater box attaches on the left, also one of the screws holding the piece of engine tin that covers the pushrod tubes is broken off in the case.  It appears that the area where the screw is broken has been ground down, for what reason I can't figure out.

Finally got everything all cleaned off and even painted the engine tin fluorescent pink. As if.  It's flat black Tremclad.   

So I guess the motor is ready to go on a trip.  I think I'm going to make some kind of wheeled platform for it for easy maneuvering, since I have to get it into the middle of a full size school bus for the trip.

Any suggestions in terms of motor transportation would be greatly appreciated: are there any stupid things I might do that should be avoided?  Can the motor be stood on its side on the valve cover or will that damage something?

Also, I hate to admit it but I think some water may have gone down the intake hole on one side.  Is there anything I can do to allow it to flow out of the motor if this is the case or do I just hope it starts in a month?

So, next weekend I'm on to starter, shifter and shift rod removal.  33 days to departure.
Happy bussin'
