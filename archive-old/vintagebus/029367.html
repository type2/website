If ANYONE has a copy of &quot;Locally Fabricated Tools&quot; I'd love to scan it and
host it on the Unofficial WetWesties Website &lt;http://wetwesties.tripod_dot_com&gt;
along with the technical recommendation for Journeys Under Difficult
Conditions.  Would make the site just that much more informative.

TIA
