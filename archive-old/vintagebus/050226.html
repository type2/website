Subject: Convertable Steal!!! (Friday-ish Topic on Thanksgiving)

This is way off topic, but pretty funny nonetheless.

I saw a &quot;cute read VW convertable bug&quot; for sale in the Lubbock, TX thrifty
nickel for...$275!!!! &quot;This is it&quot; I tell my wife. &quot;Here's your
convertable!&quot;

My wife calls. After making sure the price is right she asks if the seller
can tell her about it. &quot;What do you want to know?&quot; the seller asks.  &quot;Well,
does it have an engine? Does it run? What kind of condition is it in?&quot; my
wife asks.

The seller then says &quot;Well, it's battery powered.&quot; Turns out its one of
those little battery powered kiddy toys! Oh well, I new it was too good to
be true. My wife wished the seller happy Thanksgiving &amp; promptly got off
the phone:)
