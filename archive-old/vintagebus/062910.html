Subject: RE: [VB] Safari Windows

  C E Safaris use tempered not laminated. When I talked to Dave (C E owner)
he says the tempered will not crack like the laminated do. Tempered glass
can flex more then laminated. Most (all) safaris that use laminated seem to
crack long before the tempered. Many people are parnoid of the tempered
becase they shatter instead of cracking. When I was on a OZ site they
explained how they still use tempered instead of laminated because you have
less chance of injury when you fly threw a tempered windshield verses the
laminated one that doesn't shatter.

I seem to recall complaints that the reproduction safaris were cracking the
glass and leaking real bad. Do the CE safaris solve these problems??
