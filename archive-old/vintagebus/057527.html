Subject: Re: [VB] PaintScratch_dot_com satisfaction

A local auto paint supplier put a water resevoir-sized 
cordless device on my doublecab and made up two rattle 
cans of paint for me. With a can of self-etching primer 
the bill was $32. 
In an earlier post I told of the quart of enamel house 
paint matched to a radio block off at Home Despot to 
patch up a rough dove blue camper. $8 as I remember. The 
code should be in the earlier message under a search 
for &quot;Behr&quot;. 
At this year's BYOB someone was selling rattle cans of 
interior colors. Don't know the cost.

&gt; Thought I would give everyone a quick update on paintscratch_dot_com. As a 
&gt; backgrounder I ordered two touchup paint bottles from them for my Sealing wax 
&gt; Red/ Beige Grey Bus.
