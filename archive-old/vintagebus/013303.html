Ellis has the Safaris, Ambo fan and 110 degree heat. Tried the simultaneous
Safaris and ambofan action in the barndoor enroute to Phx from the Classic.
It was like pouring water into a glass underwater. (Can't tell the difference)!

A true Desert Rat will tell you that from 105 degrees and up you'd probably
keep the safaris shut and the side windows mostly shut to keep the blast
furnace wind out of your face. Sounds crazy but it is about the truth. If
anyone has ever worked at a Pizza parlor, done a Cone 10 firing in a
ceramics class, or lived in Southern Arizona, SE California, Southern NM,
ElPaso in the Summer then you'd know the feeling.
