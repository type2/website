 For what it is worth John got the sunroof section and the BD roof clip from 
 me.  The sunroof came off a deluxe that was rusted a foot above the rockers 
 and had almost no floor.&gt;&gt;

That is why I am totally for people cutting sunroofs in half when parting out 
a bus. So others can't get crafty.

  &lt;&lt;NQ and Lafoon can vouch for that.  The BD clip came 
 of a picked over salvage yard bus with virtually no nose due to rust and a 
 diamond plate cargo floor. &gt;&gt;

I don't think many people are worried as to the condition of the BD or the 
deluxe that the parts came from (who would cut up those sorta vehicles when 
there is a foreign market), rather a little upset that a perfectly good bus 
was molested.
 
 &lt;&lt;John's previous two finished projects, '56 Oval &amp; a '59 Single cab, were 
both 
 HVW's cover cars...he don't make junk.&gt;&gt;

Opinion.

  &lt;&lt;He bought the '59 single cab from me 
 too.  Many would have passed on restoring it due to the amount of rust.  
 Instead John made it a sweet truck.  Custom may not be your thing but if it 
 is, Johns the man.-Dan &gt;&gt;
  
Lots of people have a different definition for the word restoring, but 
regardless, he did put a lot of work into it.
