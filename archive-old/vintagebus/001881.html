Hi all -
    I've been on the type2 list for a couple of years now, and my 71 Westy
and I are seriously indebted to this community.  So... Now I am the new
owner of a 65 EZ Camper, ready to start tearing it down, I think.  I live in
CT, where I am exempt on emissions testing for my 71 Westy because of the 25
year rule.  However, I have heard rumors that CT will soon be toughening the
standards, and lifting exemptions.  I was wondering if any other list
members in other states have had this happen already, and if there was any
kind of grandfather clause for vehicles already deemed exempt.  To pass
safety, I would need to get windshield washer fluid pumping, and do some
brake work.  The bus runs well, and I was thinking of trying to get it
through inspection before I really begin the resurrection.  Currently, in
CT, once you've passed Safety, you're done until the car gets sold, and then
the new owner takes it through again.  Emissions exempt sticker just needs
to renewed every two years.

Just looking for some opinions.

 Many , many more questions to come over the next couple of years.  Looking
for any info on this conversion as well(EZ out of Little Rock CA) .  Saw
brochure in library - Thanks Rusty!
