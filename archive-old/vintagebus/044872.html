 the steering tube/column with the 2 screws and it will not turn off when the 
 wheel goes straight.  It is in the same location as my other switch that 
 turned off fine.  Is there a diff w/ the 12v 67 and 6v 66 turnsignal switch, 
 both have the exact harness and part numbers.
  &gt;&gt;
the 66 and 67 switches should be exactly the same.

sometimes it helps to wrap tape around the steering column before attaching 
the switch to tube.

why are you replacing the switch?   maybe the headlight high beam problem is 
in the black box?   do make sure everything is hooked up right.  One annoying 
thing I found is that VW did change some of the wires colours in that time, 
and some of the 66/67 switches have one colour pattern, some another, so they 
dont all match the wiring diagram. um, but it is only a few of the wires that 
are changed.  Download you the 66/67 wiring diagram from vintagebus_dot_com.
