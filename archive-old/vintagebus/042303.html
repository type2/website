Yep.
Completely by design. (not mine, but the company who runs it.;)

It is there to prevent all of the damn web crawlers and robots (and even
the people who do it by hand..) from gaining acces to our subscribers
email addresses....  this is Good Thing, as it keeps much of the junk mail
out of your hair.;p

OTOH, I'm sorry about the one or two ya'll may have gotten.  One of the
shell users on the temporary machine got into the adress databases...and
promply had their ears, hands, eyes, and toes removed by the folks who
really run that machine.


As for digests arriving late...I'll look into that real quick.

later...david
