&gt; &gt; Hm, my sources say the shift tube was installed for bus vin 306 726.  I
&gt; guess
&gt; &gt; not.  both are type 22?  interesting?  what kind of camper kit does the
&gt; &gt; camper have.
&gt; &gt; Does the sunroof bus have a golde sunroof?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had a 59 bus w/ body number, thopugh was 'supposed' to have vin tag as
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; 150 000 buses before, so whatever.    Body number what does it mean- a
few
&gt; &gt; things are listed by body number as well as by vin, but not many.
&gt; doesn't
&gt; &gt; mean much

&gt; &gt;  The bus in question has a VIN number of 295464(eng. compartment), and a
&gt; body
&gt; &gt;  number of 273477 (behind fr. seat).  Neither bus has an M-code tag, but
&gt; on
&gt; &gt;  the metal tag in the eng. compartment it has a type number of VW2/22.
&gt; It's
&gt; &gt;  actually a 9 seater, full front, middle, and rear seats (middle folds
&gt; down
&gt; &gt;  on the end)- sorry, I think I said it was an 8 seater before. Both vans
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;  tubes for the shift rod.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     What significance does the body number have? Can anything be
&gt; determined
&gt; &gt;  by it?

&gt; &gt;  &gt; ya- Dan has a point there-  is the number you wrote the one from the
&gt; &gt;  engine
&gt; &gt;  &gt; compartment?  the one in the engine room is the VIN
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; one is a very late 58, as July 31st/ VIN 375 089 is the model year
&gt; change
&gt; &gt;  &gt;  ( or is it 384  875 at the bumper change?)   Does the later one have
a
&gt; &gt;  body
&gt; &gt;  &gt; number stamped behind the passenger side of the front seat?   It may
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;  an
&gt; &gt;  &gt; m code tag.
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; The earlier one, it doesn't have a tube for the shift rod, right?
&gt; Under
&gt; &gt;  the
&gt; &gt;  &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; The earlier one should have the rare flat decklid, while the later
one
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;  &gt; mid 58 through later 64 decklid
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; I am a bit confused by fascination of wanting factory codes.  That
&gt; earlier
&gt; &gt;  &gt; bus has codes for standard with sunroof, ambulance divider, from what
&gt; you
&gt; &gt;  &gt; say.   8 seater- then it would have code for 2/3 middle seat (9
seaters
&gt; &gt;  has
&gt; &gt;  &gt; three rows of seats for three- meaning full front seat and full
middle
&gt; &gt;  seat-
&gt; &gt;  &gt; 7 seater has walkthrough front seat (hard to fit ambulance divider)
and
&gt; &gt;  2/3
&gt; &gt;  &gt; middle seat.)
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Sounds like a couple neat buses,   any pics?
