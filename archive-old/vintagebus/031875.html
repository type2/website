I still use my Miller 300 tig (15 years old) and WORE out my Lincoln,
Stepped up and bought a Hobart commercial, duel wire drive and variable wire
and heat. As for a small welder Lincoln I think is the best, as does my
welding supplier (who sells both brands). Better then the small Miller and a
few more features. Stay AWAY from Century, Taiwan parts, low duty cycles and
hard to get parts. FWIW, Snap-On welders are Century and I burnt my Snap-On
welder out in 6 months (alas, that was when I bought my first Lincoln). If
you search the internet on welders they are some dealers who sell Hobart,
Lincoln and Miller at a few dollars above wholesale.

I have to agree with Cameron here. I was lucky enough to pick up a used 250
size complete with bottle in $600 range, and it is the best ive ever used.
From variable heat control to spot and stitch options, it does it all, with
never a problem.  Plan on spending the extra money for a quality unit, and
you will be thanking us for recomending it.  I don't think you will find a
person out there who has spent a little more than they planned on by
upgrading to a better unit and is displeased.
