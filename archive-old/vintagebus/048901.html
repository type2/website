Well, I've been putting off installing the headliner in the '65 DC for several months now.  I finally decided to bite the bullet last weekend, albeit in the midst of cutting up 180 bed slats.  I guess when I decide to get busy I go for it.  I had purchased said headliner from Wolfsburg West.

This might be a common knowledge trick, but at the time I was installing the headliner I didn't know it.  The headliner is cut to fit pretty snug along the roofline, so there isn't much room for play.  Plus, you're trying to handle this monster piece of cardboard without bending or breaking it.  As we all know, the shape of our bus roofs is a gradual &quot;U&quot; shape.  The large rear section of headliner is the toughest to install.  First, insert one side into the lip along the roofline.  Then instead of trying to form a &quot;U&quot; shape with the headliner and insert the other side (which BTW is virtually impossible), form an &quot;S&quot; shape.  By that I mean bring the center of the piece *back down* and then at the same time take the opposite side back up forming an &quot;S&quot;.  Then all you have to do is slip the other end into the lip at the roofline and pop the &quot;S&quot; up against the roof.  Viola!  It's in!

Anyway, it worked for me.  If this is second grade stuff I apologize to you third graders.  Hope it helps someone.

Robert
