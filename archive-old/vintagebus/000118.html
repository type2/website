Someone I know here in Albuquerque has a '63 (or someone said it's a '64) 
Standard for sale.  He's in the military, so it has to go before the new 
year.  It sounds like a good enough deal - $1000 - running - not much rust 
(we are in the desert).  It's White over Turquoise (too busy to look up exact 
color).  Call Bill at 505-262-9165.  That's all I know.
