Hi all,
I would like to thank everyone for all their help in answering some of my
questions about my new 65 Terrapin, until my Bentley and owners manual
arrived.

One thing that didn't make the list was What was the speed set for on a 1500
governor?  The answer according to Bentley is 65 mph or 105 kph in top gear.
And speaking of the governor.  Everyone told me to pull mine off and make it
easier.  I would like to keep mine but it is still missing the cover.  If
everyone seems to pulling theirs off there must be a spare someone would be
willing to sell :)

Please let me know as I would like the original cover instead of trying to
make one and hope it fits right.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
