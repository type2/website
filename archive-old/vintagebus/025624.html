The original westy curtain rods are very nice, if not easy to find. They
are made of extruded aluminum stipping, and have a cool little fold in
teh middle where it allows the curtains toi overlap for privacy where
they meet.

You can find this exact same material in longer pieces in late model
westfalias, which in my experience are much easier to find in junk
yards/ parts places. The rods are longer, so you have to cut them to
size and carefully bennd them to work, but they are very much the same.

Any sort of thin metal stock properly bent should work. I would avoid
the cheapo-holloow curtain rods available at K-mart and teh like. They
do not hold up.
I have seen also many folks use very long springs that are attached with
screws, to make sort of a flexible, but taught, curtain rod.

If you are putting curtains in a kombi, there are no rules for correct,
as there were never curtains in them stock. So do what looks best.
