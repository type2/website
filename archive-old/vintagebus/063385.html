Subject: Re: [VB] turn signal switch / headlight switch conflict

&gt;From: Thomas Bassler &lt;THOMASB_at_bayley_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Just bought the 9 pin unit from WW and go everything connected right. Turn
&gt;signals work, emergency flasher works, got my headlights/parking lights
&gt;working properly.  Problem: Turn signals don't work with headlight and/or
&gt;parking switch on.

Check the grounds at your tail lights.  If the grounds are bad, the
stop/turn (bright) filament will ground through the park (dim) filament
when the parking lights are off, so the brake lights and turn signals
will kind of work.  When the parking lights are on, the stop/turn
filament can't ground and there may not be enough load from the front
bulbs to trigger the turn signal flasher.

Other than that, you might compare your Bus to the wiring diagram for
your year at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring and make sure everything
is connected correctly.

Good luck!
