&lt;&lt;Subject line says it all.  So that I don't take up bandwidth, it is in very 
good to excellent condition and complete.  It is ALL original, nothing 
reproduced.  Both hoops and hoop caps, center strap and canvas.  No missing 
hardware, no tears in the canvas, and no significant staining.  A hard to 
find score.

Pmail questions and price info, trades are welcomed but I don't need much.  
Pics available.  Thanks.
