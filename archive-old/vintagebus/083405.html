Hi,

Don't know anything about the bus, however could you measure the clearance 
inside the rear hatch? I am always on the lookout for units produced by 
Kamper Kits. Their hallmark is enough space through the hatch, tipped up at 
the diagonal, for an american sheet of plywood at 4 feet wide (1.22 meters). 
I believe that all other manufacturers had wide closets on the passenger 
side which precluded that utility.

&gt; Definately not Westfalia, some bits were in the style of a Westfalia but 
&gt; the
&gt; overall quality was poor.  Add that to many years of abuse and I really
&gt; srarted with an empty shell.
