&gt;i am very interested in joining a club. the problem is i have heard some
&gt;negative things about some (soto namley) of the clubs and would


Join NEATO. The publication (Old Bus Review) is worth the price of admission
and is published REGULARLY! There is a Texas chapter of NEATO, Lone Star
Transporter Association, c/o Erny Matthews, P.O. Box 687, VanAlstyne, TX
75495, 903-482-0192. Many, many members of NEATO are members in good
standing of this list, most notably Dave Easterwood who continues to publish
the OBR against all odds.
