Subject: OT:  Eddie Van Halen
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For those of you that saw Eddie at the Octo show in October (I think) and saw 
how freaking OLD he looked, I heard today that he's having a birthday today 
and he's turning............(drumroll)...........46.

46?!?!  I would have bet big $ that he was well on his way to 60 based on his 
looks that day

Poor Eddie...............hopefully his new bus (if he bought one) well help 
him age a bit better.
