Subject: A weird brake question.
References: &lt;200007101611.JAA32376_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I am in need of some of the great list knowledge. My 60 crew cab has a weird thing going on in the brakes. It pulls to the right when you first step on the brakes. It stops pulling very quickly, even though you still have the brakes on. If I step on the brakes again right away it does not pull. If I wait about 5 minutes the first time I step on the brakes it pulls again. I thought I was dripping a small amount of brake fluid and that was causing
the pull. I have seen no noticeable drop in fluid. Also after adjusting the brakes and the pedal being nice and high, it will drop to about half way down within about a 2 week span. It is not spongy just low. Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Craig
