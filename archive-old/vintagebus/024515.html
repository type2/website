Okay, this is a Me Too on the cleaning battery connections. 

When I lived in Logan, UT, temps would be below 0 deg. F. most mornings
throughout the winter, with a 2 week period that would be -20F or less.
My winter prep routine was oil change (lighter weight), complete tune
up, and pull/clean battery cables on both ends. By doing this, I could
reliably start my Bus w/1600cc &amp; 1647cc DP engines, 12v system down to
-15F. Below that took about 3 mins with battery charger to warm battery
and blow dryer to the carb.

Making this part of the autumn routine is ideal for cooler climes, since
the starting system is more stressed in the winter *and* it's a more
miserable time to be stranded. I've gotten less diligent since moving to
Salt Lake, as winters are milder. I think I'll do the winter routine
today.

-SNIP FROM BEGINNING-
&gt; battery in about 2 1/2 years ago.  Things corrode, particularly in a damp
&gt; climate.   Maybe I should put that on the do every  year  list.   Cleaning the
&gt; battery terminal a few years ago doesn't count.    Thanks, Joe.
&gt; 
&gt; So yous alls- clean your connections, particularly if you have 6V buses.
&gt; FWIW, the 54  I used to have had really bright lights- you could see the
&gt; semaphore light up in the daytime.   I was asked if it was 12V, because of the
&gt; brightness, but no it was 6V and my ex had cleaned -all- the connections.
