&gt; We're all sticking
&gt; engines in these engine bays with doghouse cooling systems and larger
&gt; displacements increasing the CFM requirements of the motors, but we just
&gt; aren't increasing the ability of the air being able to get INTO the engine
&gt; bay.
&gt; 

hello Eric  That is my findings also . When increasing the CFM you will need 
to increase the air going in.  What I did was to remove the heat hoses and run 
hoses from under the sides of the engine into the compartment , no heat but I 
dont use this bus for winter .  I guess the next thing will be to add more 
vents  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
