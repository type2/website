&gt; Hopefully a simple question for any California listees..I am
purchasing a bus in California ( it is titled and insured ) and I will
be driving up to the great white north ( Canada ) Where do I get the
trip permit and how much? Also is there a problem because I'm not
switching the title in California? Thanks. Oh ya I'll be travelling up
the I-5 so If you are close and at home and have hot coffee let me
know. 

If the bus is registered, just get in it and go!  You have 10 days to
drive it in Cal before it has to be transferred to your name.

Even if not registered, I'd be tempted to just drive off.  The chances
of being ticketed for expired registration are relatively small,
particularly if you have a recently dated bill of sale.  The fine is
fairly stiff (~$200) if the cop is nasty, so you have to make your
choice yourself.  Does the GWN have reciprocity with the Left Coast?

If the bus looks &quot;normal&quot; and you drive sensibly you shouldn't have
any problems.

Of course, you can go to the &quot;horse's mouth&quot;:

But don't expect to find it easily!  The California DMV isn't in the
business of giving out information!
