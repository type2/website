Both of these wires come from the hot side of the coil (not the points
side!)  You can make a wire that hooks to one of the free spades on the
coils and then Y's to two spade terminals for the choke and idle cutoff.

&gt; Have a carburetor question
&gt; 
&gt; I have just removed dual weber 34's and installing a single carb. A solex
&gt; 34. I need to know how/where to hook up a couple of things. I have no
&gt; current wires for the carb, so I need to set it up. Where does the wire to
&gt; the choke come from? Where does the wire to the air bypass come from. Please
&gt; help me so I can get this set up correctly.
