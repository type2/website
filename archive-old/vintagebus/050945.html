&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I am just about  ready to print the stickers up.  I have placed the 
&gt; artwork file on thesamba_dot_com gallery.  It's listed under 'listee sticker'.
&gt; 
&gt; I like the way they turned out...so i hope you guys feel the same.  
&gt; 
&gt; If everyone like this one...I will begin working on a similar Baywindow bus 
&gt; sticker.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll keep you guys updated.
