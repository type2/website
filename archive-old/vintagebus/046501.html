Hello everyone,
Since it's the new year, I figured I'd start with an odd inquiry.
I was wondering if anyone can shed some light on m-code 145. It's listed as a 
sliding door safety latch.
My 63 hardtop deluxe has this m-code, but no sliding door to latch.
I did a search on Thom's vintagebus registry and it came up with (4) buses 
that have this particular feature. They also all happen to be deluxes and all 
1963's, (2) 241's and (2) 251's. Coincidence?? What the heck does it all 
mean? And why do I have one of these!!
If anyone has a clue please let me know.
Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes

I have M 145 listed as &quot;with safety lock for sliding door&quot; - type 211    in a 
parts list.  perhaps as yours is not a type 21, this designation may mean 
something else... 

just an idea
