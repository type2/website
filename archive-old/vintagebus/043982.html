I'm not sure how this could happen???????????
I found a 25th Anniversary Edition Muir compleat idiots manual in a box
that was put into a recycle bin!!!!!!
What is this world coming to.  Or is it the result of some significant
others wrath????  Too much herb?????  A soul pushed over the edge crying
for help??  what?
Who does that on purpose, really?
I normally never do a Friday topic, but......
later
