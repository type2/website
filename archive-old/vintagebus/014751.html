Subject: belly pans and rust prevention

Hello Listmembers,

After viewing robert king's webpage:

http://pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/

and checking out the pix of the belly pans he fabricated and installed on 
his '59 deluxe, I had a thought, I know that the pans were installed on 
models that had the sunroof to increase rigidity due to the lack of a solid 
roof.  Do the belly pans help to prevent frame, and cargo floor rust by 
shielding the frame from the elements, or do they just create more grief 
(corrosion-wise) by keeping any water that gets between the plates and the 
frame stagnant?  Thoughts and experiences from deluxe owners out there?

Just curious,

Mike Anderson
'64 rolling shell Kombi (no belly pans)
