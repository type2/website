Thursday morning of last week, I woke up with a sore dry throat - you
know...one of those sore nasal type jobbies.  I went to work anyway and that
night my throat was even worse.  Friday morning it was definitely time to
call in and so I've had a nice 4 day weekend of which 3.5 days of it were
spent lolly gagging around the house doing such fun things as surfing,
copying songs to my empeg player, vomiting, hacking up more crap, etc.

Why do I tell you all this - well, it's my excuse for allowing a problem
with my bus to go untouched for a couple of days. :-)

Friday evening I managed to cruise out to Walmart and eat at their little
in-house cafe.  Just as I pulled out of the backyard, I heard a scraping and
grinding noise from the front right tire area.  I suspected a bad bearing
because I could make the noise get louder and softer by wiggling the wheel
back and forth.  The bus sat in the driveway Sat., Sun., and Monday until
about 3:00 when I decided I felt good enough to take it over to the shop and
work on it.  As it turns out, after I removed the drum, the top spring that
holds the brake shoes together had snapped off on the end.  I don't know
what caused this but these are the brand new springs you get in the kits.  I
know the old stock springs that were on this bus were made of a thicker
guage metal.  I scrounged through my old pile of brake stuff and found me a
spring.  I buffed it on the wire wheel and installed it, and to make a
longer story shorter, I put everything back together, adjusted the
headlights for the heck of it, and drove around town tonight for abot 40
minutes - problem solved.

I guess I could throw in the part about adjusting the link pins and greasing
the front end.  It took a little more grease but not much. It's only got
over 600 miles on it - all the tie-rod ends are still just as good as when
they went in - link pins weren't loose at all, so over all, everything seems
fine.

All fer now...
