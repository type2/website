Several of you have wanted to see pix of my bus, however all I have
currently are those pix that were taken in the past and put on my page. I
took some pix after I brought the bus home but I haven't gotten those
developed yet.  So here are the old pic URL's.  I'm taking more pictures
documenting the work on the bus so I'll have a nice documentary as the rolls
are shot, developed, and scanned in.  Until then, check these out.  You'll
also see the T4 oil cooler conversion I did on my engine before the
powdercoating.
