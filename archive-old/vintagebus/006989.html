Costco must be higher priced in your area, in the Phoenix and Las Vegas
Costco's they are 149.95 and Big K-Mart also has the same covers for 175.00
sans back and sides.

You can get a nice little single-car shelter _at_ CostCo for ~$200;
you can even order it online and get it delivered for a little extra.
I bought one, and it's getting ready for it's second winter.
