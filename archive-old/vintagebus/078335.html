Subject: Freedom Camper

So, I just recieved the original bill of sale for my '67 bus.

Apparently, it's a &quot;Freedom Camper&quot;.

Anybody know anything about this?  

Searching the archives didn't bear much fruit other than that there may 
have been only 50 of these puppies produced.

I have all the interior pieces, but none of it is really installed and I 
not completely sure where all of it goes -- although I have a good idea. 
(I would fault the PO, but the crushed blue velvet he installed *is* nice).

Anywho...
    Tom
