Hi all,

I will be heading out to Phoenix that weekend and am wondering which of the
two days is the better day to show up for.  While &quot;Jack&quot; ('59 samba) will
only be there in spirit, my girlfriend and I are planning to show up and
would love to meet some of the people on the list.  Are the any other So.
Cal volks headed over?  I'll look for you all on the road Friday night.

Thanks,
Aaron
