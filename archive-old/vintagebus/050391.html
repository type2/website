Dear Brad,

I'm really rusty on this but I can't help jumping in, based only on my distant
memories of similar experiences.

If your engine is roaring away, it because the throttle is wide open.  The way
I see it, this is not a choke problem.  If it was the choke, the engine would
be bubbling and stuttering and stalling out at idle because your mixture would
be way too rich.  The choke only adjusts your air-fuel mixture.  Effects of the
 choke on engine rpm are only incidental, as the mixture changes.

However, I do believe the problem is choke related and here's why: On my bus
(before I parked it, shame on me),  I would frequently have a similar problem.
 It occurred when the stepped cam that is connected to the choke shaft on the
left side of the carburetor, and is intended to adjust idle speed as the engine
 warms up, flips over backward and keeps the throttle arm from returning to the
 idle position.  This is prohbably the cam you mentioned.  The stepped cam is
supposed to be kept from &quot;flipping over&quot; by a tiny pin.  When the pin falls
out, the stepped cam can flip.  When it does, you have exactly the problem you
describe.

I got so used to this happening that I knew immediately what was going on and
could shut down without even waiting for the engine to reach full &quot;roar&quot;.

The way to fix it, as I recall, is to shut off the motor, Pull the throttle arm
 (with the idle adjsust screw on it) up and away from the cam with your left
hand, and flip the cam back over frontwards with your right hand.  Now, when
you release the throttle arm, the idle adjust screw should come to rest against
 the &quot;stepped&quot; side of the cam, as it should.

I hope this is helpful.
