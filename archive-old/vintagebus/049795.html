Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] NOT an oil thread, just a
 question!!!Walmart oil 	 at 92 cent...

&gt;In my opinion you could run the worst oil on the shelf and run fine as long
&gt;as the oil was changed every 3000 miles...  3000 miles should not come close
&gt;to breaking down the oil to the point of failure....  Unless your engine
&gt;runs waaaay too hot and then all bets are off.  As long as you stay around
&gt;or below 210 degrees you are fine.  Anything over 220 and I would seek more
&gt;aggressive cooling methods.



Once again overlooking that just because the oil temp sender shows 210 does
NOT mean that the oil doesn't get a lot hotter than that during its
circulation though the engine.  Think of the hot spots.  Cam lobes.
Bearings.  Hottest of all: exhaust valve stems.  The oil visits these spots
many times per mile.  How many visits to fry your cheapie oil?  I don't
know.  But $4 Mobil One is a helluvalot cheaper than the cheapest engine
rebuild.

P.S.  I pay $3.14 for Mobil One at one of the local Wal*Mart stores here in
Minnesota.
