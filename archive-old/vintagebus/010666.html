Hi Al,
Not if you carefully clean it and especially polish the rear end of the shaft 
behind the splines so the needle bearings in the flywheel gland bolt do not 
get destroyed with the crusty rust!  Also make sure to lightly grease this 
tip and regrease it every time you reinstall the engine so as to lubricate 
the tip and the needle bearings and keep them happy.  If you let the needle 
bearings run dry they will not last long and burn out allowing the rear tip 
of the input shaft to move up-down and side to side.  This in turn allows the 
clutch disc to randomly flopping around and touching the FW and clutch 
pressure plate surfaces making shifting an nasty problem due to the clutch 
not completely dissengaging!   Eric&amp;Barb
