[Original Message]

Can anyone please tell me how this 
occurs?

you answered your own question with your last 
sentence: &quot;It was sitting outside, we

did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze 
filters.&quot; rain/water entered through the air filter and #1 intake valve just 
happened to be the open one at the time.

I just cleared out what I believe is called water hammer from my no. 1. 
After a

two day hiatus my engine wouldn't turn and looking at things before I pull 
the

motor; some water drizzled out of my right valve cover and the moter 
wouldn't

turn past about 30-40 degrees BTDC so I pulled spark plug no.1 and the 
motor

turned to a gushing sound and there was water on the plug. I spun the 
motor

several times then replaced the plug and after some coaxing fired up and 
runs as

before. Can anyone please tell me how this occurs? It was sitting outside, 
we

did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze 
filters.
