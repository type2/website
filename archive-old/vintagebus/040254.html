Hi Rick: I agree with this:
&gt;
&gt;I have a number of split and bay busses (about 35).  I love to drive the
&gt;splitties for their coolness (is that a word?)  The splits have an &quot;air&quot;
&gt;about them that nothing else can come close to matching.  They look great,
&gt;are easy to work on, parts are fairly inexpensive and easy to get.  To put
&gt;it in a nutshell, driving a splity will just make you smile from ear to 
&gt;ear.
&gt;

And this:

&gt;But the &quot;big top&quot; bay window westy is wonderful for camping and long trips.
&gt;With disk brakes, a larger and longer life engine, ball joint front
&gt;supension and IRS rear, the bays will travel so much easier and faster.
&gt;You can't beat that huge bed on top!!



But I disagree with this:


&gt;(the type 4 ) will out last an &quot;upright&quot; type 1 engine twice as long.

So you will get 200,000 miles or more? My friends 69 lasted over 200,000 
miles. My engine is approaching 100,000. My friends with the type 4 (vw or 
porsche) are suffering from dropped valves at around 50 to 75000 miles. And 
they dont race them. My friend with a 1641 upright pushing a 1973 camper is 
looking at 300000 miles and has only had to replace rings.

I think that a blueprinted, carefully choosend head, specially oil cooled T4 
might be better, but it general I havent seen much advantage over a decent 
build upright.

Jason
