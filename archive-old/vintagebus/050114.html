Subject: Introduction

Hello all:

I just subscribed to the list.

I'm 41, and came of age during VW's biggest years in the U.S.  My mom
bought a new Bug in '65, and another in '70 (auto-stick).  My sister and
former bro in law bought a new Bug in '68, and a basic Westphalia in '70.
My first VW was a '63 standard 1500 Bus, which I acquired after rebuilding
the engine at the age of 15, and the (hippy) owner was unable to pay the
bill.  I bought a new Scirocco in '78, and I've owned nearly 100 VWs over
the years ('cause I used to part them out).

I presently own a '68 standard Beetle (1200cc) in the Philippines and a '66
SO42 Westphalia pop-top here in the States.  I joined this list because I'm
getting ready to restore my camper.  I've been accumulating some parts for
it, but it's really pretty complete.  I bought it about 15 years ago, when
it was absolutely rust-free (from Utah, but wearing a German dealer's
badge), but I let it sit outside for at least 5 years, and the rockers are
perforated now.  The bottom seams are solid, so I think the rockers can be
replaced easily at the body shop.  The only other welding will be to
replace the dash center section, since it was cut out by the previous owner
to install an 8-track (!) stereo.  I have a 6v AM/FM Saphire radio I want
to install.  The bus is now 12v, but I'm sick of double speed wipers,
improperly functioning turn signals, and other mysteries.  I'm accumulating
parts for the conversion back to 6v.  My interior is 99% complete and nice.
I recently acquired the child's cot, but I'm still searching for a few
items.

My shopping list:

Side tent, the big one with windows

Cap for the water tank

Dashboard center section

Front door panels

Speaker and speaker bracket

Driver's side door lock mechanism

Cab curtains

Battery hold down strap

Voltage regulator for the BIG 6v generator

Wiper shafts/bearings

Vent wing locks


I'm sure I'll need lots more stuff before I'm done, but that's what I know
of at the moment.  If anyone has the above stuff lying around, please email
me with your price...

I have probably rebuilt 15 VW engines over the years, and performed all
kinds of other repairs.  I'll try to help answer questions when I can.

Best regards,

Kabayo
