&gt;While i did have the motor running i did notice that my generator light
&gt;never went off.  That means either generator, regulator or wiring.

The connections at your speedometer are messed up.  When you mentioned
that your turn signal indicator was staying on, you said that the turn
signal bulb was grounded at the speedometer, which is wrong.  It needs
to be connected to the hot-with-key-on wire.

Here's a simple test.  Disconnect the generator light wire at the
regulator.  Ground the wire to bare metal on the body, or to the
engine case.  Go up front and turn the key on (don't start it)
and the generator light should be ON.  Turn the key off.  Go
around back, unground the generator light wire, and hook it to
the battery positive wire - an alligator clip jumper wire works
well, but don't let the clips ground out on anything!  Anyway,
after you have the wire connected to battery positive, go up
front again and turn the key on.  The generator light should
be OFF (or, worst case, glowing VERY dimly.)

I highly suspect that you will get the exact opposite results
(generator light OFF with wire grounded and ON with wire to
battery positive).  If that is true, I also suspect your oil
light isn't working either.  Fix the connection at your speedometer -
the common wire to the generator, oil, and turn signal lights that
is now grounded needs to connect to circuit 15 from the ignition
switch - and your troubles will be over.

&gt;Q. #1 The factory main cable from the battery (+) went both to the
&gt;starter and to the remote regulator in 1965.  I have not been able to
&gt;find a split cable that looked right so i went from the battery straight
&gt;to the starter with the main cable.  I then brought a cable back from
&gt;the battery to the regulator.  Any problems electrically with doing
&gt;that?

Nope.  My '64 is wired this way stock and it appears to be stock for
your '65 per the Bentley manual.  There is a heavy cable from battery
positive to the starter, and two thinner cables come off the same
connection on the starter - one to the regulator and one to the front
of the Bus.  Just make sure that the cable you added from the starter
to the regulator is thick enough - stock is 6 mm^2 which is at least
8 gauge AWG.  

&gt;Q. #2  I did take the regulator top off and check it out.  Asside from
&gt;some flakey clear stuff comming off the thin wire wraped in a square on
&gt;the bottom all looked OK.  I did clean up the contacts a little.  Might
&gt;that cause a charging problem?

Probably not, unless you really bent one of the contacts (like you
grabbed it with a pair of pliers and twisted it).  The flakey clear
stuff is probably varnish or insulation on the thin wire - as long
as it isn't smashed up against the metal case of the regulator or
against the inner fender when it's installed, it should be OK.

&gt;Q.#3.  How else could i check out the generator &amp; regulator?

There are a couple of ways, but I really think the trouble is up
at your speedometer.  Check that out and if it doesn't fix it,
let us know.
