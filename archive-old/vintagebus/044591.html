&lt;&lt; I installed new mounts on my 66. The front ones are the same for both
 the bug and the bus, the one on the rear is 211 301 265A and is used on
 the 63 to 67 bus. Hope this helps you. &gt;&gt;
Hi Clancy,
Do you not mean that the rear tranny mounts are the same for both type1 and 2.
While the front mount is 211 301 265A.   Remember front is toward the front
bumper, left is the driver (LHD) side.  Otherwise volks just get more and more
turned around trying to follow the directions given.
