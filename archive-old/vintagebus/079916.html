Rubber Johnny! Rubber Johnny!

Anyways, we're looking forward to Jerome.  Will head out either late Weds night or early Thurs morning and make our way to the Fu Rancho in Flagstaff.

Ricky and I were discussing a Saturday night community dinner and Sunday morning community breakfast.  Reminsicnent of Havasu the past two years, and have been tons of fun and good eatin'.

Any and all who are interested, p-mail me or Ricky and we'll start planning it out.

As for the camping, any with young kids will be welcome to meet up at Ricky's to caravan and camp together.  It has worked very well at the past two BBB's.  The kids play and we all kinda take turns keeping an eye on the kids to allow parents to wander off to swaps and raffles.  Has made campouts very enjoyable.  I have done several long show/trips sans wife with one or both of my girls and its tough.  Nice to get a break now and then.

&gt;   This year Jerome will be interesting as The heads of The Last Resort are not coming (where last years all nighter 
&gt; was held) but the naked dancing girls on the stage at 2 A.M. help set that mood!!!. 
&gt; Every year Jerome changes as to where the noise is and is unpredictable. You think you have chosen a guiet spot but 2 
&gt; camps down turns into all night, party central, rubber Johnneys (just ask Van Bondo about that).
