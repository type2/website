Hi Scott,
Sounds like you need to find another shop!  We just had 17 15&quot; bus rims 
sandblasted, zinc primer coated, semigloss black on the inner sides and 
Chamelion on the fronts that looks pretty close to Pearl White for $35.00 
each.  All we had to do was to degrease them, take off the clips, and make 
sure they were straight.  Next time though we are going to have the parts 
acid dipped, zinc plated and then powercoated.  Especially for parts like pop 
out windows and safrais where there are just so many nooks and crannies for 
rust to hide in.
