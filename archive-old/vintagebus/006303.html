&gt; Could be but actually mine was built in Nov of 57 and to get on another
topic that I don't recall is... is my bus a 58 or 57 model year?
&gt;
According to my NEATO book, the 1958 model year started August 1, 1957.  You
are correct in that the model years do vary at times.  The &quot;standard&quot; August
model yearing schema began in August, 1955 with 1956 vehicles, thus many
people consider '55s more scarce due to the reduced model year (Jan-August).
