 Thosr are brazilian buses.  Basically, VW sent all the tooling to VW do 
Brasil
 when they were done with it, and the Brazilians made buses with whatever
 they had handy.  Those buses have &quot;deluxe&quot; rear-ends, early bay front
 ends, and *barndoor* cargo doors!  They also have upright engines
  &gt;&gt;
the cargo doors on the brasialian buses are high hinge and have the same 
mechanisms as BDs, and look like BD cargo doors, EXCEPT  they are reinforced 
much much better.  The BD cargo doors are really flimsy.
