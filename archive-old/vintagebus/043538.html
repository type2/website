&gt;Matt and I both have 1960 DD panels here in Havasu, his was built 30,000
&gt;before mine. We both have M-code 360 (U S spec according to Thom's site),
&gt;but his has M-code 175 also (overrider bumpers) but mine doesn't and it
&gt;came with over rider bumpers. So the question is? Did VW include override
&gt;bumpers as a standard item in the late 60's as part of the U S spec
&gt;package?

Real experience should probably take precedence over book learnin', but
here's an interesting tidbit...

M 175  Rammschutz  211-244, 271-274
M 176  Rammschutz  261-264  (Exportlaender)

A literal translation of &quot;Rammschutz&quot; is &quot;ramming protection&quot;.  What's
interesting to me is that M 175 is supposed to be for panels (Kastenwagen),
standard (Neunsitzer), Kombi, &quot;Samba&quot; (Neunsitzer-Sondermodell), and
ambulance, while M 176 is supposed to apply only to single-cabs.

Another tidbit...forty-one years ago Friday (5 Jan 1960), from 554 147,
all Buses were supposed to get rear bumpers standard.  If your Buses
straddle this line, that might have something to do with the codes...
by default, a Bus built before then might not get bumpers, so over-riders
are called out on his Bus (implying bumpers too).  If yours is after
that date, bumpers would have been standard, so no code.  If they don't
straddle this line then all this goes out the window.  :)

Yeah, this is all from the Doliwa book.  I like it and I haven't yet
seen the thousands of Buses that y'all have so I read it from a book. :)
