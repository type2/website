Subject: important clutch question

Sachs clutch with 3000 miles on it:

My clutch is making a whirring, light scraping noise
when I push in the clutch pedal. It gets worse as I
push the pedal to the ground. This happens even when
the car is in neutral and not moving. Otherwise,
clutch operation seems fine (no jerking nor slipping).

This noise started after removing the engine for
tranny service.
One thing it might be is the throwout bearing.
When I took the engine out, I noticed the plastic disc
on the surface of the T/O bearing was half-missing.
Figuring I needed a flat surface to engage the clutch
plate, I peeled off the remaining half of the plastic
disc.

I think this missing surface disc might now be making
the T/O bearing slip or rub improperly on the pressure
plate.

Think so?

I just took the engine out and there are no signs of
wear or anything missing in the disk or plate. The T/O
bearing arm looks straight. Clips were in. There looks
like a lot of scratches and wear on the T/O bearing
surface and the corresponding surface of the pressure
plate. The metal is worn to copper (under plating) in
areas.

What do you guys think? Should I get a new TO with the
plastic disc intact?
