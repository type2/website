Soak the screws in WD40 to help loosen them up.  This would include tapping 
the screw with a screw driver and hammer, as in a &quot;gentle rapping at my 
chamber door&quot;, and adding more wd40 and tapping... on and on being very 
patient.  You do not want to strip out the heads and go through the 
resulting work.  I recall someone cited it taking a number of days to 
finally work the screws loose... was that Clara?
