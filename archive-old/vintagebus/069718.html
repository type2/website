Subject: RE: [VB] Internal Radio Antenna?

I tried this on my PV544, reception stunk. I'd like to know if anyone
succesfully did this without a window wire model.
Do you have a rear defogger? I think that could be made into one?

Hey ppl.  When I had my bus redone, I decided to not reinstall the old
antenna and had the holes filled.  Now I want to have a hidden modern radio
and don't want to reinvent the wheel.  I've got the radio figured out, but
am just looking around for a decent antenna to mount under the dash or in
the back somewhere, maybe even inside the door?
