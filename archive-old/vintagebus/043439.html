&gt;So I know Bob Hoover did a study on propane and decided it wasn't feasible
&gt;but I must admit with rising gas prices and my workmate friend John's nice
&gt;clean oil dipstick after 3 years and 90,000 miles on his Ford V8, I've
&gt;thought about it.  

Read everything at http://www.wps_dot_com/LPG/index.html for lots of good
info (this link is also available from the Library at type2_dot_com).
Basically it's a lot of technical notes on an LPG conversion on an
older (non-VW) station wagon.  One interesting note is that there is
a loop from the engine cooling system to heat the regulator so it
doesn't freeze; this will have to be done differently on an air-cooled
VW engine.
