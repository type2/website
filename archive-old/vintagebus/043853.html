&gt; uh, i think there are four bearings because there are four places that need

&gt; is why they changed to larger axles/brakes/lower-outer bearing, yeah that's
&gt; why they changed.  they do help support the load, gearing really doesn't

John,

Well, that is what I said. Maybe I should have said due to the *way* they
lowered the gearing, but since I went on to discuss the interaction of the
two reduction gears, I figured it was obvious.

&gt; &gt; per side were a necessity due to lowering the gearing.  Once you have 2
&gt; &gt; gears there, they have to be supported both ends to mesh properly unless
&gt; &gt; the shafts are fixed and stiff, which they are not in this case.

 I made this same point in the archives years ago, and no-one could give
me a definitive answer. I drew all kinds of ascii art, and explained
leverage.

Unless the force is centered between the bearings, the bearings will
actually see more force due to leverage and torsion as compared to a long
axle where leverage is not such a factor. If you look at a bus lower stub
axle it is much longer away from the outer lower bearing than it is
between the bearings.  Did you ever wonder why the lower outer bearing
always fails first? If VW had designed it so they shared the load  
perfectly wouldnt you see an even distribution of failures between the two
lower bearings? 

If you can tell me *exactly* why with even forces the lower outer bearing
almost always fails before the lower inner bearing, then I will believe
that you truly have a psychic connection into the minds of the VW
engineers and do know exactly what they intended.

Otherwise, I'll stick with logic and figure the forces must be uneven for
such a lopsided failure mode to occcur.

take care,

Steve
