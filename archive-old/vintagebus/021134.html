Subject: Re: [VB] undercover cops at jerome

I have no comment other than to encourage everyone to
have a wonderful time at Jerome this weekend and to
support the great charitable causes as previously
decided upon by the board and membership of the
Arizona Bus Club. The focus is too often on the
misbehavior of a few rather than on the true rationale
for holding the event in the first place. To clarify
that rationale from my experience is to:
A.&gt; Enjoy the company of the club membership and
GUESTS B.&gt; Raise funds thereby celebrating our
collective blessings with those less fortunate.

A (very) proud side product happens to be a nicely
redone splitty bus used as an instrument to raise
these funds. It is not in my **personal** opinion the
reason for holding Jerome.
Hooray and God's best to those who have busted butt,
many repeated years in a row to make it all happen.
Poop on the few douche bagger fools who have ruined it
or attempted to ruin it all for others in various ways
over the years.

I hope that all attendees have fun, conduct themselves
in a kind way and respect the courtesy that Arizona
Bus Club extends to all GUESTS. Act like you are in
some one else's home &lt;Don's&gt; or camping right next to
it. Try for once to GIVE instead of taking from the
event.

Good luck and have fun! =)
