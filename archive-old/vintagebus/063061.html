Subject: RE: [VB] axle boot/window seals parts review

&gt; I got some windshield seals from Bus Depot.  Dunno what
&gt; brand, it didn't say.  They were very supple, and fit very well,
&gt; and I like the way the outside of the seal lipped over the metal
&gt; of the bus, laying down flat.  I liked them better than the WW seals;
&gt; the outer lip of the seal does not flip down over the metal
&gt; of the bus as well as the no name brand from Bus Depot.


Thanks for the positive review.  Although we do not brand them, our
windshield seals are European made and imported directly by the Bus Depot,
so they are indeed different from what you will get from other suppliers.
Incidentally, our stationary side window seals and 64-up rear hatch window
seals come from the same factory and are of equal quality.
