&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I no longer have the time or facilities to maintain my Westy so I am
&gt; &gt; putting her up for sale. Here are the particulars.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1967 Westfalia
&gt; &gt; Good running condition, was a daily driver before I became a devout user
&gt; &gt; of public transit. Not 100% stock although most of the stock items are
&gt; &gt; there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 12 volt electrics and dual circuit brakes, first year for these to be
&gt; &gt; stock items.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some rust in the usual places, floor pan, wheel wells etc. Not bad yet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Over all she is a nice Westy that would make a fun driver or a good
start
&gt; &gt; for a restoration. I am interested in having her bought by someone
&gt; &gt; planning on keeping her on the road and not as a parts car.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have pictures I can email. She is located in Alameda, CA which is in
&gt; &gt; the San Francisco east bay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $2000 OBO
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't seem to be getting much interest so I am probably going to have
&gt; &gt; to donate her to charity and take the tax deduction if I can't find a
&gt; &gt; buyer.
