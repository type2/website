Subject: RE: [VB] Boycott Exxon

I always thought that oil spill argument was a hoot. Good for a chuckle
anyway. Don't get me wrong, we shouldn't be messing up the environment
on purpose, but accidents happen. Most of you forget how much natural
crude bubbles up from the ocean floor annually all over the world and
the infitesimal amount spilled by mere humans is meaningless. Good ol'
mother earth cleans itself up pretty well with out our efforts. Look at
the Valdez spill. The so called &quot;experts&quot; said it would be a death lands
for marine life for 50 years. Three years after the spill 95% of the
ecology was back and today you couldn't point it out if you went there.

If wee boycott any oil companies it should be for a good cause, like
obnoxiously high prices. IMHO
