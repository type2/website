Subject: how to prevent engine fires (again)


Just getting back to the list after several weeks away - another bus
engine fire - OKAY, everyone:

I've been posting this for years now, it's simple, and I see that others
are beginning to post and do it, so I'll post once again! ;-)

In order to prevent engine fires due to the most common reason for them -
front engine tin cuts thru metal fuel line:

Get four inches of the neoprene/webbed VW flexible black gas line (you
can buy this at any decent VW parts outlet), and split it lengthwise end
-to-end and slip it over your metal gas line, then push it down thru the
hole where it comes thru the front piece of tin, so that it protects the
metal line from rubbing on the edge of the tin's hole and cutting thru to
cause a gas leak and fire.

If you have an existing gasket there, remove it - they are unreliable and
fail always. The gas line fix will last indefinitely.

Be sure the metal line isn't already grooved/cut - replace if necessary,
then protect with the length of rubber gas line as above.

While you're at it, replace all your existing rubber gas line segments
with the VW gas line too, and use the small adjustable stainless steel
hose clamps at each end everywhere. Replace your gas line every year,
regardless. The VW webbed gas line is cheap, and it takes fifteen minutes,
and it gives you the opportunity to check all your critical gas
connections.

Do this as soon as possible, like next weekend, or tomorrow! Your bus
could be the next one to burn, and the solution is cheap and easy and
fast.

Okay, back to the list...
