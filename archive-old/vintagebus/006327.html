I went through a few listings on eBarf the other day and noticed a couple of
&quot;rare&quot; items that to me, were priced way to high. I won't point to any
specific ones here but heck, these prices keep going up every day. There are
others though. I got a used 6V starter for free, just paid shipping and some
people offered me the oil cooler mounts for free as well. I could get these
things you know and turn around selling on eBarf for money. I could......

never mind.

&gt; Jokes CAN be funny...  but the whole &quot;buying/selling&quot; scene has been
&gt; f*cking hilarious the last few years.  Enjoy things while you can,
&gt; things are going to get worse before they get better.
