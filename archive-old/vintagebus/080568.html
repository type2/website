Thanks for putting on a great campout Mark!

It was a great weekend for a campout after the rain died down about lunch 
time on Saturday.  Caught up with some old friends and met some new faces... 
  New faces to me since I am not familiar with most of the Virginia bus 
people (yet).

A great campground that is VERY kid friendly.  Bring the kids to this one 
next year people :)

Some very nice restored splitties were there as well.  And Mark's beautiful 
all original '66 hardtop Westi (drool).

* Note I came in the '93 Eurovan and slept on the cargo floor, not nearly as 
nice my '66 Westi.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
