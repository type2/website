&gt; I recently bought a jan 55 barndoor panel, vin #20-114468. Been sittin
since
 the 60's and the PO put newspapers soaked in oil covering the cargo area
 which kept it in near perfect condition. Will be bringing it down in a
few
 months when my new house is finished (place to put it). I also picked up
 a barndoor &quot;behr&quot; roof scoop for it (complete assembly).The &quot;problem&quot; is,
 I have my sights set to install the scoop, but I started gettin nailed
by
 barndoor and vintage bus owners, saying I needed to be sent to a mental
 institution for cutting the &quot;trademark&quot; barndoor peak.This barn has 60k
 original miles, but needs a dogleg, a rocker and a few other pieces
 replaced, so its not like it will be 100% uncut. So there is a dillema...cut
 the roof for a rare original barndoor only accesory? or leave it &quot;original&quot;?
 I refuse to even drill holes on an uncut VW, but since I will be replacing
 metal anyway, whats the difference? I can save the piece and weld it back
 in
 later if i so desire...One unnamed person commented I should take pictures
 of the bd peak sacrifice as it will be &quot;neat to look at me cutting up a
 60k
 og bd panel in a few years down the road&quot;....( I think you catch his drift
 =)...
 Looking for vintage nazi list opinions?
