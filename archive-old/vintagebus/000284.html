Subject: [VB] Water Injection - Spearco made it
Message-ID: &lt;0.633fd455.25780bfd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

In have one here, made by Spearco, I think the main thing was to stop pinging 
and you could add a little extra advance........
But it was made for water cooled cars, so I am not sure if the same thing 
would happen on aircooled.......
