Hi Pete,
Forgot to mention that we do have an interior mirror in our 1960 panel 
camper.  With the back seat up you can not see out the back.  The same is 
true of our 1963 SC with the tilt on the back.  We find in either that the 
interior mirror does help if you turn it until the driver can see out the 
rear part of the passenger side window.  This helps remove about 50% of the 
blindspot on the passenger side for the driver.  The problem with this center 
of the bus setup is if your passenger leans forward at all, you are blinded 
from looking into your blindspot.  A better way to accomplish the view would 
be by either installing a fish eye mirror just on the passenger side of the 
interior vent hung on a magnet (Computer hard drive magnets are great for 
this, and have lots of magnetism!) just above the passenger windshield and 
still be able to have and operatational passenger visor or installing a fish 
eye mirror on the passenger exterior mirror arm.  Either placement of a fish 
eye mirror would virtually eleminate the blindspot on the passenger side of 
the bus for the driver and not get blocked by the passenger as easily.  We 
have found some nice round fish eye mirrors by Barjon at truck stops that 
could be adapted fairly easily that are just a bit bigger than the stock 
round ones or install cracked stock round mirror to use one of those stick on 
fish eye mirrors from your FLAPS.
