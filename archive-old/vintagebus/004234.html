&gt; What about the thousands of OG buses that went to Japan with the Japanese

Actually, judging by the emails I have received from Japan on the doc
project, at least a fair number of them want to keep their buses original.
I guess they may have driven the prices up for buses in &quot;pristine&quot;
condition, and have snatched up some rarities...but I think they have a
right to be in the hobby.  The buses are being taken care of (ever hear of
their inspections?).  It doesn't seem fair to assume that bus ownership
should be limited to a select group of people, does it?

Last I checked, good projects could still be found for less than a grand or
so here in the states, and I bought a beautiful Westy :-)
