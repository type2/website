Thanks to all of you who wrote providing me with sympathy and like wise
stories after I got notice of three code violations from my city as a
result of a neighbors complaint.  So far the story has a happy ending.

I started by tearing down the brand new fence that I put up not more
than two months ago.  I pushed the NSU out from along side the double
cab and along the side walk to the front of the house, across the grass
in the front and up to the side of the house and behind the fence.  The
hardest part was getting it through the sand pit that I had built for my
daughter to practice her volleyball jumping.  Luckily only two wheels
had to go through the sand.  Back up went the fence.

I then cleaned up the leaves that had accumulated around the NSU and
double cab and got out a little concrete cleaner for the couple of small
patches of oil that had leaked (oil leaking out of a VW, imagine that!)
washed down the driveway and was done.

I tried calling the city inspector the day after receiving the notice,
but the city was closed on alternate fridays.  So I reached her on
Monday and had a nice talk.

I told her what I had done, that I had a whole bunch of parts (rubber,
tranny, engine stuff) on order and none of it had arrived yet.

Here is the point where bus karma comes in!  She had a friend who had a
'69 bus and is trying to restore it to 100% original and had just been
lamenting to her how hard it was to find the original carburator.  She
said she completely understood my predicament and ask when I thought I
might have it running again.

I told her if all the parts come in, I'd like to have it running by the
end of June.  She had no problem with that and said she'd drop by around
then and see how things were going.

Now here is the second bus karma point, how many of you have &quot;legal
justification&quot; to show to your wife/husband as the need to get out there
and get that bus on the road again.
