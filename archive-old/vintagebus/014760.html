Subject: Heat exchangers - bus? Bug?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA03843

I can't for the life of me figure out what is supposed to be different between
a bus heat exchanger and a bug one (fresh air)!  I'm at a bone yard with my
old one and I see that he has a bunch of used ones - but they all look the
same!  Mine was never hooked up so I don't know if it was right for the bus..

If they are different, will a bug one work?  Why are they different? *I'm sooo
confused*

Any help would be appreciated!
