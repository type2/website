Subject: Primer (was:re: lowering the type 2)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Those advocating the use of primer as a &quot;finish&quot; on
their bus or other vehicle should remember what primer
is--a coating designed to bond to the metal of the
vehicle, and also designed to have the finish coat
bond to it.  Primer is not made to stand up to
sunlight or weather, although it may offer some short
term protection in warmer climate.  I wouldn't let
primered VW metal out of the garage for more than a
few hours, myself, here in hot/humid/frigid/damp
Wisconsin.

And, about the age limit for lowered buses--are we
talking physical or mental age??&lt;G&gt;

Jim (in Wis)
65 double cab 
75 bus
Both as tall as designed, and almost completely
covered with proper finish paint.
