Subject: RE: [VB] battery explosion cleanup

Sulfuric acid spills are nasty business. The acid gets into the pores of
everything it touches and even though it looks good and scrubbed up, the
acid is still there. There used to be a good high alkaline content
garage floor cleaner that will balance the acid and help draw it off the
corrupted surfaces. I have had to scrub it in really good and let it sit
overnight and then rinse and scrub off in the morning. The trick is to
keep it on long enough to neutralize the acid.

As you may remember, I posted an earlier message about
my battery exploding.  I've since replaced the
battery.  Now I am facing the problem of cleaning up
the mess.  Right after it exploded I squirted the area
with water and mild soap I use to clean the windows.
Later when I got it home I hosed it down again with
water.  The next couple days I noticed a white and
brown corrosion building up in places.    Does anyone
have experience with this kind of contamination?  It's
left the engine and compartment with splatter like
corrosion deposits. Thanks for the help.
