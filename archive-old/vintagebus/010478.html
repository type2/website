Subject: Time is on my side.

In the past, I've posted to all of you about my old SOB neighbor that would
always phone me in for having &quot;junk&quot; in the yard, a VW parked in the street,
etc. and it would always attract the cops to come skulking around the place
making it look like they were looking for drug activitiy and so forth.

His name was George &quot;Bill&quot; Heikes.

And I say &quot;was&quot; because that old coot kicked the tin bucket today.  Over the
past 6 months he'd been falling down a lot and having the ambulance come and
pick him up because his frail wife couldn't do anything for him.  I found
out a month ago they took him to the nursing home.  Ever since he turned
&quot;sick&quot;, I haven't had one instance with the cops - pretty obvious who was to
blame for all the phone calls.

I spoke with my mom tonight and she said, &quot;Somebody died today,&quot; but this
time she said it with a smirk.  I must admit I smiled when I said Bill's
name.  Maybe this will shed a new light on my personality and shock a bunch
of people that I would even be like this but after the police visits, the
rude phone calls, and the daily spying - it's a HUGE burden off my back.  I
even have a new and very wealthy neighbor that moved in across the street.
We're watching his house for him while he's gone so it's nice to have traded
in old Bill for this better Bill.

Like I've said before - time is on my side and I personally vow that I will
NEVER become like this when I'm an old man.

I had no use for Bill because of the spiteful things he said to me over the
phone.  If I posted to this list what I really thought of him, I would no
doubt get kicked off the list.

So now we can have our VW freedoms once again - that is until someone else
moves into the neighborhood and decides they &quot;own&quot; it.

Thank you father time.
