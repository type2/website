Hi Volks,
Exactly!  Since most ACVW owners not running any temp gauge it is easy to run 
the engine temp way over 230F during warm/hot weather.  Which will quickly 
break down oils.  Flash point can vary from 352 to 460F.  The problem with 
using taxi test info is more than likely the taxies used in the test were 
water cooled.  Which according to info we have found, water cooling is 25 
times more efficient than trying to transfer the engine heat from oil to the 
outside air.  Also one of the advantages of the water cooled engine is if you 
over heat it the radiator blows steam to tell you that you have overheated 
the engine!  In the ACVW engines those who do not have gauges just keep going 
oblivious to thier engine oil temp or worse yet, floor it and ignore it.
   Also some of the cheaper oils like Penzoil dino stuff that use a paraffin 
base the oil passages in the engine case become thiner due to paraffin 
coating thicker and thicker.  This paraffin coating not only causes less oil 
pressure to the bearings, but also will probably insulate the oil from the 
inner surfaces of the oil cooler and other inner engine surfaces!   
  From what we understand the oil manufacture will supply data about the 
specific product you are interested in if you write to them.  
   Here below is one web page on oil info we have been able to find and we 
would appreciate to hear of any others!
