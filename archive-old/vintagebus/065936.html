Subject: RE: [VB] oil temp sender mounting

On a lot of the cases that area is flat and thin walled. I have had it
drilled and tapped for a 14mm spark plug thread insert, (note: not a
helicoil, a steel insert with a shoulder), that fits the thread of many
foreign thermostatic switches. One of my shelf motors had this installed and
I had to end up using an AC/Delco short spark plug with doped up threads as
a plug until I could get another plug!

I don't know what type of case you are running but if you happen to have a
universal case with the block off plate for a type 3 dipstick you can drill
the plate and weld in half a pipe union and install the sender there. Also
good for a thermostatic switch for an oil cooler electric fan. Just
something to ponder.
