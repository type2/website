Subject: Re: [VB] Re: 1965 Door Handles

Eric,

I don't think new handles are available anywhere unless you could find
someone with a NOS set ($$$$$$$$$). You could look for used ones and then
take them with the ignition to a locksmith and he could probably make a
master for all three.

    Does anyone know where I can find a pair of 65 front door handles
with keys? I have a bus without any keys except the ignition and I want
to re-key the bus to the new door handles.
