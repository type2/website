It's funny, on the old Ford truck list I'm on, people
think nothing of changing things radically and
NOBODY has ever shown the least concern for history.
I have a historic truck, and stand out from that
crowd in that I have no intention of ever changing
my truck to something it never was.  I don't need
a bigger engine, don't need power steering, don't
need it to go faster, etc.

Interesting in that the trucks in question are 
the same vintage as the VW busses we discuss.
It's just that zillions more Ford Trucks were made,
thus not as rare and people don't recognize the
history being lost as they get crushed.

My truck is on par with a Binz crewcab in history,
a pre-production coach built crewcab, very rare.

I recognize the intrinsic value, including the historic
value and as a working truck.  I feel the same with busses.
I'm very glad to read that others feel the same.

Jeff
'64 F100 Ford CrewCab
'67 Deluxe Hardtop that has a new identity, different
from it's original intention, custom colors in &amp; out.
So try and flame me for being a hypochrite concerning 
my bus, but I bought it that way.  I could never have 
done it myself.

&gt; Todd,
&gt;    If you are really wanting to put a sunroof in your bus, why not 
&gt; get one
&gt; from Street Beat. So everyone will know that it is not original. 
&gt; When you
&gt; change stuff like this, you are changing history.
