People ! ?

It must be the summer heat.  Everyone seems to be so testy these days.  Can't we just all get along?  Look, I'm not saying we all shouldn't voice our opinions.  Afterall, I think that is one purpose of the list.  But let's be cool about it.  The spinal cord of the list, I think, is to keep our buses on the road and to share info on how to keep that happenin'.

Granted, sometimes individuals might not candy coat their opinions or advice.  But try not to let it get under your skin.  Easy for me to say right now, after getting bombarded for mentioning grafting a skylighted roof onto my non-sunroof bus.  I'm not saying Rick or Michele or anyone else doesn't have a right to get pissed off at someone, but it always seems that cooler heads should prevail.  With that said.........

&quot;Please don't dominate the rap Jack, if you've got nothing new to say.&quot;
