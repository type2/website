Hi Diana,
If the return springs on the clutch arm on the tranny and the clutch pedal 
are not broken then most likely the axle shaft of the clutch pedal itself has 
gotten dirt/rust gundging it up.  Have done this twice on our 63SC and next 
time we will be drilling and tapping the clutch pedal axle bore with a grease 
fitting like the stock one on our 1960 panel.  Once you make sure that your 
return springs are not broken then have a friend push the clutch pedal down 
and with two pieces of fairly thin wood inside of the jaws of a vise-grips 
clamp the pieces of wood in front of one of the sheet metal walls the clutch 
cable goes through before heading through the clutch tube.  This will clamp 
the cable still and allow you to remove the front end of the clutch cable 
from the clutch pedal and allow reattachment after repairs without having to 
unadjust the clutch cable.  Then take apart the clutch pedal, clean, grease 
it all up.  Make sure the plate that the forward clutch cable pin goes 
through is not ovalized (Get it welded and redrill it if it is!), and 
reassemble!
