I can go along with that.  The net effect is pretty much the same,
though.

Probably.  I always let the pump's auto-shutoff decide where &quot;full&quot;
is.  I also don't put the nozzle in all the way, mainly because then
the auto-shutoff triggers immediately, no matter how much is in the
tank.  The result is a pretty consistent level (and corresponding
mileage calculations), which I can see after removing the nozzle.
Looks like where I'd expect &quot;full&quot; to be.  And it definitely produces
puddles if then parked leaning to the right after doing so.
