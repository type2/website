Are you sure the bolts go in from the front (FIF)? Mine go in from the rear
and have a flat spot cut into the head to keep 'em from spinning. I slip
them in, crawl underneath, and put the nuts on. Well, it's not that simple,
but that's the procedure. It helps to have a friend to reach behind the fan
shroud and hold the bolts in there (so they don't pop back when you go to
put the nut on). That's for mine though, and there are other set-ups. I once
had an engine (in a bug, maybe?) with threaded inserts, so there was no need
for nuts. Really nice.

&gt; I was surprised again yesterday by how hard it is to get the nuts on the
&gt; upper engine bolts in a Type 2.  In fact, I'm still at it this
&gt; morning.  I
&gt; think if I can jam a socket and extension in front of the
&gt; driver's side bolt,
&gt; I may be able to wiggle the nut down past the doghouse shroud and get the
&gt; damned thing started.  I'm still not sure what I'll do to secure the
&gt; right-side bolt.  Anyone have any real good ideas on this subject?
