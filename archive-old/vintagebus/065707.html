Subject: Re: [VB] NEATO (not for the faint at heart if you are a NEATO
  lover)

&gt;Can someone tell me HOW TO GET AHOLD OF SOMEBODY AT NEATO!!

I also got tired of the backstabbing and trying to get people to do
the right thing and resigned from being editor last April.

The new editor is John Foley and you can reach him at barndoor_at_etcrier_dot_net.

George Bossarte is supposed to handle all membership inquiries and you
can reach him at gbeng_at_world.std_dot_com.

Good luck,
