I had a '61 &quot;flip seat&quot; with the 4 brackets, I never could figure that out. When
I sold it the NO (new owner) asked me and I just looked at him and said &quot; I have
no clue&quot; needless to say I felt *really* smart right then.................

I'd like to know for future use. I have another set of 4 brackets and I want to
put the correct ones on my DD Panel so I can have my Westy tent off one side and
my Sundial &quot;shade tent&quot; off the other. Perfect for Bug O
Rama.....................
