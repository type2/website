For everyone who isn't going to that &quot;other&quot; show this weekend, I want to
spread the word about our annual show in Springfield, Missouri.  It's
happening this weekend - June 9th.
There are 35 classes, and each class has 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place trophies.
Plus there are several special awards given.  There are lots of activities
to keep kids busy, and tons of great stuff to buy in the swap meet area.
There will be lots of give-aways, and contests.  In the past the show was
held down town on the square, but last year it was moved to beautiful and
nostalgic Chesterfield Village, where it will again be held this year.  This
has always been a great show, and this year we are expecting well over a
hundred Volkswagens and great weather.  There's a low show entry fee, and
you get a VW goodie bag and chances to win great prizes, but even if you
can't get your VW here, stop by - as always, admission is absolutely free.
There will also be a camping event held for show visitors by SAMBA, the
local NEATO chapter.
For more information visit the club website at www.groovenvws_dot_org, or please
don't hesitate to drop me a line.

Thanks,
