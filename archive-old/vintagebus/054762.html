Subject: Mystery dizzy

I bought a used dizzy at the OCTO meet. It was real cheap, so I am not
out much if it is useless. It is a VW/Audi dizzy, doesn't say Bosch.
It has a vacuum can on it, single connection, so I assume that is a
vacuum advance. It is a tall dizzy, not one of the shorter ones that I
think went on the pancake engines. The number 050 is above the logos,
but I thought the 050 was a straight mechanical advance. The rest of
the numbering reads:
JFU4
0 231 170 186
043 905 205K
Neither of these numbers appears on the oldvolkshome page. There is a
043 905 205D used in a 71 bus and 71-73 autostick bug, 043 905 205H
used on the 75-79 manual trans fuel injected bug, and a 043 905 205J
on the 75 Autostick FI bug. The Bosch numbers do not correspond. There
is Bosch dizzies  0231 170 034 for a 74 manual bug, 0231 170 036 for a
74 Autostick bug, and 0231 170 093 for a 74 automatic bus and the
air-cooled vanagon, but the VW numbers do not correspond. I'm
confused. It sure looks like the dizzy I want, though.
What do I have other than a somewhat oily but otherwise fine
paperweight? I am trying to replace the 009 on my bus, but I am
wondering if this is the right choice for my 1600dp someday-to-be
1600sp.
Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial

&gt;The dizzy is 043 905 205K.  The nearest I could find in the archive
&gt;dizzy page was 043 905 205D, for a '71 bus.

Try http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm - it lists an 043 905
205J
for a '75 Beetle Auto-stick, fuel-injection.  The original application
for your distributor is probably closer to that.  Is there a Bosch
number
(like 0 231 xxx yyy) on it?

&gt;Would this be a refinement of the same dizzy, or something different
&gt;altogether?

With most parts, as the letters at the end go up, the part gets
better.
With a distributor, though, it usually means an advance curve change -
not necessarily &quot;better&quot;, just &quot;different&quot;.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
