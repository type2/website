OK, I've checked the archives and sermons, read my Bentley and Haynes and
started in on this job, but need a little help.

Previously I asked about solutions to my broken redux box mounting bolts and
from those responses determined that I need grade 8 or better bolts.  The
12mm-1.5 bolt with a 19mm head had 10K on it and several other places (but
not the reduction box section) Bentley mentions use only 10K bolts.  When I
went around trying to find replacement bolts, the help I got ranged from the
clueless, &quot;I don't know what grade that bolt is&quot; to the more knowledgeable,
&quot;That's a hardened bolt, I know we don't have those.&quot;  Is grade 8 good here,
or do I need to get something more specialized?

Next, I tried to easy-out the broken bolts with the axle still in the bus
and ended up with a broken easy-out, so I have come to the conclusion that
the box must come out.  The best clue I got from my manuals was, &quot;use a
special puller that grips between the inner and outer races&quot; to remove the
lower, outer roller bearing before removing the box cover and use the same
or similar to remove the upper outer.  I used to have one of these special
pullers, but can no longer find it and it has been so many years that I
can't remember clearly how it worked (I only used it once).  So my next
question is where can I get one of these pullers?  Does Grainger have one
that works, or do I order it from Harbor Freight?

Finally, the responses I got and the archives indicate a couple different
approaches to my ovalled out hole.  One is to drill out for a 5/8 bolt, then
grind off the 5/8 bolt flush and drill and tap for a 12mm-1.5 bolt.  The
other is to drill out for either a 12mm or 1/2&quot; helicoil.  If the ovalling
isn't too bad, I think I'll go for the helicoil approach, but my first
problem is to get out the broken bolts.

My last resort is to replace the whole assembly if I can find one, and save
the repair for the future.  This approach is probably the most likely to get
my bus on the road soonest, so I am pursuing both approaches.  In either
case, I will need those hardened bolts and the special puller, so those
searches have the top priority.

Thanks for any help,
