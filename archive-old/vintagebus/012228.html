Well, James and I got the upper bearing inner race off with a hammer and screwdriver, but the lower race (on the wheel spindle) still won't come off. There is a large washer or flange behind the bearing and we are not sure if it is part of the bearing or not. If somebody doesn't give us an idea how to remove this pretty soon, we might just split the bearing inner race off with a hammer and cold chisel, but I hate to bang on it too much for fear that I may damage the bearing on the other side of the gear. I would greatly appreciate it if someone would post or e-mail me some advice...

thanks,
david
