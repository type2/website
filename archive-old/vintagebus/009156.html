Doug Lloyd from the VintagVW list has provided us all with a glimpse of the
gold mine that awaits us vdubbers at Zearing, IA.

I've taken the original 300K+ per-file-gifs and converted them into halfsize
.jpgs which are comparable to 35mm shots when viewed on screen.  The average
size per picture is 65K - all are selectable and have descriptions to read
BEFORE you select what photos you wish to see.  It's not a fancy page but it
let's you travel to Zearing for free...
