&gt; while you have it.

I'm with you Steve...Monday, Kids to Scout Meetings, Tuesday, Dog to Vet,
Wednesday, Day Care Center Meeting, Thursday, Club Meeting, Friday, Out to Dinner
with Family...Saturday Bus maintenance (after yard work, errands, groceries,
soccer games etc. etc.). Sunday (if I'm lucky) work on bus in the afternoon.
No wonder I'm installing muffler clamps at 6:45 a.m. in my office clothes, driving
the bus to work to spend my lunch hour doing this 'n that in the company parking
lot.
It's all worth it though...
