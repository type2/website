&gt; Hey, 
&gt; I have found the same thing, what good is a big mirror if it gives you a 
&gt; headache when you use it.  Mine wiggle like crazy.  So did most busses come 
&gt; with teh
&gt; small round mirrors stock with an available upgrade to the larger ones?  
&gt; What years did they come stock on?  etc.etc.etc.

Hi Gene,
From what we have gleaned from our literature the bus about 1958 came with 
only one exterior mirror on the driver side to the USA as a standard item.  
While in shipping the arm would be loosly bolted in place and swiveled near 
the body while the small round mirror head would be stored in a box in the 
interior with other stuff for each bus.
