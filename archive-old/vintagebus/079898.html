&gt; Stock clutch is like butter and 1700lb you know you are pushing.
&gt; Hope this helps

One problem with the stiff clutches is that the added pedal effort
increases stress on the entire system.

Unless you have a really powerful engine, it is unlikely that you will
slip a stock clutch, so stock is usually better.
