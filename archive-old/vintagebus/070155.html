Subject: Headlight parts

Can anyone help me, I am in need of the large wire that mounts inside of
the headlight bezel in my 67 and holds the light back and provides
counterpressure from the adjusting screws, my old one rusted through.  I
also need the clips that go between the bezel ring and the light
assembly (the outer set of clips) if anyone has these parts and could
part with them please let me know.  I can pay you very quickly.  Every
time I meet an oncoming vehicle I say sorry as my one light tends to
shine right in their eyes.
