&gt;  I just sold my single cab project to make room for a '63 23 window!
&gt;It was basically a trade as I sold the single cab for the same 
&gt;amount as the cost of the 23..the 23 is a driver too!but it only has 
&gt;windshields in place at this time.but I can drive it home!
&gt;
&gt;It came with all of the parts minus seals and a middle seat whitch I 
&gt;am now looking for.does anyone out there know of one for sale? I 
&gt;would prefer the short version.thanx
