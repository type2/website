Subject: Re: [VB] Re: VIN

&gt; I know someone who had a very cool personalised liscence plate on her bug.  
&gt; The bug got trashed, and she bought another and swapped plates to keep the 
&gt; cool plate.  i don't know if she still has it and if not if she swapped the 
&gt; correct plate back on the car when she sold it.   


personalized plates ARE swappable but you are supposed to go to dmv to do it :-)
my zapper plates have been switched to several buses and my cellair plate has been on 4 cars but
the title matched at the time and i still have my washington personal plates so if i ever make it
back i can put them back on zapper and not have to do it all over again!
