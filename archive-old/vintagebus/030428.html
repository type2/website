Sorry, I was asking about pulling the sender not whether it was the
sender that was bad or not, but hey, any experience is always nice. It
is a 65 bus. The previous owner converted the bus to 12 v but I don't
know if he changed the sender or the guage. I have used the guage for
almost a year. Up untill recently when I would fill up it used to go up
to inbetween full and 3/4 and when it said empty I could put in about 8
gallons. My wife is the only one who has ran it out of gas and she said
it happened right after the guage said  empty. Now I fill it up and it
says just under a half, and at empty I can only put in 2 1/2 to 3
gallons. I know it is a stock bus guage, but I don't know if the
previous owner changed it or not. I figured that it had developed a hole
in the float. The bus had sat for 14 years before I put the last 10,000
mile on it.It started happening on our way back from California. I am
getting 11.5 volt at the positive pole on the guage and about 30 ohms of
resistance between the poles of the guage. The spare guage I used was a
motorola 12v fuel guage. I know that it might read different than the
stock guage, but it reads exactly the same as the guage that I have in
there. Also I will climb in the engine compartment and check the ground
wire on the sender. I hadn't thought of that.
