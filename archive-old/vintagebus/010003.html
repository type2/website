Talk about making a guy feel REALLY old...

In a previous life I was living in Normal, and working at a big Shell
station/garage near Route 66 in neighboring Bloomington.  Somehow word got
out that the stranger from the West coast actually had experience with funny
little furrin cars.  At that time there was a grand total of 1 [one] VW in
town [a Beetle] and it came to me for maintenance and service 'cuz the
nearest dealer was in Chicago.  I also cared for a TR3, the only sports car
in town.

It was very entertaining to watch folks' reactions when they saw the VW up
on the hoist, with its &quot;broken axles&quot; dangling at odd angles.  Got even
better when the engine lid was open for engine service.  During one
particularly memorable discussion the accusation was put forth that VW had
stolen the air-cooled rear engine configuration from Tucker.

A few weeks before I left the area a local woman bought a Ghia convert.,
raising the county's VW population to 2 [two], and I tended it as well.

I left Normal in the summer of 1960, and there still wasn't [OBC...] a
single VW Transporter/Station Wagon/Bus in the county.....
