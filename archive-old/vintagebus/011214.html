Subject: little more progress (need some metal)

More progress on the 57:

Have made plans for blasting the underbelly.  I now have all the tools and 
media that I need.  Will probably take it down to the shop or put it in the 
barn (yes I live on a farm with cows and such) and blast away.  I plan to 
tape everything that could be &quot;injured&quot; by the blasting, ie. all the vents, 
hinges, little nooks and crannies that would just tend to hold the sand and 
all the moving parts.  This should be minimal with the front end completely 
removed as well as the rear.  Bought the dollies that bolt right up.  It was 
a rather good investment.

Next stop will be installing new floor sections in the cargo area and 
patching the front floors.  Have heard that some of the repros are pretty 
nice but I do opt for original pieces.  Here is what I need.  

outer 10&quot; of cargo floor (both pass and driver)
pass and driver rockers (inside rocker is toast)
seat mount anchors for both pass and drivers sides

Also i noticed that the passenger side jackpoints both need to be replaced 
with the rear one desperately needing the rail it connects to.  Can't 
remember the exact technical term but I think you all understand.  

Still looking for a pressed rear bumper, splash pans and front and rear 
moulding!
