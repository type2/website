Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Rear axle stub diameter and pitch

I bought a thread gauge and found that it is indeed M30 x 1.5. And as usual,
it a very non-standard diameter/thread combination for rethread dies.

&gt;Does anyone know the diameter of a big stub rear axle and the thread pitch?

Page H-4 7 of your '63-'67 Bentley has the diameter (M30), but not the
pitch.  A little Googling around says that the standard M30 pitch is
3.5 mm and the fine M30 pitch is 2 mm or 1.5 mm, but the pitch on the
axle isn't guaranteed to be any of these.
