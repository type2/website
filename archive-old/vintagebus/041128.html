 Al,
    When I was at Wolfsburg West in February they had sandblasted and primed
 popout frames for sale.They also had powdercoated frames for sale,though I
 cleaned
 there stockout then, they may have restored some more.I believe I paid $60
 each for the powder coated frames.Not cheap,but I have restored some myself
 and know what a pita they can be when working with really rusty frames.
 good luck,


                  woody
         &quot;keep on pushin'''

 89 westy
 64 kombi   slow (big nut)
 61 panel    slower (small nut)
 60 westy    slowest (no nut)
 57 oval  (for sale)

  Also, pop outs. Mine are moderately pitted, swayed away from ISP repos due
 to recent threads, so I am searching for either more restorable OEs ,
 NOSes, or reassurance that filler is ok here by tested experience
