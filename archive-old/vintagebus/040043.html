hey now,
i dont know if someone else has found these, but i came across them on 
another forum and was pretty psyched. every time i get in the bus i freak 
about someone rear-ending me while turning left. im sure they would fit too, 
there is a lot of room in those bulb holders. im gonna order tomorrow, ill 
let you all know the results. they are 12V.
