&gt; Hi folks -
&gt;  I have a question for y'all
&gt;  I recently did a brake adjustment for the first time on my '67 Deluxe.
&gt;  Since my Vw shop manual was missing, I chose to follow good ol' John M's
&gt;  directions.
=  == = = 
good idea!!
&gt;  Everything was progressing as explained (which is pretty hard considering
&gt;  that &quot;closest part of the tire&quot; bit - why not just say up/down?)
=  == 
because he was writing for bugs and buses, and things are oriented 
differently on different models, 
&gt;  Anyway, I started at the passenger rear and worked my way around -
&gt;  everything was working just like he said... until I got to the passenger
&gt;  front which was the exact opposite of what it should have been.
&gt;  
= = = = 
cause right and left are mirror images of each other, don't worry about it 
your bus is fine.
&gt;  
&gt;  Another question -
&gt;  I noticed that as the star turned (in the non-functioning, seemingly
&gt;  upside-down passenger -side brakes) there was a significant hollow &quot;clack&quot;
&gt;  noise as the star turned - all of the spindles were replaced (according to
&gt;  p.o. repair invoices - which called them cylinders) during a complete brake
= = == 
they probably did replace the cylinders- there are two on each front brake 
assembly.  The spindle is in the steering section= it has that bit that pokes 
out through the drum, that the front drum bolts onto.

&gt;  system overhaul in '95. All the other stars were greasy and made no
&gt;  'clacking' as I turned them... is it significant that the one that isn't
&gt;  working is bone dry?
=  == 
how is the star not working?  the clack is probably the detente spring 
clacking against the star, and this is normal.  Are you sure you are turning 
the star the correct way?- it can be tricky to visualise.  If you turn the 
star one way it pushes the brake shoe against the drum and then you can't 
turn the wheel (or the star).  If You can't turn the star any more, and the 
wheel still spins, you are probably turning the star the wrong way, so try it 
the other way.  If the same thing happens that way, no more turning and the 
wheel still spins, I'd look under the drum.   OK, the wheel doesn't 
turn...Back the star adjustment off till the shoe just barely rubs (you can 
hear it as you spin the wheel by hand)
Now go in the bus and stomp a few times *hard* on the brake pedal, and 
recheck the adjustment.

Did the brake Hoses get replaced during the brake overhaul 5 years ago?  If 
not, do yourself a favor and replace them all 4.  They are not mentioned in 
the Idiot book, so I learned they were supposed to be replaced after one 
failed on my bus and I had no brake pedal.
