Subject: parts apb

That battery hold down thread prompted me to post the following list of
a few items I'm (still) in need for the double cab:

- lower 4 inches or so of both rear pillars. (see pic on my site)
- red tip to a hirschmann antenna
- starter solenoid power strap paper 
- 2 Fictel &amp; Sachs shocks.  Preferably with a 4-59 date code but I'll
bend a little if they are close.  All I want are some good bodies as
I'll rebuild them.
- correct vent frame to vent latch rivets.  MSC has these but I need to
order a 1000 at a time!


Any leads are most welcome!

Thanks
David
