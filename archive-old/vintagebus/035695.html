&lt;&lt; I would appreciate some help on a problem that has me stumped.  I have 
been working w/ limited success for a long time to solve an overheating 
problem in my 1970 Westfalia w/ a 1600 dual port motor.  By overheating I 
mean that the Gene Berg dipstick sensor causes the oil pressure idiot light 
to flash at 60 mph on an interestate w/ small, rolling hills on a warm day 
(70 degrees or more ambient temp)-i.e. 225 deg. F.  My CHT gauge runs around 
300 deg. F.  I have looked at a very wide variety of potential causes which I 
will not detail here, but one problem that I can't figure out is how to fix

Well, a loose fan belt will surely help your motor run hot.


there are at least 5 stock sizes of crank pulley that I have seen. What I 
tend to do is grab the largest I can for my motor.  do measure the diameter 
and see what difference you find.  ?  sizes on gen pulley too?  I am not 
sure.  at least you switched to a smaller belt, which should definately help. 
 Do you have any idea what CR the motor was buildt with?  Do you have good 
engine comp seal, good engine to body seal, air gaps in tin?
