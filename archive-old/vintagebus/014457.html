&lt;&lt; Got the back
 rests and passenger seat out easily, but can't figure out the trick of
 the driver's seat.  Can someone please tell me how?  I looked all around
 and under the seat, practically stood on my head trying to figure out
 how to remove it myself &gt;&gt;

  I am not following the back rests out deal(?), are they stock seats?
Anyways, there is a lever on the bottom right in the front, of the front seat.
Twist it up, and pound the back of the seat with your hand or whatever, they
sometimes get clogged up with camel hair!
