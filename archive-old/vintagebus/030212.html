Subject: RE:Shocks Ahoy!

Was Written
&gt;Seriously though, I've expericenced this before. The front end on this
&gt;Barndoor bounces up and down like crazy when going over medium to large
&gt;dips but handles most small bumps fine. Now I'm thinking that the shocks
&gt;are gone and the torsion bars aren't able to stop from working as soon
&gt;as they should. What are the thoughts from you guys?

I had a front end problem on my 65 Westy that was a real puzzler. The
ride was terrible even after installing new shocks. I lubed the front
end until clean grease came out of every joint. Still it rode like a
lumber truck. It was better with all of the Westy stuff out than when it
was loaded. Everyone told me it should ride better with some weight in
it. WRONG. I finally could't take it any longer. I jacked the front end
up to see if there was some kind of catch in the movement of the front
end. There wasn't just a catch. In fact there was no movement up and
down. The roller bearings in the torsion are were rusted solid and the
cages were somewhat crushed from the banging. My front end suspension
was only the bounce in my tires. I should have suspected some like that
'cause it had not driven in 21 years prior to my buying it. Lots of hard
work and it is all happy now.
So I suggest you check for full movement of the suspension parts
