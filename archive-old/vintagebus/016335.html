Then try this:  run it for a while, until the reading is steady.  Turn
it off (or not, as you wish), and go hold your hand against the bottom
of the engine.  If it's really warm, then you have an engine
temperature problem.  If you hear a sizzling noise and have to use a
spatula to pull your hand off (with accompanying cursing), then the
gauge seriously needs to be recalibrated.

Assuming you have an upright engine (there's a whole bunch of tin in
an almost-crescent shape above the cylinders, in front of the
generator)....

The flaps are inside the crescent, just above the cylinders.  About
the only part you can see/feel with the engine in is the hinge tabs
sticking out the front of the tin (FIF), right where it wants to flare
out above the cylinders.

You could also have the older style of temperature control, which
instead of flaps uses a kind of a movable venturi in the fan opening.
Reach around to where the fan is (I'd recommend having the engine off
for this).  You should feel the fixed-in-place tin, and the fan.  Do
you also feel a round thing that's somewhat movable around the entire
opening, with some sort of bracket at the bottom?  If so, then you
have the venturi, not the flaps.

In any case, no matter what you've got, unless the ambient
temperature's below freezing, twenty minutes of warmup should get the
engine well above 120 degrees.  My money's on a bad gauge or sensor,
or possibly a bad/dirty connection in the wire between them.
