I'm pulling the 1641 on the truck and putting it on the tear down stand as
soon as the 1500 SP is assembled. I will miss it, for awhile. The DP gets
upgraded to a 1776 with an Engle 100 and a center mount Weber. Heck, it was so
nice on the trike that I think I'll put one in everything! Look out Volks Air,
daddy's got his drill out! heh heh

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

Oops, &quot;Fry&quot; day, my bad. (hahahahaha!)

Got the $200. 1980 Dasher Thrasher on the road with legal AZ State license
plates as of Monday. Personalized plate ordered is: APOSCAR
Meaning as given to AZ DMV is &quot;My positive contribution to the environment
(45mpg).&quot;

The thing smoked like a wet wood fire around a Rastafarian ganja camp while
going through emissions. I figured that there was no way that I would pass.
No
doubt the testing dude called to the supervisors' office. Big discussion and
delay... Problem? No way that I was passing.... NOPE! no bigs, the printer in
the testing bay failed to print out my COMPLIANCE statement. hahahah!

Hood held down with bungees.

BUS CONTENT&gt; had to run down to the DMV by my house (3rd trip to DMV in one
day) to prove insurance coverage on the 63 bus. Now I will be financially
forced to get that one on the road too! The funny thought of the day was that
I
remembered as a kid reading that Elvis had a car for every day (unhuh-
ahunka-
unhuh) of the week. At the time I thought it was outrageous. Now I just think
that he was lucky not to have eBay and VWPlanet in his living room. I have
seen
real bargains and real trash on the vw FS websites lately. I think that I
will
stay put at four vehicles for one and one half drivers for now. (un-huh!)
