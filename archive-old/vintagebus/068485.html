Subject: Re: [VB] a Phriday question

There are two complete kitchens in some Westy that I know of in Alvarado
Texas and Kennedale TX.
If you want I'll try to scrounge up the yard names and phones.
One is a 75 others are those with separate cabinets but same tanks I
suppose.
I have a good tank for an 80-83/ ??? Up Westy with the water level
seonsor for 90 us if you want it.
