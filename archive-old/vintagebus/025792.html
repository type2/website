&lt;&lt;I also need a single-port intake manifold, without a blocked heat
riser
tube, for this Bus. Does anyone out there have one for sale, or know
where I
could get one?&gt;&gt;

I had a singleport manifold that was clogged in the heat risers just the
other day, and I remembered someone on the list said to use a old clutch
cable and cut it so it was long enough to get to the center and install
the end with the threads in a drill.  Just like clearing a drain rotor
rooter style.  I gave it a try and it worked great.  I started buy
soaking it in solvent for a day then put it in a vise and started at it
with the drill and cable.  It took about a 1/2 hour to clear it
completely.  I would go in the direction of the cable and once I reached
the center I reversed the drill and pulled the cable back.  As it
unwound and myself pulling it out it expanded and really bit into it.  I
wish I would have thought of that a long time ago.  I can't begin to
tell you how many times I have searched for one that was able to blow
through clearly.
