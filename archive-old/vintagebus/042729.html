Jeez, thats a bummer.

A barndoor beam is hard enough to find, then if you would need a RHD
barndoor beam, ouch.

Is a barndoor beam like a 55-67 beam where the swing lever housing is
welded on? could you have it cut off and moved to the other side thus
makign yourself a RHD beam out of a good LHD beam...

Might be easier than sourcing a RHD beam, and easier than fixing yours if
its messed up bad enough. (i'd have a professional welder do that one,
heh.)

take care,

Steve
