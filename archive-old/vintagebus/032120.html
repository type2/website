&lt;&lt; The clutch peddle has the proper amount play, but the clutch seems to be 
not fully disengaging.  There is plenty of thread left on the cable to adjust 
more, but then there is no free play left at the pedal. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Definitely sounds like either a bad needle bearing in the FW gland bolt or a 
problem with your clutch disc and/or pressure plate.  Do not drive it much 
that way or risk damaging your syncros.  If you have to drive it do it 
without using the clutch pedal as much as safely possible.    Eric&amp;Barb
