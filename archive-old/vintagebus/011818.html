I can't seem to get this mail directly to the individual , so I'll have to
post it to the list.  Sorry for taking up list space.  DKPerdue
Kevin Murphy  (kmurphy_at_niu_dot_edu),
You answered my posting  for selling my '65 Deluxe, but everytime I try to
reply your server says your address is incorrect.  I get this  &quot; Addresses
of the form &quot;user&quot;_at_niu_dot_edu are aliases for the user's real 
email address. The ph (phonebook) nameserver has been unable to determine
the user's real email address for the following reason.  &quot;E-mail field not
present in nameserver entry,&quot; 
Your address show up in my mailbox as:  kmurphy_at_niu_dot_edu
So here is my answer to your request for more info on the bus.
This might answer your questions.


Here is some more scoop for you: 
My phone number is (757) 686-0479 if you want more info. 

- Is it a walkthrough? No, the cab has the partition where you store the
spare tire behind the seat. 
-Is the bus roadworthy? Good question. Since I got it without an engine,
and it had had 2 flats that had been flat for so long that the tires were
permanently busted. The guy I got it from brought it over to me on a
trailer. It took me 2 weeks to get the lugs off they had been on there so 
long. I sandblasted the rims, replaced the wheel cover clips , painted the
rims and put 4 new tires on it. I would think it would tow all right. 
13 windows. 

Interior? One bench seat that I don't think is VW. A Previous Owner, who
should rot in Hell, put two bucket seats of unknown origin in it up front.
(Not a &quot;walk-thru&quot; Spare goees behind the front seats. Needs side panels
and headliner. 
All the lights and glass there? YES, Front Passenger windshield needs to be
replaced.   All pop-outs on sides are there 
And finally how much rust? Probably should replace RT side rockers under
door, parts of front floor and cargo area. Underneath, it looks good.
Mainly exterior rust on bottoms of both sides and along front bottom. 
Needs Battery tray, but I got one from Das Bulli Haus for you (included) 
Also- a PO (he, who is to rot in hell!) trashed the dash to put in a $19.95
K-Mart Am/FM/Cassette radio and tons of Bondo. I got all the Bondo off and
got two (Yes, 2!!!) extra dashes for you to play with (included). 
12 to 6 volt relay added for wipers. 
Don't forget the 12 v refrigerator!!! It is a Dometic brand, instruction
stickers are in German, and It works, I checked it. 
Just so you know, here's what I've got in it. I'm not looking to make money
off this deal. I'd rather someone restore it and get it on the road. 
&gt; Initial Cost: $500 
&gt; 4 new tires at the PX on sale: Aprox $35 each $140 
&gt; Dash (local) $100 
&gt; Dash (guy on the internet) $60 
&gt; Bentley Manual $70 
&gt; Battery Tray $50 
Hope I answered your questions? 
Later, 
David K. Perdue
