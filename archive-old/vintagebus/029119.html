Subject: Sticky blue gunk...and new mexican motors

I wondered what that sticky blue gunk was on the motor...Thanks George!
I went and picked up a brand new mexican motor for a bus that I'm working on
today...It was hauled via semi truck...so I went and met the driver at a local gas
station/truck stop.  He was in a hurry...so i opened up the bus and he opened his
trailer.  It was on or strapped to a pallet...I can't remember....but its on a
pallet in the bus right now.  He and I lifted it into the bus...it really wasn't
that bad.  I opened up the box to check for damage...no damage... good.  I sign the
papers and off he goes.  I drive home and inspect the engine further...and tote it
around to show off to all of my friends.  They like it.  I do too.  I pulled a
spark plug out of the head just to peer in there.  I thought these things were test
run?  The spark plug is absolutely clean.  There is oil in the case too...a little
low...but its in there.  The oil is clean as can be too.  I might pull a head off
just to peer in there and see what new stuff actually looks like :)

I like this motor...and wish it was mine...but it isn't.. oh well.   I ordered it
from Ronnie... decent delivery (that wasn't their fault that I live in a
residential area).. good price...and excellent service!  The only gripe I have is
that the new motors come with new doghouse oil coolers... but no adapters... what
gives?
The casting flash isn't bad at all...and will only take a few minutes of filing.

I like how clean it is...everything is new and clean... I think I'll ahve to
repaint that oily tin just to make everything nice and clean inside.  An EMPI
degree pulley, and CB Performance Mini-Sump will compliment this engine too...maybe
some dual carbs eventually?  not my decision....not my engine.

All in all...I like it.  I'll let you all know how it goes...but it seems that the
mexican engines are good...I haven't heard any bad things about them....and hey...
I got a free pallet out of the deal.  Can you ask for anything more?!

Isaiah

sorry for the late night ramblings....

&gt;
&gt; I use a dab of Hylomar on the threads.  Never hardens, but seems to be
&gt; thick enough to prevent leaks.
&gt;
&gt; VW of Mexico uses Hylomar (or something very similar) on the case parting
&gt; line.
