Wow...  I would think that a self-professed sub-hatch 
flip-seat westy expert who is thinking of doing his 
own westy-zine would know that flip-seats were 
availible from Westfalia all the way through 1967... 

I have seen two examples of flip seat westys that 
were post sub-hatch era and even a 1967 highroof 
panel with a flip-seat installed.
