Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat weight

hey hi !

im in Canada, and one guys asked me to ship my baywindows middle seat from
shawinigan/canada to Hawaii/US, weight is not important as they are looking
at width, height and lenght, but Canada post refuse to send it they said it
was too big, the sending aborted, but i guess purolator or UPS could had
done it (small town Canada post seems too much hassle to ship for them) or
the best could be some kind of truck shipping as a lot of trucks/van go from
East to West, just a guess look at your local truck shipping, im sure they
are often going to Totonto back to Vancouver...

Objet : [VB] middle seat weight


Just wondering if anyone has shipped a bus middle seat (full width 1965)
lately and knows approximately what one weighs? I'm trying to figure out how
to get one from Toronto, Canada to Vancouver, Canada. Anyone coming out this
way? We would be happy to pay someone for their trouble.
Thanks &amp; Regards
Chris &amp; Gina
