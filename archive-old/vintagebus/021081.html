Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] importing goods to USA

I really hate to get into this one but I used to export Fire Trucks to
Mexico and lands South.
All it takes to get a passenger vehicle across the border is a title and
one simple form that you can fill out at the border customs office or you
can file in advance. 
New vehicles are another ball game all together.... Yada, Yada EPA etc.
etc., but if it has that little EPA placard on the door post it is still
simple as long as it is a standard model it'll go.
As for the Canadian side they have their own rules and you should check
with them.
http://www.customs_dot_ustreas_dot_gov  US Customs website, you can search the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule or the Part 19 Federal Rules at this site.
And guys.... If you want to see how difficult it is to be a customs
broker go to my site at  http://customsbroker_dot_netfirms_dot_com/  and take a
few of the Customs Brokers Test that I have up there.
Just think of it this way. You're not doing anything illegal so you can
just drive across and file the entry form later.
Now that is a fact.

&gt; Hi Everett
&gt; I had others ask too, What paper work is required?
&gt; A title, a sales receipt, anything else? 
&gt; 
&gt; Lets say I was transporting YOUR car to YOUR state,, Can I pay the 
&gt; tax / duty
&gt; for you?
&gt;

&gt; &gt; They were probably asking for my benefit, that's pretty cool...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I called the USA border office today in Buffalo, NY and they said 
&gt; there is
&gt; &gt; no problem bringing across any car over 25 years old, you just 
&gt; have to pay a
&gt; &gt; duty fee of 4% of the first $1000, 2% of the next $1000, etc..  I 
&gt; stopped
&gt; &gt; listening after the 4% because no VW would cost more than $1000, 
&gt; that would
&gt; &gt; be just crazy, right?
