Subject: Bus progress and a question  (65 Samba)
Message-ID: &lt;371AB44E.16D1C345_at_deltanet_dot_com&gt;

I made 2 monumental step's in my restoration of my 65 21 window deluxe
this weekend.  I both finished painting the body and re-assembled the
first pieces.

Well,  after 12+ months, it feels good to finally get the last coat of
paint on.  It also feels good to put something together for a change.
It is kind of nice to take all the small pieces and make one big one
again.  (I just have to remember how it all goes together.)

What i put together were 2 of my pop out windows.  Doing this raised a
question.  Where is the Sekirt (SP?)(Small logo) logo suposed to go and
on which side? (Inside or outside)  My bus has 6 pop outs.   I am
probably being way too anal here, but if you going to do it, mite as
well do it right.  Anyone have either some good original pictures, a
original bus or maybe just the answer for me?

My thought is that VW assembled these all the same (as far as Logo
orintation) and let them fall were ever they fall.  Seams like the bus's
i have seen have the logo on the rear top corner of the frame.  I have
seen the logo both inside and outside.  Any official info out there?

Thanks
Matthew
