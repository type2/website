Subject: Paint Code Problem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am trying to find a close match to L-82 Silver-White, the local paint 
stores can't find the mixing formula for this color since it was used as a 
&quot;trim&quot; color for bumpers and wheels. Does anybody have a paint color code 
that is a close match? 

Dan
