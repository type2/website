&lt;&lt; Thanks for posting a positive note on your transaction. I've been in 
 this hobby for a number of years and the anti-Japanese viewpoint has 
 always bugged me. People get paranoid sounding like it's a plot to 
 rid the US of every VW. &gt;&gt;

Wasn't try real hard (well, maybe just a little) to make a political 
statement.  It was an excellent transaction from my standpoint.  

I have also been a little frustrated in the past by the anti-Asian sentiment. 
 Funny how *some* VW people think it is fine for US folk to buy stuff from 
Europe and bring back to the states, but it is a cardinal sin to sell 
something to Asia.  Doesn't sound quite right to me.

At BBTA and other large VW events there are all sorts of people - everyone 
from the &quot;Tattooed youth&quot; to the big $$ collectors and people living out of 
their bus to retirees.  I think it is great how all these folks with 
different back grounds and socioeconomic status can get together and have a 
good time.  I would like to see that attitude extended a bit more.
