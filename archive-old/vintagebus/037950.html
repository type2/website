&lt;&lt; nope, you got made fun of for   &quot;needing&quot;   correct glass.  There's a 
difference.   did you ever get it, BTW? &gt;&gt;

Some yes.....still missing some pieces.
I was actually assembling the glass right now.
5 popouts together and installed.......both safaris together.......
Rear window in, assembling the drivers side front door frame.
Fudging with the front vent window to make it open/shut nicely.......still am 
not happy.
Boy that was tough to change the vent frame glass to frame seal.
Vent is too diffucult to open/close........maybe after the rubber sets.......?
I think I need more practice to make everything work just right.
Right now I just want to drive it. =)
