I personally have used the 113 501 315H Germann (they are blue) seals on all
my buses in the last 5 years. I now have 34,000 miles on my DD and do not
and have never had a rgb seal leak, also on my 62 panel that has an ungodly
amount of miles on the trans in it with-out a leak since switching to the
blue seals, 1 thing I do before instalation is polish the seal race before
installation and I also have the proper size seal installer that presses the
seal in equally, so it doesn't twist or tweek. The biggest problem I have
found with seal leakage is an improperly installed seal, the wrong seal or a
grove worn in the seal race, the reason I polish mine before install. I have
probally installed these in at least 50 plus buses and have sold countless
numbers of these seals without a problem. If I sold you the seal and you are
having problems send it back, I'll replace it or send me your seal carrier
and race, I'll install the seal and polish the race for you.

ps. make sure all parts are spotless, grit from a brake drum spline or from
the seal holder can cause a leak, it doesn't take much.

Do you have a big nut trans?  Ronnie sent me some for that that are for
IRS bug I think? to use on big nut setup.  I've had the same problem as
Thom.  It doesn't seem like
it would be that difficult to replace seals, but I've put in two and the
second leaks worse than the first.  On the second it sat for a day before
it started to leak.
