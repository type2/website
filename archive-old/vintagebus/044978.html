Hi Woody,
Right you are!  Also if this filter screen is completely missing the outlet
tube of the gas tank is easily clogged with anything in the tank.  One fella
we heard about from a local VW shop had this terrible problem with a late
1960s bug.  It would just stop running for no apparent reason and five
minutes later would restart with no problem until it stopped again days or
minutes later.  After going through all of the fuel system in the engine
compartment.  They removed the gas tank and upon draining it found one of
those styrofoam seals that keep your bottle of gas additive from being
tampered with before you buy it.  Seems that the VWs owner had poured a
bottle of this gas additive into his bug, but had only partly removed this
anti-tamper seal.  While the additive drained the seal came the rest of the
way off and fell into the tank.  Since there was no brass filter sock over
the outlet the styrofoam seal floated around till it got sucked to the tip of
the outlet.  There it would stay for five mintues due to the vaccume formed,
then when the vaccume bled off the seal would float away till later to be
sucked down again.
  Will the madness never end!  Eric&amp;Barb
