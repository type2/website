Hi Volks,
Forgot to mention when using a SC to make sure to put the heaviest stuff 
right behind the cab where it will be distributed over the four wheel 
somewhat evenly.  Then put the light stuff over and behind the rear wheels.  
Barb once loaded up all of our magazines for sale in the rear hatch of the 
1960 panel.  Made it drive like riding a horse up on it's hind legs.  Very 
wobbly steering!    Eric&amp;Barb
