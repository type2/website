Jason's post reminded me of a naging problem my 65 Westy will need fixed
when I finish the rockers.  How should I go about fixing the typical
lower winshield seam rust?  Should I cut out the bottom for the frame
and replace  or just neutralize the rust (POR 15) and build up the
seam?  

If cutting and replacing is best, any tips on where/how to cut and
paste??

it depends on how bad it is rusted - which means you don't know how much work
it is till the window is out.    almosts always the whole area has to be
stripped (the only time I didn't have to do this was on my bug which had shiny
red paint on the window sills, excet I ha to do the rear one)   I like a wire
wheel on a grinder (use eye and ear ptection, and make sure the area where
things will fly has nothing to be damaged- wire wheel will send specks of
metal which make tiny mars in glass/paint- so draping may be appropriate.
Rust holes can be welded up and ground down, and  por15 or other rust
neutaliser then primer used and spot putty and sanded smooth - smothness being
the trick to getting the seal to seal, and primer and paint and letting it all
dry and using roofing tar before putting the window in and then life is
groovy.       
If the rust holes are big (sticking finger through, not just pinholes)  yes
you should weld in a patch.     I haven't used replacements, but have taken
uprights out of junk buses, which are good for the flat areas.    

 seal up where the wiper pivots go through or you will still get water in
thepackage tray.

Hey Jason, I think I have a spare rear hatch, if yours is really gone.   If
the bus is going to be outside for a while - maybe get a tarp and put some
thing between the bus and the tarp for an air pocket and bungee down the
corners.
