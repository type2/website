ok here is my PERSONAL opinion on the creative engineering safaris...

They were shipped out pretty quick and they were real nice people.
The frames looked pretty good and i liked the latches and most of the 
hardware.
I think they could have improved the wingnuts though.
It was real tough getting the rubber in the frames but finally did it.
The pssenger side frame was a litte tweaked and rubbed. off about 1/4&quot;
All in all i say that they are on the right track but not quite there yet.  

Just My PERSONAL opinion
