Subject: Re: [VB] Milk Crate Police



&gt;I still have a couple of the good 'ol all-metal crates.  It'll be pretty
&gt;hard to bust me for them though, since the dairys involved are long
&gt;defunct!

You must not live in Pennsylvania! One time in Pissburgh, I cleaned out my
parent's basement of all the books I didn't want to drag back to Texas...
they were all in various plastic milk crates from 9 or 10 dairies,
convenience stores, etc, mostly defunct, some not.
I couldn't figure out why the used bookstore staff was stalling on the buy,
looking at me funny, whispering, etc.
Finally, another customer came up and said &quot;they're calling the police;
they get a REWARD for turning you in!!&quot;
Needless to say, I got my books and left, leaving a few choice words for
the owner.
