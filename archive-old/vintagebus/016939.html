If you hadn't been able to stop, I'm sure it would have made a big &quot;bong&quot;
when you ran into the back of someone...  Talk about losing your marbles...
It would have taken all day to knock those out of the intersection!

&gt; I once hauled 4500 lbs of glass marbles in my '57.  Took all my weight on
&gt; the break to stop.  Starting was so slow that the light changed 3/4 of the
&gt; way across the intersection.  Everything seem OK after.  BTW, the marbles
&gt; were melted down for glass blowing.
