 We have new vent window latches for $9.00 each. They are not NOS, but they
are very good quality.
 
 
 Thank You!

As the weather gets colder the need for vent wing latches on my Binz gets
greater.  Noticed it was quite a chilly ride in this morning!!  Would love
to
have NOS but anything in good shape will do.  Not sure which years would
be
correct.  Need both left and right.  Any help appreciated!
Thanks,
