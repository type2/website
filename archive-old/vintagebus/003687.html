&gt; Just as a warning, this will be a long one.

Welcome to the world of running busses.....
Glad to hear that yours is up and running...
Don't feel too bad about the amount of money you have put into it....Most of
us have a lot more than that in ours, just did it slower than you did.  I
would venture a guess that like myself most listees will do a little work
and then wait to see how things are going before progressing on to the next
step.  So, in one way you are ahead of the game by having as much done as
you have.

Enjoy your bus and watch the people you meet on the road enjoy it too.  A
nice looking bus never fails to bring a smile to the faces of people in
parking lots all over the country.  Strangers will suddenly come up to you
and treat you like a long lost friend while telling you about the old VW Bus
that the used to have. I've met some very interesting people that would
never have given me the time of day if I hadn't been driving my van so, be
prepared.

Jon
