It's true, they're almost extinct.  The end of an era.  Is there a List for
drive-in fans?

I suppose an alternative would be to drag the tube into the backyard
Saturday night, tune it to Speedvision's &quot;Lost Drive-In&quot;, park your Type 2
in viewing position, and enjoy the movie and Bruce Dern's quips and
commentary.  A poor substitute for the real deal, but better than nothing.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Here in L.A. area there are currently 0 operating drive in theaters.
All have been sold for their land by the big movie theater chains to be
developed to more shopping centers or some other lame waste of space.  Just
5-10 years they were plentiful ...now there are none.  &lt;&lt;
