Oh my god, that is so badass!!!  I'm going to cruise out to the Classic in it and yell at people...  &quot;Move your POS Deluxe, a$$hole!!&quot;

Combine that Bus with that '54 Firetruck Single Cab that was on my site with the 3 searchlights in the bed and you could roll up on someone's house at 3 am and scare the living crap out of them...

&quot;This is the police!  Come out of the house NOW or we start shooting!&quot;

LOL

This is a new one on me...pretty cool though!  I wonder what the reserve is?
