Subject: Re: [VB] Back under a bus after 30 years! Transaxle question. 

and the rythym... i mean period, or time of each 'woo' changes with the 
speed.   there will be a speed where the woowoowoos go away.   like when the guitar 
string's in tune. 
  I guess that's where you are supposed to drive.

I like your description of bad bearing. &quot;woowoowoo&quot; like out of tune guitar
strings is a bad bearing. I have been trying to imagine that it is my cheap
tires instead. At this point I would like to be in denial about the need for
a rebuild. Just keep saving up and don't drive too far from home.
