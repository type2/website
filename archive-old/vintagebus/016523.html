yeah, well i paid $90 for 6 mos. to add the bus to my policy. thats for 
liability only of course.

its so funny when people see you and the bus... its like they MUST say 
something, and the year is the only question they can come up with. 
(although i have gotten the heat question once or twice) and when you tell 
them the year... theres always that pause (they cant think of another 
question) and then, &quot;its nice, see ya&quot;
