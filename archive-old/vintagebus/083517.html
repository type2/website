Subject: Re: [VB] re:underside update....

I'd be concerned about the working temperature of the undercoating. Did you use POR15?  I can't remember if it's affected by temp. 

I've used the cheap &quot;chip&quot; brushes from Harbor Fright with POR15 and they held  up pretty good. Did the foam dissolve into the undercoating? You're adding an ingredient! 

My son had the black wrist syndrome when I saw him at Thanksgiving. He's working on a BMW 2002.

&gt; -do it in warmer weather, my hands were pretty damn cold
&gt; -latex gloves work, and do not disintegrate. Unfortunately I got a big drop
&gt; at the wrist, and didn't realize it. So black wrist for a few days...it
&gt; doesn't really wash off.
&gt; -buy lots of foam brushes, as they disintegrate rather quickly. I probably
&gt; used about 20.
