Are you wanting to buy &amp; sell VW stuff, but want to avoid the sleaze and
stigma of other auction sites, yet still desire an &quot;auction&quot; format?  Now
you can!

Introducing VintageBus Auction! - http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/auction

So what makes VintageBus Auction different than any other auction site?
This auction site uses *sealed* bids, not the bastardized quasi-proxy
bidding of the other sites.  When you enter a bid, nobody but *you* knows
what the bid amount is until the end of the auction.  Not even the
seller gets to know what people have bid!  At the end of the auction,
high-bidder takes it.  It's as simple as that.

No more shills.  No more bid shielding.  No more last-minute bidding wars. 
No more sniping.  No more forgetting to bid on something because you wanted
to wait until the last second.  And because the other bidders don't see
your bid, there is none of the random BS that occurs on certain
other sites.  (Anyone recall the double-flip bus middle seat a few weeks ago?)

Best of all, it's free for VW stuff!  Got some extra parts you want to clean
out of the garage?  Here's your chance!

Check it out - feedback welcome.  

If someone on VintagVW and some of the other lists could forward this on,
that would be appreciated!
