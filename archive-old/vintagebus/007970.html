&gt; same meter that I bought from them a couple of years back.  So here I was
&gt; talking racing stuff with Clyde.  That was an experience I'll treasure for
a
&gt; long time.

    clyde berg is cool... during the vw classic, bill may and his son
stopped by my booth to pick up some videotape. clyde made a brief
appearance, and i got 'em all introduced, but there just wasn't enough time
to talk vw's.

    if any of you want to see clyde in action, you can download a killer
wheelstand video clip i have of him from the phoenix bug-o-rama... he got
three-wheel air, it's the same pass that made the cover shot of hotvw's on
7/00.

    at sacramento in may, clyde broke the front suspension of the car after
he came down hard from a giant second-gear wheelstand... it is sometimes
difficult to resolve the concept of his fully aggro driving style, when
compared to meeting him in person   :-)
