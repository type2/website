Oh no.  Does this mean we have to abandon this thread?  It's become a nice
&quot;love your bus&quot; segment!

--- Isaiah &lt;punkerbat_at_vbe_dot_com&gt; pondered:
&gt; How would we get back
&gt; home after driving the bus to
&gt; the next destination?

Ah, there lies the rub.  I'm not too sure, but based
on the responses back, I don't think I'll even attempt
this.  If I buy the bus, I'll probably fly out and
take the adventure myself back home
