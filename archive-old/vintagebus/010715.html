&gt;  As for my front end, I ended up just purchasing a
&gt;  complete drum-2-drum front end, in good shape for
&gt;  under $200.  I have heard that just replacing the
&gt;  whole front end takes about 25% of the time as
&gt;  replacing the springs and is a surer bet.  Dealing
&gt;  with the springs is sd to be a bitch.

actually it is not too bad.  I would much rather replace springs than a beam. 
  There should be a blow by blow description of unlowwering the front of my 
Dad's SC in the archives- it was a few years ago  (3?)    it took an 
afternoon.  Produced a much more comfortable ride-   he had been complaining 
that the front end was so jolty that he would hit his head on the roof!!!!
