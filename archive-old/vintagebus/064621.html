&gt; Per advise of this list I am going to buy some larger tires for my son's 66
&gt; bus. He curently has 15&quot; 165's
&gt; I wanted to put 15&quot; 205's or 215's what I do not know/understand is the
&gt; third number 65's, 70's, 75's?!?! Which will &quot;fit&quot; the wheel wells of a bus
&gt; Thanks

The third figure is a percentage of height and width. So a 75 figure means 
that the tyre is 75% high as it is wide. If no figure is metioned it is about 
83%. The width is the figure to watch for but the aspect ratio will have a 
effect on gearing a ride comfort. I hope this helps. Mike
