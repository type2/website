  When I bought my 62 single, a friend and I went up to look at it. After
deciding to buy it we called AAA, and had it towed under my AAA plus account.
I had figured where the 100 mile mark was from the place I was when I bought
it, you get a hundred free miles with AAA plus. Well I had then conveinently
drop it at a gas station that was closed that day (Sunday), we went to eat and
called AAA again, make sure that the friend you take also has AAA plus. All in
all I had my Single cab hauled about 200 miles, for about 20.00 (10.00 tip for
each driver) and gas to go look at the beast.
