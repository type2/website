&gt;&gt;&gt; I was wondering if anybody has ever seen this truck in person:

&gt;&gt; Nice truck! Still seems priced high, but what do I know?  What was he asking

If it's as nice as it looks, it should be worth that to someone? But then
what they are worth &amp; what people will pay for them are not necessarily the
same in the VW world?
