:radius. The whole corner is more square on a truck bumper. On the ribbed
:that I saw the bumper bends in about a 2 or 3 inch inside radius at the
:corners. On the buses it's closer to a 6 inch radius. Same thing on the
:slash i saw, the curve radius is tighter. I think the bus bumper has a
:gentle arc from end to end also, although this may be due more to age and
:abuse than design. The truck bumpers I've seen are dead straight from end to
:end. 

I noticed this also when comparing the bumpers side-by-side. The bus bumper on Rosie curves out away from the body in the middle, the truck bumper was straight.
