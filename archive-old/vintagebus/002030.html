You're not the only one that's yawning. Your post kind of remind me of my
former '64 Sundial. Every time I started something it looked like there is
more to it that I can handle. Don't get scared. The best thing I found out
is to get it completely sand blasted. This way you get  clean, rust and
paint free body that you can start from scratch on. Otherwise it's a step by
step process of removing, cleaning, painting and assembling back kind of
thing. Enjoy it.

Later,

&gt; I am hoping this post doesn't end up being a confession.
&gt;
&gt; I have been mulling it over, and I've decided to be somewhat intimidated
by
&gt; the sheer amount of work I need to do to properly restore and protect my
'67
&gt; Kombi.  Every part I take off for cleaning or replacement, I find
something
&gt; new underneath/behind it.  An endless list of bushings, boots, and seals,
&gt; rust to be neutralized in every crevice, and so many components that must
be
&gt; removed to really do the job right.  I think the most daunting is the
&gt; undercarriage.  After studying the condition of things under there
&gt; (good/serviceable, but in need of P.M.), I realized that I &quot;should by all
&gt; means&quot; remove the front beam for access to the light rust that is
developing
&gt; on the underfloor above.  I don't know if I can!  My garage/shop is
already
&gt; inundated with parts that I've been removing, and I can't just toss all
&gt; non-VW related stuff out!  So I don't have enough space to spread my van
out
&gt; in pieces....oh well.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, to make a long post short (a little late on that one, I guess!), I
&gt; am thinking I should (mostly for economical reasons) use Rustoleum
&gt; &quot;Hammerite&quot; on the underfloor, where the rust isn't really bad, it's just
&gt; there....and use the expensive POR-15 on critical spots, or where there is
&gt; really some damage  (like the door I just bought....it's really gonna be a
&gt; fun one!_at_#!*%$!   On the inside of the wheelwells will also be some kind
of
&gt; rubberized undercoating.
&gt;
&gt; I'll quit yammering and go to bed.
&gt;
&gt; Later,  Gene
