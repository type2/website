Subject: Ready, Set...REBUILD! Part 2

Okay all - I got my parts back from Blair, NE yesterday.  The shop had to
drill 3 indentations in the flywheel, grind out underneath 3 of the pistons,
grind on the crank, and the rods.  Nothing was left untouched.  The guy told
me that it balanced really well - the crank was slightly out of balance but
&quot;...man, those rods were a son of a bitch...&quot;  By the looks of things they
did need to be worked over rather thoroughly.

So tonight, I went out to the shop and proceeded to spend about 5 hours
assembling the bottom end.  I'm ready to put the case-halves together but I
don't have a spool of silk thread.  I'll have to go pick up a spool
tomorrow.  Does anyone here have any advice on just what kind of silk
thread?  Any difference in size?  How about color preference?  Okay - just
kidding on the color but seriously, are there different guages of thread
(like course, medium, and fine)?

I also called the guru as I was typing this message and I asked him if I
have to use those special sealing nuts on the 6 main engine studs.  The
reason I ask is that I have a set of BugPack engine hardware and all they
included were giant nylock nuts and washers.  Anyone have any comments on
this?  It would seem to me the sealing nuts would be the more leak-free way
to go but then again, how can I argue with his 'hundreds of rebuilt engines&quot;
vs. my 1?

That's it for this time.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll be picking up my heads and
joining the case-halves.  We'll see how it goes.  Later!

Erin
