&gt;I have a friend who reinstalled his engine by setting it on his chest and pulling the bus over himself, but I think I prefer the jack.

Hey John, does your friend also work at the Daily Planet as a mild
mannered reporter?

OBC - I bought one of those SUV floor jacks at Se_at_rs, since my standard
2 ton jack only goes up to 15 inches and just barely raises the bus to
change a tire. It has a longer fulcrum and it only takes one or two
pumps to get the support up to the sump or torsion bars and it's only a
little larger than a regular jack.
