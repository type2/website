&gt;Can steering wheels be powdercoated?

Most powdercoating product requires a metal
surface that will accept a static charge to attract
and hold the material.
The curing process requires the powder to be heated
to 400 degrees F for 10 to 15 minutes.Think pizza.
The full bake time will vary with the mass of the part .
I don't think a steering wheel will make a very good
candidate for the process. It will melt.
However, there is a push in the industry for a product
which will apply to other base materials, like wood
paneling, along with low-temp cure, including UV light.
Hang on, with the way things are going, it will be here soon.
