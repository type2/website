&lt;&lt; Or do I? The diagram on this page shows the swing of the arch (A, B, C)
 towards the back of the bus. That is C position is downward, B is 45. to the
 rear and A is upward, precariously close to the starter solenoid. Is that
 correct?&gt;&gt;
Hi Glen,
Yes, that is correct!  You have to make sure that the end of the cable never
touches the solinoid and possibly gound out the voltage there or you could
end up with another fire.

&lt;&lt;You suggest varnish clogging up the mechanism.  Do you think I might be
able to blow this out with compressed air or am I back to another
disassemble?&gt;&gt;
You might be able to blow it out, though be carefull not to over do it.  In
the end it might be just a better idea to dissassemble the reserve switch to
clean and polish it's workings.  Do be carefull of the vlave gasket it is
only made of cork with some type of coating on it.  So it is easy to break.

 &lt;&lt;I'll try the air first. I quess I'll need to run the tank near empty and
then try to borrow an air line for the gas line.&gt;&gt;
Hmm, we would suggest a nearly full tank and this would need less air to
pressurize the tank and lessen the chances of explosion due to less vapors.
It was recently found out that filling plastic gas cans that were sitting in
plastic lined truck beds caused static electricity and when the fuel nozzle
was brought close to the container creating a ground.  BOOM!

&lt;&lt; When I get this sorted out I'll definitely keep in mind your advice about
using the reserve now and then. I rarely, if ever used this position, which
may have contributed to the problem.&gt;&gt;
Right that really bothered my dad when he dissassembled it and found the fuel
trapped in the valve had turned into a thick jell clooging things.

 &lt;&lt;But what is the source of the varnish? All this started with an engine bay
fire which had the bus sitting in the barn for three months before I could
get to it. Could gas break down so quickly? &gt;&gt;
It would be hard to say and could be all those reasons.  Eric&amp;Barb
