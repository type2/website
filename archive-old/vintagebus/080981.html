Subject: Re: [VB] No Response - 2nd Try: Help Tuning My Bus

My reason is hearing people w/dual carbs repeatedly talk about messing with 
them.  Though that doesn't mean it's so for everyone,  a couple guys who have 
dual carbs told me that if someone says they don't have to retune them it just 
ain't so.  That's my two cents.    I got my stylee new 1600 manual choke 
single carb in the mail, hope it'll make life better this winter.

No, what's funny is when people who don't have dual carbs think those of 
us who do spend so much time on them. Just for the record, I don't spend 
any more time tuning my bus with dual carbs than I do tuning my truck 
which has a single carb. I rarely fool with the carbs on either one.

I like my electronic ignition too. 8^)
