&lt;&lt; I bled the brakes a few times, but I still have to pump up the brakes.  
Should I rip the MC apart to check it or adjust again and bleed again? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Did you tighten the adjusting stars up until the brakes in all of the drums 
drag?  Then bleed the brakes!  To bleed single circuit LHD brakes you start 
with the right rear bleeder valve, left rear, right front, and end with the 
left front.  With dual circuit you start with the right front, left front, 
and then right rear, left rear.  Lastly back off the adjusting stars to the 
point that the barely drag, and enjoy!   Eric&amp;Barb
