Exactly, the &quot;Panels with Tents Club&quot; is what I had in
mind, but the Vintage Nazi faction harrassed poor John
in Atlanta so relentlessly that he took the panel I
wanted off the market. I guess he's taken it back into
his laboratory to coat that purple primer with Teflon
for the next time he tries to sell it.
By the way...if I take a stock panel bus and attach a
tent to it, does that make it a POS custom that I can
never suck my money back out of??

Forget what those Vintage Nazis have to say, I
personally support high prices for everything- Custom
or bone stock. 

I thought that some of those guys were only sniffing
around for common sense and appropriate pricing. I
didnt think that anyone was harassed. (one R)

Of course, &quot;Poor brow beaten John&quot; can still sell you
the panel and you can still pay $10,000 for it. Thank
God and American Freedom. You can *still* step up to
the plate!. I'm sure that he'd love to hear from you.
Maybe one of the non-regularly contributing list
members could provide you with John's email, phone
etc. You could just fly down and drive it home without
a mechanical worry. Hey, its a ready to roll $10,000
bus, Right?
Money should be no object seeing as it is clearly
worth the investment of your money. I see no reason to
worry about getting money &quot;back out&quot; of it. If you
intend to be satisfied then you will have no notion
toward ever selling. Therefore no problems! Anyone
telling you  that you can't attach a tent to your
$10,000 primered and slammed, deluxe barndoor roofed,
double door panel is clearly over stepping their
bounds. I support your upcoming purchase. We look
forward to hearing about the progress of your paint
job and minor detailing. What the heck you will have a
potential $30,000 in equity once finished.
Good luck.

BTW: If the same ol' people are writing in &quot;all of the
time&quot; then does that mean that more people should be
writing in and contributing to the list? 
Or is the goal of the list to have zero contents?
Where are all of the other listees? Off building
customs for future investment?
