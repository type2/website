&gt;  In fact, VW would just
&gt; as soon lose that part of their history that reminds potential customers
&gt; of underpowered, poorly heated, noisy vehicles driven by hippies.

This may be true, but it is very short sighted.  Why then , if this is a
profitable strategy, do most (if not all) other manufactures still support their
older vehicles and the collector market as well?  Isn't a 1958 Corvette under
powered, cold and noisy compared to a 2001 Vette??  Yet, Chevrolet still
sanctions the after market for these cars as well as reproduces parts with a
factory stamp.  VW is using flawed logic with respect to selling new cars at the
expense of the classic after market.  A certain percentage of people will always
buy new cars.  All the current VW strategy will do is to keep potential buyers
(that happen to be classic car enthusiasts too) from buying new cars at least
VW's new cars.

Cutting the nose off to spite the face comes to mind.
