&gt; Damn - looks like VWoA is going for the juglar veins now.  RMMW does rate
&gt; farily high in my book - second to Ronnie's www.oldvolks_dot_com shop.  I just
&gt; don't know why VW has got to be such a PITA about things.  They should
work
&gt; with the aftermarket community and not against it.  By VW refusing to
supply
&gt; parts and obsoleting them, they've created the market where unlicensed,
&gt; fake, aftermarket merchandise is almost a necessity.  T-Shirts and so
forth
&gt; I can understand but what about those cheap repop parts that I can't get
in
&gt; original form because VW NLA'd them?

Amen, brother NQ.

I also have some quarter with RMMW. They have fairly good and reasonably
priced bus stuff. But, don't &quot;even&quot; think about buying T3 stuff from them.
They consistantly advertise and even tell you on the phone that a T3 part
will work, it hardly ever does.

You are right on about VWOA though. When I call dealers to ask about air
cooled parts, all I get is a snotty comment or a insulting giggle.
