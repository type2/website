Hi Roger and Trudi
 A comment back to Paul.  Is the &quot;tin
&gt;on top of the cylinders&quot; the cylinder shrouds. I am relatively new to
&gt;VWs, but from the Bugpack Quick Reference Guide the dual ports heads
&gt;were first used in '71. I think the doghouse shroud also started in 
'71.
&gt;Sooo, there was not a doghouse shroud used on a single port engine,
&gt;which would mean a different tin for the doghouse setup would not be
&gt;available for a single port head. But, when I get the engine rebuilt
&gt;adding dual port heads will I need to watch for the correct dual port
&gt;cylinder shroud?
&gt;
Correct, 71. 
The doghouse conversion is easy on a single port. You need and 
apparently have: a correct fan, cooler and stand, and a fan shroud from 
71 and on bug motors. The studs are replaced with ones with one end 
larger then the other and then the correct gaskets (oil cooler seals) go 
in. Thats it I believe. The single port tin around the cylinders is 
different then dual port tin, but these are pieces seperate from the fan 
shroud itself. I understand you might change to a dual port, but take a 
look into the archives about single ports. I find they last longer and 
eliminate the problems associated with 3 piece manifolds. I have changed 
enough manifold boots (correct term?) to know that they wear out, which 
I think is due to the ethonol in current gasoline. 
By the way use Bugpack as a reference but DONT use their products if you 
can help it. I have found them shoddy compared to other manufactures.
Cant help you with the foam for the oil cooler, but the archives must 
contain something about that, I think I remember Clara saying something 
about that not too long ago. I use whatever used foam I have from old 
ones and it works fine.
