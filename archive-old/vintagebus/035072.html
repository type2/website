 I recently installed a new seal kit in my left reduction box to stop a minor
 but significant leak.  I failed.  Why did I fail?  Should I be using
 sealant?  How does the fact that oil was still dripping slowly but surely
 down the sealing face of the gasket and brake plate affect things?  I did
 torque the four bolts to spec per Bentley....what might I have missed?
 
 It's a '66, BTW &gt;&gt;


did you drain the RGBox oil before replacing the seal.  ?
