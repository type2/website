What's needed in terms of hosting.  List out what you need to
happen.

From the posts over the weekend if I remember correctly it needs to contain 
a page for each:

1. Calendar
2. Location/Facility
3. Financial
4. Message Post?
5. Pic Post to send in entries for Critique
6. Banner Ad for my latest adult site.(No that wasn't really me....)
7. Tool, equipment, materials, etc.

I am sure that these six would be a great start and can be modified as 
needed. Others will probably chime here with some of the things that I have 
missed or am wrong about. (That's why I love the List.)

TravelOn,
