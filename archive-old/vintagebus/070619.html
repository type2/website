Subject: Serial Number cross reference

I have recently bought a split windscreen transporter that I will be
restoring.  I am not sure of the year model.  I got the following info
from the plate on the doorsill:

Model               234
Serial number    237 0954 82
Order Number    4/1615
Paint                 0
(The bus is in South Africa)

Can anyone help me on the year model, or refer me somewhere that I can
find it?

What would be the first manual to buy  the VW manual from Bently
publishers?
