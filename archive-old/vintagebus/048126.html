Im in serious need for somepre-62 doglegs and a pre-62 right rocker.
If *ANYONE* has something at *ANY* price, please email me.
Also, I'm making the trip form Ventura, Ca. to Busses by the bridge/Lake 
Havasu City, Az. so if anyone needs some stuff moved, p-mail me.
I'm traveling 101S, 134E, 210E, 10E, 95N and leaving sometime Thursday 
night/Friday morning. Reverse order Sunday Afternoon.
Also if you see a rusty primered 57 standard stranded on the side of the 
road, feel free to honk, wave, and laugh, hey, maybe even stop. =)
Thanks-
Greg
