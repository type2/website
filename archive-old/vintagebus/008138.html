How can I tell if the wiper arms on my 67 are repro or original?  Reason I
ask is that I bought a pair of those external disconnects for the safari's
and when I tried to fit them, the &quot;U&quot; shaped part of the disconnect hits the
wiper arm spring, not letting the wiper rest on the window.  If my wiper
arms are incorrect, does anyone have the right ones I can buy?  Tanks.
