&gt; OK OK nough said,,, then I should get both heads new. The only reason I'm
&gt; looking to replace it is because one of the heads has broken off exhaust

Hey Andre,
When you get the new heads be sure to clean up the casting flash in the
fins.  You will notice they won't have the little piece of tin in bottom
middle where the thermostat rod goes through.  I don't know how important
this piece is, but I always put it in and even saftey wire it sometimes.
