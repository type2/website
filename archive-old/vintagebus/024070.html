Subject: Vegas Trip report. (short)

Well,  Got back from Vegas Monday night.  I was there for buisness over
the weekend.  Unfortionetly, i did not see a single pre 67 bus the whole
time.  Oh well.  I did see a few interesting VW related items in the
Imperial Pallace Auto collection.

They have a 57 rag top on display.  It was nice.  Tan interior and red
exterior.  NOS roof rack on it.  the color did not look right to me, but
i may have been wrong.  It was nice though.  Looked to be done
correctly.

Saw quite a few none VW, German car's with lot's of SWK electrical
parts.  The best was a set of semiphores off a early 30's benz.  some
sort of limmo.

The best thing there was a set of super beetle front turn len's on
Liberache's (SP?) custom 1981 coach built roadster.  A very wierd car
overall, but i found it funny that VW parts were used.

Anyway, other then that no other VW stuff to report.

Thanks
Matthew
