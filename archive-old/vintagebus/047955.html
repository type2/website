My 56, 57, and 58 all have bolts,
I'm pretty sure its a split case thing.

&lt;&lt; Hey list,

I have a spare 36mm small nut tranny I was pullin parts off of including a

Redux box half, and I noticed it had 19mm bolt head fill plugs. Not a big

deal but not the typicall 17mm *allen* head bolts I'm used to. so the Q is,

Is this from a different year (splitcase?),  or is it a 63 only 1 ton redux

half ? I know its a 36mm tranny, but i just want to make sure this half will

be ok to use. both sides top and bottom have this plug.

Dont even know if you can fit a 63 redux half on an earlier tranny, but i

wanted to make sure.
