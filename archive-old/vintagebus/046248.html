&lt;&lt; So I'll be pulling my transmission out and I'll be also
 replaceing/inspecting the bearings in my reduction boxes.  I wonder if I
 might not be easier to change my bearings and replace the seals under the
 side covers of the transmission while my transmission is in my bus.  I am
 pulling the whole thing out anyway but I just want to do it the easiest way.
 
 BTW I'm stuck with doing this work in the backyard
  &gt;&gt;
as you are pulling the trans, do it with it out, easier that way.  once you 
have the stub axle off, you can use a long pipe down the axle tube to push 
out the lower inner bearing.
