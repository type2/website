--part1_a3.29eaf8be.2a3e5d5c_boundary

hey list-
im going off to europe next month and im going to go all sorts of 
places...but the one im most looking foword to is, of ocurse, the homeland, 
WOLFSBURG!!!
if anyone has been there and has directions on how to get there on public 
transit/eurail, that be great. i actually might be moving there for a 
semester so another thing is id need a bus to drive around while im there. 
while this isnt for sure yet, any information on the following would be 
usefull:
-vw shows in europe in the month of july
-cool vw places to visit
-any vw people who are freindly to visiting vw-ites.
thanks! i wont be leving till the end of this month so keep in touch!!
