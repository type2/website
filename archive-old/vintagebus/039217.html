I have two air-coolers:
one bus, a 1966 hardtop westi.  Currently the DD :)  Yeehaa!
one Porsche, a 1979 911 SC 

Also two water-coolers:
a 1999 Cadillac Catera for the wife and family mobile
a 1971 Chevy C-10 truck for utility purposes...  Plus the three-on-the-tree
is super cool :)

I wish I kept the 1969 Beetle I had, but the wife hated it so it went....
Granted I replaced it with the 911 which the wife likes much better :)  

Doesn't the insurance kill some of you all?  I hate paying for 4 cars much
less more than that.

Want to add a pre-1972 911 to the stable eventually to create a RUF CTR
replica, yellow of course... Done correctly too, not a hack, and of course a
3.6L turbo to back it up...  The tough part will be grafting a Carrera nose
clip onto the early 911 for the suspension.  Then my collection will be
complete :)
