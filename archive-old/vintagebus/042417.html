Subject: what drill bit do i use? (trans mount mod)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003021053220.89967-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

My 61 i will be needing to replace the front trans mount on, i figure i
may as well go ahead and use the 63-67 mount with the beefier studs, but
that means i'll have to drill the nosecone out to accept the bigger studs
on this newer mount...

Since i dont have any metric drill bits, what size of imperial drill bit
do i use to make this mod?

thanks,

Steve
