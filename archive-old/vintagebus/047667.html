Now, it has a 4 speed Volvo gearbox

Hey, if this thing really has a Volvo gearbox, and a VW engine, I could 
rebuild the whole thing in my sleep!  The Volvo gear box (M4, M40, or M400) 
is the most bulletproof thing in existence.  What a combination of reliable 
components.

I want one!  (But maybe with training wheels - I haven't been on a bike in a 
few years.)
