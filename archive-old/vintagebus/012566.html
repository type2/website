Hello all,
 Was out surfin this morning &amp; ran across a good Web
page with buttloads of info &amp; neat stuff. Its at
&lt;www.kymcovw_dot_com&gt; They even carry the &quot;Torque Miester&quot;
that Ive been trying to hunt down... just imagine
torquing down the flywheel nut with ONE ARM:) They also
have info that newbies &amp; veterans both can use. It even
shows the CORRECT way to adjust a carb:) Hope youll be
as impressed as I was.
Good Friday to all &amp; have a Happy Easter
