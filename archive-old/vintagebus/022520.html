HAs anyone had any experience with MOFOCO built engines? we are thinking of
having a 1776 built, new SP heads, CW crank, balaanced, swivel adjusters,
teflon wrist pin buttons, drilled for full flow , new case, 6v flyhwheel.
Maaaybe a slightly hotter cam for better bottom end. 3 angle valve seat
job, have I missed anything?  MOFOCO gaave us a quote of $1600, didn't seem
too bad.

Alos, for added ground clearanace, I think we are going to try a set of
Super Swamper TSL Radials on the back of the '65 Westy, they are 6 ply, 6.6
inch wide tread, and 28.7 inch diameter! That shoudl help the highway speed
a little. Figure the slightly bigger engine should off-set what we lose do
to the bigger tires....and I haate getting stuck in the mud!

A month and a half and NEwfoundland here we come!   Jim
