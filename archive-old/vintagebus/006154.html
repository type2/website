Subject: Seat covers for my 66?
Date: Sun, 6 Feb 2000 14:55:27 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My 66 walkthru has a couple of moth eaten mouse pissed in seats that need
redone.  I can redo them myself but I wanted to know if anyone has a set of
back and bottom covers that would work that they would like to sell.  Color
really doesn't matter.  Puke Green, Oblivious Orange, or blems are
acceptible.  My interior is going to be a $40 TMI set that I got a couple
years ago at the KCMO swap meet so I ain't pikcy - just cheap!
