Repo dog legs are found at rmmw and ww, corners its best to used bay corners
and modify them, to be blunt it sounds like they have no clue what they are
doing or they would  know , you have to modify the repo dog legs to the
thick lips, i fab a section to do that, they also fit lousey and require
alot of reworking to get them in rite, male sure your not getting screwed ,
i'm getting a bit fed up with reworking stuff that idiots have did that were
&quot;restoration experts&quot; , and i ust that term loosly if intrested have them
contact me and i'll try to explain it, or ship it to me , and i'll fix it
rite ,grin ,later
