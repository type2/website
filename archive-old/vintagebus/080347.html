Subject: RE: [VB] RE: oil temp.

I use modified type-3 cool tin in place of the original little diversion
pans. The type-3 tins have a central excape channel which will provide
the thermostat with hot air but provides much better cooling for the
cylinders and heads, even though the head is outside the tin. I still
retain the &quot;J&quot; tin to maintain the thermostats temperature well. The
cast iron cylinders gains some cooling through conduction to the
aluminum head and when the cylinders cool better they don't transfer as
much heat to the heads. You will still notice the head temp go up and
down with power demand, but the temps will overall be lower.

A type three oil cooler in the doghouse with an electric oil temp sender
in place of the original oil pressure light switch should be a good
place to get near correct oil temps. The front of the doghouse tine will
have to have a hole drilled to allow the installation of the sensor, but
it seems like a good plan to me. Anyone tried that?

on a bone stock bus (with thermostat) how can head temps be improved?
just
by having all your tin in place and snug'd tightly? i would think that
aside
from ducting air under there, it is what it is.
