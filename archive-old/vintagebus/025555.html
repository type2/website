&gt; My question is this:  In my haste to get it running (daily driver

&gt; compartment.  I am nervous about running these lines in path of hot air.
&gt; A 40 mile freeway drive today showed temps around 210-220 (dipstick

Don,

It'll be fine. I've got two with pretty much the same oil line routing.
