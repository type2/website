Can't you just say you don't want called unless it is
an emergency?  It doesn't seem like email would be a
very quick way to obtain emergency help, particularly
since most people don't read their email every day. 
Were you getting bugged by a lot of calls even though
you said emergency only?

I think all AIRS members represent an extremely
interesting group.  Since I was planning a trip out
West in my 1980 Westie, It was great to feel some
psychological support from the AIRS network.  Frankly,
I wasn't sure if I would ever use AIRS, because if I
broke down half a state away from the nearest member I
thought it would be too much imposition to call. 
However, it might havr been good to call just to talk
through a problem or get recommendations on local
mechanics.  Sorry it wasn't working out for you.

&gt; Anyone who thinks the intent of AIRS was to create a
&gt; public help line is
&gt; wrong. I KNOW because I was there. I will gladly
&gt; entertain any listee and
&gt; if I see someone post an intention to travel to my
&gt; area I will send them a
&gt; personal invitation along with my phone#.
&gt; Others, well they can email me and if I am able to,
&gt; I will help.
&gt; I encourage everyone who signed up for AIRS to
&gt; consider the
&gt; ramafications.
