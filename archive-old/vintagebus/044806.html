&lt;&lt; Couple of questions: 
 I'm planning on buying a new long block for my bus later this year and  
 would like to have it smooth running and balanced.  Isn't there some way I 
 can achieve this without buying an assembled engine, tearing it a part, 
 replacing a major component (the crankshaft) and reassembling it?  Paying 
 $1300 for labor and material that I would just throw away seems hard to 
 justify.&gt;&gt;
It depends!  If you are trying to assemble an improved AC VW engine, buying 
one new and going through it, is about a one week of evenings.  On the other 
hand if you have time to spare you can buy good parts here and there at good 
prices.  Then put one together for about $800-1,000.00 in about two months.  
It all depends on what you have more of, time or money.
 
&lt;&lt;Second question:  You seem to like the dual carbs.  This seems to 
contradict what Bob Hoover prefers for engines that are for every day street 
use.  He doesn't like dual carbs because there is no heat riser to warm the 
air-fuel mixture.  What do you think?&gt;&gt;
If the intake manifolds are short and thick enough they tend to heat from the 
heads upward.  We have several friends who run dual carbs on SP engines, they 
seem to run well though require more attention to maintance/upkeep since 
there are twice as many parts.  Dual carbs are about as close to EFI economy 
and HP increases as you are going to get if set up correctly.  VW even used 
dual carbs on thier type 3s in the mid 1960s 1500cc engine.  On the other 
hand we have never liked anything but oil bath air cleaners and having 
pre-heat tubes.  We are going to modify a pair of 40HP air cleaners to run on 
our 1515cc Okrasa engine for our Ghia to solve these problems.  The big 
question one has to ask of themselfs is the loss of some reliability worth 
the extra HP?
 
&lt;&lt;Third question:  Does the type IV cooler fit into the doghouse cooler tin 
or 
 are some changes needed?&gt;&gt;
You have to add about an inch to the depth of the housing and the exhaust 
shell and both additions must be properly tapered to prevent buffeting the 
air flow away from the newly added cooler surfaces.  Plus add the same amount 
of tin to the L-shaped sealing bracket and weld the corner of this bracket to 
reinforce it from breaking.
 
&lt;&lt;Hope I'm not being a nuisance.  It's just that you raised some issues 
related to the engine changes I'm planning for my 71 bus.   Andrew Stockton

No Problem!  Who us raise issues?  Never!   :)  Eric&amp;Barb
