Hello all,
What is the story on those reflectors that go above the rear tail lights?
Some early busses have them some do not.  I would like maximum visibility at
night and stay vintage at the same time.  Any sources?  I always thought
that they were just a owner installed job but after looking at the set that
Everett has for sale I'm not too sure.  His look factory.  Thanks.

P.S.- My bus is driving so smooth now I have to remind my passengers its not
a Cadillac.....
