 Hey all,
 
    I'm working on the bus and I found out some wacky stuff!
 
    The front end has different year spindles!!  The bus is a '60 and the the
 drivers side somehow has a later ('64-67) spindle/brake set up?
 ...................
remember what I said about my 63 truck having one late front drum (easy off 
axle nut cap) and one early?   Haven't looked inside yet, but it might be one 
early spindle and one 63 1 ton spindle.  The link pins, are they the same 
diameter on both sides?  The 63 1 tons use the early (smaller) link pins, and 
64-67 brake parts.

hm, which is on the left and which the right?
