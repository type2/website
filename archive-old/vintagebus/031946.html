&lt;&lt; I'm wondering if now would be a good time to hook up the starter and do a
 compression check on the engine?  This is a step I regretted not doing on
 the used engine I had before.  &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
Sure you can if you want a base line.  Though you would be wise to remove the 
spark plugs first and turn it over until the oil light goes out first!  Then 
reinstall them, and do the compression check.  The rings will not be seated 
until you drive it for about 3-10,000 miles though so the readings maybe a 
bit low now. 

&lt;&lt; I should yank the rockers and recheck the torque on these head bolts.&gt;&gt;
If you torqued them on properly then you will need to retorque the lowers 
about 300 miles, if you are only 0-4 Lbs. low then you do not need to 
retorque the uppers.  Then all of the case/head fasteners about 30-40,000 
miles.

&lt;&lt;  Any need for loctite on these?&gt;&gt;
No, that would gunk up any future retorquing!   Eric&amp;Barb
