&lt;&lt; Has anyone recently replaced or removed the panel over the driver and
 passenger area?  I started on the Panel today and would bet these will be
 the hardest to duplicate.  Anyone have a pattern they's sell me or willing
 to make me a pattern?  I figure the back area shouldn't be to hard just keep
 guessing with scrap pieces.  However I'd be willing to buy a pattern of
 tho &gt;&gt;
my 65 did not have these when I got it.  I used as a template one from an old 
bus an dused 1/8 hardboard which I sprayed grey.   Is hard to fit.  think I 
had to sand the edges thinner as the original stuff I think is 2mm, it is 
definately thinner than 1/8 inch.    guessing with scrap would be a bitch.  i 
had to get the cab rook panels JUST RIGHT for them to fit.   then I cut some 
space shiney bubblewrap to shape and put a couple layers of that between the 
cab roof panels and the bus roof, mcuh cosier and looks good too
