Having now found a new ('63) body for my crashed '67, I am a little
uncertain which approach to take.
The '67 was pretty much completely rebuilt just before I crashed it, and
all the mechanicals are still spot on except the broken trans casing.
The '63 has a straight body but has a few problem areas of rust. Some of
these being the floor and a couple of little spots in the chassis.
The floor and chassis of the crashed '67 are still in really good
condition and still has all the running gear in place.
SO WHAT DO I DO ? 
Do I seperate the body from the rusty '63 floor/chassis/running gear and
swap it with the buckled body of the '67 using the still good
floor/chassis/etc. so as to effectively have the good body on the good
chassis OR
Do I fix all the rust holes in the body of the '63 and then set about
repairing or replacing the floor and then rebuilding the chassis and
running gear effectively rebuilding the whole car?

buses chassis do not unbolt like bugs do.      So if you want to swap your
good mechanicals over into a decent body that is the best option.     If the
body on the new bus isn't so great either think about do you want to fix it or
are you okay with driving it the way the body is or would it be easier to find
a better one?   There is usually a certain amount of rust and repair panels
are available.
