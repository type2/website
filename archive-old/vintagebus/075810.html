&gt; Ok Cal, I'll bite.  What makes the main seal of his so much different/better??

He says its made from silicone rubber, wears better. The oil cooler seals
are remarkably soft, resilient, and never get brittle. I end up using
them for 50,000 miles at least. And I've never had one leak. The graphite
flywheel rings are also long lasting and pliable.
