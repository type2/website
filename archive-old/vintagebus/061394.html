Subject: Safari's-CE vs. Izzy's

I've been on the list for awhile now.  I remember for
a long time everyone said Izzy's Safari's were the
closest to original VW frames.  Now there seems to be
a following for frames built by CE.  I definetly plan
on installing Safari's on my double cab.  I unbolted
the front window frames because I really need that air
flow to stay cool in the hot Cali Summers.  This
winter I would like to purchase the kit and finally
instal, as I'm doing metalwork to my truck this
winter, and hope to have it perfect by next winter,
christmas 2003.  Which should I buy.  The price is
acceptable if it pays for quality.  Sorry to all those
tired of hearing this story.  I know I have seen it a
lot, but I just started hearing about CE and would
like to know.  Thanks of course.  This list is the
best bus idea yet.
