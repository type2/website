Subject: re:por-15 or 3M

was writ
&quot;Incidentally, the wheel wells were bared and sprayed with that professio=
nal
3M white gritty wheel well coating first then POR-ed, as I
wanted guaranteed adhesion and protection in the wheel wells, and it was
clear to me that the 3M product could stick to butter! THe POR adhered
excellently to the 3M product, giving me the best of both products - the
rock-resistant super-adhesion 3M stuff, and the waterproofing of the POR.=
&quot;

*********
what is this 3M product, i have never seen it or heard of it?
