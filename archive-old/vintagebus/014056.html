My arsenal consists of such diverse elements as

Fear 
Surprise
Sawzall
Air-powered reciprocating saw
tin snips
invectives in English, German, Spanish and Russian

We got the doors off last night, and then cut the roof off.  Anyone need
a roof?  It's in nice shape apart from the lichens!  Also have a decent
deluxe hatch, and deluxe rear window.

FWIW, the bus still runs at this point.  If the weather is good, I'm going
to take it for a drive  aroudn the block sans doors and roof...
