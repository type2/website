 paint work was apparently done while inebriated. Any suggestions on
 removing THICK paint from glass, hubcaps, etc.? &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
We have had good results with 3Ms Safest Stripper.  Not only does it seem to
remove all but VW factory paint, but it has no fumes to kill you or your brain
cells.  Try small areas on you bus or other repainted places for different
lengths of time (5,10,15,20 minutes.....) to see how long the stripper needs
to do it's dirty work thoughly.  The main thing that helps this product work
is to use it during cool weather and/or cover the stripper with plastic wrap
to prevent it from drying out before it has a chance to work.   Eric &amp; Barb
