&gt; i assume the weird convoluted hose is the actual cyclone filter, and it 
&gt; attaches to the larger-than-stock aircleaner? note that it clearly  goes below 
&gt; the apron tin.

Hi Craig,
Otay, the part the hand in the image is holding is the rubber piece that its 
bottom grommets into a hole in the floor of the engine compartment allowing 
dust to fall out.  The part just above the hand in the image is the cyclone 
filter and attaches to the early larger oil bath air cleaner.  So far after 15 
years of looking we have not come across a cyclone filter let alone the rubber 
bit below it for sale!
  We suggest you install the plain larger oil bath air cleaner and make sure 
to correct your carb jetting to match this change.
