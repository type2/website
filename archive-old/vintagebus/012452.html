Does anyone have access to doing searches of VIN numbers to see who a 
vehicle was last titled to and in what state? I've kinda run into a 
brick wall as far as the Florida DMV and the police are concerned. I 
called the local police and they couldnt come up with any info. Now if I 
put a tag on the vehicle and get stopped, I will get a ticket because it 
will come back as not registered...BUT...they cant tell me WHO it was 
last titled to. Its a shame that its easier to do it illegally than it 
is to do it properly !!
