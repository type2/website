&lt;&lt; I have a '64 bus with a single intake manifold.  This engine is kaput and 
I 
 was wondering what, if any, kind of hassles I will encounter with this 
 exchange.  I already have a new 1600 dual port to put into the bus.  Please 
 help...  I don't have a car and need to get it fixed ASAP.
  &gt;&gt;
it fits in and bolts up and attaches just the same.   this motor is complete? 
 if not you will need the DP manifold (3 pcs), either the DP carb or an 
adaptor so you can use your sp carb, and if the manifold has extra holes for 
say a brake booster they must be plugged.  the DP also takes differnt 
cylinder tin.
