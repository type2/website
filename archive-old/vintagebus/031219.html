Possible explanations: 
1) Too exhausted after driving all weekend
2) Still excited about the new bus and typing pretty fast
3) In spanish (my native language) bench is used both for long and short 
sitting structures, apparently this is not the case in English.
It is a walk trough, so I should have called it a stool, I guess.
Sorry,

&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt; =====
&gt;&gt; And now comes the weekend's highlight (for me): I checked out a one-owner 
'66
&gt;&gt; Westie that I had been after for some time. It was very complete 
(walk-through
&gt;&gt; bench, child's cot, tent, roof rack), and original (velvet green paint,
&gt;
&gt;''walk-through bench'' ??  How can that be?  Please explain.
