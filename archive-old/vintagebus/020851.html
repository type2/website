&gt; 
&gt; Hi Ric,
&gt; Best to run the 65 pounds pressure!

I disagree.  If you run that much pressure the centers of the tires wear prematurely.  I found this out by running 50PSI in my rear tires on 
my '71 when 37-40 was the recommendation.  The centerline tread was bald while the edge still had 3/16 or more tread depth.  This 
represents a major loss of tread life.  You will also feel every pebble and paint stripe on the road, which isn't good for the bus either.

&gt; The tires you are using were not really 
&gt; designed for VW bus use in mind and thusly the old fashioned VW pressure 
&gt; levels could result in tire seperation.

The old VW bias ply pressures do not apply, but the radial tire pressure specifications do.  The tire size is the same.  For splits, the 
pressures specified for early Bays are probably a bit high due to the lighter weight of the splits, but they will be much closer to the 
ballpark than the max pressure on the tire.

&gt;  Which is what Firestone is claiming 
&gt; about Fords recommended lower pressure cushier/softer riding tire pressure 
&gt; levels.

No, in the Ford/Firestone case, Ford's recommended pressures were ridiculously low, on the order of 25PSI.  VW's pressure specs for 
radial tires are much more realistic.  The cause of tread separation (way oversimplified) is excessive tread deflection.  The maximum 
pressure printed on the tire is sufficient to limit tread deflection at the maximum load specified on the tire.  D-rated tires will handle much 
more load than they will ever experience on a bus, so the pressure may be safely reduced without causing excessive deflection.

Tire manufacturers publish charts that specify the optimum pressure for various loads.  Savvy tire dealers will have these, but such dealers 
are few and far between.  You need to have the actual load on each tire to use these charts, since the load will be different for front and 
back tires.  I have a feeling that the tire manufacturers specs will be very close to VW's recommendations anyway.

&gt; Plus with higher pressure and stiffer tires you will have better 
&gt; handling, especially in cross winds and/or when a semi passes you will not 
&gt; automaticly change lanes inadvertantly!

I really haven't noticed any difference in handling with a 10PSI reduction in pressure.  The stiffness of the thicker sidewalls, not the 
pressure, is the stabilizing feature to the C- or D- range tires.
