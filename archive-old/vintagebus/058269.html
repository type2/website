&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; I checked the net and some other sources and am looking at about $200,
 with my core, before tax and shipping.

 &gt; Yup, they're pretty much the only game in town.  Bend over and squeal like
 a pig, boy!
 &gt; $200 bones is a LOT for ~$5 of new bushings, but you gotta grab the K-Y
 unless you can
 &gt; do it yourself.
 
 Are the bushings the only thing that wears out? If so, how hard is it to get
 the bushings? I have a press I can use to install new bushings.

cool!- maybe you can start rebuilding them for less than 200 bones then!
