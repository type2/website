Gabe-

Our '65 Deluxe would cost a fortune to perfectly restore! We plan to do it 
someday, but we want to have fun in it NOW, so we took out the original 
panels and made some from masonite (peg board without the holes) and put 
some quilt batting (for padding) and tye-dye fabric on them with hotmelt 
glue and some 3M interior adhesive. Psycho-delic!

The seat covers are going to be some cheapos from a department store with 
some tye-dye sewn onto them.

The rubber? I say wait until you can buy the good stuff. You'll not want to 
do it twice. We do what we can with what we have depending on what is needed 
first. 1- It's a vehicle, make it go. 2- It's your *ss, so make it stop, 
too. 3- Make it comfortable 4- Make it pretty.

Make it pretty is last. You're still cooler at a VW run in your ugly bus 
than you are in someone elses car when your freshly painted body needs a 
motor!!! I have only 25% of the Deluxe trim, 50% of the original 
interior...I'm just glad the body is so cherry. New floors are going in 
because this is our 2nd Bus. The first Bus, our driver, gets what he needs 
to stay alive and that's it for now.

Have some fun with it!!
