snip!


THere was one on ebay that went for $60-something.  I paid $5 for mine,
including the knob!

Just gotta keep an eye out at the swaps and on ebay I guess...

seems like everything on ebay is like 10 times the price it would go for at a
swap meet..buyer beware i guess..

wasn't there some thread a while ago about how the steel shifter extensions
cause undue wear und tear on the shifter cones er sumthing??
