&lt;&lt; What is supposed to go between the heat exchanger and the cherry bomb 
silencer thing on the heat tube?&gt;&gt;
A steel zinc coated flex tubing.  

&lt;&lt; My truck came with no engine, just sand filled silencers. I had to remove 
the silencers and gut them, cuz there's no way I wanted that s**t blowing 
into the cab. Is the felt packing available?&gt;&gt;
As far as we have been able to figure it is fiberglass cloth.

&lt;&lt;Has there ever been a replacement asbestos jacket made for the heat tube? &gt;&gt;
There again, defintely fiber glass cloth.  Buses after 1960, or so had a 
vinyl coat sewn over the tubes, and fiber glass cloth.  The type of fiber 
glass cloth you can pick up at any respectible hardware store from the 
fiberglass repair section.  This is very handy also to beef up the amount of 
this material inside of new bus tail dampeners  which come with almost none 
to save the manufacture $, and you more noise.
