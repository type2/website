Subject: Single Cab Headliner
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

All--
Recently I ordered a headliner for my 1967 single cab from Calif. Imports 
(their #T20-2107-44) for 1965-74 single cabs.  My understanding is that my 
headliner should be cardboard (fiberboard?) like the kick panels.  What came 
is a vinyl, perforated headliner that looks like half a beetle's headliner.  
And it's one rectangular piece, with no provision for the roof vent.

What gives?  Is this completely wrong?  Does it have to be cut?  Does it 
cover the cardboard headliner?  What?  I do have the parts book, and it shows 
two separate pieces for the headliner.--David
