Hi C,
The problem with thin walled cylinders is the cylinder does not spead the 
heat evenly due to being too thin.  So the top gets really cool and the 
bottom of each cylinder gets even hotter.  Kind of like frying an egg in a 
thicker walled cast iron pan instead of a thin skinned stainless steel pan.  
The stainless pan is alot easier to get hot and cold spots across the bottom 
cooking surface.  In the cylinders this results in areas where hot spots 
occur easier and spread slightly. While the colder areas of the cylinder wall 
stay contracted.  Resulting in cylinders that do not stay very round and 
warping.
   When Eric was ill for a while we bought the 1641 SP engine we are now 
running in our 1960 panel camper.  The shop that did up this engine for us 
(Bear's Machine Shop in San Diego, CA) put in the thin walled 1641cc 
cylinders without telling us.  They are good friends of ours and figured we 
needed a little more HP for our bus!  When the engine was delievered to us 
and we found out it had thin walled cylinders we were a bit nervous, but 
figured since they were in there we would run them.  If they went bad we 
could easily install a set of stocker 1600 P&amp;Cs.  Now over 55,000 miles later 
we have had no problems though this probably is due to us liking to baby our 
engines by cruising at 3,000 RPM or a little less and never pushing the oil 
temp over 210F. 
  We forgot to mention in the last Email to the list that this engine is 
running a stock crank with welded counter wieghts.  Makes it alot quiter, 
smoother and seems to convert that stocker shaking, vibrating, loud engine 
rumbling noise into more HP to the wheels.  Which makes sense.  Try going 
around your home all one day screaming on the top of your lungs.  It will 
really tire you out due to all that energy you are expending just to make 
noise.  Next engine we are going to build we are going to have another CW 
crank and have the pulley, FW, and pressure plate balanced together.
