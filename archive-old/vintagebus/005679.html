Subject: westy trim parts

Does anyone know where one can purchase the plastic &quot;T&quot; trim that covers the
edge of the plywood cabinets in a Westy?  I am also in need of the trim that
trims out the edge of the cabinets where they meet the busses sides (looks
like a &quot;bulb&quot; type weather stripping).
