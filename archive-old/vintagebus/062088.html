Subject: M216 and tranny ratio ramblings

First off does anyone have a spare small nut 1.26 ratio RGB (M216) setup
from a '63 sitting around they do not need anymore?  If so I need it, please
:)

Okay I have been on the phone and searching the archives on this &quot;freeway
flier&quot; stuff... It is quite a chore to make a good one with all the right
parts.  Hopefully I can do some creative junkyarding and source some parts.
New gears are pricey!

Also as a side note I do not think it would be a good idea to run a stock
1600 with a freeway flier.  After doing the math, it is a lot to pull that
kind of gears.  I have seen it done, but never driven one.

First off I am starting in the hole with small nut RGBs with 1.39 ratio.
(help. please. see above M216)  It is a lot of gearing to overcome just to
get back where the later 1.26 ratio starts, in my case 5 MPH difference with
27.7 diameter tires. I could ramble on, but here is a formula that works for
me:

1st = stock
2nd = stock
3rd = 1.217 (113 style 1.21 early Type II - need to modify the pinion shaft)
4th = .82 (from a bay 002 tranny)   
RGB = 1.38 (some say 1.38 others 1.39)
R&amp;P = 3.875
Not sure what housing I need to use, but that should not be hard once I see
everything...

All this equals about 65 MPH at 3500 RPM.

If you want good juicy details look up Todd Hill in the archives.

Also factor in a tranny rebuild kit (about $100) and then two small nut RGB
rebuild kits (about $88 each at Bus Boys, only price I could find on the
net).  Plus the 944 rear brakes and master cylinder($125 new), not sure the
impact here.  Possibly the cost of M216 RGBs if someone has a set FS.  Plus
the necessary gears from who knows where.

I might just buy a pre-made tranny to these specs from a known local guy who
does a great job.  But I need to talk to him first as to cost, I figure I
can do it myself for 200-250 + PITA factor (just tranny).

...  Oh wait now the motor need to grow to push the bus up a hill due to the
high gearing!... Another big project.  Anyone have a WBX 2.1 76.4mm crank
laying around they want to part with?  FWIW the CIS FI part is coming along
underbudget so far :)

Then I need tires, Bilstein shocks, trailer hitch and camber compensator...
Then comes the body work and paint :(

Overall a complete waste of time and money... Shear stupidity keeps me
moving ahead...  Totally unexplainable and unjustifiable.
