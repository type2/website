Subject: Westy For Sale 1965

   I have a pretty straight rust free westy for sale. It appears to need a
rocker and that's it as far as body. The front floor has hacked panels
installed which should be removed and replaced with real replacement pieces
but will work as is. It's a non walkthrough, interiors complete, even the
ice box. Bus is being sold as/is the same as I recieved it. I bought this
bus to help my transport friend fill his trailer and to get another nice
camper out to the west. This bus has been stored indoors, thus the
condition. I'm surprized that someone back east didn't grab this bus up.
It's straighter then a lot of POS I seeout here.  The bus will be at Pomona
in the for sale area, you can find me in row 34 space 27.

if it would have been a bullet I would keep it
