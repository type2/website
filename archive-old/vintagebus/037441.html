this makes me wonder-   some of the buses surely have the same birthday.  
some might even have the same birthday.   There may be twins out there.  
Franternal, and identical.     We could hav an astrology things.  If your bus 
was produced on this day......

There are about 500 VB listees, some of which are busless, but 
a lot of us have more than one bus.

So you'd have to collect data from 500 people, organize it, validate
it, and enter it into whatever s/w they use for calendar making.

About that time, the Lagwagen Crowd would start feeling left out, so
you'd have to do them, too.  There's about twice as many of them as
the are VB'ers.

Thank you SO much for volunteering to take on this task!  I'm sure
you'll find it a rewarding experience :)
