Subject: unrestored buses + $$$

there are a couple of crowds that look for unrestored original buses and 
leave them that way......

I know a bunch of other guys that do that with 50s American cars........

My 67 EMPI  GTV  Bug  is cool old paint with the lacquer clear coat turned 
white and flaking off.....

as the sign said &quot;barn fresh&quot;

Sometimes &quot;over restored&quot; is just not a practical ride.......
but $19,000 for a un restored Samba seems crazy..........
