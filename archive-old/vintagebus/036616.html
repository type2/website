well, why do you think it came from the clutch area?  maybe the front clutch did not come with a circlip, so it is kind of hard to tell from here where it goes.  Then again I have seen the linkages up there put back together in a non stock way. more than once.  and they worked. let us know what you find . has anything actually come apart, or did you just find a circlip under your bus?  perhaps glued to the undercarriage with old grease.  what size?  why the clutch and not the accelerator or whatever ?
