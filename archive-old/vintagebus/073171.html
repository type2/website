Subject: Re: [VB] '65 Wiper Motor

It does have the original motor in it. I changed the armature because I am running 12 volts and as far as I kjnow you are right, it's a one year only motor. It does have three wires going  to it, brown black/purple and black.  I looked in the Bentley and it appears to be the same diagrams that are on Vintagebus. I'm also wondering if I installed the armature incorrectly and it's binding up in there. I 'll pull it tonight and see but I wanted to make sure the wiring is right too. After installing a new trans this weekend and driving to San Diego to pick the trans up, it would have been nice not to have to fiddle with this too!!! 
 
Thanks,
