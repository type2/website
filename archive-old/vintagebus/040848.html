Importance: Normal

Along with a bunch of youse, I went to the local
Wally's to find VW's.  No Deluxe with trailer,
but found the VeeDubs set of 5.  The Road&amp;Track
series is a Walmart exclusive, and the 'designers'
play really loose on the accuracy.  It's fun.

The set includes a VW Champer, Left side cargo doors,
longer than normal right side windows, a pop-top of
a variety I have never seen.  A RHD Golf, a 1300
Beetle with late model lights.  Oh yeah, check the
underside of the bus.  This is a real hack bus, 
front engine, 4WD, muffler under the driver, and 
tailpipe out the back.  The side doors have hinges
on the top &amp; bottom, not even on the sides.

But WTH, they're still cool.
