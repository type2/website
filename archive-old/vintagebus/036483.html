Dear List,
I'm sure this is all very fascinating to someone, but it's not me.....
I have a question that actually pertains to the subject of the
list...vintage busses.
Now that I know that Glasurit paint is what I need for my bus, where can
I buy it, and how much would I need for a complete re-paint....sea blue
below, and cumulus white above?  
Thanks much,
Susan
