Subject: questions: 1 carb 1 brake

sent these to a vendor, but thought i'd kick 'em to the entire list for
fun......


My neighbor brought over some brake drums for his bus... they are Mexican,
and are BLUE! Has anyone seen these/tried these/sold these? Any quality
issues?


On those 'repro' 30-pict-1 carbs( NOT the 30/31), they are non-choke
models, BUT is there ANY reason why I couldn't just slap on the electric
choke TOP from my current 30Pict1 carb?


oh yeah, anyone have a vacuum advance dizzy, new or rebuilt? something
along the lines of the 205?
