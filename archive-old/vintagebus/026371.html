hey guys, i've got some pics up of my progress on the 63, and some more
pics of Stella up..more current..as of yesterday anyways :)
some of the pictures suck due to the sun, but you get the general idea.
Its sitting in my garage aka the black hole. You'll know what I mean
once you see the pictures.

I only need rear hatch glass and I'll have a complete bus! well..that
and a wiring harness and seals.  That is soon to come, and the paint is
almost done too 8-)  The 63 will be done come summer time...just in time
for camping!

lemme know what you think

it takes a bit to load...but not too bad
