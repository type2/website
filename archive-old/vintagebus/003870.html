Hey Everyone, I just posted some pics of the mirrors on Everett's (and
Thom's) site. Does anyone know about these? I can't find them in my parts
book. Are they for a Splittie? I have a set that I got from Germany. Mine
also came with a mounting kit. I think that maybe the kit is for a bay
window bus. The mounts look like they would attach to the beltline, and the
beltline continues around the front on a bay.
Someone is selling a bunch on ebay, and they are not cheap!
