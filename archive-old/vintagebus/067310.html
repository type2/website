Subject: Weekend salvage yard experience

Howdy.

Saturday my son and I trekked off to Austin Vee Dub looking for Bus parts,
and boy did we find some.  It was a perfect day for crawling all over old
buses, beetles and every VW model imaginable, cold(37degrees) and rainy, but
just Jake(whose just turned 7)and I were there, having free run over the
field of old VW's and the ghost stories that went with each one.  They must
have had 12 pre-'67 splitties and the same amount of Bays.  My mission was
to find a spare tire hold down bracket for my non-walk thru '66, which we
did, a driver's visor bracket, check, the tiny set screws for the wiper arm,
check and a rear engine cover lid-no rust and straight, check.  The only one
we failed on was the aluminum elbow that mounts on the middle seat for the
passenger grab bar.  That one may be a tough one to find.  Is just me or is
it just sad to see all those Buses just wasting away out in the yard.  While
some were well on there way to going back to where they came from, some
looked as if all they needed was a caring owner and they'd be back on the
road in no time at all.  All in all it was a great day of poking around old
buses looking and wondering and listening to the echoes of their old owners.

Thanks for letting me pipe on about a fun day.
