Hello list, funny that this came up, I just weighed my crew cab this
weekend. 2240lbs with a half tank of gas. My truck has aluminum wheels, and
there is no division between the front and rear seat; I'm sure that lightens
it up some. It is an IRS car conversion, do you guys think this set-up is
lighter or heavier than stock? Everett's site has the weights of all the
different models. It is written on one of the scanned papers somewhere under
type II. Later!

&gt;
&gt; Depends on the bus (i.e., how many windows, what interior, all that
&gt; rot).  I've seen figures anywhere from 1,100 to 1,300 kilograms, which
&gt; roughly translates to 2400-2800 pounds.  The most common value I've
&gt; seen is 1,150 kilograms (minimal number of windows for a non-panel, no
&gt; seats in the back).  Look for numbers resembling the kilogram values
&gt; I've given here on the id plate.  Can't remember what suffix they use,
&gt; but it's probably Kg.
