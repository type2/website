Anybody drive on whitewalls everyday?In slush? I would like to swap the 
radials for whitewalls and I don't know anybody that has them for a test 
spin. I drive fairly regularly but not every single day so I can skip the 
real bad weather. Any suggestions for brands? Any used ones out there for 
sale? Thanks.
