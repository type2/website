&lt;&lt;In RMM (yes, I like the catalog) I see that there are two panels that
cover this area originally.  Does this mean that the &quot;tire-bulge&quot; is left
uncovered and just painted pearl white?&gt;&gt;

To my knowledge, no one is making a divider panel for a bench seat bus...
The two panels you see in the RMM catalog are for a walk through bus. Your
bus originally had one long pannel that covered the whole bulkhead. I'm sure
these can easily be made with some carboard or wood panneling of some sort.
Hope this helps
