FWIW, WetWesties has a resident Eberspacher gas heater expert.  Robert
Keezer (sp?) runs Warmerwagen in the Seattle area.  AFAIK everyone who
has done business with him has come away happy. Robert can be reached
at: &lt;mailto:warmerwagen_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Another listmember, Vern McIntosh is the resident S-W/Southwind
expert. Vern has driven Corvairs exclusively until just recently (he
finally bought an '82 a/c Westy) and has extensive experience with the
S-W heaters that were stock the the GM product. P-mail me and I'll
forward questions to him. (He does not do heaters as a business.  Just
knows them!)
