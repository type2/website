Subject: speedo specs

Does anyone have pictures of the inside of 65 bus speedo. On our trip
just before we got back to dallas the speedo started howling and
flipping around and then quit. The odometer still works so it must be in
the speedo. Also does anyone know if there are any kind of aftermarket
speedos. Maybe something with combined guages to keep track of things.
Right now I have my guages mounted in the package tray so I wouldn't
have to cut holes in the dash, but they are not very visible.
