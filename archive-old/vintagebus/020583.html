Saw what looked like a restored-a-long-time-ago or an unrestored
'61-or-earlier 23 window in Aberdeen last night.  Parked on the side of
the street.  Looks like an original roof rack on top.  Red and white. 
Take-off-the-overriders-to-make-it-look European bumpers.  Body looked
fairly straight.

What a great sight!  Turning around a corner and seeing those lovely
little glass taillights.  Made me ashamed to be driving the Subaru at the
time.

A listee?
