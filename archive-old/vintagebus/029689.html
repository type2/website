A little story about lube joints.  Had Econo Lube &amp; Tune change the oil on my
T*yota truck for years when I didn't have time to do it myself.  Never had a
problem, but I watched them like a hawk.  One time, in a moment of weakness, I
decided to let them change the gear oil in my manual tranny.  Ok they did it
and all seemed fine, until I got home and noticed a spot under the tranny.
The side drain plug was leaking.  The next time I was driving by I stopped in
.  Told them it was leaking and walked away to get a soda.  Big mistake!  I
walked back to see my truck rocking violently back and forth.  I looked under
into the pit and saw some kid literally jumping up and down while handing onto
a 3 ft breaker bar trying to tighten the side drain plug!!  Of course it
cracked the case.  Took me months of fighting for them to agree to get it
fixed.  Why was it leaking in the first place?  The &quot;experienced&quot; technician
didn't put the copper washer back in when he reinstalled the drain plug.

My advice is to watch them every second.
