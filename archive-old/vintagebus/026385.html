Steve:
It's been a couple years since my wife rebuilt my PICT30 but I seem to
remember her having to remove the choke plate and rod to remove that
piece.  It's a pull off as I recall that opens the choke ever so
slightly when vacuum is applied (from inside the carb body) so that your
engine gets some air with all that raw fuel.  Can't wait until she
tackles the WEBER 32/35 DFAV.  I saw a post on that carb a  couple days
ago.
