You really should replace all 4 of the bearings.  If you're between
a rock and a hard place, like it seems you are, you can replace the
one, but the other bearing which is weak will take out the new good one
before too long if you don't replace it.

&gt; bearing...and thats the later style bearing.
&gt; Is this part even a bearing?  I see big round balls in it...but i
&gt; haven't taken the backing plate or anything like that off yet.
&gt; Does anyone have a spare bearing they'd be willing to send...asap?!  or
&gt; tell me where i can get one.  I need this bus rolling saturday for the
&gt; event(s).
