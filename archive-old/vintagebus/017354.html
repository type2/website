Subject: Is correct year/color important?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi folks.

Just bought a 67 deluxe 21-window in a lovely shade of
tar black with a nifty red beltline and nose. 
I have 2 options:
1) Get the vanity plate &quot;DARTHVW&quot;
or
2) Paint it. 

Obviosly, option 2 is the desireable choice. Now comes
my question(s). The original paint was sea blue/white.
 My favorite old bus color is Sealing Wax Red/Beige
grey. They didin't offer this combo after 64 or 65. In
67 the red was Titan Red with white.

Does anyone have PICTURES of actual busses with Titan
red/white paint? The Wolfsburg West chart is tough to
go by. Also, was it a metallic red?

Then, if I go the Sealing wax red/ Beige grey route,
would that make my bus less desireable? Since that's 
not a stock color for 67 (either way, I'll do the
proper interior color for the exterior choice)

So, is &quot;original color paint&quot; better then
&quot;non-original color from same year&quot; better then &quot;stock
bus color from earlier year&quot;

Or, do most people really care, so long as it's not
tar black with a nifty red belt line.

I will be sinking considerable $$ into a full
back-to-stock resto (except for engine/suspension to
be more safe&amp;reliable (see &quot;Jerome&quot;). And if I ever
sell it, it would be nice to know I could get
some/most of that back.
BUT...since I'm doing the 1600cc or better engine, is
the non-stock color going to be a moot point (i.e. bus
OEM status already altered, done deal)

Experiences and case studies appreciated.
