Subject: early gas tank divider panel

Hi All,

To my disappointment yesterday, I received a pair of early 60's gas tank
divider panels... not correct for the 59 double cab.  One's thrashed on the
bottom and one has a hole cut in it possibly for a gas heater vent.  The one
with the hole isn't too bad.  Anyway, they're the newer ones.  I repeatedly
asked the guy on the phone if they were symmetrical top to bottom and he
said 'yes'.... well, obviously the word 'symmetrical' didn't register
correctly.  So, I'm still searching and now I have two plates that aren't
too good and have no use... anyone need some?  I may have to go down and
plead with my autobody friend to see if he can resurrect my original one....
I did find a pair of early plates and the guy was semi willing to part with
them until I found out he was pulling them from his running '59 double cab
and I backed down from the deal... no need to ruin authenticity of someone
else's ride just for mine.  If anyone has one divider plate, please let me
know.  Cash or trade for other items.

... and i'm still searching for some divider plate felt strips.  I did get a
few nice pieces from the two plates I just received so the whole thing
didn't go all bad.

I've got a picture of what I need on my site of the correct plate:
