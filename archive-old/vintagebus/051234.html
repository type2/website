&gt; From: Everett Barnes &lt;everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wonder if Steve Harris is behind the taskbar thing.  I think he's a
&gt; camera man for Access Hollywood.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I thought it was another show but I've been meaning to ask him...
&gt; 
&gt; Someone told me this a few months ago but I have never seen it, ;(
Not been posting for a few months due to a move...but I've been reading
from work.

Two bus related Access Hollywood mentions in less than a week...ha ha ha ha
ha :-0

I wish I could say I had a hand in getting split busses on network TV, but
alas it twas not me.  I did'nt even shoot the Britiney commercial
stuff...one of the freelance guys did.  They did'nt even tell me about it. 
I'll check with our graphics guy and check out a show copy and see whats
up.   

There is one other split bus that drives to NBC Burbank, so he might work
in graphics.  It is a 66? white over light blue kombi with no sides
windows....brrrrrr.
Anyone??  

Steve
