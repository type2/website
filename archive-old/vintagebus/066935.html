&gt;Can anyone help id the mc so I know what to order?

I am by no means a parts expert but it seems like most of the VW
master cylinders I have seen have the reservoir input centerline
at 90 degrees to the centerline of the flange bolts.  Yours looks
more like 45 degrees.  Also, I seem to recall that there was an
ATE part number stamped somewhere on the German ATE master cylinder
I put on my '64 - perhaps an ATE dealer would have a rebuild kit
listing.

You mentioned flushing out the line and if that was successful then
this may not apply, but: It seems like there would be several rubber
hose sections in this hydraulic system.  Have you verified that all
these are good?  A test might be to take a spare wheel cylinder and
a short piece of brake line and hook it up directly to the master
cylinder.  Put a C-clamp on the wheel cylinder pistons so they can
move a bit but not fall out.  Then try to bleed this small system.
If you can get pressure doing this, then the MC is probably OK and
the lines and hoses are suspect.

Have you checked with http://www.ruthmann_dot_de/ (caution: much Flash)
for a parts or service manual?  I looked around their site and they
have a used for-sale page (Gebrauchte -&gt; Steiger) - the first vehicle
listed is a 1986 VW-Pritsche with a V80 installed, so they may still
support that model.  On the other hand, if German insurance companies
are like American ones, they may not offer service materials to the
end-user.
