&lt;&lt; I found a swingaxle kit for my bus that was inexpensive. I had been 
considering
 putting in a freeway flyer tranny, but I met someone who was raving about 
how much better his bus handled on the freeway since he lowered it.&gt;&gt;

Hi John,
If you lower the rear you must lower the front or look/feel rediculous and 
have slight steering problems because you are riding on more of the rear of 
the steering tires.  While lowing the bus would help handling we have found 
at least equal handling improvments by installing stiffer shocks and proper 
wieght range tires.  Lowering the bus most likely means using smaller tires 
that are much below the stock 1530Lbs. wieght range.  Also if you are talking 
about using the type 3 axles the brakes are less powerfull than the 1955-67 
ones and we have seen lowered type 3 rear drums crack due to changing thier 
geometery in relation to the pavement on the much lighter type 3!

&lt;&lt; I would like a little better speed on the freeway without winding out the 
motor, but I have heard stories about bad gas mileage with the freeway flyer. 
 &gt;&gt;
Our 63 SC with big bore 40HP SP SR engine we are getting about 23MPG average 
with a mixture of in townb and highway driving.  Our 60 panel camper 
conversion with 1641 SP DR and CW crankshaft engine gets about 22-23 MPG 
normally and on our 1400+ mile trips to Sacramento from the Seattle and back, 
we get a 25MPG average.  Both of these type 2s have 3.875R&amp;P and .82 fourth 
gear.    Eric&amp;Barb
