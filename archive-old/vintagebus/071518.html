Subject: I finally did it... I bought one.  Trip report.

Volk-a-maniacs,

Puyallup was a success for us.  First, in the swap area, we found a 'like new'
headlight switch for the father-in-law's '67 (cheap).  Then, after wiping up
the drool from the show area, we headed out to the parking lot for the 'real'
car show.  I was strolling around and there it was.  '63 camper bus (Samba?)
with a for sale sign.  $1700 or best offer.  My best offer turned out to be
less than $1700.  Now... to get it back to Oregon.  Hmm.  Will it make the
~150 mile trip?

Trip report part of the story............
Well... the answer is no.  It turns out that the poor old bus hadn't had a
tune up for a while and the PO hadn't driven it on the Highway very much.
Then, like an abusive owner, I get into it and push the pedal to the floor for
almost 100 miles... not good.  Right across the river from Trojan Nuclear
Power Plant (coincidence?), chug chug backfire and stop.  What the hell?
After some poking around we find that lack of care the PO put the engine
through and call it too dangerous to hang out on the roadside.  Gotta get out
of here before we get mashed by one of the passing trucks.  A quick run (with
the follower vehicle) into a nearby town to get a tow rope and back to rescue
my new (to me) bus.  A couple miles of towing on the shoulder and we get her
off the road and next to a gas station for some more poking around.  With the
light fading and nothing being open at the late hour of 8pm, we scrape the
blackness off of the distributor cap, the sparkplugs, the points are checked,
we dump gas into the carb... and nothing but sputter and a lot of smoke.  Not
looking good.  Now creeping up on 11pm and the SO's at home are getting
anxious to see us home.  Still poking around on the engine and we decide to
give it one last try... VROOOMMM.  Smokey, choking, nasty, mess but we pulled
it into a safer spot to sit for the night.  Now to drive that extra hour home
in the car.

Next morning, up at 6 and headed back up to Washington with some replacement
parts.  We get there and start her up, still smokey and nasty.  No point in
pushing it any further.  Off to UHaul to get a towbar.  Damn those are
expensive.  I only had it for about 3 hours for cripes sakes.  Ouch.  Now we
are approaching that $1700 original asking price... not so much of a deal any
more... especially if the engine is toast.  We drag the old girl home and park
it at around noon.  I've already skipped a full day's worth of work now and
have to get back and deal with things.  Reconvene that evening.  Father-in-law
to come back later that day to help me comb through he engine with a full tune
up.  I get back from work and we replace the cap, rotor, points, plugs and
cables.  A few other adjustments and she fires up and purrs.  Not sure what
that smoke was back in Washington, but now she runs pretty well after a good
warm up.

Now comes the work to fix all the damage the PO has done.  Good kid, but
didn't know much in the way of maintenance or care.  Not that I am much
better, but I at least know enough to get myself in trouble.

Here are some pictures.  Let me know what you think.  She needs a lot of work,
but how would it be fun otherwise?
