Subject: '59 Kombi gas mileage

I did the numbers on my '59 Kombi and figured out how bad the 
speedometer and odometer are off. I used my works '99 Plym**th 
V*y*g*r with the digital miles to compare. It turns out when my 
speedo says 50, I'm really going 45mph. And when my odometer says 
I've gon 11 miles, it's really only been 10. I knew this pretty much, 
but never had the actual numbers.

When I plugged the numbers from my last fill-up into the calculator 
it showed that my bus gets 22 miles to the gallon right now. Not too 
bad really. 1600DP engine, 34-PICT carb, stock but muffler, oil bath 
aircleaner, regular unleaded gas.

Of course I didn't factor in the &quot;pump theft&quot; factor. A lot of the 
gas stations actually rip you off on gas. One time when I ran out, I 
put about 1 gallon in and drove to the nearest station about 1 or 2 
miles away. I filled up the tank and their pump showed that I put in 
almost 11 gallons. Yeh...right.
