Subject: Audio wiring gurus please chime in

Willpower.. fading.... EFile return.. burning..hole...in...pocket.

I'd been wanting to do this in my bus, but you guys talked me out of it
(since headlights are good, and so's being able to restart...) But I'm still
obsessed:

Need cheap, but insanely satisfying home theatre surround setup. Want to
splice 2(4?) sets of Klipsch Promedia 5.1's and somehow jammem in the back
of my TV. Believe TV has 5.1 analog out, know DVD has it. How to make it go?
FNdunno; but 10-20 sats, 2-4 subs, and 1000-2000W for $500-1000(online)
sounds schweet. Especially since they're powered and I shouldn't hafta buy a
buy stupid expensive AV amp, right? I know I will be replacing the standard
wiring with HQ lines and interconnects. There's just the issue of going from
miniplug to RCA, and all the associated splitters...

Then I can go get stupid, sit in the middle of the room, and play those Wall
of Sound era 'boards'...[insert Homer drool sound}....

Can someone please help make this sick little fantasy go, please?

TIA,

jt
