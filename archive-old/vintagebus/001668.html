Don't knock those 8-track players.  My '79 Beetle Convertible has an in-dash
AM/FM 8-track player.  It came in the car new.  It works great.  There's
nothing like sitting around at a VW event and listening to the original
motion picture soundtrack from &quot;Saturday Night Fever!&quot;

&gt;&gt; dont sell it!!!!! install it in your bus under the package tray and
&gt;astound
&gt;&gt; people.  you can gets lots of 8 tracks for it too.  they are 69 cents
each
&gt;at
&gt;&gt; the loacal Oly, WA Goodwill
&gt;
&gt;... it's strange that I stumbled into this thread tonight.
&gt;Yesterday my wife and I bought an older ('79 in awesome shape) 29 foot
&gt;Winnebao RV.  One of the things I saw in it when I was taking it for a test
&gt;excursion was an in-dash 8-track player.  The amazing thing is that it
still
&gt;works (the soon to be PO had a tape with him) !!!
&gt;
&gt;I guess our first trip from Florida will be to the Oly, WA Goodwill.    Can
&gt;you get them  to put a hold on them for me, pls??  On second thought maybe
&gt;they can transfer them to the Lakeland, FL store.  See what you can work
&gt;out.
