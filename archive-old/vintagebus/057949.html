Okay,
I posted this before, but now it really must go.
I have a roof from my '68 westy. Early smoothie style, with rack. No Seal.
Canvas could be better, but I've seen
worse.

This roof currently resides beside my house, but it must go ASAP. If anyone
wants it, please take it. If it's not
gone by Saturday, it will be taken to the dump, and I don't want to see that
happen. 

Please pmail me at adoom_at_rogers_dot_com for directions, or further questions. If I
know it will be definately be
taken I may be able to squeeze some more time. 

Thanks,
Adam
