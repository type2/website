Hi Taylor,

Recently an old technique has surfaced to at least identify your transaxle.
It basically is to:

  1:  Jack up one rear wheel (like you are changing a tire).
  2:  Mark the tire that you jacked up on a spot you can track.  I used tape
on it.
  3:  Put the engine in 4th gear.
  4:  Turn the crank pulley (the large one on the bottom) of the engine
until you have turned the jacked up wheel exactly three times.  Write down
the number of times you rotated the crank.  Try to get it to the nearest
1/8th of a crank turn.

It will take anywhere from 3 to 7 turns of your crank to do this in 4th.
You then do some math on that number and you can come up with something to
match against this table

If you want to do this, e-mail me your number of turns and then I'll help
you with the calculation.

OK, then there are a couple of other issues:

  --- Is your speedo correct?  Most are off because of tire changes or just
not accurate.  Most are optimistic (say you are going faster than you are).
  --- What size tires do you have?  The 1964-1967 bus had pretty small 14
inch tires.  I believe that 185R14 (metric) is the correct size.  If you
have larger, than you are actually lowering you RPM.

Remember, that is a tiny little engine pushing that big non-aerodynamic bus
:)

Well, I've seriously tried to follow the whole gear ratio thread to see if
I can glean what the 1500 engine and '67 tranny in my 63 camper is turning
when I'm between 60 and 65mph.  No joy...this is why I'm an english major!
:D  On the freeway I really don't take it much over 60...sounds like it's
running too high at 65.  Can anyone give me some numbers?
