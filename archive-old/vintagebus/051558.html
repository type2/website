Subject: RE: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

When you had the heads rebuilt did they replace the guides. I have found
that sometimes one of the problems causing the valves to loosen quickly are
worn guides, changing the valve adjustment constantly. Another problem I
have found are worn out valve adjusting screws. You adjust all properly only
to have them loosen imediatly after running the engine. Just a couple more
ideas.

Subject: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine


The valves or really noisy on my new rebuild. Still in the break in phase
with less that 200 miles on it. I adjusted the valves today and most were
about .010&quot;. Only one required no adjustment. It seems to me that as the
valves seat, the adjustment would get tight not loose. Is my thinking wrong
here?

Anyway, after the adjustment the noise seemed slightly worse. Being
paranoid, I got out my St. Muir engine noise tape, and sure enough, it
sounds exactly like the &quot;loose valve&quot; engine. It appears to be on the left
side of the engine.

I'll wait till I have another morning free and go through the valve
adjustment again, but I am hardly a novice at this procedure.

Any input?
