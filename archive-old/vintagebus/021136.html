Subject: Just my point of view.

Hi Real Bus People   Does anyone remember that old
song.....Where this guy has been hit hard and he picks
himself up off the floor and turns to walk to the bar
door.The people that hurt him think he is going to run
away and hide.So they start to laugh at him.....But
then there is dead silence as he closes that door and
bolts it tight.. so no one can get out......We have
seen them hit us.... we have seen them laugh at
us....What do you want to happen next? I gave my
blood.... I gave my money...That is not enough.I gave
4 years of my life from 72 to 76 in the Navy.... some
of that off the coast of Vietnam.Don't be fooled...we
were still taking it to them in 1972-4 even if the
word to the world was it was over.I am ready to go
back in,Whatever it takes.....FREEDOM is not
free.....The Red in OUR Flag represents the blood that
was spilled for us all to be free by those that came
before us.....The taking of life is a very...very sad
thing to do but those that cause evil must die so that
good may live.The loss of our way of life...in my
opinion would be the end of the world that I would
want to live in..... Put me down in the books with
those that stand with the United States of America...
not perfect at all times but it is the beacon of
freedom to the world.....as is.If we fall the rest of
the world is lost to evil.                On a lighter
note....I think the ABC AZ campout and bus giveaway
(.50 cents..sure that's for real..hahahaha..just
kidding folks) should go on as they want.It's their
deal do what they want.Now if it was my bus to raffle
off I would be selling tickets from Alaska to Hawaii
and all point east to west...send your money to a
company who has the pink slip and picks the winner for
us....But hey...that's me.What the hell do I know? And
now let's get back to bus stuff and let America kick
some _at_SS.....
