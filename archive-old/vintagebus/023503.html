pdesign_at_piasanet_dot_com made some snipped comments below: 

&lt;&lt;...the assembler said it would have been easier to put in the 
    .89 fourth. (instead of the Type II .82 4th onto a 3.875 pinion) &gt;&gt;

OK, how so?  Thats BS from someone attempting to pull a fast
one on an unsuspecting customer.  The .89 Type Is and the .82
Type IIs have the same internal splines and press on the pinion
shaft the same way.  Now, the 113 style 1.21 early Type II 3rds 
and the 1.26 Type I 3rds are slightly different on those internal
splines than the 002 style 1.26 3rds that came with the 3.875
pinion shafts.  But all that is required is about 2 minutes with 
a stationary belt sander to modify the ends of the 3rd gear
splines on the 3.875 pinion shaft  to allow the earlier 3rds to slip 
right on.

&lt;&lt;..Final Drive : 5.14 ( 3.88 R&amp;P + 1.26 reduction ) &gt;&gt;

Don't forget that the final drive ratio is going to be the ring and
pinion X the reduction gear ratio X whatever gear you're using.
In this case the final is 3.875 X 1.26 X .82 = 4.00365.

&lt;&lt;..With the first option, the gearing would be worse than a 
stock '64-'67 Bus assembly....&gt;&gt;

Actually, I get a final drive of 4.125 X .1.26 X .82 = 4.26 for
a '64-'67 Type II transaxle and a final of 3.875 X 1.26 X .89
= 4.34 so I would agree here.  (The lower the final drive
number the faster the vehicle is going for a given engine rpm)

But my vehicle speed numbers and Everett's differ in that for 
his first gearing option I get 51+ mph for 3,000 and 68.5 mph
for 4,000. Three to four mph isn't that much difference but it
will make a big difference in real world applications.  Figure on
'gaining' 3-4 mph per each gearing change you do.  To go from
a 4.125 R/P set to a 3.875 is worth 3-4 mph, to go from a .89
Type I 4th to a .82 Type II 4th (if someone snuck in a Beetle
gearbox) is worth about 3-4 mph, and so on.  

What some of my Type II conversion customers have noticed
is that if you regularly haul heavy loads up and down hills you
may have to drop into 3rd on a more regular basis than before.
But since most of them simply drive the Bus around and do
not use it for commercial type hauling, the extra leg room of
the 3.875 is very nice for highway cruising.  I've been in several
of the Busses that have my conversion in them and the noise
difference alone is worth it in my book.  No more yelling at 
your passenger to carry on a conversation or the racket from 
the back as the pistons swap jugs whenever you try to merge
with traffic. 

There are those on the list that froth at the mouth anytime an
improvement is made to their beloved Type IIs.  But let's face it,
this is the end of the '90's and these vehicles were originally
designed 40 years ago.  Driving needs have changed for these 
vehicles have changed since then and even though its major
surgery to do this gearing change, its really a minor improvement
using stock ratios.  

If you are one of those that live for bias ply tires, cable actuated 
brakes, and the guy walking in 20 feet in front of you waving a red 
flag, then drive the Bus the way it rolled off the line in '55.  If you 
are someone that doesn't want to be run over everytime you pull 
out of the driveway and hit the freeway, then this is an option to 
consider. 

To each his/her own.....
