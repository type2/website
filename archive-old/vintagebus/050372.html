&gt;, whenever I put my bus in reverse, it stalls out, even if
&gt;I have the clutch fully depressed. It doesn't grind into reverse or
&gt;anything. It drives fine in all the other gears (except for fourth which
&gt;it pops out of, why I am replacing the tranny in the first place). What
&gt;could be the problem? Thanks again.

Chris,
if this is a problem that just occurred after doing some electrical 
work, I'd suggest you check all you connections. On my 56 sedan I 
accidently placed the wrong wire to the after market reverse light 
switch. Ran fine until I shifted into reverse and everything would 
die.
