Hi All  I guess I am the new man(48 years old) on this
list.Here is the quick? rundown on me,seems like the
thing to do.In 1994 good old Mom(now passed away) and
I were driving around town here in San Luis
Obispo,Calif looking for my first VW bus.Not many to
be found for sale but we drove around anyways.And then
she spots a box stock with all the inside panels and
rubber floor mats and 3/4 middle seat 13 window blue
and white 67 Deluxe walk thru (we had no clue thats
what it was) in the parking lot of an apartment
complex.The for sale sign showed the owner wanted a
$1000 bucks.We looked it over...well we looked at it
as we had no idea what to look for.I guess we got
lucky with this one.Found the owners apartment and we
took a test drive.Very strange going down down down
then up up up that first driveway sitting on the nose
of this bus with that flat glass windshield just
inches from my seat.It made me smile.Just had to have
her! I asked him what is the least you would take for
her and still be happy with us? $700 bucks was the
reply...Deal done.When we came back with the money he
told us the story.He was sick with liver problems and
was wanting to take a train ride of the United States
before he passed on so he was selling everything.This
was his sisters bus she had given it to him and his
girlfriend and they enjoyed it for sometime.His sister
lived in Hunnighton Beach and as he said to me...She
met a &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; and he bought her a new car.So far
that luck from the bus has not rubbed off on me...well
not to new car heights.                               
  I put that bus to the test the next several years up
and down the coast of Calif and even out as far as 800
miles from the coast twice.Lived in it several
years.And even had a fire in the engine compartment
when one of the metal gas tubes sticking out of the
fuel pump pops off with hose and clamp still
attached.Pumping fuel all over a hot engine on the
freeway just outside of Barstow in the summer.I thank
the trucker that stopped and put that fire out.My
little fire bottle had no chance with the rubber
engine seal burnning like a old tire with gas on it.He
saved my bus.When I looked up he must have ran back a
quarter mile from where he got his rig
stopped.Truckers are my buds now.My Brother was a
trucker and then a local concrete mixer driver till
cancer took him 8 years ago at 41.Well that first
engine gave up in 98 and I got a bug for $200 bucks
pulled the motor and sold the bug for $100.Now that
1200? engine(0655987) might be at the end of its road
all was fine untill a few weeks ago.I have installed a
new Bosch 009 and plug wires and a new Brosol/Solex
carb pluged all vac outlets and she wont do 45 mph and
has no power? like before.Time for a new one? Well
anyways sorry for the long intro.I enjoy the emails on
site and learn more each time.   Mark and the 67
Deluxe Cloud Bus...Kids in the area say the primer
spots look like clouds on her.
