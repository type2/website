Subject: Carb rebuilders?

I've got this set of 40IDF's for my 1776 and I'd like to ship them of
someplace and have them rebuilt and properly jetted for my engine.  I don't
feel like doing it myself and screwing it up (if you know what I mean.)
Anyone know of a good reputable place that would work these babies over?

Later!
