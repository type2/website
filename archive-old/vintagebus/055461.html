Subject: Re: [VB] new Coleman portable heater

Adrian,

Aside from my interest in vintage VW busses, I am a boater.  Go online to 
boatus_dot_com or westmarine_dot_com and search for cabin heaters.  I personally have 
a SoPac 110v AC heater, which I keep on the boat to heat once the onboard 
reverse cycle systems have been winterized.  It is a great little heater, two 
speeds and a frost cycle.  The other one that is very popular with boaters is 
a Polumis (spelling?).  All of these usually run between $30 and $60 
depending upon features.  Make sure the one you purchase has a shut off in 
the event it gets tipped over.  Good luck.
