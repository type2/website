I checked the odometer on Misato the '67 Kombi Friday and noted that I had exceeded the mileage for the next tune-up a little bit.  Oh, just 3000 miles, but I still decided to take care of it this weekend :-)  With the CDI + Pertronix ignition, and the oil leak fixed, I wasn't getting any of that pre-tune-up lag I'm used to.  It's the first time something didn't need fixin' :-)  Set the valves, one needed adjustment as it was a shade tight.  Changed the oil.  Just pulled the plug and flipped over the crush-washer...no more oil change kits, and I can't afford to go buy one.  Nope, not kidding :-(  Maintenance has reverted to band-aid mode...make it work.  I'm running off my stash of parts.  I knew I bought 'em for a reason...

I went ahead and adjusted the brakes as the pedal had been stopping about an inch from the floor, and the e-brake wasn't working.  One adjusting star on the driver's side rear wheel was stuck; no amount of cursing and pleading would free it.  It was the rear one, so I took the slack out by tightening the e-brake cable.  Had a friend mash the pedal so I could bleed the brakes.  Brakes are rock solid, don't drag, and the e-brake will hold the bus on a steep incline.  Sweet.  I'll pull the drum and free that adjusting star next time...

While I had the rear end up, I ran the engine and put the bus through the gears.  Fourth gear at idle...man.  Sitting up front, it sounded like the pass. rear wheel was launching a Saturn V.  Push-pull on the wheel revealed around 1mm of play.  I'm thinkin' that gearbox needs a bearing or two.  The tranny pops out of second and howls horrendously in fourth, so I'm thinking I'll just drive on it and ignore the RGB for now.  Thoughts on this?  I can't afford new bearings, but I have a spare big-nut tranny under the porch that might have better ones.  Worth the trouble for a languishing tranny?

Another problem.  The stuff that keeps the rod from the accel petal in that L shaped piece has ceased to be.  I had been wondering where that extra inch or so of pedal had gone...Misato has been struggling up some hills of late that she used to take running.  I can rig something up, but I was wondering if someone could tell me a good way to do it?  It works as-is, but there is a lot of slop and I can't get full throttle at the carb.

This is the first summer where I haven't been able to work.  Class all day, and I'm a telescope operator at night.  Funds are tight to say the least.  It's becoming difficult to keep the bus on the road, I guess we'll see what I can pull off though :-)

Some folks have emailed me regarding the doc project, yeah it has stalled for now but as I get used to the new schedule I'll get some scanning in.  Rex Rogers has been kind enough to convert what is available to PDF form for me.  At the least I'll get those linked properly in the next coupla days.  For those interested, the site is here:
