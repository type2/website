Subject: RE: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto

It's hard to say whether 4700 is out of line without seeing the vehicle....
I'd consider what the going shop rate is.  Here in LaGrande OR, the going
rate is ~50/hr.  I know my 59 double cab was a little above that for the
body work alone but a week of time was spent just on straightening out the
bed.

I have never paid for a full on restoration but a close friend of mine
just got a bid on his 67 Double Cab and I was going to see if any of you
had some input on cost and maybe some other places he should look into.
He has all of the welding completed and the quote is for sandblasting
and then POR 15 the whole double cab and then bodywork and primer. The
bodywork is the smoothing process not welding in major panels as that
has been done already. The quote was for $4700. This would still need a
good paint job on top of that number. It seems a little high to me since
I know this guy is not looking for a show truck just a really nice
driver.
