I used a glass one before too, but I had the same problem, also the thing got stripped out from getting overtightened. I just use the plastic one between the carb and pump and check it religiously. The one on there now can't be more than 6 months old. About time to change.

the fuel pump
doesn't like to suck through the filter? Let me check the archives...Doh!

  That was going to be my question. Would putting the filter before the pump 
put undue stress on the pump.
  My Bus vapor locked on me this past weekend. I clamped on a wooden clothes 
pin and was on my way. Don't ask me why it works but it does. I need to replace 
fuel line and re-route it. I think I'll also move my fuel filter now.
  I tried using the glass filter before, that you can unscrew and clean out. 
But it seamed to seep gas, so I went back to the plactic ones.
