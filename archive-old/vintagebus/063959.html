Subject: Re: [VB] Transport Companies

I already looked up info on California Attorney General..... I've got the
info but really no ammo to shoot with. At least not now. They don't refuse
to transport my Bus. They just keep saying that I have &quot;Discount order&quot; and
as soon as some carrier decides to take it I'll have my Bus. If I want to
speed up my order I need to come up with extra $200.00 - simple. The only
questionable thing that has happened so far was the treatment I get when I
call. The guy is just not pleasant, that's all. So as you see, all I can do
for now is dish out extra $200.00 and wait. Oh yes, I also have another
choice.... hire another company and hope that previous guy gives me at least
some of my money back...... after a few months of dragging his feet.....


either way, I need to wait.
Thanks John,

&gt; It's time for you to quit whining to these thieves and send a record of
&gt; their broken promises and your correspondence to the Illinois Attorney
&gt; General's office.
&gt; The transport company is betting you won't bother with prosecution, so
they
&gt; can do business any way they damn well please.
