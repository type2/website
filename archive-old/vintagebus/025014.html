&gt; For one thing, yes I do know what a bastard motor looks like.  I have
&gt; one sitting in front of me everyday in my shop.  Second, don't make
&gt; judgments on other folks 'authority' from just an email posted to a list
&gt; on the net...you have no idea what I know or what I own or have owned.
&gt; Making these assumptions you look foolish doing so when you are
&gt; wrong...and you are.

You know, I have rear Eric and Barb's comments over a couple times now,
and I fail to see what they said that was so very demeaning or
insulting. I will immediately claim ignorance as far as the bastard
engine/air cleaner question. But I think that by stating what Eric and
Barb think they know, they have insulted no one. I read nothing assuming
in their post, and I fail to see where all the vitriol is coming from.
Todd and Carrie may well be correct. I have said things on the list that
I later realized ( or it was pointed out to me) were wrong. If I said
these things to a person who knew better than I did, that person
graciously pointed it out.

What &quot;judgements on other folks 'authority' were made? E and B stated
their opinion, knowledge, and backed it up with the reasoning behind it.
Correct or incorrect, they have every right to join the discussion. Or
why are we here?

This last post of Todd's comes close to personal insults and name
calling.

What gives?
