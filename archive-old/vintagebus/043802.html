&gt;It seems the screw on terminal headlight switch is the right one for
&gt;my 59.  Now since it doesn't have terminal #57, where do I hook up the
&gt;little parking lights to make them work?

Hook them to terminal 58.  *Not* terminal 58a, or else they will be
on the dash-light dimmer circuit!  Hooking them to 58 means they
will come on at the first click and stay on at the second click,
which isn't stock for a USA-spec Bus but it won't hurt anything.
