Steve,

&gt; 1) Are the blocks that slide in the roof channel supposed to be
&gt; wood. If so does anyone
&gt;             make reproductions 
&gt; 
Yes, they are supposed to be wood. and Wolfsburg West sells a repo kit made
of teflon.  They say it slides better.

&gt; 2) Can you use the -'63 sunroof handle on a '64-'67 front
&gt; locking bow? The bows seem the
&gt;             same other than the handle, but not sure. ( the bow that
&gt; came with the van is really rusted.)
&gt; 
My roommate looked at this and said that there was some difference about
handle shaft lengths.  That's all I know.

&gt; 3) Has anyone installed a sunroof cover? The one I got from
&gt; W.C.M. has no instructions, and
&gt;             the pictures in the Bentley are kind on lacking. Any tips
&gt; would be appreciated.
&gt; 
Doing it right now. My roomate said that Bently had the best instructions.
Best thing to do for the Header bow is to glue it on and not to rivet it
like the old days.

&gt;         4) I have to replace the two strips of  &quot;rubberized canvas&quot; that
&gt; run down the outer side of the
&gt;             bows. Are the bows supposed to be a certain distance apart
&gt; and is each one spaced equally
&gt;             from the front to the back
&gt; 
These strips are important.  Find material very similar that does NOT
stretch.  These are used to pull the other &quot;leafs&quot; when shutting the rag.


	I'm working of advice from my roomate.  he's pretty good at picking
up nuances of installations.  I'm in the middle of installing one myself so
I will hopefully pick up those nuances as well.

	GOOD LUCK!
