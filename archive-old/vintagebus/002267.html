hi, rex ! i'm a newbie, and i haven't been following your
posts, but i'm just gonna jump in the deep end and tell 
you what i think ! there are a hundred ways to do this job, 
and some of them are right. there are a lot of really techy 
ways, too. however:
time the vw engine at the top, or &quot;all in&quot;. in other words,
spin it so that all advance is applied, and set the distributor
at the  full advance mark, and let the bottom be wherever it is !

as for the choke, and wherever you are, it's function as a 
warm-up device needs to be reset to suit you, and your
situation in the space-time continuum.i.e. ambient temp,etc.
so get a feel for no choke by putting your finger down the hole
and flexing the butterfly when the engine is dead cold and the
choke hasn't been activated (warmed up ). then adjust the choke 
to give a little tension against finger/ butterfly. then start/ run and 
finger test to get the idea of what the choke is doing. if it is choked
too long, back it off . as you become used to this testing procedure, 
it will become second nature- add choke in the fall and back off in the 
spring- along about daylight savings time- try it, you'll like it !
