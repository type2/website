Subject: Re: [VB] Complete wiring harness install on a 67-How hard, 

Splitnosers,

  I've put 3 wiring harnesses in different year splits, and have this to
add.

- put glycerin on the harness black shrink wrap, it helps slip through the
beam when your pulling it through.  Be sure to make the junction of the
pulling line unbreakable, and have a friend help guide it through.

-  as the years went by, more wires were added to the main harness for gas
tank sender.  This is a good thing, more wires will make life easy for you
in the future when you need to add electical components.  You may want to
talk to wiring works about your options.

- I used both his instructions and the diagrams and the good Thom site
Vintagebus, it seemed rather straighforward and easy, but then again, I
was a ET (electronics tech) in the Navy.

-  the biggest danger is the front headlight loom, it is now fused in the
kits, but boy are you in trouble if you don't know the gray and brown
wires in the headlight bucket proper placement.  Pay close attention to
here or it will take microseconds to fry.

-  it is a good idea to clean up all the copper tangs on the fuse box and
connectors, but that will take awhile.  Radio Shaq makes a terminal
cleaner abrasive pen and other nice implements.

-  bad grounds are usually the fault --  when all else seems to check out.
Your main &quot;floating&quot; grounds of the battery and transmission strap are the
first place to start making sure it contacts shiny metal.  Then to every
brown wire to screw body ground.

-  take your time, use flashlights, mirrors, and testing lights.  Don't
know if you'll need a multimeter, I didn't.

Best,
joe
