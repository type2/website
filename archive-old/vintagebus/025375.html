Irvine, California,
	I removed the engine in my '67 bus in Irvine several times in public
places.  A cop stopped by once just after the engine came out and was
sitting next to the side cargo doors.  He told me that I can't do that
here! looked at the engine on the ground and left.  I guess I just did
it!  Irvine is a sick and twisted place that I use to call home for 6
years(UCI, right).  Irvine does not want to be bad.  Money makes it
so....   Gary Gibson
