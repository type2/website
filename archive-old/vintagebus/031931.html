&gt; Has anyone else encountered this and more importantly came up with a
&gt; solution? I pitched the pods, so putting them back in is out.

Use the engine-to-body heat tubes from a lagwagen (68+) they'll 
slip right in, and have non-toxis insulation.  I like the
really late ones that are plastic accordian things.

this ties two threads together.    I was driving down I 5  in Oregon a few
years ago in my 61, and the fan belt broke.    Oh merde.  Okay, pulled over,
changed fan belt.  The belt had broken- thrashed to bits- one of the fresh air
tubes (right hand side), so I mushed it closed to the air pressure wouldn't
blow out of it.  I didn't have a spare with me.    A few miles down the road
there is this awful melting plastic smell coming from the heater.  Pulled over
again, the heater box to body tube was one of those plastic accordian things,
and was melting.  I pulled it out and tossed it in the back of the bus.   no
heat, but no smell.

This taught me that...  The heater boxes get much much hot w/o the fresh air
tube in place, whether or not the heat is on (it never melted before until the
fresh air tube was shut off).  They shouldn't melt the plastic tube there-
they need that fresh air tube badly (got one asap)

and made me think - hm they must cool the exhaust, and make the engine run
cooler.   And that I should always carry a spare fresh air tube with me.    (
I like the plastic ones- sturdier against lashing fan belts and pressure
washers too)

BTW, what is a &quot;pod&quot;.   I was thinking about the best way to reinsulate the
heat duct from underneath to the front of a type 2.     It would have to not
absorb water, but some would get in anyway driving around on wet roads, and I
dont want the tube wrapped ina wet sponge to speed rust out.   Think I'll
think about that, as I am sure some heat is lost on the trip under the bus
from rear to front.
