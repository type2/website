&lt;&lt; my driver's side decklid hinge is loose. The bolts just turn and turn. Is 
there a plate in there like the ones for the cargo door hinges? Is there a 
way to remedy this problem or am I screwed? when it is shut, everything is 
AOK, so I can live with it, but I'd like to fix it. &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
First the fasteners that mount the engine lid hindges should be screws with 
machine threads.  If it is these you are talking about and they just keep 
turning there is a definite problem.  You will have to cut an access hole in 
the body or deck lid to get to the nut plate inside and stop it from turning. 
 Then figure out a way to fix the problem once and for all followed by 
welding back in the area you cut out to access the area.  Eric&amp;Barb
