&lt;&lt; Whats the process for adjusting the side cargo doors on a 67 bus. The side 
 cargo door with the exterior handle is riding high and I want to lower it a 
 few mm. 
  &gt;&gt;
open the door, 

look in the door jamp by the hinges- see the phillip[s head bolts that holsd 
thedoors on- 

remove round plastic covers if neccessary

use impact hammer thing you mash with the big phillps socket thang on it.  
use penetrating oil.  these bolts can be really hard to undo.   loosen them 
up, and wiggle the door a little to reposition it.  You might as well remove 
the bolts one at a time, clean up the threads they go in with a tap, use 
grease or some such to keep it from sticking, and reinstall.

tighten bolts- lined up right?  set to go.
