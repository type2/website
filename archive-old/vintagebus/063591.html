&gt; What??????? it was never a standard issue. Where do you get that info?
&gt; Always an option. Supposedly started in 62, but i have been seeing them as 
&gt; far back as 56.

Hi Wade,
Do not remember where we got that info.  Did check and did find our sale 
brochures for truck do list it as a option as late as 1963, but we have no 
recollection of ever seeing a post-1962 SC with only one tool bay door.
