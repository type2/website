&gt;I have a 1600 DP that is running fine but I need to rev to 4200-4500 to
keep up with traffic. I know this is not great for longevity, even with a
dog house, and synthetic oil. Temps stay under 225. A trans swap to IRS and
longer gears is planned &quot;sometime.&quot; &lt;

You could add a C/W crank and balance the whole thing to make it easily turn
up to 5000RPM for extended time.  You could get a freeway flier tranny.
Instead of flipping for the cash for a new motor just go ahead and do an IRS
rear end now, which will probably be less expensive.

&gt;   I note that 2.4 L 911 motors with 5 speed trannys are now becoming
available at about $2,000+/- in good used condition. &lt;
 
Wow!  2.4 Motor and 901 tranny!  Then again I agree no good for a bus, but
good if I had an extra early Porsche body sitting around :)  Muuuuhahahaha!

&gt;   I have the opportunity to buy a 912E motor complete with all FI parts,
engine tin, and rear engine support bar, heater boxes, etc., for $1,500 in
good used rebuilt shape. It is basically a 2L Type 4 motor with a Porsche
factory conversion to an upright fan, fuel injection with a mass air flow
sensor (good stuff) and about 95 HP at about 6,000 rpm, great torque at
about 4,000 rpm. &lt;

The engines are the same except for the heads (bigger valves for high end)
and camshaft.  The reason the Porsche type 4s rev higher is because the cars
are lighter, no bottom end differences.  

FI can be a PITA to trouble shoot and fix $ if it does not work properly
from the beginning.  You still need to get an adapter for the transmission
from Kennedy Engineering.    The tinware most certainly will not line up
right, so you will butcher the Porsche stuff or end up using some of the Joe
Cali tricks or Oregon Performance parts.

It may be cheaper in the long run to go with a used VW type 4 engine, a 1.8
would be super cheap/free, and get the conversion kit for $400ish.  Put in a
WebCam camshaft and lifters and you are good to go.  

One day I hope to drop a 1.8 or 2.0 type 4 conversion in my bus so I wish
you luck, but I do not think the 912 E engine is the way to go because of
the extra hassle.  Save the rare stuff for a Porsche Nazi anyway, the VW
crowd steals enough crap from them already.  Leave the Fuchs on the
Porsches! 


Good Luck,
