Hi all,

I just want to publicly send thanks out to Greg Nobel and Eric&amp;Barb for
relaying an old empi fiberglass rear seat up from Yucca Valley CA to me here
in LaGrande OR... I think the path was Yucca Valley, Pomona, 1000 Oaks,
Sacramento, Olympia, Puyallup, and finally to LaGrande.  This thing was too
big to ship via normal means and trucking it didn't make monetary since...

I owe both of you a favor! :-)


David
