I need a  headlight switch for a '63 bus.


Hi,
What wattage headlights are you running?  Are your fuses getting so  hot you 
can burn your fingers on them with the headligths on?  We are  selling 1961-67 
head light switches that we have taken aparts and soldered all  riveted 
connections together for $40.00 outright or $20.00 with trade in of  rebuildable 
(not burnt up) switches.  These for us are good to up to 60  Watt headlight 
bulbs.  More wattage than that and you will have to install  a headligth relay s
ystem to take the extra load.
