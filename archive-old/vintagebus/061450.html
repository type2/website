Subject: '67 splash pan

Hi everybody,

I found a splash pan for my bus but when I tried to
install it tonight it appears that the dual MC is
butting up against the rear of the pan.  Did the 67
have a larger bubble to accomodate for the dual MC? 
Or was there a hole cut for where it meets the pan? 
Any help would be appreciated.

Gene
'67 Deluxe (Ziggy)
