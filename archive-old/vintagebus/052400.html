I've been driving and enjoying my '67 Westy less often since I moved
downtown.  Mass transit is often easier, cheaper, and faster.  But I
try to find excuses to drive the bus whenever I can.

Well, the bus has been making me scratch my head recently.  For a while
I thought I must have forgotten how to set the valves, since I had 
constant valve-sounding noise.  But every time I checked, they were fine.
So I reasoned the noise was the warped pulley.  Replacing that with a less
warped one (heh) didn't make it less.  So I bought a new one, and got a
really straight generator pulley at a swap too.  Both pulleys are straight
and true.  There's still noise, so I just figured it was valves and
forgot about it.

Later on I was doing some work at Easterwood's place.  Running the engine
I noticed that the noise seemed louder, and seemed to be coming from the
center of the engine.  I verified with those present that this was not a
normal sound for a VW engine to make.  We took it to Ron's place a couple
days later since he had built the engine.  It appeared to be the fuel 
pump making the noise, so I replaced both it and the pushrod one day at
work...same noise.  

The noise is a clank-clank-clank that seems to come from the neighborhood
of the crank pulley.  It's not super loud, and goes away more or less
completely at any RPM much above fast idle, but it's quite pronounced at
idle.  It seems to be louder when throttling down, and maybe a little louder
when the engine is warm.  There's no slop in the crank pulley at all and
it doesn't move in or out, up or down.  It's a 1600 DP with the only mods
being a full-flow case and a counter-balanced crank.

The next step seems to be pulling the engine and dropping it off at Ron's
place...this is very difficult for me since I live in the city, and this
is my only vehicle :-)  Can anybody think of anything else I might check
before doing this?  It runs really great, but it makes that noise...
