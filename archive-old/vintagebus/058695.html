Excluding all in town roads, the road into Bucks Lake, California.  The old 
one from the East side.  If I recall correctly it is a surprising 27% grade.

&gt;
&gt;In my rant about my bus I was trying to remember the worst, most extreme 
&gt;climbs I ever drove.
&gt;
&gt;I came up with:
&gt;
&gt;East out of Salt Lake City, heading to Cheyenne, Wyoming.
&gt;
&gt;North out of Bishop California. I think I was heading for Lake Isabella.
&gt;
&gt;Reno, Nevada to Grass Valley, California.
&gt;
&gt;I-5 at the Cal- Oregon border (honorable mention, not too bad)
