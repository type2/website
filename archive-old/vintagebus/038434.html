When you talk about fit, do you mean the front or rear?

I've only put these on the front...

Thom and I took the fronts off in Sacramento and it had (worn) 215's at the
time.  Don't remember anything special about it.  I do nice the fit is tight
at the back of the front wheel well.

As for the rear -- 215's were on there when I purchased the Truck.  I've had
no reason to pull them yet, but you and I can find out next weekend :)

So, what the heck is everyone purchasing for 15&quot; tires?  I just couldn't
find a Load C in anything less than 215 size.

will 215 75 15 tires fit?   They are wider- so?    another question I have
is
how wide a tire is appropriate for what size rim.    evidently the 14&quot; rims
are 5&quot; wide and the 15&quot; rims are 41/2&quot; wide.   I am talking about width
here.
I have run 205 75 15&quot; tires on my 61 NSR deluxe on the 41/2&quot; wide rims for
about 20 K miles, and am getting uneven wearing- more at the edge, which may
be due to the flex.  And I should run them at above the recommended
pressure.
These are the lower rated tires PSI wise, and it would be better to get the
higher rated tires with the stiffer sidewall.  But I have not had the uneven
wear problem with 185 or 195 tires- so wonder if the 205 may be too wide for
the 41/2&quot; wide rims,      Would there be problems fitting them in the wheel
arch?    The 205s are pretty close.    actually as you have a 63 your  type2
probably have the later wheel arches that have more room (is this a
coincidence that he wheel arches changed close to the change to wider rims?)
