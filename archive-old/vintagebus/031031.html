Subject: Re: [VB] Dumb fuel filter question (best place)
References: &lt;Springmail.105.990042123.0.50418700_at_springmail_dot_com&gt;

After working at a lot of VW places here in the South Bay area, there
seems to be a strong opinion about the location of the fuel filter.  The
shop that is next door to my house even has a sign hanging up in their
lounge about it.

They all agree that having the fuel filter in the engine compartment is
a VERY BAD IDEA.  

The best place on a bug is right out of the framerail, steering clear of
the heater box.

The best place on a bus is a small loop before the clip that holds the
fuel line under the tank.

Putting the fuel filter in the engine compartment is just asking for
trouble.

&gt; OK, I got the '66 Camper a new carb and now she purrs, well, &quot;rumbles&quot; might be the more appropriate word!  Anyway this bus has a 71 engine in it (I think) and the engine looks exactly like the one in my 71 Super beetle except for the position of the little plastic fuel filter.  I suspect the one on the 66 bus is in the wrong place, but I want to confirm this fact before I go changing it.  On the beetle the filter is on the fuel line between the fuel pump and the carb, however, on the bus it is located on the fuel line between the tank and the fuel pump BEFORE the line enters the fuel pump.  Which of these is right\wrong.  My bet is that it goes AFTER the fuel pump BEFORE the carb, but I want to be sure.  And if it is in the wrong place, is this likely to affect performance at all??
