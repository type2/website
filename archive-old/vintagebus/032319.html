&gt;told me that Sundials have pie shaped cutouts in this strip of wood

Hi Edward...anybody who tells you &quot;this is the way it is&quot; when talking
about a non-Westy camper is full of it. They were all made to the whim of
the day. Some Sundials had notches every 12 inches or so. My EZ Camper (it
has a tag, so I know that's what it is) has nothes every 6 inches or so,
but I've seen other EZ's that are different.

The people that tell you that kind of thing are also likely to tell you
that you don't have a &quot;real&quot; camper because it's not a Westfalia. That's
malarkey as well. The off-brand campers were sold at dealerships just like
Westfalias were.

The only thing you have to go on is the scratched off tag with the serial
number. It sounds like the tag off of an EZ Camper. EZs are the only ones
I've seen that have serial numbers like that. Although...like I said above,
that is not the law, just my personal observation. The problem I have with
my own theory is that my EZ's serial number is higher than yours, but was
built in 1965. Is there any possibility that the serial number had the
first digit scratched off too?

  The back cabinets, the ones over the engine, are real
&gt;strange too.  They each have a 10 inch square sliding door, with a
&gt;little round metal finger hole to open it.  The opening is rounded on
&gt;the corners.  What is so strange is that on each side cabinet is a piece
&gt;of 1/2 inch plywood sitting on end.  These pieces are about 6-8 inches
&gt;long, and look like a shelf would rest on the surface of each.  On the
&gt;forward corner of each piece is a little plastic roller, as though a
&gt;shelf or a seat, (part of a fold up bed?) should rest on it.  The
&gt;cabinet door pulls are all copper in color, with points on the ends that
&gt;attach to the cabinets.    The Icebox has the water tank in the back of
&gt;the unit, the side that backs up to the back of the passenger side.
&gt;There is a spice rack on the inside of the rear cargo door.  It has 3-4
&gt;shelves, with 3 holes in the top to hold cups.  There are two metal tags
&gt;on the outside, just below the forward cargo door.  One is the green
&gt;State Of California tag, and the other is an aluminum tag about 2&quot;X3&quot;,
&gt;attached with a rivet on each side of the tag.  Whatever had been
&gt;painted on the tag, such as Sundial, or Riviera, or whatever, has been
&gt;scratched off.  The numbers across the center read 1967
&gt;SN          356.  The side windows are pop-outs on the front and back
&gt;window on each side, with a louvered window in the center on the drivers
&gt;side, and in the rear cargo door on the passenger's side.  There are
&gt;three windows on each side.  I checked the M-Codes on this bus.  They
&gt;showed a walk-thru interior, 6 pop-out windows, and seat belt mounts.
&gt;The port of entry for this bus was Los Angeles.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry that this is so long winded.  I'm hoping that someone on this site
&gt;can help me identify this bus.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you in advance for your help,
