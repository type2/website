Subject: RE: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Waving and not getting waved back? Not the bus but the
driver?
Dunno about that but it's a theory worth discussing
for weeks when the bandwidth is available. Paula
purebred was a little hesitant to begin driving the
zero mile Tararam '67 camper restoration because she
said that she felt more &quot;like a celebrity&quot; and got
more waves and smiles while driving the old
pseudo-Euro '57 single cab which needed everything.
Huh? I didn't know that it was a &quot;look at me&quot; thing-
In di alteh guteh tseiten I just drove the suckers
because I liked them.
I noticed that I stopped getting flipped off five
times per day when I switched from the Kam vos er
kricht '63 EZ camper to the 75 mph F150 with A/C.
Phoenix drivers tend to blend in at any speed as long
as you drive a Domestic pick up truck dumped to the
ground with at least one lawn mower in the back, a
reflective mylar cowqboy hat (that is supposed to
communicate what I don't know) and a Calvin and Hobbes
character urinating on the words &quot;La Migra&quot;. Whoever
La Migra is he surely must have &quot;p*ssed off&quot; a ton of
landscaping people. Truly they must all need a Kaneh.
Commenting on the original observation of not getting
waved at by someone in a baywindow- I figured that the
bay driver was probably a Yenteh fat chick adjusting a
bra strap, staddling a BigGulp and a $99. hotdog while
inserting the latest Yanni/Linda Evans-Babs Streisand
retrospective cassette tape. &lt;Oi, Vai!, I'm feeling
Veklemped!&gt; Either that or it was a guy trying to
placate the demands of the K'vatsh, Tshatshki fat
chick in the passenger seat who was searching for the
casette tape. If it was a splittie it might have been
due to their inability to quickly do the requisite
origami contortionist thing with their arm in order to
stuff it through the sliding drivers window.
