&lt;&lt;  For example, what VW model year(s) was the Sapphire 1 radio installed in? 
 The
 Sapphire 3?  The Sapphire 5?  etc, etc.  Is this info out there somewhere?  
I'm particularly interested in the Sapphire radio info, but perhaps info on 
the other brand radios (Blaupunkt, Becker, etc) would be of help to others 
too. &gt;&gt;

Hi Bill,
From what we have found the Sapphire 1 &amp; 2 came out in early 61.  The bug 
Sapphire radio faces and push buttons were differantly shaped designed than 
the bus, KG ones.  Late 65 or early 66 the Sapphire 3 &amp; 4 came out.  Best not 
to wonder what VW model year(s) were they put in they were a dealer accessory 
which were often put in VWs years after they left the showroom.  Probably 
this often happened when the owner had finally paid off the dealer for thier 
VW and used the extra cash the next month to buy a radio.  We have a piece of 
literature for a Blaupunkt radio all transistor that came out in 1961.  The 
instructions are for installing it in a pre-1958 bug (oval).
  Tube radios were the cuting edge up to about 58.  Hybrid (Tubes with some 
transistors) radios came about 58-60, and suddenly all transistors came out 
in 61.  Which really messed up some manufactures whom had invested in hybrid 
radio manufacturing and suddenly had to reinvest in transistor only radios.
   Eric&amp;Barb
PS A Sapphire 5 radio would have come out later than 67, but would have been 
another of those installed in the 1958-67 bugs and 67 and later buses and KGs.
