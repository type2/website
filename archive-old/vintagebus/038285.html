That sounds about right. These things were imoprted into South Africa in a
big way so there are still loads of them around - fig(the other south
african list member has a few of them in panel and 15 window
configurations).

Most have their first SA registration as 1976 so it would seem likely, as
they were assembled from SKD kits, that 1975 would have been the last year
of split manufacture in Brazil.

To the casual observer the only obvious external difference between them and
any post '63 German bus is that the VW emblem is pressed into the skin.

Later
