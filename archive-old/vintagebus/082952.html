Subject: Re: [VB] switched to dual carbs, need details.

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; Could someone point me to where to buy jets &amp; how to change them?
&gt; Carbs are 35mm Solex w/ electric chokes... (bought from oldvolks_dot_com)

If you bought them from oldvolks_dot_com, i'm sure they would be happy to help
you get them setup and jetted right. Have you checked with them as to what
they recommend to you?
