Subject: Murder investigation---The Latest News

I have called Officer Keeling to offer full cooperation from this group.  I
explained to him the nature of the A.I.R.S. organization and told him where
he could access all of the member names from the area where the crime
occured.

I also forwarded him Joe Fourniers e-mail from last friday night requesting
assistance for this young lady.  She is the one and the same that Joe wrote
to this list about and offered her help by fixing the carb on her bus.

I explained to him that Joe's message was sent out to list members all over
the world, and that we would all be compliant and offer whatever help we
could to catch this piece of crap.

I have spoekn with Joe and he is getting in touch with Officer Keeling this
evening.  

The officer speculated that while at the rest stop she had gone to the pond
some 100 yards away to take a skinny dip swim, and that is where the crime
was comitted.  He said that that is where the crime was comitted.  She was
found nude and had suffered a very violent death.  He also said there was NO
sexual assault shown in the autopsy.

Please folks, if you get a call from the officer please offer any help you
can if she got in touch with you on her journey.  The FBI is also involved.
There are aslo reports on CNN and other news networks.

I am sorry for the awful details but I wanted you to know what I had found
out from the conversations with the officer.  Please help and call this
gentleman if you heard from her at all while she was alive.

If I can find the family name and number I will call and offer our
condolances.  I also would like to raise funds for flowers also to maybe
help future travelers to find a safe place to sleep if none of us are
nearby.

If anyone has further thoughts on what we might do as a group please let me
know.
