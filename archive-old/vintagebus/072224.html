&gt; I think I asked the list about this before-and no one had taken one apart,

Hi Kevin,
First check if the switch is having a voltage drop!!  We have taken a OG VW 
switch  from the 1960s partly apart by drilling out the tube like rivets that 
are flared at either end through the holes that mount this switch to the floor 
with the two big screws.
