Hi JB,
You can easily remove the outer RGB half without pulling the lower outer 
roller bearing.  The outer race will slide off with the outer RGB half and 
the rest of the roller bearing will remain on the lower stub axle.  With the 
outer RGB half off you need to remove the inner half of the RGB from the 
swing plate.  Really best you loosen these eight bolts that mount the RGBs to 
the swing plates while the bus is still on it's wheels!  Then clean the 
crevice around the RGB plugs with a sharp knife like a Exacto to remove all 
the rust and dirt that would otherwise prevent the plug from sliding out 
easily.  Either weld and pull the plug or drill and use a screw type body 
puller to remove the plug.  We like to weld a half thickness nuts (With cut 
off bolt pieces with screw driver slot cut into them threaded into these thin 
nuts.) into these plugs so as to use one of the RGB half bolts and a claw 
hammer to remove these plugs in the future!  Take one of the RGB to swing 
plate bolts to go through one of the three holes in the rear of the swing 
plate and threaded into the forward hole of the RGB to keep it from spinning 
when you unbolt the nut on the inside of the lower stub axle.  Take a RGB 
half bolt and fit it inbetween the lower and upper RGB gears so as to lock 
the lower axle while you unbolt the inner lower stub axle locking nut.  Once 
the nut is removed and you have removed the upper outer small C-clip and 
upper outer bearing and the upper drive gear you can use a hammer and punch 
to push the lower axle out of the inner lower bearing.  Remove the Large 
C-clip and push out the lower inner bearing out of the RGB inner half.  Then 
remove the upper inner bearing which can be easy or hard needing the Muir 
bearing puller to remove.  
   Best to just replace all the bearings with new, only the outer lower 
roller bearing of the 64-67 buses can be easily inspected for wear and tear.  
This roller bearing inner half is the only bearing that helps to have a 
puller or press to remove, but one can remove it with hammer and punch if 
carefull not to damge the lower axle or the inner spacer.
  Really a good idea to drill and thread the RGB to swing plate holes as deep 
as possible and install 40mm long bolts to avoid stripping these out in the 
future.  Before we did this as a habit every tranny we installed had at least 
one of the stock short length bolts strip the threads out of the RGB!
  To rebuild everything is pretty much just the reverse just do not hammer 
directly on the lower axle without a piece of wood between th ehammer and the 
lower axle!  The only special tool you might need is a spacer, (We use a 
55-early 64 small axle outer lower axle spacer and thick washer and outer RGB 
half bolt.) washer and bolt to pull the upper axle outward while you 
install/press in/on both the inner and outer bearings and the upper drive 
gear.  Plus applying a layer of high temp silicon sealant on the seam of the 
RGB and plugs just before you rebolt the RGBs to the swing axles seems to 
seal them up well by snadwiching the sealant inbetween!   Eric&amp;Barb
