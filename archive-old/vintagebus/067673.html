&gt;hmmm, I am not sure I understand the problem or what you did.
        OK I've had this bus for 7 or 8 years and was driving through
Arcata, stopped at a stop sign started off in first went to shift into 2nd
and it wasn't there, lots of fumbling  did not want to go into 2nd and
finally found 2nd went on freeway 10 miles to Eureka stopped at a signal put
the  bus in first went to shift into 2nd stayed in first, oh no pulled over
looked under the bus and the rear shift coupler rubber had split and was no
longer connected together. drove home 5 miles in 1st, slowest vehicle in the
bike lane, looked and said easy new coupler and I'm on my way. Well ended up
taking all the couplers off and putting in new ones, reinstalled the
gearshift lever, spring and plate and no amount of ajustment from a neutral
starting point, forward back left right are any of the gears in the right
place kind of a kind of a H pattern with none of the gears where you would
expect them to be. 2 on the top left , 3rd on bottom left, the right side is
a mixture of 3 or 4 not sure which, to engage 1st gear I have to go the the
old reverse gear spot&quot; to the left down and back&quot;

&quot;&gt;stick (Vertical) if installed right.   If should be uppside down and
&gt;backwards from what you think it should be... i mean the hook bit for
reverse
&gt;goes at the front right.  &quot;
I'll check that the reverse plate got put in right. seems like it took my
Son and I  2 hours to get the plate/shiftlever/spring back on. My other
thought was maybe the trans was not in neutral when I put it back to
together..or  it's internal.
 &gt;&gt;What's a DCO?
Dumb Current Owner as opposed to DPO
&gt;sound like you have one or more trannies out?   Take the hockey stick- that
&gt;thing poking out of the nose cone, and wiggle it.  you can use that to
shift
&gt;the tranns into all 5 gears.    Odds are there's something funky in the
&gt;linkage.
&gt;
&gt;look at the front part of the shift rod.  sometimes people cut them out of
&gt;frustration when the coupler is har dto undo.   if it is welded back
together
&gt;slightly twisted that could be enough to stop getting reverse.
&gt;
&gt;the gearshuft housing aka nose cone does come  off when you undo all those
&gt;nuts under the grime.  Get all of them.

&gt;&lt;&lt; The spare trans(complete side to side) I've got the DCO cut off the
&gt; gearshift by sawszalling the coupling on the trans side(bad day).      By
&gt; reading the Bentley it looks like the gearshift housing comes off as one
&gt; unit?            Background= '63 camper will not select gears in the right
&gt; place, I've tried every ajustment I could think of(took of complete
&gt; gearshift&amp; rod,couplings back to trans, put trans into neutral and put
back
&gt; together)  I've got 1,3,4 but 1st you have to push down and back( like
into
&gt; reverse) and there is no reverse, at least that I could find ! Looks like
&gt; I'll end up sending the '63 trans to Rancho but in the meantime I'd like
to
&gt; put in the '64 big nut and try out it's gearing &amp; to see if the bigger
&gt; brakes really make a difference.      So any leads on a complete gearshift
&gt; housing ?       Lloyd in Eureka,Calif    '63 camper
