Subject: Re: [VB]  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!

Factory VW ones are not bad.  List price is $28.30 at VW.  I doubt they
have one in stock, but worth the wait.

&gt; &gt; Just passing along a helpful tip...  Never buy the cheapo chrome generator
&gt; &gt; pulleys made by Empi/Bugpack!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Last night while driving home from the local bus club drive-in movie night
&gt; &gt; the generator light came on...  So I pulled over immediately to check that
&gt; &gt; the fan belt was still on.  Yep, looked good and thought maybe the battery
&gt; &gt; or generator might be toast, no big deal can make it home on battery
&gt; &gt; power.  Closed the lid and carried on...  Watched the oil temperature
&gt; &gt; climb from 180 to 220 in about a mile!  Oh snap!  Time to pull it over at
&gt; &gt; a well lit gas station (Chevron in this case).  Open up the lid one more
&gt; &gt; time and hand turn the pulley shaft, but yet the belt pulley housing will
&gt; &gt; not turn.  This is odd.  I thought I must have sheared the woodruff key,
&gt; &gt; big problem since I do not carry a spare (never heard of one breaking
&gt; &gt; before).  Take off the pulley/shims and find that the pulley woodruff key
&gt; &gt; grove was totally reamed out!  Insert profanity here towards
&gt; &gt; Taiwan/China/EMPI/Bugpack :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Luckily I called a buddy at midnight and he yanked his assembly off of his
&gt; &gt; '71 to donate for the journey home.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Needless to say I was very disappointed in the quality of the metal in the
&gt; &gt; chrome generator pulley parts.  I am now in the process of getting a real
&gt; &gt; VW part.  Of course the local VW FLAPS was pushing the chrome job again
&gt; &gt; and I was like no way dude.
&gt; &gt;
