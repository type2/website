&lt;&lt; You don't mention if you replaced the drums.  &lt;Snip&gt;&gt; Just a thought 
before you replace stuff that might not be bad, get a micrometer and check 
those drums, I'll bet you 10 bucks they are out of spec.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Actually you really do not need a micrometer.  A good ruler/tape measure and 
your eye should be good enough to see how bad the drum is.  Just make sure to 
use the measuring tool starting on the one inch/one centmeter line for your 
zero to get a more accurate reading.   Eric&amp;Barb
