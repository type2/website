Subject: Re: [VB] Considering Selling 68 Square - Whats it worth?

RVB has a lot of dealer lit on Dodge Caravans, Plymouth Voyagers, etc...

Hey Jim; grab armloads of that lit, then in 15 years, put it on ebay and make
a mint!

&gt; My job situation has recently changed - requiring me to drive more frequently 
&gt; - lots more miles.  I am considering selling my '68 Squareback - and getting 
&gt; something more comfortable and more reliable.  Any insight on what I may be 
&gt; able to get for it if I do sell it?
