I agree about this w/ respect to a house by Frank Lloyd Wright, but, as much 
as we care for them, I can't see busses in the same category.  FLW built 
one-off homes, to suit the site and the owners, but our favorite vehicles 
were produced on an assembly line, where the designer had no idea who, 
specifically, would be buying his creation.  They only wanted to sell the 
maximum number of busses.

PS  This doesn't mean that I'm going to paint over the graphics (some of the 
responses didn't want to qualify it as art) on my Grateful Dead bus!
