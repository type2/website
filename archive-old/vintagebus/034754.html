&lt;&lt; The arm on my passenger side mirror broke off. It is now flush with the 
hinge. On the bottom there is about half an inch sticking out of the hinge. 
What on earth do I do now? &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
Use a hammer and long punch of a diameter slightly smaller than the mirror 
arm post.  Hammer it down.  If it moves easily just keep going.  If it is 
hard to move tap it down and back up several times and oil now and then.  
This up down movement will work the oil into the entire length of the post.  
Which should help lubricate it and make it easier to get it out!  Eric&amp;Barb
