Subject:  Re: [VB] difference btwn 65 &amp; 66-67

RMMW has 65-67 engine deck lid # 211 827 025G.
This lid is not OEM look, the indent is straight down
and the latch is 66-67 style.

&gt; It's the latch that's different. '66 and '67 had the newfangled
 &gt; pushbutton latch.

 &gt; &gt; I am looking at some decklids-the guys elling say they are only good for
 &gt; &gt; 66-67. It looks the same as mine(I have a '65). Does anyone know what the
 &gt; &gt; difference is?
