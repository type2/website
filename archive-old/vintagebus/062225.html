Hi Lars,
Then you do not have a 1963 model VW bus, but a 1964 model.  VW took up the 
early year change at the begining of AUG each year from the USA auto 
manufatures in 1955.  Before this change the model year change was at the end 
of the year.  Problem for auto manufactures changing model years at the end 
of the year was several months of autos would be showing up in the next new 
year due to shipping delays and no one wanted to buy the last year model, but 
wanted the next year model with all its improvements and/or style changes.
  So if you really want to have a small rear window you will have to either 
cut off the rear of your bus and weld in the rear hatch area of the model 
year before, or cut out the rear window in the rear hatch you have now and 
weld in an earlier window opening.
  BTW the big flashers up front showed up here in the USA in mid 1962 model 
year.
