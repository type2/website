FWIW, I did the math and experiments, and if you need the 27&quot; and have
26.5&quot;, the speedometer and odometer error induced is 5% above actual.
In other words, if you've actually gone forty miles, the odometer will
claim forty two.  Speedometers seem to have enough other variances in
them that indicated speed is only vaguely related to actual (going by
specific measurements using radar, known-distance drives, etc).
