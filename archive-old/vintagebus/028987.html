scott....

    the recommendation i have heard is to replace one's rubber oil lines on a
yearly basis... the rationale being that petroleum &amp; ozone &amp; heat cycles have
detrimental effects on them. those three, i believe, are the reason for your
bubble, not the overheating alone. overflexing, twisting or kinking a hose can
also make the affected area weaker and prone to blowouts, bubbles, etc....
    i have used berg stainless-jacketed teflon hoses for 5 years with no
problems yet, though hydraulic hose is IMHO a suitable replacement.
    walmart and other places sell a fiber-optic dealie that goes on the end of
your mini-maglite, to get light into tight places.... they sell one in
particular that is very very long... several feet. check for it in the
camping/flashlight section. if you had one of those, and some tiny mirrors
(inspection mirrors on a stick, whatever... same place has 'em), it would be
easier to see in there without removing as many parts.
    do you have a doghouse or non-doghouse fan shroud? this determines the plan
of going about inspecting your oil cooler....
    http://www.type2_dot_com/library/cooling/coolsami.htm is a good troubleshooting
guide for one's overheating woes.
