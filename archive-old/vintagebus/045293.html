Hi,
Just a thought, have you or your VW guru check to see if the cam bore is 
twisted or too tight?  In early 40HP the cam bearing surfaces was the case 
itself.  Later in 40HP production VW finally came out with seperate 
replaceable bearings for the cam.  So for a while there were alot of VW 
repair shops that had a bore tool to machine the earlier 40HP engine case to 
accept the later cam bearings.  This tool is also used to rebore the late 
40HP, 1300cc, 1500cc, and 1600cc engines when the bore gets messed up, 
usually due to a crankshaft pounding in the case in it's last death throws.  
This causes the case to give a little and mess up the cam bore.
