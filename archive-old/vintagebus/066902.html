Subject: Re: Heater tubes?

&gt;Any good source for the 'correct' tubes?  My guess is 2&quot; ID on one end
&gt;and 2-1/2&quot; ID on the other end.

Older Buses had 50 mm diameter heater boxes and body tubes while newer
ones are 60 mm diameter.  VW's solution was to use the 60 mm diameter
tubes and an asbestos ring insert which is really likely to be NLA.

Originally there was a flexible metal piece and a muffler piece between
the heater boxes and the body tubes.  The tubes you buy at the FLAPS
today will be plastic, long enough to replace the metal piece and the
muffler, and 60 mm both ends.  Ronnie at Old Volks sells the same tubes
but with one end 50 mm - they aren't &quot;OG&quot; but they do work.  I got a
pair for my '64 with 60 mm heater boxes and 50 mm body tubes.
