Subject: [VB] Cable SpeedVision on VW's last week?


&gt;Did anyone catch Speed Vision some time last week?
&gt;Aparantly, there was a program on that was
&gt;spotlighting the VW.  On the segment about bus's, i am
&gt;told they oped up with a shot of my deluxe at the
&gt;Classic.  I am told that my wife and I are in kicking
&gt;back in the bus in the shot too.
&gt;
&gt;did anyone tape this by any chance?  I would like to
&gt;get ahold of a copy.  I do not have cable so i can not
&gt;catch it on a re-run.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there get this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Matthew
