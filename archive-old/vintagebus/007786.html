Thanks to all of you who sent info on how to find the type2 chat server.  I
didn't realize that I had to connect to a seperate server.  I've since added
it to my server list and ended up having a nice chat with several of you
last night.  Nikki directed me to her web page with her deer inflicted
adventurewagen.  It's a pity shame this happened as it appears it was a real
nice looker before the mishap.

Thanks again...
