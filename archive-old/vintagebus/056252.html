Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel pump question

Inlet is the top one.
Outlet is the bottom.
Opposite of the original.
You need to remove the pushrod and measure it. It has to be 99.5 mm long.
Try taking off the fuel cap. You should have gravity feed to the pump
immediately.



&gt;   I installed a Brosol &quot;alternator style&quot; mechanical
&gt; fuel pump this weekend and can't figure out wich outlet
&gt; is &quot;from tank&quot; and which is &quot;to carb&quot;. I checked the
&gt; archive and idiot book w/ no luck.
&gt;   Old pump was in at the bottom out at top. This new one
&gt; says opposite on box I think (its in spanish). They look
&gt; the same, shouldn't they both work the same? I tried
&gt; running it both ways with no luck.
&gt;   Maybe it needed to be primed first? and how do i tell
&gt; how long the rod should be? My VW guy said the one I had
&gt; was too long but I don't know if this short style is too
&gt; short and causeing the problem (how do I tell, can i
&gt; turn the motor over by hand and measure how much it
&gt; sticks up?)
