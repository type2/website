The last time I did this, I had a machine shop machine the bushing to
fit and then I pressed them in with a C clamp.

Worked fine.

&gt; Yeah, I have funky steering too. I put most of the blame on my swing
&gt; lever bushings, the pin is loose in there like a ... So I bought a
pin
&gt; and bushings kit, but...
&gt;
&gt; 1) Muir says I can get them reamed together by a machine shop and
then
&gt; hammer them in myself, maybe touching them up with a brake cylinder
&gt; hone.
&gt;
&gt; 2) VW (via Bentley) says I should pull the whole front end and get
to
&gt; work using only VW special tool this that and the other one. I don't
&gt; see a speck of dirt on those lab coats so I don't believe they
pulled
&gt; a greasy front beam at all. Just happened to have another one right
&gt; here with all bushings changed... Kinda like a TV cooking show, huh?
&gt; Yeah, right.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Local bug shop says they have to do it for me and it will cost
&gt; about $165. Something about the right sized reamer being hard to get
&gt; hold of. They just jack up the front and work on the beam in place.
&gt;
&gt; I like Muir's answer best, but what do you volks think?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
