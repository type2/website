Perhaps we are talking about David _at_bugjunction?  He's in Florida and got
burned on a title-less Bus from NC is what I think happened.
By the way....in case you don't already know it...his posts to the
vintagebus list re:said title or lack of.._dot_caused him to be removed from
that list.  Something I strongly felt should not have happened!
later
