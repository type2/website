Subject: Re: [VB] 241 walk through/wierd middle seats

Bummer!!!

I still haven't found a 61 full length middle seat for my 61.   I have a nice 
slightly later one with the right colour upholstery, but the bar on the back 
of a 61 seat is different AFAIK. 

 I saw one once

My 1960 15 window, non walkthrough, also takes a 2/3 seat. I learned the
hard way by buying, selling and trading off different years of middle seats
to get the correct 1960 deluxe middle seat to only find that it wouldn't
fit, only had the mounts for a 2/3 (still looking for a 1960 2/3 middle
seat)
