Subject: Re: [VB] Does your bus tow a trailer?

  MANY people have emailed off list wanting to do the same, but no
&gt; &gt; solutions yet.  


What are people realistically willing to pay for a good tow hitch.  A
friend was contemplating making repro ones but said the interest was not
there.  Please P-mail me or to the list.

Thanks.

Steve
