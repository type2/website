I searched the vintagebus registry for '67 year, then copied the model
numbers to Excel and sorted ascending. According to my calcs, the oldest bus
listed is model #247 147 515 (July '67) submitted by Eric Lykens, CA. This
would be only 994 buses away from the number you listed(217 148 459).

Ok, I've wasted enough of my time - back to work!

Ok, so it's late at night and I've got an idea. Actually, I've had this
idea for awhile but now's the time to get it out there and share...Everyone
is always looking for the oldest bus, the prototype, Barndoor number
20-00001 (or whatever!). Why not go the other way and look for the youngest
split? Any of you 67 owners out there ever compare chassis numbers and see
who's is newest?

According to the numbers at www.splitwindow_dot_com we're looking for number
217 148 459 produced in July of 1967. Of course, maybe this is even more of
a waste of time than I first thought...maybe it's sitting in the museum in
Wolfsburg? Anyone know? Anyone care?

Ok...off to bed now!
