Well guys and gals,
the engine is *just* about done...mainly have to stick the fan shroud
back on and fan belt and other little piddly stuff.  I did a lot of
cleaning up on the motor--more than expected while it was out.  While I
had the heads off...I got as much carbon and other build up out of the
combustion chamber and off of the valves as possible...maybe that even
lowered my compression...hehe
When I pulled out the old pushrods and tubes and seals....I didn't like
what I saw.  Older white seals were hard and brittle...so I put in new
red seals :-)  When I first got this bus, the thermostat had exploded
and bent the bracket and cracked it even!  So...I put in a new one...but
failed to realize that it had put a large hole in one of the pushrod
tubes....little oil leak then...just thought it was the seals...no
biggie...right?  wrong.  The tube was bent so much it was rubbing up
against the pusrod and marring it (actually made about 1/2&quot; of it quite
shiny) and probably weakening it and putting little shards of metal into
my oil :-(  So...I fixed all this...and put new pushrod tubes and seals
in...and a new pushrod (used actually...but the same size)  So.. there
is still quite a bit of stuff in my driveway from working on it
today...so I just threw all the tools into the back of the bus, jack in
the garage, and covered the motor with a large packing blanket until
tomorrow afternoon when I get out of school (senior year...finally! only
4 more months!!) so the bus will be up and running again tomorrow.  I
almost forgot how nice it is to work on solid buses...

more tomorrow...maybe

later,
Isaiah

oh yeah...almost forgot.  I put in all new exhaust gaskets....except I
left the old donuts on there...the ones that connect the muffler and
heater box...as I think they're the asbestos type (the come in a few
different flavors i guess)  I think they seal better...haven't had a
problem with them yet.  I don't like the metal-wire ones... they like to
burn out on me for some reason...or not seal... or poke my
fingers...hehe  Anyone have any of these old fiber donut gaskets lying
around?  I'd like to pick some up.  Must be in decent shape of
course....non in pieces or anything.
