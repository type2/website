Subject: Re: [VB] Any Johnny Lightning toy candidates out there?

    They did use my bus picture that we sent them but they reversed it and
cut out the back ground so it is a pretty generic '66 VW SC picture but you
can see some of the interior stickers in the photo so I say look at the
stickers in the bus and the ones in the picture.  See it is my bus.  Since
they used my bus to make the molds for the original toy they sent me 2 cases
of the toys (96) but I think that they only offer a box of 12 now!   Right
now it has a deer dent in it that will be fixed by Pete Lucas in Lincoln.
Nice to have him here in the Midwest as I know of no one else around to even
want to look at the job!  Here is a pic of the dent.
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+120521.jpg I hit the deer
doing less than 10 mph and didn't even knock him down.  It was weird as he
looked at me as I hit him in the butt as he ran from the right to left after
avoiding him the first time when he ran left to right.  If I had safaris I
could of goosed the deer!  I like that.....Goosing the dear!!
Rob

&gt; So if anyone has a nice example of one of the two specific
&gt; years and types of Volkswagen Busses listed below, please contact me at:
&gt; rvwenger_at_comcast_dot_net  , or call 574-243-0467, please leave a message with
a
&gt; number and I will call you back.
&gt;
&gt; 1) 1964, 1965, or 1966 VW &quot;Samba&quot; Bus/21 window Deluxe Sunroof Bus (with
four
&gt; roof windows on each side of the sunroof and four side windows behind the
front doors).            and
&gt; 2) 1964, 1965, or 1966 VW Type 2 Single Cab Pickup (two doors).  Both
these
&gt; types of busses would have the larger and flatter front turn signals than
the earlier Type 2.
&gt; If I remember correctly, Listee Rob Lafoon had his velvet green single-cab
&gt; honored by JL and duplicated (down to the sticker on the back of his Bus)
as a
&gt; toy.  Several other Busses have been done also.  Don't quote me, but I
believe
&gt; that if chosen, J.L. includes a photo of your VW on the packaging, and I
think
&gt; you get a case of &quot;your&quot; toy free.  Anyway, if you have the right VW bus,
and
&gt; you want to see if your Bus might become famous, contact Ron at
&gt; rvwenger_at_comcast_dot_net
