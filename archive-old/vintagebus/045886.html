Has anyone out there had any luck having parts rechromed?  I can't find anyone
who will do my door handles and a few other bits.  I assume they will have to
be done in copper first because of pitting.  Are there any places that you can
send chrome out to through the mail?  How much should I reasonably pay?
Thanks,
