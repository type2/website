Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] R.I.P. 'Rocky Mountain' Motorworks

As someone that lives fairly close to them, I would say they will not be 
missed that much.  I went down there once for a &quot;gotta have now&quot; part 
but that was it.  Their prices were certainly higher than most, even 
with shipping costs.

They were good to deal with though.  The only real question remaining is 
the show they had every year on the Saturday before the Bandimere show 
here in Denver in early August.  It was a campout and attended by many, 
some from this list I suspect.  Anyone picking up the ball on having 
this campout this year?  I was thinking about trying to organize 
something maybe at Red Rocks Park, just up the road from the Bug-In 
show.  Thoughts??
