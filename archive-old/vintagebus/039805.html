Hey All,

Just got a tach put in over the weekend and would like to share my specs and 
confirm I've got a stock big nut tranny.  Bus is a 66 with bignut on 
195/60/15 tires
                         MPH
RPM       1st        2nd         3rd        4th

1500       4                                 24

2000                  14          22         34

2500        8         17          28         42

3000        10         20         35         51

3500        13                    41          60

3800        15        26          44          65


I winded him out to 3800 to confirm my absolute top speed w/ has always been 
65 w/ these tires.  Planning a 500 mile one way trip in march and I have to 
make it cause I'm the best man!  Anyway my bus has never ran hot and I was 
wondering what is that absolute highest RPM to cruise a whole tank on if 
wanting speed and not worried best gas mileage and optimum cooling?  I'm 
confortable with 3500 but am curious if he could handle 3800.  What is RED 
LINE?

Thanks,

Eric
