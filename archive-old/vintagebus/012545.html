&gt; i have an idea to make a four point harness for young children (not
so much
&gt; for toddlers).  it would be used on a bench seat and would wrap
around it so
&gt; that little to no mods are necessary to the car.  it would be great
for all
&gt; classic car enthusiasts who want to preserve therir cars.  i have
already
&gt; given it much thought and have a sketched it up but i will not share
any more
&gt; with any of you because i don't want my idea stolen.
&gt; sorry, but does any one have any information on patents that they
could send
&gt; me or tell me of any web sites to visit.  it would be greatly
appreciated.  i
&gt; have many great ideas for tools and want to know how to protect
them.  not
&gt; long ago i came up with an idea for a screwdriver that had a handle
that could
&gt; be made into more or less a t handle for additional torque.  I just
recently
&gt; saw it for sale.  My dad experimented with ideas for a weed wacker
long before
&gt; they first showed up.  I guess if we should have jumped at the
chance and
&gt; developed these things before someone came up with the idea.

Child safety seats are generally required to be attached through the
existing restraint system, not directly attached to seats, so your
strap-on idea won't work.  How could you ensure that some bozo
wouldn't attached the thing to the non-latching folding front seat of
a '50s 2-door car and proceed to crush their kid.

There is a 4-point child harness that attaches to a lap belt on the
market now, so that idea is gone too.

As far as patent data is concerned, I suppose that you should consult
with a patent attorney.
