Greetings all!

I'm looking for a few items for my '77 Westfalia and my '61 Single Cab.

First, I would like to find a nice set of NOS (could happen) or extremely
nice used bumpers for my Camper.  They are not rusted or dented, but the
original owner put a trailer hitch on the back bumper.

Second.  I was wondering if anyone out there has a clean set of original
windshields for a '61 Single Cab.  I realize that it's just flat glass and
that I could probably find another source.  However, I would like a set of
originals, with logos and all.

If anyone could help, I would greatly appreciate it.  Please e-mail me and
let me know.

Thanks,
Victor
