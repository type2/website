Subject: Re: [VB] fan width

Hi Mike,

For any doghouse cooled engine you MUST use a 33, 34, or  better yet a 35mm 
wide (inside measurement).  You need to use the  largest diameter lower stock 
pulley which almost always has a &quot;D&quot; stamped on  one of the pie shaped 
corrigations of the pulley.  Using a Porsche  356/911 upper pulley increases 
fan speed 
more.  Tach your VW for a  fifteen minute drive to find out where all four 
forward 
gears hit 1,500  &amp; 3,000 RPM at what MPH in each gear.

Ok the fan width I had was 32mm I have obtained a 35mm one, I have  also 
cleaned out a good quarter of an inch of grime a mix of oil and dust from  inside 
the fan housing . I am going to replace the themostat flaps which  the 
previous owner left out. I have a type 4 oil cooler and was wondering  about 
upgrading to this?. I also have to check the fanbelt dimensions as a long  belt will 
make the generator larger diameter in affect causing the fan to turn  slower, 
and I have been using no shims to tension the belt.  Any  more suggestions? Mike
