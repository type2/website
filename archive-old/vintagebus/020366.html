i am thinking about fitting a 205 turbo diesel engine
into my 71 bay, any advice?

here are my questions

1) engine mountings?

2) I've been told they are prone to overheating, does
anybody have any experience?

3)whats the crack with vibrations? is there any?

4) will the existing gear box cope with the increase
in torque?

5) any photos would welcome
