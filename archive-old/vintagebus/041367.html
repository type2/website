Hey Now

   Today I've been in a pretty good mood because I've been chatting with
my co-workers here at my Internal Med clinic about busses.  What I've been
tryin' to do was take the advice of someone who said &quot;if you want to get
that rare find then chat with everyone about busses, something might
strike and you'll get lucky&quot;.  Well, half of the people didn't know what
type of bus I was talking about.  I'd say &quot;early model&quot;, &quot;split
windshield&quot;, and &quot;lot's of windows, esp on top!&quot;.  Occasionally a light
would dawn in the eyes of someone and I'd try to root out from them any
info they might have on who might have a bus(their grandpa, cousin, you
name it).  Mostly it turned out to be loafs they were talkin' about.
They say &quot;oh, his got a really old bus..&quot;  of course, old for most folks
is like 1994.  I'd then say, &quot;NO, really old, like 50's-60's.  One guys
family had a bus in the early 70's but it has long since seen its day.  

So, works been fun today.  Then I go out to lunch and on the way back I
see a nice and lived in black early model bug.  It looked to be a 59 with
pull handles.  I stopped and looked and kept walking.  Then, at this old
hardware store was parked a titan and beige 67 21 walk!  I did a quick
walk around.  It's a seattle bus, you can tell.  The seals were hurting.
It had moss inside the jackpoints(how!?).  It was a bit camperized(with
electrical outlets on the driver side!), but still had the rear seat(no
middle).  Perfect headliner! A tire on the nose and a tad of rust on the
fadded paint.  I went back to work, told a friend about it then went and
dropped off a note, cause you never know.  

ANYWAY---

   I've got an issue with the resto already underway.  I needed to take
out the passenger side belly pan because it had holes and I could tell
there was some rust in there.  When I took it off the frame was rusty, but
fixable(I wired it and I'll soon blast it and POR15 it).  That was just on
the passenger side frame.  When I prepped the driver side rocker
replacement the other frame was just as bad, but again fixable.  Now, I
want to get into the center belly pan, fix the rust and probably the heat
tube and then POR 15 it all.  Which way do I get in there?  I have to fix
half of  the passenger side cargo floor so I wonder if I bought the
halfpeice I would be able to do all the work I need to?  Or should I go under
and take off the pan, which I think would be very difficult?  The rust
needs to be fixed(yea, I'm paranoid about rust, who isn't!?) Why way do I
go in?  

Then, when I get that fixed getting the pans back on will be something of
a task.  I didn't drill out the welds on the frame so there is a bit of
pan stuck to the frame still, I think I grind that down to bare metal then
flange the replacement pans accordingly and that would work as a good bond
for a weld(to what maybe an un weldable frame, I dunno haven't seen
underneath the frame, only the two sides of it.)  Hope I'm making sense
and it sounds like a plan.  Any advice?  

Oh, congrats for me, I've started work again on the bus for the first time
since I almost cut off my arm with the grinder!  Lemme tell you how nervos
I was making my first few cuts again.  Still, the rustaration goes
on(quite well, I'll add).
