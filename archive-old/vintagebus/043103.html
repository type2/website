It has come from Canada...has a model identifier printed/stamped into the
front leading edge of the fibr-glass pop top.  The pop top is somewhat
ridged and is looong.  Almost the entire length of the bus roof.
Everybody is familiar with the dorms and westies and rivieraa and sundials
and etc......not a single person on the list familiar with this one huh?
A &quot;rare&quot; eBay item perhaps?
Good luck in your quest to learn about it Scott!
later

&gt; This 'Hanover' conversion is a new one on me - can anybody shed some light
&gt; on what it is? Never heard of it.
