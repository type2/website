The windshield wiper will work with this arrangement jus fine because the
amperage of the motor doesn't change, therefore you can find a value for the
resistor needed to slow it down.

For the radio, however, a dropping resistor doesn't do the trick because if
you turn the volume control up on the radio, the radio will use more amperage
than if it is quiet.  This makes it impossible to set one value for the
dropping resistor.

There is some really good stuff on this in the archives.

I do ramble! Anyway, I'm wondering about a 6 volt radio. If I installed it
with a voltage drop should it work perfectly? My guess is yes but ..... the
list knows all.
