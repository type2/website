Subject: RE: [VB] more engine tin &amp; now alternator question

Most parts houses will sell a spacer for your carb. I you can't find one you can cut the top off of an old manifold and use it as a spacer. make sure it is flat! That tin has to go period. It looks like aftermarket garbage. What is interseting is how thew raised areas that go around the heat risers are normally rounded, those appear to be cut at an angle. Any wrecking yard that has VW's should have that tin. It's not very sought after so it should be there!
