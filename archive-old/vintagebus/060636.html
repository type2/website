&lt;&lt; A guy who helped me out on my recent cross country trip (with free parts 
BTW) needs some '66 or earlier bug axles.  He has the later longer ones to 
trade...the ones that I think are used in lowering a bus...if any of you out 
there can help him out it would be great.  Call him for the details.  Tell 
him Dan, the guy who broke down in the crew cab sent you.
