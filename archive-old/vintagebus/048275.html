Well, it's like this.  The gas milage did not go up.   The engine area does
smell less gassy.  However, I am worried about several things.

I pulled the spark plugs out the other day (, and the plugs were still lighter
than I would think ideal (a sign perhaps of too LEAN a mixture).  hm.

The bus is feeling sluggier.  Yes I put a higher geared tranny in there, but
my 61 (same gearing, has SP 1600) does not have the sluggy feel to it- in fact
it tends to be peppy.  Now for my 65 Westy it is sometimes hard pulling 3rd up
a hill that I would expect to zoom up.  I do expect not to pull certain hills
in 4th, but slowing in 3rd- that's a bit silly when the hills aren't that
steep and I know I've done that hill happily in 3rd before.

Yup, mine spits some black guck out upon start up too (lets start a club)- has
for a while.

My oil pressure has dropped, so I just switched from 10/40 to 30 wt - though I
had felt 10/40 would be good for winter.  But the oil pressure being lower is
not a good sign.  There was some slime on the oil round plate thing when I
changed it, but no chunks of metal.

It runs cool, though, no sign of overheating at all.

Haven't done a compression test or much diagnositics, though.  Think I'll put
a 30/31 pict carb on it instead of the 34 Pict, as smaller carbs tend to be
more torquey (I really like that word- torquey) and get better milage.   But
the signs are towards a rebuild of an AK case this winter, and putting the
tired (B case) motor in the bug.

 &lt;&lt; My Bus always has this GAS smell, inside and out.  Not sure why but
  everytime I drive it I smell gas, and when I get out I smell like I just got
  done driving a Go-Cart.  Also I started it today and it was backed up to the
  curb and the exhaust pipe was facing the curb.  After I turned it off there
  was black stuff all over the curb, I guess its carbon ?  Any ideas ?  keep
  in mind I'm the new-bee and dont know sh%_at_t

 Hi Jason,
 Do you have the proper carb jets installed for your year VW and engine?  If
so
 did you check all three (and sometimes four) jets to make sure that they
 matched the jet size number on them?  Did this resently for Clara.  When she
 would bring her VW over for us to look at there was a overwhelming over rich
 unburnt fuel cloud behind her bus.  Which was real good at getting a person
 light headed in very little time while working on the engine while it was
 running.  While she had gotten used jets of the correct size according to the
 stamped numbers on them.  All of them were way off due to the wear of
 thousands of gallons of fuel going through them and being drilled by DPOs.
 When rejetted properly the exaust was clean smelling and we will be
interested
 to see how much her MPG has gone up with these changes (Hint,hint Clara....)
