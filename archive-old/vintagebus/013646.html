This would imply the starter itself is unable to turn.  That could be
a wedged bushing on the shaft where it enters the flywheel housing, or
shot bearings, or a broken-off piece (from the bendix, the flywheel,
or whatever) that's locked things up.

I'd pull it, with the expectation of needing to replace it.  Again, a
bench test can tell you lots.
