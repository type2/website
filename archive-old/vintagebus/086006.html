Subject: Re: [T2] getting rid of cut-up VW in California ?

Put an ad on the Samba - you cou probably sell the body and whatever else
and make yourself a few bucks back on it, and also let the rest of it go
to help save other vehicles...I hate to see anything scrapped unless it's
completely trashed...

&gt;  I found a squareback for $150 that I was thinking of taking the motor +
&gt; trans from,plus a few other parts,
&gt; But being in the Peoples Republic I was wondering if there were some weird
&gt; rules that I do not know of concerning scraping a car,
