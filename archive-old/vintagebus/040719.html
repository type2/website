Guy and Gals of the list,
                                    In my many years of auto restoration I would
never hold up a rig without it being sprung. Now if the purpose of yankin the tranny is to rebuild the tranny, fine. Float the boat however
you like. But if you are planning any welding i.e rockers,floors etc, by all means, suspend the rig utilizing the suspension. This allows for the natural effect known as GRAVITY and Metalurgical STRESS.  I use a rotisserie i built for 356's and 911's that attaches to the bumper mounts only for blasting and grinding, u-coating and painting, NOT WELDING.
    Now if you are just rolling the beast around sans trans any variation of the converted dumpster under the bus work fine. And if you have a dirt ( Dooryard they call them in NH) drive, use ATV wheels on your dolly and your creeper too....silly

another newbie flamed by bob
with a 66 Deeluxxxe every-daily driver
and   87 Saab turbo conv. parked since 
and a 69 911 up on the rotiss
and a 1930 REO 1 1/2 ton tomorrow (maybe) :&gt;)
and workin on a new greenhouse too....
