Subject: clutch interchange??

--part1_17f.83e6a8d.2a101877_boundary

I recently purchased a clutch and pressure plate for my 66 Panel 6 volt.  I 
now am in need of the same for my 59 panel 12 volt.  It shouldn't matter in 
the clutch and presssure plate right?  The only diffence would be in the 
flywheel?  I'd hate to have to order another one when I have one with only 10 
miles on the set up I have...Any help?? Thanks in advance..
