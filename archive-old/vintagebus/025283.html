&gt; Hi all-
&gt;
&gt; I was just wondering if there were any list members that are
&gt; going to the &quot;Reggae on the River&quot; concert this august.
&gt; This is supposed to the largest Reggae festival (and party!)
&gt; around (the world).  Its held in Redway, CA (3 hours north
&gt; of San Fran) and happens to be somewhat in my neighborhood
