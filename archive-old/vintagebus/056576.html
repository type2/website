Subject: Original, what does it mean?

Am I the one that's confused? On Everett's site there's a 1964 crew cab for
sale from Georgia.
The owner states: &quot;It was restored about 8 years ago and garage kept since.&quot;
Then in the same paragraph he writes &quot;It's all original and about as nice as
they come.&quot;
As far as I know, &quot;restored&quot; and &quot;original&quot; are contradictory terms.
Or has this changed since I left school?
John Flowers
