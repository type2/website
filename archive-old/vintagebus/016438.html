Ok now you've crossed the line.  You are completely out of good luck credits.  I'd be looking over my shoulder for errant lighting strikes if I were you ;-)

I gotta move to the country.  I want to find something in a barn sometime.  Too many people, and not enough barn where I'm at.

I just got a call from a buddy who found what sounds like a barndoor on a
farm nearby while he was doing a water tank repair.


Now for the potentially good bit. The owner says that we can go in and haul
it away as long as we clean out the the rest of the crap in the shed at the
same time!
