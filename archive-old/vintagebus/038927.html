I have the same problem, and my wheels rub if I turn my wheel to far. I
think we have to disconnect the shaft to the arm below, check the wheel
travel in both directions (I imagine you can make the bus tunr only so far
in ONE direction with this wrong, center the unit, and reconnect the shaft.
I don't beleive removing the wheel will help at all.

OK, sad post of the week.

When driving in a straight line, my steering wheel spokes are at 1 &amp; 7
o'clock.

This really bugs me, but 'cos it is a keyed shaft, I can't see how to
get them to 3&amp;9.

Any ideas?

TIA
Simon.
