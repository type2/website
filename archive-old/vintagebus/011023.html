Subject: Re: [VB]  leaking gas in engine compartment - bad description

Hi Raymond&amp;Lucy,
Does this leak appear only when the engine is off?  It could be that fuel 
leaking from the carb down the outside of the manifold is pooling where you 
think the leak is.  Probably best to get a new center section and install it 
when you tear the engine down to a longblock to retorque and fix/replace 
anything in there.  Then if the leak persists you can install a differant 
carb to see if that does the trick.   Eric&amp;Barb
