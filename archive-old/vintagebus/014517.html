Subject: 1962  bench seat Westy SO 33 pics ????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the only interior pic I can find is 

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/image/dunni-6.jpg

is that the right color wood for the side door panels ? (looks darker than 
the roof panels)

there is no tank under the seat for the water -looks like it was never there

also no ice box on the drivers side rear, just the normal cabinet on the 
passenger side rear........is it missing ? or was that an option ?


any pictures of an original one appreciated.......thanks
