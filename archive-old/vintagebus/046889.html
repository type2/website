&lt;&lt; Oil should certainly reach 220-230 when your engine in warmed up, minimum,

 engine hot. &gt;&gt;
Hi Kaybo,
Defintely not.  160-210 is fine for an operating range.  VW put out 
thermostats with opening ranges of 160-170, to keep the engines at the temp 
as much as possible.  The scummy whitish mayonaise stuff stays away at oil 
temps of 160-180 for us in the fall/winter/early spring temps of 60F or less.
