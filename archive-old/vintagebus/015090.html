Remove what's there.  Then remember to re-grease them per the
recommended intervals, which will keep them from getting exposed to
air.  Can't remember the interval right off, but it's something like
every 1500 or 3000 miles - easiest to do it as part of a tune-up, when
you should be hitting all the lube points anyway.
