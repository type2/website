&gt; Man, it just amazes me how easy it is to PULL THE ENGINE in a vw! When I
&gt; went to work the next day and told them what I did, nobody could believe
&gt; it. &quot;yeh, I pulled my engine last night, fixed my clutch, put it back in,
&gt; and drove it to work this morning&quot;. Bragging Bragging Bragging!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; If you got a VW bus...you gotta brag!

I've had the same fun with mine.
Last time I pulled the engine and trans out as a combo, fixed it and put
everything back in.
Monday water cooler conversation went something like
&quot;how was your weekend&quot;
&quot;got a lot accomplished, had to pull the engine/trans on my truck to fix the
xyzzy&quot;  (i forget what i was working on)
&quot;oh, too bad, that must have killed the whole weekend.&quot;
&quot;no, not really, had everything back together by midafternoon Saturday and was
able to..[fill in what ever it was I was able to do over the remainder of the
weekend]......&quot;

We may get grief for driving these old things, but at times like that, it's lots
of fun to see their reactions.
