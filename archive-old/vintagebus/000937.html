Subject: Looking for wiper arms

Hi folks,

Do any of you have a set of wiper arms you'd like to sell? I haven't had
wipers because someone ripped (literally) them off years ago, breaking the
pivot shafts where they come out of the body. I just replaced the shafts
with new ones from BFY, and now all I need is arms and blades. I can get
refurbished ones from BFY, but thought I'd check the list first. They're for
a '67, but I believe any earlier year will work?

Thanks,

Wilder
