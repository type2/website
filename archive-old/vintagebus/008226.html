Simply put - go with new.  Do you know what rebuilt means?  For GEX it
means, &quot;Spec all the parts.  If anything is within toleraance, leave it
alone (even if it will wear out in 5 miles).  Bead blast the old valves,
grind them, lap them in, and sell as rebuilt.  When the heads pops off one
of the exhaust valves in about 3K miles, remind the customer they bought
&quot;rebuilt&quot; heads.&quot;

The only way to go is new because it will MATCH the parts and the life of
the rest of the engine.  Otherwise, plan on an early rebuild in uder 20,000
miles.

I learned the hard way and will NEVER go with out sourced rebuilt heads.
The ONLY rebuilt heads I would use are ones that I bought new valves and
guides for and did the machine work myself.
