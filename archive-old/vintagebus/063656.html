Subject: Re: [VB] Cooling fan speeds

&gt;   I don't really understand the graphs, but here is a test that someone has
&gt;done on different size cooling fans and pulleys to show air flow. When
&gt;someone deciphers this let us know in laymen terms.



he's saying that, for as much ENGINE HORSEPOWER as you save by using 
a power pulley, you don't get as bad a cooling penalty as it seems 
... so if grabbing a few extra ponies  by not turning your fan as 
fast interests you, it's gonna rob 4% LESS cooling effect than you 
thought - WOOHOO!

other page on the site had some interesting comments re: those 
center-fan aftermarket shrouds....
