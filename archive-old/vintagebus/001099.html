Subject: toy catalog -- have to start over
Date: Fri, 16 Feb 2001 20:41:41 -0600

   I've been trying to catalog all of my VW collectibles, take a picture
with the digital camera, and revamp my website to house them all. Well,
after a lot of time consuming work, my harddrive crashed and it's all gone.
I thought about sending the drive off to a data recovery place. They said it
would be $400 minimum if they could even to it. Plus $100 just to try it.
Seeing as how I've got more time than money, I'll just start from scratch.
   I have a SyQuest drive that I've been trying to get to work properly to
back everything up. But not soon enough. I finally got a reply from SyQuest
on what may fix it, 4 months after my inquiry, but a week too late. Darn the
bad luck.
  Tonight I started spreading everything out in the basement. They range
from tiny Z scale Beetles and Vanagons to a Schwimmwagen that will hold 12
inch GI Joes. I'm up to about 900 pieces with 10 boxes to go. 197 pieces are
the VW micro machines in my VW cookie jar. I've got over 100 Brekina Busses
alone. Plus tons of Hot Wheels and Matchbox, some of which are multiples.
  I think the neatest thing I have is a VW Beetle Jim Beam decanter that
hasn't been opened. Or maybe it's the Marklin Digital HO VW Transport Train
Set, I've got 2 water cooled sets and one air cooled set. Then again the Z
scale VW train set ranks at the top of my favorites too. I'm kind of partial
to trains because you can actually run them. But then again, you can run the
slot cars too...
  After I get everything laid out, I'll take a group picture and put that
up. My wife probably thinks I need therapy. But I imagine it would take
years to get to the VW addiction. :)
