Subject: Re: [VB] Cotter pins

cotter pins, also called split pins are used in various places in your bus.  
It is doubled back on itself.  Used with a castleated nut and the threaded 
part has holes through, the cotter pin is put through the nut and bolt/shaft, 
and then the ends bent over so the pin doesn't fall out.  This to help ensure 
that the nuts wont loosen and fall off.    You know, when you put the rear 
axle nut on- you have to line up the gaps in the nuts with the hole in the 
axle shaft.

 What are the cotter pins? Could someone explain it to me? 
 I hope mine are still there, whatever they are! :)
 I'm sorry but my knowledge of the english technical terms is not very deep.
