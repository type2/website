&gt;guest edited again by Dave Easterwood, giving Tom some help that no one
&gt;else ever cares to give.  It has fallen behind lately, and Tom needs help
&gt;in some way, (he's always asked for help), but perhaps someone can offer
&gt;
Hmmm, I sent NEATO a letter offering to help, got no feedback.  I did get
a response to my question about how to tell when my subscription expired
(which turned out be immediately).

Take that as you will.

I am still available and can use the 'Speak and Spell'
from my EFL training. :)
