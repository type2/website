I've got a engine in my bus that's based on a '75 fuel injection case. One
bad thing is a FI case doesn't allow for a mechanical fuel pump. So you
have to use an electric one. No big deal if you handle it correctly.
Whatever you do, DON&quot;T use the pump that comes with the FI engine. It puts
out WAY too much gas. I put a regulator on my Purlator electric pump and it
seems fine. I also put a kill switch up in the engine compartment. That way
if I'm working on the engine and have the key turned on (engine not
started) The pump doesn't turn on and flood the engine. Also makes a good
security measure. My switch is hidden and I turn it off when I turn the bus
off. Robbers wouldn't get very far on that little bit of gas in the carb. I
also mounted it with rubber washers. This REALLY cuts down on the noise it
makes. (vibrations)

Other than that, I've got a 34Pict3 carb and then engine is great. I've had
race guys tell me they like to use the FI cases for some reason or another.

I had a ''74 SB at one time that WAS NOT FI. Best running engine I've ever
driven. That car was stock and had lots of power and was very fast. I'm a
concervative driver and would often find myself going 90pmh on the highway
before I realized it. The car didn't seem to mind one bit...and in fact
acted like it wanted to go even faster. I don't know if it was the engine,
tranny, or a combination of both. But that car ran like a top and was solid
an fast.

&gt;and that's what I've got. It's a 73 engine. I'm kind of toying with the idea
&gt;of buying this bug that I've seen sitting in the mechanics lot which has an
&gt;FI engine in it. Mechanic does not know how to work AC engines, admitted to
&gt;me myself and poor owner want's to sell non running SB. $500.00 seems too
&gt;high. I want to offer $200, see if it sticks and then somehow work the
&gt;engine into my bus. Can someone give me some feedback on this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the help
&gt;
