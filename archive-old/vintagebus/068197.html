Subject: dillon beach campout

someone asked about the dillon beach campout last week.  i found out
that it'll be held on the &quot;ides of march&quot; weekend - that is
march 14-16.  this information is brought to you by j.p. via sandy
and jethro of the spit bus club.

the dillon beach campout is nice little event put on by the split bus
club whose claim to fame is that they are a club that likes to camp. 
dillon beach is located in scenic marin county (calif.).

cheers,
