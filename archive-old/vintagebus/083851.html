Subject: [VB] Moaning noise

&lt;droaning moaning noise heard when driving at 65-70
(3500-4000+ &lt;rpm)?

I had this noise at about the same rpm and it turned
out to be the cooling fan out of balance.  I pushed a
steel sheet metal clip at various places on the fan
and found a spot where the noise (caused by vibration)
went away.  It was a different noise than the howling
my trans makes at about 50mph.  On another occasion a
piece of cardboard found it's way to the fan and threw
it out of balance.
