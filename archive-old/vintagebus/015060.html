Did anybody have any experience getting title corrected or new title for
title-less bus in Illinois. As you guys know my VIN number on the title
does not match the one on the bus. I was just thinking that perhaps I can
go there and register this title and then just go and complain about the
number mix up when I get my new title. Maybe that would be easier then
getting new one from scratch? Anybody?
