RE:  Media Opportunity - Can you Help?

Good Afternoon-

I realize this is short notice but I had a request and was hoping that you
can help me.

On Monday, January 21, The Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace will be
welcome the Austrian Consulate General and a member of the Austrian Archives
when they bring the Treaty of Westphalia to the Library for a new exhibit we
are unveiling in February.

What we would like to do is invite everyone in the Southland with a
Westphalia Volkswagen to be on hand for a media opportunity that we are
hoping to put together.  I'm contacting you hoping to gain some insight on
who to contact and who probable it would be to pull this off.  I appreciate
any assistance of information you can provide me with.

Thank you,
Arianna Barrios
Director of Communications
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace
