Thanks for the advice Jeff M. - sounds like you really know your stuff.

I went back out and checked things over.  I found the butterflies weren't
going down as far as they could have so I adjusted them - now the engine
just purrs real nice at idle.  It's amazing how easy these carbs make a VW
engine idle. :-)

I did find another problem.  Removing the plug wires from 1 &amp; 2 did nothing
as well so it appears I was running from the 3 and 4 side only.  I'll have
to check for spark like you said.  Also it appears it would be smart to
double check and see that I didn't get the plug wires crossed on that side.
Now I'm beginning to believe my guage.

I'll work on it more tomorrow.
