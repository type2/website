Subject: Spot Weld Thanks / Plasma prices?
Message-ID: &lt;36DD45AC.8880BE1E_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

    Just a big thanks to everyone who responded to my spot weld cutter
question.  Once again this list is more help than a thousand dumb ass
counter jockeys!!

Here is another question.  What's the lowest price anyone has found on a
small (30 amp) plasma cutter.  About $700.00 (new/ no name brand) is the
best I've been able to come up with.  Any one have a line on a less
expensive unit??

Thanks.


Steve
