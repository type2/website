&gt; and how fast were you driving? (I understand the typo- 3300-3400 rpm at 60)

&gt;   I have found the best cooling rpm is 2600-2800
well, i was trying to go 60, (actually i double checked tonight 60 is
3100-3200 55 is about 28-2900)

But... going 55 _at_ 2900 in the 98 degree desert heat on the flat road got
me up to 260 degrees right quick... had to back down to 50 MPH at probably
25-2600 or so.

&gt; hm, wonder why  DPs always crapped out on me?
maybe SP is the answer, but my dual port in my 71 works fine, the dual
port in my 61 splitty (the engine in question) overheats like a crazy
person. i dont get it, the main differences are the 71 is .20 over and the
61 is .60 over on the line bore, the 61 has a non stock oil pressure
relief spring and of course the 1641 p&amp;c.

peas,

Steve
