Subject: WTD Brake Light Decklid/ 57 status
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Someone on the list had a brake light decklid for sale.  You still out there? 
 

Finaly took all the door panels out and wow!  Ok i found an old nudie pic of 
some girl and on the back someone wrote something on it in 
German....interesting.  Also found some newspaper scraps but are not legible 
due to rotting.  Anyone know a really good way to clean the vinyl?  What 
about cleaning and preserving the rear mat?  Thanks!
