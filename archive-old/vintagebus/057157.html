Subject: Ellis Cancels BYOB/KP trip! =(

It is with *much* regret that I must cancel my much anticipated plans to attend
the Red Barn and Kelly Park shows. The next 48 hours will tell if there is a
ice cube's chance that I may make the run.

Contact me privately if you or any client may be interested in the 1967 SO42
Westfalia which is for sale. Delivery is still possible with prior purchase.

At this point it is virtually impossible for me to attend. Maybe next time,
maybe at the OCTO Classic.
Thanks,
Jim Ellis
