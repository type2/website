First a correction - our bus is 60 mph at 3500

then a question-
Example 6 matches our RPM and speed with correction for tire size but this is
not what we thought we had.  We thought we should have had the post-63 swing
axle gearing, like example 5.

Does having the big nut tranny, mean we can only have a 1.39 redux box??

We need to do some more work to figure this out - number crunching - engineer's
paradise.

&gt; &gt;my 61 had big nuts, 205 75 15 tires too, and did 3,000 rpms at 58mph.
&gt; When I
&gt; &gt;took the tranny out I want to count teeth, it was a 4.37 r&amp;p(35 ring
&gt; teeth, 8
&gt; &gt;pinion teeth) Stock gears.  how did that happen?   math don't work, tell me
&gt; &gt;real life.
&gt;
&gt; Ex.  4th gear   ring &amp; pinion   red. ratio  rpm    speed
&gt; 5    0.82       4.375           1.26        3500   61.1 mph
&gt; 6    0.82       4.125           1.39        3500   58.7 mph
&gt; Ex.5 =    bus 4th, 4.37 R&amp;P, 1964-67 reduction boxes
&gt; Ex.6 =    bus 4th, 4.12 R&amp;P, 1955-63 reduction boxes
&gt; Ex.5 is stock for a 1964-67 bus
&gt; Ex.6 is stock for a 1955-63 bus
