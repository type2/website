Subject: Big Sur

I have a friend who's coming up for BYOB a little early and is looking for places to crash on Highway1. Is there a large CHP presense there that won't allow that or a mile marker that is a good spot? He's looking for more of a non-paying campground type area than a state park kind of area. Thanks.
