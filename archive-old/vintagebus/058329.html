Ah, there's the rub. I knew from my high voltage tester that it was 4,000
volts lower but drew a lot of current. I could probably still use it on the
start-uo stand with an external ballest resistor tacked on.

&gt; I've noticed that with the ads for the Bosch Blue coil. If you see one for
&gt; under $20 then its probably the cheap Mexican imitation with low output

&gt; since they stopped making them in Germany years ago when everything went
HEI
&gt; ignition.

The cheap one doesn't have a ballast resistor built in so probably not
good for points.
