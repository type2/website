Well with the house move over, I used my new driveway to find out why I've
only been getting gas from the tank with the lever in the reserve position.
This problem surfaced two weeks back after I had the engine and fuel tank
out for a clean up.

When I got the valve out from the bottom of the tank, the problem was self
evident. Of the two spouts that protrude into the tank, the longer spout at
its upper end passes through a cork plug. It would seem that when I was
assembling the valve, seve and two way nut, I must have lost the alignment
and the end of the spout was pushed into the cork spacer and not through the
centre hole. So the spout was blocked. Had I taken an air hose to it, I
might have just pushed the cork up a bit but it might still have not allowed
clear passage of fuel and given hesitation symptoms that would have driven
me mad.
So I hang my head in shame at the realization that it was my faulty
craftsmanship that was the source of the problem. If you're ever there, pay
attention to the reassembly of this little cork spacer.
