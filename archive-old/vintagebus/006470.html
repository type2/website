for those that are interested the pic's are up  for the church bus, as you
see the only visable rust is on passenger side floor and the rear cargo area
this is very minimal and would clean up very easy  this is the original
paint and i have all parts to complete.   jailbars, long moulding,
windshields, wing vent glass,  pop-out;s and latchs. there is no middle seat
and the rear base  only is there, all interior panels are there, and 3
beauty rings  the engine is complete and original as is the rest of the bus.
brakes all work but i would redo them as the bus sat 22 years repair engine
and drive as is or restore and have a 18,.000 dollar bus
