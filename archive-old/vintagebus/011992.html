Subject: BUSES by the BRIDGE I I I
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

this is a question that has come up
we have been talking about getting the free charter bus going to LAUGHLIN&lt; NEV to come by CRAZY HORSE (the shows site) to pick up people on FRIDAY night to go to LAUGHLIN, this includes free buffet, r/t transport, and about 5 hours
in LAUGHLIN (like LAS VEGAS)and other spiffs
so if all you people arriving friday in your
buses after driving who knows how many hours
to come to BUSES by the BRIDGE I I I  would be 
interested in this please email me or vwhoward_at_
ctaz_dot_com and let us know, so that we can make the arrangements, also BEST CAMP SET-UP cash award and trophy, so start thinking about spruceing up the ol camp, watch for more postings on BBB III
and hopefully a link to a web site for all info and updates on BBB III and other upcoming events.

thanks you
ronnie   BBB III january 22-24, 1999
