Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse additional oil cooler or not ?

Dan,

The full flow on my 70 bus was done per Bill Fisher's 70's book &quot;How to
Hotrod Your VW&quot;. A bit of work the first time. Not so bad with the new case
I installed last year. Lots of fun getting the correct fittings to clear
everything. Had to cut the tin near the pulley a little bit. The cooler
hangs from the top of the engine bay. Send you some pics if you like.

 That's a tempting item to buy. So, they are not designed to operate with 
stock mufflers? Seems odd. When you say the neck I assume you are talking 
about the section that projects out from the cover and then leads to the 
base of the oil filter?

 Claude's Buggies so far, makes the only decent present day oil filter/pump:

 To work with our engines with stock muffler we have to cut the neck of the
 cover, angle it down slightly, weld back together, and redrill the oil
 passages back out. Result is no hoses to go bad.
