Subject: RE: [VB] soldering fuse box

I thought I remember you telling me this, if the fuse box soldering doesn't
work, I will try that option next...and probably ask you then exactly how to
do that...i am not sure exactly how to install a relay for the switch.

Thanks

Subject: RE: [VB] soldering fuse box

Kevin, Years ago I had a 65 bug with a 6V 40hp. I got tired of my dim lights
so I bought a switch and a 6 volt relay with 20 amp contacts. I then ran
power to the switch from wire 15 and then to the relay to ground. I ran a
#10 wire from the battery positive to the relay 20 amp contacts and then to
the headlights. My lights were MUCH brighter.

Back to 6V problems again...i have never solved this to any
satisfaction...my headlights are still extra dim. I cleaned every connection

Any suggestions appreciated...

Thanks
