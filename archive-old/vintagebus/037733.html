met lots of listee's, but next time i will put out a &quot;hey i'm on vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&quot; met some cool guys with a &quot;from way up nort eh&quot; accent. Even more so than my Minesooootan girl friend.

anyway had a great time, left with more parts and more money than when i started so i guess the swap was good to me. A nice mosquito net and curtain clips from plf and some little clips for the pre-heat tube from Clara,

btw, Clara I have the correct tool for intsalling these Hazet 798, oh ya, that right you don't &quot;beleeeeve in Hazet&quot; just funnin you, I'll bring them along the next time and show them to you, they are cool and i had no idea what they were for before yesterday.

always amazed how cheap people dump parts for at the end, examples, really nice 67 bus interior mirror for.50 cents, free 6v bus wiper moters, 1 dollar for a working 66-67 bug turn single switch ect...still have one of the 27mm Hazet wrenches for the front wheel bearings and one of the tool kit lug wrenches for sale if your interested....

promted the Jurassic Bug-In

entered my bus in the show, ended up with a second place trohpy, not much bus competition as there were only 3 busses in the show. lots of lowered bugs.

we all stayed at a really nice bed and breakfast, nice folks let me wash the bugs off, and also let jack camp in the yard and fed him breakfast.

also wittnessed jack maynard doing karaoke to zappa's &quot;dirty love&quot; at some cowboy bar.

enjoyed the drive to and from, thanks to those of you who helped put on the event was one of the busiest that i'd been too.
