&gt; The freaking nerve. westfailure - dot - org. You have absolutely no idea
&gt; what running a Westfailure as a non-profit organism is all about baby. The
&gt; Westfailure is mine and she's a heavy eater. Never really had a domain named
&gt; after my bus before, and I suppose I should be flattered but it's giving me
&gt; the wind something fierce. Westfailure_dot_net my ass.
Well, Kyle,

If you would get over being full of yourself, I didnt name my domain after
your bus. I first saw the term wesfailure many years ago.  It was on
the back of a rusted out panel from Wisconsin... and I have seen it
elsewhere (on westies instead of the standard westfalia badge.) I have
been on the internet lists since the vanagon list covered all 3 of the
current lists and only started seeing your name related to the term
westfailure within the last year or two. I figured you might be upset, but
then I also figured you didn't have the term first or exclusively as far
as I am concerned, So, wether you got upset or not was not important. 

Westfailure is also an economic term about the failure of a certain
economic model, and speaks to me about the dichotomy between people
thinking one is a failure for driving a rusty old bus and the fact that
those same people may be a failure in terms not related to material things
(happiness, stability etc.) Additionally it speaks to failures of the
&quot;western&quot; system of politics and greed, but I digress.

I am sorry if my choice of domain names is not to your liking, but I do
not feel I have done anything wrong since you, as I, have attempted to
take a common term and apply it to a new area.

Take care,

Steve
