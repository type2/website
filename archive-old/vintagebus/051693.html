Subject: RE: [VB] Need for speed - limit

I have come to realize this.:

People will ALWAYS feel the need to pass VW's.  It is a inner voice that
tells them that if they Don't pass, then THEY must be the one going slow.
**I mean BEHIND a VW?  Come on now, my car is faster than that!...**  I have
fun once in a while preventing them from doing so.(Read as: Custom)

Little do they know, behind a vintage car is the safest place to be!(Read
as: Brakes) ; )

Y'know, I have a stock bus which I drive at about 58MPH.  I don't feel
terribly unsafe on freeways and I really don't care if some random trucker
gets upset at having to change lanes to pass me.  They need _something_ to
gripe about or they won't have anything with whichto cuss at each other
over the CB.

I prefer the side roads, but I'm not going to stop using the freeways
because I don't run the speed limit.  The speed limit is a maximum, not
the only speed you can run.
