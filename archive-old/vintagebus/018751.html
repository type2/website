&gt;I am sorry if my relating a personal experience and
&gt;observation along with a question wasn't scientific
&gt;enough to not piss you off.

I am not pissed off, just annoyed by what seems to
me to be a flaw in your logic.  I do not have the
full text of your original post -- I only have the
portion I quoted in my reply.  If you or anyone
else would like to re-send that complete post to
me, I would appreciate it.

The part I quoted was as follows:

&gt;Date: Fri, 22 Dec 2000 18:10:26 EST

&gt;
&gt;I had a '74 D_at_tsun B-210 that I bought new in '73.
&gt;Along about '77 or so, the original carb went bad
&gt;and the dealer wanted too much for a new one.  
&gt;[...] I installed everything, capped off all the 
&gt;unused vacuum tubes and wires and managed to get
&gt;it all to run well enough to get it to a dyno-tuner
&gt;that was recommended by the place I bought the carb.  
&gt;Once it was dyno-tuned, I swear, my gas mileage went
&gt;from 27 to 35 around town, 45 on the highway.  I 
&gt;don't remember the exact horsepower ratings before
&gt;and after, but I do remember an increase of around
&gt;20% or so.

To me, this implies that the new carb was the sole
source of your mileage improvements.  My point was
that you did not have enough information to draw
this conclusion -- at a minimum you would have had
to purchase a new, stock Datsun carburetor, install
it, and have the car dyno-tuned by the same shop.

Again, the complete post may read differently.  I
will gladly revisit my statements once I have a
copy.

&gt;As for whether or not getting better mileage from any
&gt;vehicle, bus or otherwise, is a waste if time, energy,
&gt;and money, that's a matter of opinion.

I never said that it wasn't a matter of opinion.

&gt;You have made your opinion ridiculously clear.

Thank you.  In the future I shall strive to
express my opinion less clearly, for your benefit.
