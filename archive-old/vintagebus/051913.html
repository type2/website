Subject: Front steering

OH BOY,
I was soooo smart. I had it all figured out that my tie rod ends were loose
as a goose and replaceing them would give me back my steering. Trouble is, I
can't remember what it was that led me to believe it was the tie rods.
Anyway, I order all four tie rod ends and an extractor. Saturday night I
push my trike project out of the way and jack up the truck. When I got under
there my tie rod ends were as tight as anyone could expect. So what was
causing this 3/4 steering wheel slop from side to side? I started rocking
the wheels back and forth and then I saw it. The drag link ends were totally
shot. That was where all my play in the steering wheel was coming from.
Well, another $35 including shipping. I guess when I pull the front end down
to redo the torsion bars and seals, ect. I will replace the tie rod ends
then.
