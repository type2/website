&gt; &gt;Not sure what the list etiquette is about re posting others stuff, but
&gt; &gt;people should know that this was originally posted in the Wolfsburg West
&gt; &gt;e-news letter.  Just wanted to set the record straight.  I'm sure it was
&gt; &gt;just an oversight by the person posting it.

FYI,

this was originally posted on an internet newsgroup at least a month ago,
maybe more.  rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled....  it is also on the authors
website.  I have no idea how this relates to copyrights, but though it was
worth mentioning that it has been around in public forums other than the
list mentioned.

peas,

Steve
