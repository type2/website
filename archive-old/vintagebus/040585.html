Thanks for your responses on my stuck shift rod coupling.  Plan to attack
tomorrow.  

Now my original problem: the nose cone studs on the tranny have all but
one stripped out of the tranny.  Very strange, I believe the PO did a
VERY poor job of putting the tranny in, even securely bolting the nose
cone on, and  I'm now paying the price for my lack of a thorough job
checking it out. (A week of sloppy shifting, then stuck in gear, Ugh.)
Regardless, can't seem to find 11mm helicoils ANYWHERE, and wondered how
sacreligious it would be to tap in an SAE stud instead.  It pains me to
suggest, but I need it on the road!  Suggestions are much appreciated. 
By the way, I'm using my home email account right now, I'm AKA Adam
Crosier if that doesn't pop up on the header.  Thanks!
