&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the lengthy post!!
&gt; 
&gt; Here is information regarding BBtB.  As you can see
&gt; we
&gt; have been working very hard at putting together a
&gt; fun
&gt; filled, relaxing weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; This year we will be invading the wonderful town of
&gt; Brunswick.  The dates are September 14,15 and 16th.
&gt; We will be hosting Busses by the Buoy at Thomas
&gt; Point
&gt; Beach in Bruinswick, Maine.
&gt; Directions are as follows:
&gt; FROM THE SOUTH:
&gt; Exit 9 off Interstate 95 to Brunswick.
&gt; FROM THE NORTH:
&gt; Exit 24 off Interstate 95 (Topsham) to Brunswick.
&gt; IN BRUNSWICK, take Rt.1 to Cook's Corner, BNAS,
&gt; Islands-Exit (Rt.24) straight. Just off Rt.24.
&gt; Follow
&gt; signs, only three more miles!
&gt; 
&gt; Please call them and let them know you would like to
&gt; reserve a spot.  The number is (207) 725-6009.  If
&gt; you
&gt; have never been there, it is rather large and there
&gt; are numerous things for people to do.  I have
&gt; personally tried out the slides on the playground
&gt; and
&gt; let me tell you they are fast!  I would suggest
&gt; bringing an extra extension cord.   The electrical
&gt; hookups are far between.  But, there is electricity.
&gt; I remember a few years ago, electricity wasn’t even
&gt; a
&gt; problem.  No one wanted electricity.  My how times
&gt; have changed.  Now I need my microwave and laptop
&gt; computer, not to mention my hairdryer to blow-dry
&gt; what
&gt; hair I have left!!   In the brochure, it says pets
&gt; are
&gt; not allowed.  Please disregard that, as we are
&gt; allowed
&gt; to bring pets.
&gt; 
&gt; We have a great weekend planned or not planned
&gt; depends
&gt; on what your idea of a vacation is.  There is a
&gt; rumor
&gt; flying around on vanagon_dot_com about a sailboat coming
&gt; up for the weekend.  Anyone for day cruises?   For
&gt; you
&gt; consumers, Freeport and the home of LL Bean is right
&gt; next door.  Who needs some retail therapy??
&gt; 
&gt; The lobster dinner will be the same as last year.
&gt; Same folks.  Please let us know as soon as possible
&gt; at
&gt; the campground if you want lobster.  Kathy Haynes
&gt; will
&gt; be the lobster captain as in years past!!  Yeah
&gt; Kathy!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Ben &amp; Jerry’s has once again donated ice cream.  Who
&gt; wants to scoop ice cream?  I think this year I will
&gt; enlist the help of Dave Wallace.  Not only is he
&gt; printing our shirts for the weekend, he will be
&gt; scooping our ice cream.  I like teams, so why not
&gt; have
&gt; Roger Plante help Dave scoop?  Roger designed the
&gt; shirts!!
&gt; 
&gt; I have been on the phone with tons of Volkswagon
&gt; related vendors and this years raffle should be just
&gt; as good as last years, if not better!!!  I have a
&gt; tent
&gt; from Eurocampers_dot_com, an awning from Equinox, a
&gt; towing
&gt; hitch from Dennis Haynes, gift certificates from the
&gt; Bus Depot, Van-Again, PLF, rocky Mountain
&gt; Motorworks,
&gt; $200 off an engine from Tiico, something from
&gt; Fiamma,
&gt; wonderful dinner with me!!! and catalogs from every
&gt; person you could think of.  Tickets are $1.00 each.
&gt; 
&gt; We will be having the potluck breakfast again and
&gt; this
&gt; year Bill Kaehrle from Ct will be the breakfast
&gt; captain.  Good luck and welcome aboard.  This is his
&gt; first year and he wanted to be involved.  Lets hope
&gt; he
&gt; comes back next year!!  These are the items that he
&gt; is
&gt; looking for.  I can’t wait for breakfast!!
&gt; baked goods
&gt; fruit medleys
&gt; breakfast meat items (including hash of course)
&gt; charcoal grill station for meat items (ham/sausage)
&gt; ?
&gt; egg dishes
&gt; other main dishes incl. veggie/soy choices
&gt; omelet station setups – pans - stoves
&gt; omelet station food prep items
&gt; chafing dishes and sterno
&gt; juice
&gt; coffee, coffee station fixings
&gt; please contact Bill _at_ highrpm_at_home_dot_com or just stop
&gt; by
&gt; and see him at the campground.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The lineup for the weekend is as follows:
