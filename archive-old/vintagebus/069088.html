Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny replacement project update (long)

I highly agree with VeeWee's instructions, having done this the same way.
I would add that you can buy a bunch of the side gaskets cheaply (Long
Enterprises, etc), and also here's an additional note on their
installation that has saved me lots of hassle:

You generally use 3 gaskets, but depending on the fit, 2 might be all
necessary - you figure that out by the way the axles fall when all is
assembled. You assemble first without dabbing the hi-temp silicone goop
and check the fall-fit. They should fall freely, and not stick. I found
that one gasket can be the difference between free fall and sticking, so
do what's necessary to get this right.

Other thing here is that you should make a nice slant-cut thru each
gasket so you can loop them
around the axle during your final fit-check and final gooping and
installing. It allows you to add and remove gaskets easily to get the fit
right, *with* the axle in place.

After you've determined how many you need, you goop them with
the hi-temp silicone, both sides, them loop them around the axle onto the
studs. Place the slit at the top so it couldn't possibly leak (with all
the silicone, it won't anyway).

Basically, slitting the gaskets is my contribution here to an already very
good procedure by VeeWee, inc.

&gt; You can just use paper gaskets you make at home.  Getting the right amount of
&gt; these gaskets on each side is important.  Dry fit them in and you want the
&gt; axle tube to freely travel up and down but with no in out slop to them.  When
&gt; we install these gaskets and RGB axle tubes for the final time we finger
&gt; paint the gaskets with high temp silicon to insure complete sealing in this
&gt; area.
