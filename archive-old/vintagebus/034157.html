Subject: [VB] Front end squeaks Q


Hi list,

I have some tricky squeaks towards the front of my '60 Dcab. I have
completely lubed all zerk fitted points on the beam with the wheels in the
air and the noises remain. They are intermitent and I don't seem to be able
to get the squeaks to happen when the vehicle is stationary. I have tried to
cause the noises by bouncing up and down in the seat without success(I weigh
120kg so the bus was certainly well bounced).

Can anyone suggest stuff to look at?   

TIA 

Michael
