&lt;&lt; Any body on the list know if one of the vendors has
 a complete kit to refurb the reduction boxes and axle
 tubes from the tranny side covers out?  &gt;&gt;

I don't have or know of anyone who makes a kit such as
this.  If there is enough interest I could put together a
parts and price list for both the 36mm'd and 46mm'd
nutted redux boxes.  Just post me a note off-list and
depending on how much traffic I get I will either post
directly back or make a 'general' broadcast.
