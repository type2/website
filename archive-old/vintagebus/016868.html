I bought a bus steering lock and found out that the ignition switch is 
broken and unfixable(I even tried to TIG it). Does anybody have a unit with 
a good ignition switch(possibly with a key) that they want to part with? I 
have everything else in good shape including the electrical and I would love 
to use this for what it is intended.
