Subject: Re: [VB] Re: prepping sump plates gaskets and a punt

I have the same opinion of Curil T as Eric. Discovered it about 6 years ago 
when rebuilding an old 356 Porsche engine (glorified VW) at a Porsche shop. 
Haven't used Permatex or Gasgacinch since. Curil T has all the great removal 
and sealing qualities Eric describes. I think of the many hours scraping off 
Aviation Permatex I'd have avoided if I had discovered Curil T fifty years 
ago.

  I used to use the Permatex Aviation
stuff, but cleaning it off between teardowns was rediculous.

 which was the reason i was looking for other options; gasgacinch
 would leave big chunks of hardened goo/cardboard mix welded to the
 screen and case, requiring scraping.  3H wouldn't completely come off
 without lots of elbow grease. i don't use rtv on anything but the
 base of cylinders sometimes.  decided to try the silicone gaskets,
 since they kill 2 birds with one stone (no more sealants OR gaskets
 to buy). IF they work :)
