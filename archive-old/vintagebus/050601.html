Subject: RE: [VB] 36 hp heater boxes/hi temp paint

Go to your local fab/weld shop and they should be able to make them for next to nothing.If you ask nicely they probably have stainless too.I had a pair done for $50 in stainless this included new flanges too.

hoping someone knows where to get the replacement j tubes for 36 hp heater boxes. also, is there something other than hi temp paint I can use on them and the muffler? would powder coating work?
