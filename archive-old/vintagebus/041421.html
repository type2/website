I agree with this.  Never try to break in a cam with double valve
springs.  It's amazing to me how much extra
pressure is generated by them.  The first time I tried turning my engine
over with the wrench after installing the heads, I was really suprised.
I had the inner springs removed and will leave it that way I think.
