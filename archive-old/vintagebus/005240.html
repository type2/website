Hello everyone, My new to me crew cab has some serious electrical problems.
The factory harness does not appear to have been hacked really, there is
just alot of stuff unplugged. It has a standard relay, but I see no &quot;black
box&quot;. Should I have one? It is a 63 model that has been converted to 12v.
I'm ready to spring for the Bentley manual, where do I buy one? Can I look
at my 67 Westy and copy the wiring? My buddy has a 63 SC, can I rob the
&quot;black box&quot; from it or does it need to be a 12v model? Thanks once again!
