That's the one... except I had a shot from the front with an NOS chicken
strolling by the front wheel. Used it a Christmas card and got in the Hot
VW's Xmas card review that year!! Some fellow from New York bought the '48
is what I had heard.

I've believe I shot a full roll and still have them in my albums. Friend of
mine scored some parts, but I just took the pictures as the rust hold on
most of these vehicles was severe.

Used to go to Ontario in the summer to the family cottage, which is how I
got to Mr. Chipps place. Live in Manitoba.

&gt; Hi Barb and Scott
&gt; Are you refering to the beetle in  this picture?
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcollie/junkyard_jpg/junk10.jpg
&gt;
&gt; I have not talked to John since November... But I think he is still
kicking!
&gt;
&gt; Do you still have pics?  Are you still in the neighborhood?

&gt; &gt; I took some pictures of these 2 buses in the mid '80s plus a pile more
of
&gt; &gt; the old yard when the '48 Beetle was there...Also used to be a '50 panel
as
&gt; &gt; well. Is Mr. Chipps still alive?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just uploaded a couple of interesting pictures
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2172.JPG
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of you may have seen this picture before,, but I thought it was
worth
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking at again, with the interest in Barn Doors
&gt; &gt; &gt; I wish I had taken an interest to that Bus, when I had the chance to
get
&gt; &gt; it!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And another Bus that is still for sale afaik, alot of you older guys
will
&gt; &gt; know
&gt; &gt; &gt; it as it has been discussed before ,, long time ago..
&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it out..
