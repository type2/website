Subject: Re: [VB] OVWC Show

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just got home.  Had to leave the show immediately at judging time but
they
were nice enough to do the Saddest Body award first because I had to
leave.
Yep, I won it.!!!  YEAH BABY!   I've placed 2 years now with my POS 1967
bus.  Took 3rd last year in the VW bus special olympics.  :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;

[grin] when I just got to the I won it and yeah baby part I was thinking
it was for 'your' body. I was impressed with your unflappable self esteem.
Then I saw they were picking on your bus. grrrr.
ha ha.
