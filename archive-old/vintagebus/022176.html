&gt;my 61 had big nuts, 205 75 15 tires too, and did 3,000 rpms at 58mph.
When I 
&gt;took the tranny out I want to count teeth, it was a 4.37 r&amp;p(35 ring
teeth, 8 
&gt;pinion teeth) Stock gears.  how did that happen?   math don't work, tell me 
&gt;real life.

Well, we are talking about swingaxle reduction box VW bus transaxles...

People go out &amp; buy a &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; tranny and wonder why they don't 
go much faster than their original tranny...  There are 2 ways to build 
a &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot;:  you do it correctly with a taller ring &amp; pinion, or 
you do it with a taller 4th gear.  If you do it with a taller R&amp;P, you 
retain the same 1st-4th gears and their spacing.  If you do it with a 
taller 4th gear, the rpm range between 3rd &amp; 4th changes &amp; when you are 
climbing that big hill &amp; drop to 3rd, you have to slow down even more 
to keep your engine from racing.

Here's where the big lie part comes in...  If you buy a cheap &quot;Freeway 
Flyer&quot; for your bus and do not specify a bus 4th gear, guess what you 
get?  A beetle tranny with a flipped differential, which means that 
with a beetle 4th gear, is not much better than the original bus tranny.
Most bus trannys have keyed pinion shafts &amp; most beetle trannys have 
splined pinion shafts.  To use a bus 4th gear with a beetle pinion 
shaft requires machine work that you will not get with a cheap tranny.

Here is an example of the calculations (assuming 26.5&quot; diameter tires):

Ex.  4th gear   ring &amp; pinion   red. ratio  rpm    speed
1    0.82       3.875           1.26        3500   68.9 mph
2    0.82       4.125		1.26        3500   64.8 mph
3    0.82       3.875           1.39        3500   62.5 mph
4    0.89       3.875           1.26        3500   63.5 mph
5    0.82       4.375           1.26        3500   61.1 mph
6    0.82       4.125           1.39        3500   58.7 mph
7    0.89       3.875           1.39        3500   57.6 mph
8    0.82       4.375           1.39        3500   55.4 mph

Ex.1 =    bus 4th, 3.88 R&amp;P, 1964-67 reduction boxes
Ex.2 =    bus 4th, 4.12 R&amp;P, 1964-67 reduction boxes
Ex.3 =    bus 4th, 3.88 R&amp;P, 1955-63 reduction boxes
Ex.4 = beetle 4th, 3.88 R&amp;P, 1964-67 reduction boxes
Ex.5 =    bus 4th, 4.37 R&amp;P, 1964-67 reduction boxes
Ex.6 =    bus 4th, 4.12 R&amp;P, 1955-63 reduction boxes
Ex.7 = beetle 4th, 3.88 R&amp;P, 1955-63 reduction boxes
Ex.8 =    bus 4th, 4.37 R&amp;P, 1955-63 reduction boxes

Ex.5 is stock for a 1964-67 bus
Ex.6 is stock for a 1955-63 bus
