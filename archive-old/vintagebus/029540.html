Subject: Generator/Maaco

Well, I took my 65 bus to Maaco one week ago, said it would be done last
Saturday.  As of yesterday they hadn't started yet.  So I picked it up
and am painting it myself at the local hot rod club paint booth.  Only
problem now is that there is NOW an electrical problem- here are the
facts:

1. Told them to turn the ignition switch off if they ever ran it-they
didn't and ran out the battery.
2. They 'recharged' the battery without re-charging it and gave it back
w/ the battery dead.
3. Had them jump the bus, started, ran, but engine just went completely
dead after one mile...
4. Recharged the battery myself overnight-starts fine now.
5. Generator light is now on and bright.
6. Its a one-year old generator and regulator.

What's the most likely candidate here?  Regulator?  Generator?
