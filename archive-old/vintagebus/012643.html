Or, you have the ultra-super-rare, one-day only, center brakelight lid
with a locking handle instead of a church key.  I like this setup much better,
correctness aside.  In the horrific event that I had a fire, I could open the lid much faster!  Of course the handle would probably be hot, but at least
I&quot;m not looking all over for a church key!

&gt; &gt;Looks identical to a 58` decklid,but has pushbutton instead of churchkey??????
&gt; Sounds like a Brazilian part -- the Brazilian splitties (built until 1976!)
&gt; had the flat-style engine cover, but without the centre brake light. This
&gt; style was fitted to German buses only for the US mnarket in 1958. The
&gt; Brazilian engine cover has the 67-style push-button latch
