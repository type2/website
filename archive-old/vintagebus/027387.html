Does anybody have experience with 195/75/15 on a '67 tranny? ('61 beater
with 15&quot; rims) This size came highly recommended by a list member but
now I's seeing a lot of references to 205s. I must replace the current
215s due to excessive wear (that's another story.....) With the 215s my
speedo reads about 5 mph too high and ride is a little skwooshy (perhaps
due to height?)
