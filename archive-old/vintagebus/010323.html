Well after the first trip a week ago , i pulled out the engine , looked at
the sloppy rod and sent it away on a pallate, as my 66 13 window is my main
ride, being that its the coolest vehicle ever made, i decided to splurge and
buy a brand new engine. Cool thing was  a few years ago, someone
mysteriously dropped off a pancake in my driveway with all the tin and fuel
injection stuff, and i got a good discount for the 2 cores.  The uncool
thing was that all of a sudden my $600 seal order, $400 spindles and $1100
engine are all ready at the same time, ouch. Well anyway its worth it, but i
had planned to replace the muffler before the engine, and the heater boxes.
The problem is that ive been using an extractor exhaust that i robbed off a
71 baja that i bought for $50 with a big nasty dual muffler setup from jc
wimpy(which by the way was black when i bought it and all the paint burned
off before the engine was warmed up, that was 10 years ago in the survival
days and it was cheap)

 Anyway the extractor bolt holes dont match up with the dualport intake
manifold at the heat riser tubes, so icant bolt it together, im wondering if
i could just use some formagasket to seal them temporarily until next month
when i can &quot;afford&quot;  the real deal muffler???????
any comments/warnings  would be appreciated, i really dont want to cause any
damage to my new engine
