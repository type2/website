&gt; When we Americans talk in general terms about a 1200 cc &quot;25 hp motor&quot;, what 
&gt; we
&gt; are really talking about is a 25 DIN bhp rated motor which is also a 30 SAE 
&gt; hp
&gt; rated motor (used up through March 1953).

Hi Bill,
Actually that engine using 75mm diameter P&amp;Cs is considered a 1100 cc engine 
though it is really a 1131cc displacement.

  When we mention a 1200 cc 30 DIN &gt; bhp motor, we're also talking about a 36 
&gt; SAE hp motor (like the earlier motor, this one has the built-in generator 
&gt; stand used up until May 1959 in the Bus).

On the other hand this engine using 77mm diameter P&amp;Cs has an actual 
displacement size of 1192cc which was rounded up to 1200cc for ease of 
speaking about probably!  Another interesting fact is the 36 SAE HP engine 
and the 40 SAE HP engines used from 1956 thru 1963 used the same size bore 
and stroke!
