Subject: battery explosion and clutch cable breaks

I had a battery explode today.  Here's how it
happened.  First, the clutch cable broke.  I check the
spares box and no spare cable.  I'm about 5 miles from
my house so I decide to try to get home by starting
the engine in first gear,  sync the shifting and nurse
it home.  When I tried to start the engine in first
gear the battery blew sky high.  The top and left side
came right off splatering everything with acid.  I
squirted off the engine and interior with window
washing liquid and pulled the battery, or what was
left of it.  A short ride with the tow truck driver
gave me a chance to think about what happened.  First,
I should have recognized the play in the cluth pedal
as a cable on it's way out.  I just adjusted it and
actuated it about ten times thinking if it was fraying
it would fail and I'd know.  I should have tried it 5
more times and it would have failed in the drive way. 
My questions:  How long do cluth cables usually last. 
This one lasted 39 months or 13,615 miles.  And what
the hell happened to the battery!  It sounded like a
grenade went off in there...
