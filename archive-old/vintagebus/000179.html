 I am in dire need of heat! &gt;&gt;
Hi Joshua,
What year bus do you have?  Do you have all the cooling tin on the engine in 
place?  Are you running the thermostatic bellows to properly get the engine 
to operating temperature?  Have you made sure all of the heater ducts are in 
place and securely hooked up?  
   We are driving our 1960 panel conversion with 1641cc single port out here 
near you in the Seattle area and are comfy in about five minutes have to have 
our coats off about ten minutes after starting to drive the bus from a cold 
start outside.  We also want to install gas heaters for when the weather gets 
down in the 20Fs and lower to help get the bus heated up sooner but have 
driven in temps down to 10F and have been warm enough on trips longer than 15 
minutes.
