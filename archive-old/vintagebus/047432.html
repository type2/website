I need some wiper blades for my bus. Can I get away with using bug

congrats on getting the flood and the wiring sorted out.

ya, you can use bug wiper blades, the only difference is they are slightly 
shorter, so you get less windsheild wiped.   well that and the price.

You can get repro wiper disconnects and a one eye duck.  That way you can 
leave the wipers attached, and lift them out and turn them to center, to be 
held in the bill of the one eyed duck when you have the safaris open.  When 
it rains closing the windows and lifting the wipers into place takes no time.
