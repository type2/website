Great post. I've had good results blowing primer and paint onto cars
with an el-cheapo $20 gun, and a small compressor. When my trusty $18
surplus compressor finally bit the dust, after blowing lots of paint ,
I bought a cheap compressor, including a small airbrush, and large
gun, for about $60-70. I forget the price, it lasted 12 years, and did
a good job. Painted a lot of daily driver &quot;bombs&quot; with it. It's cheap,
and does the job, as long as the wind ain't a blowin. The only extra I
suggest to this rig, is a water trap, and a pressure valve with gauge.
Got mine at an industrial shop for about $20, 18 years ago. If I've
actually won that $1500 Tru-Valu shopping spree, (the ticket is at my
Mom's house, and I won't believe it till I see it) I'ff finally get a
Real Compressor, and some air tools to go with it. 

Lisa
