Been there, done that. It's a vacuum problem with one or both 34 PICT-3
carbs.
Oh, and if you are running an electric fuel pump, check to see if the
pressure regulator is set right. Those cheapy regulators can go out of
adjustment and flood the carbs.

There is no balance tube between my Carbs, they just got short manifolds
that bolt right to the heads.
Second .............. it has an electric fuel pump but I haven't found a
regulator. If I find one what is the PSI that I should set it at?
