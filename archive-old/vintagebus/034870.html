&lt;&lt; I put them in (without glue) just to test the fit. When I shut the door it 
doens't seem to shut all the way, with the old seals the door shut flush on 
the outside, now it kind of sticks out a little.   Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Yes, readjust your door striker plates and make sure to put a dab of grease 
on them to allow less friction when closing.  Youy will just have to allow 
the seals to get used to your doors.  Eric&amp;Barb
