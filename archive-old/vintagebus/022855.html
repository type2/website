Subject: 60 panel update
Mime-Version: 1.0


Well, I re-painted the panel this weekend, and it looks like I have better
coverage this time.  Yellow is a major bear to paint!  As of this writing,
about 75% of the bus is color-sanded and had the first swipe at polishing.
Found a couple spots with orange peel, but nothing too major.  I found one
good blemish in the paint: on the lower passenger door, there were some
bubbles in the paint.  I pricked one, and guess what I found inside?!
Water!  Oye!  I musta splashed it on when I was doing the wet sanding, and
it ended up in the paint.  Or it got into the primer/filler in that area.
I'll end up stripping the area and re-painting it at a later date - that
can be done with everything else on the bus operational...
