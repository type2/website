It all depends on what year. All of the 59 and earlier repop ones are
marginal
whether you get WW or WCM. Now if you are looking for 60 and later, hands
down WW, there's have the waffling and are almost correct, where-as WCM are
just a flat piece of rubber.  We have been working on new floor mats for
almost a year now and from what I've been told they are almost ready (I've
heard that before) what we are having made are 55 to 59, 60 to 67 (hole not
cut for high beam switch) and 68 to 71 as if any of you care. All of the
molds were made off of either NOS or perfect originals (they used my mats). 
   The WW use a different rubber then WCM so they are not shinny as WCM are
and WW rubber seems to be a little firmer.

Can anyone give me some feedback on front floor mats from the repop house? 
Good or bad, I think I heard they weren't as thick?
