I used to have a old German mechanic that when ever I would bring him a new car to work on, it would always come back with the fuel line (metal) secured to the left side of the fan shroud.  He would always scold me when they weren’t there.

The line went through a small bracket that was attached via the screw that held the shroud to the #3/#4 top cylinder tin.  I think I've seen this in a factory book, but not sure.  Was this stock?

&gt;So, I'm confused about the path the fuel line should follow from where it
&gt;comes in through the body to the fuel pump.  It used to go under the paper
&gt;air hose, but it was touching the heat riser.

Under the air hose is right.  I have found that if you play with the 
rubber hose between the line and the pump, and the grommet in the front
engine tin, you can usually get the line to &quot;float&quot; so it doesn't touch
the fan shroud, heat riser, etc.  You may have to cut a slightly longer
or shorter piece of fuel line at the pump to get this right.

&gt;That seemed wrong, so I put it over the paper air hose, which also seems 
&gt;wrong.  Now it seems to have a gravity problem, so that I have to keep
&gt;the gas tank over 1/4 full or no gas comes through the line.

Yep.  The fuel pretty much flows by gravity from the gas tank to the pump.
Look at the level of the &quot;shelf&quot; that the gas tank sits on...notice how
it's just a bit higher than the pump.  The fuel line has to be routed
no higher than the bottom of the tank.
