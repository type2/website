Subject: The benefits of women dealing on vehicles.

Well, this is a note to let those of you on the list that have understanding 
significant others, to let them do your dealing on vehicles.  This weekend 
my wife bought me a 1966 split deluxe bus and a 1971 bay camper.   The most 
interesting thing is that I talked with the owner of the 1966 bus and was 
only able to get him down to about $1500.   Then my wife decided she wanted 
to get me these busses for my birthday (the end of July) and went to go talk 
to the owner (without my knowledge.)  She was able to talk the guy down to 
selling both busses, with delivery to our house, for SIGNIFICANTLY less then 
what I was able to get the owner down to on only the 66 bus!

Boy, it sure is nice having a wife that also enjoys the VW adiction as much 
as I do.   It sure makes a wonderful relationship.  Hopefully next year at 
the Auburn Hills show we will have a significant number of restored vehicles 
to show off.

I sure do love and admire and am very proud of my VW loving Wife!!!!

Enjoy,
Mike
