I am finally putting the finishing touches on my '67 deluxe.  I have gone 
all out on this restoration and have everything as stock as possible.  There 
are a few places where evidence of fixing is seen.  The driver's side floor 
has a sheet metal piece on it (about a half a square foot), and a few places 
at the front of the cargo floor have been patched as well.  Unfortunately, I 
need to sell this thing.  My question is, what is the price range for a bus 
like this?  Also, are there any commonly overlooked areas that can increase 
or decrease the final value?
Thanks,
-Wes Daniel
