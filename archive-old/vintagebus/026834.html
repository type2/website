Subject: 72 Westy Owners Manual

I wanted to start looking for a owners manual for our 72 Westy and was
going to call some folks from Hemmings motor news, but thought it might
be good to ask if anyone on the list had one.
Also is their &quot;JUST&quot; a Westy manual or did a westy come with the same
manual as all of the other busses.
If no one on the list has one any suggestions on whom to buy from,
what's the price range for a decent used manual.

A thought on the Spedo thread from the other day, I had my wife drive
beside me at 55 on a long flat stretch of double lane road, I was
running about 58 to her 55. I know it's not as exact but it gave me a
rough estimate of my speed.

Any one have thoughts on speaker wire. I want to run some to the rear
for some speakers but don't like the idea of having two separate lines
running under the bus. I thought about using a phone line wire, that way
I could splice the first speaker in and then run it on over to the
other, however I'm concerned if the smaller wire will cause any loss in
power. Any one know or have input.

Thanks
Meredith
