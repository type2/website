 I am now in the final stages (putting the boots on etc) of redoing my RGB's
 and putting the axles on a ronnie/rancho trans.
 
 My question is how much up and down movement is permissible on the stub
 axles.  If i take the pass side stub axle and gripit in my hand and apply
 downward force i can barely feel and see some movement probably (.3mm), but
 on driver side I can hear it and it moves probably .7-1mm.
 
 In other words i  moved them like how you do when you check to see if your
 bearings are bad in the first place,  but I have no where near the slop i
 had before i replaced the bearings.  The old bearings were totally shot.
  &gt;&gt;
hm, I don't know how much wiggle is acceptable. Ideal is  A Hair or so, I 
believe, guessing.  How much is a hair?   .005&quot;- how much endplay your motor 
should have. Good question.  Why don't you look it up in the Bentley and tell 
us the max wiggle allowed?

I have noticed, however, that some brand new RGBox bearings have more wiggle 
in the bearings new out of the package that the old ones I have taken off a 
car.
