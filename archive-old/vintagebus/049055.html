Yeah, it has bus content.  The May 2000 Playboy centerfold is butt naked in a Deluxe!  It even has safaris!  Now I don't normally read Playboy, and I have no idea how the damn thing wound up on my desk at work, but since I had never looked a Playboy I decided to open it up.  Low and behold there's a Bus in it.  Woo hoo, Playboy is cool!!!  Hard (oops) to tell what year, but appears to be a '64-'66.  The centerfold is an '80.  Geez I'm getting old.
