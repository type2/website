Subject: Re: [VB] Panel in Kombi clothing?

Let me guess - It is a walkthrough camper, right? Walk through panels 
had no venting at the top rear sides because the ventilation would come 
from the front cab area. It was not likely that the panel would have 
the front passenger area separated by a divider wall. But for the bench 
model it was.

&gt; Funny you should ask.  I have a friend with a 66 Sundial Camper, 
&gt; documented
&gt; and everything.  It has the camper windows cut through the sides, as 
&gt; Sundial
&gt; tended to do, with no window behind the cargo doors.  Thing is, it 
&gt; DOES NOT
&gt; have louvres in the rear and up top, as I thought all panels did.
&gt;
&gt; What a mystery! !
