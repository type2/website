Subject: RE: [VB] PROBLEM on the road!!!

Thom,

I've done the timing to 32 degrees, and the compressions look good. I'm
gonna have to just see what happens rest of today's activities, and I'll
be back on tomorrow, assuming it makes it thru tonight!

Tomorrow I'll be at my friends workshop/home, and have more time and
space.

Thanks so far for all the suggestions - tomorrow I'll have the options of
checking the lower head bolts torque.

&gt; Hrm.  Did you do the Ring/Valve check?  (rev to ~2800 rpm, hold there for
&gt; a minute or two, then let off and listen for the telltale rattlesnake
&gt; sound)?
&gt;
&gt; Are your rocker arms torque'd to spec and all the washers intact?
