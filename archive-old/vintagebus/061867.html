&gt; I'm about to reinstall the Westy interior in my 66 van but I'm wondering
&gt; about a few things.
&gt; #1) Is there a plywood floor in the dining area between the rear seat and
&gt; front seats. If so how thick was it?

Yes.  Check the archives or page Jim Ellis here on the list.  He just
did a good write up of installing the sub floor and the door edging trim
(it was buried in some acid tripping esoteric mumbo jumbo though ;-) ). 
This included the thickness and the procedure to get it to fit
correctly.  Originally there was sheet linoleum applied over it.  Don't
forget the threaded ring/collar that gets screwed to the floor for the
table leg to mount in.



&gt; #2) Interior lights. I've got two interior light fixtures that came with
&gt; the Westy.
&gt; These lights are about 6&quot; long and hold two tube type bulbs but have no
&gt; covers. Are they worth reinstalling or should I find alternate lights?
&gt; Guess the real question is; where do I get the covers &amp; how much?

The correct lights for the driver side (for and aft of the main table)
are over head interior bus lights mounted vertically to the wall(between
the windows really).  The cover for that year SO42 is a rectangle shaped
piece of Plexiglas (semi transparent).  Late 64's and possibly some very
early 65's had leftover clamshell covers...a much harder find BTW.   A
small rotary switch is mounted to the cover and the cover mounts to a
&quot;s&quot; shaped bent piece of SO-42/44 curtain rod stock which in turn is
mounted to the wall.
 
I bought a set from Todd (sorry Todd I forgot your last name) here on
the list.  Basically a perfect replica, not sure if he has any more. 
Expect to pay $10-$30 a pop for real used ones and they are almost
always cracked around the switch and mounting holes.

&gt; #3) The interior parts were just floating loose, stacked in the van when
&gt; I got it.
&gt; There was no sink (I can live with that).
&gt; There was no Ice Box or water tank. (I can live with that too).
&gt; There was no Stove (I don't like that).
&gt; What could I expect to see in a 66 Westy with walk through seats?
&gt; Need pics if you can send or direct me to decent interior shots.
&gt; Possibly this vehicle may been a Weekender or some thing else but still
&gt; carried the Westfalia placard.


You're in luck, as Everett has kindly kept up a great bunch of scans of
an original 66 owners manual...pictures and all.

To answer directly, 
1.  Never any sink.
2.  There was supposed to be an icebox/tank/pump
3.  Never any stove.  Bring a Coleman or propane unit and use it on the
door table.

Search the net for detailed pictures.  The SO42 is the most common of
all the real Westfalia conversion for the split.  All the above assumes
you actually have a SO-42/44 Westy.  There will be a brass tag attached
to the bottom of the fold down bed to confirm your busses identity.

Good luck.

Steve
