&lt;&lt;  I couldn't see placing a filter right next to the header,which is where 
the pump filter ends up.&gt;&gt;
Hi Woody,
We have done this and so far we have not noticed any increase of oil temp or 
loss of oil pressure due to this.

&lt;&lt;The mini sump seemed like the simpliest easiet solution.  I'm glad to hear 
you like it! It's funny but I never had heard anybody talk (good or bad) 
about these sumps/filters ,so I was a little unsure whether to buy 
one($59.95).It seems worth every penny. &gt;&gt;
The problem with the mini-sump filters is that they only work on the suction 
side of the pump.  This means at most they have to operate on only up to 
18Lbs per Sq inch of vaccume at sea level.  Which is very little to make a 
bypass filter valve to operate properly in conditions of cold oil or dirty 
filter.  This vaccume become much less while driving through high mountian 
passes!  Like ones we have traversed in Colorado of over 13,000 feet!  The 
oil pump/filter setup on the other hand operates the filter on the pressure 
side of the oil pump which reaches up to over 200 Lbs. per Sq. inch..
