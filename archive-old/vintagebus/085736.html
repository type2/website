Thanks everyone!

After installing new brushes, the red light went back to the way it's supposed to be -- off while engine running normal. The brushes (obviously) were really worn down (past the point of making any significant contact). Running electric RC cars since the late 70's really paid off -- I've installed brushes before, just on a smaller scale!

:-) 

Happy!

Off to install my new old ignition module...
