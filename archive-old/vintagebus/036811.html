I'm looking for front and rear bumpers, either early (50's) blades with the
pressed out center section or later Euro blades, also 2 pop out rear windows.

I have to trade several Westy jalousie windows, a brand new black perforated
vinyl headliner for a pop top '67 Westy, and maybe even my unused BN4 heater
out of my Thing(don't have much need here in Florida)

Jerry
