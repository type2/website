Let me mention this...
I think it is mainly the pressure sandblasters that can ruin body panels...
the siphon-style sandblasters use a lot more air per given amount of sand to
do the job... I think this cools the panel and helps prevent it from
warping. I haven't had any troubles with body panel distortion using a
siphon sandblaster _at_ 100 psi.

just my 2 cents on that... opinions are welcome

;)

&gt;First unless you know what you or who ever does the sandblasting is doing
you
&gt;could easily end up wrecking the VW.  Sandblasting at too high of pressure
&gt;will just ripple the panels of the body.
