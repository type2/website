 Hi Guys,
 
 My daily driver, '55 Single cab is not feeling so well.  The tranny has been
 popping out of second for the last year or so, and this weekend I think I
 finally broke her. I had gone surfing and had to pull into some soft sand to
 park, upon leaving in reverse I lost traction. A friend helped me by pushing
 on the front of the truck as I reversed. No probs getting out of the soft
 sand, but afterwards while sitting at idle in neutral the truck began to
 vibrate pretty badly around the engine. Hard to tell if the engine was
 vibrating or the tranny.  Driving her home I experienced the same vibration
 at stop lights, but not while driving.  Just before I pulled into the
 driveway, I could smell a something burning... A quick check revealed a
 smoking generator! Weird?  Could the generator have caused the vibrations
 around the engine?  The gen light has been coming on occasionally, but
 usually it goes off within a few minutes of driving.  Has anyone ever heard
 of a generator wearing out where it would get extremely hot and vibrate the
 engine?  In the past when gens have gone out on me, the light has just come
 on and stopped charging the battery...no smoke, grinding, or whirling sound
 as this one has.
 Thanks :-)

I have had smoking generators.  Think the regulator went bad.   The generator 
light went on and the gen was smokin, I found when I looked.   I changed the 
gen w/o changing the reg and friend the next gen also.  oops.  all works now 
though.  Toss your regulator.

if you watch the motor running does it look like the bearings are bad, ie 
does the nut holding the pulley on wiggle?   If you take the fan belt off 
does the shaking go away?  


then again, maybe you broke the tranny mounts- check them- and is your 
shifting gone a bit funky?
