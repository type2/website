Hey Diane, no hard feelings. You have to understand that there are a lot
of young people out there who have a short attention span. If the
subject doesn't change every couple of days it starts wearing on their
nerves. You would think that they have never been new to the VW thing
themselves and never had any questions at all, it's just in their jeans
(genes), where their brains are, heh heh. Sorry, oops, I'm in for a
wallopin !

No problem Woody, I won't bother you with my tiresome problems any more.
Excuse me for having so many problems...   but did it ever occur to you
that
maybe the majority of male mechanics are _at_$$#%\&quot;$ .. and have no
conscience
regarding ripping of the uneducated ..   I'll unsubscribe and go bother
the
NG for a while .. I mean, if that's ok with you ...
