&gt; I am getting ready to part out a couple of busses that are
&gt; past restoration.  How is a person to know what a fair market
&gt; price of an item  is, for either ebay or swap meet?  Is there
&gt; a guide out there that says a door handel for a 59 single cab
&gt; should be $50?
&gt;
&gt; thanks for you imput

Before you part them out, you may want to check with a compadre that is a
shop teacher in Kansas.  He'll probably want to try to keep the busses
together as much as possible, and I would think he's near you...
