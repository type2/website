Subject: 3 Splitties on a flatbed

I've been away for a couple of days and I'm wondering if I missed an
annoncement about someone having some busses shipped west. I was
traveling east on I-80 in Nebraska around North Platte and what to my
wondering eyes did appear but a flatbed  with 3 busses heading west.
Doing 80 at the time I was not able to get a lot of detail but I think
the one on the tail was kind of pink. Anybody know 'bout them. Also saw
a faded green bus in a rest stop further east but was past the entrance
before I saw it. Wow 4 busses in one trip. For a non-event journey that
is by far a personal best.
