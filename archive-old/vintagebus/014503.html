&lt;&lt; The overhead vent in my  63 does not really turn off. I took off the cover
 thinking that this would be a neat place to install gauges but decided
against
 it thinking that rev counters do not like the wet. &gt;&gt;
Hi Sam,
You really do not need to mount your tach.  Instead have a passenger hold the
tach and tell you when 1,500 and 3,000 RPM are achieved at what speed in each
of the forward gear and write these down.  After this 15 minute drive you do
not need the tach unless you change tire dia., go drag racing, or are deaf and
can not hear if the engine is running when at a stop light (Which several of
our friends are.).  Instead you should wire for oil pressure, temp and volts
or head temp gauges.  We have mounted our gauges under the package tray to the
right of the speedo so both drive and passenger can monitor them.  By using a
bracket sandwiched between under the speedo pod and the connecting steering
column bracket you do not need to drill or cut VW sheet metal to install your
gauge cluster.   Eric &amp; Barb
