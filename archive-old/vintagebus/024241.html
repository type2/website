Subject: 6 volt to 12 volt converters

Just a note, as it was discussed in great detail a short while back,
about getting a 6 volt to 12 volt step transformer for use with car
audio equipment. There had been much talk of Radio Shack still caring
them, as far as I can tell they don't, I have had to go there on other
business a few times in the last couple of weeks and checked just out of
general curiosity. However my SO informed me last night, over the 4 am
Denny's run, while discussing the pros and cons of getting a vintage VW
that would require some heavy work, that Best Buy carries the step up
transformers in there audio department next to the wiring kits, and that
the cost is about $30.

The sad news is that I will not be getting said vintage VW any time
soon, with the Honda going thru its first set of replacement parts in
172k miles, and the '76 needing a new engine and perhaps transmission,
which is brining talk of sending her up to the auction block being as
the body is in truly wonderful shape, and the interior is very clean and
remarkably intact, it is making talk of selling her off for what we have
in her and getting something else, not to worry it would be VW.. I
however am trying to convince her that we should get some thing else as
well as fix her up, and sell her later.. Very, very, very much later if
I have my way. however in the end this just means that the funds that
would be need to restore the said vintage VW, which is in hard shape
will not really be readily available at this time, painful as it is, it
is a sad reality. I shall once again have to put on hold my dreams of
having a splity... &lt;sniff&gt;&lt;wimper&gt;

As it is I am rambling on and wasting bandwidth.. just wanted to pass on
the information I had thrust upon me.
