Subject: Disc brakes on '67...help 
Date: Sun, 20 Sep 1998 19:48:29 PDT

 I'm seriously thinking about converting my '67 deluxe to front disc 
brakes. I use this bus alot and haul my family camping often and a 
little more brake up front would be alot safer. 

What is the best kit out there?

Any pro's or con's welcome....

Thanks
old bus guy
