Subject: new tires/spare fit behind wheel well

oh yeah forgot to mention, I'm planning on going with the Hankook 195/R14.
$70 from Bus Depot. I wasn't too happy with the Tire Rack options.

Anyone using this size-I asked bus depot about the tires potential hitting
the frame when turning-they said &quot;No.&quot;

I asked about this size tire fitting in the spare tire spot behind my bench
seat, they said they were not sure. I checked that miata tire sizing guide,
and it appears as though they should fit, but I've had problems with things
that were supposed to fit, but in real life they don't. so thought someone
out there might have experience they could share...

Thanks,
