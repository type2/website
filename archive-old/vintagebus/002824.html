Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Drive Away Tent OEM / NFS

The poles from my side tent are a light brown color and are from a 1972 tent
from a bus my father owned in germany when we lived there during the 70's.
Not sure when the exact change took place to the goldish color on another
tent that I also used to own.

&gt; &gt; My poles are a goldish color. The tent is date 1973. Poles appear to
&gt; &gt; be original correct poles. I beleive all the westy poles I have seen
&gt; &gt; are the same goldish color.
&gt;
&gt; My side tent's poles are still painted their original brown color.
&gt; Pretty close to the V'gon paint color 'aswan brown'.  The tent came
&gt; with my Westfalia Campmobile which was manufactured in May 1973.
&gt; Another data point.   :)
