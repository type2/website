Well, I guess a show report is not really necessary at this point but
I'm  going to anyway.
It was all the things Greg and Scott said but we still had a good time.
It's just fun too see people you know and check out their rigs and
talk VW. We got lucky
and got a space on the isle so we could put out the tent. Scored
an SO34 brochure from the guy parked right behind us.
What a coincidence, that was the only thing I was looking for
at the toy and lit show (weak) the night before. (thanks Dave!)
No awards for our 39k mile OG flip seat westy

There were a LOT of ovals there. couple of Pucks, a splitty ambulance,
a BUNCH of high roofs. A lot of them had roof racks. How they get stuff
on the racks is something I'd like to see. Camp out with the Split Bus Club
folks that night was fun. Hauled back a middle seat for another listee.
One thing that did suck was buying a drivers side door handle
from Gabriel that wasn't the right part. Aren't 62 and 63 doors the same??
I had him re-key it and everything but the lever inside is longer than the
original. If anyone has a contact # for him, please pmail me.
I didn't take a lot of pictures but if you want to see what it was
like, check out the link below. Overall we thought it was better than Kelly
Park
and will probably go in 2002 but next time I'll have the oval window
disguise
ready so we get a spot on the grass ;)
