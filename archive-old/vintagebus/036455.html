&lt;&lt; The green ones ( pt # 113 198 029 ) are for early blocks to late coolers, 
if you look at them they will have a different size on each side, the smaller 
side is the block side (say on a 40 hp or early 1500 block) and the large 
side is for the offset oil cooler adapter. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
The tapered type cooler seals should also come with three copper clad 
washers/shims to go between a SR engine case and later DR non-dog house 
cooler with the much larger diameter openings in the bottom of the cooler.  
Using these washers/shims in any other configuration is a leaky disastor.
