Subject: Ice Box Bounty!

Well, 

Unfortunately, I won't make it to Jerome :-( (have to work the stinking
Emmy Awards.  The entertainment industry sucks).  

Heres the deal:

WANTED: 64-67 Westfalia ice box

Discription:  3'X2'X2', single utinsel drawer, small plastic lined
icebox w/door, water pump(on top) and tank (inside behind icebox), if
complete will have small folding table mounted to side.

If you see this box or for that matter the small door tables please pick
them up and make some money off of me.  I want to make YOU some cash! 
FYI the boxes usually go for $80-$100.  I'll go higher just for you ;-)!
Dont worry about the exterior venieer, just make sure the inside box is
not cracked and that the pump and tank are there.

Warning:  The correct box will NOT have a small metal &quot;sink&quot; OR a &quot;vent
tube&quot; exiting the top of the box.  Bubble window boxes are a dime a
dozen!

Please p-mail me if you have one even if you're not going to the show! 
I'm in Southern Cal, but will drive all over the West to pick one of
these F'ing things up.  

PS: I also need some interior Westy lights too....missed out on the last
ones that Todd had posted.

Thank you, thank you, thank you in advance.

Have fun everyone!!


Steve Harris
