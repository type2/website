Subject: RE: [VB] Thank you!

  In AZ they have a book (MVD) that tells you where all the VIN numbers
(primary and secondary) are on cars goinf back to at least 1960. They (AZ
MVD) will not accept the plate in tha cab only, they use that as the
secondary and use the stamped numbers in the engine compartment for the
primary.
  What really screws them up is if you show them the engine compartment
numbers on a real early bus and then they want a secondary and there aren't
any. Then they see the chassis number on the bulkhead,then the shit starts,
into secondary to prove that one number is a vin and the other a chassis.

&gt;When I showed them the plate on the overhead vent, they sent me to a
&gt;special office to have it verified, because the vin number wasn't
&gt;on the dash where they thought it was supposed to be.

The plate on the dash wasn't mandated in the US until about 1969.  I
think some makes had it before then but I don't think any VWs did.

There is a pretty good write up on VINs here:
http://www.nsxprime_dot_com/FAQ/General/vin.htm  It's geared towards H*nda
vehicles but the format of the VIN is the same for any car sold in the
USA since 1981.  I used to think that there was no standard before
1981 but according to that site there was; it explains why Buses got
VINs like 215 xxx xxx starting in 1965.
