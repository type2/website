Subject: Re: [VB] Tank size - 10 Gallon?

My early bay tank holds just a skosh over 15 gallons.

&gt; Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment in a '58 single cab? The PO of mine said he put in a larger tank and I was thinking Bay tanks were 15 gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day and when I filled up I only could put in 15.  Didn't put in that much from the gas can.  Anyone know?
