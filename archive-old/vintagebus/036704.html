Yes. The rivets on the lower hinge are completely unsupported.

Due to time constraints I've decided to get it done by a local body guy. He
showed me a Humber Super Snipe(fat Brit car from the sixties) that he had
just done a similar job on. He went big and I like big! He says he will
drill out the rivets from the door and the hinge, then knock the door skin
back to shape and weld in a thick plate from the inside. He will then
redrill the holes and use flat head bolts to replace the rivets. These can
then be tightened from the inside of the door. He reckons that by making the
holes slightly oversize horizontal adjustment is possible and through the
use of shims between the door skin and the hinges vertical adjustment can be
achieved. I like this idea cos it means that future adjustments will not
require the use of a grinder and it will be invisible from outside!

Thanks for the ideas.

Later 

Michael
