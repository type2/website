Vnitagebuslistpostderigeurabouttohappen:

Hi.
Has this ever happened to you?
Today was Saturday. Meant an entire day to get caught
up on the stuff I have to do around the house.
So I go out to the garage to build the book shelves
for the nursery (6 week old daughter. Gonna have to
read some stories some time).
Necessarily, I rolled ol' DATHVW out of the garage to
give myself some room to work.

And, just as I'm reaching for the Makita(tm) power
miter saw, out of the corner of my eye, there it is:

The piece of rear hatch deluxe trim I bought at
Solvang.

The only piece of deluxe trim missing from DARTH when
I bought him. Sure, his trim was painted black, but
that was workable. Missing trim, however, was not
acceptable.

So there it sat. Beckoning from underneath the Evel
Knievel pinball machine.

I had to install it.

NO rhyme. No reason. Had to be done. And now.

But first, I had to strip it of the powder blue
(yuck!) paint still tarnishing it.

I grabbed the razor blade and the stripper and
diligently went to work.

Twenty minutes later:

WIFE: &quot;Jason?'

ME: &quot;Yeah, just looking for the extension cord!&quot;

WIFE: &quot;You're working on that bus!&quot;

ME: &quot;No, I just have to move some stuff out of the
way, and...&quot;


She was on to me. Crap. And just baout five more
minutes I would have had it.

Back into the corner goes the trim piece.
Out comes the pine 1x4 and the saw.

Soon, my friend. Soon.

She's got to sleep some time......
