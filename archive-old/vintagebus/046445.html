&lt;&lt; i got a new 67' tranny but i dont know how much gear oil to drop in the 
redux

sound like much. &gt;&gt;

Hi Nick,
Take one gallon of tranny oil of GL-4 rating.  Fill the RGBs and then fill 
the tranny center section.  If you do work on only the RGBs and so only drain 
them, make certain to refill the center section after filling the RGBs.  VW 
designed the tranny center section to allow about 1/3 of the oil in there to 
travel downhill through the axle tube to the leaky RGB.  So that if one of 
the RGBs has a leak you have a longer period of time to discover your problem 
before destroying completely that RGB due to lack of oil.
