 &lt;&lt;The path of least resistance would be to get a set of the brazilian ones,
 and a set of the make-up pieces that kelly sells, and have your body guy
 fix 'em up.  Your chances of finding really nice 3-piece doglegs are
 slender.  Isn't you bus 10/56 or so?  Does it have 3-piece doglegs now?
 &gt;&gt;
 
 I rather find original ones, then section in the seam.
 Not expecting to find original barndoor ones, just need some clean 56-62 
ones.
 Yes, its 10-55 and needs barndoor ones.

wolfsberg doglegs, or 3 piece doglegs please, 

or call my lug nuts barndoor lugnuts.
and the decklid brake lights &quot;barndoor brake lights&quot;

those doglegs did come on about 60,000 post barndoor buses.
