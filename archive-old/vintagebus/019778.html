Subject: re-torquing heads?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id OAA83062

when i bought my bus the PO told me the rebuilt engine had about 10,000 miles
on it, I have since put on about 24,000. 

I am now remembering having read something about re-tourquing the heads on the
bus, I have no idea if the PO did this, I assume you need to pull the engine
to do this? 

I haven't checke the idiot guidt or bentley on this yet...I know I should
check there but it is so much easier to ask y'all.(damm I have been in the
south too long if I am saying y'all)
I have a 1600 single port if that is relevant.

anyway, any info on this is appreciated...

ps I should be putting together some of the ez camper stuff this weekend. most
pieces are cut, and have two coats of sealer. I after screwing them together,
I will put another coat on, and try to install.
