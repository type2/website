You are such schemers.  Got the whole image and presentation thought out 
ahead of time.  tactics and map all planned.   And Ronnie the parts dealer 
and swap meet shmoozer says I 'use my womanly wiles' to get good deals on

 Yeh, I don't think it really works AS GOOD at swaps. I do like to pull this
 &quot;cheap shot&quot; on individuals out in public though. Like I said before, it
 works to my benefit about 90% of the time.
 
 &gt;If you're going to &quot;use&quot; a woman for something like this, at least
 &gt;*educate* her first so you don't both look like idiots.
 
 It is true that both of you should know your stuff. BUT...as you bus

 fir &gt;&gt;
