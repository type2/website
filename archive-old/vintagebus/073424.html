&gt; Am looking for some splittie front doors for my 61 Deluxe and was wondering 
&gt; if there is a difference between early doors (earlier than 62) and the late 
&gt; splittie doors (after 63)?

Hi Rob,
Well the mid 1964 chassi # 1 222 026 and later doors could be installed, but 
you would have to either cut and weld the earlier latch and exterior door 
handle areas out and weld in your earlier stuff or cut and weld in the later 
door striker areas!

  Really what you need to do is to study the area that the exterior flipper 
handles on your doors have a indent around the base of the handles or not, 
because on 29 DEC 60 chassi # 705 620 this area changed from a flat to a 
indented area around the handle bases.  

&gt; Let me know what you know!  Also looking for a 61 deck lid (what years work
&gt; here) 

1959-very early 1964.
