Just drill two new holes through the trim piece 30 mm
in from each edge.

Or, first get a pair of the endcaps for the trim piece
and use them as a guide. There is a hole in each one
of those which lines up wiht the last hole in the
trim. The rubber strip insert will cover the old
holes.

Make sure you bevel the holes like the rest of them.
You can do this by drilling a small hole just large
enough for the screw threads to pass through, then
CAREFULLY use a much larger drill bit and just kiss
the hole with the tip of the bit, making a bevel. It
works best with a drill press.

Good Luck
Jason

&gt; I'm fixing to install a piece of aluminum deluxe
&gt; trim on the rear hatch.  
&gt; I'm having a problem with it, because I need to
&gt; drill each hole out for it 
&gt; (the gate is not stock deluxe).
&gt; Now for my question.  The holes on the either end of
&gt; the trim are right on 
&gt; the edge...this means that when I drill the holes in
&gt; the gate for them, the 
&gt; will stick out and hit the seal when the door
&gt; closes.  I hope that makes 
&gt; sense?
&gt; Anyway, if I could get an answer more clear than my
&gt; question, I would be 
&gt; appreciative.
&gt; Thanks,
