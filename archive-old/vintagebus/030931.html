&gt;It would be kinda cool to try and pull some stats from the data on your
site, but within the context of the items being sold, data normalization
would be nigh impossible.
&gt;
It would be good to know the actual sale prices but that almost always remains
private.  I can only assume that vehicles that sell in an extreme short
period sell close to, or at, their asking price.

I do have every classifieds ad every placed on my site archived off.  A
search of historical data would be useful for price comparison and historical
purposes but I have been lax on providing such a feature.

I am aware of VWs that sell quickly and are placed on my site a week or
2 later for higher prices.
