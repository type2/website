Hi Jon,
First make sure you have all the cooling tin and engine seals to keep the 
cool air coming in and the hot exhaust air of the cooling system out from the 
engine compartment.  Then check to see if you have a 2:1 lower stock pulley, 
a 33, 34, or better yet 35mm wide fan, a dog house cooler or better a type 4 
cooler in a dog house.  40 Wt will probably be just fine as long as you can 
keep the oil pressure from idle on up between 10 - 80 lbs. sq. inch.  
Hopefully between 20-40 lbs. sq. inch at higher speeds/RPMs.  You need to 
have a temp and pressure gauge to keep an eye on things and adjust your RPMs 
to get the best cooling and oil pressure.  Any oil temp over 230 F is not 
good and over 250 F is a no, no due to break down of the compounds of 
petrolem made oils easily halving or more the oil lifespan.  Synthetic oils 
hold up better to high temps (but not immune) you might want to change to one 
of them since you live in such hot weather during the summer.  Barb had a 
late 1980s Pontiac Oldsmobile Firenza (AKA The Frenzied Toad) blew a head 
gasket due too high of oil temp after 60,000 original miles which caused the 
oil to break down during each of the factory reccomended every oil change of 
2,500 miles.  This caused the cam lobes to wear out to the point the valves 
did not open properly and damage the head gasket making the car blow white 
smoke out of both ends!  The repair shop that did the repairs said to change 
the oil every 1,500 miles to prevent this kind of oil related failure.  This 
in the Seattle area where it rarely gets over the 100 F mark.  Eric&amp;Barb
