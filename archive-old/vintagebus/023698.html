Subject: Yippie!!! I got it running after 17+ years

Ok, Ok, its not a bus but it is:
  1. One of the reasons I bought my double cab
  2. One of the reasons that I truly appreciate these aircooled motors.

It's my 1973 Bultaco 350cc Sherpa T.  It has been sitting in numerous
boxes since my oldest daughter was born in Jan. 81.  I had previously
purchased all the replacement parts and Friday my dad dropped by  with
the boxes of motorcycle parts.  I started in at 2pm today and by 8pm it
was together and RUNNING!  It was too late after dinner to go out and
terrorize the neighborhood, but I'll save that for tommorow.

I started riding dirt bikes when I was in 3rd grade and my dad was a
firm believer in if I was going to ride it, I had better know how to
work on it and fix it.  What a great lesson.

Now the bus content.  Due to the height of the bed and its shortness, it
makes it a bit difficult to get the bike up there (it can be done and
has been done by others).  My plan is to fabricate two receivers off of
the frame and have the receiver openings stop just under the bumper. 
The motor cycle ramp (4&quot; wide aluminum C channel would be bolted to two
mating pieces that would slide into the receivers.  Additional
brake/blinkers would be mounted on the ramp as the bike would hide those
tiny '60 lamps.  

Does anybody have any other ideas/suggestions??

Looks like dad &amp; I will be tearing up the hills this summer.
