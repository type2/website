Subject: Re: [VB] New Seat Covers

Kevin,

Who did you order them from? I need new upholstery for my bug and I'm not having much luck finding a
reliable supplier.

Well I have finally gotten around to ordering new seat covers....and now i
am trying to install them. I got some pointers from Ronnie _at_ oldvolks. but
one quick question to the list-how do you guys clean the frames? I was
thinking of taking them down to the self car wash, so I could basically
pressure wash them. Would this cause some premature rusting-right now there
is basically no rust on these(a little bit where the metal spikes that grab
the covers)
