Subject: Last Call for John Brown's Buses!

Well folks,
John Brown's Buses is right around the corner!  Make your plans to come to 
historic Harpers Ferry (only 60 miles west of Washington D.C. and 
Baltimore) and hang out with some good bus people. It should be a wonderful 
turnout with the replies that I have received.  There will be buses coming 
from as far North as Canada, and as south as Emerald Island, NC.  I will be 
at the KOA noonish Friday to welcome any early arrivals.  Greg Potts has 
graciously volunteered to serve up a Canadian pancake breakfast on Saturday 
morning. Plans for the afternoon are a possible carabus to a local farm for 
pumpkins, a round in the corn maze, and hay rides. Hopefully, there will 
be  pumpkin painting afterwards. Local attractions that may tempt some 
folks are Harpers Ferry, The Appalachian Trail, The C&amp;O Canal, Charlestown 
Race Track, and a Balloonfest in Millwood, VA (20 mile south).  Saturday 
evening with be a bon fire and awarding of door prizes.  And to top the 
weekend off, Sunday morning will be the famous Fullmoon Bus Club's Burrito 
breakfast.  Come one , come all, and join in the fun!

Joy Thru Air,
