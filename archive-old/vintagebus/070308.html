Subject: RE: [VB] Re [VB] vintage antenna toppers

My quest for a correct red tip for my og hirschmann safari antenna
continues.  I found a red tip antenna on epuke one day and bought it
just to find out it's one of those *newer* antennas.  Damn I said when
it finally arrived.  All wasn't wasted as I'll use it on another car....
but the dc antenna is still bare. :-(

Ted questioned my thought process:


David,

you spent a long time looking for a red tip antenna and now your going
to cover it up?
