Subject: RE: [VB] BBB V and VI

  I bought a digital so I can post and send pictures as soon as taken. I do
have film cameras, but I always forget to develope the film.

Why do people buy digital cameras???? If you bought a
real camera you would have photos of the event around

what you gonna do, store it on a disc?
