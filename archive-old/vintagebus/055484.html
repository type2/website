Subject: Re: [VB] two weld q's, one spec to DC


Stevo writ:



&gt; unsure that might be too hot.  meantime, the bed of my DC has a
&gt; side-to-side seam never apparently welded, but leaks and allows a lake in
&gt; the cargo/rear cab. would i be wrong in having this seam welded, or use a
&gt; more flexible filler since it wasn't welded at the factory?

They're all like that. I used a flowable silicone windshield sealant to fill
it, stopped the leakage and it flows into the crack so it can't be seen. Be
sure to do it AFTER you have painted.
