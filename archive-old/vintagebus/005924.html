Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Question/ a recent first

Probably because it was a commercial. My '63 DC had one cardboard visor.

&gt;   The closest response yet, But who knows for a fact?

&gt; The OE Parts Book shows the padded visor being introduced at VIN 374 811
&gt; Aug.
&gt; 58 (1959 model year) in Ice Blue, Silver Beige (Grey to regular folks) or
&gt; Cloud
&gt; White.  It's interesting to note that my ex-59 Euro Single Cab (back in
the
&gt; late 80's) had the cardboard visor however.  Could have depended on what
&gt; market
&gt; the Bus/Pickup was sold.
