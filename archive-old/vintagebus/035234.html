&lt;&lt; Anyway, on the rearview mirror there is a flip down smoked plastic cover 
for
 those nasty highbeams in the mirror.  Ive never seen this before and this
 thing is in excellent shape.  Is this a rare accesory, and whats its value
 you think? the mirror and shade are in great shape.   &gt;&gt;

If it an original period piece it may be valuable to someone.  They are being 
reproduced and available through Koch, Vintage Parts and the like. I have a 
repo in my Single Cab and works great when you get a jacked up 4x4 behind you.
