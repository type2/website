Subject: New source for Ribbed bumper splash pan seals!....?

Was looking at the swaps at BBB and i see this seal that my friend had. I
asked him what it was for, looked familiar. He says its bug, decklid seal. I
took it over and compared it to a ribbed bumper splash pan with og seal that i
had laying there, its exactly the same, *identical*.  So i say ok ill take it.
He saw all this happen then all the sudden he doesnt want to sell it to me?
wtf, bastard! (name withheld to protect the guilty) ah well i can get my own.

So anyway heres the seal
http://wolfsburgwest_dot_com/_securefolder/wwshowpn.asp?PN=111827705

Anyone with a ribbed splash pan with og seal, want to compare that cross
section to validate this? Just want to make sure for some freak reason my
seals didnt get changed out 20 years ago. I have 2 sets off 2 diff bumpers,
both have these.  Ill have to pull the seals off the binz and check those too,
they look the same tho from the underside tho.

Far as I know, there still isnt anyone reproducing the ribbed splash pan
seal.
