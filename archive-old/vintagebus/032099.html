Hello all,
Wish I'd found this list a long time ago.  I'm looking for some parts, and 
was hoping someone out there in busland could help:
1)I don't need the washer bottle for my ' 65 bus, just the cap, anyone know 
where I can find one?
2)Interior pictures of an early sundial (restoring and I want to be kinda 
accurate)
3)Is anyone on this list in Ohio?
Hmmmm, can't think of anymore right now, thanks in advance.

Matt
