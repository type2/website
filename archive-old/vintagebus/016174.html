Fellow Type2 owners,
I'm a bay window owner who acquired a NOS VW part for a vintage bus quite by 
error. I'd like to see it put to use by anyone who needs it. Basically it is 
a distributor breaker point plate (including points) for a pre-1959 bus. The 
VW part no. is 211 905 227 A and Karl (of the Bay list) tells me it fits the 
113 ...B/J distributor, while a vw mechanic says it fits the 019 distributor 
(which may be the same?). In any case its for a 36 hp engine pre-1959, is 
cadmium plated, with the original VW box in german calling it a 
Unterbrecherplatte. The plate is the diameter of a distributor, and has an 
electrically insulated flange on one side that appears to hold it in place. 
I bought it from a VW parts shop via eBay auction which described it as 
being for a late fuel injected van, an obvious error. I've got $2.50 
invested so far, and would be pleased to pass it along for that plus about 
$1.50 to mail it in the U.S. The points alone are probably worth that much. 
So if anyone wants it, please email me at rfinston_at_hotmail_dot_com.
Roland Finston - '75 Westy
