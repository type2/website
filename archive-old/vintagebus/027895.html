Enough already!!  Take it to private emails!  PLEASE!
Keep in mind you're flooding people's mail boxes with stuff they probably don't want
to hear.  Some people pay by the minute for internet access, so spare them if you
will.  Some people, such as myself, don't want to hear it!  I admit, I've done it
before, but I knew when to stop, and I learned after that time and it never happened
again.  So enough is enough.
