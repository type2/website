&gt;I'm a stickler for engine vibration. If you had it balanced and it vibrates
&gt;more than a stock I'd be popping that puppy out and tearing it down. It
&gt;could be as simple as one cylender not having the same compression ratio as
&gt;the rest, but if it was &quot;professionally&quot; assembled, you'd think deck height
&gt;and head cc'ing would be part of the job. I have also seen a rod in upside
&gt;down or a piston upside down causing vibration, but not really noticable. I
&gt;don't know, but if you don't want a box of extra parts, I wouldn't leave it
&gt;in that condition. IMHO

&gt;My 300 mile engine is running too hot I fear. On the hills 240+ (I stop and
&gt;cool down at 240). I received an e-mail last night that recommended I retard
&gt;the timing a bit to run cooler. I time it at 28 degrees max advance. Vac
&gt;advance distributor.
&gt;
&gt;Then today I found this in the archives:
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to set
&gt;the timing of a non-stock engine. On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in
&gt;the shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at it
&gt;the first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees and that usually
&gt;solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
&gt;retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a timing
&gt;light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where to
&gt;set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
&gt;the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine is a
&gt;NO NO, but to each there own. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What is the answer?
&gt;
&gt;Another subject: There definitely is a rpm dependant vibration in the beast.
&gt;Pisses me off as I spent a lot of money having the whole thing balanced
&gt;before I assembled it. How long till this engine flies apart?
