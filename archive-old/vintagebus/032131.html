I didn't realise people were talking about RGboxes going bad from too many 
rpms.   I have seen a  violently self destructed one, but that was because of 
bad bearings- so bad that the gear teeth ate through the RGBox housing and 
the oil was gone, many shavings in the transaxle, actually one axle shaft 
snapped, I have the outer end of the axle shaft with the slip on gear still 
stuck to it as a memento, some people should not drive VWs.  &quot; It made this 
noise for a few weeks but I kept driving it, and then it just stopped going.&quot; 
  duh. Anyway, I believe people were talking about accellerated engine wear  
and higher heat   (not RGbox wear) from too many rpms.

4500rpms going into the RGB- divide by 1.26 , okay what tire size do these 
airplanes use when they fly?  
  Now you can use the formula (Dave E has it?) to go back wards from the 4500 
to figure what the main shaft rpms would be.    choose dif   r&amp;ps and 4th 
gears

I just got an interesting phone call from a company that builds airplanes

looking for RGB (big nut). It seems that for the last 30 plus years they

have been useing VW Big Nut RGB's in airplanes powered by Corvair engines.

The interesting part of this is that they turn these at 4500 RPM's at the

axle shaft, I'd like to figuare out what MPH that would work out to be. All

this talk of handgernading RGB's by turning to many rpm just went out the

window. 


If anybody feels like seeing corvair powered airplanes and a few VW powered

airplanes there is a fly-in at Laughlin airport in Febuary, 2001
