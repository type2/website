Aaargh!
Every time I try to do a p-mail I seem to send to the whole list. Every
time I try to send to the list I get it back from the mail filter! 

Sorry for the multiple posts and public posts that should be p-mail...

As for the oil light business,

&gt;(Oil Light comes on) No the light comes on usually after I have driven

The green light is the oil pressure because at night &gt;sometimes my red light glows very lightly when all the lights are on. I &gt;think I will change the oil sensor the engine only has 9000 miles on &gt;it. Thanks for all your help I will buy a sensor today and see if the &gt;fixes it.

What kind of highway flyer you running? I just noticed the .sig...

When your oil is cold, it is more viscous, and your oil pressure will be
higher. The stock oil pressure sender grounds against the case where it
screws in at 7psi and below. 7psi is not enough. I hope that your oil
sender switch will help, but I doubt it. Has it been 9000 hard miles? Is
it a large-bore or stroked engine? 

The glowing red light means different things on different buses. Most 6v
buses have a glowing/flickering charge light. on 12 buses with
generators, it usually means that you need brushes, or may soon need a
generator. If you run a 12v alt, I would check the connection at the top
of the alt for the idiot light, and the main connection....

Good luck.
