They stamped the date of manufacture in the front doors in the area
around the top hinge with the same kind of stamp used on the wheels.
It's a circle with the month in the top and year in the bottom. I don't
know for sure about the other doors, but I bet that date circle is there
somewhere.

&gt; Good evening all. I just got back from rummaging through a friend of mines
&gt; back yard and happened upon a complete set of doors for an early bus in like
&gt; mint condition. Both front doors, cargo doors, rear hatch and deck lid. Is
&gt; there any way to determine the year of these?
