Subject: PU Tilt

The single cab set ups must be less than for the crew cabs. It seems to me
that I have seen anywhere from $600 to $1200 for these crew cab tilts. I
almost bought a complete setup that had been on a Double Cab for about 2
months when new. It was beautiful. The whole deal was $800 and I thought
that was a good deal. After much deliberation with the significant other we
decided there just wasn't the funding at the time. I let it go. I don't see
$750 as out of line, especially since that is the starting price.
