There is a very large industrial salvage yard here in Seattle on 4th
avenue S.  Great place to scrounge around in.  Excellent place for metal
stock, and I have seen thoses wheels in bins there too.  don't remember
the costs, but I have to assume they are cheap just like everything else
they sell.
later
