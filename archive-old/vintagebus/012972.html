Aussie busses have the vents on top because, in essence, they drive
upside-down.  Computer monitors for the southern hemisphere are also
different I found out, something to do with the magnetic alignment.

If it was an Aussie bus, the upper vents would be the same size as the lower
vents, with two &quot;columns&quot; of them, or one extra-wide column..

Bench panels simply had 3 or 4 small vents - less than half the size
of the standard, below-the-belt vents.

Actually the Aussie vent arrangement is so they could pull in air that was
less  dusty.

&gt; Woody's observation would indicate it's related to the seating arrangement in
&gt; the cab and the likelyhood of Australians on board.  Hmm...
