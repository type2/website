 Didn't know that (I tend to take my buses as they are, rather than
 worry about being an authenticity freak; there're other parts of my
 life that use up any such ambitions).  It's either a Kombi or a
 Standard, going by the fact that it doesn't have chrome trim at the
 paint line (nor holes for mounting the trim, of course).  The title
 says it's a Kombi, but as far as I've seen, *all* microbus titles say
 they're Kombis, including some from the mid-70s....

the state of Wa calls them &quot;Trasw&quot;  (transporter/station wagon?), &quot;Van&quot;,  or 
&quot;SW&quot;,  but my insurance company calls them Vanagons.   my 61 vanagon.  ?

 Looking at the definitions in Thom's bus FAQ, I'm pretty sure it's a
 Standard.  Has a cloth headliner and two-tone paint (white on green).
 The front door panels have brown vinyl on the upper 2/3rds or so, with
 white below.  It doesn't have carpet anywhere, though (rubber mats
 front and back).

yup sounds like a standard micro- seagull grey/mango green w/white&amp; brown 
interior.  The deluxes came with carpet on the shelf above the engine, but 
the standards came with a piece of painted hardboard there, no carpet.
