Just the conversation that Clara and I were having yesterday 
after I dropped off a gearbox with her.  I'll have way more than
$195.95 into new parts cost alone in my rebuilds.  But then 
I try to build these as close to 'new' as realistic.  You could 
use more used parts in a rebuild and might be OK for a while 
but if the original could have lasted 20 years then why not this 
one?  Someone said on one of the VW lists recently that if
a part was 95% worn out -still within spec by 5%- would you 
want that part in your vehicle? I think that pretty well sums up
my viewpoint on some rebuilds.

&quot;Got a $10 head?  Then buy a $10 helmut&quot;
