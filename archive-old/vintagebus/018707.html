I feel that I am the person to comment on this one because I did just that!  I
came across an NOS muffler that was too narrow and needed to be &quot;stretched&quot;. 
Why it was this way is a total mystery to me.  The engine was stock, the heat
riser was the proper dimension from inlet to outlet, but the muffler did not
fit.  Must have been welded together incorrectly - mal-adjusted jig or some
damn thing.  What I did was use a hacksaw to cut about 7/8 of the way through
the large pipes (put the cuts on the correct side!!) and then bend what is
left of the pipe to make it fit the engine.  Then I cut out a
watermelon-shaped piece of thick sheetmetal (the same thickness as the pipe)
and weld this piece in.  Now, you probably notice that after doing this the
flanges are not facing the right direction in relation to the cylinder heads. 
Start the nuts in, and heat the pipe cherry red hot (don't worry, the head
won't be damaged - you'll be heating at the curve of the pipe of the muffler
which is far enough away from the aluminum..) and tighten the nuts a little at
a time as you have your friend keep it cherry red.  It will bend into the
right plane majically.  Incidentally, I did this by myself and it was a bit
difficult doing two jobs at the same time (heating and tightening) so a buspal
will be very helpful.

The muffler fits just fine.

It appears that the previous owner installed some spacers between the
case and cylinders. This is complicating my plans to use a stock
muffler and stock 34 pict carb on 1600 dual port. It appears that
the spacing between the #2 and #4 exhaust ports is 3/16&quot; too wide.

I'd appreciate any suggestions as to how to stretch the muffler and
heat riser tube to fit. I'd rather not go dual carbs and extractor
exhaust.
