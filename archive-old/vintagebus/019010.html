FWIW, if you *do* adjust the clutch with the engine out, make sure you
exactly follow the procedure and measurements given in the Bentley
manual.  Otherwise, you'll adjust it until it seems right, and then
you either won't be able to get the engine in all the way, or the
clutch'll slip once you because you got it too tight.

:  nut to turn by hand and I can hardly fit any tools up in that area. 

A good pair of vice grips, a long screw driver or other lever arm, a
helper, and one of those hand isometrics thingies (big spring with
plastic handles so you can squeeze the spring).  Exercise with the
latter until it doesn't feel like work any more (this step is
optional, depending upon the individual).  Now apply the vice grips to
the end of the threaded bit that the wing nut doesn't screw onto.
Have the helper hold onto one end of the lever, and guide the other
end so that pushing the lever towards the front causes the clutch arm
to move to the front.  Have the helper push until there's some slack
in the cable, and then hold it.  Reach up with your built-up hand, and
turn the wingnut.  Get your hands out of the way, and have the helper
slowly ease off on and remove the lever.  Don't forget to take out the
vice grips.

The forces involved in turning the wingnut will probably do some minor
internal damage to your knuckles; don't plan on doing any fine-control
exercises for a few hours afterwards and you should be ok.

Note that, if the wingnut really is semi-frozen into position (happens
relatively frequently), the &quot;right&quot; thing to do would be to remove the
wingnut and chase the threads on it and the clutch cable with a tap
and die.  Things'll go much more easily next time (like, maybe not
needing a helper).
