&gt; Regretfully I must agree with Jim Ellis. You got about a 71 there.
&gt; If you can come up with an engine code or VIN Number you'll know.
&gt; Almost anything you may need to restore it is available at almost any
&gt; price .......... Used, New, AfterMarket.


You vintage geeks are so silly..
You can tell a BD from a Non.
You know youre innies from your outies.
Small or Large nuts, 63-64 oh you got it all down.

But a bay window....
Its all so confusing.
