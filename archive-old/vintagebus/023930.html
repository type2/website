do not know when Westys had front curtains installed with the little
&gt; clips, probably nylon, to hold their curtains up. They had stops at each
&gt; end with screws. What is the replacement? I have a 63 with front
&gt; windshield curtain &quot;slides&quot; for lack of a better word. What do I use to
&gt; replace these with? What have you used?

I went down to tthe local RV supply store recently and found that you
can order aluminum curtain hanging stuff with the grooves for the little
plastic whatsits in 8' lengths for about 12 bucks. The plastic thingies
were another 2 or 3 dollars. The stuff looks right, and seems to be
malleable enough to work, but i have not yet installed it.  I got it for
my 65 kombi, and have used my 67 westy as a guide. The westy's seems to
be pop-riveted in place, so that is how I plan to go with the new stuff
in the kombi. 

But then a good friend gave me some of the real stuff, already bent
perfectly into shape... so I may not find out how easy it is to bend the
stuff to fit.... but it is available.... as is the bulk lengths of the
exact same stuff they used for the regular curtain rods.
