Subject: BBB V in Lake Havasu City Arizona, I can't attend - please send m

Ronnie has asked me to do the web site photo links on his web site for the
pending event... I won't be down in Arizona to take photos myself like 2000,
but 1 year has passed -- more of you have digital cameras, right?

If you have photos, or know of photos on the Internet... please email me (
mailto:Stephen_at_i405_dot_com ) and I will have them up in a matter of hours.
Please provide whatever info you can about the photos too (which day they
were taken, etc.)

Last year we had new photos up every 6 hours or so, it would be great if you
guys with the digital cameras worked with Ronnie and/or VWHoward to get them
sent to me even while the event is still going on.  Also try to get a great
&quot;distant view&quot; of the event show all or most of the campsite against the
lake and mountains.

P.S.  If you missed it: the Type2 list archives are now updated!
http://vw.i405_dot_com/   Other news:  I am working to put together a archive
for the VintagVW list at http://www.vintagevolks_dot_com/ -- it is open, but
still populating the messages.  The _VintagVW list_ is mostly Type1 - but
lots of relevant engine posts!
