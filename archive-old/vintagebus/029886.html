This is another one of those things that comes up every once in a while.
I think in the last round we figured out that there was a time in the
early 60's when the two tones were done top first then bottom. In any
case, I know that my original paint '65 deluxe was painted bottom first,
then top. There's lots of SWR showing through the BG on my roof.

This is another thing the old workers would know. It might have been
decided by whoever was the boss at the time. Or maybe some newly hired
engineer was trying to save a few pfinnig on paint by changing things
around.
