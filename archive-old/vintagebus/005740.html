&gt; dont sell it!!!!! install it in your bus under the package tray and
astound
&gt; people.  you can gets lots of 8 tracks for it too.  they are 69 cents each
at
&gt; the loacal Oly, WA Goodwill

... it's strange that I stumbled into this thread tonight.
Yesterday my wife and I bought an older ('79 in awesome shape) 29 foot
Winnebao RV.  One of the things I saw in it when I was taking it for a test
excursion was an in-dash 8-track player.  The amazing thing is that it still
works (the soon to be PO had a tape with him) !!!

I guess our first trip from Florida will be to the Oly, WA Goodwill.    Can
you get them  to put a hold on them for me, pls??  On second thought maybe
they can transfer them to the Lakeland, FL store.  See what you can work
out.
