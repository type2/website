is anyone interested in a rubber cargo floor mat from a '65 standard?  i am building a custom interior in mine and i have no use for this.  it is in great condition.  it has three small splits in it, each about 1 1/2 inches long, but there is no rubber missing, barely noticeable.  it has the original holes in it for mounting the middle seat.  no dry rot, still very pliable.  im in north central pa if it matters.
peace,
josh
