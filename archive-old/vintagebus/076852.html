Subject: Re: [VB] RGB Gunk, brake backing plate

Hi John,
When you started to take off the brake backing plates you broke into the 
RGBs, so you do need 90 Wt GL-4 gear oil for refilling.  Best to install new axle 
seal kits while you are there.  Drain the center section, then the RGBs.  
Finish the work you are doing and after reinstalling the brake drums and before 
reinstalling the rear wheels fill the RGBs, fill the tranny center section.  
Make sure to check your Bentley Transporter Shop Manual for proper torque values!!
