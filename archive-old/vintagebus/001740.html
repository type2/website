Just wanted to mention four new items that might be of interest:

I received some rear engine lid seals from Europe which are the correct
1-piece, 4-cornered design (as opposed to the generic version that West
Coast Metric sells, which is four strips that you must glue together).
$18.95. 40 available.

I also received some '64-67 rear cargo hatch seals, Mexican made, for
$29.95.  These frankly do not match the fit and finish of the German seals
(which I still have for $99), so I wouldn't call them restoration quality.
On the other hand, this is the first time an inexpensive rear hatch seal has
been available at all, so if $99 is too rich for your blood, you have an
affordable option.   15 available.

Thirdly, I have a small supply of '64-70 brake shoes, front or rear,
original-equipment German Pagid, for $29.95/set.  Until now, original German
shoes have been very expensive or not available at all; the ones typically
sold in the U.S. are resurfaced generics, not new.

Finally, I now have the seat stand mats for walk-thru splitties, for
$34.95/pair, in the stock gray finish.

These prices include listmember discounts.  They will list on the website
for a higher price, but if you specify in the comments section of the order
form that you're a list member the price will be manually adjusted.  Of
course you can also call or e-mail.

Thanks,
