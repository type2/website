Yea, like, send me all your old fasteners and rubber parts. :-)
Help me get the dc on the road.
...although, I'd be glad to pay!!


- I have a '62 front sliding window metal piece that goes under the glass
and has the latch attached to it (non-through glass).  Passenger side I
believe.  The latch is in good shape.  **FOR FREE** (well, ok, gimme
something for shipping)... Or, send me a couple of handfuls of fasteners and
we can call it even.
