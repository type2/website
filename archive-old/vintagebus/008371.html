well cleaning with gas kinda goes hand in hand with engine removal and gas
tank cleaning,sure you have to be careful but you can set the bucket out
side for a few days and all you have left is sludge that you can take to a
disposal center in a jug ,  which makes me wonder what listees do with all
the sludge , paint solvents, paint , oil, etc that come off the restoration?
does it get washed down the drain or what?


&gt; If you have to use a petroleum product to clean parts use kerosene
instead.
&gt; Gasoline is way to combustable, all you need is one spark to flambe
yourself!
&gt;  Try Harbor frieght for thier thick black gloves.
