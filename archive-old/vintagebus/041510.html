&gt; Not that &quot;real&quot; ribbed bumpers are very safe anyway but wouldn't that be
&gt; illegal and unsafe?

Bumpers aren't required in many places.

In places where they are required, they are seldom if ever checked
for strength.

It's quite possible that the fiberglass bumpers are stronger than
the metal ones!
