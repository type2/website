I have to agree with Cameron here. I was lucky enough to pick up a used 250 size complete with bottle in $600 range, and it is the best ive ever used.  From variable heat control to spot and stitch options, it does it all, with never a problem.  Plan on spending the extra money for a quality unit, and you will be thanking us for recomending it.  I don't think you will find a person out there who has spent a little more than they planned on by upgrading to a better unit and is displeased.
