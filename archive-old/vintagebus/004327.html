&gt;&gt;Is there a bus Farmers event this year?
If so where?

Thom wrote---&gt; &quot;No, there's not.

We Sacramentans should make one happen for the Labor Day weekend.&quot;

Concerning the subject of a Bus Farmers/Sacramento Samba Society (NEATO) 
swap meet the day before the bug-o-rama, I thought I should point out a 
few issues. (1) Above all else, this swap meet has failed to be put on 
for over a year because of a LACK of PARTICIPATION among local 
&quot;Sacramentans&quot; and other &quot;area&quot; support. What I mean is, there was an 
apparent unwillingness to devote any time to make it happen. Not because 
of a lack of attendance. With just a handful of people willing to put 
forth the time, effort, and other resources, the meet was put on the 
back burner. (2) There also seems to be a lot of complaining about swap 
space prices, entrance fees etc. The last swap meet under the WX freeway 
was free admission! We (SSS) asked for a simple $1 donation to park your 
vehicle. Sound like a fair if not negligble amount? But you wouldn't 
believe the amount of grumbling that was heard over this &quot;fee&quot;. The SSS 
held monthly, then weekly meetings before the meet date to discuss 
plans. The local Volkswagen &quot;enthusiasts&quot; were invited to attend and 
lend support. The turnout was less than stellar. Folks these shows/swap 
meets are hard to produce, promote, and regulate. There is a significant 
amount of planning, logistics, setup time, and miscellaneous fees to 
consider. This is true for small meets such as the WX swap, and the 
picnic at Ancil Hoffman park, to larger venues such as The Classic, and 
the Bug-O-Rama. This must be considered when forming opinions, let alone 
voicing them in a public forum. Thank you for your time.
