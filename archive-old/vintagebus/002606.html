Hello Everyone

    I have a question of what the value of a 1964  21 window deluxe is now
going for (not Inflated!). It has all its extremities and a second engine
that came out of a Baja bug. The asking price for this bus is 2k with paper
work. It is not in running order right now because it has been sitting for
about 12 years. I know some would say it is worth a dollar and would gladly
come pick it up for its scrap metal value but I think it would make a good
project. It has the usual rust spots but nothing I can see that is panel
replacement material. I know it is not a 23 window but it is a closer step
for me to getting that ultimate dream bus.
