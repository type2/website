Subject: Clutch op shaft Q

I just recieved a bushing kit and operating shaft kit from Bus boys. The
shaft is welded and zinced, and the back of it has holes, not notches for
the throwout bearing clips. The bushing is hefty brass (looks like it won't
fit, and I have to stick with the thin one I already have in good shape,
seems like its aluminum?)
My questions are: Should I use the coiled spring like clips for the
throwout, or the U shaped ones bus boys shipped?
What years used the brass bushings as opposed to the thinner alum ones?
TIA
AL
