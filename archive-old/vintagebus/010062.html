Does anyone have a 1974 or later super beetle that can help me with a wiring
question? I'm trying to install a Motorola alternator (without an internal
regulator) into a '60 single cab. I need to know the location of the
different wire colors going into the alternator. The schematics only show
wire colors going in, but not location. I need someone to look at a car and
tell me what they see. Any wiring geniuses out there?
