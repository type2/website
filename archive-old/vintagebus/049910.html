Subject: Overhead Vent Rehab?


It appears from the archive that one other person posted about this but
it's not clear how he dealt with it.

The vent had quit working (on-off handle wouldn't move) so I took it apart.

There is this big flap with rubber on all four sides that turns the airflow
off and on. This rubber is hanging in shreds. Does anybody repro these
things? I expect I could drill the rivets and cut new rubber from a
printer's blanket and try to button it up again with pop rivets but I'd
rather not have to...

Also there was evidently one other rubber seal, this one is much thicker
but it was laying in the bottom of the vent compartment utterly mangled so
I have no idea where it went. Any ideas?

Thanks,

--Ken
