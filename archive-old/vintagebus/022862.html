The splines on the brazlian one are &quot;keyed&quot; although you have 4 different
positions to pick from, each 90 degrees apart.

&gt;&gt; Seems to me that the splines are sometimes made (on some cars) with one
&gt;&gt; different from the rest, so that there is only ONE way to put the pitman
&gt;&gt; arm on.
&gt;
&gt;You're joking ....right?  The Bentley says nothing re: not ever removing the
&gt;arm.  In fact Section V10 page 3 has a picture of someone pulling the arm off
&gt;with the accompanying removal procedure text.
