There was the Brasilia model, which had a bay front end from the
b-pillars forward, and a split-back end, reminiscent of a 15-window
deluxe.  It also had an upright engine.  The cargo doors were the
same stamping used on barndoors.

&gt; know of Bay's being converted to the Split's doors? Inquiring minds would
&gt; love to know, it'd make an interesting and handy Camper mod.
