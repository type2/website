Subject: Help putting stud in for Thermostat bracket
Date: Wed, 2 Dec 1998 13:50:08 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I posted to the Loaf list and didn't get a response... here is hoping that
the vintagebus list is willing to provide some technical details.

I have a new Brazil AS41 case but it has no provision for a thermostat
bracket.  I want to drill / tap / whatever you call it so I can put a stud
in.

I have never drilled a new hole in metal before, let alone a metric hole.
I'd appreciate any help on telling me what tools I need to purchase and how
to go about doing this.  Details, details, details.

I have another case around that does have the stud, so I can use that as a
point of reference on knowing WHERE to drill the hole.

Thanks.
