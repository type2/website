UPS - cheapest is shipped by ship, takes a few weeks.  Then there's USP Air,
a few days.  The slowest is always the cheapest.  I've had lots of stuff
shipped home while I was working abroad.  I've also sent large packages thru
the regular mail.  It also goes by ship.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
