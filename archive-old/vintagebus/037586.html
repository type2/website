Subject: Turnkey/Fuelinjected Mexican Engines cost
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

We checked this out years ago.......

the complete motor  was not the big expense (but not much cheaper then if 
bought in the USA)

you have to add the computer box (big bucks) ,  wiring harness ,  electric 
fuel pump and all the little things......

these things cost as much as the complete motor......total was way over $3000
