Subject: RE: Replacing Front Trans mount

Thanks to al that sent me advice, heres what happened:

Removed apron, bumper, front and rear trans mount bolts, clutch cable,
accelerator cable, shift coupler, and I dont have heater boxes to worry
about cables.

Tried to move the engine and trans back as one unit using two jacks-
wouldnt budge
Removed engine and tried moving just the trans- still wouldnt budge

I then put jack stands under the torsion tube so the rear wheels were
just off the ground. I unbolted the 8 bolts holding RGBs to springplates
without disconnecting anything else - didnt remove e-brake cable
(although I did release the brake), brake lines, drums, or wheels. I was
then able to slide the trans backwards the required few inches fairly
easily. I was dreading getting those RGBs bolted back up, but it went
fairly smoothly. Since the wheels were still on I was able to use them
to help rotate the bolt holes into place. It took only 15-20 minutes per
side and no swear words.

So there you go, thanks again for the help. I just have to do some misc
stuff today and then well be ready to roll Friday morning.
