Subject: Re: [VB] Emblem Clips?

The West Coast Metric catalog has these speed nuts, on same page as the VW sign

&gt; I have a new emblem for my 55', actually the only emblem I have every had
&gt; for it, and need to know how to make it stay on.  From what I understand
&gt; there are clips for the back, however I have never seen any and am wondering
&gt; what to us.  Is this something that you can purchase from Bus Boys, or
&gt; Ronnie?  Or, can I just get them from a hardware store?  Thanks in advance.
