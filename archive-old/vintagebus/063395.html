&gt;
&gt;another option-i recently started running into problems with the &quot;hot/hard
&gt;start realy&quot; unit i installed in my bus. every know and then i get nothing
&gt;when i try to start the bus. if i crawl underneath and wiggle the wires in
&gt;the relay-it will start.

A cheap way to fix this is to unplug each wire and squish the push-on 
female a bit with a pair of pliers so it grips better.  If the terminal
on the relay is corroded, clean it up with sandpaper or a wire brush.
Plug the wire back in and wrap electrical tape around the push-on and
the relay terminal, covering the end of the push-on.

A slightly fancier way to fix this is to replace the regular push-ons
with fully insulated ones.  On these, the plastic collar around the
crimp area extends all the way up and over the terminal, which helps
to keep gunk out of the connection.  Most FLAPS have them but if not
check the hardware store.

You can tape the fully-insulated terminals, too, or use bulb grease on
them.  Bulb grease is a non-conductive grease that gets used around
light bulb bases on cars to help exclude moisture.  FLAPS sell it in
little tubes, and some (AutoZone) sell it in tiny packets (like a fast
food ketchup packet) that are enough to do one or two bulbs, or one
set of relay terminals.
