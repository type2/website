Subject: Re: [VB] Needed...

That would make it useless as a camper as it would cut
off too much of your air and make it like sleeping in
a sardine can.

&gt; &gt; Greg, let me get this straight, you're taking a
&gt; double door EZ camper and
&gt; &gt; turning it back into a panel?  That seems a bit
&gt; strange, there are plenty
&gt; &gt; of DD panels around, but how many EZ double doors?
&gt;  Are you just pulling
&gt; &gt; our legs?  If you're serious, I'll get you a DD in
&gt; trade for your camper!!
&gt; &gt; It would be much less work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; No joke!! I'm going to keep it a camper, just get
&gt; rid of the windows in the doors. I like the idea
&gt; of having a usable camper but the look of a Panel.
&gt; Being a walk thru as well makes it nice camper
&gt; wise. I'll post some pictures up with a link if
&gt; you'd like to see it.
