YEA BABY!  Chalk the number of magazines that my DoubleCab has been in to 2.
Checkout the DKP Dairy Doodle article in VW Trends.  If you look REAAAALLLLL
close you will see my DoubleCab right behind what is probably me ;-)  If you
think my eye sight is blurred by to many Sam Adams then your probably right
but Matt Souza saw it too so blame him.  If you want to dispute it then do
so with some else privately.
