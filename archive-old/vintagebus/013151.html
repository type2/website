Hey everybody,
Just one of the last few times I'll check out the list as we finish
up the
packing to go on our little road trip down to So.Cal. for the shows
next
weekend.
Me, my wife and two good buds are setting sail Tuesday morning on
our trip
down the coast from Vancouver BC thru Washington, and the beautiful
Oregon
coast and on to LA to have some fun in &quot;the warm California sun&quot; at
Six
flags, Disneyland and two rockin' VW shows that we have been getting
hyped
up over for months!-OCTO and the VW Classic!!
Can't hardly wait. Just as some people on the list were writing, it
would be
cool to meet some of the people that we e-mail back and forth to at
the
shows.
Hey Thom Fitzpatrick, if you read this, maybe it would be an idea to
have a
little registration book or guest book set up somewhere where people
could
meet and hand out for a while.-Just an idea.
To everybody who is going to the shows from somewhere far, I hope
you have a
great trip and we will see you there!

Andy
