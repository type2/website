&lt;&lt; I have a 66 double cab with the 1/3 2/3 seat up front. How many sets of
 seat belts would I have up front?&gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
Well so far we only have seen two seat belts installed up front in either 
factory setups, or aftermarket.  There really is no reason that we can see 
that one could not install three, or even two shoulders, and one center seat 
belt.  Unless you are using factory seat belt mounts, make sure to use huge 
thick washers to reinforce the sheet metal to keep the bolts from pulling 
through in an accident.  When we got our 1960 panel it came with should 
belts, with very tiny outer diameter washers!
 
&lt;&lt;What color do you think they would have been?  &gt;&gt;
If you mean what would have been the factory color it would have depended on 
the interior colors which would have depended on the paint color/s of your 
bus.  If your bus does not have the factory belt points built into it, 
aftermarket belts would have been anything, though hopefully something nice 
to go with the interior.
