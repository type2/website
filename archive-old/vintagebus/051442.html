My dot-com sense tells me they won't be the last.  They certainly weren't
the first, although they're probably the biggest.

I am surprised, as I figured they would have had a more substantial financial
back-end, and could have starved out the smalled shops.  They had the market
footprint, but it looks like they were undersold left and right.  Don't get
me started on the service...

(I'm not an MBA, and I don't play one on TV)
