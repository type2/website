Well, with the Weber progressive I really don't know cause I only like
progressives on V8's. O'course I run a single Weber sidedraft DCOE on my
single just cause I like going to all of the trouble of setting it up.
Anyhow, I ran into these same sort of things, the decent running on one side
and glazed plugs and lousy running on the other when I first put it on the
2275 I built. Terrible thing. By the by, were you running this carb
previously to your satisfaction on this here 1835? Jetting and emulsion
tubes gradually brought mine into line at the higher revs, but as I built
this motor to pull like a black hole at low revs, not for hunderds of
misbehaved ponies at 47 billion rpm's, it required venturi's galore to get
it dialed in. Now it will idle smoothly as low as 550 (just for practice),
but it strangles and gasps at about 5500. Just like I like it since it don't
ever see the north side of 4000 anyway. Started with the 38 mm venturi it
had in its' days as a turbo 1/4 mile single cab (very strange) and ended up
with 28 mms. Happy joy. Single carbs can play favorites with one side of the
engine, especially if you have a separated manifold, as in no plenum joining
the intakes side to side. They also can cause all kinds of nasty problems
due to icing from having no heat riser on the silly morphodite manifolds we
run them on. The gas doesn't like to stay in a vapor in a frozen manifold
and globs of gas running down through the intake and slobbering all over the
plugs isn't what ole Ferdy had in mind when he thought up these little
wonders. I hope this had some redeeming value and if not, consider the
source. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.
