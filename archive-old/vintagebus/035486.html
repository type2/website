Always be cautious when buying new heads, there are 5 different head

manufacturers that I know of in Brazil and Mexico, new duel port heads very

in price from 89.95 up to 125.00 a piece, there is only 1 VW authorized head

manufacturer in Brazil and 1 in Mexico, I have seen the cheap Brazilian

heads blow holes out next to the plugs due to thin casting and the cheap

Mexican heads with different CC's in each cylinder hole. Also the cheaper

heads use valves from Taiwan (even though assembled in Mexico or Brazil).  I

personally use Manley valves as they are excellent quality and made in the U

S A. Most of the valves you see in the rags are made in Israel. TRW valves

you really don't know what you are getting as they are just a repackager and

source their parts from the lowest bidder as long as it meets their specs

(kind of like wheel bearings ), I have received TRW parts, same boxes, same

parts, different countries of manufacturer (again the same as bearings). So

if you are going to buy new heads, look for the VW and/or Audi in the

casting as well as the vw part number and you will be assured at least a

decent head.

so are you aying that the VW/audi  logo on the head mean it comes from a 
better (approved?) manufacturerer/assembler?    some of the new heads have 
different logos, no \X/   or audi (how do you make an audi symbol on this 
keyboard?),  just the P/N and those  are the cheaper makers???     is it a 
different alloys?   cruddy casting?  I have heard different things about 
different new heads and seems everyone has a different opinion.
