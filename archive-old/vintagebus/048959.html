Subject: '65 Double Cab Pics Are Up!

It took me awhile, but I finally got a few snapshots (no digital camera yet) and forwarded them to Everett Barnes, owner of the world famous &quot;VW Planet&quot; webpage.  Everett provides a great service to the VW community by providing free classified webspace for vehicles and parts, in addition to loads of information and pictures.  Thanks Everett!

I had a friend scan the pics and some clarity was lost in that process I think.  But they're good enough to see the pickup and yet cover up some of the tiny flaws that still exist with the bus. :)

You can get to Everett's main page here:

Then go to Classifieds and then scroll down the left side of the page to photo ads.  It's listed as '65 Double Cab.

I think you can get directly to ad here:

The next question is &quot;Why are you selling it after these past two years of agony.&quot;  That alone should answer the question.  Actually, after driving both Single and Double Cabs, I've decided I prefer a Single Cab.  It just fits better with what I need it and use it for.  So, I think I'm going to keep my '60 Single Cab (total project, basket case) and the '59 15W.  That'll keep me busy and happy, for the next five years anyway.

Robert
