What size wrench do i need to buy to take the sipndle
nut off? I don't have my bus with me or i'd check.
depends the year of your beam... does your bus have the easy pry off dust 
caps with the lip or the non lippy kind?   I don't remember the early (no lip) 
size, but the later (lippy cap) is 27mm.   I use 2 wrenches... a 27mm open end 
to hold the inner and a cresent to snug the outer down.   I bought the 27mm at 
a pawn shop for a few bucks, had to grind it thinner so it fit under the lock 
plate.   without holding the inner nut still, it tends to turn when the outer 
nut is snugged, which can mess up the adjustment on the wheel bearing.
