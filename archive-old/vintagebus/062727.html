Subject: Flipseat in 66?

Hey All,

Havn't posted in quite awhile!  Anyway my bus was bought w/ the cab devider 
cut out neatly (if a hack can be neat) w/ all of the non walkthru bulkhead 
in tact.  Would a 62 jumpseat bolt in with minor modifications?  My bus had 
incorect interior to begin w/ and has an early bay westy setup currently.

TIA,

Eric
