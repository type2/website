Subject: Seattle area VW meets this weekend

Hi Volks,
July 14, &amp; 15, the Burger Meet, and Vintage Meet, look like  they are going 
on as scheduled.  The Bugnationals Drag races at  Pacific Raceway looks like it 
is not happening according to thier  calendar.  Plus the Cascade Kombis club 
calander that run both the  Buger Meet, and Vintage Meet not only has no info 
on the Bugnationals, but they  have another Meet scheduled for Sunday at the 
old San Point Naval Base on  Sunday the 16.  For more info check out:
