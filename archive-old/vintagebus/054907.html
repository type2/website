Subject: Re: [VB] 40 HP lives!!!

.006 should be fine, and .008 won't hurt it either (I've seen some engine
builders run em even looser during engine break-in, then set them right
after the valves 'tighten up', but I don't suggest doing this).  I would
probably look at the fuel you're using, remember that those engines were
meant for Leaded fuel.  I run some Marvel Mystery Oil in my super unleaded
gas (to help simulate LEADED fuel, because the lead lubricated the top end
of the engine), even though I have unleaded heads. The engine probably
doesn't need it, but I guarantee it doesn't hurt to keep the top end
lubricated, and may cause the engine to last longer.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; Well I got the 40 HP that I &quot;half&quot;  built in the 64 started and running
today!  It actually sounds pretty strong.  There just seems to be a lot of
valve noise.  Can anyone tell me the right valve clearances for the 40 HP?
The manuals all say that the setting should be .006&quot; for all type 1 engines,
but I think I heard somewhere that you should set them at .008&quot; for the 40
HP.  Anyone know if this is true?  Would the setting beiong off .002&quot; cause
excessive valve chatter or is it more likely that the noise is just because
the engine has been sitting for about a year?
