Subject: reduction box sealant

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C18268.CD0EE680

I am putting the reduction boxes for my bus (big nut) together and I need=
 to know what is the sealant of choice for the reduction box halves(i hav=
e the gaskets already). I also need to know what sealant to use for the l=
arge freeze plug on the rear (butts up to the spring plate). I use curil =
for the engine case halves and it doesn't leak- will this work for the re=
ar end as well? I know how bad the tranny fluid smells and only want to d=
o this once. Thanks.
