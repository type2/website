Hi all
Many thanks are in order for the Great Time My Dad and I had at the Buses by
the Balloons &quot;Tour&quot;
We left Cambridge Ontario,, encouraged by Cletus, to come have fun in
Albuquerque!
WHICH WE DID!!
I met some funny guys,,, Like VW Howard!!  John was great guy,,, cooks very
well too! I have to agree with his statement..quote &quot;All I can say is what a
GREAT SHOW. Small enough to meet everyone and big enough to not get bored.
There is really no way to describe the mass balloon accents every morning,
pictures dont even come close.&quot; and Ronnie from Old Volks Home is very
Friendly.. but he gave me an A --  on my bus,,, what was wrong with it
Ron,,,, the Canadian Flag too large??
And Richard and Dawn had the best sense of humour even when their bus was
Rockin all night,,, I dunno who was doing that!!! hahahaha  I liked the neon
light of the Rusty Bus!
So many stories came from that fire pit,, J.P.  had a great time!
I think I may be able to talk my dad into a Double Cab,, He is even using
the term correctly now!
My Dad got along so well with some others that had similar background
memories, Like Gert and Jim, who by the way , gave us some great driving
directions for the trip home.. you guys even trained DAD about the
difference of a Barn door and a double door!!!  Good Work!
I really shouldn't have started to thank people by names as I didn't
remember all the folks names... there were so many good people,,  email me
if you met me!!  :-)
but the one person that I have to really thank is Dave Russell , from
Colorado springs..... he came to the &quot;airs&quot; rescue for me and helped out my
fuel problem!  That darn fuel pump is fixed now! I made it to his house by
shear luck and He took the time to help me out and lend me his garage and
tools that I didn't bring with me,
No Quarter's home was opened for us and we felt so welcome in Nebraska!  It
seems to be a way of Volks! people that you can have fun and trust them!
I had alot of great conversations with people,, about buses, bicycles, toys,
and travel,etc, very diverse topics that entertained and educated me! This
trip was so worthwhile,, life experiences that can only be found with such
generous people!
Thanks from My dad and I ,,,,, he is busy telling the stories! :-)
And don't forget the spectacular Balloons and the VW show !  The effort put
forth by the club was evident,, I didn't hear 1 single complaint... other
than the length of the spud gun demonstration!!  hahahaha! I really enjoyed
the Awards trophies,, hand made and very unique,,, I recieved the Long
Distance award,, an Early bus dash with the speedo set to 1948 miles...
equivalent to the 3246 kms that  We drove.
Btw I have pictures if you want,,
