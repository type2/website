Subject: Re: [VB] Flasher Relay help needed

djohnson1_at_snet_dot_net writes:   &lt;&lt; The one currrently in there (aftermarket) has 
three prongs, but no apparent ground.  I've checked all catalogs, but don't 
see any relays listed for 65 with emergency flasher. &gt;&gt;

Hi Don,
Often with aftermarket three prong signal flasher relay one has to hook two 
of the wires to one of the prongs on the realy whiel the third wire goes to a 
one of the remaining prongs.  If you can describe the markings at each prong 
you are using we might be able to help if it matches what we are using.
