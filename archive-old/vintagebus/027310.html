Subject: Westy interior?

Hello all,

I posted the other day about templates for Westy interior and have yet
to see anything, is there such an animal?  If not, is there anybody in
the Ventura, Santa Barbara, LA cnty area that wouldn't mind me looking
at their interior? I really want to make a camper interior for my bus, I
don't care if it's &quot;original scandanavian birch harvested from the
stoutest trees in the land&quot; I just want it to be functional, good
looking, and at least the correct shapes.
    Any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Jon 65 standard that want's to be a camper
