The official show is Sunday October 17 -- gates open at 9:00am.  There tends
to be a lot of stuff going on Saturday as people are setting up cars for car
show, parts for parts selling, and so forth.  For those who haven't been,
this isn't really much in the way of &quot;fest&quot; show... there isn't any food or
anything special of note.... but it is an indoor car show and swap meet.
Tends to have big attendance due to being the last show of the season..

For directions to the event... go to http://www.thefair_dot_com/ web site.  If
you are interested in the car show or swap selling, here is the contact
information for the organizers of the event:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Oktobugfest at the Puyallup Fairgrounds in Puyallup from 9:00 am to

Perhaps I'm confused but there may be two different proposed camp sites.
Anyway, Tristan and I will be camping starting at 6:30pm and will likely fix
dinner on-site.  Will likely bring some drinks as this is one of those
Saturday nights with no driving :)  If you get lost or need help, my cell
phone is (206) 972-7820.  Dan posted this map link if you want to know
exactly where we are at:

  --- Here is a map of the fairgrounds... the camp area is at
  --- the top of the map (marked RV lot).

Hope to see some of you Saturday night or early Sunday morning :)
