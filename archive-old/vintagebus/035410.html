&lt;&lt;  I can't seem to find a manual for my 60. The Bentley manuals I see are
 for 63 and later.Where can I get the one I need?Thanks, shawn
  &gt;&gt;
you cant.  sorry.

VW made Transporter workshops Manuals -first one published in 1953, then 
updated versions in 1955 (for your non barndoor) 1959, and 1963.  (I suppose 
they kept making new versions after that)   These were originally made for 
internal use within the VW organisation.   And contain warning about letting 
outsiders have them.   At least some were printed by Richard Borek KG, 
Braunschweig  Hahn-Druckererei GmbH, Hannover.

What people refer to as the Bentley, is a reprint of teh 1963 edition of the 
transporter Workshop Manual.  It covers 63 through 67 buses.     Do get it, 
it covers your front suspension, brakes, rear suspension, and quite a lot in 
between.   If you want the 1959 edition, search swap meets and look for them, 
you can sometimes find an original copy.  But I dont think they were 
published by Bentley.

I think it is wonderful that VW and Bentley have responded to the rise in 
popularity of the splitties by reprinting the 63 version.   It really is the 
best easily availble manual you can get.
