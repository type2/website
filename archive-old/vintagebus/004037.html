Okay, here's the drill

Citric Acid: present in citrus fruits, an organic acid used to make many
instant drinks (like Kool-Aid) tart.

Hydrochloric Acid: HCl, also called muriatic acid,  stomach acid, swimming
pool acid, metal prep. an inorganic and very powerful acid

Ants contain acetic acid, also known as vinegar.

Chemistry background doesn't come in handy on this list very often.
