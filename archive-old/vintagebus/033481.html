&gt;When I went to my local NAPA, they not only did NOT have GL-4, but gave me a

My experiace with NAPA is that the counter guys can be idiots. I had a guy 
tell me to my face that they didn't and never did carry the stuff, right as 
I was pulling it off the shelf not 3 ft. from his ridiculous fat face. He 
didn't even act emabarressed when I said, &quot; here it is right here&quot;.

That being said, I have found that NAPA is REAL good about having parts 
other guys don't. But usually the price will reflect it. If I'm buying 
local, I go to Autozone first to look for a part since they're cheap and 
then work my way around til I end up at NAPA last. I can usually count on 
them having the part if I'm willing or HAVING to pay.
