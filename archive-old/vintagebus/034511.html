Dan,
    I have a customer with an Oval that works at a chrome shop here in Eugene,
Oregon.  He never has any money, but does have a fairly good sized lunch
box...hence I trade parts for chroming.  It's flat amazing what he can do!
Rusted, ugly, no problem!  As for cost I have no idea, but I gather it's
pretty spendy.  My next project for him is a set of bus pedals.
    As for mailing in your chrome, you might what to pick up an issue of
Hemming's Motor News, I remember seeing probably a good dozen mail in chrome
places.
    Peace, Love, and I never let chrome till I started getting it almost for
free,
          Mr. Bubble Head
