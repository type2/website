&gt;diana, check your shocks out, most shocks are made to work in one
&gt;position
&gt;with the shock upside down the internal valving might not function
&gt;right, 

&gt;a cheap way to cover the shock to protect it is to get an old bike 
inner
&gt;tube 

Ronnie,
I think the KYBs are OK upside down, the bus certainly rides a lot 
better than ever.  I'll ask the off-roaders though.  Just enjoying the 
sunshine this week - next week I think I'll do the inner tube thing.  
Thanks for the tip.  
Diana
