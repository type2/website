&gt; If I understand correctly, 185-75R14 means, 185mm wide, the height is
&gt; 75% of the width, and fits a 14&quot; rim.
&gt; So to calculate overall tire diameter the formula is
&gt; (185mm*0.75*2)/10/2.54 + 14&quot; or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; What is an 185R14 ?  Is there a default if the %height is left out,
like
&gt; 80% or something like that?

You got it!  Except that the default is sometimes 78, 80, 82, or 85
depending upon who is defining it.  For old bias ply tires the default
ratio was 100.

Tire sizes also only have to fall within a &quot;range&quot; of measurements, so
different tires of the same size can vary quite a bit in actual
dimensions.  Don't calculate to the gnat's eyelash and expect the tire
to match your calcs!

My 185R14s measure 146mm in section height (inner circumference of
bead to outer circumference of tread) when mounted and inflated.  This
works out to a 79 section ratio.

&gt; Sorry for the basic question.  Couldn't find anything in the archives.

No such thing as a basic question.  There are only questions that need
answering!
