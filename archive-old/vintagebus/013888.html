&gt; Here's one I'll bet you guys missed:
&gt; May '99 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan,&quot;
&gt; pages 253 &amp; 254.
&gt; White/Orange, 23window, 1961 Fla license:  1-48068.
&gt; Looks like a very recent resto.
&gt; See if you can find it.

I saw it.  Too bad they had that fashion model laying all over it

Oh, that's the point of Cosmo, isn't it?  :)
