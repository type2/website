As long as the late style Type 1 transaxle is a '71
then you can swap the T/O bearing and clutch disc
styles.  This is because the early style uses the 
'small' shaft clutch T/O bearing arm and the '71,
while it is the later supported T/O bearing also 
uses the small diameter shaft.  Anything later
will use the larger diameter throw out arm and,
while you can convert the trans to the early style,
you cannot get a early style large diameter clutch
arm!
