Well,

If he installed a New or &quot;NOS&quot; reserve valve rather than an original one,
the positions are reversed according to recent list reports...

So if he has one of those and his knob in the main position as instructed
in the owners manual he is actually driving around on reserve all the
time.

This is my guess as to what is happening here.

take care,

Steve
