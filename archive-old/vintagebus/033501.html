Did we napalm all the militia and racists and Turner Diary readers after 
Oklahoma?

&gt; &gt; In the event of this again this year I

&gt;
&gt;Very good idea, and remember that the reason this all
&gt;happened, is that there is too much hate in the world
&gt;today. Before we take revenge, keep in mind that
&gt;violence begets violence, hate begets hate. Keep a
&gt;cool head, mourn those who died, and wait for the
&gt;truth to out!

&gt;Religious zealots are the problem today; love your

&gt;misguided.
