Subject: Re: [VB] Sloppy Steering - was Tie Rod Replacement

&gt;Hey All,
&gt;
&gt;I'm gonna have to replace the non adjustable tierod on my bus soon and
&gt;noticed that you can get an adjustable tire rod for the passenger side as
&gt;well.  This would seem advantagous, I think the adjustable one is even
&gt;cheaper via busboys.  Any reason why I should not go adjustable on both
&gt;sides?


 I have these on my bus - I see no reason why you wouldn't want to do this
- makes toe-in adjustments a snap!
