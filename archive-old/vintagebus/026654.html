&lt;&lt; The really fast and easy way to stop squeels coming from a glazed drum is
 to take a butter knife and put some dry powdered &quot;Comet&quot; cleaner inside
 your drum through the adjusting slot.  Problem solved, no squeel and the
 comet will just fall out of the brake after doing it's job.  And best of
 all, you don't have to remove the drum!! &gt;&gt;
Hi Rick,
Well actually the shoes get a glass glaze over them and not the drums.
Though the Comet will probably do the job of removing the glaze off of the
shoes.  We are a little worried that this would increase rust since the
chlorine part of Comet is simular to what is in Sodium Chloride (Common
salt!).  Is there a chemist in the list that can tell us!
  If the front brakes are glazing it could be due to bad flex lines or no
play between the brake push rod and the MC piston and thusly no release of
hydralic pressure.  Once the problem is fixed any glazed brakes will cure
themselfs if they are applied correctly (No dragging the brakes for long
distances.) while driving.  Eric&amp;Barb
