I got a phone call at work this morning from the Conway County,
Arkansas Sherrif's Department asking if I had worked on a woman's
'71 bus on Thursday or Friday. She was found dead in a rest area
on I-40 near Conway. Apparently she was having some trouble with
her bus on a cross country trip and someone she knew had given
her my name from the AIRS list. I didn't get a call from her.
The investigators are looking for any information they can get
on this case. If you know anything at all about a 25 year old
woman traveling West on I-40 in a '71 bus with two dogs, please
contact Cleve Keeling at (501) 354-2411.

I hope this isn't the first notice of this to any of her friends.
I know the family has been notified. My sincere condolences to
family and friends.
