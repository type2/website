Hi all,

Thanks to &quot;No Quarter&quot;, you can view his e-version of the postal event
flyer for more info on this upcoming weekend's &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The
Arch #16&quot;.  The response has been huge, we should be buried in Type 2's on
Friday evening.  The flyer briefly explains the event, and Erin has
provided a link to the proper &quot;Mapquest&quot; regional map for the event. 
Caution: if you print out the &quot;Mapquest&quot; map for use in getting to the
event, be sure to use the flyers' printed instructions to reach the
campground.  Idiosyncrasies in Mapquest would not allow Erin to place the
location &quot;red star&quot; in the actual location of the event on Mark Twain Lake.
 It's about 4 to 5 miles off.  So, pay no attention to the &quot;red star&quot; as a
locater, and use the directions on his web site and you'll arrive safe and
sound at the largest gathering of Type 2's in the Midwest!  Remember to
arrive in a VW, because only VW's will be admitted into the event
campground!

Thanks again to Erin for hosting the event flyer.  Many of us are looking
forward to meeting him in person, and checking out his Bus and the new
engine we've been reading about !  You'll find the flyer on his site at:

We can't wait to see everybody!

p.s.  Could someone who is on the Vanagon List forward this to them?  Thank
you!
