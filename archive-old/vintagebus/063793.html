Subject: Re: hole in heater tube

I want to go back to Kevin's question about the heater tube for a
minute:

&gt;the heater tube under the front floor pan, or actually right where it
&gt;king of turns up to go into the front compartment, on one side there
&gt; is a whole.

Ray said cover it with duct tape.  Matt Roberts said it's not stock and
agreed with Ray.

I'm not clear on where Kevin found this &quot;hole&quot; which he described as
half cut out like not going through with a cookie cutter.  I'm going to
throw out one more idea for good measure.  If it's on the right side,
about 6&quot; in front of where the heater tube comes through the cross
member, it could be where a cut-out for double cab rear seat heat hose
would attach.

From the description it could have been stamped like an electrical box
&quot;knock out&quot; and removable if the heater tube was going into a double
cab.  There's also a strange flat spot in the &quot;toe space&quot; behind the
front seats in a non-walk-thru bus.  It's covered with the rubber mat,
glued vertically.  I always wondered about it--until I acquired a double
cab.  That's where the other end of the heater tube goes to distribute
heat to the rear seat.

I didn't want to remove the heater tube insulation on my other busses to
check on this, but I think it would explain what Kevin found.
