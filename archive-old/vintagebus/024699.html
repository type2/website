Subject: RE: Ignitions and engine kits

Russ,

Check the archives (http://www.type2_dot_com/) on engine kits. Bob Hoover
has a recent public reply to a question on JCWhitney's rebuild kit that
is worth considering regardless of the &quot;rebuild kit&quot; you choose. There
has also been recent discussion of ignition upgrades (electronic vs
points replacement) that should answer your ignition question. In fact,
there's been good discussion regarding where your head's at with 20 cars
following you up the hill!

My engine experience is limited to stock 1500cc, 1600cc, and BB 1641cc
displacements, SP &amp; DP (mostly the latter), running stock stroke and
relatively stock components. I &quot;4 wheel&quot;, camp, and pull my sailboat &amp;
family all through the mountains of Utah with this configuration and it
works for me. 

I've been researching building a larger engine and may do a 1776cc with
stock stroke. I've never considered stroking a daily driver, due to the
increased machine work/tolerances (1776 already requires opening the
cylinder holes on the case). I'm curious what the list thinks about
this. I guess you're increasing displacement either way, but it seems
that increasing stroke would raise the CR unless some serious shimming
was done. Is there an advantage to increasing stroke vs increasing P&amp;C
diameter?

Inquiring minds want to know!

&gt; It's new engine time here and I'm looking for information about who has good
&gt; quality engine kits. I know Gene Berg has great stuff but I only have about
&gt; $2000 to work with. What I would like to put together is basically a stock
&gt; motor with a stroker crank. I'm not looking for a high rpm monster, i'd
&gt; rather it not even see 4000 rpm. Just looking for good solid parts and
&gt; workmanship. We do a lot of camping, and climbing the hills at 25-35 mph
&gt; with 20 cars behind me honking is getting a little upsetting. I saw in HVW
&gt; that Scat sells kits and thought they might be good, but could use some
&gt; input from other people. Also regarding electronic ignitions, any oppinions
&gt; on which one, I'm willing to spend a few bills on a good one if they exist,
&gt; are the compu-fire complete systems any good?
