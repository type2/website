hello all,

I have kept out of public comments on Busdepot in the past, but thought it
was a worthwhile endeavor to say what i had to say.

Every single order i have ever placed had at least something wrong with
it.  Now, thats all okay and they were very willing to fix things, but i
am not so good at getting around to sending stuff back, so i have ended up
with extra parts that i have absolutely no use for. So, for me, knowing my
tendency to never send things back i end up coming out worse by having to
buy the cheaper part twice, it would be better for me to have to pay a tad
more and end up with the right thing. Plus, at least in my experience, ron
has never offered to pay return shipping even when the error was obviouly
the fault of busdeopt.

I tend now to buy most things from the in-town VW specialist.  I go there
about once a month so i can set the bag with stuff to be returned in my
bus and just return it next time i end up there. They are pretty dune
buggy oriented, so i end up having to still buy a lot of bus specific
stuff mail-order.

I am sure i will buy from busdepot again, their prices are quite
good.  But i will have to be careful to order by VW part number only... as
that should reduce the errors. In the past i had expected the order takers
to have even a rudimentary knowledge of vw's, which proved not to be the
case.

just my $0.02

p.s. to ron, i have noticed you are always hiring it seems, high turnover
at a job usually indicates too low of pay or difficult working
conditions.  Perhaps if you paid more or had more people (a load shared is
a load reduced) turnover would be lower and people would stay long enough
to actually learn what part fits what vw. If this resulted in slightly
higher prices most would pay... keeping customers happy and unfrustrated
is the most important part of a business... If a customer gets frustrated
enough they will go elsewhere even if they have to pay more. I know in my
case, had there not been so many problems with my previous orders, i
probably would have sent a lot more of my business your way.
