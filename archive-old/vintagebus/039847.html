I'm nearing completion on my '67 deluxe restoration, and I'm running into a 
few stock-related issues.  I have a lot of detailed questions as to what 
goes where.  What I need are some pictures of everything in/out of a deluxe 
(lot simpler than asking you all on here a million questions).  Does anyone 
know a site with a load of pictures detailing every inch of a deluxe?
thanks,
-Wes
