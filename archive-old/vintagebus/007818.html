I just cleared the nose of my 64. Can you imagine that the whole thing was
covered with bondo? It looks like it had a tire mount up front at some point
since there are four decent size holes in it. It's cracked too and it looks
like it was damaged pretty good. Someone drilled hundreds of holes, rather
punched these holes from inside to pull it out and just because of these
holes it had so much filler. I would rather toy with it as it is than
replace the nose sheet. What I need to know is this: 1.) can I buy side
bumper brackets? the ones on mine have been shaved;
2.) is there a difference in rear wheel wells between Split and early Bay? I
think I've seen like 69 or 70 Bay at a local junk yard;
3.) I've heard talk about pans to cover front undercarriage components, what
is it called and was it available for a 64?
I'm kind of in a cold now since I don't have any books that would explain
things to me. Seams that every time I bid on one of them someone is
outbidding me.
Thanks for al your help.
Photos of the nose would be posted to my site soon. Check it anyway, address
is below.
