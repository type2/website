Hi,
Keep calling all of the other local tire shops.  This unfortunitly is the
first question when shopping for tires you should ask.  Someone has to have
the adapter.  We had to do the same thing and finally found one shop in
Olympia WA that had it.  Plus you might want to post your location and
someone near you might know the ansewer to this quest.
