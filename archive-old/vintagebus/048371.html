Thanks,

 OK, so I have a range of 1 to 4 or whatever.  I guess i will put it up on 
e-bay and see what gives.   Thanks again.  And yes,  they do grow on trees 
because the reason I am selling this one is I have another one with the big 
opening for the bus. Dont need two and I could use the dough.....
