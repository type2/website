what's you oil pump? Did you blueprint the pump? That's good for a lot of
pressure at idle if you have a loose pump!

&gt; I wonder how many listees push delete when they see my address.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the replies. I tried to respond to each or to the list.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway,
&gt; Today I put in a mechanical pressure gauge and at start up the pressure
was
&gt; 50 psi. I put in the electric sender and mounted the gauge up front. The
&gt; pressure on the gauge agreed at start up and took for a drive. By the time
I
&gt; got to about 200 degrees the pressure was more like 20 psi and at idle of
&gt; around 900 rpm (a guess), down to 4-5 psi, and the light was flickering
&gt; again.
&gt;
&gt; Flaps was sold out of new oil pressure springs until next week so for
grins
&gt; I shimmed them .120 inch and repeated the test drive. I put 40w oil in
again
&gt; as I did not want to change two things at once. Same sorry results. The
oil
&gt; pump is new and if it was faulty, would I have great startup pressures?
&gt;
&gt; When I rebuilt this puppy everything that could me micced was, and
&gt; plastigauge used where it could be used. I had to trust the machine shop
on
&gt; # 3 main as was put on before I got it back from them.
&gt;
&gt; When this case was last running in the 71DP, it ran hot but I never had
any
&gt; &quot;oil light on&quot; indication of poor pressure.
&gt;
&gt; Other notes: The oil does not smell like gas.
&gt; I think the vibrations may be a combination of factors as is not
&gt; reproducible when the bus is not rolling. May have to get worse then be
&gt; obvious??
&gt;
&gt; Any more thoughts?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; History: New rebuilt 1600 SP engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After 20-minute run in and then a short 5-mile drive, I waited until
today
&gt; &gt; to readjust the valves cold. All were loose except one. They were set at
&gt; &gt; .006 before run in and short drive. Today were .009 to .013. The one
&gt; &gt; exception was .004. I figured the opposite would be found today. All
were
&gt; &gt; set back to .006.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I took her on a road trip to continue the break-in today. Nice
&gt; &gt; conditions with hilly roads some stop lights. Many different rpms and
&gt; &gt; speeds, up and down moderate hills (except Boyd Smith's driveway- a
&gt; mountain
&gt; &gt; goat would get winded). After about 20-25 miles, I pulled into my dad's
&gt; &gt; driveway and at idle, the oil light started to flicker. It would go away
&gt; &gt; when revved a bit. The temperature was only about 210 degrees. After the
&gt; &gt; drive back, this did not occur, but is had cooled outside and the
&gt; &gt; temperature only went up to about 180. Any ideas about that?
&gt; &gt; This may seem very paranoid (build an engine for the first time and I
dare
&gt; &gt; you to not be that way), but the bus *seemed* to use more gas looking/
&gt; &gt; watching the gauge. I wonder if some gas is getting into the oil to make
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; thinner. How can I tell? After the 20 min. run in, I changed the oil and
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; *seemed* thin (very unscientific I know but I have changed the oil when
&gt; warm
&gt; &gt; before).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also appear to have an engine vibration at a certain RPM. I am
&gt; &gt; disappointed with that as I had the whole thing balanced at the machine
&gt; &gt; shop. I have no tach installed so can not tell exactly what engine speed
&gt; &gt; this occurs. Occurs at about 28mph in third gear and about 40 mph in
&gt; fourth.
&gt; &gt; I guess I will have to live with that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TIA for any input!
