Hi Folks -

Derrick's recent tale reminds me to post this:

On my swing axle type 1, which had been rebuilt by the now retired 'last 
guy in town rebuilding them', I had similar symptons:

 &gt;&gt;The knocking seems to be coming from the tranny. ....
Also, I learned today that the sloppy knocking is aparent in 3rd as well
when I let off the gas in low rpm's.  ...
almost as if the tranny moved forward or to the side a little b) it feels
like the whole rear end is gonna fall off! Like maybe everything is behind
held together by a single bolt. ...&lt;&lt;

In my case, with the vehicle up on jack stands, the motor/tranny were 
shaking like a nightmare rhumba.

When we finally got it apart, we found that George hadn't paid attention to 
the worn (sharpened) edges of the inboard axle flanges.  Within three 
weeks, one of these had gouged into the full length oiling ditches machined 
into the oversized fulcrum plates until it had a good enough purchase to 
break the fulcrum plate in half and proceeded to try to grind it into 
particles - fnugling the side gear, spider shaft and carrier in the 
process.  The ring and pinion escaped.

In this case, I ordered up a set of good used axles from Weddle Eng. along 
with a super diff, 4 new spiders and good used German side gears, along 
with the proper shims.  Btw, they are knowledgeable, easy to do business 
with, have a very useful catalog and were fast with the shipping.  $374 
later we finaled it and it's now smooth as a kimono on a warm night.  The 
only special tools needed were a vernier caliper to measure the width of 
the old carrier and side shims (we ordered the new shims after measuring 
the new diff), a factory bearing puller which proved useful twice after we 
discovered we had switched axle tubes during installation, and some 
grinding on a pair of needle nose pliers for the hd snap ring on the new 
diff.  We pressed on both sets of bearings using a small hammer and correct 
drift(s) using the katinka katinka method.

More later,  Nick..
