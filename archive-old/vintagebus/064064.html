Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

I have not gotten my repro taillights as of yet but I did save the pieces of the old ones. I took it
all apart, cleaned it and am now in the process of looking for bulb sockets to fit these old light
buckets. It's not easy but I am confident that one day I will stumble upon one that will fit. Both
glass pieces..... I should say all four glass lens pieces are there too. I even saved screws
although these don't appear to be original. I won't sell this lot, I'll be on a lookout for
replacement parts..... You never know when I might need them again...... knock on wood.

peace,
