    Another paint that is durn near dead on: Duplicolor Blue White in
the &quot;Truck &amp; Van&quot; paints... I'm using it on my '63...  I brought a piece
of steel painted with it to my buddy's body shop supply to see how close
it was.  First he mixed a small batch of VW Blue white according to
paint code, then he used his color analyzer to match the Duplicolor
painted panel...  said the resulting mixing formulas were very near
identical...

    I pay around $4 a can for 20oz. size at Walmart.  4-5 cans will
cover the bus above the beltline with several coats... the nice thing is
for touch-ups you don't need to run the paint supply to pay $12-$15 for
a pint of matching paint (if they are even open on a Sunday).


        Now if I could only find Turquoise for the bottom of the Bus or
NOS Como Green interior panels...  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;
