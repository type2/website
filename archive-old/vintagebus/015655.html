I've seen one better: cars FA (for auction) where you're not bidding on
the *car*, you're bidding on the &quot;finder's fee&quot; - the car is a fixed price,
which is stated in the item description.  So when commission-time rolls around,
the commission is based on a couple hundred dollars and not several thousand.

&gt; Basically, this is a schmoes way to set a reserve and not pay extra fees from ebay for listing and final calculation bids.
