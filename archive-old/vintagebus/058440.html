Subject: [VB] Re: front seal

That's weird. If you were using the original bottle cap steel cam plug, it
shouldn't have fallen out. It has a fairly large ridge around it that
mates with a deep ridge in the case. If it was installed properly, it would
take a lot of effort to get it back out without damaging the case. I have
seen blocks with the cam plug glued on on the outside when the builder
forgot to install it when he/she put the case halves together.
