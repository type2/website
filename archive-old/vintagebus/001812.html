I'm completely blind when it comes to this. It's a learning process. I've
got an engine which is incomplete. I would like to rebuilt it but first I
need to know what it is. Up, on the front it has these numbers stamped: AK
104966. Now the alternator and starter are both 6V so I assume it's an early
bus or bug engine but which one?
Is it that difficult to convert it to 12V? That's what I'd like to do.

Thanks.
