If I'm reading this right, you have an engine case intended for a fuel
injection setup, but are actually running with a carburetor.  The fuel
circuit is tank -&gt; electric pump -&gt; regulator -&gt; carburetor.

It is possible that this is the problem.  Ideally, you'd check the
actual output pressure of the regulator, and compare it to the spec
for the mechanical fuel pump.  There's probably some way of adapting a
tire gauge to this task (most people don't have gasoline-proof
pressure gauges), but it's not coming to mind at the moment.

Are the settings on the regulator of the LOW&lt;--&gt;HIGH form, or in
something useful like pounds/inch or the metric equivalent (Nm, I
believe)?  If the latter, then just verify your selected pressure
against Bentley or the VW shop manual's spec for whatever engine
you've got.  Well, whatever engine it's pretending to be, in terms of
displacement - obviously, they aren't going to have specs for a fuel
injection setup, and that's not what you're running anyway; just look
for &quot;1600cc&quot; or whatever.  I believe the usual rating is 2-3 ft/lbs(?).

Where do you have fuel filters?  In a setup like this, you'd want one
before the electric pump, and none after.  If you've got one after,
the high pressure of the pump could damage it, and constrict the
flow.  Having one between the regulator and the carb wouldn't hurt,
and might help.

:  What is this?

Several others have answered this item.  Most likely not the problem,
although I remember at least one listee having this missing and large
chunks were indeed landing on the fuel take-off, blocking flow
completely at random times.
