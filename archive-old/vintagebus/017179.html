Subject: bent pop top pole
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

does anybody know what kind of shop would have the
ability to bend a steel pole back to straight? i.e. -
muffler shop, body shop? the pole basically works like
a pole for a outdoor table umbrella. it has a skinnier
pole inside a thicker pole with a ball-and-hole to pop
it into place. it is made of treated(?) steel. it is
bowed. i don't know how it happened. it was out of the
bus when it happened. i have a roommate... oh well,
doesn't matter how it happened. how can i get it
fixed?
thank you,
casey
