Subject: Pomona-Rain-Westy hitch

The rains do come to Pomona---after 21+ years of doing Pomona  we left
wet early sunday morning-- The Westy hitch i brought out--was finally
determined to be for a Type I--sorry not type II!! but a great story
just the same--I found a buyer for the Westy hitch--we cleaned off the
brass ID Westy plate and found it was stamped 1963--and further marked
type15. The buyer is Sean  who owns a 1963 VW cabrio. that you will be
able to see this year at Kelly Park. So after years of this hitch
sitting in my garage--i bring it out once to sell and it ends up on a VW
from the same year the hitch was made!!
If Herbie our 62 Love bug ever found out--he would be P-----!! it was
right along side of him in the garage--
Of note for sale in Pomona==a very cool 71 single cab made from a
bus--XXLLNNTT body work! the back window was the back hatch  wooden
bed--the &quot;gates&quot; were the sides of the bus cut down--they will not fold
down----2180 GB motor--dove blue--price was $7,200--And from the looks
of it--if you are into Bus Customs--this is a cool single cab--show
quality every where--the workmanship very nice.!!this was a good show to
buy at due to the rain--but a lot of the sellers stayed home--total
miles driven 787 miles--
after 21+ years of doing Pomona every 5 or 6 weeks--this is a lot of
miles!! But you have to keep looking--&quot;they' are always out there! TWWM,
uj
