After smacking my head on that nice all metal dash while trying to install my
blaupunkt radi a few questions have come to mind.

1. was the speaker on the bus installed regardless of whether a radio was
ordered (i know radios were usually installed by the dealer)

2. which leads to question 2- if a speaker was installed independednt of the
radio was small phillips screw inserted roughly 2&quot; to the right of the ash
tray to keep the speaker housing from falling backwards? i have a 1967 factory
manual that shows a bus w/ this screw but dunno if this is correct for a 65'
(can you tell i don't like drilling holes??)

3. which leads to question 3 is the metal speaker bracket different on a 1967
bus than a 1965?? 

inquiring minds want to know :)

michael (dash currently all torn apart.. joy!)
