Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

That is true but the top speed of the bus is
approximately the same or near what the speed limit is
for trucks in most states.  

It is much harder to get and expensive to get a
driver's license in Germany, as you state.  I really
think that there should be a better screening process
here as well.  In Chicago I notice that nobody uses a
turn signal or stops for stop signs.  There needs to
be more education and a way to make bad drivers take
public transportation.  I have even seen cars blow red
lights in front of Chicago Police and nothing happens.
 Perhaps there was a more important call at Dunkin
Doughnuts.  :-)

&gt; 
&gt; I disagree with you to some extant. Though I do feel
&gt; it is proper to
&gt; move to the right lane when driving slower. But even
&gt; in the right lane,
&gt; a speed that is drastically lower than the overall
&gt; flow pattern can be a
&gt; hazard. I doubt that five miles under the speed
&gt; limit would likely be a
&gt; hazardous situation but it could be if the traffic
&gt; on that road is
&gt; speeding. Of course, this would be a situation where
&gt; the speed limit
&gt; should be changed, but thats not likely to happen.
&gt; More likely that the
&gt; police will set up radar there and present a road
&gt; hazard themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; In Germany, they start teaching children the rules
&gt; of the road in
&gt; Kindergarden. They get additional &quot;drivers ed&quot; every
&gt; year throughout.
&gt; Here in the states, drivers ed has been cut in many
&gt; states do to lack of
&gt; funds. It's no wonder that many can't drive or even
&gt; think.
&gt; 
&gt; If I had to make a long haul on a highway where I
&gt; knew the traffic
&gt; pattern was fast and there were many trucks, I might
&gt; buy or borrow a CB
&gt; radio and let the truckers on the route know. I
&gt; think in such a case you
&gt; might find them very helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, I think I will probably do just that. . .
&gt; install a CB in my
&gt; bus.
