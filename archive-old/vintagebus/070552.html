Subject: RE: [VB] Bad Football?

To copy something for personal use... go for it!!!  

Sell it or use it in some *public* fashion for personal gain and
infringe.


Let's say you see some cool idea... like chroming all the bolts on a
vehicle.  You think 'hey, that's cool' and do it yourself.  I don't
think you're infringing.  Now lets say the person chroming the bolts got
some form of 'trademark' or some other *legal* protection on it.  If you
would do it and kept it at home to admire just for yourself, no harm
done... but take it out and display it or use your own chromed bolts for
personal gain and you're at fault.  

Now, that's legally... but on the moral/ethical side and if there were
no *legal* protection, if you were to say to people, 'hey, I got this
cool idea from so-and-so and liked it so much I did it also', I'd say
you can definitely lower your risk of mental turmoil.  Tell people it
was your own pipe dream and you're definitely at fault.

... its all about what you do with your 'copied' item.

Rex posed the thought:
Is it &quot;bad football&quot; to use an aftermarket custom part that someone 
else bought from a vendor and copy the design/work to fabricate 
something simular for yourself?

For example...dropped spindles...or straight axle kits...or front 
disc brake kits....or T4 upright fanshrouds...or safari windows...or 
whatever?

Is there anything &quot;wrong&quot; with doing this? Not legally...maybe just
ethically.
