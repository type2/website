I am in full support of the Orange County Chapter of NEATO. I am not into
slamming any particular individuals and would encourage others have some
class and restrain themselves. Dead silence can be a deafening sound. Most
everyone knows what the deal is by now. The point is that change was needed.
Change is good. OCTO is change. OCTO is good. 

OCTO is a real club with real activity. 

On that note I'd strongly encourage folks to attend the OCTO show on
Saturday, June 12, 1999, at 7:00 AM. Further details may be found via
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~vwclassic/octo.html or http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/shows/
or by calling Moe Moore at the Transporter Garden 714-848-5955 or Charlie
Hamill at the Bus Stop 714-892-5293.

That other show is slated to begin at 8:00 AM and run past the start of the
Ed Economy's Toy Show. Ed's Toy Show will be held once again at the Irvine
Holiday Inn from 12:00 noon until late afternoon. My guess is that it will
wind up about 4 or 5PM. See the VW Classic website for proper details.

So Nate, I'd suggest that you show up at the OCTO by 7:00 AM and if you get
bored within an hour then you can roll over to that other show when it
opens. You will no doubt be able to find parking.
