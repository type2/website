turns out the tranny is lower geared than I thought.  After another useful
trip in the truck to haul off scrap metal today, I went down to Eric andBarbs'
who kindly put a tach on the thing.  While admittedly I am not sure of exact
accuracy, and the fact that with a 6V system and a 12V tach complecated
things, reading about half we figured, which meshed with engine sounds, and
bumpy roads added to that, it turns out that 3000rpms in 4th is about a mere 

45mph.

Yes, it is buildt to be slow.   (maybe this is it's theme song)

Contrast this to the 58mph in 4th at 3000rpms in my 61 (using same
tach),(actual road speed being closer t o 62) and you see how wide a range
there is- and it can be even lower, or rarely even higher, than these figures.
With a low geared type 2 like my truck it is easy to get into higher revs and
thrash the motor.   So to those people who mistakenly  thought that cause my
61 was geared like it is that their's was too (NOT), it is safer to think it
is geared like my truck, or check it out for yourself.    I was surprised at
how many people wrote who thought that.     I thought truck was higher geared
than it is, but maybe it was just wishful thinking, not wanting to stick to
45.

Eric suggested I get a 3.88 trans and a1600 engine for it (to get another
20mph at the top side), but I am not sure that's where I'm going with it, and
in any case can't put the time/energy/money into it right now, and will just
continue to fix various neglected things and take care of delayed maintenance
on it and use it as a round town vehicle.  Think I'm done with the big hauling
junk away/yard clean up phase for a while anyhow.  At least the windsheilds
dont leak.

On a lighter note, the wiper motor that I cleaned out and regreased the other
day, but was still noisy, has quieted down after a short period of use.  It
was raining hard this am, and it seems it can take a little to get the
lubricant worked in- now the wiper system is very smooth and quiet and nice.
I recommend wiper motor attention to anyone with squeaks or noise or flops
there- especially as tis the season (here at least, and many other places too
i'm sure.)
