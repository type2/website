Today I set off sailing in the unfamiliar '63 on the freeways of Phoenix.
(Welcome to El Lay!) I was used to an hour of Howard Stern and A/C at 70
MPH. Today it was engine noise, hot wind, at 52-55. Geez, a 1600 DP oughta
go faster than that I thought. Yet, I had never really driven a small nut
tranny.

ya- the speed is related to gearing- you could get differnt speeds at the same
rpms w/ different trannies, or the same speed at the same rpms in the same bus
with different engines.   Maybe try bigger tires.     Maybe a gear oil change
would quiet things down?   How is your insulation to keep the noise out?   how
well tuned is the motor?   how about a radio?   wheels of different sizes? -
that sounds a little wonky.  So much to do, so little time, eh? 
 .. .  . .  .  .
Oh well~ the results is that another splittie is on the road and running in
fine fashion. Look for me in the white bus with green bumper &lt;ft only&gt;, red
driver's door that squeaks like a ship wreck, wheels of various sizes and
hues, and a fine Rex Eastman supplied 3/4 rack. =)
It really looks like Joseph's coat of many colors.
