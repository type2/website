Dave,

They are olive drab--dark green , right?

I am almost positive that the powdercoater's can match the color----

Bu think of this----
Powdercoating goes on pretty thick, and after you have it all looking
nice and pretty, how in the hell are you going to get the poles to go
together, with all that baked on powdercoating on the female, and male
ends of the poles?

It won't happen, and you'll wind up scratching the hell out of the
poles, and you'll wind up right back where you started.

Go to an automotive paint supply with pole in hand and have them match
the paint, and spray them.

It is one hell of allot less expensive and the results will be the same.

Your going to mess the poles up one way or another, in storage, or in
putting them together, so why waste the funds? 

Later,

            ______________
