Here is a cool tid bit for ya Robert...the rear cargo
areas on the early westys were painted by BRUSH not
sprayed!  Pull of your panels and you will see paint
brush strokes ending at the border of the tanish
paint.  And if you look VERY closely you may see
occasional brush strokes in the tan iteslf on areas
exposed.
  
My good friend Mike redid a `57 westy I sold him...had
the color matched off a piece of bus which never saw
daylight....he had it mixed in Centari Acrylic enamel
and actually had a flatner mixed in to give it that
satin look like the original had.  He applied it via
brush as did westfalia...and being Acrylic enamel the
stuff flowed out very smooth as it sat.  Looks
identical to the original.

If you wanna contact Mike about the paint codes ect
email him at &lt;tcs_at_glasscity_dot_net&gt;

&gt; Here's one for the minutia lords.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to me that the metal trim ring INSIDE the
&gt; speedometer and the metal trim ring INSIDE the
&gt; deluxe clocks are painted the same color.  Said
&gt; color also appears to be the same as the paint used
&gt; on the cargo/camper area on the SO-23 Westfalias. 
&gt; This is the green/gray color that is close to Mango
&gt; Green but not the same.  I've  discovered after
&gt; looking at my bus and also numerous other SO-23
&gt; campers (Todd S's to name one) that regardless of
&gt; the exterior colors, i.e. Sealing Wax Red/Beige Grey
&gt; or Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey, the rear camper
&gt; interior color is this greenish-grey color.
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short, I want to respray the trim rings
&gt; on my speedo and clock, and was curious if anyone
&gt; knew what this color is?  I'm also planning on
&gt; respraying the interior camper area of the bus, at
&gt; least around the window openings and rear hatch.  If
&gt; anyone doesn't know, then I'll be coming up with as
&gt; close a match as possible, in case anyone is
&gt; interested in the recipe.  My painter is a master
&gt; matcher so it shouldn't be too hard, but if someone
&gt; already has a color code it will save some time.
