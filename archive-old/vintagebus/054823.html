Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

Who cares about the &quot;value it will hold&quot;, invest in
the market if thats the case. If you like the bus, but
it and enjoy it.

&gt; I have a chance to pic up a 66 Sundial, and at risk

&gt; anyone give me the pros &amp; cons of a Sundial vs a
&gt; Westy. By that I mean is
&gt; the quality of the camp gear as good as a westy, do
&gt; they hold their value,
&gt; that sort of thing. I know some of them were built
&gt; on panel buses and this
&gt; one appears to be also, any pros or cons?
