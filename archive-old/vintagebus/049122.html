A few years back Michael Moore of &quot;Roger and Me&quot; film fame, www.michaelmoore_dot_com , gathered up a bunch of beater cars, equipped them with car alarms and parked them near the home of the president of the largest car alarm company. Tripped them all early on a weekend morning. The prez came out very upset, called the cops, etc. 

Our local cops make a lot of money billing business owners for false alarms. Wish they could do that for car alarms set too sensitive. 

Congrats to Ronnie on the new special body truck! Hope to see it at Jerome?
