Great weekend as expected!
I chose the trailer the '54 Barncamper over to the
shows as previously discussed. Friend's Jeep Cherokee
with tow pkg had problems all weekend long so I ended
up driving the '54 from 20 miles East of Banning to
the Coast. The Jeep got it's radiator sys fixed at
PepBoys all day Sat and enjoyed a &quot;redo&quot; at PepBoys on
Sunday. Friends missed most of both shows. 
After driving all Friday night we arrived at the OCTO
at 5AM Saturday. The '54 looked proud sitting next to
the other 34 barndoors. In my opinion it cetainly held
it's own in the lineup. I was amazed that there was no
early bus division at the Classic! Camper class got
buried in the back this year with all of the noses
hidden-arse ends out. Three years ago there were many
very bitchen campers and at least three nice
Dormobiles. Maybe I was just too busy to notice this
year. Maybe they don't exist anymore... To me the
nicest showings this year were Doug Denlinger's
beautiful early Hatch Westy and one of my annual
favorites~ dark blue SO42pop with the privy tent from
up in the Seattle area. Nice people...
Return trip was great until AZ border and friend's
Jeep tranny started spewing ATF. Off loaded the barney
one more time and drove home with the Jeep and trailer
in tow. The bus performed like a champ with no
problems. Apparently I could have done without the
trailer rental as the barn seems to be capable of
driving anywhere.

To my amazement, the bus is still available. I dont
get the logic of the bus scene anymore what-so-ever.
Crack is getting cheaper and cheaper. The concept of
individualistic thinking seems to have escaped the
buyers of the moment. Apparently everyone wants to be
a unique free-thinking individual *exactly* like the
next guy. Whatever, I can see that logic. I'd join in
lockstep with everyone else and trade for an
individualist's Tahoe 2500 about now. We must conform!
Naw, driving the barn at 2am across the desert looking
at the glow provided by the bad-assed old school Bosch
driving lamps and 6v headlights with the *barn*
safaris kicked while listening to the hum of the 36 is
too cool. =)
