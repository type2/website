Subject: Caring for a rubber mat
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello again,
I am writing regarding my front rubber matt on my '65 kombi. I am trying to find the right cleaners/chemicals for it to keep it from drying out and cracking. I have heard that armor-all is bad because it contains silicone, but I am not sure what doesn't contain silicone. Any suggestions appreciated.

I am also interested in stories regarding products to use oin the vinyl seats, as my rear seats have the original vinyl, which is generally in great shpae and I would like to keep it that way.

The previous owner recommended a product called &quot;323&quot; I think, but i have been unable to locate that.

thanks
Kevin Guarnotta
