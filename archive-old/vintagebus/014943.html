Hey man! the fnt bumper on the cover of July '55
Popular Mechanics looks chromed... WTF is Barry M.
Goldwater doing laying in the back? Are the three guys
on the cover straight or what?... What's the sleeping
arraingment? Gramps, Father and son? Camping/hunting
buddies? NEBLA members and a recruit? &lt;well never you
mind&gt;

&quot;Oldest Camper&quot; in the US huh?
Um, what month of '54? If we are talking barndoor era
buses that technically also happens to be currently in
a camper config then... (Heh-heh) Is it in perfect
running order? Is the paint beyond nice? Does it have
barn era safaris? brand new tires and tubes? correct
rear wheel wells? Steering box tighter than almost all
post 2/55 buses? vintage Bosch driving lights? a floor
safe? bitchen tow hitch? handcrank? semaphores and
tons of spare barn parts? When was the last time that
it was driven to the OCTO/Classic and back? 
Naw, On second thought I'll stay out of this one. ;-)
