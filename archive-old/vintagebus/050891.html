Subject: re:Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

was writ
&quot;As to what wieght oil you should be using depends on how cold the weather
is
i your area.  We use 30 Wt Castrol oil and only rarely does it get below 20F
here.  It has gotten as low as -6F, but that was freakish.&quot;

If i remeber correctly Castrol straight 30, which iused to use down
south(houston, tx)say on the bottle not to use below 40 degrees. therefore I
switched to 10w-30 up here in boston.
