Subject: Shift rod coupler off! Hurray! Shiftrod staying put - boo,
  hssss

Hi,

Many thanks to the list for advice on the shift rod coupler. It is now 
out of the way.

However, the front shift rod is not budging loose from the rear shift 
rod.

Thanks to Dave Easterwood - who so graciously traded his Bentley repro 
for my OG vol. 2 - I am now looking at the workshop manual on the topic. 
And well, it is just as lame as my Clymer in this regard (all other 
subject matter rocks though).

So, here I am again asking for advice.

Do I have to do more drilling to take the set screw out? Is the front 
shift rod a hollow tube, and the middle shift rod slide into the middle? 
I have been spraying this area with lubricant, PBBlaster, Liquid Wrench, 
etc. I tried the method of trying to twist the front shift rod free 
while holding the other rod with a wrench, but that isn't getting me 
very far.

Thanks again in advance for your suggestions.

Thanks,
Conrad
