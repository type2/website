 John had writ:

I don't know if the alloys are all that different.  One thing about HO cases

is that if they've been used in a bus all their life they are probably

getting pretty used up.  If a case hasn't been abused it can be ok no matter

what kind.

okay-   if you have a pile of cases, and have them checked for cracks and
warpage and studs pulling out, you are going to get a lot more problems with
the early alloy cases than the late.   If it hasn't been abused- great, you
are happy.   But IF it has, the later alloys hold up better.      I haven't
had a stud pull out of an A case.  Have on H cases.   What this means is that
the A cases give a bit more leeway just in case.     I have happily driven in
H cases for years and many miles, but I was careful and treated it well.   I
don't think it's the age either, cases get switched around bug to bus to
garage to bug to junkyard to bus and who know how may miles.  Sometimes they
sit a long time, or driven infrequently or driven a lot, hard.    If the  PO
was a DPO, the case may be funky if it's a H case, but not likey if it's an A
case.

my couple cents of ramblings that is.  In any case, the case should be checked
if you are doing a complete rebuild.

The A cases are two different alloys.  The AS-41 was used up until the fuel

injected beetles came out so in 75 I think they went to the AS-21 (AK?)

cases.  These are supposed to be alot stronger than the earlier AE cases

made out of AS-41.  If you get ahold of an AS21 case in good condition that

would make a great bus engine IMHO.  When they went to 8mm studs they went

to case savers I think?  If you have an H case that is good, go ahead and

use it.  Only H case I ever had had cracks in the bearing webs so you can

figure it saw some abuse.  The nice thing about VWs is you can keep

recycling things a long time until they are really used up, so I'd say never

throw away a case if it's good, whatever the designation.

-&gt;and.............

&gt;someone said that H cases suck.   No they dont suck.   They are great when

&gt;used, but they do not stand abuse as much as the later alloy used in the A

&gt;cases.  B cases are H cases with the bigger oil passages, BTW.   If you

&gt;overheat you H case the studs may pull out.   They don't if you don't.

(Or

&gt;the DPO).  Yes, an  A case is sturdier.  But Not all have factory installed

&gt;case savers, either, just certain ones (is it the AKs).    Yes, I would

prefer

&gt;an A  case, and that what I have in my 61.       I have driven many a mile

in

&gt;a H case, and proud.
