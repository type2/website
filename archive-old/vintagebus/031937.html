If I had a money tree in the back yard I'd use a new case for every engine I
built, but I don't, so I get 'em line bored.

If you get your case bored by a careful machinist there isn't any reason for
it to be any worse than it was when it was new. I would be a lot more concerned
about the weights of the rods and pistons that this &quot;kid&quot; stuck in the engine.
I'll bet he didn't check a thing. In any case, since it's all put together,
I would just use it and see how long it lasts.

The oil filter is a good idea.

Robin Hood was Da Man! 8^)

&gt;Calling all engine nuts (and builders, too...)
&gt;
&gt;So there I am reading my Gene Berg stuff, and there it is again!  A lengthy

&gt;paragraph explaining why they don't use or recommend a line bored case, and

&gt;the problems that afflict about 80% of them....early warpage, low oil
&gt;pressure, overheating, etc....
&gt;
&gt;I have an engine that I bought with a '67.  This was the first bus I bought

&gt;last year.  Came with a Long Enterprises tranny and RGB's....and the kid I

&gt;bought it all from had built and installed a 1600 single-port with all new

&gt;(or rebuilt) parts.  Starting with a line bored case.  How should I think
&gt;about this?
&gt;
&gt;The only excuse I have for paying what I did for that bus is it's new engine

&gt;and tranny!
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts?  I guess I will be rushing out to full-flow filter the case,

&gt;and mebbe get a big oil pump....
