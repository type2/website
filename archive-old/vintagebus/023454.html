I assume an old trick, but Steven Howell showed me how to use the OLD race
to pound in the new one.  As long as you don't put it too far in (where you
can't get it out), worked great.

i apologise for the error...yes the races not the actual bearing, and no you

do not NEED to, unless you cant do it correctly.  the tool you mention is 
excellent.

have fun
