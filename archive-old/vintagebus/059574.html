Thought I would give everyone a quick update on paintscratch_dot_com. As a =
backgrounder I ordered two touchup paint bottles from them for my Sealing =
wax Red/ Beige Grey Bus. I am very happy with the results of the paint =
they mixed me as it is bang on in accuracy. Unfortunately it is rare that =
most busses in original paint have not faded somewhat so you may find that =
the touch up paint is not a perfect match to your faded paint. However I =
compared a drop of the touch up paint to some original unfaded sealing wax =
red and very very good match.

On the downside the touchup paint ain't cheap. It cost me $25.00 US for =
two touch up bottles and shipping to Canada. Initially they were telling =
me that they could not send the paint via post office and wanted to send =
UP$, however they ended up sending it via the post office for a whopping =
$1.03 in shipping.

I would recommend having a look at their site as they stock many common =
pre 68 bus colour paints.
