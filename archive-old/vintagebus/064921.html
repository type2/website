Subject: Re: [VB] valve clearance

The original specs were .004 for intake and .006 for exhaust (because the
stem grows). It has been generally accepted for the last 25 years to do
.006
on both intake and exhaust, thus you only have to have one feeler gauge.
------------------------ Clip ----------------------------
My old 66 has a 72 1600 DP with a hot cam and I found notes on the
underside of the engine door that tell me .006 intake and .008 exhaust.
I tried the .006 all the way and it just had a dead spot.
Still runs quiet with these settings.
You might want to look for notes in the back of manuals etc.
I keep notebooks with all my cars and log repairs, specs etc.
Keeps me from forgetting and someday they'll all have confused new
owners.
