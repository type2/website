Subject: RE: [VB] Wasserboxer conversion versus aftermarket type 1
  aluminum case versus t

George writ:
&gt;The one critical mod seems to be the narrowing of the cylinder studs.  I
wonder if it would be feasable to alter the holes in the heads rather than
machining and installing the offset inserts required to narrow the
spacing.  the cylinders wouldn't care if the spacing was a bit large than
normal.

Of course, one might question the desire to build an wasserboxer-case type
1 when the type 4 engine is available in similar stock displacements.
&lt;

I have tried to figure how to bore the heads to fit the larger T5 studs and 
I just do not see a feasable way to do it.  It is possible but cheaper and 
cleaner to just get the stud holes in the case machined out for like $200 
(fair deal for the work in my opinion).  The only option might be to get 
some Super Elliminator heads from CB and then bore your own stud holes, but 
that is not really for a street machine bus.

Lets compare the T1, T4 and T5.  T4 requires what I consider a substantial 
amount of work and money to get into an upright configuration.  The only 
catch to that might be the Cali &quot;NextGen&quot; conversion which is more of a DIY 
thing, but requires you to have a lot of fabrication equipment on hand or 
you end up paying someone else to make some of the stuff.  The 911 T4 or DTM 
(now RIP) or SharpBuilt are nice but expensive so factor that into the 
conversion cost.  I actually have a DTM kit that arrived yesterday for a 
buddy's engine build, and it is nice but not to the design quality of the 
original VW upright tinware configuration.  So basically the way I see it 
the upright shrouds are even a compromise.  The T4 motor for a rebuild done 
RIGHT is not cheap, one word: heads.  As we all know a non-stroker (69mm 
crank, 1776 or 1914 - bus moderate spec not a dragger) T1 will beat almost 
any T4 stock rebuild in price. Now enters the T5.  The T5 is very similar to 
a T1 in setup and parts so most things are a push as far as costs go.  The 
real difference between a T1 and T5 is the stroker question.  If you just 
want a 69mm crank stick with the T1, but if you intend to stroke it out the 
T5 is a cheaper solution (depending if you get raped on a core 2.1 WBX, but 
estimate 100-250 is fair).  Also with the T5 76.4mm crank it is factory 
grade stuff, so quality is really good.

Lets breakdown a T5 versus a stroker T1.

T5 costs (stock redline 5500RPM):
76.4mm crank - free
T4 210 or 215 flywheel - $65ish
94B P&amp;Cs machined for T5 bores, but cut to your spec so no shims - $150
Change stud pattern - $200
T1 rebuilt rods stock - $34 (RIMCO) + balance $15?
T4 lifters (hydro or solid) - $75 (aircooled_dot_net)
Main Bearings Kobleschmidt German 2.1 std/std/std - $82 (yes you can get 
them in the USA if you look hard enough)

T1 stroker:
76.4mm crank - $285 (DMS - but the listed price is low since the webpage is 
old, I think they are like $350 now. +40 core. And shipping!)
T1 flywheel reconditioned and balanced - $65 (DMS)
Cut case for 94s - $45 (DMS)
Clearance Case for stroker - $45 (RIMCO)
Clearanced and balance rods - $95 (DMS)
T1 lifters Mahle Brazil - $45ish (Lots of performance options though)
T1 main bearings KS - $45ish


The one thing I am not factoring here is that if you want hydro lifters the 
T1 case needs machined for this where a T5 case is ready to go with them 
(same as the T4 lifters).  So if you want hydro the T5 is more attactive.  
Also the T1 cam and T4 hydro lifters work way way better than the poor T4 
cam layout, why I do not know but T4s are notorious for poor hydro 
performance.

Also the T5 AL case is in the same line as the T4 for allign boring.  Most 
of the T5s I have seen or heard about do not need a bore at all... In fact 
they run so nicely that most of the main bearings could be reused!  (do not 
laugh as many people have done this as standard practice in a rebuild as the 
bearings are still in spec)

Lets just add that the T5 uses all the T1 tin with minimal trimming to fit 
(as the T5 case is wider).  And some provisions for the doghouse oil cooler 
to be mounted in a full fow fashion, still trying to figure the best way 
here.

Anyway the way I see it the T5 blows away a T4 conversion or the new nasty 
aftermarket AL T1 cases (I have yet to hear of a good one that has not 
needed additional machine work to be right).  Again the only thing that 
would beat it is if you choose to stay with a 69mm stroke where a magnesium 
case is used (1600,1776,1914).

That's all I can ramble for one day :)

Take Care,
Adrian
