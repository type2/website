Chris wrot:

Clara, I salute you.
I am now on my 58th VW.
I NEVER drive on freeway.
I trailer them to shows.
I will sometimes drive three or four blocks before getting
back in the garage.
Folks actually drive their VWs?
- - - - -  -

yes,   they are vehices.  I drive an old VW.    my 69 bug is late model.
Actually, it seems that quite a lot of people on this list drive their old
buses, round about, go camping, etc.  It's FUN.   You should try it.
.........
Maybe I live in the wrong place.
Go to work, 18 miles freeway, go 75 to 80 mph or get run over.
VW won't do this:(
Weekends, Tijuana, Bad roads, playing bumper cars. to change lanes
you must push car in lane you selected out of the way.
VW won't do this:(
-  -- - - -
I have developed an assertive driving style for urban areas.    I keep well
aware of lanes, the space my bus occupies, the space others occupy, reletive
speeds, and where I am going.    I have a loud horn and use it.  I change
lanes with decision.   I like splitties for bad roads, have gone where the
4WDs fear to go!   (unless you lowered the bus, in which case the back roads
aren't so fun for you)  No, I do not drive 75/80, and I may be slow, but as
she said, I am ahead of you.
.........
Come back to Sandy Eggo, wait at border, up to 2 hours idling.
VW won't do this:(
- - - -  -
there is no reasn why you shouldn't be able to idle while waiting.
.........
I love VWs!!!  I want to go 75 mph, NEVER, EVER run hot...
Idle for hours and not run hot.  This is what I want.
- - - - -
well, you have a point that they are not designed to do that.  It is a mental
thing, I don't need to do that.  I drive according to other rules, including
the limitations of the old bus.
.........
My bus goes 8 blocks before vapor locking and I must wait
for her to cool down for an hour to go another 8 blocks.
I love the thing.  It just isn't drivable.
- -  -- - -
there is something wrong with your bus.
. . . .  .. . . .  . .
I have it to wash and polish.  I also enjoy looking for all
the 15 window Deluxe parts that are missing.
Someday I will have a complete 1962 15 window Deluxe to look at.
But, to actually drive it somewhere?  No way.
It will get stolen, vandalized, scratched, dented, broken into,
If someone was to break one of my corner windows I would go bankrupt.
I love my bus.
-         - - - - -  - -
well, if you want a toy, that is fine.

For those who didn't see my ratty 61 M 130 deluxe at Kelley park, it has 3
bad dents (nose crease at bumper overrider line, left dogleg, and behind
cargo doors was bondoed 25 ? years ago) , original paint (faded) rocker rot
etc.   But I don't want it stolen, or vandalised, it locks well, but  one of
the corner windows is cracked (pitted road in Montana to glacial lake)     If
it was shiny like my 65 I would think twice before bush whacking, but if you
want to drive it.    Thom took a picture of me and Duncan in front of my 61
bus, it may be on a webpage.

fix your vapor lock
get it appraised (written) and insure it just in case
drive it.
get an alarm if that makes you feel better.

what happened to SWU:N ?

the Split Window Utility Network.    yes they are driven.
