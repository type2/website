Hi J,
Chroming any used part is expensive due to the hand work involved.   First 
the part has to be straightened and polished to remove as much pits  and dings.  
Then plated with copper and that polished.  Then a nickel  plating layer that 
is polished.  Lastly a layer of chrome, which is  polished.  Any chrome work 
that does not have all three layers of plating  will not last long.
  That is why chrome flash plating, zinc plating and hot dip  galvanizing are 
so cheap, due to practically no hand work.
