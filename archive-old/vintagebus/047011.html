Hello, today i was going with my father to try and find a bus we saw a

couple months ago.  well that didn't work out but on the way back we did

find what appears to be a 50's or 60's singlecab.  it has the small rear

windshield and outward facing fresh air intakes so i figured it was an early

60's model. i had no luck locating the paint plat, can someone tell me where

they are are on single cabs. any help is appreciated.

thank you, Bryan Dean

on trucks the rear window and vents switched in 66, the M code plate is behind
the passenger seat.    If there is no plate there, look in the engine
compartment on the right hand side.        if it has cone front turn signals
it is 61 or earlier, fried eggs 62 or later.    Gas guages appeared in 62.
1/3 2/3 front seats appeared july 62 (just before the end of the 62 model
year.     63  was the first year belley doors both sides was standard, before
that it was an option.
