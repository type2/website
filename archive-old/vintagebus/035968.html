To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Dave Palmer and Creative Engineering are now making reproduction Bumper 
Mouldings, Vent trim, Beltline Mouldings and tons of other new stuff!! They 
also are going to have some nice sheetmetal too!  I am in no way affiliated 
with CE but am a very satisfied customer.
