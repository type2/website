My '62 15-window (which I never talked about) left today to a new home in=

Tucson.  The new owner seems serious about returning it to stock conditio=
n
fairly quickly so maybe she will send me pictures soon.

I started laughing when she said she had second thoughts about whether a
walk-thru was what she wanted.  &quot;The spare tire is so ugly back there in
the back, I hate the way it blocks the windows.&quot;  Hahahahaha

Hopefully she didn't wreck it on the way home, one of the front wheel cyl=
inders
was leaking a tiny bit...
