Subject: Re: [VB] Phat Boy from Aircooled_dot_net!

Hi Dave,

Since you are running a T4 upright conversion the setup I have will not work 
for you at all.

The Phat Boys I have seen on T4 uprights have all been home made custom kind 
of things, but very doable with a MIG welder.  Granted they were in sedans 
and not a bus...

The T4 is just crippled by poor available exhaust systems until you pay some 
real $$$ to get a nice one that is more of a full merged kind of thing.

As for pictures I can work on that in a few days and maybe swindle some 
webspace from Rex for everyone to see :)

Take Care,
Adrian

&gt;            Let's see some pictures.  I want to use a Muffler of that style
&gt;on my T4 conversion.  I hate the ay this Bugpack Muffler sounds.
&gt;
&gt;Yes folks the T4 started.
