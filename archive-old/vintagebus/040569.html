Anyone see the &quot;NOS&quot; 28 PICT carb currently at $250.  My question:
why is the &quot;VW&quot; logo on the side machined off?  My first hunch is that
this is a send-back.

Did I ever tell you abou the Porsche swap I went to, where this one
seller had a whole pile of 912 cases, each with the cooler mount
broken off.  $100-$200, depending on how greasy it was.  &quot;Need slight
repair&quot; the sign said.  I heard him tell one potential buyer that
that was a common weak spot on 912 cases.
