Thom,

You have given some great advise here, the problem is, people are what they 
are.  There are &quot;infamous bus traders&quot; out there who rattle can a whole bus 
just to get a few more bucks out of it.  I know of one such individual who 
has even been given an AWARD for this!!!!!  During a period of time when I 
still had some faith in this individual, he and I made a trade:  I gave him 
some stuff on the spot, and he would give me an &quot;NOS&quot; 1600 case.  What I 
finally wound up with was a worn and BEAD BLASTED case.  I only bring all of 
this up because your examples are so close to what I have experienced.  The 
real kicker to my story is that this is an individual that I and my family 
had befriended.  We had taken him into our home, shared food and money with 
him.  My wife even tried to hook him up with a girl friend of hers (with 
both's concent).  My (somewhat morbid) point is that in this world it is 
&quot;buyer be ware&quot;.  You just can't trust anyone anymore.  I can't echo your 
advise to potential buyers enough.  Yor comments to sellers, otoh, I am 
affraid are wasted.  People are what they are.

Sorry to sound so depressing,
