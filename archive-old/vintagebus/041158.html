I have sent 4 cars/buses to and from the LA area to Chicago area for $700 to
$800
each way.However all have been shipped in an exposed truck.I used A
AAAdvantage Auto Transport
(dba.  AAA Driveway &amp; Truck Transport) out
of Tempe Az.the last time.Sorry I don't have there #.
Good Luck,
                woody

&gt; Now Woody should be up to date on this subject but last I checked it was
&gt; like around $650.00. Get on the horn with all the moving companies in the
&gt; Yellow Pages. I would also check with some big carriers as sometimes they
&gt; have their semis going back to  Chicago half loaded. I might ask a few
guys
&gt; I know. Care to know what they have to say?

&gt; &gt; Someone just asked me for a recommendation on shipping a VW from
&gt; &gt; San Diego to Chicago. He has checked out a couple of transport firms and
&gt; &gt; they want around $1100.00. Enclosed and insured.
&gt; &gt; Has anyone on the list had experience with this....He and I would
&gt; appreciate
&gt; &gt; some words of wisdom on getting this done without unnecessary headaches.
I
&gt; &gt; think $1100.00 is more than he can afford.
&gt; &gt; thanks
