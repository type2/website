noticed a slight fuel leak coming from the throttle linkage is there 
something i did wrong? is thee a way to fix this?? &gt;&gt;

Hi Nick,
This could be caused by several things.  
1.  Loose carb reseviour shut off valve.
2.  Missing gasket between the reseviour shut off valve and the top of the 
carb body.
3.  Reseviour float is cracked or too heavy.
4.  Fuel pump rod is too long.
5.  Freak fuel pump just puts out too much fuel pressure even with proper rod 
length.
6.  If you are running an electric fuel pump you need a regulator to get the 
pressure down to 3-5 Lbs. per sq. inch. pressure depending on wether one is 
running a carb or carbs.
Hope this helps,  Eric&amp;Barb
