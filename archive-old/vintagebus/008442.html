I took some pictures of these 2 buses in the mid '80s plus a pile more of
the old yard when the '48 Beetle was there...Also used to be a '50 panel as
well. Is Mr. Chipps still alive?

&gt; Some of you may have seen this picture before,, but I thought it was worth
&gt; looking at again, with the interest in Barn Doors
&gt; I wish I had taken an interest to that Bus, when I had the chance to get
it!

know
