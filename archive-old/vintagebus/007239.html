You know, I was thinking that it looked about the size of a dime.  I've got
tape over it right now, been there for 2 days as I haven't had time to do
anything due to long hours.  I'll have some time tomorrow to try a few fix
trix

&gt; This is kind of embarassing to admit but I had one of those plugs blow out
&gt; on my 74 Thing. I used a dime and some JB weld. I drove it that way for a
&gt; year before I sold the car. No cracks or anything, it held up perfect.
&gt; Hope this helps and if you find a 30/31 in a pile with a dime it may be
mine.
