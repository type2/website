Subject: Re: [VB] Ordering from Bus Depot??

I've had mixed results Last time I ordered from bus depot, I got two of
three items much faster than anticipated, the last item, my reason for
placing an order never came. I didnt find out untill I had called twice that
it never would. And the guy I spoke with insisted I had been called. funny,
I never talked to anyone, and I never got a message on my machine either.
not even an apology from the guy I was talking to. very disappointing
service. the time before that I got every thing in one shot and within the
specified time frame.

&gt; You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
&gt; take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17 Sept
01
&gt; and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to get
the
&gt; magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed in 2
&gt; weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came in.
&gt; Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the wait.
A
&gt; month to a month and a half would have been understandable.
&gt;
