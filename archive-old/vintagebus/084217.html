Subject: Re: [VB] sump stud repair redux...

How about getting a tap and die set to finish up the threads on the stud 
you just got. I don't know if you have a harbor freight near you, but 
they have a metric tap and die set for cheap. It wont last long but 
should handle what you need to do.

...or, 6mm all-thread anybody?

got my 6x31mm studs from a/c_dot_net today; sadly, thay all have either the 
little 'ball' in the middle, or a threadless space there.  so they won't 
work to repair my loose sump plate stud. what i want to do is put a 
doubled nut INSIDE the case, so i need a longer-than-stock stud i can 
screw straight THROUGH the case from the inside.

so i guess i need to find either 6mm all-thread, or a longish 6mm bolt 
that i can cut the head off of.

just a heads-up for those thinking along my original lines... eric sez 
all studs longer than stock will have the interruption in the middle.  
wish their web page said that!
