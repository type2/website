More then likely you can't shim it...the end play is
set to give play between the flywheel and number 1
thrust main bearing...the extra wear-slop play folks
usually see is that number 1 main bearing loose in the
case....thus any extra shimming cannot properly
correct this.  The case needs to be machined foe
oversize thrust at number 1 main bearing...

&gt; Hellllo,
&gt; I'm having a difficult time deciding what to do
&gt; here.  I built up my 
&gt; engine and its *almost* done (top end rebuild
&gt; basically) and I just need 
&gt; to slap on the carbs and the breast tin.  I went out
&gt; today and bought a 
&gt; dial indicator to check my end play and am unsure of
&gt; the results.  This 
&gt; engine was rebuilt about 50,000 miles ago (I have
&gt; receipts to verify 
&gt; thanks to the PO's!) and as some of you may remember
&gt; i got a washer in 
&gt; the #1 cylinder back in the fall and just decided to
&gt; do a top end 
&gt; rebuild on the beast.  Well I checked the end play
&gt; and the dial 
&gt; indicator tells me that I have between .007&quot; and
&gt; .008&quot; of play.  Bentley 
&gt; says that it should be within 003&quot; and .005&quot; with a
&gt; wear limit of 
&gt; .006&quot;.  What should I do?  Should I tear the beast
&gt; back down again and 
&gt; get the shortblock rebuilt or should I just shim it?
&gt;  If I were to shim 
&gt; it how long may I expect it to last?  I realize its
&gt; just a band aid, but 
&gt; I want to drive my bus, but yet I don't want the
&gt; thought of that looming 
&gt; over my head, unless it really isn't that bad.  The
&gt; engine ran wonderful 
&gt; before I took it out, but I got that washer in the
&gt; #1 cyl some how when 
&gt; I was replacing PR tube seals just after I got back
&gt; from BNNTA last fall 
&gt; and I thought I would just &quot;freshen&quot; it up.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, what to do what to do?
&gt; Opinions anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Isaiah
