&gt;  Does the sundial (I dont know, Im a westy guy) have a roof rack? Can you 
get 
&gt; 
&gt;  one?
&gt;  
&gt;  I would get some way of securring things up top. Then add these things;
&gt;  
&gt;  Clutch plate, tranny oil, coil, jack, a piece of plywood, brakes, brake 
&gt;  fluid, slave brake cylinder, and a spare master, and heres the kicker: 3 
&gt;  spare tires, a small air pump, and fix a flat.
&gt;  From what I understand some of the roads are real nightmares on tires. Be 
&gt;  prepared. Get an alignment before going.
&gt;  
hm-  I keep the jack under the z bed.  I I strapped it to the roof rack it 
would be more work/hassle to get it under the bus where it can be used. 

 Packing stuff  for convienience is important- I leave the tool box where it 
will be handy.  Sometimes some screwdrivers/wrenches live on the dash tray.  
Keep you spare oil behind the drivers seat, or across from the battery.    
Like others have said, no one ran out and bought all this stuff- but road 
tripping VW drivers have learned what may break - and through an extra in, 
after it broke and we didn't have it. and it may sound like loads of stuff 
but it does not take that much space.   the longer you drive a split- the 
more pieces you carry.  those bits just live in the bus, with the spare 
clothes and stuff.   Jumper cables behind the passenger seat, useful for 
helping others too.  Someone mentioned oil pressure sender- definately. I 
have a selection of fuses and electrical repar bits and test light too.  I 
make a test light using a dash bulb, like muir says.  Have fun on the trip.
