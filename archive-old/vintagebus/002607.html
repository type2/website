Subject: Update on the tranny filler plug.

Just as I was about to head out and top the trans with fluid, Jon Furst 's
post on the vintagebus list came through.  He suggested that I run the tube
deeper into the fill plug so as not to have fluid running down the plug and
giving me a false reading by seeping out of the weep holes.  Good point so I
did it.

Instead of weep holes, I took a file and filed a nice big square notch in
the threads right alongside the plug.  You don't have to screw the plug all
the way in - just enough to do the job.  And sure enough, as the trans got
full, fluid came out of the notch.  I unscrewed it, doubted my work, put it
back in and pumped to more glugs (TM) worth of fluid into the trans.
Unscrewed the dripping plug and 2 glugs spilled on the driveway.  Damn.

So it works.  Not bad for a suppertime idea.
