Subject: Re:lockplates for RGB bolts

the earlier splits had the lock plates, the later ones split washers. change 
about 63 or 64? not sure when.    you might see what the online  parts lists 
says, or maybe they NLA'ed the lock plates.  

 think all had a lock plate around one bolt, bent, for the brake pipe to go 
through (with rubber grommet, though a piece of old fuel line works fine)  No 
ideas for sources, though I might have a few old ones.

&lt;&lt;  have a question though. When I took out my trans, the bolts that held the
 RGB's on did not have any lock washers or lock plates. I had a bus a long
 time ago and it had lock plates that the bolts went through and the corners
 of the lock plates bent up at the corners flush at one side of 3 of the RGB
 bolts on each side. The bent corner locked the bolt in place so it would not
 back out. Does anyone have these on their bus? I haven't been able to find
 them in any of the usual places. &gt;&gt;
