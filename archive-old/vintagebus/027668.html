Hi everybody,
This is Diana from Vancouver BC, I'm currently in Tennessee, back where I got
my bus from originally. 
We're getting close to 4000 miles right now, headed on to Georgia, then New
Orleans, then Las Vegas, then home.

Bus has been running not too badly since my recent rebuild, but I do notice
recently a bit of sluggishness and the gas mileage is dropping, from 25-27 mpg
at the beginning of the trip to about 21-23 mpg now.  This is especially strange
since we're not in the mountains like we were for the first week.  I notice
I'm smelling gas a lot but can't find a leak anywhere.  Oil temperature has
been pretty high the whole trip, up around 260 - 280.  On sunny days I have
to keep it at 50 mph or less or the temperature goes over 280 and I'm trying
to avoid that.  

It's been pouring rain the past few days so I haven't managed to do anything
to check for problems but I plan to do another tune-up soon (did one in Colorado)
so maybe that will shed some light on the subject.

Any advice welcome, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to check my email again.


TIA,
Diana
