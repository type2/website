&lt;&lt; I got it to move away from the backing
 plate about 1mm, just enough for the gasket to disintegrate and fall out in
 pieces. &gt;&gt;

The seal is hanging up on the spacer, which sometimes sticks to the 
stub-axle.  If you pry off the cover, the seal will stay on the flanged 
spacer.  Destroy the seal to remove it, and then heat or otherwise pull off 
the spacer/seal surface piece.  Then you can remove the backing plate.
