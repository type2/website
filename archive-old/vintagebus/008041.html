&gt;     My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too
&gt; bad(needs the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot),
&gt; but after I finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are
shot.
&gt; I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't
&gt; think I need to explain what I am getting at.

Walt, for a good look at what you've got in store for you, check out Kelly
Brown's (aka MetalWizard) site at www.metwiz_dot_com
He's currently showing pics of a 56 and a 55 undergoing some frame rail
restoration.
There is no &quot;pan&quot; per se on a bus that's equivalent to the pan on a type 1.
It would make things a lot more simple if there was.

As for your &quot;Samba&quot; question....a &quot;samba&quot; is anything someone who has a bus
on ebay wants it to be apparently...it has to have a hole in the roof, those
funny little windows that kids like to stand up to look out of, and it has
to cost $25K and up, oh, you have to continually refer to the bus and any
part of it as &quot;rare&quot; &quot;hard to find&quot; or &quot;desirable&quot;. One more thing, you
can't camp in it. Future bus historians will refer to it as an
overly-adorned parade wagon popular with Orthodontists daughters. It will
have a footnote in history unlike the volumes of praise lavished on the
functional and wonderful Westy. ;-)
