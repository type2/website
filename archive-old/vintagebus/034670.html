Hi Volks,
Forgot to mention to have the shop or the driver if see is up to it to check 
the battery cables.  If there is any doubt of thier condition or have those 
stupid repair battery clamps clamped on the cable just have them replaced.  
90% of the generation electrical problems we have encounted have either been 
due to bad cables or dirty connections at either end of these cables.
