George,

The best battery you can buy is an Optima. They're a little hard to find,
but offer more cranking amps and are especially good for cars that aren't
driven much. Sulfation which shortens the life of lead-acid batteries is
drastically reduced. Certainly not cheap - around $100, but I consider mine
to be a great investment. It has a carrying strap that makes it easy to
move from car to car. Optima probably has a website that will help you find
a dealer. They are available in 6v and 12v.

Regards,
Kris Trexler
