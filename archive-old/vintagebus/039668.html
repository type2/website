Sorry to keep posting the parts I need to the list, guys...but I live in 
Iowa, and swap meets are hard to find around these parts.  ;)
I'm looking for the front door striker plates.  I have both of mine, but the 
rubber is starting the go down the drain.  You guys know anything about 
replacing it?
Also need a striker plate for the rear hatch and a striker for the engine 
comp. lid.  Where have all mine gone?
