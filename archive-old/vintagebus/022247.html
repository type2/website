On my tech pages I have some dimensional stuff which would help in making
something of your own.  I have some Foreign Car Guide mags that came DIY
camper stuff, but I don't remember seeing any outright plans.  You're
welcome to swing by some time and paw thru them.

&gt;could put in on special occasions.
