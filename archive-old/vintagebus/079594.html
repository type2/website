Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Randar wheels???

Duly noted on the number of maunfacturers.  But seeing we are still at 2 companies, one at $1000 and the other at $1600-1800 at today's rate, add into the mix a very popular wheel---that's gonna equal a good grip of cash for the wheels.  The prices won't drop signifcantly until there are more repoppers (competition), less popularity of the wheel, or one of these companies begins to mass produce these wheels in mega quantities.

I'll admit, the JGE wheels do look good.  

Just as a sidebar, correct me if wrong, but wasn't Randy's intention to copy the Sears style Radar wheel and not the Empi?  I thought there was something I read about diffs in the centercaps and the ridge in the spokes of the wheel??

&gt; This isn't true, JGE out of the UK is also reproing (in my opinion) a 
&gt; better, more correct EMPI style Rader wheel. They debuted at the Classic 
&gt; last year, and with the exception of the gold set, I  believe they sold 
&gt; out..
