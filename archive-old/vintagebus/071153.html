thang?


&gt;..... So, what do you get for a 44 year old double cab for it's
birthday?
 I thought I would have Eric (my painter
&gt; friend) paint some flames on the narrowed spring plates for the double
&gt; cab. dove blue flames of course on the black plate, maybe a little bit
&gt; of pearl but I'll leave that up to Eric that likes to do flames.
&gt; . Flame suit on :-).......
