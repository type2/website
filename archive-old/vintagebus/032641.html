can you see brake fluid leaking from anywhere? (master cylinder would be my
first place to look) 
how far out are your brake shoe adjusters/ how wasted are your drums/shoes?
did a wheel cylinder pop/go out too far then reseat?
doesn't really sound like a bleeding will help, sounds more serious.
what kind of system/vehicle do you have (single circuit, dual circuit,
vacuum assist)? 
more details will help determine what may be going on.

&gt; Well I about rear ended 10+ cars yesterday.  My brakes went out in the 
&gt; morning came back that afternoon and then were completely gone today. 
Gonna 
&gt; attempt to bleed the system tonight, but what gives.  They were working 
&gt; great the other day.
