 NQ, drive it and enjoy it as is. There has to be thousands of duel spring
heads on the road now and you don't here about a giant recall, run them. As
for the oil leak, if vw's didn't leak how would you know when you were out
of oil or not. If it ain't leaking, you're out of oil and add some, if it's
leaking you still got some.. Drive it and enjoy.

Hope to see all in Jerome, stop by &quot;Campo de Havasu&quot; Fri night for tacos .
