Hi everyone! I just picked up a pretty basic, complete and original red 62 
Kombi for 400 bucks and plan on restoring it and had some questions. The body 
is pretty decent, no bondo or freaky hippy craftsmanship hackjobs. I noticed 
some pretty serious rust on the lower cargo doors both inside and out. Which 
other year doors are compatible with my Bus? I know where I can get a pair of 
67 doors but they dont look like the exact same as mine. I noticed it hasnt 
really got a headliner, just some grayish panels in the cab, is this 
original. it looks to be. It also needs brakes all around, I noticed some of 
the prices for these parts are pretty high. Is it possible to use 64-70 
cylinders and shoes without alot of modification or destroying the backing 
plates at all? I want to restore this wonderful Bus so that I can drive it 
next year and get rid of my New Beetle (bleh) and get back to my vintage Vws. 
I've also got a 56 Sunroof beetle I restored and I'm currently restoring the 
crappiest 58 Karmann Ghia on the planet as well, so I'm used to the old 
stuff. I also fix VWs daily, mostly bland late models though. I just never do 
Bus things. Lastly, can anyone recommend a good manual for restoring a Split 
Bus? Is there one that gives details of body construction and bodywork? I've 
got most all the Ghia and Beetle books now I need Bus ones. Thanks for 
listening to my idiotic babbling! I look forward to hearing from you all!
