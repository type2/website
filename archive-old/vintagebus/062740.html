Subject: Re: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case


The only problem with rubber hose is there will be friction and may hang up. 
Trucks use  plastic airline called synflex which will last longer than a 
rubber hose and alot less friction. It comes in diameters from 1/8&quot;i.d. to 
3/4&quot; i.d. You can get it at any truck dealership 
(Freightliner,Mack,Peterbilt,etc.).
