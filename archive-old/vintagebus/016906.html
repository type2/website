Thanks to all who sent suggestions on how to ground the tail lights properly,
to get a nice bright glow.

Unfortunately I did something wrong...while trying to hook it up, i think i
shorted out the stop light switch on the master cylinder. this is what i
did...

I took apart and cleaned the contacts on both tail lights, and while doing
this-i noticed that a previous owner had grounded the passenger side tailight.
As this tailioght worked quite brightly, i thought i woudl try a similar
thing. Unfortunately there were soem sparks...and i think somthing shorter
because now the tail lights work, but the brake lights don't. 

Is it possible to change the stop light switch on the master cylinder without
having to change the whole master cylinder(i just put a new master cylinder in
2 years ago-german made). I also would prefer to avoid having to bleed the
brakes right now, as i don't currently have access to the very good working
space.

thanks for any suggestions...
