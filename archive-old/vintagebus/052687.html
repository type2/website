 Hello all,
 
 My barndoor came with a 15&quot; crows foot spare rim, dated 5/57... It is mostly
 covered with rust, but I noticed the other day it still has some og black
 paint on it. What bus came with black rims in 57? Was that an option?
 Someone mentioned they thought spares might have been black. Anyone know
 anything regarding this?
 Thanks

I think the spares were the same colour as the wheels on the bus.   The spare 
for my 53 standard is the light beige/dark beige the bus was painted.  I am 
not sure when they dropped the painting the wheels the colour of the bus 
concept and switched to silver white- but I suspect it was when they went to 
the later style bumpers in 59.  cause the pressed bumpers were painted to 
match the bus, while the later bumpers were painted silver white.    Hm, 
wonder if that is when they stopped pin striping.  I've seen a very low 
milage 57 kombi ( kept in barn for 40 years) had white pinstripes on the dove 
blue paint.     It's stripes were crisp, the 54 kombi I had had the same pin 
stripes, very faded.  Any one seen OG pinstripes on buses with later bumpers? 
    Did they do them on trucks?

Is the black chestnut brown maybe?  if so it was probably from a deluxe.
