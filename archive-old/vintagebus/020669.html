Subject: Re: [VB] un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab

If it was springs pulled in the front, then it's just a matter
of finding some used springs and putting them back in.  In
the rear, you'll need to remove the spring plate and re-index it
to the torsion bar.
