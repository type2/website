Hi all,
Ran across a 71 Westy the other day. A little old man had it, said it
wouldnt run. Been sitting for about 9 months and was being used for a
storage shed. Got to looking around and all the camping equip was in very
good shape as was most of the bus. Fusebox was dangling and the drivers door
had had some mishap around the window frame but still opened and closed
alright. It needs new canvas up top as well as roof seals. He said the
original engine threw a rod thru the case, someone had installed an AE block
beetle engine for him. Anyway, haggled a little and towed it home for $750.
Got the engine started and it sounded like some kid beating on pots and pans
with a spoon. I got to doing a little better inspection on the engine and
found the rocker arm clip had come off of #4 exhaust. Put it back on and it
runs like a charm. Now for a question. This is my first bay window, since
the late model uprights had support in the rear and this is a car engine, is
something gonna break without a place for rear engine support? Also, where
was the HUGE vacuum line for the brake booster attached to the engine?
Thanks,
John in NC
