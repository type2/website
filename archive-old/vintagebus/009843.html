Don't say. I just bought NOS wiper arms today. Now I won't sleep until I get
them.

Later,

&gt; One more thing to beat the dead horse with is this:  People who list
things
&gt; as something they are NOT.   I won't name names as they might be reading.
&gt; Here is an example.   A part is listed as NOS but in the description the
&gt; seller says something like &quot;Ok its really not NOS but this thing is CLEAN
&gt; CLEAN CLEAN  I restored it and its just like NOS but better!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Give me a break!  If the F'ing thing is not NOS don't list it as such.
This
&gt; also goes for the people who insert &quot;not NOS&quot; in the title string so
people
&gt; searching &quot;NOS&quot; hit their auctions.
&gt;
&gt; Buyer beware.
