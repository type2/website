Subject: Re: [VB] Crew Cab Body Panels






&gt; 
&gt; OK, but I still don't know how dirt got &quot;inside&quot; the bus. Are there any
&gt; inner rockers or cargo floors on this bus? Was the PO off-roading with
the
&gt; cargo doors open?
&gt; 

I don't know either..could have.  I just assumed it came in through the
exhisting drain holes kicked up by the front/rear tires.

r&gt; 
&gt; There is plenty of room to get to the inside lap. All you have to do is
cut
&gt; the rocker high enough so that the inside lap is higher than the top edge
of
&gt; the inner rocker. I also fiberglass the lap on the inside of the bus.
BTW,
&gt; I'm working on crew cab, not a bus. I don't guess that makes a
difference,
&gt; does it?
&gt; 
Like I said more than one way to do it.  
 
&gt; I did lap welds because I can use a higher setting on my welder and get
&gt; better penetration. When you butt weld thin metal, you have to cut the
&gt; voltage way down and it takes more time to stitch such a long run. The
outer
&gt; lap also leaves a small gutter that I use to make my transition to the
&gt; existing panel using filler.

Personally I don't like to have to fill a &quot;gutter&quot; with filler.  Not that
it hurts anything...just a bit extra filler to have to work.

What ever works best for you.

Steve
