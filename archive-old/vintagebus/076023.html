Subject: [VB] Re: bus jams

&gt;...  Costs more but might sound a little
&gt;better.

i dunno - i routinely see harmon kardon computer speakers for $20 a 
pair, surplus.

&gt;
&gt;The inspection lamp socket in an ambulance was wired downstream of a fuse,
&gt;so 8,000 milliamps.  :)  However, if you wired it directly to the battery
&gt;hot wire at the fuse block, you'd basically have whatever the battery
&gt;could give you, modulo the resistance of ~1 m of 25.0 mm^2 cable (battery-
&gt;starter) and ~3.5 m of 6.0 mm^2 cable (starter-fuses).  Per DIN ISO 6722
&gt;part 3, via Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th edition, p. 792, that's (1 m *
&gt;0.743 milliohm/m) + (3.5 * 3.14 milliohm/m) = 11.7 milliohm or 0.0117 ohm.
&gt;Assuming a perfect battery (Thevennin resistance of zero) and no losses in
&gt;the ground side, shorting the cigarette lighter socket would result in a
&gt;current of about 1,020,000 milliamps - at least until the wiring catches
&gt;fire.

wow.
  matt, how much to come over and rewire my bus with me? i want to 
redo the gauges and accessories :)
seriously, i see a career in bus electrics upgrade for you - charge 
people to tell you want they want, design the circuitry and send em 
instructions. fly out for the $$$ ones :)


&gt;Seriously...A cigarette lighter jack can power almost any speaker system
&gt;that wants 12 V power.  It'll probably come with a wall-wart for 120 V use,
&gt;that will probably be rated between 500 and 2000 mA.  As long as the
&gt;speakers want 12 V, you can connect them directly to a lighter socket, no
&gt;problem.


cool - i wasn't sure how that worked; if i see, say, 600mA on the 
wall wart, i was worried the cig jack might pump out more and make 
toast.

i'm actually seeking to avoid the radio route; besides nothing worth 
listening to (f*ck you, clear channel), i had one burst into flames 
on me in heavy traffic once. i bet it looked hilarious... old bus 
tooling down the road, and a smoking radio is abruptly tossed out the 
passenger window.....
