Subject: black tar fuel tank
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I am restoring a 66 westy that has been sitting for ages. the fuel tank was
full of old gas that has evaporated into  black sludge like tar. i took it to
a radiator shop which acid bathed it and removed most of the crap but some
reside is left. does anyone know of something  to get this out. also would
like to seal coat the tank. any suggestions. 

thanks jim
