Well Hell!  I haven't posted much on this group.  Matter of fact I'm not
sure that I've posted on it since it split from Vanagon --&gt; Type II --&gt;
Vintagebus..
And I'm sad to say that this post is about parting with my '64 single cab.

I had great plans for it, but the fact is that since I changed job types about
4 years ago, I hardly have time for any extra-curricular activities as my job
is one that requires quite a bit of overtime.  So enough with the excuses
already.

Here are the particulars:

The body is pretty much straight with quite a bit of surface rust.  There
are three fixable holes: One under the battery, another on the drivers side
floor and one in the floor in the storage area.  All can be fixed by grafting
in donor pieces.  The gates are bowed out.  Whoops! I forgot to mention the
hole in the cab ceiling as one of the POs just had to have a CB antenna 
mounted up there.  The nose as a minor bump in it that looks fixable to me.
It has both a passenger and driver access panels to the compartment below
the bed.  The upper bed is, well, you know... it's there but in waves..
The engine is recently rebuilt along with the transmission and reduction
boxes.  I've put on brand new tires and have had the fuel tank cleaned and
resealed.  It is drivable but the lights and brake lights don't work.
Don't know why yet.  The wiring is tired and needs to begone through.  But
it runs and can be driven on the freeway.  I'm asking  $1,800.00 for it
which I think is a fair price.  That's all I'll say for now.  If you're
interested, then email me at:
