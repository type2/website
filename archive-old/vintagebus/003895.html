&gt; &gt; Sorry, but I don't see how driving a bus magically absolves you of the
&gt; &gt; responibilities of the usual driver.  It's people like this piloting
&gt; &gt; garbage with a VW badge on the front that's given the hobby the bad rap.
&gt; &gt; If this is what's on the road to AZ, then I guess I should just stay
home.

 I agree with the position that you should not put others in danger by
running a bus, or any other vehicle that is not road worthy, (e.g., slapped
together and missing the driver seat, etc.)  But where do you draw the line
Thom?  I don't think there is a gray area here.  You show pictures of your
&quot;parts bus&quot; driving on public roads.

Is it OK to drive &quot;garbage&quot; on the road when you do it?
