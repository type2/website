Subject: floor repair

So the bus I got this weekend needs a new floor. I haven't done this
before, and I am hoping for some been-there-done-that advice.
Problem areas are the usual: just inside the cargo doors, the
equivalent area on the driver's side, both passenger and driver
footwells. I have heard that replacement pieces are available for all
of these areas, but I haven't seen them for myself. Who makes the good
ones, and who sells them? And what is the best method of seaming them
with the sound part of the original floor? Overlap them? Butt them
together with some scrap underneath backing up the seam? Any advice on
how to get the cargo door latch holes (like what would be striker
plates) to be in the right place? This seems like an area where things
could easily go wrong.
And I have been thinking about the color. The original was 1313, but
that is what my other bus is. I want something different. Vanilla and
rootbeer? Vanilla and butterscotch? Maybe I should eat something sweet
and then think about it some more...
Thanks everybody,
Joel
