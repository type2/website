Hi Volks,
We agree, plus solder the light switch riveted internal and external pieces 
together.  See the type2 library for more info.  Plus solder all the brass 
clips in the fuse box in post-1960 VWs and the riveted parts in the earlier fuse 
boxes.  After that add either normal bulb or LED yellow tinted accessory signal 
lights to the rear of your VW for real noticable signals.
