&gt;&lt;&lt; We have also seen Hirshler (SP?) made antennas used on buses.  These are
&gt;the type of antennas that have a solid metal rod at the base of the antenna
&gt;that
&gt; has a slight hour glass taper to it.  Have seen these mounted to the left
of
&gt; the left windscreen and also center.  The left mounting the base is
mounted
&gt; at about a 45 degree angle to vertical and then the solid metal base of
the
&gt; rod it actually bent to vertical.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Though I am unsure of the name this sounds exactly like what I am running
on
&gt;my Binz (with original safaris)  I can Email a picture to Thom, Everett, or
&gt;somebody for posting if there is interest.  Let me know.
