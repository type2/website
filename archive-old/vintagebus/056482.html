Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

My '66 Westy is driven daily, except in the most severe winter weather.
I also have a '66 1300 beetle that my son drives daily to school.

Subject: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p


&gt;
&gt; all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it
&gt; politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following
&gt; poll:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; how many of you actually DRIVE your bus
&gt; DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT
a
&gt; honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot;
&gt; excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.
&gt;
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my
&gt; busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called
making the
&gt; heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned
to go
&gt; to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses
didn't
&gt; rust out.
&gt;
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of
&gt; miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i don't even own any other kind of car, so what
&gt; else WOULD i drive?!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i'm just curious.
