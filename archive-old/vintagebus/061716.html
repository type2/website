Subject: 67 bug to bus tranny swap

hi all,
&gt; In searching for a '67 swing axle tranny core, a local merchant claimed that I
could use the swing axle from a bug
&gt; (he has a rebuilt ready to roll!) if i switched the nosecones and swapped the
shift rod with the hockey stick bus
&gt; type.  Does anyone know if this is possible?  Has anyone done it with
success/problems?  The gear ratios look good,
&gt; and the physical sizes match.  I'm also a bit perplexed about the 4 reverse
gears issue, as I am totally unfamiliar
&gt; with bugs...clarification here would be appreciated as I would hate to make
that mistake!!
&gt; By the way, my reduction boxes are removed, and axles are in good shape; just
need to swap out the centers.
&gt; thanks in advance, and happy driving.
&gt; mark
