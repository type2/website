Subject: Shocks Ahoy!

Got another shock question.

After driving the 53 for a few weeks now I'm ready to go into the
hospital for head and back injuries due to the extreme jolting and
bouncing around in the cabin and hitting my head on the roof. Anymore
and it may throw me completely overboard.

Seriously though, I've expericenced this before. The front end on this
Barndoor bounces up and down like crazy when going over medium to large
dips but handles most small bumps fine. Now I'm thinking that the shocks
are gone and the torsion bars aren't able to stop from working as soon
as they should. What are the thoughts from you guys?
