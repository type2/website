So I got a question. I'm gonna use an oil bath aircleaner on the is 
engine set-up. It HAD one of the little round baja chrome things on 
it before. The oilbath cleaner has the 1&quot; port for the pre-heater 
pipe. I don't really want to use that. Can I just click the flap to 
stay open and run like that? I've got a block-off for the 
&quot;stove-pipe&quot; that comes thru the tin as well. The &quot;stove-pipe&quot; is the 
later bigger 2&quot; size that you see on bugs or whatever. So the 2 
openings don't match anyway. What do you think?

no, don't wire the flap open.   VW does recommend that when your average temp 
is above 70 and you dont want pre heat anymore.    (are you in the southern 
hemisphere?)  Start you motor, and go look at it- rev it up and you should 
see the flap open at higher revs.  now  get a 1&quot; tube, and feed it down the 
later big  pickup so you draw hot air from by the head, and attach it to the 
round bit on the air cleaner.  when you start your motor, you should soon 
feel that the tube is warm- bringing warmed air to your carb.  smile.
