Subject: `62 Double cab for sale Best offer over $2000
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi,

Found a `62 double cab a local fellow has.  It is a
arizona vehicle originally...been in a storage shed in
Ohio for past 20 years...original paint, some surface
rust on undercarridge but no holes or repairs needed. 
Very straight and original...original engine too.

This is NOT my bus and the guy is not a friend of mine
just a stranger who has a decent bus for sale.

I have seen it and have the guys phone...email me for
info or his number.  It is in Clyde Ohio.  Nice bus
needs work but very very solid and straight and all
there.

Todd
