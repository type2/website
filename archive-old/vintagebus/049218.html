Interesting point about the two-tone paint, specifically the SK on the m-code.  I originally thought SK also stood for ~Special Kolor, but after some research, somewhere, I thought I determined that it stood for Sikkens (sp?), which I also thought was another German paint manufacturer similar to Glasurit, that was used for early Westfalia's, as well as all *special vehicles*, like fire trucks, etc.
