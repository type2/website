&gt;Toys 'R' Us has a 1:18 scale version of the Hot Wheels drag bus...Anyone else
&gt;ever seen one of these?

Toys 'R Us ran an ad in the sunday paper about a month ago showing it. I
went to the local store here in San Angelo, TX and they didn't have even
one (even though the computer showed they should have 2). So my wife had
them check the other stores. Some store in OK had 14 cases of 'em!!!!! ( 4
in each case!!!). So they had 4 cases shipped here to San Angelo &amp; I got my
one. I didn't buy anymore 'cause I don't feel like having to deal with
re-selling them. They are VERY cool though....&amp; I don't even really like
the drag busses that much. Now I think this may just be the coolest toy
I've got. It's a real eye grabber.
