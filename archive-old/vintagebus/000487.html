&lt;&lt; What of the multi rated oils that are GL4/GL5?&gt;&gt;
Hi,
Just get GL-4.  Sta-Lube has a 85/90 Wt. that is availible most everywhere in 
USA.
 
&lt;&lt;If I drain the tranny and add the GL4 with that be enough to remove the 
offending chemical?&gt;&gt;
Probably Okay.  You need to change the oil anyway on new or mystery tranny 
after the first oil change at about 1,000 miles then every 20-30,000 miles 
after that.
