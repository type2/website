&lt;&lt; This message made me wonder about my rack....   does anyone know what 
style/model/era my rack is? &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
It is an early (Maybe even into the very late 50s.) to late 60s full length 
German rack supplied by VAG to VOA.  Do not remember the name of the 
manufacture right now.  For the 1/3 and 2/3 models of this rack had an 
additional accessory kit that could be bought with the rack or later and 
installed by the VW owner.  This kit clamped on lengthwise wood strips onto 
the floor of these racks to prevent marring of luggage.  This manufacture of 
roof rack also made the German bus roof rack ladder for these racks.
