Subject: More shift rod questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am in the process of attempting to replace the
plastic bushing and the &quot;shift rod guide&quot; on the front
shift rod of my 65 doublecab.  This is the type with
the metal guide that goes around a plastic sleeve that
fits around the shift rod itself.  (The guide ring is
broken, making for interesting shifting.)
The front shift rod slides over the front end of the
rear shift rod, and is fastened with a steel collar
with one set screw.
The set screw was broken off.  I drilled it out, and
then cut the collar into half with a grinder, but
cannot seperate the two shift rod parts.  I have
soaked it with penetrating oil, but don't want to use
a torch on it as it is less than an inch away from the
insulation around the main heat duct.  I may resort to
using a torch if I can rig up enough insulation and
heat shielding.
Any suggestions as to what I can try next??
Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

Jim
