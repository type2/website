Subject: Re: [VB] not a weekender double cab RE.BUSSES AND BOATS

Hi John,
My name is Mike Breckenridge and I've just bought a '60 DC. I just moved to St.
Rt. 314 between Chesterville and Sparta some 30-40 mi. No. of Columbus, Oh. and I
would like to socialize with Oh. Type II owners.

Mike

&gt; hey all ,
&gt;
&gt;        How many of us are going to cruise to busses and boats ? I was Just
&gt; curious
&gt; Because I have three split window type 2's but would not want to camp in any
&gt; of them. I have two trucks and a panel van . I think I may just drive down on
&gt; saturday ?
&gt; Is it permissable to just show up to check out the busses ?  how many listees
&gt; plan to attend . I was thinking of gathering names of bus fans from the Ohio
&gt; area.
&gt; I will have my digital camera on hand to show pictures on my site
&gt; www.ohiobusworks_dot_com .     thanks John Clancy
