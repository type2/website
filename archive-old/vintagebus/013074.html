&lt;snip&gt;I 
want to get it out and was wondering if it would be easier to take the cargo 
floors out and clean and treat or visa versa with the belly pans......&lt;unsnip&gt;

Well, from what I have seen there are 2 billion spot welds in the floor, and about a billion welds (tack welds I think) on the belly pans, so I would say belly pans.  I have only disassembled them, never put them back together, so maybe the metal experts will have a more accurate answer.  I think Rob King and Thom both have buses with big chunks of floor removed.
