Subject: [VB] Free '62 shell for parts

'62 Standard bus located in Newnan, GA (35 min S of Atlanta).  Free, just come with a trailer (or tow dolly) and four tires, n' it's yours.  I will be cutting the bottom of the nose off of it for my Westy, and that's probably about it.  I haven't done the work yet...if somebody is interested in taking the whole bus, I'd trade it for a good solid nose, even just the lower part -- but frankly, I don't think it's worth fixing up.  Rusty, banged up, and almost completely stripped by the PO.

What's left: small-nut tranny, front end, brake drums, rear hatch (exc. shape), front bench, and some bits n' pieces.  I think there's a steering wheel in it somewhere.  The two front doors are in pretty nice shape.  The cargo doors have cancer in the bottoms, but it hasn't eaten to the outer metal yet.  Some of the body metal could be salvaged, if your bus has the ubiquitous PO access-hatch cut over the engine, this one does not.  Roof rear of the front cab is good, there is a sizable dent up front from a tree branch.

I won't part out the bus, it's all or nothing.  If nobody is interested, I will scrap the body but pull stuff like the rear hatch, bench, etc so it isn't wasted.  I won't keep the big stuff like the tranny and front end though, already got those lying around :-P  Please p-mail if interested or for more info.

Andrew W.
