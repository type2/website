Subject: Roo Bars - late aussie friday entry

Its not friday, but us aussies miss the US friday posts coz we're so far
ahead. Anyway, some aussie roo-bar stories:

Pulled up at a truck stop in outback South Aus. Theres a guy hosing out all
the wheel-arches of his road train (a semi with at least 3 trailers - very
long truck!). There's mostly read chunky bits falling out of the arches, and
theres 24 arches! YUK. I asked him what he hit, he said he came over a rise
and plowed through an herd of sheep - no way of stopping. He guessed around
20+ sheep now paved the road. &quot;Gotta get it off now coz by tommorrow it'll
smell like a dogs breakfast&quot;

When you hit a brumby (wild horse) in a 4WD with a good roo bar, you tend to
trip it so it falls on your bonnet (hood), and if your unlucky it will join
you on your lap in the drivers compartment. Not pretty. I was sitting in the
back of a ute travelling 80kph on a dirt road in the Northern Territory when
this happened to me. Spent the rest of the night crimping the broken
radiator cores where they were pushed into the fan. Bloody water-cooled
junk, it'll never catch on. To its credit the Toyota got us back to camp,
with no lights, no bonnet and less one fender.

As for those pesky 'roos, I've seen a roo jump off an embankment onto the
roof of the moving car in front, back onto the embankment, back onto the
bonnet of the car and then bounce off into the bush. Talk about a thrill
seeker!
