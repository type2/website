hey Ronnie, it's not clear from your post which bushings / bearings you mean. 
 And how that affects the freeing process.   ???  But you have books, don't 
you?  Did you ever dig them out from the storage area?
Clara
.......
I could be wrong but don't barndoor beams use bushings instead of bearings??

Clara, E+B, where's the books when you need them

Well,


not wishing to be the harbinger of doom

or anything, but it sounds like the 

torsion arms are well and truly

rusted on....


This can be an utter buzzard and more

difficult to solve than the famous

rusted on front shift coupler...or the rusty cable stuck

in the cable tube problem.......


I'd try a gentle tap first just to see if it looks like

the arms will come off.  Probably not.


Then I'd drill a some holes in the top of the

front beam tubes and fill both with 

penetrene or whatever....I'd do it a few times


I'd then try and move the ends.  A little heat

on the torsion arm ends where they are held

onto the torsion arm leaves may help at this 

point........


Then I'd try and dismantle the beam/leaves.
