Subject: Re: [VB] Starter going?

Hi Greg,
Do try Gene's starter clean up proceedure.  It is a good idea to take the 
starter itself apart and clean it of starter brush dust and check if you need to 
solder in new brushes (brushes as short or shorter than the cages they fit in 
need to be replaced).  Also a good idea to check the electrical system with a 
voltage meter for voltage drop and check ground straps.  Have seen battery 
ground straps fail often.
