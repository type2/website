&lt;&lt; However, my most recent fill-up (which didn't involve switching tanks)
 had me putting in 10.24 US gallons.  How big *is* the main tank? &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
If you get the bus tilted to the left enough you can easily get a little over 
11 gallons in there.  Since the outlet of the tank is so far forward do not 
be to surprised on long steep uphills that you have to go to reserve early 
when the fuel shifts to the rear of the tank away from the outlet.  We have 
done this several times going through the Siskiyous mountians in N. CA. and 
once back on flats switched back to normal position for 20-30 miles before 
needing to finally switch into reserve again for that last gallon of fuel.
