Whats the easiest way to lower a bus ???? 

I have a bus to bring  to  the show this weekend that would look so much 
better if it was lowered  2-3 inches.......

but I do not have the time to do it by then.....

So.....any ideas ?  pallet of sand bags or ??? reverse air shocks !!!  or
????

what I would like is something I can do for the show and is  easy to un-do
at 
the end of the show.........I can bring my floorjack !!!!!

thanks for your help...........praise the lowered
