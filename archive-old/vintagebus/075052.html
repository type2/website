Subject: RE: [VB] bus on the highway

  At the Classic I bought a few sets of OG Hella marker lights. These are
going on the container van, all around the top, just light a semi. I also am
installing NEW euro tail lights to make sure all works great and bright. I
did put a bigger engine and different geared trans and even with the engine
not runnig right, I still crusied at 65 mph. 
  All my buses have bigger engines and now you all know why, I like to at
least cruise the speed limit, up and down hills.

ronnie

ps. I have 8ply 6.70/15 bias plys on the container van and in my opinion
they seem more stable then any of the 8 ply raials I have on my other buses.
Ordered another set today for one of my buses.

 I am glad to see that Dawn and crew came out of this alive
 
 One thing buses need are larger rear lights, look at barndoor and later 50s

 tailights , 
 how far can you really see them ?
 and if you are going 50mph and the trucker 70-80mph , well by the time he 
 sees your lights its too late......
  &gt;&gt;
I'm glad no one got more than a bruise. 
 &amp; I'll second that about visibility.  

my barndoor, which has the tiny tallights and paint washed off by acid rain 
and sun.

is not the most visible vehicle going down the road.   It's kinda a dark
spot 
that people's eyes pass right over as of it doesn't exist.   I got a bunch
of 
reflectors at the dollar store and stuck them on the back.   Maybe I should 
have stuck them to magnets to stick them on.     I tend to arrange for a
tail 
car that's brightly painted with brighter lights to follow if I'm going to a

show via the freeway (at 50mph).

Funny thing is people sometimes pass the tailcar, then zip in behind the 53,

and it takes them a little while to realise the old, ratty bus is actually 
really going to keep driving slow.

Having a bright white bumper really helps others see you.  Some point after
I 
got the 65 painted I went and painted the rear bumper.  A friend said that 
bright white bumper really made the bus more visible.  

but I think the paint issue is crucial.  If I got the old bus painted it 
would be much more visible and noticed, thus safer.  Bright reflective
striped 
tape on the back would be good.   When I get my truck going I'll paint the
bumper 
red/white stripes.

guy with a bd panel in the area has a big stick on magnetic sign he puts on 
the back that says something like 

&quot;36hp at work
max speed 50mph
no turn signals- watch for hand signals,
brake light   -&gt;&quot;                                            ..............

I want one

driving 60mph on the I-5 freeway does not feel unsafe.  In this area. (PNW)

In the central valley they drive like a video game, but, I'm not there very 
much :)  

I guess my suggestion is make sure your bus is visible, at least rattle can 
that bumper bright white, and make sure the taillights are bright.  Some 
drivers are just idiots and oughta be confined, but at least make sure they
see you.
