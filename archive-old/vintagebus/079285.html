Subject: Re: [VB] re:exhaust

  If you can find an older issue of Hot VW's there is an exhaust test done on a stock 1600. This testing was done on 
the dyno by Geoff Hart Racing (we are lucky that he now resides in Lake Havasu). In this test he used stock and about 
every avaliable header system out there. You might want to look at this test before making a decision.
   I have personally found a lack of bottom end torque with a header on a 1600, but an increase in upper end torque.

&gt;Sorry I meant to say the existing muffler is a single-quiet exhaust pak. 
&gt;
&gt;I guess mine is 1 3/8&quot; tubing, I just saw it is also  available with 1 1/2&quot;
&gt;tubing, what does the larger tubing get you?
