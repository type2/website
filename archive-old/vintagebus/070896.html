Subject: Removing Steering Column tube??

How do you remove the Steering Column tube?  Bentley doesn't seem to cover it.
I bought a tight steering box today for my Bus.  Problem is the outer tube is
rusted, almost through, were it went through the floor.  Almost looks like it
may be easier to just weld the crack fill in the rust pits.
I'd really like to use my tube that's in the Bus now.
