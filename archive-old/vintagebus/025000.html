&gt;  lie under the front of the bus (splash pan off) and have a helper wiggle the
&gt; steering wheel gently in the loose area. Llook for loose ends of the tie rods
&gt; and drag link, up and down play in the center pivot means the swing
&gt; lever/bushings need replacement.

I was just doing this at the weekend - I noticed a
little bit of play in virtually everything :(

Worst offender is actually the swing lever where there
is noticeable movement back and forth. Front beam out
methinks and replace all the worn joints/bushings (if I
can source them)

Getting those tie rod ends off is going to be
interesting!
