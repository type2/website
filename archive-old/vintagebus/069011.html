Subject: Accel cable: rear guide sleeve over tranny?

Is the accel cable supposed to be inside a plastic sleeve or something
from where it exits the metal tube above the rear torsion housing to the
front (FIF) of the fan housing?  Seems like I've seen that on others, but
none on my 65.  I didn't see a pic of one in Bentley.

The bare cable had actually sawn a slot in the tranny case!  I think it
would have snagged or broken long ago if the tranny wasn't covered with
slime.
