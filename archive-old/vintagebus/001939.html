Hi all, we just got a '57 kombi (I think, has three popouts on each side) with some kind
of camper conversion inside. Our question is how can we tell who manufactured the kit, or
was this some kind of home built thing? I can't find any kind of sticker or plate anywhere
on the bus IDing it. Right behind the front bench is a small dinette? that makes into a
bed and in the back is a little cabinet with a couple of doors. there's also a small
cabinet right at the front behind the passenger seat. wood paneling covers the sides and
roof. Any ideas on what this might be?

The bus is very straight, and rust free, just some dents here and there, and the passenger
door is rusted out at the bottom of the door, but the floor is solid and still has what
looks like the factory primer, and under it looks just as good. someone did cut the rear
bumper for a later 1600 bug engine and muffler

Over all I think that we got a fun little bus to work on :)

I'll try to get some pic's up soon so you all can take a good look at it :)
