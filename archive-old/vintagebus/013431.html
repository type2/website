Quite a while ago, several months I think, I asked about these
pump/filter units and their price and availability but no one replied.  

Assuming decent machining and fit of the oil pump, the added filter sure
couldn't hurt.  The increased oil capacity would also help, I suppose.

Two questions:

	What size filter is used?  (I'm assuming it's a screw-on
cartridge)

	Could these pump/filter units be adapted for use on a later Type
2 with the rear engine mounting bar?
