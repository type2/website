Hi Kevin A.,
With the DP 044 heads you might have problems with low end torque.  Have had 
friends who loved the 1776 with SP head and dual carbs for the bus.  If you 
do go to 1776 get a case with the thicker casting in front of #3 cylinder 
bore or have a case welded/thickened there to prevent cracking.  Make sure 
the machine shop that bores the case for the bigger diameter cylinders leaves 
a radius in the bottom of the bore to also prevent cracking of the case!
