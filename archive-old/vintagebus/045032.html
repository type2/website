&lt;&lt; So, would you kind folk mind sharing this formula with the rest of us, so
 we can use it side by side with other formulas for deriving these numbers? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Who us?
RPM x tire diameter measured at horizontal :)
Divided by
ratio of gear used x ratio of final drive x 336

This all gives you what your tranny would do without reductions.  To figure 
what you get with reductions.  
Divide your former result by 1.39 (28%) for small nut reductions used from 
MAY59-63 or by 1.26 (24%) for large nut reductions used from 1964-67.
