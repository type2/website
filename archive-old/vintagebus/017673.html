Well, if you saw the sorry shape this poor lunchwagen is in, you'd understand.
What's more important - that the survival of the &quot;authenticity&quot; of the car, or 
the survival of the car itself?

&gt; &lt;&lt; Basically what someone needs to do is take a double-door and move the

&gt;  enough project as it is... &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, then it wouldn't be so unique then, would it? I don't know why this 
&gt; bothers me so much, but it does. If you were to take another panel and 
&gt; convert all of the lunch bus stuff to that, then where is the authenticity of 
&gt; it actually being a coachbuilt. It's like turning kombis into deluxes. I 
&gt; understand the current panel needs lots of work, and would be real expensive,
