&gt;[Tail light grounding] Steel you can solder to if you have a high enough
&gt;wattage soldering iron or carefully use a propane soldering tip on a
&gt;propane torch or even an old fashioned blow torch and soldering iron.
&gt;Cast potmetal you have to drill and nut and screw the wire to or better
&gt;yet in a thick area of the potmetal thread for more surface area.

As I understand it, you are talking about connecting to the reflector
somewhere.  The potential problem I see with that, at least on the '61
up large oval rear lights, is that the socket can get loose from the
reflector.  On the tail light housings I have (one OG 1963, two OG 1966,
and one modern-day knockoff) the socket is held to the reflector by four
little crimp tabs and can loosen up over time.  This happened to my '63
tail light.  The '66 and modern sockets have ground tabs riveted to the
reflector with a spring tab that touches the socket, but even that isn't
always enough - I thought I had cleaned the socket and spring tab and
made sure they were touching, but I still had a bad ground on one of my
'66 sockets.

What I like to do is use a small worm-gear pipe clamp around the socket
itself, trapping the ground wire between the clamp and the socket.  That
way, even if the socket comes loose from the reflector, the socket is
still grounded.  Doing this cured the bad ground I had on one of my '66
sockets with the ground tab and spring.

I realize that it may not be possible to do this on the earlier lights
that don't have a full round tube around the bulb base.
