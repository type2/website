Don't use a floating arm sender--it can be very aggravating to install
one in a splittie bus tank.  I tried one for awhile--BFY sold it to me,
claimed that it replaced the cylinder type (one of the reasons I don't
use BFY anymore).  I had to tinker repeatedly with the bend of the
floating arm and finally gave up and found a replacement cylinder type. 
Reason:  the holes to mount the sender to the tank are not symettric
(sp) so you can only mount it in one orientation, and when you do the
floating arm gets hung up on the baffles in the tank!  PITA!

&gt;     Back on the subject, my working fuel gauge does that exact thing!
&gt; It reads empty when I actually have half a tank left.  I replaced the
&gt; original tube sender with a floating arm one.  Does anyone have this
&gt; problem with aftermarket senders that don't reach all the way down into
&gt; the tank?  Has anyone bought an accurate aftermarket sender that reads
&gt; accurately?  Can I bend it a little so that my gauge can be more
&gt; accurate on the lower half of the tank instead of the upper when I know
&gt; I'm o.k. on fuel???  ---J.D.
