Subject: BBB V update

I will be doing BBB V updates as the weekend goes on as long as people want
to know.

Last night we had the entry bag stuffing party at VW Howards house ten buses
have arrived from as far away as West Virgina, 5 from New Mexico (JP, Berry
and his troops drove straight through, they only lost 1 on the way in
Williams), 1 from Phoenix and 3 from So Cal.

This morning as I was at the site there were a couple more buses camped
there. As I was leaving to come to work Gabe (the key guy) drove in, he
drove straight through from No. Cal.
There were also buses at Dennys (eating) so the count goes on.

No signs of Racheal yet, but will keep all posted.

There is still time to come if you haven't made up your mind yet (THOM)

Weather is beautiful, no wind, clear skys and Sunshine.

ronnie   BBB V  getting the TACOS ready for tonight.
