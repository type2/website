Subject: [VB] Question about me 40IDF's


One thing that has bothered me about these carbs is that I don't have any
idle stops.  The adjustment screws are there but the rod that opens and
closes the butterflies in each carb came without the factory piece that
allows you to just crack open the butterflies.  I can see that if I don't
put this piece in, the butterflies eventually will wear a goove in the
venturi of the carb.  Does anyone know where I can get this part?  I would
need 2 of them (1 for each carb.)  Maybe another call to Kymco is in order?

Later!
