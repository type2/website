Subject: Ride Height - Minutes and Hours

The title sounds stupid, but there is a certain method to the madness on 
setting up rear torsion bar splines.

A guy I know in the local PCA who races an early 944 had the whole thing 
written out down to the minute details... But it was all over my head at the 
time :(

So the question is, is there a site or good book reference that explains how 
to set these up properly?  Seeing as I need to do the bus in a few weeks.

Also there is some angle meter ruler thing that is supposed to help, but I 
have never seen one...  Is this necessary?  Are they redily available?

... Entering new territory is a scary thing :)

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
