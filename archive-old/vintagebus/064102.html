Subject: Transport Companies

So this means that even if I pay them extra $200.00 I might not see the Bus
and my money at all?

&gt; Hey, Andre -
&gt;
&gt; I went out to visit southerland Auto Transport today. It is a travel
trailer
&gt; parked behind a double wide. The proprieter would not give me his name and
&gt; for me to describe his manner as abrupt would be kind. His bottom line was
&gt; &quot;There is a civil contract I have not violated - cash has priority!&quot; With
&gt; that, he was done talking to me. I would grade him poorly in customer
service
&gt; . . .
&gt;
&gt; Translation: He is following the letter of the law (civil) and has
committed
&gt; no defined crime. He does not treat his fellow brother very well and only
&gt; follows the dollar. Either way, it looks like he is into you for $200 more
&gt; than you had hoped. The only way for you to make him give you the money
back
&gt; would be in a long and counterproductive civil lawsuit - it would cost you
&gt; more to get it that the $200.
