Reminds me of why I am into splitties. It's a worthwhile challenge to rescue
old buses before they get crunched. I really appreciated the pics. thanks,

Well I'm pulling a nice 65 out of a field this weekend and it will be 
forsale, I'm going to get it road worthy. If someone is interested its a 65 std kombi 
I think it has middle seat, I will be putting in a rebuildt 71 type 3 engine 
with bady dellortos, It does have rusty rockers an the front floor under 
drivers feet need work ,dog legs are solid cargo floor is solid frame is great.
This bus should not have been sitting in a field as soon as the engine 
stopped running the po just took it and set it in the field and stoored oak dressers 
in it

its located in NC and price depends on how much work I put into it. this is 
in better shape then my 67 westy daily driver.
