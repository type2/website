&gt; Do NOT install a fuel-filter in the engine compartment between the fuel pump

Mine has one in this position, stuck in by a local
mechanic a couple of weeks ago while troubleshooting a
different problem, and I've seen others. Is this
position unsafe, or is it a bad place fullstop? Does it
reduce the efficiency of the fuel flow? 

I still have some problems related to this area; when I
go straight to idle after running at speed it stalls,
but if I reduce the revs more gradually, going down the
gears, then it will usually be OK.

Where's the best place to stick the fuel filter?

Cheers
Chris
