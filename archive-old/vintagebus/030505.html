&gt; i remember that bentley had been putting a bunch of their manuals into pdf

&gt; cheaper...and therefore our costs less. I know that nothing beats a real book,

Kevin, do you own a pre 1963 VW type2 ?
What type of manual do you use on your vehicles?
Nothing beats a Bentley. Nothing in english that is...

I wouldn't want to use my desk top for roadside repairs.
or even a fragile three thousand dollar notebook .
A $100 book is a lot more practical.

To all you guys and gals who have ideas on
.PDF or CDROM Bentleys;
Stop thinking  and please sigh the petition.
