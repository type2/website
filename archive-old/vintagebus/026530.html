Yesterday, a coworker asked me how many miles I've got
on my bus. 232,000 I proudly told him. &quot;Wow! What year
is it?&quot;. A 1970 I told him. But according to the sticker
inside the door, it rolled off the assembly line in August
of 1969 - possibly during the Woodstock Music Festival.
That's what I like to think anyway.

For the rest of the day, the mileage figure was tickling the
back of my head, but I couldn't figure out why. It's a number
I have heard before in connection with something else. After
work today, as I was heading to the parking lot it hit me. 230,000
miles is approximately the mean Earth-Moon distance!

As I settled in for my 25 mile commute home, I began to imagine
driving to the Moon. The building where I work was the Earth,
and home was the Moon. The entire 230,000 journey would be
compressed into an ordinary 25 mile jaunt. As I hit the interstate,
I imagined a special, invisible road heading upward. I soon left
the other cars behind, heading out into space. I shot through the
clouds, above the ozone, and into the ionosphere - that part of the
atmosphere which is ionized by the Sun's powerful radiation. By
now I was floating high above the Earth, and looking back revealed
no sign of civilization. Only a beautiful blue and white streaked marble

curved away beneath me.

As the traffic thinned out, I was entering the interplanetary void. My
trusty bus played along with the game by simulating the frigid solitude
of empty space, and I had to don my coat and gloves to protect me
from the icy grip of the vacuum. Soon the Moon began to lose its
usual appearance. The soft grandfatherly face was replaced with
enormous craters, jagged peaks, and ejecta from violent collisions
occurring eons ago. My stalwart companion knew the way to go,
having been preprogrammed by an impeccable fleet of young
physicists in white shirt sleeves and thin black ties.

Soon we began out descent. The craters, usually viewed from
above, now assumed their true three dimensional stature. Impossibly
high circular canyons waiting to swallow anything that came too
close. The preprogrammed landing site was finally coming into view.

&quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot; I was heard to say calmly over the
intercom. The soulless ripples of the electromagnetic field were all
that connected me to humanity. &quot;The landing site is filled with
boulders - switching to manual&quot;. Back home, a wave of worried
glances propagated through the control room.

Despite the complexity of the task before me, my body somehow
knew what to do. The brain began calculating and updating the
velocity vectors that would land me safely of the surface. Each
limb then performed an independent, specific function, taking
into account the unending flood of information coming from
the brain:

  Left foot - clutch
  Right foot - brake
  Left hand - turn signal
  Right hand - helm

&quot;3 meters..... down a half................. &quot;

The brain of every Eathling becomes locked in phase. &quot;Will he
make it?&quot; An embarrased truck driver listening to the news
on the radio wipes away a trickle of tears that he does not
understand.

Power bus A offline, Main engine shutdown........

&quot;Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.&quot;
