&gt; I've run this setup for years, and have had no problems.  I use an oil pump and
&gt; oil pump cover that I bought a long time ago from Gene Berg, and run Fram PH8A
&gt; filters, which are commonly available.

I have to recommend against using the PH8A... you risk ballooning,
blowouts, and general filter failure with them. They are *much* more
affordable than the Fram HP-1 filters, but they do not have the burst
capacity (and, I imagine, the flow rate) that the HP-1 does, which is
why Gene Berg wouldn't sell them with his full-flow kits. The extra
money that I pay gives me peace of mind, FWIW. I've found them here in
Knoxville for between $6.50 and $9.00 or so.

I don't think it matters too much where the filter is mounted... IMHO.
Mine went between the stock Westy hitch mount and where the engine
hanger mount goes, bolted to that kinda 45 degree angle piece... I
haven't had a rock hit it yet, but wise it would be to guard against
this... Perhaps a screen wire/sheet metal guard or something... ???
	Some people have said that they mount the filter outside of the engine
compartment to keep the extra heat out of it... much like Hoover's
concept of the pushrod tubes being little radiators... releasing heat
down there. It might not make any difference at all.
	Definitely keep the fittings located above the oil filter... if it
faces down the oil will drain out (and be nasty at oil-change time.). I
like to fill up my new oil filter with oil before installing it on the
filter mount, too. I was instructed to do that in the wrecker shop... I
hadn't thought about it much before then, but it kept the engine from
cranking without oil too long... and those engines would go 100,000
miles with *very* hard (ab)use, so I'm sure every little bit helped,
even though they weren't of the Mg/Al alloy we hold so dear. 

respectfully, my opinions...
