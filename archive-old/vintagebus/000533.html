&lt;&lt; I want to swap a small nut tranny for a big nut.  Are there any suprises

 I have to look for, or is it a direct and easy swap?  I'm changing the whole

 help!

if you are putting this in your 66, then it should be easy as the 66 should 
have a big nut one anyway.

some things to do while doing this.

change shift rod bushings
new engine compartment seal
new gear oil and axle boots
new fuel line
make sure you have grommets where the fuel line/ wirees/etc going into the 
engine compartment/through tin
replace rear brake hoses if it hasn't been done in the past 5 years
replace rear brake parts as needed
clean and grease brake adjustment stars
wipe all wires clean- grease degrades the coating they harden and crack :(
new shift coupler- they are cheap- and wire the screws so they dont fall out. 
 Get you a 8mm square headed socket, life is good with one of those when you 
deal with those 8mm square headed screws in the shift linkage.

get grommet for the shift rod tube- I couldn't. WW had them in the cataolg 
but none in stock and no one else clamed to even have them.  If anyone does, 
I want some.  I used some other stuff for this purpose.   

new front and rear tranny mounts- those rubber things.

How about your main seal and oil cooler seals?   Easy to change as your motor 
is out.

just some ideas- yea it makes it all take more time, but these things are 
easier to do when it's apart.
