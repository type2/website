If the list can stand one more tire question...
I was takling to the guy at the local Big-O about tires for my 1960 panel.
I explained that I needed something with a good load rating and stiff
sidewalls, based on what I have been reading here lately.  He recommended a
kelly 215 LT six ply, and said they are available with a variety of tread
choices.  Cost about $60 each.  He seems to know his stuff, and he has two
late 60s type busses, a single cab, and a thing so I have to like the guy.
Does anyone have any experience with the Kelly tires?
Thanks,
Bill Cobabe
