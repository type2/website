Subject: Gas Heaters

So I got together with a few semi-local bus guys today to work on gas heaters.
Problem with my BN 2.  The fuel pump works but it won't work properly. When it
is wired to a switch and battery and the switch is turned on the fan goes but
the pump does not work unless it is wired directly to the battery.  Is this a
relay problem?  Are BN 2 relays hard to come by?

Thanks In Advance
