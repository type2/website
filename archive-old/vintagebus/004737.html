Umm...they're probably just telling you to pull it off in hopes that you'll
sell it to them !-)

&gt; And speaking of the governor.  Everyone told me to pull mine off and make
it
&gt; easier.  I would like to keep mine but it is still missing the cover.  If
&gt; everyone seems to pulling theirs off there must be a spare someone would
be
&gt; willing to sell :)
