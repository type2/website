Subject: Re: [VB] Re: shifter extension

&gt;I have had a couple requests to post my shifter extension website address
&gt;again.  I have updated since the first posting.
&gt;
&gt;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/thatvwguy/myhomepage/auto.html
&gt;
&gt;Several went out this week and should be with their new owners now or will be
&gt;very soon.  Thanks for the orders guys!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Dan Kinsey
&gt;Double and single bend shifter extensions.


I have received my new shift extension from Dan, and it looks very nice.
I'll let y'all know how it fits when I get around to putting it on my bus.
