&gt; &gt;Does anyone know what kind of bags the tent and
&gt; poles came in for a
&gt; &gt;driveaway tent? Did they vary by year?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a tattered blue cloth bag for mine -- it's
&gt; not a duffle, but a bag you set the tent in and then
&gt; flaps close over the top, sorta like closing a box. 
&gt; Poles on mine came 
&gt; in an old army duffle, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK I've never seen good pix of Driveaway tent or
&gt; pole bags, but I'd guess they're not as
&gt; stripey-colorful as the ones for earlier tents.  I
&gt; stole a clue from Jim Ellis and 
&gt; carry my poles rolled up in a small tarp - removing
&gt; them from the duffle was always a PITA.
&gt; 
&gt; There probably are year variations since the tent
&gt; design was tweaked a few times.  I'd guess the bags
&gt; were made from whatever was lying around.
