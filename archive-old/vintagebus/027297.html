Subject: Templates for Westy wood?

I saw a mention of templates for sundial camper wood pieces. Does anyone
have patterns for Westy cabinets?  I would like to make some for my
standard, and would love to be able to cut from a pattern.  Are there
any copyright issues with this?

Thanks,
Jon 65 standard
