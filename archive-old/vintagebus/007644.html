Hi all -

I wanted to thank everyone on the Vanagon list for all the compliments I've
received on the Vanagon screensaver (still available at
www.transporter_dot_org).

So, in a two-handed grab for more glory, I wanted to expand the offer to all
forms of Transporters.

Send me your scanned picture of your splittie, loaf, Vanagon, or Eurovan and
I'll collect the pictures and turn them into a screensaver for each
generation of Volkswagen bus/van/box...

Send your pictures in any form you have (JPEG is best) and I'll post the
screensavers on my website.  And I promise, when I post them I'll let all
the lists know.

I'll make sure to try and download emails 3 times a day, but if my mailbox
does get filled up, please be patient and send again a little later.
Thanks.
