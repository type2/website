Howdy Ya'all,

I'll be flying down to DFW Friday morning to visit with a good friend 
Dennis Wilson who lives and works out in Princeton, kinda NE of 
the metroplex, up by Denton and McKinney.  Dennis is doing the 
body work / paint / restoration on my May of '59 Double Cab and 
it's coming along nicely.  We'll be dousing &quot;Shiner Bock's&quot; and 
doing body work all weekend long with the occasional trip to the 
local German restaurant.  If any of you want to get together, klink 
some glass and check out some Busses, call Dennis at the shop 
at Wilco Metal Products in Princeton at (800) 685-0619.  I'll fly back 
to St. Louis Monday evening, and I hope to get to meet a few of 
you there.

P.S.   To add to that truck vs Bus bumper thread, Charlie Hammill, 
a &quot;Bus God&quot; if there ever was one, once described to me that if you 
couldn't find a sharp cornered &quot;truck&quot; bumper for your early single 
or double cab, you could modify the upper inside corner of the &quot;Bus&quot; 
slash-type blade on each side carefully with a grinder to more 
correctly match the sharp corners on those Busses.  

P.S.S   For you trivia and Vintage Nazis (I'm proudly one of 'em) 
here is what VW's &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; (the VW Factory 
record of changes) has to say about Bus and truck bumpers:

on 29 Aug 1958, as of chassis #384 875, the bumpers were now of 
a &quot;stronger design&quot; (new &quot;slash&quot; type bumper replaces the &quot;ribbed&quot; 
style bumpers) ( USA models got the new bumper blades and bumper 
guards and overrider tubes) and also as of this date the &quot;starting 
handle is no longer supplied&quot; (crank start handle).

Then on the 5th of Jan 1960, as of chassis #554 147 the Bus rear 
bumper is &quot;now a standardized design for all Transporters, 
including Pick-ups&quot;.

Unfortunately, &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; says absolutely nothing 
about the date and Bus chassis # when they changed from the &quot;slash&quot; 
style to the &quot;pointed&quot; style bumper blades.  So, while there is no
&quot;official&quot; 
VW record of the change, I believe that a lot of us think it happened 
late in the '66 model year and some say it happened early in the 
'67 model year.

I hope that answers a few of the questions about Splitty Bus bumpers.  

Here is one more fun VW pick-up truck trivia tidbit:  on the 21st of Nov 
1960, as of chassis #684 866, &quot;the wooden slats on all pick-ups were 
now fastened with rivets, formerly with screws&quot;.  

Enjoy those Busses!
