Subject: List Charter and my thoughts on the list.

Thanks Stephen, for posting the charter,
I think it's good for everyone to be reminded occasionally
what our focus is.
I don't mind the ebay posts, but I don't read them, it gets annoying
when people post to complain about how &quot;outrageous&quot; ebay prices
are.
I like technical help, but when I need tech help I go to the archives
first,
and usually find an answer there. If I don't find them, or don't
understand the archives answers to my questions I'll post them to the
list.
What I really enjoy are posts about bus-related experiences, such as
trip reports,
someone who's getting a new bus or selling one, someone who has found
one or rescued a bus that's been sitting for a long time.
I have become a little concerned about the reports of sour business
dealings between people on the list. I think these things should be
settled privately, and I understand that in the past people have made
attempts to do this before taking their problems to the broader forum.
On the subject of unethical or unreliable vendors, I believe that the
list serves as a valuable resource; unfortunately there are vendors and
individuals who do not manage their businesses (or perhaps their lives)
as well as they should, and when one listee or several listees have been
affected, I think the rest of us should be notified.
I make my living in publishing and journalism, so I enjoy reading the
experiences of people who share an interest in the same things that I do
(namely air-cooled buses), Brian Wittling for example, and Jack Maynard
have posted some valuable and enjoyable messages regarding their
travels, as have many others.
One thing I would like to see more of on the list is humor; busses are a
passion that produces humorous situations and reactions as a natural
companion. I would like to hear more of the funny things that happen to
people and their VW's.
I get lots of emails each day, work and vw related and I always find
something that's important and enjoyable on this list. Sometimes I
provides me with the solution to a problem, sometimes it's just a
refreshing break from the pressure of the work day.
I'm sure a lot of you can relate to the value in being able to &quot;get away
for a couple of minutes&quot;.
I try to be a good correspondent for all of us, follow the rules, be
forgiving of others mistakes and remember the benefits we all share in
being able to communicate in a way that was unthinkable just a short
time ago.
But please....let's keep it as the charter mandates, all aircooled all
the time.
thanks for listening,
John Flowers
