&lt;&lt; As you all have read, I brought home my first split yesterday.  Drove 7 
hours and towed it back on a dolly in 30 mph winds.  P.O. promises me it ran 
great for him, but it has been sitting all winter.  I try to start it, it 
cranks &amp; cranks, but nothing.  I spray a little starting fluid in the carb 
and it starts and run for a few seconds before dying.  I repeat, same thing.  
Following Muir's instructions, I check the fuel pump (which looks new) by 
taking the fuel line off the carb and turning the engine over with a wrench.  
I do get some gas coming out of the line, but not much.  Do mechanical fuel 
pumps go bad when they sit for a few months??  Muir says take the screw off 
the top of the fuel pump to inspect screen, but my fuel pump has no screws or 
bolts on top that I can see??  Does this sound like a fuel pump?? Bad carb?? 
Any suggestions about he next diagnostic test I should try?  Thank you all 
for the responses to my previous inquiry, on eof these days I'm gonna know 
all ab!

so pour a little gas down the carbs throat- the plastic cap from a spray 
paint can is good for this use.  DOes it start and run for a bit, then die?   
pumping the gas dont help?  is there fuel in the fuel pump.  You can take the 
line from the pump off the carb, have a friend turn it over and watch for gas 
coming out.  If gas comes out, I would say the pump is okay, and if you are 
sure the carb has been getting gas, then take the carb and do a rebuild/clean 
it out.

some gas comes out, hand turning it the amount of gas does not look like 
much.   I would suspect gummy carb,  Take it off, find a oil drain pan, wipe 
it out, and take carb apart over the pan to keep all the bits together.
