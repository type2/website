Subject: Prepping for paint job questions

I'm going to prep my camper for a paint job.  I'm planning to have it 
sprayed at Maaco or Abra or a place like that.  Not show quality, but 
decent.

Anyway, there is a lot of surface rust where the original paint has 
either faded away, or has developed a network of fine cracks which are 
starting to get rusty.  There a couple of dozen chips on the nose which 
have started to rust.  There is one crease about 8&quot; long, maybe 1/8&quot; 
deep.  There is one small rust hole in a rocker.

I am planning to bondo the crease and the rust hole.  I am planning to 
give the rusty areas a good sanding, but I don't want to attempt to get 
those entire areas down to bare metal unless there is no other way.  I 
was thinking of some kind of rust converter (after the first sanding or 
wire wheeling) , then multiple coats of primer, sanding between coats, 
until I have a smooth surface.

Is my plan any good?

I'd really like some step by step advice on how to go about prepping 
this bus for paint.  If you recommend specific products (please do), 
please give the name brand and product name, and where it can be 
purchased.

Here are the auto supply stores I have here in Minnesota:

Auto Zone
Bumper to Bumper / Champion
Checker
Pep Boys
Wal*Mart
Menard's
Home Depot
K Mart
Ace Hardware

THANKS IN ADVANCE!
