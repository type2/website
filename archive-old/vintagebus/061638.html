Subject: Beetlemex stuff; VW of SA connection?

I've just spent some time poking around in the Btlmex_dot_com site, which raises some questions.

1.  Does anyone have any experience with Beetlemex's &quot;Brand new ¨Turn-Key¨ Complete Engine&quot;?  The engine appears to be carbureted, but the photo on their web page
&lt;  http://www.btlmex_dot_com/product.asp?0=201&amp;1=210&amp;3=34  &gt; 
is so poor that it's hard to tell.  It also appears to have a generator rather than an alternator, which seems odd for a VW of Mexico brand new production engine.  

2.  Among the various parts Beetlemex sells they list &quot;OEM Heaterboxes&quot;.  Does anyone have experience with these HEs?  The price [$45.25 each] is certainly attractive, but not if they're lighweight, poor quality junk...

3.  Beetlemex seems to function as a quasi-official connection for parts available from VW of Mexico.  Is there a company in the USA or South Africa that does something similar for parts available from VW of South Africa?

Inquiring minds, etc.....
