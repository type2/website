there is one point on which I disagree - she herself does not become insane-

it is more than the fellas who become &quot;freaked and generally miffed at the

world in general&quot; are the ones who become insane. ........     They

should get over it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------



Now, I would have to disagree with that one, at least on the basis of the

majority of cases. 

What I am talkin' here is not insanity in relation to busses or VW or any

other car matters, I'm just sayin that they can be quite insane in general

&quot;psycho bitch&quot; (pardon my French) type of ways.


.....different drum, but an entirely different band!  What I am pondering here
is

the quality of women who go insane AFTER their introduction in to busses.

okay, Brian, keep your story straight.     in your original post you said



Now, by insanity I don't mean stab you in the shower psycho stuff here, just

very subtle quirks and issues with the world that leaves a fella freaked and

generally miffed at the world in general.



now they  (we)  are psycho bitchs.    But  what I don't understand is why  you
say that like it's a bad thing.      

maybe you've come under  the influence of a woman who is into VWs herself, and
instead of making sense, you are babbling, dropping your wrenches, and
contradicting yourself.  Obviously that woman is friggin nuts.   Must be a
psycho bitch  when she said she'd rather tune up her bus this weekend and no,
you aren't invited.      Yes, it must have been the bus.  What a freak.
