I have an original westy rack FS, with brand new wood and hardware.
I figured I'd toss it out here before I put it on ebay.

It is not the correct rack for the 50's westies, and is not compatible
with the tent; tent gets to stay, rack gets the boot.

If anyone has a &quot;sloped&quot; early westy rack, I'm very interested.

I paid $525 for the rack and then added the new wood and hardware.
Also has the correct clamps.

Pix available electronically.
