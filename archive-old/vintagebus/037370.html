&lt;&lt; I have come across some left over VW parts counter reference manuals that
 were copied and found last PM.
 There are 5 copies of the '67 print...covering '58 thru '67, 8 copies of
 the '58 printing covering '54 thru'58 only.
 Interested in one of them?
 $40 includes S&amp;H for the '67 edition and $22 includes S&amp;H for the '58
 edition.

to everyone, these are great references.

However, the 58 covers all bus parts available at VW in 58, not just from 54. 
 Any parts for 53 and earlier would be referred to by the later nine digit 
part numbers, not the earlier style numbers.

the 67 edition would cover all parts avaiable when published, including 58 
and earlier, howver it would not be as good for the earlier buses as many 
parts had been superceded or NLA by 67.

At least, this is how all the parts list I have seen have been.
