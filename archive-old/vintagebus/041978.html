&gt; One thing I wonder about using a VW RGB on an airplane -- it's being

Actually, it would be a lot less.  The reduction boxes in a bus are fed
through a ~5:1 reduction in the ring gear, resulting in a 5-fold increase
in torque.  This ignores the transient stresses of dropping the clutch too
fast while accelerating.

 but I would think that a Bus would load
&gt; the RGB shafts a lot more in shear, since each one has to hold up
&gt; over a quarter of the weight of the Bus.

True.

  It wouldn't load them in
&gt; thrust much until you went around a corner.  On the airplane, if
&gt; the prop is balanced right, there shouldn't be much shear at all,
&gt; but there will be tons of thrust loading - the prop is pulling the
&gt; plane, right?

Yes, but the thrust loading maxes out at at two or three hundred pounds at
most, and is a nice steady force.  compare this to driving a bus across a
sidehill and you'll see that the thrust loading is similar.

The only spec that is greatly exeeded by this application is RPM.  I know
the bearings are good for these RPMs (similar bearings are used in
motorcycle engines) and as long as the gears remain happy everything
should hang together.
