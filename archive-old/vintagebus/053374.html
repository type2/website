Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] BBB weather in January

  It's a bummer they haven't updated there facts.  As of the last few years
our temps have been on an increase yearly with August being the hottest and
it seems like Febuary being the coldest. But hey, I can live without snow,
even though we have got it here before. We're hoping for high 60's and low
70's for BBB and lots of fire ringd sin the evenings.

It's nice in the daytime, but can get chilly at night!  Bring a jacket and
some blankets to sleep under!
