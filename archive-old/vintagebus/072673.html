Subject: Mini trip report, SoCal-Carson City, NV-SoCal

My father (91) had some health concerns so I took a quick trip up US 395
to help him out.

Left on Wednesday, May 21st at 7:00AM from Canyon Country, CA.  I was solo
on this trip, so no fooling around with restaurants or rest stops.  First
stop was in Mojave for gas and coffee.  Next stop was in Bishop for gas,
and I made it to Carson City at 3:00PM.  GPS said 411 miles and an average
of 53MPH while rolling.  Since I was going north and gaining altitude, the
temperatures stayed between 65 and 80 degrees for the entire trip.

Took care of business in Carson, and headed back on Tuesday the 27th at
9:00.  I was loaded with over 1000 pounds of engraving and radio gear, so
the four 7000-8000 foot passes along US 395 were slow affairs.  The bus
ran right up them in third gear, but since I was heading south the
outside temperatures rose rapidly from 75 at the start to 104 between
Mojave and Rosamond.  With the higher temperatures I took it easy and
climbed hills at about 3/4 throttle.  Stopped for gas in Topaz Lake NV,
Bishop, and Rosamond.  Had some minor crosswinds that cut my average down
to 51.5MPH on the return leg with arrival at about 6:00 PM.

Since I missed dropping some radios off for repair in Lancaster, I
backtracked there on Wednesday.  Temperature was 102 when I left Canyon
Country, and rose to 106 by the time I got to Lancaster, 35 miles later.
The temps dropped to a paltry 98 by the time I returned home.

Since this was the first real hot spell of the year, I saw lots of
overheated cars by the side of the road and a number of tires with thrown
treads.  My bus ran like it always does, slow but sure.

Total trip length 892 miles in three driving days.
