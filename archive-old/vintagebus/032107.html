Subject: Logo advice
To: ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Check out the link below...Im thinking of painting a logo on my singlecab.
Any suggestions???
Does it look stoopid?
Its paint so its not going to come off too easy.
Looking for a &quot;yeah&quot; or a &quot;neigh&quot; before i break out the vinyl cutter and the 
paint gun.
Any suggestions for the rear? Im thinking &quot;sales service 818-555-1212&quot; or 
something.
Thanks-greg
