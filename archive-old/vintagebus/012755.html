&gt; I'm just curios, where you live that you would need front
windshields to stop a
&gt; bullet.  Is your bus of the working force daily driver type where it
needs to
&gt; protect against pistol packing road rage Los Angeles psycho's or is
this the
&gt; official drive by bus for your gang of hoodlems.  Maybe it's just
me, but I'm
&gt; thinking you could come up with a less conspicuous and much faster
get a way
&gt; car.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, the thought of bullet proof windshields just made me laugh.

Well, when they make me President, my limo will be air-cooled.
Picture the secret-service agents standing up in the open sunroof
while I relax on the z-bed on my way to Air Force one!  At least my
guards won't have to jog alongside!

Seriously, you have to have over an inch thickness of Lexan before you
think of stopping a bullet, and even then it will stop only certain
bullets, like those from pistols.  A good deer deer load with a
solid-point bullet will go through most &quot;bulletproof&quot; glass.

Keep in mind that the bullets do not bounce off the Lexan.  They
penetrate and hopefully will be embedded in the Lexan.  You have to
replace the windows after every attack!  This could be kind of costly
in places like SoCal and NYC.  You also have to replace the windows
every two years or so as their bullet-resisting characteristics change
with age.

If you're thinking of adding this feature to your bus, don't forget
that you really must add a Kevlar blanket to the area below the
windows to catch bullets aimed lower than the glass  Run-flat tires
and armoring in the engine bay are also good ideas..

Figure on adding about 1000 pounds to your bus with this style of
armoring.  You'll need stiffer springs and perhaps mountain gear
reduction boxes to push that load around.  The mountain gear will also
come in handy for those slow-paced presidential parades.
