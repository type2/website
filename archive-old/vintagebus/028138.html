Holy chit.  Is this still the United States of America (and the internet) where
individual free speech is protected (in the US) and encouraged or not??  Don't
back down!  If you think the price is too much, that is your
opinion....regardless what others that have a HEAVY vested interest in making a
profit off of an event may think.  That is what this list is about at it's core
a free interchange of ideas and opinions.  Just make sure your up to firing off
flames to defend yourself and have a thick skin.

I'm on your side just for the record.
