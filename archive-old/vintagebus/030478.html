Well,

One of those &quot;warehouses&quot; is in Harbor City .....Not really huge, but it is the
starting point for the journey &quot;over there&quot;.  One of the mags did a article on
it last year I think.  I forget names.

&gt; OTOH - do we have proof that these cars actually *left*?  That would
&gt; be THE scam!  Maybe there's a huge warehouse in SoCal with all these
&gt; buses that supposedly went to Japan.  They could &quot;bring them back&quot;
&gt; onesy-twosey and make a killing and saving on the shipping costs!
