hey all..
while filling up the bus today I watched the gas like always...but this
time the gas was green.... and I was at the 87 octane regular unleaded
gas pump.  I thought nothing of it thinking that this was just winter
brew..
then about 30 miles later the bus runs like hell. just horrible.
wouldn't idle, popped, crackled, backfired a lot!, and had no
power...and jerked in the low rpms... I was getting ticked and was
accusing the carb.  I advanced my timing and off I went with a red
face.  Still running bad..but better...it got me home.
then while in the T2 chatroom tonight I mentioned it and someone said it
was diesel.. what damage will this cause and what can I do to the
offending gas station?

thanks
