Subject: tie rods shot...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10006271111390.77689-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

well,

after fixing my voltage regulator snafu yesterday i decided it was time to
adjust my link pins.

If you havent done this DO IT its very easy and will let you know the
condition of your front end.  Took me like 5 minutes per linkpin, i just
followed the muir procedure, easy as pie.  Shot the whole front end full
of grease too.

I found out they didnt really need adjustment as i adjusted them basically
to where they were when i got under there, but this told me my front end
is tight and low mileage :)

The other benefit of performing regular mantenance like this is that you
can get under there and look at stuff, see what needs taking care of.

I looked at my tie rods, that i _thought_ were nice and tight when i put
the front end in.  Turns out they were tight because the balls were rusted
beyond belief and over the last couple thousand miles, they have worn to
be quite loose!

So this has pretty much convinced me that new tie rods and draglink are in
order for all my future busses, or a very thorough inspection both at
installation and every oil change on used ones.  A used part that appears
good can go bad quickly. (unless you trailer your bus to and from shows,
then it doesnt really matter)

So i have decided that greasing my fornt end will occur every oil change,
that is easier to remeber than every other, and since new kingpins are
NLA, rebuilt expensive, it makes good sense to keep on top of things :)
(probably wont hurt to use that needle grease adapter to squirt a bit into
the tie rod boots at the same time...)

Also i have heard that the new link pin kits that are avaialble just dont
fit right, so in essence new link pins are NLA too, or at least ones worth
using anyhow.

Next thing on order is cleaning my oil control valves.  My oil light
flickers at idle sometimes and im unsure if its beacuse the oil pressure
sender is in the t3 cooler or i really have a pressure problem. using the
t3 cooler in an upright configuration puts the sender in a wierd location.

take care,

Steve
