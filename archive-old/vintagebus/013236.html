I forgot who posted the original, but my bus had the same symptom-cutting out
after cruising at normal speeds, but starting right back up using starter or
by popping in gear. 

My bus would idle fine, but would stall out as I coasted to a stop
light/intersection/etc...and once started was fine.  I just put in a newly
top-end rebuilt.  I installed a carb I picked up when scoring a worn engine. 
It started doing this at about 200 miles on the new engine.  I was about to
take of the carb and replace it with the one I had been using when I noticed
that the electromagnetic cutoff valve on the carb was loose.
