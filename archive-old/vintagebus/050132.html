Subject: Re: Bus Resource List and Weekly Stats

&gt;Seems to me that folks on eb_at_y who might not know of the type2 library, would
&gt;probably not be subscribers to any list.  What I mean is that list
&gt;subscribers are probably not your intended audience.

&gt;I don't have too much simpathy for eb_at_y folks who waste $10 since they are
&gt;eiter too lazy or ignorant to doo a through web search for information they
&gt;need.  Maybe they don't have a printer and just wanted to get the info to
&gt;take on the road...sure.

Actually we've now heard from two of the three people in question; both of
them realized immediately upon receiving the item that it was merely a
reprint of a web page in the type2_dot_com Library, and both of them demanded
refunds immediately from the seller. So it really was more a matter of a
vague auction description than ignorance or laziness in these cases. They
thought they were buying a &quot;real&quot; publication (i.e. one with a Library of
Congress number).

You're right that we can't reach everybody with a comprehensive resource
list but there really is no effort to even try anymore that I'm aware of,
in the lists or the ng either, and that seems like very poor service for
the VW community.

Your comments about our lack of good placement/complete description in
search engines are quite right. It is a vestige of the days when I didn't
WANT us to get a lot of hits from people who weren't list members because
we didn't have the resources to serve them all, so I deliberately left out
meta tags and such--we have the resources now so I will fix that.

Maybe I'll take out the scripts that deliberately sabotage web spiders too.
