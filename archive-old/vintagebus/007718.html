&gt; Erin, you forgot - distributor 180 degrees off, although then, you usually
&gt; get a backfire.

Ah yes JP - you are right on that one although when he says he wasn't
getting any spark, I kind of figured Rex &quot;had no spark&quot; but whatever means
he figured ths out.  A dizzy 180 out would give spark - just at the wrong
time and definitely would cause a backfire at least once or twice.
Good thinking though JP - glad you brought it up and I hope it helps Rex
track down his problem.
