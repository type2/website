&gt; Before the Porsche Pulley we used to have  to back off RPMs from 3,000 
&gt; engine RPM down as low as 2,800 RPM to keep oil  temp just below 220 F in 
&gt; weather 
&gt; in the low 90s F.  With the  Porsche Pulley we only twice got barely above 
&gt; 210 F _at_ 3,000 RPM twice  for just a few minutes each time.  Most of this 
&gt; part of 
&gt; the trip the oil temp was about 200 F.  This in the hours it  takes to do 
&gt; that route going North, with again outside temps in the lower  90s F.

Hey guys    Now that we have two different people (Tedebare, eric&amp;Barb)   
both giving the same results , with Tedebare even giving his head temp drop I 
would say it is safe to think that the porsche pulley is a good thing to do .  I 
would agree with most of us that it isnt a real good idea to remove the engine 
tin. If any of you have the split bus spec book  by david eccles  on page 61 
you will see what VW did for real hot driving which was to add a set of scoops 
that you could open when you wanted to  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
