Subject: RE: [VB] rough idle

Pete and Buck writ:
&quot;My question, could the carb on that side not be supplying the right mixture
of fuel and thereby making those two cylinders not fire correctly?? &quot;
That is exactly right.  The carbs are not tuned right.  Get a unison and
tune them for the same vacuum.  Also make sure that they are in good running
order, meaning are they new or recently rebuilt?  A lot of carbs I have
rebuilt have incredible amounts of crap built up in the thing basically
choking it out.
 
&quot;p.s. Should I expect to always be adjusting stuff with dual carbs on a
daily driver? If so, should I convert back to a single factory carb?&quot;
Dual carbs are fine if you keep them adjusted.  If you want ultra low
maintenance go with a single carb.  I have never tried a Weber progressive,
but they may be an option if you want more performance.  
Last weekend I ripped off my Webers 34ICTs in favor of the stock setup with
a 30-PICT-3 on a DP manifold.  Runs great with the stock setup, but then
again there is more power with the Webers...  Granted with the stock setup I
am running a vacuum dizzy which is heads and tails better than the 009.  You
can run a vacuum dizzy with Webers, but I did not bother with it.
On a positive note I was getting 23 MPG with the Webers :)  Hopefully I can
get 25+ with the stock setup...?

Good Luck,
