Subject: Re: Fuel pump

Chris, 

I don't think your original post said, but I'm assuming that the bus was
running prior to swapping the fuel pump. Based on this assumption, I say
don't pull the carb as Cal is suggesting... too much potential for more
problems to troubleshoot. Cal's suggestion of filling the carb to see if
it will run is valid. 

I pour about a thimble of gas straight down the carb throat, but I will
probably get flamed about the rich mixture washing the oil off my
cylinder walls, etc. (Not to mention potential for real flames if the
engine backfires through the carb!)

You can fill the float bowl via the vent tube... that brass thing that
angles into the center of the mouth of the carb above the choke. It
dumps straight into the float bowl. It's easy to get at in a Bug or
Ghia, in a Bus you may want to get some aquarium air tubing and a
syringe or funnel to direct the gas into the float. You don't need to
fill it all the way (maybe an ounce or two?).

Before all of this, though, I would check for fuel coming out of the
pump (as another listee suggested). First check is the fuel filter...
assuming it's between the pump and the carb. Second check would be to
pull the line going to the carb, direct it into a jar, and have someone
turn the engine over. You should get pretty good flow with every stroke
of the pump, otherwise you may have improper stroke (fuel pump push
rod?) or a bad pump (yes, even a new pump may be bad). 

Back to getting FLAMED, (literal sense), it's easy to get casual with
gasoline, but it's *extremely* flammable. If a spark or flame ignites
that gas in your test jar, or fumes from spilled gas, your likely
reaction will be to drop the jar and ignite the bus or yourself. I won't
belabor the point, but I figure it's worth mentioning.

BTW: What's a '67 Canterbury-Pitt anyway?

&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt;  Just open up the carb and fill the float bowl with gas, close it back up
&gt; and mount it , and try to start it. If it doesn't go then, then you may
&gt; have a clogged mian jet - which can happen if you don't filter your gas on
&gt; the way into the carb.
