Subject: FW: [VB] 1967 Bus Turn Signal Switch

Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

Just a note to say &quot;thanks&quot; for all the responses I received related to my
bus turn signal switch needs. As usual, Ronnie of Old Volks came through
with a very nice one like two days later.

Notwithstanding the above, here is an e-mail from a fellow bus list member
regarding 67 Bus switches you may find interisting. Seems that KG will be
repo-ing them next year. Good news for all who may need on now (or one for a
rainy day).

Sorry I missed Jerome! The WTC attack affected my attendance (I work for the
City of Palm Desert and had a big rally in the Park Sunday).

Hart -

I realize this is a few weeks after your original post, but I'm a city
worker (LA DWP) putting in way too much overtime.

A reproduction is in the works right now at KG Products in Ventura, CA (Its
a division of Karmann Ghia Parts &amp; Restoration - broadening their horizons
so to speak).  My buddy Jim there has said it will be available sometime
next year as they are prototyping it right now.  I know this doesn't help
you now, but if you have found another great!  If you've temporarily fixed
your existing switch, hang on until they've got it available.  KG just
introduced the the ultra-rare Bug 60-61 switch earlier this year - great
quality, looks just like the original.  They're making the 62-67 Bug &amp; Ghia
Turn Switches as well and the 68-70 &amp; 71 Only Bug/Ghia switches will be
available this winter.

You can reach Jim at jim96003_at_c-zone_dot_net and get on the waiting list if you
want with your name, address and phone.  He'll even send the FREE Karmann
Ghia Parts catalog too.

Just passin' the info along.......
