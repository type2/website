&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any idea what the bastard oil bath air cleaner looks like 
or 
 have any pictures?&gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
There has been some disscussion about this on the list.  Possibly some of the 
time the 36HP engine aircleaner was used on these.  The Bastard only type is 
kind of a between thisand the 40HP ones.  It clamps on it oil pod onto the 
the tube to the carb just like the later 40HP ones, but does not have the 
snout.  Instead it has slits in the lower part of the pod for air ingress.

&lt;&lt;Also, does anyone know what they are worth? I think I have one that I have 
been trying to sell for $20.  &gt;&gt;
$20-30.00 depending on used condition.  Even though they are rather hard to 
find there is not a huge demand for them.  Kind of like the 1949 only delux 
heater cables we have new!    Eric&amp;Barb
