DID i read that right!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thom's coming to the classic!
I guess VWHowards offer to pay your gas  1 way must have been the clincher,
or do you just want to park at Christmas Tree Island with 5 or more other
DD's.
Hope you come down a few days before so you can participate in all the Pre
Classic fun, after all it's only 55 dollars pre registration for a swap spot
&quot;ouch&quot;, I guess I'll try to sell out _at_ OCTO the day before, then I won't
have to worry about a swap spot at the Classic.
