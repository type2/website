I think if someone is smart enough to drive a VW then they should be
smart enough to know where to source their info.
Vintagebus listees shouldn't hold it against a fellow T2 driver just
because their bus is only a bay.
Essentially we are all Bussers and should enjoy sharing the list's
infinite wisdom.
I dont think it's a question of definite segregation, but merely use the
list that works best for you.

My $0.02,  Daniel
