Hey all,

I just put a 34 pict 3 on my 1600DP in my 66 deluxe hardtop.  The PO had put 
the 30/31 pict from the OE 1500SP on an adapter.  My bus sounds more mean 
now and much more throaty.   Anyway it takes a long time for the bus to 
return to idle after it has been reved to a higher rpm.  I put on the idle 
cam spring off the 30/31 which was stiffer but didn't notice any 
improvement. Muir said the 32 pict (i believe) ran in the early 70s took 3 
seconds to return to idle.  Is this normal behavior for a 34 pct 3?  If not 
what can I do to make the carb more reponsive.  I really don't like the carb 
not returning to idle between gear selections!

TIA,

Eric
