Subject: 36hp Muffler Tip with Later Style Bumpers?

List:

My '59 Westfalia was in the transition year where the 36hp motor was used (prior to the Bastard motor), but VW had changed from the pressed bumper to the more common later style slash bumper that was used from '59 to '65.  The 36hp muffler with the single muffler tip works fine with a pressed bumper, but will it work o.k. with the slash bumper?  I can only assume that the '59 transition year 36hp buses had the earlier single tip muffler, but does it require any kind of adapter or modification to clear the later slash bumper?

My motor should be ready to install within the week, so I haven't had a chance to actually mount the muffler and bumper.  I just would rather not have any surprises when I get to that point, so thought I would ask the question now.

TIA.

Robert
