Hey Bob,
    I was just talking to Dawn Smith of PLF this last weekend about
this.Last summer
I had a friend lend her an original &quot;flip seat&quot; sling and she promised to
make a pattern and then offer them for sale.Sha run into some rough times
but promised she could make them soon.If you bug her also then maybe she
will make both of us one.
Sorry but I don't have her new # or address. Anybody ?

-----------------------------------------------

The back of the front seat lifts up and tucks into
&gt; this hammock-like thingy which is suspended from a rod fitted into two
&gt; brackets above the doors. I have the brackets but never knew what they
&gt; were for. Now I am looking for a pattern/template for the (canvas?)
&gt; hammock/sling affair that holds the seat back. Anybody out there have a
&gt; pattern/template or know of somebody who makes this product?
&gt; Bob, in northern Calif.
