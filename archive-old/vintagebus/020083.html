Dr. Jacks bus is sitting at a Metro Detroit VW Recycler of low standing.I saw this bus all the time around the area as the doctor lived in an apartment above some storefronts in Downtown Royal Oak.

does anyone know what ever happened to david koresh's bus from waco? sure,
it was a bay window, but think of the cool factor of owning such an
infamous/famous bus.  it didn't burn in the fire, so i guess it could be
&quot;restored&quot; if it still exists.  also, what about kevorkian's bus--another
bay window.  did OJ have any vw's?  what about robert blake?
