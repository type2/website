The only frustrating thing that happened while working on the bus today 
was the fact that I can't get a bolt screwed in.  I put the package tray back
in today and swung the metal knee-banger back around underneat it.  And for
the life of me, I cannot figure out how to get the interior bolt in.  The
bolt in question goes behind the speedometer and in front of the package tray.
In a bus without a locking ignition you can just stick the bolt in from beneath
but there is a tapped hole in the casting for the ignition switch this bolt
needs to go in.  

Get the idea?  :-)

The steering doesn't lock reliably without this bolt to pull the switch up,
so I'd really like to get it in there.  If anybody has any ideas I'd love to
hear 'em.  I know there's some listees with these locks...

In case it somehow matters, it's a '67 Westy and the lock is the kind w/the
removable tumbler.
