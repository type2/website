    I will try there also. I am flying out today from San Jose.  So, I will 
not have my bus either! ;)   I think I will be wearing a white Volks 
Authority tee and very short hair.  
Can't wait to get there, it should be fun.  
    Michigan is home for me.  It is funny, I really do not remember seeing 
Split Windows growing up.  I only remember Vanagons.  This will be a blast!

See you there.
Susan
