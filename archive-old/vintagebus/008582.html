&gt;Can anyone tell me more about the NZ camper that was at BBB4?  Any other
&gt;pictures, owner info?  I'm very curious to learn more about what was
&gt;correct for that part of the world.
&gt;
There are some pics on my page, I believe the owner lives in Tucson, AZ.
I've talked to him a few times but didn't ask if he had email.  Nice guy,
eats weird NZ stuff, though.  :)
