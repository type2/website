&gt;I have a '59 panel and all of the wiring harness is brand new... 
&gt;My prob is that the front bullet turn signal doesn't work and the
&gt;bulb isn't burnt out. I can hear the flasher clicking for the rear
&gt;and the speedo light doesn't come on when i put the switch to the
&gt;left because of this problem...

First, you probably already know about this, but
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html
has lots of wiring diagrams.

If all the other bulbs work (right front, both rear) then I'd say
to start looking at the wiring for that right front bulb.  First
check the ground.  Get a test light (which can be a dome light
bulb and a couple of pieces of wire).  Connect one of the wires
to the bottom end of the far left fuse in your fuse box, and
ground the other wire to some bare metal - the light should light.
Leave the one wire connected to the fuse box, and take the other
one out the window and to the left front bullet turn signal.
Take the turn signal bulb out and touch the test light wire
to the round &quot;shell&quot; of the socket that contacts the brass
base of the bulb (i.e., not the part that contacts the solder
blob on the bottom of the bulb).  If the test light bulb
doesn't light up, you have a bad ground at the turn signal light.

If the test light does work, unhook the test light at both
ends and put the turn signal bulb back.  Go under the dash and
find connector on the wires coming out of the turn signal
switch.  Ground one of the test light wires and put the other
wire to the black/white stripe wire at the connector, and
flip the switch to &quot;left turn.&quot;  If the test light blinks,
then the black/white stripe wire is open between that
connector and the turn signal.  If it stays dark then
most likely your turn signal switch is not working.

A simple test you can do without a test light even is to swap
the black/white stripe and black/green stripe wires at the
connector.  If this makes your left front turn signal work and
your right front turn signal not work, the switch is the problem,
but if the left one still doesn't work, the problem is in the
wiring between the switch and the left front turn signal.

I think it's likely that when you get the problem with the
left front sorted out, you will find that the speedo light
probably works as well.  If not, let us know.
