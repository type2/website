My wife and I are going to the UK next month and I wonder if any listees 
over there might be able to point me in any VW places of interest that I 
could hopefully run into during our trip.
We are starting in London and going up as far as Scotland and then back down 
to Wales before flying back home from London. We head over there May 20th 
and will be there until June 4 or 5.

Cheers
