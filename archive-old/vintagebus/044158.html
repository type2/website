Well, it's done.  I completed my first paint job ever on my new '66 camper.  A word of thanks to all list members who offered encouragement and helpful tips when I was stressing out about doing it my self.  And to the ONE member who was very discouraging (&gt;&gt;you'll end up with a dull finish full of bugs, runs, and hair&lt;&lt;) well, we don't even have bugs in Ohio this time of year, so there!!  It actually came out pretty good, I'm very pleased.  See pix in the gallery on VW Planet web sire (49-67 Campers).



Peace, John Baker
