&gt;This is a good idea, and I'll try it if I'm ever 
&gt;foolish enough to remove
&gt;the alternator with the engine in place again!
&gt;
&gt;One caution is that you need to be careful to keep 
&gt;track of the washers
&gt;and shims on both sides of the fan.  If you drop one of 
&gt;these into the
&gt;shroud it will be a heck of a job getting it out!  
&gt;Still, with care it
&gt;would be a lot less disruptive than lifting the shroud.

  I had to change out the Generator in a parking lot in 
Biloxi Mississippi on our cross country trip (long story 
to follow): 
  I had installed an interior light above the engine, 
power wires had aligator clips to use as work light or 
static timing light...great idea until they dangled down 
and wrapped around the pulley shredding the fan belt and 
making a mess in the process. Happened at night, BFE 
Kansas. I was changing out the fan belt when a semi 
doing 80 blew by only a few feet away sending shims into 
the tall grass everywhere. At the time I didn't realize 
that I needed ALL of them and apparently the nut ran out 
of threads before it had tightened the pulley 
adequately. Dusted that pulley by Oklahoma and wallowed 
out the keyway on the generator shaft by Biloxi.
  It took me prolly 5-6 hours to change it, curious DEEP 
southerners asking questions the whole time and HUGE 
mesquitos eating me alive (looked like I had smallpox or 
something all the way to Long Island). Yes, I dropped 
those washers a couple times, luckily they stayed within 
the squirrel cage! 
  I was soo beat by the time we finished, we splurged 
and stayed in a fancy RV camp. We parked in back against 
the fence and Lisa made a nice dinner, I reclined in the 
comfy chair next to the fence with my fried chicken and 
glass of wine, ahhhh. BBBRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPP!!!!! MY GOD 
I nearly jumped out of my skin! Chicken and whine go 
everywhere as a FREIGHT TRAIN zooms by on just the other 
side of the fence (and continue throughout the night)!
  I hope yours goes more smoothly. I had to share since 
changing that generator out was probably the longest 
(and funniest, looking back) VW day of my life!
