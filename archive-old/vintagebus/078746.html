Subject: OEM Parts catalogs...

Hi all,

I'm going thru some VW stuff stored down in the basement and I'm trying to
identify the applications of some new Brazilian &quot;Fania&quot; brand accelerator,
clutch and heater cables that I found.  The VW part numbers and/or
applications aren't on many of the labels, but the Fania part numbers are.
So, does anyone out there have a catalog or a listing of Fania cable part
numbers and their VW applications handy in their VW literature collections?
Same goes for info on German &quot;FAG&quot; bearings.  I can't make sense of the FAG
bearing numbers (only some of the boxes show a VW part number with the FAG
number).  Do you think there might be part number and application info on any
web sites out there? Thanks for any help or direction you can provide!
