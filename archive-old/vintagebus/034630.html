&lt;&lt; The biggest problem I have right now is with the front end suspension.
 The bus drives and steers just fine. New shocks. The suspension just
 doesn't move. The drivers side is up against the rubber stop and the
 passenger side is about 3/4 inch off in the compressed direction. I have
 pumped a lot of grease into the fittings. All of them have acceppted the
 grease easily and following the advice of Mr Hoovers lately demised
 sermons I pumped until I got clean grease. I have applied a reasonable
 amount of downward pressure using a jack with the wheel suspended. I
 have also driven it for several hundered VERY bumpy miles.I suspect that
 if that doesn't break it free nothing will. What I'm looking for are
 simple solutions that require no money and little work 8) Seriously now,
 Is there any way to isolate what the hang up is without tearing the
 front end completely apart and losing the use of the bus for weeks. My
 Bently manual shows LOTS of tools I don't have in order to do most of
 the work. That scares me. Can I take the torsion arms off the springs
 without disassembling the entire front end. I figure that might be a way
 to tell which end of the system is binding. &gt;&gt;
Hi Terry,
Yes you can fix everything in about a day and a half easily.  Our best guess
is that your torsion bars are broken (and/or the torsion bar bearing are
bad.), so you need to find a set from both the top and bottom tubes from a
wrecked bus.  Remove the wheels, the allen bolts holding the swing arms on and
pull the outer suspension off each side.  When you pull the bars out mark them
for which tube and which end.  Taking them out will give you a idea of how to
dissassemble your bus and install the new bars. Plus make sure to look for any
cracked pieces of the bars, if cracked start looking for other buses to get
whole bars from or mix and match if nessary.  We would suggest installing the
bars turned around from the way they came out of the old front suspension
(Leftside becoming rightside.) so they are given a different stress pattern
and should last longer than the other way which has already been prestressed.
