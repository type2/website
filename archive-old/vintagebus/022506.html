If you check out the newsgroup: rec.travel.europe, there is an outfit
that posts to that newsgroup regularly about renting VW campers.  As I
remember, the prices are very reasonable.

&gt;Hi,

&gt;Does anyone have any information about renting a westfalia (late model or
&gt;vanagon) in Paris? I
&gt;want to rent one this summer to get to a wedding in Prague. Sorry for the
&gt;borderline bus content. I promise to stop and help any broken down busses,
&gt;but that goes without saying.
