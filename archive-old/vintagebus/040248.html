Hi People,

This is Eren Berberoglu from Turkey , I bought my first split 3 months ago , 
it is a 1967 single cab . I have had many VWs before (type1type2,type3,type 
4) recently I have a 66 beetle also , I was in vanagon (t3) list before I 
had to sell it , I was busless for one month than I found this SingleCab and 
bought it for 500$ . (uploaded a picture to vintagebus_dot_com)
It is rusty , I installed a balljoint front-end from a 68 ,it fit directly 
,can there be anything wrong with this conversion ? After repairing the body 
my future plans are converting to IRS and building a bit more powerfull 
engine to make it more fun .
I will ask more help when I start working on it.
