Hi Andrew,
Well if the engine is setup correctly (Carburator jets to match the air
cleaner, muffler, and engine compartment.) and the stock tin and warm air
system to the carburator is in place.  We find that here in the rainy cold NW
of USA in less than two blocks that our engine is warm and not stalling at
the stops without the choke working.  You can use the automatic choke, but
really need to adjust it off when the weather gets to staying above 70F
during the spring/summer.
