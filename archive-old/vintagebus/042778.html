&gt; any one have any idea about this vw tool  ?
&gt; what is it?
well,

If i had to guess (and i do because i have no idea what it is) i would
guess this:

It is a fixture for attaching a case half to a mill so that one can
surface the inboard sides of the case... it looks to be missing 1 wing nut
and 1 steel bar...

how it would be used.... (a wild ass guess) bolt the tool to the mill bed
with the wingnut side up.  then attach the case to the tool with wingnuts
and flat stock. Mill the case joining line flat.  Repeat on other half of
case, then line bore mains and cam back to standard.

VW used to do this on all rebuilt engines until they decided it was more
work, had worse results, and overall cost more than a new case!

take care,

Steve &quot;guesser&quot; white
