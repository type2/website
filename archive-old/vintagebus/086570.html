Subject: Re: [T2] Refinishing Aluminum Wheels

Ted,

I did a set of wheels last year(or maybe the year before).

Actually did a refurbish on them.  &quot;Mother's polish&quot;, lots of &quot;elbow 
grease&quot;.  The ones I refurbished took quite a bit more than that, so I 
ended up starting with wet 500 grit sandpaper and worked my way up to 2000 
grit and then used the polish...mounted them on one hub at ran the engine 
ad idle in first gear to make the job faster.


I also understand from another list the the things called &quot;magic eraser&quot; 
work quite spectacularly on wheels.  You can get them at wally world.
I haven't had a chance to try them yet.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey Volks- anyone have any advice on re-finishing aluminum wheels. The
&gt; wheels are in good shape, except for an accumulation of caked on brake
&gt; dust and discoloration under the wheel weights. As always, TIA Ted
