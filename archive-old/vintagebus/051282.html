&gt; I haev a bunch of pregnant friends lately and I've come to the conclusion
&gt; that parents should not be allowed to name their own kids. ;)

i completely agree.  my niece has the dumbest name.  so scott, when you get in the family way, are you going to let us/the list name your offspring?

cheers,
