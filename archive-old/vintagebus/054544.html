Subject: I definatly have a problem...

Yeh, I brought another one home again. This one is a '67 hardtop 
Deluxe. Craig K in Austin bought it a city police auction there and 
has had it for a little while. Things are changing there for him and 
he needed to clear it out. After some months, I finally gave in and 
went and got it. I drove down on Saturday in my personal VW Aircooled 
Search &amp; Rescue Vehicle rig (http://www.type2guy_dot_com/suburban.gif). I 
loaded it up and headed back home all without event. I met some folks 
at the gas station stops as usual and talked VW bus stories with 'em. 
One guy I met says he used to work for SCAT and is moving out to 
where Ronnie is in Arizona.

The bus is your average beater bus. Ugly green, missing stuff, rough 
around the edges, dented up nose, hacked wheel wells...you get the 
idea. I don't know what the plans will end up being for this, but it 
won't be much more than slapping an engine in and driving it. I put 
pictures up. http://www.type2guy_dot_com/67/
