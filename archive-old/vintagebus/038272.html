One of the two hinges on my engine lid (61 deluxe) has torn out of 
the sheet metal.  Luckily, the hinge is larger than the top slot of 
the lid so it kinda hangs in there and works somewhat.  There are 
four splits in my town and I notice that the 63 23 window has the 
same problem.....Its gotta be a common problem.   Has anyone 
sucessfully repaired a torn out hinge?   Obviously its a weld job,  
but not sure what and where to weld to.  Or, should I replace?  
Anyone have a decent  rear engine lid for a 61 for sale?
