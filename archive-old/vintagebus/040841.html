On another vehicle list I am on this very discussion came up.
Being a bunch of seriously diehard motorheads, they discussed
it ad nauseum.  The conclusion is that some decades ago, some
engine builders deliberately left their cases outside to
weather for a while before doing the final machining.

Don't know what difference if would be for magnesium as opposed
to whatever version of iron they used, but it made the cases
more stable &amp; less prone to distortion as a result of the machining.

Jeff  no bus &amp; really slow on the digest
****************************************
I have a question regarding the use of a &quot;weathered&quot; engine case.  I have
an engine case that has never been line bored or damaged in any way, but it
sat out in the rain and sun for 20 years.  Upon disassembly, it really looks
to be in good shape.  Would all that &quot;weathering&quot; weaken the case
somehow?  I guess this is sort of an offshoot of the &quot;engine fire&quot; case
discussion...
