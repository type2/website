Dave Easterwood has a 79 double door Kombi that was setup partially from the factory for Electric power.It was a TVA(Tennessee Valley Authority)vehicle.From the factory mods include a 4speed locked in third,no shifter or clutch pedal,extra frame reinforcements,louvers on the lower portion of the side doors and many things I have forgotten since seeing it a few years ago.It was delivered to the TVA and the elictrics were installed I think.

 It is a very intresting vehicle that Dave wants to get back on the road.It will be very intresting when he does with the mods he talked about.

Ted

&gt;My friend wants to make his single cab battery powered .....
&gt;20-30 miles range would be OK

From what I have seen, 100 miles or so is doable with an overnight
charge.  You might be able to quick-charge for a few hours and get
maybe half of that.

The basic parts of the system are the batteries, the motor, the
controller, and the charger.  Sometimes the controller and the
charger are in the same box.  Most of these are self-explanatory
except for the controller - it lives between the batteries and
the motor and does things like connect to your throttle cable
so it knows how fast you want to go, connect to the brake lights
so it knows when to stop powering the motor, and so on.

&gt;anyone know a website that he can go to for electric car info?

Hot VWs had a big article a few years back about two different electric
kits for VWs.  I would say sometime in the 1993-1995 time frame.  You
can probably get a back issue from them.

Home Power magazine is mostly about alternative power for your house
(solar, wind, etc) but you can probably find some links to electric
car info.  http://www.homepower_dot_com/

The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association has a solar/electric/
hybrid/etc vehicle competition, the Tour de Sol, yearly.  The link
to this year's competition is http://www.nesea_dot_org/transportation/tour01.html .
In 2000, there was a solar-electric bay-window Bus built by fourth
through eighth graders at Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vermont.
http://216.157.9.207/nonprofit/riverside/ .

The program for the 2000 Tour de Sol has an ad for an electric-vehicle
magazine, &quot;Electrifying Times&quot;.  http://www.electrifyingtimes_dot_com/

If you're more into rolling your own, Solectria http://www.solectria_dot_com/
is one source of suitable motors, controllers, and chargers.  I have
been volunteering with the University of Tulsa's hybrid electric
vehicle team (Hurricane Motorworks) and they use Solectria motors and
controllers on some of their cars.  http://www.hev.utulsa_dot_edu/

Punching &quot;electric vehicles&quot; into Yahoo! reveals several more likely
candidates.

I hope this helps!
