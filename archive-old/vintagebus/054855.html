Subject: Different Rack

&gt; I just bought a 66 Deluxe hardtop and it has what looks like a factory
rack,
&gt; but I have never seen one like this.  Take a look at
&gt;
http://communities.msn_dot_com/1966DeluxeBus/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;Photo
&gt; ID=11 and let me know if you have ever seen one like this.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; John
