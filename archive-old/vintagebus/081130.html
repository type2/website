Subject: Upper &quot;Roof&quot; Windows-

Group-

I saw a picture of a panel van with those upper &quot;roof&quot; windows like the 21
window buses.  Was this bus ever made this way or did the owner put these in?
Is the roof sheet metal formed special for these windows?
How hard is it to &quot;butter&quot; these little windows in?



Thank you very much,
