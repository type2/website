Subject: Re: [VB] safari windows

Ahh, the annual spring Safari window thread! 


I've mentioned it before, but here it is again...




The trunk seal from 80-90's Volvo sedans is a good replacement for Safari window 
to body seals. The profile is &quot;UD&quot; with the D being a hollow crush seal and the 
U having a rubber encased steel channel that holds the opening lip well. Trim 
the U at the brackets for a better fit. If you need a firmer crush, feed weather 
stripping or rope through the D with a coat hanger or spare accelerator cable. 
It looks pretty good from the inside. Cheap too. 




If you can't get to a salvage yard, let me know and I'll send you some for a 
donation to the Type2 fund.
