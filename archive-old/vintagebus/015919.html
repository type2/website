Hi everybody,  I purchased 2 new windshields and rubber for my 65 and it
still leaks.  Is there a secret?  Should I use some sort of glue?  Also I
think the rubber doesnt fit in the opening very well as you can see where
the previous one was and the new one is about a quarter inch off.  Havent
had any luck with my question about the wood cabinet for the inside door 
of 65 Sundial.  Any chance of getting the measurements from someone who
has something similar so I can make one?  I will drive my 65 over my 86
any day even if it does leak.........   Jon in San Diego         PS  I
purchased the items from Wolfsberg West
