&lt;&lt; We just saw pix of Scott's Binz at one of the Talla. VW club meetings
 recently.  Very cool!   &gt;&gt;

This one cam out of Texas.  I had it in my registry already.  I don't know 
much about the other two in FL.  Would appreciate help getting in contact 
with the owners so we can share information.

Also depending on who you talk to there were between 700 - 900 Binz crew cabs 
made putting the production numbers about the same as the Hebmueller.  Well, 
in my little registry the highest numbered Binz I have found is 205 and the 
VIN says it was made late in the '58 model year.  Given this I'm having 
problems believing the 700 - 900 number as VW started making their version of 
the crew cab in the '59 model year.  If I am right on thinking the production 
was less than previously believed this make the Binz even rarer than the 
Heb!!  

Would appreciate ANY leads on other Binz crew cabs and/or owners and/or 
previous owners so I can fill out the registry.

Thanks,
Dan
