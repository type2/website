Subject: re:progress report

was writ:
&quot;I replaced the transmission mounts for the second time in 2 months, this
time with urethane mounts, what a pain.&quot;

any idea why you went through two sets so quickly? i thought i read on the
list that the urethane mounts were not a good idea in a bus. i don't
remember exactly why-something to do with them being too stiff.

please give an update in the near future after driving with thme-if you
notice any difference.

thanks
