I have spent the last six years as an HF Radio operator in the U.S. Air
Force.  After spending all that time wondering why the heck we are doing
what we are doing I cross-trained into Air Force Intelligence (oxymoron I
know).  Presently I am a Current Intelligence Analysts stationed at
Vandenberg AFB.  As a sideline I maintain the VOSH (Volunteer Optometrist
Servicing Humanity) websight http://www.vosh-florida_dot_org/ for free.

It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.
