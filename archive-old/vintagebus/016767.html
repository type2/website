Hey y'all
Didn't see one yet on the lists so here goes.  Took the Burrito Express from 
Charleston to Asheville.  We (the family, dogs &amp; I) left sometime between 
9&amp;10 am.  Took the usual side/backroad (176) to Columbia then jumped on 26 
for the rest of the run to the exit.  Stopped for gas once, mileage 
calculated out as 24 mpg!  The Express likes backroad steady cruising.  The 
highway hogging was uneventful though we had to go down to 3rd gear on a 
couple grades.  All that camping gear :-(

Got there about 3:30, checked in with no real problem, and set up camp.  
There was some folks from Seattle checking in at the same time.  We spoke 
with them even though they drove a Vanagon (no snobbery here!).  Later check 
ins were given a hassle by the rangers.  On checkin, I was given a cheesy 
map with a whole page of Rules and Regulations printed in tiny font on the 
back.  I told the ranger lady it'd take me all weekend to read it.  I was 
also given a comment card ;-)

Still working on the unpatented tarp-o-matic setup deal, this time using 
unsuspecting trees for part of the rig.  They didn't mind much I think.  We 
were visited early on by Marv Krupp, who lives nearby.  After setup, we 
walked about to see the glorious arrival of bus after bus, smiling happy 
faces after surviving the later shift of rangers who were reportedly not 
real friendly.  They got over it real fast once Busma kicked in and we 
started talking busses and unrelated things.

Once dark set in, we ended up at our site, maybe 9 folks hanging out doing 
the fellowship of the bus thing.  We were graced with the arrival of Mr. 
Ranger, who snuck up on us, not once, not twice, but 3 times.  Marv reported 
the next day that Mr Ranger was hiding in the bushes spying on us, no doubt 
waiting for us to conduct arcane ceremonies and rituals involving goats and 
chickens and the waving of sharp objects.  Had we known we would have been 
glad to oblige, perhaps using Mr Ranger in lieu of a chicken.

Next day we woke up to the promise of rain but that was ok.  We were camping 
and expected it.  Walks around the campground, talking with friends old and 
new.  learned about the intricacies of VW locks from Snoopy.  Fixed the 
lighter in his lantern.  Chris Cybulski and Stella arrived in the Westfakia. 
  Helped with lunch cooked by the lovely Joy, vegetarian Indian food.  
Outstanding!  Assisted with cleanup, talked some more.  After a bit, 
digestion mode went to nap mode, which sounded like a real good idea.  Off 
to the Express for a nap.  Got elbowed in the ribs more than once for 
snoring so I didn't get lots of sleep.  That's a good thing, because I heard 
the sound of (that's right) a bus pulling into the site.  It was Doc Ric, 
who shared the site with us.  After more conversation, we made a salad and 
gathered our supplies for the spaghetti dinner.

Grabbing a tarp and stuff, we headed up to set up and help with dinner. 
Dinner was, as usual tasty and plentiful, with fine cuisne, Marv's homemade 
wine, and door prizes.  I won a cool D sticker, the kids did well, and my 
lovely wife Sherry won a model of a 'vert bug.  I didn't offer any broke 
parts for a door prize 'cause I hadn't broken any on the trip up.  Mr Ranger 
came by and made people move their busses, eyed us strangely, perhaps 
looking for human remains in the dinner pots or something.  Door prizes 
distributed, dinner cleaned, folks headed up to the campfire for the 
ritualistic sacrifice of the holy engine case.  A half case reportedly did 
us proud, spectacularly exploding and shining it's holy light upon the rapt 
faces of the crowd.  I was lugging all the stuff back to the campsite and 
missed that part.  Stepped on the puppy too, and he voiced his displeasure 
quite loudly.  Ric was already there, so we lit a fire and conversed.  Off 
to bed a bit later to practice my snoring.

Woke up to my wife snoring.  Went and took a shower.  Put the shower back.  
Got in trouble for not making the coffee before I went to shower.  We packed 
the bus, took down the unpatented tarp-o-matic.  Ric decided to cook 
breakfast.  Home grown eggs, veggies, cheese.  Mmmmmmm.  Shortly after, 
cleanup done, I managed to break the strap holding the Dormobile top.  
Improvised with a motorcycle tie down I 'just happened' to have.  The 
Express grumbled to life, bid Ric adieu, and did the tour de campsite waving 
goodbye to the wonderful folk of the Full Moon Bus Club (shameless plug).  
Dropped off my filled out camper comment card at the gate, requested another 
(in case the first one doesn't get sent to the proper folks.  Blank copies 
available upon request)

Did the backroad run all the way back.  191/176 down the hill.  I was 
lamenting the fact that I was operating the wrong vehicle for that part of 
the road.  Would have been much more fun on 1 of the BMW bikes.  Still, was 
a real pretty drive, managed to slow a lot of folks and let (made?) them 
enjoy the scenery.

Stopped for fuel, 22.6 mpg from the flatlands w of Columbia, up to the 
campout, and down the hills again.  Boring 2 lane drive.  Into a 
thunderstorm and stuck throttle at 4000 rpm.  The cause is the pedal 
assembly under the floor.  Lube time and maybe ought to reinstall the belly 
pan.  Cell phoned Pizza Hut delivery.  Didn't order Anchovie and Jalapeno 
pizza because the family doesn't like it.  Made it home, unpacked the 
Express in record time.  Dinner arrived, hung out for a while and off to 
bed.

The camera shat the batteries immediately upon arrival so no pix.

See ya at High Country Bus Fest
