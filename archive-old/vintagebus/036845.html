was writ:

 After the rained stopped I went back for future inspection.  
These are my findings:
Motor starts and runs   BUT  If you accelerate the motor shakes more then I 
think it should,  and lots more than it ever has.
No oil being thrown, or smoke from the exhaust.  ( I hope that is a plus in 
my favor)
Plugs are all oil free, and performance did not improve after cleaning
Retarded and advanced timing and no improvement.
The shake isn't a misfire kinda thing but almost seems to be in a horizontal 
direction.

I was planning to take the motor out this summer to detail it and replace the 
intake but after this I am not for sure what to do first.  My first thought 
is to take it out, strip it down, and take it to a VW guy to look at.  But 
can he tell anything without tearing it down to see if anything is broken 
inside?  Should I pull it to him so he can hear it running before I pull the 
motor?  Do I pull it and take it to him still together so he can run it on 
his test stand?
Is there anythgin else I can do to diagnose the problem?

 no, dont drive on it.   

 you could  make sure it is running on all 4 .  pull one wire of dist cap at 
a time (with a rag, or it may shock you, amusing animals, small children, and 
your friends), motor should slow the same amount for each, if it slows and 
hesitates badly on 3 of them, no difference on the other, youre running on 3 
cylinders, which could be a bad plug wire, or a bad valve, or whatever.    if 
so, check your plug wires are good and on tight and not cracked or hardened, 
and attached to the right plugs (remember 1-4-3-2).   (once I was glad I had 
extra plug wires in my bug, as suddenly it ran like crud, and I pulled off 
the freeway, finding it was running on 2 1/2 cylinders, checked the plug 
wires, ran much better after replacing a couple of them)    If that doesn't 
help do a compression check. 

  some little bird in my ear says the FW  nut could be coming loose, so you 
could check that.   It would have excessive endplay if the nut came loose and 
the FW was doing the shimmy shimmy shake.   Check end play   pull/push crank 
pulley   -  a thunky thunky is too much.   should move a hair.

  or is it a  tranny mount gone?   broken .   do you have a split case tranny 
or a tunnel type?  if a later one is in there, pull the fan housing towards 
you.  a broken tunnel type front tranny mount will let it tip back and pivot. 
  and shake around.    it would also have made the shifting funky.     

doesn't sound oh so bad.    just rambling here.
