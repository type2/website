I saw a VW proto type diesel at the Porsche museum in Stuttgart Germany.  It
was the nicest car they had there :-)It looked just like a regular bug
except it had a button on the dash for warming the glow plugs.

for whoever it wa that was looking for such:

http://www.blueridgediesel_dot_com/deutz.htm
4/5/6/v8/v10/v12 variations, 45-499hp

http://www.indiamart_dot_com/bsa/diesel.html
5-10hp models.


Also:
&quot;Here are the links for the diesel motorcycle. I have been in contact with
Horst Beckedorf who imports these bikes from India to Germany and here is
what he said, &quot;The motorcycles are new- I just received 38 Enfield from
India. The top speed of the Indian version 325ccm is about 85 km/h. We
replace the engine by a stronger Lombardini Diesel engine from Italy with
435ccm and 10hp. The top speed is about 105 km/h. We use the 4-speed
gearbox
but with an 18 tooth sprocked instead of the 16 tooth sprocked from the
325ccm engine. The gearbox is right hand shifting first gear up.&quot; He has
offered to get some to the US, and has been grilling me on the emissions
law
and other technical/legislative topics which I am not able to field.
Anyone
with this kind of expertise is encouraged to write him.

 Enjoy. Be sure and run the sound files on Beckedorf's site. The
motorcycle
is a single cylinder and has a very distinct sound.
&quot;


have fun.
