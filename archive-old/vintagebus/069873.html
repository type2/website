&gt; Using the gutter I have found that front to back on each side is pretty much

Yeah, I use the gutters, and go with it. You want an angular differential
of 20 degrees between the frame, which is the horizontal reference of a
new fresh bus, and the hand-lifted (to take out slack) spring plate. This
sets up the proper tension/torque/angle in a new bus. Depending on the
condition (literally the molecular as well as macroscopic conditions) of
your torsion bars, the angle may or may not need fine tuning. Don't fold
over your locking plates to secure the reduction gear box bolts or
tighten up your lug nuts or axle nuts until you are satisfied with the
leveling on both sides.

When you are completely finished, then BE SURE to tighten and torque your
axle nuts, AND your wheel lug nuts.

&gt; I am chasing every thread to before replacing them.  I have been quite lucky
&gt; with some of my bolts compared to friends buses - though I think by having
&gt; good quality tools it helps.

There yah go - you'll be fine, and yes, good tools last forever, and get
the work done properly and efficiently, without damaging valuable parts,
or injuring valuable body parts.

&gt; Can't wait to get it rolling again

Just remember to tighten those axle nuts and lug nuts before test driving
it, and also bend over the locking tabs at your RGB bolts. If you don't
have those, make two thin steel strips, one with three holes, one with
two, with squared corners that can be bent up to secure each bolts.
Confused? Email me.
