Subject: The 66 is back onna road...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.4.05L.9812131233410.20208-100000_at_polaris.digital-galaxy_dot_net&gt;


Saturday morning, after going out to moms bus, and trying to rig hers
enough toget it home, I ended up giving up, and started working on the 66.

before I pulled the engien, I did a coompression check..125 on 1, 140 on
2, 0 on 3, and 140 on 4...Hmmm says I.

Pulled that orginal engine, and swapped it all over to this unknown H case
long block I've had sitting in the corner...I've had the heads off this
block, everything looked ok there...

Unbolted the tranny from the U, and from the front.  Pried and pried and
pried till it moved far enough to get the new coupler between the rod and
the selector shaft...Much fun.  But at least I didnt have to unbolt the
redux boxes...Though I haveta say I'd expected more front-to-rear movement
in the axles..guess not.  COuldnt get it far enough to chance the front
mount.  Oh well (the one there is OK, but since I had it apart, and I have
a new one on the shelf...)

Put the &quot;new&quot; engine in, and it took forever to start....mostly cause of
the oil I put in the cylinders...:)

Eventually started.  I'm about to readjust the clutch, (oh, yeah, the
longblock DID have a 6volt flywheel..:) and take it for a test run...after
putting air in the right rear tire, of course..

Still dunno whats up with Ichigo..*sigh*
