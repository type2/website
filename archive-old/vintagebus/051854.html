&gt;
&gt;  I took a close look at Thom's picture of his hitch's tag and ran it
&gt;through a translator. Apperantly it's an &quot;appendix device&quot;
&gt;(Anhangevorrichtung) not a hitch!  8^)

While an Anhangevorrichtung may well be an &quot;appendix device&quot;, that's
not what Thom has.  It's an Anh=E4ngevorrichtung, which Babelfish translate=
s
as &quot;towing bracket&quot;.  Those funny little marks are important!  Some of
the online translators provide &quot;pop up&quot; foreign keyboards.  Or, you=20
can use the following translations (at least on Babelfish):

Funny capital B (Beta) - type two 's'
gro=DF -&gt; gross

Vowel with two dots over it (umlaut or diaeresis) - type the normal vowel=
=20
  and follow it with an 'e'
St=FCckliste -&gt; Stueckliste

So, Thom's hitch tag reads:
(ORIS logo)  Anh=E4ngevorrichtung  1000 S u. 1004
Hersteller: Srobach, D=F6rge u. Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Typ: Oris D 28  Pr=FCfz.: (caterpillar) M 3349  Baujahr: 1964
Zul=E4ssiges Gesamtgewicht d. Kfz.: 1100 kg
Gepr=FCft f=FCr 600 Kg Anh=E4ngelast
F=FCr Kraftfahrzeuge gem=E4=DF bes. Anbauanweisung
Vertrieb: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart

Punching this into babelfish.altavista_dot_com with the above substitutions
yields:
(ORIS logo)  towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and CO, oHG, Stuttgart
type: Oris D 28  Pruefz.: (caterpillar) M 3349  year of construction: 1964
admissible total weight d. Kfz.: 1100 kg
checked for 600 kg of trailer weight
for motor vehicles in accordance with bes. Cultivation statement
selling: Petrol Riehle, Stuttgart=20

And I would clean this up to:
(ORIS logo)  Towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
Manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Type: Oris D 28  Test mark: (caterpillar) M 3349  Built: 1964
Admissible total weight of vehicle: 1100 kg
Tested for 600 kg of trailer weight
For motor vehicles in accordance with installation instructions
Seller: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart=20

Line by line:
&gt;(ORIS logo)  Towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
Pretty simple.  I'm not sure what the numbers refer to, though.
=20
&gt;Manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Again, pretty simple.  oHG is _probably_ an abbreviation for
the name of a village/neighborhood around Stuttgart, but it
could also be something like &quot;incorporated&quot;.

&gt;Type: Oris D 28  Test mark: (caterpillar) M 3349  Built: 1964
The model number, certification, and build date.  That &quot;caterpillar&quot;
sign is an older EU acceptance mark - kind of like the encircled E
you will see on the light lenses on new cars.  A similar marking on
a U.S. part might be &quot;DOT&quot; or &quot;Meets FMVSS&quot;.
 =20
&gt;Admissible total weight of vehicle: 1100 kg
I think this means &quot;not to be installed on vehicles heavier than this.&quot;
It _could_ also mean &quot;total weight of vehicle and trailer.&quot;  I am
assuming that the Kfz. means &quot;Kraftfahrzug&quot; or &quot;motor vehicle&quot;.

&gt;Tested for 600 kg of trailer weight
Here's the trailer weight, a little over 1300 pounds as you noted.

&gt;For motor vehicles in accordance with installation instructions
The &quot;installation instructions&quot; is the part of this translation I'm
least happy with.  It could instead say something like &quot;applicable
regulations&quot;.  The &quot;statement&quot; part makes some sense but &quot;Anbau&quot;,
which Babelfish translates as &quot;cultivation&quot; has me stumped.=20

&gt;Seller: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart
And this is the place that sold it.

I used these two online sources:=20
Babelfish     http://babelfish.altavista_dot_com/
EuroDicAutom  http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/login.jsp

I haven't had any formal classes in German.  All of this comes from
online translators, studying German phrase books and a couple of German
VW books, and hanging out around my sister who has a degree in German.

&lt;disclaimer&gt;
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not an expert in German and that
towing something with your Bus is a potentially dangerous activity,
so you have to decide for yourself what kind of hitch you need and
how safe it is.=20
&lt;/disclaimer&gt;

I hope this helps!

Matt Roberds
