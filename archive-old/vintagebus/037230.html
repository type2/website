&lt;&lt; 1. How did they know what my bid was?  My maximum bid was 5 dollars
 higher than the current high bid.  The winning bid was only one dollar
 higher than my maximum bid.  Aren't all bids sealed till the close of an
 auction?

Steve, they didnt know what your bid was.  They just bid at the very last
second and hoped to out bid you.  Apparently they did, but we'll never know by
how much.  eBay will only list the high bid as the one that beat you.  So if
you bid $75 and they bid $80, their high bid will still only be listed as $76
(assuming the bid went up in $1 increments)  Even if they'd bid $5000 it'd
only show their high bid as being $76
 
 2. Was it just luck that they submitted a bid and hit it with only a few
 seconds left on the auction?  It seems to me that either someone was
 VERY lucky or they have a way of setting up a routine that automatically
 bids one increment higher at the last second of an auction.  Is this
 possible?

There are programs that will alert you of auctions that are ending so they can
sneak in at the last minute and outbid people.  This may or may have not been
the case in your situation.  The luck was that they picked an amount that was
higher than your high bid.  If they really bid that late in the auction they
probably only bid once and got lucky.  Lots of times they will start with 10
minutes left and keep bidding $1 higher until they outbid you.  I dont think
there's programs that automatically bid for people becasue they really have no
idea what yout high bid was.  They just got lucky that they outbid you.  If
they hadnt outbid you with that one bid, you would have won if there were only
3 seconds left.
 
 Curiously, I wrote to customer service and asked.  This is what they
 said:
 
 &quot;What may have occurred, is while your screen was updating, the other
 user placed a bid in the last seconds of the auction. This is what is
 referred to as &quot;sniping&quot;, a practice that, although perfectly within the
 
 rules of eBay, is discouraged as a bidding strategy.
 
 &quot;Sniping&quot; is the practice of waiting until the last few minutes or
 seconds of an eBay auction and outbidding the current winner. Most
 bidders, who are used to more traditional auctions where the gavel only
 falls when there are no more bids, feel very annoyed and frustrated by
 it.
 
 There is no real tips or tricks to avoid being sniped --just good old
 fashion common sense of bidding the maximum you feel comfortable with.
 We continuously encourage bidders to make proper use of the proxy
 bidding system that is in place, and to bid the absolute maximum they
 are willing to pay for an item right from the start. This way, even if a
 
 bidder is outbid, they will not pay more than they are willing to, or
 can afford.
 
 The time it takes to redraw your screen or to bid on an item can vary so
 
 much, depending on the computer you use, the modem and the internet
 traffic and the time you bid. (If you bid during a prime time, it can
 move pretty slow sometimes.)&quot;
 
 Is this correct???  Thanks for any insight!

This is absolutely correct Steve.  It is cheap and very annoying when people
do this and I call people that &quot;snip&quot; me every 3/4/5/6 letter name in the book
if it's something I really want (I dont send them e-mail, but I yell at the
wall and stuff).  But if you technically followed eBay's recommendations you
shouldnt feel too bad because what you bid was really the maximum you'd
consider paying for whatever it was.  One way I've found to save a little $ is
to wait until the end.  If you bid early in the auction, you're more than
likely to be outbid at the end, but if you wait you can sometimes save some
$$, but you have to keep on top of the auctions, most people do wait until the
very last minute.  I know from my ebay selling that some of my auctions have
sat bidless until the last 15 minutes of the auction only to have 6-8 bids
come at the very end.  All I can suggest is wait until the last half hour of
the auction and then bid the very max you'd pay for the item and dont sweat it
if you do get outbid.  

&gt;From a buyer's prospective I think it'd be better if eBay didnt show what the
current bid was on an item and kept everything hidden until the end.  That way
if you bid your $75 and someone else bid only $74, they couldnt see that it
wasnt enough and then bid a few $'s more until they outbid you. I cant tell
you how many times I've said &quot;ok, just $5 more&quot; and then gone on to say that 4
or 5 more times.  Once you get into the habit of bidding your max amount from
the very start you wont get as annoyed when you're sniped.
