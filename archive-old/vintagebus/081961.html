&gt; Good to hear you fixed your problem.  In our opinion if one has the
&gt; use sealant between the pump and cover there is something  seriously
&gt; wrong.  

In my case it was the long bolt, that I discovered after putting a new
gasket w/ a light smear of sealant, but I sure wasn't going to take apart
the pump again just to remove sealant ;)

&gt; Plus we do not like using sealant there because if  too much
&gt; is used any excess can clog up an oil passage.  One  should use
&gt; studs not bolts for the reason you found. Also studs can easily be
&gt; threaded in fully for the most strength and be left in so as not to
&gt; wear  out the soft aluminum/magnesium alloy threads in the stock
&gt; engine  case by threading in and out over and over.

I agree except for one major factor in this install. The pump cover
has recessed areas where the fastners go. There is not room for the
normal oil pump nuts to go. Allen head fastners are called for in this
instance. Either way if I had paid more attention to this I most
likely would not have had any problems.
