Joel,
Sounds like your gauge/sender aren't too accurate.  You can get a
mechanical gauge and put in the sender location to check it out.  What I
do on my test stand is run a tee at the sender and run a line from the
sender  to the gauge from the tee.  I think you could put it directly in
though if you get a 1/8 NPT gauge.  I have found that the mechanical
gauges tend to be more accurate, but not too useful in the long run on a
VW.  Anyway I haven't had too many VWs that idle 20-30 PSI hot.  You don't
have aftermarket springs in your relief/bypass valves do you?
