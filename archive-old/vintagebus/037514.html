  I had one of those 'bolt to the bench' models and it didn't work well with 
weight on it. I also do most of my stuff by myself. I have a heck of a time 
picking up motors by myself as I am nowhere near looking like a WWF performer. 
  My dad I built me an engine stand that will bolt to the engine while the 
engine is still on my floor jack. I can then jack up the engine and the mount 
will move up the stand. I then tight up 4 bolts and it stays put. I can also 
rotate the engine. It works pretty decent but an extra hand is still sometimes 
helpful.
  I can take a picture and stick on my website if anyone is interested.
