Importance: Normal
Subject: Ron out Tues-Sat

Just a note to say that email sent to my PERSONAL addresses may go
unanswered from Tuesday thru Saturday, as I will be on vacation.  For the
first time in a while, this one's purely for fun, with no business mixed in.
For four whole days I will not be driving a bus, thinking about a bus, or
selling parts for a bus, but instead will be playing in the waves and sand
with my wife and our three-year-old daughter Haley.  Wow!!

Of course it's business as usual at the Depot.  And all email sent to our
general address -   sales_at_busdepot_dot_com -   will continue to be answered by
Jerry.  Also the shop will know where to reach me in case anything that
needs my immediate attention.  But if you email me directly after tomorrow,
don't be surprised if it takes me several days to reply  (if I ever come
back, that is  :-).
