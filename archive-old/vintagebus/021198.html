Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator/generator replacement, torquing the fan nut.

There was some concern about whether one could properly torque the type 1
fan nut with the engine in place.  To be honest, I just tightened it until
it felt &quot;tight&quot;, so today I decided to make sure that the torque was
right.

I took my &quot;click&quot; style torque wrench, dialed in 44 ft-lbs and put the
36mm socket on it.  Took the air cleaner off of the the bus and put the
wrench on the fan nut with the handle pointing to the left side of the bus
near the top of the engine bay.  I put a scrap piece of plywood between
the handle and the sound insulation to prevent the torque wrench handle
from punching a hole in the fiberboard,

I then put a 19mm socket on a ratchet and put it in the pulley nut.  I
torqued the nut clockwise.  The pulley turned about 1/8 turn before the
torque wrench clicked, so the fan nut was a bit undertorqued.  In any
case, the nut is torqued correctly now.

This wasn't all that hard to do.  The torque wrench was long enough to
hold itself and the actual twisting was being done at the pulley, which
is easy.  Just don't forget to pull the torque wrench out before starting
the bus!
