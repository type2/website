&gt;hello all,  i have a 1967 splittie and all of a sudden i cant find any
&gt;gears and when i do i am putting so much pressure into it that it
&gt;really scares me.  I am replacing my nosecone transmission mount, it
&gt;had a stripped bolt on one side, and was wondering if that was what
&gt;the problem was or if there is something more that needs to be
&gt;done?????  if there is anyone out there with helpful information i
&gt;would love to hear it.  Thanks for your time.   peace   mark, tampa FL


Mark, if your front mount is broken, that makes the shift coupler act as
your front mount. It doesn't like it much either. The weight of the tranny
plus driving torque can make it very hard to shift. Can toast the shift
coupling, too, and probably has. I would replace both of them, definitely.
Might be more to it, but those are the minimum.

on a bus here- all the tranny mounts were bad.  The tipping of the tranny
mangled the shift coupler.  It also broke the shift holder guide thing under
the floor of the bus (65) That loop the shift rod goes through was broken.
Meant pulling the motor, had to undo the RGBs from the spring plates, pulling
the trans back a couple inches to do the front mount (though people have
sworn you dont need to, it seemed necceessarry at the time ), and replacing
the rear mounts as well.   and the coupler.   Took an hour heating up and
quenching the bolt holding the front and rear shift linkages togther and
successfully took them apart to install the replacing shift guide/holder and
put a new bushing in there while it was apart.  Drives much better now.

Replace your mounts ASAP is they are broken and coupler as well so hopefuly
the shift holder/guide does not die as well.     It is very easy to break the
connecting bolts (usually w/ 8mm square heads) off, and then it is more
difficult to undo.   the collar is soft metal, drilling the bolt will likely
destroy that needed part= difficult to find but crucial.

with broken mounts I could hold the engine and rock it forward and back.
tipsy motor.
