Subject: Metal Practice


I am practicing metal work on another car in anticipation of work on my 
15-Window.  What is the best tool/method for cutting body metal cleanly for 
later grafting onto another vehicle?  Air powered Diecutting tool?  
Reciprocating saw with metal cutting blade?  Grinder with cutter?  Other?  
Thanks.
