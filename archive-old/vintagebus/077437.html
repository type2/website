Subject: RE: 6V battery questions

Thanks for the great battery info... I went to my FLAPS and they hooked my
battery up to their charger over night. The next day I went to pick it up,
we put it on the tester, and go the same response as before trying to
recharge-&quot;battery good, charge low&quot; This makes it appear as though the
battery can not be charged, or is not taking a charge...

I decided to go with the aut*z*ne battery yesterday-it was only $32. it is
right around the corner from me, so replacement if necessary should be easy.
They do not carry the Optima, and refused to order one for me, telling me
that I would need to order through a magazine...I think if I have to go
through that much trouble to get one, and they cost about 4 times as much,
it isn't worth it. Plus how would I deal with a replacement  should there be
a problem...I will probably call optima on Monday and tell them how my FLAPS
responded when I tried to order one of their batteries...considering they
have this huge poster declaring they now carry Optima Batteries...

The interstate battery I had was only rated at 550CA and 440 CCA. To get any
help for replacement I need to drive much further away...they have not been
very helpful over the phone...or on my last trip there to get it replaced
last winter. If time appears to drive out to the interstate place, I will
make the trip...

The new battery doesn't quite fit under the battery strap, not sure what I
am going to do to secure...maybe a clip could extend the battery strap...

-My starter should be up to spec, I just replaced it last year
-I won't through wrenches-the charger was set to 6V

Is it possible that jumpstarting my car with a 12V battery would cause
damage to it? I have used those battery pack things on my battery...


Thanks
