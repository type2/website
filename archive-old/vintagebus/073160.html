Subject: Re: [VB] Re:lockplates for RGB bolts

Up to mid 64, they used the lock plates, which are,
and have been for a long time, an NLA part. And VW
makes it expressedly clear NOT to re-use the locktabs,
kinda like not to re-use the front spindle locktabs.
After that it was spring washers, I don't think split
lock washers. I have seen split lock washers used, but
they looked like they were purchased at a hardware
store, and not a VW or dealer installed item (too
thick, not correct i.d, etc). The updated service
installation was for spring washers.
According to Bentley, 63-67, sec H-2, page 3:
&quot;From Chassis No. 1197853, the lock plate-Part No. 211
513 535 for the spring plate securing screws was
replaced by a spring washer-Part No. N12 232 1. The
washer can be used on all Transporters when carrying
out repairs. The lock plate will be discontinued as a
spare part.&quot;
Another thing to consider is the reality that the
currently produced (and for some time now) bolts that
are available for this application (12 X 1.5 X 25 
grade 10.9) have a 19mm head size, and not a 17mm like
earlier bolts. If you use a locktab on the current
bolts, because the diameter of the head of the bolt is
larger, there really isn't enough &quot;meat&quot; on the
locktab to do much to secure it on the side of the
head of the bolt. You are MUCH better off using a
spring washer with the current bolts, which you should
replace anyway, especially if the old ones are messed
up. And get the correct grade bolts if possible.
Although I have never had trouble with the 8.8 grade
bolts, I think next time I do this job I'll definitely
get 10.9, mostly for peace of mind.

&gt; the online  parts lists

  No

&gt; &lt;&lt;  have a question though. When I took out my
&gt; trans, the bolts that held the
&gt;  RGB's on did not have any lock washers or lock
&gt; plates. I had a bus a long
&gt;  time ago and it had lock plates that the bolts went
&gt; through and the corners
&gt;  of the lock plates bent up at the corners flush at
&gt; one side of 3 of the RGB
&gt;  bolts on each side. The bent corner locked the bolt
&gt; in place so it would not
&gt;  back out. Does anyone have these on their bus? I
&gt; haven't been able to find
&gt;  them in any of the usual places. &gt;&gt;
