Subject: Re: [VB] That ballsy rattle!

Well, I ran the engine without the fan belt, and the sound is still there.
But other rattles and tinny sounds went away, but that's to be expected.
The sound has changed a bit from last weekend. No longer sounding like a
ratlle-can ball, but now more of a whistle, at the lower 2000's. Strange.
I went under there, and checked the exhaust fittings while it was on
briefly, and one seems to be leaky, so hopefully this next weekend, I can
schedule time to pull the ol' engine and pull off the exhaust stuff, and
check all gaskets. Also would like to get the rear end up on blocks and
check rear bearing play, and tranny main shaft bearing play. Your basic
end of winter engine TLC day. Endplay, etc. All the good stuff. Maybe even
yet another valve check - easier outside the bus.

Stay tuned, and thanks for all the responses and ideas!

&gt; Cal Could be rod bearings as you say. I would isolate fan by removing fan
&gt; belt. Then start engine to see if sound goes away. If not, then at least you
&gt; know it is inside. Then try to see if something is loose in rocker assembly.
&gt; Look for metal in the oil screen.

&gt; &gt; The first thing comes to mind is loose connecting rod bearings and such.
&gt; &gt; What's the consensus on this?
