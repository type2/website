Subject: Re: [VB] '71 gas tank will not fit in '67 body

Heh Heh - it ain't an easy fit - that's for sure.  Remove the fuel nipple
and make sure you have your wires ran for the sending unit ahead of time.  I
also hooked up a piece of tubing to the vent to I could run it to a vent of
my choice later on.

This is no joke - when I first tried to fit the 71 tank in the 66, I
couldn't believe that people actually did this mod.  I actually ended up
positioning the gas tank where I wanted it, sat on my rear with my feet on
the tank, and WHAM - it popped in.  Then I had to remove it.  That is even
more fun.  I can do it without the use of a rope and winch (just grab it on
either side and yank real real hard) by now though. :-)

Even more fun is tightening up the bolts for the extended straps.  I used a
bander tool from work and the straps off of the 71 junkyard bus and just
crimped it on.  The beauty of this is that with only minimal damage
inflicted on the original bands, you can take the banding clamp off with
vise-grips and put in a splittie tank later on if you want.  The original
bands will still be intact.
