&gt; But I believe he will need a 2.0 crank AND 2.0 rods to use 2.0 p + c's? ?
&gt; The dimension from the center of the wrist pin to the top of the piston is
&gt; different between a 1.8 and a 2.0 or I drank too much beer......


Well it appears that as for the fit of the 2L P/C's in a T4 case - that's a
go - no machining work required there.  BUT since this Porsche engine is an
1800 (very few 2L ones ended up in Porsche's)

Can anyone elaborate on the situation concering putting larger jugs on a
1.8L to make it a 2.0?  I thought the only difference was strictly a
displacement issue.

I think I'll go do some research.
