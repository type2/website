Okay Volks - here's the latest.  As you've noticed I've been keeping you
posted throughout the day.  It's not too terribly hot out but just enough
that I gotta come in a cool down occasionally.  Since I just got done with
supper, I thought I'd update you all before I head back out to the shop.

I've got the upper and lower cylinder tin fitted.  I'm replacing all of the
slotted screws with 10mm hex head bolts.  I prefer these because with
caution, you can tighten them down a heck of a lot more.  Vibration tends to
work the slotted screws loose so I've decided to switch over.  So far I'm
pleased with how snug I'm getting the tin to fit.

Next item was the conversion to J-tubes.  After looking things over, I found
me a piece of galvanized gutter apron that was scrap left over from the
roofing job on our house 3 years ago.  I know with experience that welding
any glavanized stuff is difficult and dangerous but it's all I had.  I
removed the dusting of cheapo paint with a wire wheel in the drill.  Next I
test fitted the j-tubes and took some measurements.  Then I ran down to the
lumber yard to use the sheetmetal brake to bend a 1/2&quot; lip.  After returning
home, I clamped the gutter apron on each j-tube with several vise-grips and
then removed the tube again.  Using the bench vise to hold the tube, I was
able to spot weld the gutter apron to the j-tube.  With test fitting and
more trimming, I've got a nice integral piece of block-off tin that bolts to
the lower tin for support.  I painted it BBQ Grill black and the pair are
both drying out in the shop in front of the squirrel cage fan.  The only
thing I can think of that might be bad about this is that the heat from the
jtube can propgate through the lower tin into the oil sump area and
elsewhere but I think since the contact with the block is minimal, the
amount of head that can be transmitted would be minute at best.

Back to the shop!
