&lt;&lt; also, does anybody know of a good solution to
 replacing a dormobile roof window seal? i tried the
 &quot;cutting-a-late-rear-window-to-size&quot; approach. the
 outer groove is too wide. i pretty much need something
 that's equal on both sides one side for the glass and
 one side for the fiberglass. here's a diagram of what
 i'm thinking of:
  &gt;&gt;
 Our approach in our old 70 dormer was to take it to a glass shop who was 
able to match it up with the correct grooved rubber. Due to the flat spots on 
the roof where the windows sit though they did go ahead and caulk the seems 
all around. this worked very well and only occasionally seeped when it really 
rained hard. The whole cost of the job was only about 75.00 or so and was 
well worth me not having to search for the rubber and hope it would work 
after installing it.
