What are the differances between deluxe and standard middle and rear
seats.  I know the rear seat has the luggage bar.  Do both get the kick
panels, does the middle on both get the grab rail.  Any other things
that go with one or the other?  This is for a 65 Samba.

The only differnce is that the back of the rear seat has  the metal bar on it.
Everything 65 came with salt and pepper (mesh grey) interior.   You can use
the middle and bottom of the rear seat from a 66 or 67 standard.  Both
standards and deluxes had the trim panels on the rea and middle seats.

But you don't want the seats from a commercial vehicle.  Well, the frames are
the same, I mean the upholstery is different.   Passenger vans had pleated
seats, and commercials did not have pleats.    Good original.  salt and pepper
seat covers are extremely hard to find, though.
