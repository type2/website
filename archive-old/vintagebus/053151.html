Subject: Re: [VB] pre 59 turn sig. switch colour question

If its the same as a '57 standard (which Im almost positive it is) then it
should be black.  I had the same question when I owned my '57 standard
when I was trying to decide if it was a standard or a kombi.

&gt; Should the turn signal switch on my 57 deluxe be black or white? I had thought white even though mine was black, but a friend has an og  58 that has a black switch housing as well. the difference being that his knob is white while mine is black. trying to get it as close to original as possible.
