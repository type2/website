Subject: How long should it take

  Yesterday I recieved 3 Dealer suggested repair time books for VW's. One of
them is from 1960. Here are a couple time quotes from the book.


0 M 18h  Eliminate oil leak at crankshaft pulley. (clean breather pipe,
install valve covers with breathers if necessary)         80 time units  5
units equals 3 minutes.

2 AB 16c  Replace complete front panel (cut out or straighten damaged parts,
weld in new parts and smooth out; remove and install front bumper and
brackets, both headlights, windshield wiper bracket and motor, electrical
wiring, both doors, both windshields, mirror and front panal as necessary
2300 units (23 hours)
  So VW would pay their body man 23 hours in labor to R/R a front clip. At
todays average shop rate of 50 dollars that would be 1150 dollars labor.

These are great guides and gives times on everything from bondoing a bumper
to cleaning an engine to replaceing rubber.

ps. I will try to photocopy these books and get them posted on the doc
project
