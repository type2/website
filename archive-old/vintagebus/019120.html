Find some neoprene cement, like used for wetsuit repairs, in black, of course.
Works like a champ, and stays flexible enough not to rip when you bend it
later in life.

A new shift boot is just a few $ at any of the mail order houses - go wild,
spoil yourself!

&gt; Anyone have a good suggestion of repairing a small tear in a rubber floor

&gt; Also, if this type of thing is repairable, could the same techniques be used
&gt; on an old shift boot?
