Subject: New engine

Hi all,

I have been watching this board for a few months with high interest. I
have a 65 splitty that (according to the VIN) probably started life as a
panel. She's a daily driver that I'm slowly resurrecting.

I want to put a new engine in, but am unsure exactly what. I want to
eventually be able to cruise at highway speeds, but also pull a small
tent trailer. I can get a turn-key engine from GEX that will generate
120 horses, but I'm wondering if that isn't overkill!? With the gearing
the bus has now, it just seems like I'll get to 60 mph really fast and
then what? :) I do a little work myself but mostly farm stuff out.

I am not a purist, though I will keep the bus fairly stock. Any
suggestions appreciated.

Jason
