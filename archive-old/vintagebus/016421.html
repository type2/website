Hello volks,

Is anyone out there from utah/colorado/wyoming/idaho area going to go the 
sacramento bug-o-rama this weekend and would be willing to pick some stuff 
up for me?  i am located in salt lake, and Greg Banfill has a front 
passenger side door I would like to get from him, and save some $$ on 
shipping.  It is the door only, no window frame.

TIA

Mike Anderson
