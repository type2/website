you see them when you remove the main seal- they are right against the 
crankshaft/thrut bearing there.  When the FW is back on, they are between the 
FW and crank.   

I have seen them mushed- do think they take some thrust.

They are mentioned in the Idiot Book.

If you  look at a VW parts list they are there-  in the pic for the 105 
section.   (crank, FW, rods, section.)
................................

back to the end-play shims....i think i understand where they should go.I
don't remember ever having seen them when taking my engine out(removing clutch
flywheel etc...) what are the side effects of running an engine without these
shims? is that possible, or would the engine not run at all? i'm wondering if
i just missed seeing them in my engine, or they aren't there at all and i am
causing engine damage with all my driving...

thanks

ps i have yet to see these end play shims in any of my exploded parts diagrams
that i have looked at.
