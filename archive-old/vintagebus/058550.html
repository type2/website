&gt; As far as the green webbing straps that were discussed (like tom is using),
&gt; Every og literature that I have on my site and that I have seen, shows very
&gt; dark (green?, Dark brown?) webbing straps. If you look on my site, the 6
&gt; 1959 and newer adds with canvas all have *definitely* darker webbing straps
&gt; ( some color, some B&amp;W) , whereas the 1 pre-59 add I have *appears* to have
&gt; tan. Perhaps it was a changed in 59 to darker straps, since that was the
&gt; most &quot;used&quot; aspect  of the canvas and it was easily dirtied.
&gt; I know of one 58 SC bought from the original owner with the og tilt, and It
&gt; had tan straps that matched the canvas. So the change must've happened
&gt; after that (if there was one). Oer maybe there were multiple suppliers?
&gt; I have never seen an og canvas in person that had anything besides tan
&gt; webbing straps.

 The og canvas and hoops that I borrowed from Paul Reeves to make what at
the time was going to be hoops and canvas for myself, were from his 65 DC.
The canvas had green salvage stiching, grey vinyl trim around the front gate
latch hole &amp; window, and what looked like natural tan canvas straps.
However, when you looked at the back of the straps where they had been
shaded from the sun &amp; weather, the straps appeared to be dark green.  In an
effort to be more correct, I matched that color on the straps.  I am glad to
learn that earlier canvases had other colors.

In any event, I can supply canvases w/ whatever color straps, etc. are
appropriate for the year specified.
