Subject: our '65, '77  Westy
Mime-Version: 1.0

I guess our driving is different, since we have two campers, and spend as
much time as possible off paved roads. If oyu ever drive in the woods, on
the beach, across your grass, in snow, do consider 27x8.5-LT14 light truck
radials. quite a few companies make them, you can air them down for extra
traction, and it really makes a diffence. Our '77 westy has over 300k miles
on the beast, and before we finally came upon these tires, I can't tell yo
uthe number of times we  had to be pulled out of soft soil, slippery grass,
sand, snow...since then not once.  And they work great on our '65 Westy.
Maybe if all you do is pavement travel, they aren't the tire of choice, but
I wouldn't be riding on anything else.  Jim
