Hi Chet,
Sounds like ti need more fuel to keep the idle going then.

&lt;&gt;
When you turn the idle mixture screw all the way in that turns the mixture 
lean, and since the engine only idles when teh choke is giving it more fuel 
this is not going to help.

&lt;&lt; The machanic who rebuilt the carb has been working with VW's for quite 
some time, and I was recommended to him because of this.  Didn't have this 
problem before the rebuild though. If it is the wrong carb jetting, how could 
I tell and is this likely to happen when getting rebuilt?  &gt;&gt;
Could easily be that the carb need to be cleaned again (Assuming he did when 
rebuilding it.) which is not unusual to have to clean a carb two and even 
tree times to get out all the old gunk.  Also could be the wrong size jets.  
You need to look at the stock tech info on simular sized engines for your bus 
to find possibly close jetting sizes unless you are running a completely 
correct stock engine for your year VW.  Then the jet sizes should be right on 
or very close.  Above all to really know what size jets you do have you need 
to get a jet sizing tool which is alot like a feeler gauge but has round 
sizing pieces instead of flat.  Eric&amp;Barb
