&lt;&lt;your bus' actual shift points depends on it's gearing.    In most VWs I am
in
4th by 35 mph.   My 61 gets 3000 rpms at 38mph, which is actually quite high
geared, and sometimes it is 40mph when I go to 4th.   Do NOT asume that your
bus has that gearing.   My 59 truck seems to want to shift into 4th just over
30mph, it is geared much lower.     If I took it to 40 in 3rd it'd complain
like anything. &gt;&gt;

OK, now we are talking,  as I mentioned in a previous post, I had the trans in
my '64 (1500cc) replaced with a rebuilt (stock gearing), and am now shifting
into 4th at around 35 mph, thinking something was strange.  My previous trans
seemed to be geared a bit taller, however the shift marks on my speedo matched
up almost exactly with the old one.  In addition, I have the feeling that my
speedo is off somewhat anyway.  My wife followed me home after purchase and
the bus indicated 50-55 mph, she says it was more like 45-50 mph on her
speedo.  I think my bus has stock diameter tires (14&quot;?), so...I actually
thought about exchanging the trans for another with higher gears, but if this
is normal (I mostly drive it to work, 35-45mph anyway)  I won't bother.  This
is my first bus after three bugs, so I'm still getting used to the
differences.

Thanks to all,
