Well, thanks to Clara and Eric and Barb for recommending i change my
transmission oil.  Wow, was that stuff cruddy.  I had quite a bit of
trouble finding a 17 mm allen wrench, so i sort of fashoned one out of a
10 mm bolt, the bolt head was a little too much smaller than the 17mm,
but the nuts that I screwed onto the bolt fit into those plugs perfectly
with almost no chance of stripping.  I still think tho that I should
look at my rear bearings.  But when i did the push pull test i really
dont think that there was any play in those rear wheels at all.  hmmmm -
it is kinda hard being sure of what you hear when you are  driving the
shell of a bus.  There is still a howl, but, ......

If your rear axle is not wiggling around, don't worry about your bearings.
Believe me, there is plenty else to tinker with.  best leave it.

if the oil was really cruddy, drive it around a couple hundred miles and
change the oil *again*.  (center section and RGBoxes of course, right after
driving so all is warm and stirred up).  Do find a 17mm allen wrench, or the
socket version.   I have seen allen wrenchs at FLAPS as they are used on bugs
and so there is demand.   I use the slick 50 tranny oil (after flushing the
cruddy stuff out with as many changes as needed)  it costs a bit more, but
does seem to make the tranny quieter (indicate less wear).   I guess I am
anal as I like to change my tranny oil every year.   I also tend to drive
dirt roads (no lowered buses for me).   My 61 m130 deluxe has a whine in 4th
between about 45-55 mph.  Todd Hill (who I took for a demo drive) thinks it's
a bad main bearing.  My choice is.... drive it more  with a whine or fix it
now.   Well,  we'll see what happens.   Also, after my 61 was parked for 6
months (winter storage) the tranny was noisy for a few hundred miles.   It is
better now it has been driven.   You may find yours will quiet down a bit,
and have whines or growls at certain speeds.   What does this mean?  you have
an old bus and the tranny has wear.  What do you do?  Well I put 22K on my
bus with a tranny whine.   Sometime it will get fixed I suppose.

Well, my current problem is a certain stiffness in the clutch cable.  I
spoke to a guy today and he told me that the clutch cable housing can
deteriorate inside and that you can be left with the cable riding on the
bare steel of the cable housing and that this can lead to clutch cable
breakage.  Is this all true?  My clutch does seem to work fine but for
this sort of grabbing.  Is replacing the cable housing a common
necessity?

GREASE is your friend.   Have you greased your front suspension?   Okay, jack
up the bus with a floor kack on the front torsion beam and pump new grease
through all the grease nipples till it squelches out clean grease.   Get all
of them on eack steering knuckle.   Collect the old grease in a yogurt
container or whatever.  smear some on the moving pedal parts under the bus
and where the brake cables move- all that stuff.

you may try squirting wd 40 or oil down the clutch cable housing.    Or pull
the clutch cable, blow the housing out with compressed air if handy, grease
the cable thoughroughly and reinstall.  Replace the cable if it looks
marginal (frayed).

I use a little of adjustable wrench to undo the wingnut if it is sticky.
wire brush and grease the threads before putting the wingnut back on the
clutch cable.

Then again some clutches are stiffer than others.   Yours may be normal.
