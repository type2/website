Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Front Seat adjustment...

If the seat has been reupolstered it can make a huge difference for a tall 
person, seems like many upolstery shops tend to over stuff the seats. I'm 
over 6 feet(and none too skinny on top of it) and I drive a 57 bus daily 
with no issues. The first time I sat in a fixed bench bus I just plain 
didn't fit, but later when i found my first 57 with og upolstery front seat, 
i realized it was because the seat was so puffy in the first bus. I'm closer 
to the wheel than in a later bus, but i haven't had any issues and my 
commute to work is a bit over 30 miles one way.
    I've also seen a drivers seat that was modified a bit by a taller owner, 
it was a 66 or 67 and they had removed the stock seat back and attached a 
piece of foam coverd with vinyl directly to the bulkhead to gain a little 
more space.

&gt; Thanks for the input. Thats a bummer though. I really like those old buses 
&gt; but if I cant even drive in traffic with on/off clutch pedal leg 
&gt; straining, seems like a no-go. Was there no-one over 6 foot 
&gt; pre-60's???????
&gt;  It seems like the seat is not so much of the problem as is the seat back. 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas or things they've done to modify it to work 
&gt; with longer legs/taller people? My 67 drives fine! ---- JD
