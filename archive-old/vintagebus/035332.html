Hi Andrew,
Sounds like you did not install a fuel filter sock (111 209 147 A) in there.  
Which can be fun when you get a piece of floating debris in the tank to get 
sucked down onto the outlet tube to clog it.  This will cut off the fuel to 
the engine and once the vaccum in the fuel line   Alot of volks use the fuel 
filter sock with it's aluminum rim to seal there.  We prefer to install a 
fuel proof gasket on top of the fuel filter sock as was done at the factory.  
We have found a gasket material at Shuck's Auto parts stores that can be cut 
into flat exhaust gasket material or can be used for fuel gasket material.
