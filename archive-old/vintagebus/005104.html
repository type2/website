Hmmm....
in-laws garage where the work really happens:
- 75 scirocco hiding in the right corner... my wife says it's crying because
it's been left out of all the activity lately.  I'm waiting to find an old
16 valve Oettinger head for it.  Right now, it's acting as a shelf for the
side gates of the double cab.
- in the middle, 58 ghia convertible.... driveable right now but really
needs a new battery.  The Mag/Okrasa 36er will go in this one when I get all
the parts and the time to build it.
- on the other side, the 59 double cab on jack stands, slowly being put back
together.... waiting for a complete undercarriage cleaning so the front beam
and transaxle can be put back in.... boy, I just cant wait to spend a few
weeks under there with cleaning tools...
- tool box in the front whos top acts as manual holder and small parts
assembly.
- bench 1 on the far left side... acts as a bench for all types of semi
greasy/oily work.
- bench 2 in the front room of the garage... acts as clean area for window
frames, etc.
- bench 3 also in front room acts as storage and staging area for all types
of clean/new parts
- couch in front room... parts holder as well.
- balcony of main garage room acts as long term storage

- Garage at my houses (complete with dirt floor) covers the 64 and 66 future
bug projects, lawn mower, misc other things.

- Basement of my house with table for assembling cleaned and rechromed
goodies like latches, fans, speedos, etc.


Now if I just had three other bays for the other cars...  and then I think
of the recent 'therapy thread' and people with too many VWs...
