Subject: re:Brake Line Grommetts
Mime-Version: 1.0

I apologize if my question was too vague, yes the grommets are split on the side, so no need to take the brake lines apart.
The issue is the fact that the grommets are u-shaped in section, I imagine that they are like windshield gaskets(which will be a question in a future post) but too small to get a string around. Basically I am having trouble getting the inner edge in.

Thanks for the suggestion of soap, I'll try that and let y'all know.
