Subject: Re: [VB] RPM/ Gearing??

I run 205/75 R15s on my 61 bus.  Have for ten years.   they are a bit taller 
than the 205 70 R15s.

Having taller tires is a cheaper and quicker way of effectively making it 
higher geared.   The size tires I am running are very close to stock for the bus 
size... the 165 R15s are stock for a beetle, but smaller than the ones a bus 
came with.
