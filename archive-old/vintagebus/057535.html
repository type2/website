&gt; I just submitted my plans for a permit to build my new garage,
&gt; and won't be needing the Cozmo tarp-shed setup anymore.  The
&gt; existing panels are toast, but the poles are in good shape.  It
&gt; comes with brand new (NOS!) panels and NOS dingleberries to attach
&gt; them.  It was almost $200 for the new panels!  Also - it comes with
&gt; an extra end panel (NOS!) so that you can fashion a door.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the Sacramento area and can deliver locally.
&gt; 
&gt; New, I think they're $175, when they have them in stock.  Make a reasonable
&gt; offer.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have some other various bus parts FS that I'll be liquidating
&gt; over the next couple of weeks - I have to pay for this garage somehow!
