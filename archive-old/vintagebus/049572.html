So I's rescued one O them nifty 'ufo' hanging-on-a-bracket oilbath
aircleaners from a friend's junkyard... cleaned it up, popped open the
decklid of my 65 and see: not only that two-hole hanging bracket hanging
from the upper right corner, but a big black PLATE that goes between the
wheel housing and the top frame. This piece has two straps w/ the expected
buckle thingys; they are formed into somewhat of a trapezoid shape .
Hmmmmm. Ufo thing does NOT fit in there, nor is there clearance for it to
hang above it.

Checked my parts manual; the big bracket is shown as being correct for 68
and up s/c, using the bigger can of a 1600 oilbath (which I assume gets
strapped in there).

So is there a different oilbath that uses both/one/neither of these
hangers,  or did the po bolt a newer bracket into the older truck when
converting to 1600? To be honest, the circumference of the 'trapezoid'
formed when the straps are buckled down seems smaller than a 1600 can, but
I haven't dug out the spare to try it...........
