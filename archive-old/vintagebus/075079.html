Subject: Saved by the Costco Canopy

   Last night I got home from Pomona Swap and pulled into my new garage
(that felt good). Looking out through the in completed walls I noticed that
the power line to my house was at head level, WTF, I think to myself?. I
look over to the lower lot and saw that a 20 foot long, 8&quot; round limb had
broken off one of my trees and had fallen on the power line to my house. The
limb was being supported by the power line and my Costco Canopy which had my
15 window deluxe parked underneath it. Needless to say I called the power
company and they inspected the damage and showed up again at 7 am this
morning to remove the limb. I had to move 4 of my buses (which to the power
companies surprise all run and drive) in order for them to reach the tree
and within minutes the limb was gone with the only damage done was a big rip
in the canopy.
Kudos to the canopy for saving my 15 window, I'm sure if the limb had landed
on the roof of the bus some serious damage would have been sustained.
   I must thank them for being careful,  as they were very careful cutting
this up and didn't damage either of the 2 buses that were still parked next
to the tree.


Ronnie an exciting morning
