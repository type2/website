This is totally unbelieveable, I cannot believe the fact that this has
happened..

I'm still in the inactive reserves, US Marine Corp....To be honest I would
be proud to close the shop, and take a little trip to help solve this
problem!!!!!

Subject: [BSKA] Pearl Harbor revisited.


&gt; I couldn't believe what I was hearing on the radio today at work.  As
&gt; various contractors came in and reported what they had seen and heard, it
&gt; soon became evident to me that certainly the feelings of the Pearl Harbor
&gt; era were certainly revived once again.
&gt;
&gt; I just got home from work about 20 minutes ago and saw what appeared to be
a
&gt; Hollywood special effect of a big old passenger jet plowing into one of
the
&gt; twin towers of the WTC.  I've seen these bldgs in person and couldn't
&gt; believe my eyes.  What a tragedy.
&gt;
&gt; Since we are a generation or 2 away from Pearl Harbor, it's all too easy
for
&gt; people who weren't there to not realize the severity of the deed and the
&gt; impact it had on people at that time.  Some have even gone so far as to
pity
&gt; the &quot;enemy&quot; and the lives lost while they took the offensive.  This holds
&gt; true in any war that happened.  It doesn't take long for naysayers to
spring
&gt; up and people to deny things like this ever happened such as the
Holocaust,
&gt; etc.  Learn a lesson that history teaches you and NEVER let time diminish
&gt; your spirit and your patriotism.
&gt;
&gt; James Lindsay put it well when he said now is not the time for revenge
&gt; rather a time for greiving for all the lives lost.  For the servicemen and
&gt; rescue personel who will lose their lives over this and who are continuing
&gt; to assist in the rescue and security efforts, we're all deeply indebted to
&gt; them.  Honor your veterans past, present, and future.  Learn from history
&gt; folks and don't ever get complacent about where you stand in life.
