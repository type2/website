My advice is to stop worrying.  Sounds like you have prepared.  do pack a 
tool box to take with you, spare oil, 3 qts, and a few spares (tune up parts, 
and a spare tire at least).   I have a little metal box that lives in my bus 
with spare tune up parts and extra light bulbs that sort of stuff in it.

The important thing in my own opinion is to use it as a daily driver for the 
next 19 days.  

This way is any kinks show up, you'll be near home, and if not, 
groovalicious!!!!   Is your speedo cable broken or disconected?   A working 
odometer is important I think so at least.  How long  have you had the bus?   
 if you haven't had it very long, and as it has sat a while, do an oil 
change/ valve adjust a day or two before you leave, and do a tea leaf reading 
of the oil.  Are you caravanning with friends?   A good idea for fun and just 
in case you need to give them a ride to the parts store :)  Have a great time 
driving your bus.

 Hello All, 
 
       Well here's where I'm at. I have 19 days left until my maiden
 voyage of 507 miles round trip to BNNTA. This is my first trip of any
 length in my bus, and I'm a little nervous. So far here is a list of
 things done in the last couple months to get ready.
 
 1. New exhaust
 2. New tires and shocks
 3. New master cyl, brake lines and rear pads
 4. New axle boots
 5.Tranny flush
 6.New plugs and wires
 7.New battery
 8.New (used) gas tank
 9.Adj. valves
 10. Greased undercarriage
 11. Changed oil
 12.New fuel filter
 13.New air filter
 14. Lights working except hazard and domes.
 
 O.K. thats the list. I've got a 73 or 74 bug motor and have no clue how
 many miles are on it. The speedo isn't working, so no odometer. It
 starts with no problem. It doesn't make any funny sounds or leak or
 shake like the bejesus. It seems to have good get up and go and the
 tranny doesn't sound like an accident waitin to happen. Now here is MY
 problem. This bus had been sitting for a few years and I'm scared as
 hell about the upcoming trip. Nothing at all seems to be wrong. That's
 what freaks me out. I've got a long trip and it would break my heart and
 credit card if I broke down. Does anyone have any advice as to what I
 may be missing or over looked?  I just don't want to miss the event, or
 drive my chevy! I've been told by friends to stop,  that I'm worrying
 for no reason that everything seems fine. But they have never owned a VW
 before. Any and all words of wisdom would be great! Thanks.
