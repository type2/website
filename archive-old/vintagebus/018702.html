I have nice (Mexican I think) painted hubcaps on my '62 truck.  The truck has a big nut tranny in it and I can't get the hubcaps to fully seat on the rear wheels.  They stay on fine, but will not fully snap on to the rims. They are hitting the axle nuts and stopping the full engagement.  Are there such things as &quot;late&quot; hubcaps or are all bus hubcaps the same??
