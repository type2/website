Well it's official.  After paintstakingly installing the remote oil filter
&quot;just so&quot; and test firing the bus, I've still got that popping noise.
Getting underneath the bus and switching off the trouble light while
reaching up and bumping the throttle shows me a ring of fire and soot around
the #4 cylinder to head seal.  Damn.

So my options for BNNTA are to take that old standby 1600 and &quot;help&quot; it out
a little bit with my dual 34ICT's, and 1.25 ratio rockers or get the 1776
pulled, tore apart, and new heads put on.  Funny but I might do both.  I'm
going to do a little research tonight and see what kind of heads CB could
send out to me.  My brother says for a good reliable bus engine I should
keep the compression at 6.9:1 (where it currently is but with new heads I'm
going to have to yank the cylinders and do the CC work all over again) &amp; go
a ported head with stock valve sizes.  I know some of you have emailed me
with good suggestions for heads to run so I'll go back and re-read that
information.

I hope to order the CB heads tomorrow and in the meantime, start dismantling
the engine tins on this 1600 and get it powerwashed and cleaned up just in
case I have to use it for BNNTA.  I'm still optimistic but I must admit that
this first time engine rebuild is starting to turn into a pain in the ass.
