How are the Interior Clam lights powered?  I assume they are 110 volts when
plugged in?  Are they also powered by an inverter?  One more question:
Anyone have a source for reproductions?  I can't seem to fine a Kombi or
Westy that's in good shape for a fair price, so I'm going to buy a Kombi and
try and built my own interior.  Won't be orginal, but it will be mine and I
finally have a Split Window.

Thanks

Dave
