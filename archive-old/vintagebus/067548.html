&gt; hello
&gt; did i saw an email from you not long ago about not removing the pitman arm 
&gt; ??
&gt; well i did it before i read your mail, i wanted to remove the complete 
&gt; steering, so i removed in the same time the pit man arm.
&gt; Now, if its done, is there any procedure to get it back to his position ??
&gt; when i disaable it,  i though ill keep the tire straight forard, then find 
&gt; the middle steering zone, and put back the pitman.
&gt; your email alarmed me because i didnt know there was a positioning for this 
&gt; arm
&gt; what can i do ?    tx

Hi Mike,
Anytime the Pitman arm is removed and replaced on the steering box there is a 
good chance this arm will be repostioned in such a way that somewhere in its 
operating arc the arm will become parallel to the drag link causing the 
steering to lock up.  Sometimes even close to parallel will lock up the 
steering only when one is doing high speed cornering!  Best way to figure out 
your problem is to have a second bus of simular year to compare to.  Barring 
that you need to set the Pitman arm so it has as close as possible same 
degree angle to the drag link at either end of the steering box movement and 
at the same time keep as far away from parallel in the entire movement in the 
arc of the Pitman arm as possible.
Hope this helps,
Eric&amp;Barb
