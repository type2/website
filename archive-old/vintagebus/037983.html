&gt;  Because of business I have the opportunity to go to Wolfsburg and Hanover 
in
&gt;  Germany.  Does anyone know which one has the vintage tours or vintage
&gt;  museum?
&gt;  

the old automuseum stiftung in wolfburg is very good, but you really have to 
check out the autostadt as well.  the historical museum there is excellent, 
and large.  They have lots of old buses, including barndoors,  John Lennon' s 
beetle- the one on the cover of Abbbey Road, as well as messershmidts and 
issettas and all kinds of neat stuff.   There are many different buildings in 
the autostadt, the historical museum is only one of them.  We missed the 
tour, but whatever.  Gets lots of postcards!!! Nice gift shop.  There is an 
internet cafe in the village just next to Wolfsburg- a old village with those 
old beamed houses.

Hameln is Hamlin, as in the Pied Piper of, isn't it?
