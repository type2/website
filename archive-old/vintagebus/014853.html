yesterday as i was planning for BBBIV, (bus content) i took apart the
2180cc that i had in my 68 baja and found an 82mm OKRASA counterweighted
crankshaft. journals are std/std, non-welded . i paid a guy 400$ for this
motor ten years ago. now if i stuff this classic crank into my &quot;stale air&quot;
40 hp, do i qualify as a guy big on vintage , or , a guy that has benn out
in the desert sun too long.
