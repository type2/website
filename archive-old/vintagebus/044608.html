 I was over at a VW guy's house yesterday and he had a bunch of cargo mats
 all laid out on his front walkway (damn showoff).  We noticed all of them
 were slightly different and the question came up, is there a way to date
 a cargo mat based on it's markings or style?  All of the mats in question
 were black, in this case.
 &gt;&gt;

well, there are ones for 2/3 or for full width middle seats.  I have also 
seen panel van ones, with NO holes for seat hold downs.   The ones with the 
extra slots ( for seat belts)by the seat hold down holes are bay window.  The 
shape is slightly diffrernt too, but you can put one in your split. Yes they 
also changed the way the markings were, but I don't know the details.  and 
there are coloured ones for the 66/67 deluxes (which also got matching rubber 
mats under the front seats)  I have several mats in my garage to keep my feet 
from getting cold in the winter, and its softer on your feet too.  Assorted, 
included some splitty ones some DPO cut shorter.
