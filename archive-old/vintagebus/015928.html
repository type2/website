Subject: WTB rear corners (butt cheeks) for 61 SC
Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 13:10:17 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

If anyone has a good set of rear corner (butt cheeks to some) for a 61 SC 
for sale, drop me a line. Some did a BAD thing and cut the holes bigger for 
those aftermarket round trailer tail lights.

Thanks,
David
