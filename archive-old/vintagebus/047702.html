Subject: My new busses!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am stoked!  Went to an auction today, and got two busses for my trouble.  
One is &quot;The Grateful Dead&quot; bus, a '66 standard with, as far as I can tell, NO 
rust through.  (I love living in the desert.)  Lots of homemade graphics. The 
other is a late (big turn signal) something or other, but it only cost $20!!! 
 Now if I only had room to get the '66 off my trailer to pick up the other 
one.....

Kerry got a late model for about the same as my cheap one, and lots of other 
things went really cheap.  Micah got four vehicles and some other stuff, and 
spent about $70.

Wow,

JP
