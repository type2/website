Hi,
Yes, probably due to different models and/or accessories at the factory.  
Case in point is Clara's deluxe non-sunroof.  The speedo pod is of the 
earlier square shouldered upper corners, but her bus has a chassi number past 
the change over number for the later rounder upper cornered speedo pod.  This 
was probably due to it being both a deluxe and having factory safaris 
installed.  After all which would be quicker to assemble?  Clara's deluxe 
with safaris or a plain Jane panel van?  Most likely there were sub-assembly 
lines that some VWs were pulled off to have extras added to.  This probably 
could have added a couple of days to the particular VW leaving the factory.  
The early VW bus having the chassi number stamped into the bulkhead probably 
was done at the beginning of assembly, while the later bus with it's M-code 
tag might have been only stamped just before painting.   Eric&amp;Barb
