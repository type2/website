&lt;&lt;hello all,
i found not one, not two, but three single cabs for sale outside of town.
They are selling for very cheap. The guy said that he bought all three so he
could make one out of them. This leads me to believe that, between the three
of them, they are pretty complete. Ok, first question. The single cabs are
57, 62, and 63. Now, I know 63 is when they made a lot of changes. So, what
were the major changes that I should keep an eye out for? Gate differences?
lock differences? other wierd single cab stuff?

Ok, next question. I know a lot of people on the list have single cabs that
they need parts for. If I think the project will be too big to take on, I
may buy them anyway and just part them out to all y'all on the list (sorry,
i just had to say &quot;all y'all&quot;). So, if you guys can let me know what you
need and how much you're willing to pay for such parts, it will help me make
my decision. I'd rather leave these parts open to listmembers instead of
selling them on ebay or at swapmeets, so let me know.

BTW, I have not looked at these buses yet, so I don't know much about them.
TIA,
Casey
