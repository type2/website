Subject: 8v battery instead of 6v???


A camaro enthusiest friend of mine has a stock early 60's VW.  He said his 
mechanic installed a 8 volt battery (interstate) and adjusted his voltage 
regulator to just over 8v so he would have some extra boost.  I looked at my 
36hp's 6v regulator and did not see a way of adjusting voltage.  Anyone know 
anything of using 8 volt battery and the particulars??  TIA
