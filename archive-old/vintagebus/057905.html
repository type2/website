Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Revisited

Reading this comment brings to mind a favorite quote of mine...

&quot;Parts left out cost nothing and have an infinite service life.&quot;

Chas. (Boss) Kettering

I have always felt that this best answers the question, &quot;Do I really 
need (insert stock part of your choice here) or can I leave it off?&quot;

If it could have been left off, you can bet that the finance guys would 
have insisted on it.  Those two pieces of tin probably cost VW a buck. 
Multiply that times the number of air-cooled engines that they were 
installed on and you're starting to talk real money. I don't think that 
I've ever seen a VW air-cooled engine that didn't originally have them. 
Must have been a sound engineering reason to spend that buck...

It was written that:

&gt; Another webmaster (who will remain nameless) and I were having an arguement
&gt; about how useless the lower tin was.
