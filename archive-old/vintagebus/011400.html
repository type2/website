&gt; This may be a dumb question but how can he 'own' the club?  I don't
think I
&gt; understand the nature of car clubs.
&gt; 
&gt; On a side note, here's a story:
&gt; They sent me a note asking for a link to their web site, which
happens to
&gt; end in _dot_org  It was my understanding that _dot_org was for non-profit
entities
&gt; so I asked if SOTO was a non-profit club.  No response yet...  :)

Just because they say that they are a non-profit club, they don't have
to act like one.  There are a lot of non-profits that are firmly in
the grip of one person or group of people who definitely profit from
them.  Credit unions are supposedly non-profit organizations, but try
to organize a campaign to take control of one from its established
officers!

I notice that Heard bills himself as the president of SOTO, and no
other club officers are listed on the website.

Can anyone tell me when the last election was held to select officers
for SOTO?  This would give a good idea of how democratic the Society
really is.

George
