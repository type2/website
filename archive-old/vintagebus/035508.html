 Dear List,
 I am at the point of ordering a headliner for my '67 deluxe, and need
 some recommendations as to the very best source. Will any good auto top
 shop be able to install this, or should I check out auto restoration
 shops? I also need the same material for the area between windows.  Is
 it available by the yard? And how hard is it to install?
 I also still need blue/white/blue front door panels to complete my
 interior.  
 That's all for now....thanks.
 Susan
 
 
Cheapo jobs can be done with headliners available from your local flaps. But 
there's a
lot more to it than meets the eye. The cheapo jobs, if you want to try it, 
can be had
for about $50 ($150 for a bus) and you install. It's best to get a VW shop to 
do it, however, in which case the cost is about $200 and takes about one day 
to complete. Buses can run up to $1,000 to $1,500. And, convertibles and 
rag-tops are maybe $300 to $400. And most VW shops will try to justify your 
not installing the headliner even when torn - their reasoning being that the 
headliner is a bitch to install. But most independent shops that specialize 
in upholstery can install them; albeit for a fee. The last one I had made 
cost me $400 for a 1974 Beetle, and I got gypped. So, go with anything 
between $200 and $400  for a beetle or $1000- $1500 for a bus and you choose 
the material. About the other material for the interior, you can get by with
standard panels for busses.
