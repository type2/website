Subject: Re: [VB] Light bulb cross reference...

&gt;From: &quot;Bill Bowman&quot; &lt;BussesByTheArch18_at_msn_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;My question is:  Can anyone point out a cross reference guide to the
&gt;various light bulbs used on our older VW's.

I don't know of one that's out there already, but here's a shot at
one.

First, a word about bulb numbering.  The VW literature lists bulbs
by their &quot;Normteile&quot; (standard part) numbers and also by their
designation under DIN 72601.  For example, the license plate light
bulb is N 17 718 1 and G 6 V 10 W.  Here in the US, we usually buy
bulbs by their ANSI numbers, which are simply assigned to each new
bulb design as it comes along.  For example, 1157 is a common
stop/tail bulb for older American cars.

Different bulb vendors have approached the problem of integrating
European and US bulb designations in different ways.  Wagner seems
to assign five-digit numbers to European bulb types, while GE has
an &quot;international series&quot; of bulbs that are given designations
similar to the DIN 72601 numbers, like P21W or W5W.

There are a few bulbs on a VW that I haven't been able to find at
the FLAPS.  These include the non-sealed-beam headlight for non-US-spec
Buses, the instrument panel warning lights, and the dome lights.
You'll probably have better luck finding these bulbs at your FLVWPS
or from one of the mail-order vendors.

If you're looking to upgrade, halogen headlamps work well.  Blue
and &quot;superwhite&quot; headlamps are illegal and don't work anyway.  You
can sometimes find a brighter bulb that will fit a certain application,
but be careful - brighter means more heat.  For something that's not
on all the time (brake lights) this can work well; for something that
runs all the time (license light) it can melt lenses.

In the table, I have tried to list the closest match I can find to the
VW bulb specifications.  I am using a Wagner bulb catalog for the
ANSI bulb specifications.
