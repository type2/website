Subject: It's Alive ! Volks-Air compressor

http://www.angelfire_dot_com/biz/dunnright/DR3.html

ArrrrOOOO !! ( My best &quot;Tim the Tool Man &quot; html:)
I fired up my new Volks-Air compressor today !
For the uninformed, you can get a kit to convert a 
1600 Dual Port T1 engine into a serious tool.
Your basic garden variety beetle engine has
roughly 56 horsepower, not much until you
consider that by dividing that number in half,
you will have a 28hp air compressor which will
output 58CFM _at_ 100psi ! (Try that on 220 volts:)
It is essentially a stock engine fitted with a trick 
camshaft which allows the front two cylinders to 
pump air in 2-cycle mode into a small tank
which serves as a buffer to the 3/4 i.d.output hose.
From 100 feet,it sounds like dualling lawnmowers.
It sips gas and runs at idle speed and has got to 
be the ultimate sandblaster for it's size and ease
of maintenance and cost of spare parts as well.
This could be your best bus rust solution.
I owe it all to Raymond Heath, who's tag line was
the inspiration. Thanx, Ray ! Now I need a Trike :)!!!
