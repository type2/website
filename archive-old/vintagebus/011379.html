   Don't throw it away. Somebody will come and get it or as soon as you do
get rid of it you WILL need it. It doesn't really sound to me like you have
too much stuff. Man, I wish that was all I had laying around. I have an 8 X
10 shed half full of VW stuff. I did actually go through most of it last
month. So hopefully I'll be taking most of it to swap meets. A couple of
months ago I gave a friend some tin and a dog house he was looking for. 
  Sorry but I don't have any Split stuff. Most of it is early Bubble.
