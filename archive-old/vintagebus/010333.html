I have to agree with these observations.

Many assume that any inaccuracy in their speedometer is duplicated in their
odometer.  This is rarely the case.

The odometer is driven mechanically, through a gear train in the speedometer
head that's, in turn, driven by the speedometer cable.

The speedometer needle is driven by a magnetic field.  There is no direct
mechanical connection between the speedometer/odometer gears/innards and the
speed indicating needle.  This is one reason why speedometers lose accuracy
over time.

For example, the speedometer error in my '70 bus is ~ 7 : 5.  The odometer
error is .2 miles in 10 measured miles.

With my current tires, true 60 MPH is an indicated 82.5 MPH.  I have the
corrections at various speeds memorized, and use them instinctively, but for
the benefit of uninformed passengers I've posted a table of speed
corrections in a prominent place on the dashboard.  If nothing else it keeps
the screams of mistaken terror down to an endurable level.

&gt;&gt; Ummm, these various numbers and stats are all very well and good, but how
many of you have A) had your odometers calibrated, and B) had your
speedometers calibrated?  Without the first, you don't know how far
you are actually driving, and without the second, you don't know how fast.
For instance, given the optimism of the typical VW speedometer, you're
probably only doing 5/6 of what you think you are.  Similar arguments apply
to the odometer.  I used to think I was getting pretty good mileage, until I
clocked the odometer against the mile markers.... &lt;&lt;
