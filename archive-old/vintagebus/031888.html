Thats what i want.
A rolling stand to use with no suspension attached.

&lt;&lt;What would be cool would be some type of rolling frame with four supports
for the jack points. That way you could move the bus around without the
wheels (or tranny/front end) attached. It would have to be high enough to
get the wheels off though.
