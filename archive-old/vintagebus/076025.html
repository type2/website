&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;I was told that barndoor taps are manually operated and that the 
&gt;later ones worked with the cable from the cockpit.
yup. i have a photo from a manual that was mailed to me (clara? e&amp;b?) 
showing the snazzy barndoor setup: a lil chrome hole and cover (like 
the gas filler door's); the driver is putting a long rod with a slot 
at the end thru the hole... he grabs the lever on the fuel tap with 
the slot and turns it to get the reserve!  if i can find the scanner 
(everything is packed up right now) i'll post it up.
me, i just crawl under and swing the lever by hand.


&gt;Which prompts another few questions:
Can a barndoor tap be operated by the cable
&gt;Do we need to use some sort of adapter in case we go to a 68-71tank?
yes and yes.
  you will need to cut out and weld in a bracket arrangement from a 
splitty to make it work in a bay... or fab one from scratch.
you also need to route the cable thru a hole you make in the cab.
but it can be done.


&gt;Do both early and late taps have the same thread for the tank?
they must - the barndoor tap screwed right on my 70 tank.

&gt;And, last but not least, an ancillary question
&gt;The other day i changed the fuel line ... where is it supposed to go?
see the library - there should be a writeup on getting fuel hose from 
tank to pump, and the bulkhead fitting to make up.
