&gt; &quot;For the vintage community, we are still planning to produce V262
&gt; (Volkswagen
&gt; Transporter Workshop Manual: 1950-1962). This manual will be reproduced
&gt; from
&gt; original factory workshop manuals and is expected to be available by
&gt; Sept.
&gt; 1st. Page count is expected to be approximately 1200 pages and retail
&gt; price
&gt; will be $109.95.&quot;
