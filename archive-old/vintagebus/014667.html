VW List,

I am looking for more information on how VW uses their part numbers.  
According to what I have been able to find on Type2 is that its general form 
is:

TCS-MSS-###

T=Type  could range from 1-4 based on vehicle type

C=Chassis  Does anyone know what these designations would be?

S=Side  Odd for left, Even for right, No Handed...=1

M=Main Group  0-9  found list on type2

SS=Subgroup  found on type2



Mainly does anyone have the list of numbers and what they mean for the C 
designation.

Thanks for the help.
Mike
