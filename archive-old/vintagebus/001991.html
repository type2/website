Subject: Where to get good bus parts.

(Whoa - I don't know what happened there - I selected &quot;send later&quot; and it
sent it now...weird)

In preparation for my 66 bus &quot;renewal&quot; project, I'm wanting to replace some
major parts with brand new ones.  I'm wanting to have a nice solid driver,
just as good as my 74 Super, with the intent of going places and doing
things.  So right off the bat, I want a new front beam, new steering box,
and following the suggestion of a kind listee, I'm gonna get a swingaxle
tranny made with 74 Super gearing and leave the redux boxes on for the
ground clearance and added durability due to using a more powerful engine
that what was stock on this bus..

I've been keeping my head above water, paying attention to previous info on
who is able to supply me with a replacement beam.  I checked the busdepot
page but can only find parts at present.  Also, I've heard what the list has
had to say about Bus Boys and would rather not go that route.  Is there a
place that anyone can suggest that would take my old core and give me a good
solid totally rebuilt front beam.  Mine may not even be wore out but I want
to just pull it off and replace it with a new beam and forget about worrying
if I replaced this part properly or not.

I'm open to all suggestions and if any of you type 2ers are in the business
of rebuilding beams and such, I'm open to all private interest as well.

Thanks...
