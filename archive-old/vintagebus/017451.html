I saw an interesting one a few days ago.  It was a variation on
the &quot;I (heart) ____&quot; theme; It read &quot;I (heart) girls&quot;, but the heart
was done in a rainbow.

The *funny* part was it was on a rice-boy-in-progress &quot;street weapon&quot;
driven by some punk ass kid who couldn't have been more than 17.  Maybe
it was his mom's car...

Another good one is:

&quot;Jesus was my co-pilot, but we crashed in the mountains and I had to eat him&quot;
