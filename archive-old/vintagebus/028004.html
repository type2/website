I think pics would blow my &quot;cover&quot; on where it's at.

I'd rather have a RHD than a DD any day, and this ones not too big of a
project (like the '53 DD in Oregon) plus everything is there bumpers,
taillights, etc. it needs rust repair but comes with *much* NOS parts and
replacement pieces for roughly $4500. I paid about that for a BD Single AND
BD Panel awhile back. That's why I'm looking for something that says go for
it!!!
