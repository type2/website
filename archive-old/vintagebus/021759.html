Does anybody know whether the bus owner's manuals changed mid year when
features did?  I have an early 64 that has many 63 characteristics (15 inch
rims, elbow engine lid prop, early style door handles, etc.) and wondered what
manual would be the appropriate one.  Did the manuals have months or just
years?
