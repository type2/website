Subject: Got myself a splittie! Need a hand

Hi Volks,

Well it finally happened.  I found myself a very complete '66 Deluxe.
Pics can be seen at
http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/66Deluxe.htm  I bought it from
the original owner and it has been in storage for 22 years.  Thanks goes
out to Thom F for the post about the ad.  The bus is a 7 passenger
walkthru that has everything (middle seat, Sapphire radio and all!) The
only missing is the clock.  It actually has an air-conditioning unit
installed but not functioning. Very solid with a few dings here and
there.  I am so psyched.  Wait till the kids at school see the kooky
math teacher drive up in this.  I went down on Saturday to exchange $$
with the owner and I plan to pick it up this Saturday.  Anyone in the
Richmond area want to help me load the bus on a trailer?  The bus is in
Toano Virginia.  I'll keep you all updated on it's progress.

Jamie Auch
