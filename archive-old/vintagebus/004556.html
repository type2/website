Subject: Re: Jerome

Let as many of us that can, go to Jerome this weekend in support of the
 ABC in order to to donate the proceeds to help out in NYC &amp; Wash.
  Liz and I will attend and donate as much as we can!  It maybe just a =
symbolic=20
gesture but this is what our great country is all about, freedom!  Let's =
not=20
change our lifestyles because of these criminal acts.
  We should all do what we can.
   Sadly,
    Lou &amp; Liz in Havasu
