My company is searching for a late 60's/early 70's VW bus for photography
purposes to shoot for an ad. 

Do you know of someone who owns a bus in the Central Fresno Valley (CA) that
would consider offering their bus? To be paid for their time, of course.

Please send them my email/phone info and have them contact me as soon as
possible since the photo shoot is scheduled to take place on Wednesday,
March 10. 

Sorry for the late notice as our scheduled bus is not operable as of this
week end. 

Thank you! Peace.
