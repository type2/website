Hi neil,

But... i have looked at pix of your 58, and i have looked at an original
58 safari bus in person and there is one difference.  On the 62 and older
busses only the safari busses got the upper indent in the window channel,
this doesnt look to be added to yours... so even though you have the
correct securing plate, you dont have the indent, which makes the
installation not as the VW factory intended.

But, correct me if i'm wrong... (i often am...)

take care,

Steve

p.s. the original safari 58 i speak of no longer has the safaris but i can
take a picture of the indents...
