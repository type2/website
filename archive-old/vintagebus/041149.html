Thanks for the info, folks. I spoke to Bob at Wiring Works, and he was very
helpful. A new wiring harness is less than 200 bones if paid, in advance. If
COD, then have'ta add another 8 smacks for shipping. I figured the wiring on
my bus is almost 40 years old. By replacing the harness, while I have it all
&quot;torn apart&quot;, it should last quite a bit longer. After receiving all the
awesome responses, one thing that kept coming up was fires (either listees
had had them, or heard of folks who had 'em, due to faulty wiring). Now, I'm
not sure of the validity of the &quot;actual&quot; numbers, but seems like something
to be wary of, yes?
Seems like the extra effort, now, will be worth it in the long run... Any
comments?
Thanks, again.
