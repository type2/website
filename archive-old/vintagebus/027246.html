Subject: re: Redux box woes!

I have this kit on my lap right now... Recoil brand, part #37125. I paid
$40 for it, plus another $8 for a 31/64&quot; drill bit. The drill bit turned
out to be unnecessary, as the stripped hole was already big enough for
the tap...

You will want to repair these holes ASAP, and in the meantime make sure
the other bolts are tight. If the redux boxes are allowed to shift
around on the spring plates while you're driving around, you will ruin
the other holes and possibly make them too enlarged to fix with this
kit.

I once unknowingly let mine get so loose that all the holes were ruined.
On the way home from a big bus event, driving on a 12-lane Atlanta
interstate during truck traffic, with the bus all over the lane, I was
so scared $#!+less that I had to pull over and call Dave E. and Charlie
F. to come rescue me (thank heavens for those guys). Don't let this
happen to you!
