&gt;Secondly does anybody have any suggestions on a service/workshop manual
&gt;for these early busses.

There are two - a '63-'67 edition and a '50-'62 edition.  They are
published by Bentley Publishers (nee Robert Bentley) and are very good.
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=V267  ('63-'67)
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=V262  ('50-'62)
Bentley sells them at list but several of the vendors who post here are
able to offer them at a good discount.  Some FLVWPS * carry them as well.
&lt;editorial&gt;Support your VW parts suppliers, not Spamazon!&lt;/editorial&gt;

&gt;I'm trying to find a good schematic so I know everything is right.

If you just mean 'exploded diagram of mechanical parts' then the manuals
above will probably help.  If you're looking for an electrical schematic,
the manuals above will help a little, but they have B&amp;W reprints of what
were originally color schematics.  The color schematics from the original
manuals have been scanned in and are available at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring .  You may also be interested in the
scanned-in parts manuals available at http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ .

I hope this helps!
