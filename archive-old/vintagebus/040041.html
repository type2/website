Philip &amp; Catherine asked
&quot;Do you think the reduction in oil temp is due to changing to the synthetic 
oil?  What temp had you been running at before you changed out the oil?  
After?&quot;

My uncalibrated VDO gauge before switching to synthetic would indicate  215 
degrees after running at 3750 RPM for 45 minutes.  After the switch running 
the same strech of road under similar ambient conditions the oil temp 
settled in at 175.  Almost too cool, takes after me I suppose 8^p

It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly 
how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President 
was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.
