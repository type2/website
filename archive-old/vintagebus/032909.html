&lt;&lt; Is there a way I could get thin  magnet strips and attach these with an 
 adhesive to the panels, then stick the panels onto the cargo doors/drivers 
 side wall? Would they hold up the 1/8 inch masonite? This may sound crazy, 
 but it's just an idea? &gt;&gt;

I bet you'd pick up &quot;Radio free Europe&quot; on your radio with all the magnets.
