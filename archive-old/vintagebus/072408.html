Subject: buying 65' Splitty barndoor info requested

Hi everyone, I found a 65' Splitty Barndoor that I'm gonna be purchasing, and I was just wondering if anyone had any useful information on these years. I own an 85' that I restored, and this one needs alot of work, but I don't mind. It will make a nice project for me cause I'm going to school for Automotive Technology. I realize that there's a big difference between waterboxers and aircooled busses, and I plan on reading up on that information. I've owned my bus for awhile now though, and I suspect that my knowledge on the bus I have now will come in handy anyhoo. A VW is always a VW. But anyways lemme know............

have fun,

Tracy

85' Gl &quot;Ripple&quot;
