Is it running really Rich or Really Lean?  I had similar problems with
my 63 delux and 72 Bug... Most of the time, there is some type of
air/vaccume leak where the carb is getting tooooo much air.  It could
also be caused by a bad gasket on the intake manifold.  When was the
last time the carb seals were checked?  Is the carb getting close to
rebuild time?

That just my 3cents....
