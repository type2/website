Hi Ttackman,
We saw one of those at Sacramento CA meet years ago and as far as we could 
tell it was either original old German made or someone had perfected 
duplicating the early bus German all steel roof racks. It even had a round 
circle on the front fence for a VW symbol.  So far though we have not found a 
trace of this round front 2/3 rack in any VW accessory or other literature.
