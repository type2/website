Hi All.,

The re assembly of the 59 dc is going at full steam (hahaha).  When I went
to put the clutch pedal arm back on I noticed the parts book listed a dust
shield that goes on the pivot pin between the arm and body.  I called Ronnie
and he didn't have one but suggested using one from a 914.

Anyone have one of these or a picture of one so I at least know what I am
looking for?

Oh, sorry for the minutia questions in advance... I know there will be
plenty more in the next several weeks as I put this thing back together.
Tell me to stop if you all get tired of them ;-)



Thanks
David
