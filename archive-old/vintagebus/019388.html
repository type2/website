The first clue woulda been that he had *10* of them!  Reminds me of the guy
_at_ KP one year selling what turned out to be RoundBoxTools toolkits.  They
were slightly scuffed, and he was asking $500+ for 'em.  The fact that
he had a whole stack of them shoulda been a clue...

&gt; all the original markings, but no VW symbol.  Upon close inspection we could

&gt; keep in mind that these apparently are being remade.  While these new ones 
&gt; are still a great item to have, do not to pay top dollar.  Most likely the 
&gt; market will be flooded soon with these.   Eric&amp;Barb
