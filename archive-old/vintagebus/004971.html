Hey Volks

Well, I couldn't restrain myself. I just bought the 1961 panelvan with
&quot;Oxford Radio&quot; signwriting that I posted on Thom's gallery a few weeks back.

I really don't need another bus. Apart from the list in my sig, I have
another seven splitties, all projects or parts cars, so now I have 13 in
all. Altogether on the plot where I store them there are 18 splitscreen
buses!

But I couldn't refuse this: the price was right and the bus is complete. It
has a correct stale air 1200 engine with the VW exchange stamp by the engine
number. There is no rust *at all*. It is complete and original, even has a
correct Bilstein jack; all the lights that are missing in the pics are in
the van; the only thing I can see missing is the hardboard cab divider. It
came with both its original Witte VW logod keys. The bus is riding on a set
of original 6.40x15 crossplies with plenty of tread. The body has lots of
small dings and scratches, the minimum one would expect from a working van.
There are signs of collision repair to the right front.

This van was last licensed in 1986 and, judging by its condition, has been
stored indoors ever since.

The van is South African assembled, so has no M-tag. VIN is 688490, which
dates it to June 1961. It would then have been shipped SKD to South Africa
for assembly and installation of locally sourced parts like batteries, tyres
and glass. I have no way of telling when VWSA assembled it.

Well, there you have it. I think I'll get it running and then give the
body/paint/signage a light massage, polish and touch-up.

NEXT INSTALLMENT: Yesterday I spotted a semaphore deluxe in a VW repair
yard. Then this morning one of my contacts called me to tell me about it and
that it's for sale. Price was ridiculous. Bus is not complete and had lots
of visible rust, but I couldn't get close to it. I'm going to see/photograph
it this week. Watch this space!
