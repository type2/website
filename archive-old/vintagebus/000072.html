&lt;&lt; I filled it up with 85/90 weight oil...is this correct?&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Correct!  

&lt;&lt;The new leaks seem to be coming from the side covers.  Are there seals in
 there that I should replace?&gt;&gt;
Yes, and check for corrosion on the spacers that run inside of these seals, 
and the lower axles.

&lt;&lt;I'm trying to get away with a little tear down as possible...how hard is it 
to pull these covers and replace any gaskets??&gt;&gt;
Best to tear everything apart and just go through every piece to check it for 
wear, and tear especially the bearings!

&lt;&lt; Do I have to unbolt the boxes from the spring plates to do this?? &gt;&gt;
Depends on what year reduction boxes you have there.  Though it is the 
1964-67 reductions require this to replace only the inner lower bearing.
