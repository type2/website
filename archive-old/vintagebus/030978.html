Subject: Re: [VB] Parts needed for 1970 Westy
References: &lt;102.2d17a11.282975b9_at_aol_dot_com&gt; &lt;00d601c0d8f7$7054c7e0$46709cd1_at_b4l1q0&gt;

&gt; [...]
&gt; So I measured both of them&quot;
&gt; 77 = 7/8'' wide, 3/8'' tall, 45'' long.
&gt; 70 = 1 1/8'' wide, 5/8'' tall, 46 3/4'' long.
&gt; Does this 70 strip sound like it may be the same as a split bus strip?

Out of my way too long a resto '65 pop top Westy.

47 7/16ths&quot;   long
1 1/16th&quot;       wide (bottom-smooth)
3/4&quot;               wide (top-grooved)

The strip is basically a U channel.  Wider on the bottom than on the top.  The
flooring slips in to it.  It is secured to the underlayment with 6 screws
through the &quot;bottom-smooth&quot; part.

I think the one on the 67 hard top I have is the same.

BTW anyone have a nice one they would like to sell?  Its one of the last parts
I need (he said pleading ;-)

Steve
