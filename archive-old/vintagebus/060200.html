Subject: Re: [T2] Problem using 34 PICT Carb on 1600DP

[...]

Andrew, I still have the left end from that middle section I sent you. It has
a manifold vacuum nipple on it. Want it?
If yes, send your address.

&gt; &gt; I'm in the process of building a 1600 DP for my 71 Bus using the
&gt; &gt; distributor and carb from a 73 Super Beetle.  Problem is that the 34
&gt; &gt; PICT used on the 73 Beetle doesn't have all the taps that the 34 PICT
&gt; &gt; used on the 71 Bus.  It only has one tap and that is for the vacuum
&gt; &gt; advance.  There is no tap on the carb for the retard side of the
&gt; &gt; diaphram.  The retard vacuum appears to come from a manifold tap just
&gt; &gt; below the carb on the 73 Beetle.
&gt;
&gt; Andrew... time to hit the yards....  the early 70's SBs had a manifold
&gt; vacuum tap drilled into the left DP manifold casting.  If yours is from a
&gt; '73 it *may* have it, my '71 SB did have it.  This is for the throttle
&gt; positioner originally, but provides perfectly adequate manifold vacuum for
&gt; the vac retard port on the dist as well.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm planning to forget about the retard and just leave the retard port
&gt; &gt; on the diaphram open.  I'll just time the engine to 34 BTDC at 3500
&gt; &gt; RPM.  Anybody see anything wrong with this?
&gt;
&gt; Nothing.  Per Karl, if you don't use the vac retard, time to 7.5 BTDC,
&gt; tho.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess I could tap the manifold but I'd rather avoid this.
&gt;
&gt; Take a look at the left end casting.  If you don't have the tap, you will
&gt; still see the place it goes cast into the end.  Take it to any decent
&gt; machine shop with  a section of properly sized hose and they can drill it
&gt; and swage in a port tube in 5 minutes or less, honest!
