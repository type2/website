&gt; I know about the Hoover bit. I have the fan housing and the piece that goes
&gt; over the tranee bell with the hole. What goes in between?

Hi Chris,
The Hoover bit closes the bottom of the inlet of the side of the cooler.  
Then you need the exhaust shell and exhaust tube to go to and through the front 
engine tin piece.  Check out the engine tin drawings at :

Make sure you use at least a doghouse 33mm wide (Inside measurement) cooling 
fan and the later 34, or 35mm is better!!  Anything less and you will have too 
high of engine temps.
