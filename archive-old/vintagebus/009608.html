-----Original Message-----


&gt;E-mail's acting up, so I didn't see the first list...but I didn't see
anything in Kyle's list that sounded excessive. I also toss in assorted
engine parts. I'm thinking of adding a milk crate to the inventory, as I
find myself doing top-end rebuilds on milk crates even though I now own a
regular engine stand.


I've been known to carry a spare engine.  Turns out it wasn't excessive
either.:)
