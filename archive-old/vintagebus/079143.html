Subject: Electrical Problems

Dear List;

I'm having electrical problems with my '66 bus. It is a 6 volt system. The bus
runs fine until I turn on my headlights or windshield wipers. As soon as I do,
the engine starts to run rough and lose power. When I turn the electrical
stuff off, it runs fine again. I replaced the voltage regulator and this
seemed to have solved the problem for awhile but now it's back again.
thanks in advance for any advice you may provide.

John Flowers
