 Chrome ones are usually aftermarket, and are usually don't have the correct
 ducting inside, as well a being a royal pain to fit.   &gt;&gt;

In my experience they are usually thinner tin and don't hold up very well 
either besides being a pain to fit.  If you do go with chrome make sure they 
are drilled for cooling flaps.
