&gt;okay,
&gt;
&gt;this item is listed at $1.00, an early bus gas gague... not a bad starting
&gt;price, so i read the fine print... $25.00 handling charge PLUS actual
&gt;shipping....
&gt;
&gt;how much handling could it take to put a fuel gague in a bubble pack and
&gt;drop it in the mail, i mean get real...  read that fine print people...

Here is the address of the greedy lister: &lt;nickm63_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Why not send him a note and tell him what you think of his 'Handling charge'?

They guy is currently running 17 other auctions.  A check of a few of them
revealed other outrageous handling charges.  How about a $15 boxing charge
for a Saphire radio?  How about a $50 boxing charge for a trombone?  A $15
handling charge for Beetle headlight and emergency light switches?
