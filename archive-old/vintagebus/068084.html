Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat kick panel question

Do you have the latch to make the folding part go up/down? Later later
66 and 67 middle seats were slightly different. Does the kick panel have
a little notch near the front?
Al


&gt; &gt;    I just bought a middle seat kick panel for my 67 deluxe full length
&gt; middle
&gt; &gt; seat, but it doesn't fit correctly. did the seats change frmo 66 to 67? Mine has a bar that
&gt; goes
&gt; &gt; from top to bottom that gets in the way of the mounting metal pieces.  Any
&gt; &gt; help would be very nice.
