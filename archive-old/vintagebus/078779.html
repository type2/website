Subject: Thanks for the starter help... and brakes

Y'all volk-a-maniacs,

I got my starter woes fixed.  I decided to just buy a new one ($99) and call
it fixed.  Wow that was easy to swap.  Thanks for all the advice.  The older
starter (Bosch SR17X) is much larger and heavier than the new one (Bosch
SR15N).  I may try to pull the old one apart and clean it up as suggested by
several of you.  It is always good to have a spare major part laying around...
right?  :o)

Now, my new issue.  My breaks are freaking me out.  I start out good with even
breaking and no pull, but after a few miles of random town traffic I start to
pull big time to the right (passenger side front) and the squeaking gets worse
and worse as I go.

I've replaced the rubber breaklines with nice new ones from WW about 2 months
ago.  I've checked, and have plenty of pad left on all four.  My master
cylinder isn't leaking and appears to work just fine (as my breaking works
fine for a few miles to start each time I drive).  I am going to try and
readjust tomorrow morning, but feel that since it mostly happens while hot,
perhaps adjusting when cool will not do much.

Any thoughts on why my breaks freak out?

Thanks in advance for your support,
Greg
