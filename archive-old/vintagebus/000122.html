Arent 12V bus gas guages tough to find being a 2 year only part?
66-67?
I thought those were kinda expensive, maybe Im wrong?
Ive never owned a 12V bus, let alone a bus with a gas guage so Im not an 
expert as far as prices but i thought that 12V gas guages were kinda sought 
after?

&gt; WHY? I personally don't care if it's NOS and does a song and dance when you 
open the box.  I have a beautiful 12v gauge from my
&gt; local wrecking yard that cost me a paltry $20...insanity appears to be 
spreading...
