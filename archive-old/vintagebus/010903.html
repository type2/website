&lt;&lt;  i need some info on swaping my 67 mc for an earlier one. on the back side 
of the 67 master cylinder there is an accordian type gasket that is torn up 
and brake fluid is leaking out. is this piece supposed to have break fluid in 
it, i thought it was just a dust guard.&gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
Yes that is just a dust guard to cut down on, but it can not eliminate the 
dust getting into there.  Please do not install an earlier MC they are not 
dual, but only single circuit master cylinders.  When, not if,  you blow out 
a metal or flex line or the slave (wheel) cylinder or even the single master 
cylinder you loose all your brakes.  With a dual master cylinder if any of 
the lines or slave cylinders blows or even one of the inner seals of the dual 
master cylinder goes you have about half you brakes to stop with!  Check the 
type2 library for our article for this adaption using the 72 and later bus 
dual circuit master cylinder.  You, your bus, and your passengers butts are 
worth the time and trouble!

&lt;&lt;to add to this my front right brake is not working as well as the others 
and ive tried adjusting it a few times.&gt;&gt;  Have you replaced your flex lines 
yet?  Also take off the drums on the front and check for any brake fluid 
seepage.  Eric&amp;Barb
