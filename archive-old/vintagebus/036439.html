Subject: Looking for Clamps for rack
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am looking for some clamps for my rack. It is hard to describe racks by 
words, but here goes. It is a genuine VW rack, can tell by the sticker on it. 
It is the taller of the metal racks and has no provisions on the rack itself 
for clamps. It is made of thinner material that the &quot;conduit appearance&quot; of 
the industrial racks. Bars run only from side to side of bus, no front to 
rear bars. The clamps look like three pieces, a hook for the drip rail, a 
&quot;two hook claw&quot; for the rack, and a threaded piece that joins the two 
together and is tightened by a placing a screwdriver or something similair 
and turning. Need these please, if you have any questions about what kind of 
rack I have and you might have clamps, please P-mail me. I will try to find a 
picture of what I am describing.
                    Mike
