Subject: Mystery Heater Box???     ?

Hey people of the lists:

In my collection of VW parts, I found a fresh air heater box with a 50mm 
outlet hole. (where the hose going to the body connects). I know that later 
ones have a 60mm outlet.

Does anyone know what year Bug or Bus uses this 50mm heater box?
