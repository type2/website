Subject: Re: [VB] Fog lights/Utillity

A few years ago when Unity was selling those sets for 30 bucks, someone
posted to the list what they had found.  Ironically, a few days later
those same lights showed up on the Samba for &quot;$90&quot; bucks....hmmmmm. 
Well, I guess there's a sucker born every minute...God knows I've been
one more than once in my life.  Not this time though.  $90 for $30
dollar lights?  I don't think so.

&gt; Sure, $150.00 for Bosch, maybe! Right after I posted
&gt; to the list I was offered a set for $90+ bucks! It
&gt; definately pays to shop around!
