Oh Robert, don't stop!

How about a front curtain rod?  For $18.5k they coulda installed a
radio, or at *LEAST* a block-off plate!

I've had several people ask me if I'd sell my '55, so I said what the 
hey, and listed a price of $20k (to weed out the tire kickers)
I think I'm moving it up to $25k

Forget your 401k Robert - your retirement is sitting there in the body shop!

&gt; Here's a '60 Westy for sale, restored.  Center table appears to be missing, forward cabinet (the one the breadbox sits on) appears to be missing, claims to have original curtains but look far from original, no icebox cabinet (o.k. it was an option), huge speaker cut into the closet, funky tuck and roll velour front seat covers, I'll stop here.  Price......$18,500.  Can be seen at:
