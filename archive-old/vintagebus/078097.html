Subject: RE: [VB] Original signwriting paint ?

  Any good automotive paint store should have ONE SHOT. This is for pin
stripping and sign painting and has been around as long as I can remember
(as far as the 70's when Shakey Jake pin stripped my  crusier)

Subject: [VB] Original signwriting paint ?


I'm about to signwrite my bus with an original style design and wondered 
what was the best paint to use.

I want to use cellulose, so that it dries hard enough in a couple of 
days so that I can buff the writing  to look faded and original, but 
figured that cellulose dries to quick to brush.  Oil/house paint will 
fix this but never really hardens enough to buff out with wet-n-dry.

Any suggestions ?
