Clara - for the most part, things are flat around here but there are sudden
drop-offs where several blocks have streets that are at enough of an incline
that in the winter, the ice will cause a car to slide down the hill.  I
don't think we have any super steep hills California style though.  I can
see how using the ebrake would really be plus in this area.  I stand
partially corrected on this oversight..
