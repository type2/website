be careful using any type of steel wool on chrome. I have had bad luck with
it-probably my fault as i was not using the finest steel sool they make.

I do know this-last spring when at a chroming place-this guy who has been
chroming things for a long time-even does stuff for NASA(not sure if that is
good or bad) told me never to use steel wool on my chromed parts.
