Subject: Re: engine out-must do's?(release fork)

Release fork/shaft:

I just bought a heavy duty kit from BugPack.  Included everything you
need: clips, spring, fork, bushing etc.
25$CDN...the fork is a truly massive and over-engineered piece.  the
arms are huge, go all around the
shaft and are wielded all the way around the shaft as well.

My old fork wore right thru virtually to the notch for the bearing clip
on one side.  Fortunately the
bearing gave out first telling me to get in there and fix it, and a
local junkyard owner/friend told me to replace the
fork while I was at it with a heavy duty unit so I had everything on
hand when engine pull time arrived.

I think JC Whitney sells the bugpack kit.  Its probably listed for early
beetle; check the Rocky catalog to find the
proper year you need (think its 67-71 bug if I recall).

...Markus
