Bryan,

First, you should use a mixture of sand and a softer media...walnut
shells, plastic, etc.  Or, you can use plastic media to get all the
paint and bondo out and then use straight sand for the rust spots.  Most
heavily rusted areas are in crevices or areas of some heft (strength).
Areas of rust on flat sheet metal like the nose or sides will usually be
cut out and patched anyway, so you don't need to use the coarse stuff
there.

Second, practice...practice...practice.  Try out your technique on some
scrap panel, you'll get a feel for when the paint and rust disappear
fairly fast.  Like the other post mentioned, adjust your technique to
what type of blaster and pressure you are using.  How big a compressor
are you going to use.  I wouldn't even think of using anything smaller
than a two stage, 60 gal, 5 horse power compressor.  18cfm min.  BTW
these are not portable.  Anything lighter, and you'll be blasting till
the year 2000.

Third,  Once it is blasted clean, prime it immediately with a good epoxy
primer or etch primer.  DO NOT use a brush, spray it.  That is, unless
you are going to use a brush to paint the top coat (what ever floats
your boat).  The epoxy is best if you are going to let it set for an
extended amount of time before you start working on it, or you will be
leaving it out in the weather.  Make sure you prep the metal with a
compatible metal etch/prep before you prime.  BTW the epoxy is not a
sanding primer.  It is just to seal the metal from the elements.  If you
are going to get at the body work fairly soon and will keep the shell
indoors while you work, the etch primer is fine.  You don't need to use
metal prep since the etch primer is going to etch (hence the name) the
metal and prime in one step.

These primers are TWO PART primers and need to be used with caution.
They contain isocyinates that can dramatically SHORTEN your life!  It is
recommended to use a positive pressure breathing hood or mask when
spraying these as well as any paint product containing isocyinates.  An
activated charcoal mask will NOT do the job adequately!  I know many
people don't use them, but its your lungs...how long do you want them to
last?

Living in Germany you should have many great paint products to choose
from.  The best in my opinion is BASF, maker of the Glasurit line.  They
make everything you need.  Be aware this stuff is not cheep.  Be
prepared to spend upwards of US $100 for a gallon of epoxy primer and
activator...maybe less.  Check with your local supplier.

Lastly, check out this web site.  It is by far the best automotive
refinishing site on the web.  The BBS will answer any question you
have.  Check the archives before you post.  Good luck with your
project!!
