Subject: Re: [VB] PLF highroof accident

So does a bus end up getting totaled after every Classic?  Last year, that
23-window rolled going back up to Oregon or Washington or wherever...

&gt; Just saw the photos of Dawns accident and the PLF highroof. Hope everyone
is
&gt; ok! It is a shame to see such a nice bus in that state. Lisa and I were
just
&gt; admiring it on Saturday. Anyone know what happened?
&gt;
&gt; Drive safe!!
