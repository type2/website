Subject: Re: [VB] vintage ev bus

Very nice bus Thom and when the new generation of hydrogen fuel cells get
cheap enough, you can drop one of them in there along with a hydrogen tank
and have the range of a gasoline powered bus, without the pollution.

&gt; Granted, this is not a vehicle for a driver who makes long trips, but it
&gt; makes a great commuter to and from work and for errands on the weekend.  The
&gt; upside of recharging is that it is cheap, $1.50 for those 49 miles, and even
&gt; including the cost of battery replacement, still cheaper than the 18 mpg
&gt; that I got on gasoline.
