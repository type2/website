 The Berg Cruise guys state you must be able to cruise 70 MPH and plus all
the way. As they say they don't mess around. They leave Thurs and we leave
Tues and they will probably pass us way before Portland. The VW buses will
leave from the Bakersfield KOA early Wed. morning and we will stay in
Redding at Wolfgang Int. Mike said there is a park with lake across from the
shop and we can camp in the parking lot or at one of the local low cost
campgrounds in the area. Anyway anyone wanting to join the slow bus cruise
 55/60  MPH max ) join us in Bakersfield Tues or Wolfgang Wed afternoon. We
still need a place to stay in Portland Thurs night. Anyone out there
volunteering a parking lot/ campgroung/ driveway for a few busses? We will
be using CB channel 15 for the cruise up. Need more info email me or leave
your phone number and I will call you as we get near you area .  Seeya,
VWHOWARD
