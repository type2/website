;Hello all,
;  OK, here's a problem that I bet none of you have to deal with!
;  I am 4'11&quot; tall and have a problem reaching the pedals.  I can either
;sit on the edge of my seat to reach them, or slide the seat up so far
;that the steering wheel crams into my stomach.  Does anyone have any
;suggestions on how to remedy this problem?
;Thanks! (no short jokes please, I've heard them all!)

When I was working as a helicopter machinist we had a similar problem.
We uses w2 velcro straps on a piece of 2X4 and raised the petal height
1.75 inches. It was easy to install and take off for other pilots.

Good luck
Gordon
