Went to my local Hastings and bought all 5 issues they had. It really looks
like they are on the right track for the best VW rag out there, a real
peoples mag. Had good articles and kept the talk short on the shows with
lots of pics and commentary, could use some more Bus stuff, but that will be
up to the people that read and respond to make it happen. Only a few large
ads and not all the discount whore ads like the other rags out there, hope
they keep it that way, they wouldn't even let me run a small ad in the
rebirth issue. So go out and check it out, if anybody has a problem finding
it LMK and I can find some issues out there or will call and get some in the
store.
