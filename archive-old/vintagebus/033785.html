Maybe I'm missing something here, so clear this up if I am. If you're
only using the tires to trailer the bus, why not get either; 1) the
right size for after it's been restored, or 2) any old thing that will
work, i.e. 195/50-15's... ??

Well, I got the tires to put on my rims, and the tire guy said that they
probably wouldn't work. The tires on the rims now, OG I think, are
5.6x15 low profile. Anyone think I am going to have problems with using
these rims with 205R7015 tires to trailer a bus? TIA A.J. Smith Fallon,
Nevada

Quick question:
I am getting 205/70R15 from a tire place to put on my '67 deluxe just to
move it from point A to point B to do more work. This should work,
right? I will probably trailer it, so it really shouldn't matter, right?
The first 10 respondants will earn my enduring respect and thanks! AJ
