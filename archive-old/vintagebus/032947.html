side yard (FrankieHill can attest to that!)&gt;&gt;

Yep, Thoms backyard looks like the WW all over again! Except no Kubels or KDF 
stamps! Just some rusty bus parts.
That panel had seen its last days.
And I'm sure if Thom offered it for 1500$ (Its value in parts!???) noone 
would even THINK to pay 1500 and ANOTHER 1500 to have it shipped to a 
location where its more desirable.
I've seen nicer busses get hit by the saw.
Rust free, collision free barndoor deluxes........butchered because &quot;It was 
kinda beat up, needed an interior&quot;
And a barndoor sunroof standard original paint/interior with LOGOS butchered 
because someone wanted the interior and another person wanted the 
bumpers!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!????
Im not one to talk, I've mutilated a few busses which SHOULD HAVE and COULD 
have been saved if the time and desire was there.
