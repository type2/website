&gt;hit the brakes for a yield sign.....thrphrmp!  First thing that poped into
my mind as I grabbed the e-brake was that the master cylinder went out!
(6 new w/c's, 4 rubber lines, yadeya) Old shoes though.  Pressed the pedal
again after I pulled over, and had about 1/4 of the brakes I should.

David,
        Glad to hear you finally got that engine together.  My '69 did the
same thing when the brakes werent adjusted down.  My tabs on the top of the
wheel cylinders had broken off...like all of them do when you try to screw
with them.  The brakes &quot;auto adjusted&quot; to such a far distance from the
drums that when I applied the brake they let the wheel cylinder lose
pressure.  I pulled the drum back off and adjusted em so tight that there
was a little resistance when spinning the wheel freely.  I even have an
emergency brake now.
