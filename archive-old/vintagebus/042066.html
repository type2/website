&gt; Wow - now that's a take that I'd never think of!  That could be a whole new
&gt; study..

A fairly short one, since the antisieze is squeezed out of the thread
contact area.  The non-contact area is normally filled with air which is
an excellent insulator (better than anti-sieze).  If anything, the plug
would run slightly cooler with anti-sieze.  I don't think that it would
make much difference, since the actual content of the thead area on a 
given engine varies anything from air to oil to carbon.
