Subject: Re: my poor 63
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 1998 23:22:32 PST


Well its raining as usuall in the Pacific Northwest. My 70 isnt ready 
for driving so my 63 can't come in the garage yet. I can wait to get it 
in there. The storm we have had is really putting the water into the 63. 
My front is leaking, my sides are leaking, and worse of all, my rear 
window is leaking. Just a little, but looking around the bus I see rust 
everywhere! Poor thing. I am really concerned about the rear hatch. Are 
there aftermarket hinges? Can I weld in metal into the lower part of the 
window? I have never taken glass out of an early window, so I hope it 
can be salvaged. The door I mean, not the glass, although I guess I want 
to salvage that too. Later model doors are of a double stamp metal 
variety, and when they rust, its problematic. Will I face these problems 
too?
Its sad to see this bus rust like this. Amazing the floors dont have 
any...Yet. Neither does the battery tray (original, my own little bit of 
joy).
Any pointers on the rear seals? And rust fix for the back door, and 
hinge?
Jason
