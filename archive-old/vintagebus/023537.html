  owners manual:

 Just a bit of info, I have both a '55 and a July, '57 owner's manual and
 they appear identical, as far as I can tell.  VW reused the '55 photos...
 
 What's a &quot;weird big cover intake manifold&quot;?
 
 I looked at the pics of the my '57 manual at:
 http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals57.htm
 and couldn't figure out what your statement meant.

look at page 11 of the 57 manual- there is a picture of checking the fan belt 
tension.  IN the 55 manual the same view is on page 10- only the intake 
manifold is the early 36hp style- used I think 54/55 only.  It has a big 
ballonish insulator thing surrounding it almost to the top of the neck on the 
intake.

It does not have a full view, but it definately is there and not the same as 
a later 36hp intake manifold. 

also - the 55 book I have shows the 36mm generator pulley nut, while the 57 
book has pictures with the 21mm gen pulley nut
