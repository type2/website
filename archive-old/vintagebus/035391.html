Subject: DD seat (PO of that seat!!!!!)

 Hi
   You all don't know me- for I have been a silent lurker of this list 'til 
now. 
    If I would have known what kinda trouble this DD seat would have caused- 
I would have kept it instead of selling it to Isaiah. I sold that DD seat to 
him DIRT CHEAP because I was under the impression that he was going to do 
nothing but use it in his own bus. He told me that a DD seat was his &quot;ideal 
seat&quot; because it was easier to get things out of the back of the bus, crawl 
around, etc. 
      I consider myself a true VW enthusiast; I sold a fellow VW owner 
something he could use (or so I thought)  for REALLY cheap to help him out. 
You think YOU guys feel burnt about seeing this DD seat for sale, (or for 
trade, for that matter) and all of the games that are going along with it? 
    I know, I know, I sold it and I shouldn't care what the new owner does 
with it. But sometimes you wonder about helping a fellow VW owner again? I 
don't mean to flame Isaiah- but at the same time this will go down as a great 
learning experience.
   Sign me,
    &quot;Regretfully regretting helping out&quot;
