&lt;&lt; but I was unable to obtain the required brackets.  I have no idea what 
they even look like. If anyone has some they would like to part with, or even 
a picture of one
 so I know what to look for I would be most grateful. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
There are at least three differant types of all steel bus roof racks and each 
has its own style of clamp.  We might be able to figure out which you need if 
you can send a photo of the roof rack you have.  Eric&amp;Barb
