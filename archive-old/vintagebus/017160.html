&gt; Do you have an estimate time I should wait or how many reservoirs 
&gt; full of 
&gt; fluid I should go for.  Eric&amp;Barb said something in the bench bleed 
&gt; post to 
&gt; take of both senders (have a dual Circuit MC) and plug them with my 
&gt; finders 
&gt; and pull down the brake pedal harm until MC forces fluid out??  Not 
&gt; sure if 
&gt; I understand that one,  it would seem the finger would be doing the 
&gt; same 
&gt; thing as the sender? 

I think they mean the fluid would force you fingers off.
If you MC was never bench primed then you may have a problem 
for get the gravity bleed for now
I wouldn't use my fingers unprotected as the fluid is pretty nasty stuff.
study a Bentley or chilton's and look at the cross section 
look at the possible ways you could prime this system.
If there is no fluid coming out of both your senders
then there's a good chance the thing isn't primed
the idea is to get both circuits working. this better done out of the bus

Thus &quot;Bench&quot; bleeding or priming
let the MC bleed out the sender holes then try the finger trick
I don't what kind of clearance you have under your bus as mine is a 61
with single system.
I haven't tried it but you may inject fluid into the sensor holes, 
get it primed anyway you can.
try it on the bus
failing that try a bench bleed.
bench bleed then plug all holes to keep prime 
and then install and bleed the whole system.
