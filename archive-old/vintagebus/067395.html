That depends on were you live. 50 Miles east of me I would be in the Pacific, 50 Miles West I would be in Stockton. So either way, at least for me, I'm sunk!  (Just kidding Stocktonites)

My point was that if it had the ability to cover more distance, it might be seen as more of a feasable alternative to ICE's,  rather than a novelty.
