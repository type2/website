Hi Dworkin,
It sounds like he is talking about the upper right mounting bolt that also 
mounts the upper side of the starter.  In that case it depends if the starter 
has cast into it's body the locking notches for the half moon head of the 
bolt.  We weld a nut to one side of the bolt head to prevent this loose 
turning on starters without the notches.  Doing this also locks the bolt from 
slipping forward if you rotate the bolt clockwise and lock the welded on nut 
in a groove on the side of the starter.
