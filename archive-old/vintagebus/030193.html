&gt; What's the difference between 'early' and 'late'?

I'm wondering if there's some conceptual confusion here:  belly pans 
(welded in between frame rails below cargo floor to strengthen body in 
westies, for example) and belly pans (bolted under the cab floor to 
cover underside of pedal cluster, gearshift base, etc.).

Perhaps the early/late comment referred to the latter?  I think the 
original poster was talking about the former.

But it does explain why many people told me 'good luck' when I said I 
was looking for a belly pan for my 65.  Who is reproing the cab-floor 
pan, BTW?

Joe
