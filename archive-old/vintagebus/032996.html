About a year ago at my friends wedding the &quot;limo&quot; was a lowered (VERY low) 23 
window bus.
It was POURING down rain and as they drove through a puddle water came up 
through the floor and FLOODED the cargo area. (Rusty floors!)
Should have heard the bride scream!!!!!!!

&quot;My first experience with Safari type windshields was with a Model A

Ford!!!&quot;



My first experience with the crank-out front windshield was a 39 Chevy 
Pick-up I

drove it on an off up till a few years ago, it had repop seals and it didn't

leak at all. I've never owned a VW that didn't leak. Its why the engineers 
added

the built in towel bar on all models (I mean grab bar)
