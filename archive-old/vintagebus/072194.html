Subject: Re: bus jams

&gt; From: craig k &lt;vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org&gt;
&gt; i finally bit the bullet and bought a used ipod with an accessory  fm
&gt; transmitter unit.

The audio-out jack on the iPod will hook up to one of those cassette 
adapters, too, if you want to avoid RF.  It's a standard 3-conductor 
miniplug.  Or even better, if you have no radio or cassette player, 
just buy one of those inexpensive (under $100) graphic eq/amps with a 
mini jack (Realistic used to have them but others sell 'em -- see 
JCWhipme) and plug the iPod directly into that.  Your bus becomes a 
portable accessory powered amp and external speakers for your iPod. :)

My bus has a factory radio blockoff, and a yard-sale am/fm/cassette 
unit sitting on the parcel tray.  Output runs through the eq/amp to 
speakers in the upper front corner of the doors (nice stereo 
separation) and under the rear seat (for good bottom), and sound is 
pretty decent, though a tad wimpy for highway cruising unless I crank 
it and attenuate the bass a little so as not to shred the speakers.  
The eq has 7 bands, IIRC, which is really plenty for fiddling in a 
noisy old bus.  It's mounted below the parcel tray to the left of the 
steering wheel.

The eq has a front panel mini jack that I plug my portable CD player 
into, no muss, no fuss.  It has I think 45-sec antishock, which does 
pretty well, though I do get skips on rough roads.  And my wife won't 
let me just take her iPod with me.  Unreasonable woman.
