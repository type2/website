First off, sorry about the new micorbus post, I've been out of the loop for
a while. however, its great to see all the replies! 

On that note, I am looking to repair some fender damage on my 63 deluxe. It
is in resto-mode, so now is the time to do it. Anyone know of good/
trustworthy body shops in the east bay of the San Francisco bay area, to do
the work? I know of Lavere's, but is there any other?

Thanks,  

Seth Haynes
