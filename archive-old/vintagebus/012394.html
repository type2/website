Subject: Re: rocker problems on rebuild (Summary)

I believe I've solved my 'plaint of a few days ago, wherein #1 
exhaust rocker had zero lash against the valve stem.  I bought .030 
shims at the FLAPS and installed them.  Got a gap now.  I've read 
and understand the concerns about geometry.

Thanks again to the many helpful folks on the bus, ghia, and 
vintagevw lists who responded with suggestions, all of which were 
worthwhile:

- foreign matter between the pushrod and lifter
- trim the offending pushrod to length
- check valve stem heights (mine were equal) and castigate the 
valve job guy if they're off - could mean a bad seat
- engine not rotated to correct position
- inconsistent lifter head thicknesses or reground cam problem
- variations in T4 castings (a hydraulic lifter issue, not relevant to 
me)
- email Bob Hoover or Eric and Barb (Veewee) 
[Thanks, Cal! :-)]

...among several others.  I also searched the 
Hoover CD and the excellent type2_dot_com library 
for info.

Shims on a stock setup scare some, while other 
respondents said no problem.  I'll post back if 
this turns out to be a continuing issue.

The lists and the people on them are great!!
