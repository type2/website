Subject: '63 camper for sale (Oregon)

Hi. My girlfriend is now selling her camper in Eugene, Oregon. It's a 
1963 kombi, with non-westy camper interior. New brakes, tires, fresh 
tune-up &amp; oil change. recent rebuild on motor, very sound mechanical 
shape overall. Mostly solid body, with some rust in the rockers. Overall 
a good solid bus for someone who wants to be driving and enjoying a 
splitty camper now. Asking price is $2500, which is negotiable. 
E-mail me for more information, viewing the bus, etc.
thanks...
