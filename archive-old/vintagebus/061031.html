Subject: Re: [VB] oil pump question

I had the same problem with mine when I installed an
external oil filter. I took my degree pulley to a
local machine shop and had the back side of the pulley
machined down as thin as they could get it. Put it
back on and it cleared the engine tin after that. Hope
that helps.

&gt; &lt;&lt; does anyone know if it is safe to run an external
&gt; oil cooler with a stock 
&gt; oil pump that is properly blocked off?  i have a
&gt; high volume pump, but with 
&gt; the pump cover on i cant get a pulley to clear it. 
&gt; i have tried a stock, 
&gt; empi, and scat pulley and none of them will clear
&gt; the nuts that hold the full 
&gt; flow cover on.  i cant put my studs in any further,
&gt; so i wanna try it with a 
&gt; stock pump.  i have been told it can be done safely,
&gt; but would like other 
&gt; opinions as well.  thanks!

&gt; Is it the nuts that are pushing the tin out from the
&gt; case which then hits the 
&gt; pulley?   Or is it the studs sticking through the
&gt; nuts?   You can grind off 
&gt; the end of the studs and that'll clearance it
&gt; enough.  BTDT. I think you only 
&gt; need to grind down two of the studs. 
&gt; better to have a heavier oil pump if you are going
&gt; to run a cooler and/or 
&gt; filter.
