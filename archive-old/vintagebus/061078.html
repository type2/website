Subject: Westy hitch parts (Do you need any?)

Looks like selling repro westy hitches will not be
viable.  They will cost too much for what the market
will pay.

I am probably going to make some of the parts for my
own use.  Is anyone in need of the following?  I could
probably make a few extra's.  Not sure of the cost yet
though.

Westy &quot;U&quot; bolts
Westy Electrical mount plate
European Electrical Socket  (Part that is on the
hitch)
European Electrical Trailer plug (Part on the trailer)
Westy Bumper mount backing plate

Thanks
Matthew
