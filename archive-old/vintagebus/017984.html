actually it is a digital voltmeter, i just put a brand new battery in it, as i
had previously left it on for a few months while my bus was in storage. but i
will check to see that i installed the battery all the way in, it is a 9 volt
battery.

&gt;reading it gets is double, it doesn't actually double the voltage of the
&gt;battery.  anyone have any idea why this would happen? this is the second
voltmeter i
&gt;have had go bad on me,

Kevin? Just a guess on my part...
If you have a digital voltmeter, as would indicate accurate to 1 decimal..
then I *think* you may have a dead battery in the meter ,,,  I have seen
this the cause many times,,, as the battery gets low,, the readings go up..

If it is an analogue meter,, are you sure your looking at the correct scale
for the range your on?
this is also a very common mistake. to read the scale for 30 volts,, when
your on the 300 volt range.
