Subject: fuel pump rebuild
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the other day I was looking at the 1600sp motor in my 65 westy.I noticed that 
the fuel filter had more crud in it than I like, and proceeded to remove it 
for replacement.   Then fuel started dripping out of the line from the pump.  
just dripping out under gravity feed from the tank.

Odd, I thought, it's never done that before.

This isn't right, I thought.  What does that do to the actual fuel delivery?

plugged the line into the pump and removed it.   dumped the gas out of it, 
and I could blow easily through the pump, hm, no wonder it dripped.  It was 
one of the non rebuildable kind.   Went through my box of fuel pumps, and 
looked for a rebuildable one that you could not blow through.   Ended up 
taking a bunch apart.   the bolt on the face pointing to the rear has a 
filter behind it.  Clean that out w carb clean.   take the top off and clean 
out the bowl ditto.  Take the hat of the top and peel back the pump do hickey 
and ditto. (was cheap and reused the old bits in the pump, they looked okay)  
Check the one way valve so it doesn';t leak past.  make sure it's all very 
clean, reassemble, mush lotsa clean grease into the base where the push rod 
activates the pump, and install w new gasket.

Now my bus idles higher.  think I better re tune and adjust carb.

I didn't know that fuel pumps could go bad that way.  it's funny how you can 
drive ACVWs w/ uprights for years and still run into new tweeks.
