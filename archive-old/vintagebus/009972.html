Wow, Pomona was wet.  I got there about 6, walked around for a while, no
umbrella, everything was fine.  Got a little heavier later and I ended up
hurtin' by 9.  Weak turnout but I picked up a VW-stamped single-tip exhaust
and a few other trinkets.  Some deals were there, a set of original safaris
for $200, missed those.  2 nice cab dividers, $100 each, let them pass.

I had the privilege of viewing a project '60 hatchtop Westy and a POS '60
Double Door Kombi on Saturday afternoon.  The double door was somebody's
crack head project, glass view portals cut in the roof, hacked in extra
taillights, missing front bulkhead, scary stuff.  Not much rust though.

Bye,
