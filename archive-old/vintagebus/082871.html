&gt;   We are changing our brake fluid in our buses over to silicon brake fluid


you might want to REALLY research that... fer instance, bob adler, 
dean of old ch*vy truck gurus, HATES silicon fluid in older systems. 
for one thing, if you use it, water simply collects in the system and 
rusts it out. regular brake fluid absorbs the water, and when you 
flush, removes it from the system. if you TRULY plan to flush, tear 
down and replace parts on a yearly schedule, do it - but most people 
forget.  the basic premise i read is that modern high-performance 
cars might benefit (and have systems designed for that specific 
fluid), but most of us would be  getting involved in a false 
economy.....
