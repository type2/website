Well,

It is a throw back to the shows of the 80's.  Cal look and all.  Used to
have bikini contests and all (best part I think).  Mostly custom, but has
its fair share of vintage and off road.  Lots of water pumpers too...runs
the gamut.  The bad part for me was the price $$$$.  That and the swap is
usually not that hot, with people hiking up the prices just to break even.

Just my two cents though.
