&gt; PCNA got spanked by PAG for sending out $1000 off Boxster coupons
&gt; to the entire PCA membership.  The used 996 market has all
&gt; but collapsed, with even '00MY cars having lost 50% of their
&gt; value.  Mid-high mileage 993's can be had for the upper 20's now,
&gt; which were north of $80k new!

Seems as though they might have been a wee bit overpriced when new?  I
don't see similar things happening to Hondas.
