Wow I guess this is where we agree to disagree.  You, obviously have to feel
this way..... you are in the &quot;business&quot; of restoring busses.  If you don't
you're out of business.  That's cool.  As has been said, with out the attention
and interest in this make/model people would not invest in producing
reproduction parts,  thus making it harder for everyone to restore what ever
they are working on.   Value = parts.

On the other hand, I have a philosophical problem with restoring these things
just to force the value sky high.  Only  a very small few will become rich off
of the hobby due to this.  But hey, that's America right?  Supply and demand?
OK.

Where will ethics play a roll in this valuation?  It appears that unscrupulous
people are already trying to capitalize on this &quot;through the roof&quot; valuation
(the $14,999 Deluxe with no interior comes to mind).  Do people think this will
get better the higher the prices go?  I think it will get much worse.  Greed is
a powerful thing....no??   Famous paintings are faked all the time....some are
worth millions.

My point is, for most of us out here this is NOT a business.  It is a hobby...
usually a part time escape from the grind of daily working stress.  A chance to
forget life in the 21st century (well almost) and jump in our rolling time
machines to feel, well, different than everyone else.  Most don't have dedicated
shops with multiple bays full of parts, tools and  busses awaiting restoration
and shipment to the next 7 figure income customer.  Most have 2 car garages
filled with one project pushing 5 years and possibly a few more till completion.

Don't get me wrong.  EVERYONE has a right to do what they want!  Hack away,
drive daily, restore and show, restore and sell.   Hell, sell every bus you find
to Japan  if you want.  Just remember to not complain when the values are so
high the only people in the game are the people at the top of the food chain.
Money talks, and in our financially obsessed culture IT controls
everything....even your beloved hobby/lifestyle.   How many people who used to
be in the 356 hobby were still in it when the values (real or imagined) went to
50K + ?   The rich ones that's who.

Hey, I'm stepping down off the ivory box for now.   Again this is not a slam on
those in the &quot;biz&quot; just an opposing view point.  God I love America!  :-)
