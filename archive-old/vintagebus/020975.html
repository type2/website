Well, lessee...

(scroll down to find Barndoor listing under Bar and
Dance clubs...if you go I don't want to know about it)

(scroll down to the B section to find the Barndoor
Drive-in Restaurant)

http://www.doubledoorinn_dot_com/1.html (I wouldn't mind
taking in some of the entertainment offered here)

http://www.doubledoor_dot_com/ (Think I'll pass on the
entertainment here)

Goose eggs on Sunroof and Slammed Panel, however...

(look under Bars/Clubs for Westfalia)

That's all the time I have for now, besides, it's not Friday!
