Hey Folks,

Long time no hear, eh?  Well let me tell you what's been goin on over here
in St. Louie...

I've spent all of last week building up a 1600sp motor for my Westy (64
hatch-top) from the engine it originally came with when I bought it about a
year ago.  Up till this point, I'd been running an 'over the counter'
rebuilt 1600dp.  There was noting wrong with that motor, I just don't like
Dual-Ports..  ;-)

So, I spent all week scrubbing, sanding and painting tin; bought new Dansk
heat exchangers, installing new seals, adapting an alternator tot he motor,
getting together all the flaps and thermostat stuff, etc.  At the end of it
all, I've got the most anally-assembled motor I've ever built.  All tinwork
complete, even got me the seals that go around the fresh air ducts...
working thermostat, well, you get the picture.

Her maiden voyage on the new engine was to be a run out to Kansas City for a
swap meet on Sunday.  Saturday evening I head out west, and right away
notice something amiss...

My dual-port motor used to run about 450 degrees on the heads, and 220
degrees on the oil... at least according to the gauges..  remember I had to
lengthen the wires to the head temp gauge, right?   But my 'new' SP motor I
was running 260 on the oil, pushin 600 on the heads, and had absolutely NO
top-end power..  even the slightest of inclines presented a problem and I'm
only getting about 17mpg.  HOLY TEMPERATURES BATMAN!!!   Man, don't touch my
dipstick, cause it will KILL you!

So, OK, I AM pushing a 50mph headwind, and I just learned that all my tires
were about 10lbs low on air...  plus I'm using an 009 dizzy with a
Compu-Fire.  On the way home, with a 50mph or so tail-wind.. I did a little
better on the hills, oil temps were 220 degrees (at least where the DP ran)
but head temps were still sky-high!

Tonight I changed back to the vac-advance dizzy (with Compu-fire) from the
old DP, check time, tune carb, and go for a test run.   Oil temps ran 180,
heads read 350... ran smooth...  That was at least, until I got on the
highway....

Once I got on the highway, it was a challenge just to get up to 55mph, head
temps skyrocketed up to near 600 degrees, but oil stayed cool..  only during
the worst of the head temps did the oil get up to 220 deg.  I got off the
highway, and my temps dropped VERY quickly...  heads went down to about
350-400, oil down to 210... and stayed there through much city driving.

I live about 1 mile from the highway, and by the time I got back into the
driveway, temps were cool..  I could hold the dipstick without worry, and
the intake manifold was only warm to the touch... very nice...

But what concerns me folks are those ultra-high readings on the highway, and
my lack of top-end power...   the motor has good compression, is very peppy
on the git-go, runs very cool on city streets... what should my temps be
reading to begin with?  I know I should have more top-end...  when I drove
the bus home after I bought it, the motor pushed it along at 65 without
complaint....

BTW, it has an internal 8mm oil cooler (no doghouse here buddy!),
later-model fan w/alternator, stock crank pulley.  I time it statically at 5
BTDC with the vac-advance dizzy.  The plugs look great, and the carb tunes
out perfectly..  it idles and starts beautifully.

So what does the collective think?  Timing?  Advance curve issue?  Stealth
intake leak? (I've checked already as best I could),  Could my thermostat be
adjusted wrong?

I need to know quick because I'm supposed to leave Tuesday morning on an
1,800 mile road trip to my mom's house in Alabama, Dave Easterwoods in
Georgia, and finally end up at the Type 2 camp-out in North Carolina.  I
need help before I arrive at Dave's with melted heads!  LOL..

Thanks in advance for ANY ideas...

-Brian
