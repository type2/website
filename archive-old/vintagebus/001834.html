Hey Volks

Some of you may remember my VWSA rebuilt 1600SP with excessive end float. I
last reported that Remtec, the company that rebuilds engines for VWSA on a
sub-contract, had agreed to replace the engine under guarantee.

I called the production manager there today as I hadn't heard anything for a
few weeks. When I asked about progress, there was an embarrassed silence
suggesting he'd forgotten all about it, then he said there had been a
problem with their supply of rebuildable casings. This after I had made it
clear to him that I wasn't going to accept another engine that had been
align bored beyond spec.

Then, as we were talking on the phone, he said: &quot;Oh, what's this ... here's
a pallet of brand new cases ... they must have just arrived.&quot;

He ascertained that they are new Brazilian cases. I asked if it would be
possible for him to build my engine using one of them, he replied that he
would have to find out, as they might be destined for &quot;export engines&quot;. When
I asked where they export rebuilt engines with new cases, he said to the
United States.

So which US VW parts suppliers are selling VWSA rebuilt engines??? And how
much do they cost? How much does a new Mexican engine cost in the US?

In a previous conversation with the Remtec man, he had said they can no
longer afford to import new cases as it has become too expensive. The VW
dealers sell their crappy rebuilds (mine had been align-bored so much that
the pulley boss was 0,5mm oversize) for the equivalent of about US$600.
