WoW!!! It looks like 2000 started with this going back to the '60's kind
of thing. I've seen some new designs for home deco and stuff on HGTV and
they are definitely '60's man. HEY!!! Have you guys seen this commercial
with a splittie and a new Toyota? Who's baby was it? I mean a Micro?
Who's bus was in that commercial? It was great! If they think that Toyota
is going to be the new &quot;Bus&quot; or a &quot;Bug&quot; they're wrong. But using a Bus in
that commercial was cool I think.

Just a thought,
