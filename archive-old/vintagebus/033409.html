Subject: How to time at full advance?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Wanted to ask again how to time at full advance. I've read the archives and 
see that I need a timing analyzer. I take it I can't do it with a standard 
strobe light. Is this correct?

I've got a vacume advance disty and a 34 PICT carb.

So do I rev the engine to 3000 RPMS and time at 28-30 BTDC ? How do I 
figure out where on the pulley that 28-30 mark is?

Since I've got a '75 FI case, with a 34 PICT carb, and a vacume advance 
disty from a 60's model vehicle (can't seem to figure out what it actually 
is) , I'm just not sure where to time at idle.  So I figure the best 
solution is to time at full advance and let it be where it's gonna be. Does 
this sound right?

A nice to the point and simple explanation of the procedure would help 
tremendously. As well as what I need to look for in a timing analyzer (if I 
need on that is). I've read enough of &quot;how disty's work&quot; in the archives. 
So I'm not really looking for a discussion (or debate) on that. Thanks for 
the help.
