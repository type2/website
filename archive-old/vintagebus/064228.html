Subject: Re: [VB] My pics are up - engine Q's

| Well, fix them now not later!  You are ripe for a fuel fire.  The engine is
| getting dirt in it, and running 30F hotter due to these mighty engineering
| screw ups by the DPO.
|
| &gt;&gt;1500? I was told this is a 1600.... I need to get dirty... &lt;&lt;
|
| Looks like you have stale air 40HP rear engine tin since there is no fresh
| air tube holes through.  Of course this had to be cut to fit the 1500 and
| later engine (IDed by the intake manifold pipes where it seals to the heads.)
| you have.  Of course you could have anything from a 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600,
| 1641,1688, or even a 1776cc engine depending on stroke of crank and piston

as far I know (checked numbers) this is a B case 1600 engine built between December 1969 and July
1970 .... it's been modified but I might modify it a little further. Change a few things. It won't
be driving in Arizona anymore and I'm gonna need some heat.

Thanks,
