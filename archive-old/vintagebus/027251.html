When my bus is at home....it sits outside as if I was to try to go into the
garage....it'd rip the roof right off the bus because the garage is far too low
to get into.  But a lot of the time the bus is at the shop getting minor things
done to it....and that bay is tall enough for a semi...so no problems there :)
At my old house after I just got my roof rack (a nice full length one :) I came
home real late and was tired and forgot that I had a roof rack....I almost
drove right into the garage...but I remembered and stopped about 2&quot; before I
smacked the top of the garage....PHEW! that was close!
