Yes! New Old Stock. In fact, you don't really need the &quot;new&quot;, it's just old
stock. Leftover stock. Stock that wasn't used. Stock that's been hiding
somewhere for the last so many years, &quot;just an old VW part that hasn't been
used yet.&quot; Not stock that has been remanufactured; not stock that's been
cleaned up - the good old original stock.

Well, that's just how I take it, of course.

&gt; Well, for the last 15 years that I have been drooling over NOS parts ( a
few
&gt; friends' inventory come to mind), I have always known NOS to mean exactly
&gt; that:   New Old Stock.
&gt;
&gt; Now, new old stock always meant a Factory VW part, no longer available,
that was
&gt; found somewhere in an old VW Dealer parts room.  NOS would not carry the
same
&gt; mystique if it was just an old VW part that hasn't been installed yet.
