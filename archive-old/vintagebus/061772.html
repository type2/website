Subject: Should I cut up a bus?...

I have been trying to keep my mouth shut on this, but I guess mailing
lists are all about controversy and different opinions. I would take the
straight rust free double door over a 23 window or Westy any day. Your
post is very interesting because you go through a long dissertation why
you should cut up this bus. Then you ask our opinion and lastly you
state that it is your bus so you can do what you want with it. If you
truly believe that it is your bus so you could do what you want, why ask
for opinions from us? I dont like the idea of cutting up a really nice
bus. I also enjoy the hunt for parts. It took me 4 years to collect the
parts just to get my 57 23 window on the road. As you stated yourself it
is not about me, it is your bus do what you want but why tell a whole
list about it if your mind is already made up? This isn't meant to be
mean, I just see this type of post on a few different lists and have
wondered why spend the time writing a post asking opinions about
something you are already decided on? Anyway good luck with your
decision and either way I hope your project comes out like you want.
Craig
