Subject: Did you recently buy gas in your 59 pickup in Moses Lake???

Hi All,

 

My Aunt who lives in Moses Lake WA just sent me an email about them
meeting this guy in a gray VW pickup at a Chevron station in Moses Lake.
She said my uncle talked with the guy and for some reason the guy knew
of me and the tipper.. 

 

Was this anybody on this list???

 


David
