During removal?

Actually, I've seen a couple spots on the tubes where there were small
cracks and openings, like at weld seams, and I remember one spot with a
cutout thingie that something attached to.  Even more so if your tube
is rusty and the venturi effect of all that hot air rushing through it
pulls cold air in from the outside, and with it fibers from the jacket.
(Elvis had this problem on his bus.)
