hey, I have a 67 deluxe and I am having problem with first and second gear
along with reverse.  It is incredibly hard to find first and at a stopped
position you have to use way to much force to get it in gear.  Although, if
you are moving at 5 mph, then it slides into first with no problem.  Second
is just very rough and you hear a loudish click when it finally gets in
gear.  Reverse is bad too because every time I try and put it in reverse, it
screeches and sounds like crap, like the grooves are still spinning.  And if
I try to force it into reverse sometimes it kicks it out of gear.  Third and
fourth are like a dream compare to these three, so if anyone has any
helpfull advice, I would love to hear from you.   Thanks for your time,

well, have you inspected the shift linkage?   particularly the rer couple
just forward of the trans?   should be nice a tight, no wiggle betwwen the
bits it connects.  check the archives for more on this.

you may have a mickey mouse shift linkage

 you may also have the front shift plate somewhat out of place

could perhaps have a clutch problem.

you may have a problem inside the tranny  (ick)

is this sudden?  or did you just get the bus?

   Have you changed the gear oil?  if not in the past year, do so .   Drive
the bus to warm it up, park it on a nice flat surface and put your cap on and
have rags handy.    put a oil pan under the center section and undo the two
17mm allen plugs.  Check the boots- one each side of tranny.  if they are
torn or cracked replace them.     Pull the parking brake and crack loose all
the back lug nuts.    block one back wheel and the cross front one front and
back, and jack up the othe rrer wheel, pull the rim off,   undo the plugs top
and bottom and drain the oil out of the RGBox.    If you only have one drain
pan wait till the center just barely drips, put the plugs back in  (you
cleaned the metal off them right) and us ethe pan for the RGB oil.   Put the
drain plug in and fill it .   till it bubbles.  spin the wheel and fill it a
bit more.  repeat other side.   Last fill the center section.  Leaving the
gear oil (you have a gallon of it for this) in the sun or a bucket of warm
water helps, though I always forget.

 What is in the oil?  Big crusty chunks?   magnetic shavings?   brass
shavings?   Sludge?  All?  No oil?    Ideally it is a bit dirty but no metal
or just a smidge of shavings on the magnets.  often the magnets look furry on
a trans that has not had regular changes.   If the oil is chunky scoop the
sludge out of the trans with you finger.  brass is the synchros wearing.

Betcha a donut if drives a bit better w/ clean gear oil.
