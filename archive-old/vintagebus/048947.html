I saw last week on the Type2_dot_com Buy &amp; Sell page a rear seat box for sale, $100.00.  I'm not sure if it included the seat backrest and bottom, but it's worth a call.  Maybe the seller will donate the whole enchilada.

If you don't have Internet access let me know and I'll get you the sellers name and address.  I have a '62 Double Cab that I'm parting out so if you need anything else let me know, I might still have it.  And don't worry folks, you know I wouldn't just part out any Double Cab.  This thing was the rot monster from hell.  There's more metal missing on the frame that what's there.  I think the only things holding it up are the front and rear axles.
