Subject: Jailbars

I have a '63 15 window deluxe and have found a complete set of jailbars 
on a 13 window.  I was trying to figure out they would work in my 63 and 
get the corner bars to go with it.  I haven't been able to get inside 
the bus to check it out and do not want to drag it home if they are not 
going to work on my bus. Would they work on my bus?   Thanks!  Kevin
