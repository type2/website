&gt;&gt;&gt;If any wire can be gotten to through the botton, securely wrap the
&gt;&gt;&gt;new wire to the old, making sure you can fit it through the hole in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the bottom of the column.  &gt;

&gt;Working inside the cab,

(snippity doo dah)

&gt;Gently pull the original wire from the bottom

(Snippity ay)

Geez, I must have been doing this wrong all these years, but I have never
put it in from the top, you have to allow for the curvature of the Earth,
windage and elevation, and then it hits a shoulder a few inches down,
besides, there ain't no a/c in these things anyway. Lay underneath it where
there's some ventilation. I take some number 14 or 12 wire and shove that
mother straight up from the bottom. Ain't never had to do it twice, and have
never had to resort to all of these appliances to get it in. Of course you
have to be real careful to hold your tongue right during this procedure. I'm
sure now I was lucky, but I did my 63 (RIP), my 59 single,  my 67
Westfailure, and this years Jerome raffle bus that way. Curiouser and
curiouser.....And you would think that gravity would be on the side of those
doing it from the top side. It sounds like a real bear to do and I think I'd
rather pack CV joints if it were like all that. Right, well carry on then,
I'm off to Jerome tomorrow to see which mystery bus VanBondo shows up in.
I'll either see you there or I won't.....
