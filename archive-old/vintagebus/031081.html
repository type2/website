Perhaps that new undercoating remover kit, Under Gone, from the Eastwood
Company might help.  There was an article about it in the July 2001
issue of VW Trends, although the website
(http://www.eastwoodcompany_dot_com/) doesn't seem to cover it.

&gt;   I've got that spray on bed liner stuff on the bed of
&gt; my &quot;new&quot; DC, I'm planning on going back to the dove blue
&gt; with oak slats, but I don't know how to get that stuff
&gt; off, any suggestions? I'm sure its going to be a royal
&gt; PITA since it was made to not come off!
