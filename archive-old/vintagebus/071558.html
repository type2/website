Subject: Re: [VB] Oil opinions

----- Original Message -----

&gt; I'm sure that this has been covered at some point but I just need opinions
&gt; about using various oil grades
&gt;
&gt; What do people think about using 10-30 or 20-50 oil?
&gt;

Depends on how 'loose' your motor is. If you can run 10w30, and still
maintain oil pressure at idle while fully warmed up, going to a thicker oil
will just cause more wear.

The ideal oil weight for the engine is as thin as you can go, without
tripping the oil pressure light at idle fully warmed up.

I run 5w30 in mine. Never had the oil light come on, even after numerous
long distance drives with the bus fully loaded.
