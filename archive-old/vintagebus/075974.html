&gt; I think any of us would first suggest I-84 along the Columbia River, but 
&gt; how about from Seattle? From Portland?

Hi Wes&amp;Wendy,
All routes are fine and at the same time have thier own challenges.  IE, I-84 
along the Columbia has really fierce winds which depending on which way you 
are traveling can be a head wind or tail wind and in the turns either way can 
slam one around if you do not pay attention.  At the same time this route will 
most likely be open when all the other passes up and down the West coast are 
snowed closed.  BTDT!!  Best advice is not to fear these challenges, but as 
always to keep your wits about you, and your mind on the road when driving.  This 
to us should to be common sense, but common sense seems to be so uncommon in 
fellow drivers we all too often have close encounters with.
