Subject: Re: [VB] prepping sump plates gaskets

From: &quot;craig&quot;
&gt; in an effort to slow the leaks on the aluminum crapcase, i've been 
&gt; painting the oil sump plate gaskets with gasgacinch... but it usually 
&gt; makes the dang things stick to case and plate, requiring scraping next oil 
&gt; change.  what else have you folks tried?  i'm thinking maybe a gasket 
&gt; shellac?
&gt;
&gt;
I saturate them with bearing grease before fitting. It seems to stop the oil 
seeping, and the gaskets come off easily at oil change time.
