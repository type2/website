Subject: Re: [VB] Paint Job

The Bug was painted first White---and shaded in with a standard
gun---with the orange and Blue--and then straight unreduced paint was
spit on top of that--low air pressure--no reducer will give you that
spider-web effect--

Later,

Terry

[VB] Paint Job
I have looked at about a billion pictures of paint jobs and was
undecided on what I wanted ... UNTIL I SAW THIS !!! This is the paint
that I want .. Problem is .. I don't have a CLUE how they did it or
where to start. I am thinking it is done with an airbrush .. Don't know
how they got those dark lines though .. anyway .. I LOVE IT .. Now I
just need to figure out how to do the same to my bus. appreciate any
clues ...
