&lt;&lt;This radio is in excellent condition and is a rare find. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Actually this model is one of the easiest to find though what you have looks 
to be in great condition.  Used between 1955-60 in the bus.

&lt;&lt;There is no guarantees on the working condition of the radio, but I believe 
that it operates just fine. &gt;&gt;
Oh please!  Unless you are some kind of electronic faith healer, just state 
that you do not know!  Foil type Condensors unlaminate and many other parts 
can and will go bad due to age/corrosion.  Plus this is a tube type radio, 
which tubes are well known to go bad at any time.  Even with the later 
Sapphire radios from the 1960s being all transistor if you by good condition 
used, but unknown radios of this type you are lucky to get a working one out 
of buying ten.
