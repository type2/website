&lt;&lt; I have read a couple of post that have made comments on single port heads
as
 they talk about other things.  I am curious.  The first comment was something
 like SP heads are better for low end torque Vs DP head....or something like
 that.  The second comment was that SP head are more durable.  Can someone
give
 me a quick SP Vs DP head head.  Any insight is appreciated.

Hi Steve,
Yes the single port heads are more durable than the stock dual port heads.
The stock dual port heads are too thin between the valves and spark plug.
Which leads to cracks in the heads when either they are cooled unevenly when
the engine is shut down to quickly after having been driven hard and/or when
detonation occurs in the cylinders.  Which is why Claudes Buggies went to VW
of Brasil to have them modify some of the stock castings to produce the CB441
and the CB442 (Someone please correct us if we got anything in this sentence
wrong please due to us working from our memory.) one of which having the stock
sized valves and the other having larger sized valves.  Both requiring longer
spark plugs to reach into the combustion chamber that now has a thicker area
between the spark plugs and the valves in these nonstock aftermarket heads.
On top of the thickness problem dual port is also the fact that the single
port engine has three gaskets between the carb and the heads on the intake
manifold.  The dual port with single carberator has an extra two rubber seals
than the single port system that when they crack cause that side of the engine
to lean out the fuel air mixture and melt down that head.   
   The question you should more be asking is which is better for you.  Well
that matters more on what you want and can afford in not only $, but time.  If
you are going to run a 1641cc or smaller engine between the stock RPMs of
1,500-3,000 with occasional short times of 3,500 RPMS then the differance
between the HP ratings between the single port and the dual ports are only 2-4
HP apart.  On the other hand if you want to do 0-60MPH in the quickest time
and the heck with the MPG and longevity of the engine.  Then you will expect
to run up to 5,500RPM and will need a header muffler dual port heads with
bigger valves, probably dual carberator set up and maybe a racing cam.  Which
is when it would be a good idea to use the aftermarket CB heads of either the
stock sized valves or the larger vales that cost more money.  In other words
the faster the engine RPM the faster and more you have to not only supply the
fuel/air mixture, but also the faster and more you have to remove the exaust
gasses.
    In the end if you are looking for higher HP and thus bigger than a 1641cc
for better hill climbing and longevity you should take a good look at the type
4 engine in a upright configuration.  It gets 200,000 miles easliy on a
rebuild in later 800lbs. heavier buses (Post-1967) and due to the longevity
ends up costing the less per mile than the old type 1&amp;2 engines that you would
have to rebuild at least twice to come near the same longevity of the type 4
in the bus.     Eric &amp; Barb
