&gt;&gt; The best battery you can buy is an Optima. They're a little hard to

&gt;&gt;From what I understand these are great batteries.  The fact that they
&gt;are sealed (I think) is another plus.

&gt;I didn't mention them because, as you mentioned, they are pretty hard
&gt;to find.
&gt;

They are pretty widely available in both 6 and 12 volt form here in Phoenix.
Don't know if it's still the case, but they were distributed by Interstate
battery dealers and could be gotten by any Interstate dealer that wanted
them. Very nice because they don't gas and they can supposedly be mounted
upside down, if need be. S'posed to work even if a rock takes a big old
chunk out of the case, for you baja bus people. Have owned two, never gave
the battery a second thought after installing them. Seem to crank forever,
even below freezing.
