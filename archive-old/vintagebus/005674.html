&gt; Ronnie  just wondering if anybody is still out there.
&gt;

Hey, Ronnie, et al...

I'm still here (that makes two of us:  Michele and myself), and we've just
been lurking....I've been working every single day with a few 1/2- day
exceptions, for nearly two months (there goes the summer!)

When I resurface, I'll be ripping into that tranny swap and engine rebuild
project for our camper Clara, as we have sincere plans to see you at Jerome!

Rest assured, I'll be using more than my share of bandwidth again!

Viva la Liste!

Gene
