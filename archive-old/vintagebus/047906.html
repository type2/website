Does anyone have access to doing searches of VIN numbers to see who a 
vehicle was last titled to and in what state? I've kinda run into a 
brick wall as far as the Florida DMV and the police are concerned. I 
called the local police and they couldnt come up with any info. Now if I 
put a tag on the vehicle and get stopped, I will get a ticket because it 
will come back as not registered...BUT...they cant tell me WHO it was 
last titled to. Its a shame that its easier to do it illegally than it 
is to do it properly !!

be careful when you get a bus w/o title.

info like you want is rarely given to the general public.

In Wa state it is possible to get a title to an abandoned vehicle-   it must
be inspected by the state patrol, then you take their piece of paper to the
DOL, send a registered letter to the last titled owner, if they don't respond
within 2 weeks you can get a temporay title, which becomes  reglar title in
three years.   If the PO shows up within the three years, he/she can reclaim
the vehicle, but must pay you for any repairs done (receipts- time you spend
tinkering does not count).   Find at at your DMV or DOL what the rules are in
your state.   be persistant and polite- this is not usual, but the people in
the bureaucracy can eventually find you the info your need.
