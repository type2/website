-Subject: RE: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ ??


The Bentley states that bearing damage will occur if the nut is torqued to anything over 250FtLbs.I do not remember if this applies to one specific reduction box type or both.

The torque wrench is your friend along with a paint pen to mark your progress so you don't miss anything.I know it sounds bad but this way you will not have parts falling off or self destructing because of being too tight or loose.I still get laughed at by my friends that work in service because I use a torque wrench on most everything,remember that if you have a vehicle serviced by anyone but yourself.

I went to the local VW guru. Had brakes redone. Back brake piston came out
of wheel cylinder 3 days later when wife romped on brakes. I could see the
cylinder but couldn't get the _at_)#$(_at_# nut off! Called said guru who laughed
and said that I didn't have enough a## to take the nut off because he really
torques them down.

I drove (sans brakes) to nearest shop with impact wrench. It could not get
it off! Said go find 1/2&quot; impact because his only was rated for 650 ft-lb!

Took it back to guru to replace brakes which he did. He was convinced it was
not adjustment, but something else. He spent time checking lines from MC
back to hub. Nothing.

I have the bus back now. Whew!

I am concerned that I can't get the hubs off with standard equipment (I
tried jumping on a breaker bar!)

What do you think of the Torqing? Why is it needed?

Thanks in advance,
