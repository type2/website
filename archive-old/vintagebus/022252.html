Hi Bill and Chris,

Thank you for your comments both good and bad about VOA. VOA is only a
small part of the fifth largest auto manufacture in the world. The us of
Volkswagen's logos and trade marks is some thing that is being dictated by
Volkswagen AG. Going from almost no regulations to having some rules for
the use of their trade marks is a jump of 100% and that makes people
nerves.  Because of this I have ask VOA Public Relations if they would like
to talk to the groupe at our up coming May 20th show. I have not gotten an
answer.

The Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club lives in VOA's back yard that has its
good and bad points that are unique to our location. I do like to hear from
other parts of the country with their concerns.

David Cook MVVC Show Chairperson
