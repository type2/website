I don't know if it's lead between the seams, but my DC bed is made the
same way. So is the bed of the rusted out mess that used to be a DC that
sits in the woods by my driveway. It looks like that's how they were
made.

&gt; Looking at the bed of my truck, I was struck by fact that there is a
&gt; bead of what looks like gray lead in the form of a cross.  It runs down
&gt; the center line of the bed and then a second bead crosses perpendicular
&gt; to that from side to side.  It looks to me like this is a seam.  Is this
&gt; right?  Is the bed made up of sections that they joined together at the
&gt; factory?.  These seems run between the ribs.  I've never looked that
&gt; close at a truck before.  Thanks.
