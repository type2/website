Subject: Re: [VB] Bus is finally home

Well, it's not really a huge project. I've seen a lot worse. This is a driving Bus, don't understand
me wrong.... only problem is it has usual Bus problems. For starters it spent most likely all its
life in Arizona and so heating has been tempered with. This Bus has no heat tube inside (cut off)
and otherwise seems to have weird set-up in the engine bay. I suspect that heat exchangers have been
tossed out. It will require work but in the meantime.... I'm driving it.
