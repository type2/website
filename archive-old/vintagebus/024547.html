Subject: International Shipping

Has anyone out there shipped a bus from europe?  I remember Mr. Van
Bondo did ship his camper over and posted his (horror?)story .  Anyone
willing to share some pointers and recomended names.  

Jim, could you p-mail me you're e-mail address so I could ask you some
specifics?  Thanks!

Thanks to all
