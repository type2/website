Subject: RE: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

You have to be from Phoenix to truly understand what Jim says is the 
absolute truth –

The day Ellis stops writing to this group, is the day I sell my splitty………….

&gt;Ellis sez:
&gt;It was all understood and written in an attempt of
&gt;what some folks call ~tongue in cheek~ humor. &lt;as in
&gt;Joke/attempted sly humor&gt;. It only appears that I'm
&gt;racist, anti-Semite and non-observant of over used
&gt;cliche' graphics affixed to and used to cheapen the
&gt;appearance of over priced vehicles. I am not
&gt;anti-Semitic by any means.
&gt;Living in Arizona I am keenly aware of what &quot;La Migra&quot;
&gt;is. They are the folks who blocked my residential
&gt;street for two hours with two 40 foot tourist-like
&gt;buses with a police car in front and in back of the
&gt;buses. The street was blocked while 120 &quot;immigrant&quot;
&gt;law breakers used up my tax dollars while being
&gt;removed from one small residential home and prevented
&gt;me from driving my VW bus to my destination. I thank
&gt;them for dragging down my property value. This
&gt;incident has been repeated 360,000 times in Arizona so
&gt;far this year alone.
&gt;BTW: I did wave at them as I was finally able to drive
&gt;by. I got curious and similar waves back at me.
