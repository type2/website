Subject: got another one...pics up

I finally went and picked up an old bus that I've known about for a 
while. The story was back in 1970 some hippies were driving through 
texas. They broke down and left their old bus. The old man pushed it 
into his yard and started using it as a shed. It sat there unmoved 
ever since.

Me and my brother headed there to pick it up today. Turns out it's a 
1959 Panel bus that has some camper windows in it. I have know idea 
if it's an american camper company or a home brew thing. There is no 
camper interior, just some home-made looking stuff. But it's not much 
and it's totally covered with tons of junk. The bus is totally rusted 
out in the rockers and one of the doglegs. The rockers were OLD rust, 
that was repaired with chicken wire and bondo back in the 60's. There 
and the engine is there, so I got to work on loading it up. All four 
tires were the old ones with tubes and were the flatest tires I think 
I've ever seen. The dirt of the ground was up to the rim of the 
wheels. I ended up changing 3 of the tires with some I brought. The 
last one actually held air.

We tried to pull it with a tow rope out of the yard, but the back 
wheels were locked up. I climbed underneath and saw that the shift 
couple was split in 1/2. So I wedged a tool in there and popped the 
tranny into something. It worked. We pulled it to the road and then 
wenched it up onto the trailer.

After getting it home, I dug through it a bit and took some quick 
pictures. There's a 40hp engine. Don't know if it's original or not. 
It's number is 5228076.

ID plate from behind the bench seat:

22 04 9
360 175
UW 211 GREY 461833

It's a shame it's rotted so much at the rockers and down low. It's 
pretty cool otherwise. I'm not sure I've got it in me to repair this 
one. It may get parted out.

Here's the pictures:

Let me know what you think.
