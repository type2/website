With a shot front end and all kinds of crap laying all over inside of the
bus (tools, interior panels, parcel tray, etc. - I managed to fire up the
bus (with its new plates and tags) and drove myself to the barber shop.
That first real trip in my splittie was awesome!  The wind blowing in the
window wings and the sound of the engine was all so surreal.  No wonder you
guys and gals love your old buses - I can see myself driving one of these
things until the day I die.  Anyway, once that was done, I filled the tank
and the gas guage only reads a hair above empty.  Wonderful - one more thing
to fix when I yank out the 1600 and put the 1776 in.  I think I just need to
get a new sending unit because the guage is brand spankin' new.  You should
have seen the people turning and staring as I drove around - it was like I
was in a parade. Moving right along, I drove to the lumber yard, loaded up 4
of my workmates and we cruised the lumber yard.  They all thought it was
awesome as well.  Even the gal that dumped me without ever telling me was
invited in for a quick ride around the yard and she accepted and rode and
enjoyed.

So this is what a VW high is like.

I like it.
