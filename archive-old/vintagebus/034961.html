I like that paint job. Much better that what I have seen on a bunch of show 
cars, actually.  What do you have against flowers, huh?  How do they hurt 
you?  Pretty flowers  :)

 When you say save it, you do mean save it from being a hippie bus don't you? 
 The poor guy looks like it has had to have gone around its whole life with 
 that disgusting paint job on it. I actually remember reading about that bus 
 in a old NEATO newsletter. That busses name should be sherman, and they ran 
 the TN chapter of the best bus club in the whole world.
