I really hesitated to write this because I just KNOW I'll sound like a
poophead, but -- wait, I'll just ask it in question form:  Am I wrong (yes,
I'm constantly wrong about things) to think that it seems like the notion that
sparkplugs need improved contact with the aluminum head is like killing a flea
with an ax?  I figure that the (stock) coil puts out about 15,000 volts which
is sufficient to LEAP from one piece of metal to the other, hence the
operation of the node end of a SPARK plug.  So I figure that there is nothing
to gain to try to improve the connection at the threads.  (There should be at
least *one* area of the threads that has contact with the aluminum - but even
that shouldn't matter, I wouldn't think.  If there was the condition that
there is &quot;no good contact at *any* of the threads&quot;, a spark could leap the 1
micron {or so} distance.)  I know the only way that a spark could not leap
this small distance is if there is a dielectric there in the gap.  Is aluminum
oxide, which is a bad conductor, sufficient to stop or even slow a high
voltage like this?  How would antiseize compound improve this situation if it
is just on top of the corrosion?  (Mind you I always use antiseize compound on
spark plugs for reasons other than conductivity.)

I can't remember who wrote about this - my intention is to just have a
clarification on this.  It seems to come up often.  Any input on what I might
be missing would surely be helpful.  Thanks in advance!  Flames welcome.
