yes, Steve H and Stephen G. showed up Thurs pm to relieve me of the 66 pop 
top westy that has been sitting in the back yard for slightly over 4 years.   
Complete with 76-77 Evergreen state college parking sticker, this is a long 
time oly hippy bus purple and green.  ANyway, sad to see it go through as I 
said, It didn't look like I was going to do anything with it.  

BTW, did you guys notice it has a side step complete rusted shut under the 
cargo doors?  Not the VW ambulance kind though.

so is the pop top still there?  or lost to the winds?   :)

Clara
