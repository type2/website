Hey All,

Awhile back, another Listee had made copies of the Type 2 (thru 67) parts
manual and was gracious enough to offer them to the rest of the list.

I currently have two copies that I do not need.   One is just the way it
came from him (unbound), and the other has been bound into two separate
volumes with page dividers.

I am trying to get most of my money back out of them (I paid $40 for each),
so I am offering them up to the list!

$35 for the unbound
$40 for the bound

prices are including bookrate shipping!

Please p-mail me if you are interested or have questions.

Just to let you know these are the same pages that can be found online at
the &quot;Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project&quot;
http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm

THANKS!
