Woah! You need to have 1/2 - 3/4&quot; *free* play before the lever moves, or
you'll wear out your cable in no time. Cable must be loose for 1/2&quot; before
pulling lever. There's a mushy additional inch or so before the TO bearing
contacts the pressure plate. Cable must not be under constant tension.
'halfinch free play' at the pedal means free play, not lightly tensioned
as compared with the tension when the TO bearing hits the pressure
plate.

Took me almost 20 years before someone showed me that. I'd been snapping
clutch cables every 10-12,000 miles til then. Since then, for the last 12
years, I've only replaced the cable once, last year.
