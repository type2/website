Having just recently used the new catalysed paints for the first time, the
thing that I see missing in your list is a respirator.  I've shot about 20
cars over the years, and a couple of months ago I shot the cyno-acrylate paint
for the first time.  FACT!!!  Respirator or die!  That stuff is NASTY! 
Synthetic enamel it ain't.  It won't get you high, it'll get you dead.  You
NEED to get the proper filters too.  If you have a beard, you gotta shave. 
You really don't want to breathe the stuff.

Have fun.
