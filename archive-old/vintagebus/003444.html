That's funny....yes, I have many pics and some of them are up on my site(s).
www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Progress1.htm

The only reason some of the screws are painted is that I did not take off
the doors when I painted....the only screw/bolt I really &quot;detailed&quot; is the
one on the engine compartment door that holds the end of the door
holder-upper spring.  That bolt has &quot;VW&quot; inscribed in the end, so I polished
it.  That was a great waste of time. But worth it!

I just came up to eat lunch after installing the driver's side upper frame
assembly, and wouldn't you believe it:  Now that door is low, too!  Grr.

It barely closes, unless I lift hard and slam.  At least this one looks
right when it is closed....the other one doesn't seal at the top/rear.

On both of them, however, the space from front to back at the bottom is
uniform!  I don't get it....maybe it would be better for me to do the
adjustments once the bus is back on its wheels, as there may be some frame
movement that is contributing to the problem.

I'm really feeling the pressure now....jalousie windows need to be
done...engine needs to be in, and still lots to do before Red Barn/Kelley
Park!!!

&gt; OH wow!  You have any pics of your restoration.  You mentioned painted
&gt; screws, and it got me interested!  ;)
&gt; Anyway, just put some touchup paint on the screws after you're all said
and
&gt; done with it.  Leave all the touching up till the end though, because
&gt; chances are you'll need to take the doors off again for one thing or
&gt; another!
