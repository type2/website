&lt;&lt; Hi Steve, well the incorrect stuff was probably done
 in the past 40 years before current guy owned it..
  
 example;
 -tent barckets on the roof were painted from factory
 his are polished up
  &gt;&gt;
I have seen westys w/unpainted tent brackets on roof.  the ones on my 65 
weren't painted from factory, but installed bare metal after the bus was 
painted.
