I put a bay bumper and brackets on my '67, and it fit &quot;ok&quot; after I did a little
engineering on the brackets

&gt; Would an early Bay have the same rear bumper as my 63? When I was looking at 
&gt; it, it seemed to be the same but the two are 50miles away so I couldn't do a 
&gt; side by side comparo. Also would the shifter from the 69 work in the 63? This 
&gt; guy is parting out a very clean 69 (hit hard in front) and I'm trying to pick 
&gt; off as much as I can use.
