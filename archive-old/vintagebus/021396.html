Excuse my terminology but my mechanics learning days were in England, on my 
1934 Austin 7. SO I sometimes call things incorrectly, but I generally get my 
meaning across.

Well, you could try using what I call an Easy-out. You drill a small hole, 
then use this left hand threaded tapered gismo to get out the broken stud or 
whatever.
Of course if you do it wrong the easy-out breaks off inside the stud and you 
are really up ****-creek.
The trick is to use the right size easy-out for the broken stud. Too small 
will break, and too large will not have enough wall depth in the part to be 
removed and things jam.
Have fun.
