Y2K? We aint skeered! Following shows that no matter
how prepared you think you are there is always
something that slips your mind... (Half truth-half
pure lies)
We stored water, 5-55's with  the correct clorox
formula, amped out on MRE's, got the overpriced
generator, water beds stacked on top off one another,
canned the wheat and unpopped popcorn, did time at the
LDS cannery for charitable pre-paid Kharma, got the
hand grinder, opted for the LP refrigerator, selected
a woodburning stove, nabbed the handcrank baygen and
non-flashlights, made C.C.Crane, J.Stevens Company and
Art Bell rich, sold off all possessions, bought land
from Bo Gritz, got the shotgun with the pistol grip
and barrel cooler, a 45 for knock down power, 9mm with
the extra clips for the fire fight plus an
unregistered &quot;throw-down&quot; just in case the situation
got ugly, properly reported all sightings of large
black triangular objects the size of Kentucky,
Chem-trails and unsual last minute military activity,
bought gold, hoarded small bills, paid all January
bills early, got records of everything since Adam was
a pup, installed the security screendoors front and
back, painted the house in camo colors, loaded up on
propane and gasoline. Abstained from the party albeit
the one half of a Millenium Budweiser and... Whew!
What?! Nothing happened? &lt;yet?&gt; Great!

Paula wakes me up and tells me that she is going into
labor. Wha-da-f? Naw, Just the Braxton-Hicks that
&quot;they&quot; all told us to expect. I tell her just to chill
and watch the bowl games... Not to be it seems.
She is now comfy and resting in St. Joe's observation
for 48hrs with meds to stop the contractions. Hoping
to beg off for a few more weeks for that last minute
lung development thang. My sixth sense is that we
might be three by week's end. =) Will keep y'all
posted as things develop.

Now I gotta sell all of my Y2k stuff to buy some
Pedialite and diapers. ;-)
