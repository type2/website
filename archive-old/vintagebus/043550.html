Subject: [VB] Mail Order inquiry. my new bus rant
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10101111133560.17796-100000_at_prophet.eastvan.bc_dot_ca&gt;

It has been about 2 weeks since I've had my 59 panel and it is time to
prepare for some part ordering. I've seen numerous places online, heard
various things about quality and I need help simplifying the jungle.
Is there a one stop or short list of recommended mail order places, brands
to avoid etc?


In short. I'm ready to blast the bottom of the vehicle, beadblast the
interior and put in new metal as required. Prime immediately thereafter 
Now that I'm at this point it is obvious that this vehicle needs ALL new
body seals when this is done. Windows, cargodoor, doors, engine lid, the
works.

I want to get a complete set w/o paying a huge pile of cash and be able
to return with subsequent orders of niggly interior bits, possibly some
replacement panels and IMMEDIATE  part requirements like wiperbits and
clutch components and tranny/drive train misc. 

[need to elimenate the in neutral growly and incomplete wipers for
insurance purposes. I'm pulling the 1600 out next week to find out what
sort of clutch kit I need and installing the new/rebuilt shiny in the bag
tranny with redux boxes at the same time] 

I'm attempting to complete each stage completely, properly and install
good quality nice fitting bits as I go. I love picking through part yards
bit the pickins are slim around here so I figured I'd just work as much
overtime as possible to fund the project, listen to all your opinions and
have it complete minus interior setup considerations by summer.

Pardon my newbiesque post. Pls reply private if necessary and for what it
is worth I'm keeping track of all relevant info obtained to post on my
project website. Stay tuned to vintagebus_dot_com for new stand by your van
shot.

probably too excited to type effectively for some time...

bags full of fiberglas insulation and 70's basement woodgrain interior
panels, misc burned spoons and the sort. approx 3&quot; Virgin Mary still
remains glued to the centre of the Dash. :)
