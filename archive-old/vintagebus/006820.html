Thom, I must agree on the safe bus issue, but Jerome isn't a weekend of
drunkedness and unsafe buses,I go and I don't even drink!, my buses are
safe, it's a get together, a rekindling of old friendships, a get together
to swap all the bus stories that are to long to post and the stories of
those who don't care or know what the LIST is, a get together of all types
and forms of buses and people, splits, loafs, breadboxes and euro's, poor,
rich, tall, short, fat, skinny, pretty or ugly, where enimies become friends
again, where wrongs are made right, a true get together of the devoted
following of the VW Bus, in my opinion it is a must do, Heck I blew off
going to VANFEST in England to attend Jerome, was allready to go when I
checked the calender and made the decision to do Jerome instead.
