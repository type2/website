Hello Group

    I have a late bus seat I think it is out of a 68 thru ? It fits fine in
my 67 deluxe bus and it has a handle on the side for the seat to fold
forward. It is a full bench and I have the clamps on both outer sides of the
seat. The only thing I don't think works is the 2 inner rails. They are not
bolted down but the seat is firmly bolted with the other 4 clamps.

&gt; Greetings list:
&gt;
&gt;  Let us look at the 1966 bus middle seat and the 1967 middle seat one
&gt; more time.  The  distance between the outer seat rails on the seats have
&gt; been measured and my findings conclude that yet another piece of
&gt; equipment was solely produced for the 1967 bus.  The distance for the
&gt; 1966 seat is approx. 43 inches and the distance for the 1967 middle seat
&gt; is approximately 38 inches.  The arm rest for the two seats are also
&gt; different.  The 66's arm rest connects to the backrest of the seat and
&gt; to the top of the seat rail.  The 67's seat rest connects only to the
&gt; back of the seat rest.  A couple people have pmailed me with advise and
&gt; I would like to thank them for their help.
