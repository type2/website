Don't feel bad. I went through this stuff for a year and a half on my 60 Double cab. Some people think this number stuff is so easy, I have a heck of a time keeping track. The previous owner of mine told me that it was a 59. I have since deciphered it is a 1960. I have grown to be OK with that. At the risk of being proven wrong again here is my chassis # 547 523. More than one person told me that if it is a true 59 the shifter will be back next to the seat. Good luck coming to terms with all of your new insight.
