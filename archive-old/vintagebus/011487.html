Subject: for sale; a rant
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

this is a rant that has me upset, many items are listed on the list for sale, i take this as an offering to listys to have first shot at an item that they need to finish,start
or help in keeping there type 2 on the road, the list is for vintage type 2 owners, i feel that if you are going to put some item up for sale on the list you did it for the sake of a listy that needs it, so let them have the first shot at it! i have responded to many items for sale on the list but yet have to purchase any, i've been the first person,said i would take it and tried to make arrangments for pick-up and/or shipping but when it comes down to it i get the response (after waiting) that i sold it to my neighbor
put it on the street and sold it, a guy came by and bought
it,etc. so if you are putting something on the list for sale and a listy says they want it make the arrangements and sell it to them, give them a chance to make the arrangements, this list goes all over the world so we are not all next store
so if you don't plan on selling it to a listy, don't tease us with it. sorry for the bandwidth.
