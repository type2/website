Hey Rex,
The FI cases are  made out of the AS21 alloy which is
supposed to be better in that it is more heat resistant.  It was used to
match the hotter, leaner FI engines.  If you look on the side of the sump,
it should say AS21.  I think it has more Aluminum content in it than the
old AS41 cases.  The new AS41 cases are supposed to be as good as the old
AS21 cases, but I have my doubts.
