Go to the classic in June and bring all the stuff back on the plane.


I've finally found the correct interior for my 64' sundial camper.  Problem
is...  I'm on the east coast, its on the west coast.  As these things go, I
can arrange for local delivery to a friend in san diego, but still need to
get it shipped out here.  Has anyone had experience with this
