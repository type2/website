For what its worth I am planning on attending.  Unfortunately, my bus is 
still a quite a ways from running and my Son's panel won't be roadable til 
summer sometime so I can't give any kind of landmark to say &quot;here I am&quot;.  I 
can say that I will be wandering about with the kid with blond hair to the 
middle of his back wearing the loose brimmed camo hat smoking home rolled 
cigs.

We are rolling down from Benicia in the North Bay (CA) and may be taking the 
F**D van or the H**da... depending on if there is any hope of finding a 
straight rear bumper w/ overriders or middle seat frame within budget/reason 
for my '62 or a well priced Eberspacher for my son's '63 Panel.  If we take 
the &quot;BEAST&quot; I can offer some space.
