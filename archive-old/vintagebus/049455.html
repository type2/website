Subject: That Nick Drake song on VW commercial

I'm jumping in kinda late, but  at least &gt;I&lt; waited til Friday  ;)

VW gets no points for me for using this song - for starters, I DESPISE
people who ransack dead artists' reputations for their own profit.

But mainly coz  the song is about &gt; D E A T H  &lt;   and it makes me very
amused that VW has these kids tooling around to a song about shuffling off
the mortal coil. Makes me wanna buy the car, but only if it comes w/ bodies
in the trunk.
Note to the ad agency: LISTEN to the song before you make it a commercial.
Don't get me started about WHAT Levi's wuz thinking when they wanted to use
&quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; for a commercial.............

And PLEASE don't make this a thread; pmail if you must, but I just had to
rant after so many 'neats' and 'cools' got tossed around.
