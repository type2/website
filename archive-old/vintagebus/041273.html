&gt; OK, So now what kind of adjustments do you make for 35+ year old equipment?
&gt; I'm assuming that the resistance will increase with age just like in the wiring
&gt; harness. Is it possible I have enough resistance built up in my sender and
&gt; gauge to make it seem to work correctly?  A happy coincidence for me?
&gt; Interesting...

Hmmm.... you shouldn't see too much change in the resistance of the wire.
Usually the extra resistance is from oxidized connections. I would check
the following:

1) Are connection to guage or sender badly oxidized?
2) Are you sure it's a 6v guage?
3) Check the voltage on both sides of the guage, is it 12v at one side? 

I mention 3, because from looking at the wiring diagrams it looks like you
could stick the 12v-&gt;6v circuit somehwere other than right before the
guage itself.... so you might have one, and not know it.
