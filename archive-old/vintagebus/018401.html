Subject: 67 Door handle problems...
To: vintagebus-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hello all,
  Thank you very much for your excellent hi/low relay
information.  It was that, that allowed me to finally
have a fully working turn signal with Brights!
  New question, I have my original 67 door handles and
just about any kind of key will open them.(other cars,
my house keys, etc.)  Is this something that I can fix
myself without knowledge of locksmithing or can a
locksmith fix this?  Do I need new handles?  Another
puzzle.  Does anyone find that after market vent wing
rubber does'nt fit perfectly to make a nice seal?  Or
is it my vent wing itself that's not allowing it to
fully close and seal itself against water.  My frames
are not rusted out.  Any experiences with these woes? 
 Thanks again,  J.D.
