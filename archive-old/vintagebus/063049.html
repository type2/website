Subject: '50-'62 Bentley Manual  IN STOCK - $75!

I just received my first, &quot;pre-release&quot; shipment of the long awaited Bentley
Service Manual covering the '50-62 Bus, hot off the presses.

My introductory price is $74.95.

My everyday discount price will be $79.95, starting in about a week, if
there are even any left by then.  (I discount all books and manuals by
roughly 20-30% everyday.)  Part number is BENTLEY V262.   Of course, I also
have the BENTLEY V267, which covers '63-67, for $66.95.

You can order toll-free, or simply by clicking on this link:
http://busdepot_dot_com/ASP/SearchProdId.cfm?ProdId=V262&amp;B1=Search

Get 'em while they're hot!  (And in stock!)
