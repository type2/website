&gt; Has anybody ever bought window seals from ISP West?  If so, are they
quality
&gt; seals?  There is an auction on ebay for a set of them, and it ends in an
&gt; hour.  I really need window seals, so I'm thinking of getting those.  Any
&gt; comments?  Thanks.

It's probably someone else's rubber their selling, but if they have it on
auction 100% of the time you can call and buy it direct, usually cheaper.
