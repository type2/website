Hi Ronnie,
Great to hear about the procurement of the NOS front floor to repro and that 
you are going to do a correct engine seal!  We have been wondering about your 
efforts reproing the windshield rubber with corners as the original VW ones 
were.  The repro ones now availible without the molded in corners work well 
and probably would be hard to beat cost wise.  What would be a great seal to 
repro with the original corners would be the safari windshield outer frame to 
body rubber or coming up with a better designed seal for these than even the 
original VW ones.  Thanks,  Eric&amp;Barb
