Subject: Re: [VB] clutch/flywheel question

While the 1600 is being rebuilt, use the clutch and flywheel off of it.
Then just swap them back to the 1600 after the rebuild.

&gt; I have a 1200 out of an early bus. A buddy of mine wants to put it in
later bus. A 71 camper. He is getting his 1600 rebuilt. What clutch/fly
wheel combo does he need. The flywheel on the 1200 is a 6volt I`m pretty
sure. The problem I See is that the 71 tranny has the collar for the t/o
bearing.  Any suggestions?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave
