That's been my experience also in the past. It is always good to talk to
one of the mechanics that has experience with aircooled. They can
usually go back to the counter person and tell them where to find the
information.

The last ten or twelve years I have found that nearly all of my parts
needs are met by sources other than VW.

My experience is that some VW places are better about this than others.
VW does still stock some parts and I have gotten stuff from them. I
think the problem is that the parts guy has to pull out microfische and
look up parts the old fashioned way. They can't just look it up on the
computer like they can with new parts.

Ususally the younger the guy behind the counter the more likely you are
going to get blown off.
