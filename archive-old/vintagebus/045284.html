PIP still stocks the parts to service the Westfalia bus wood slat roof racks.
They sell the top rail tubing sections for $15 a piece.  I am going to buy a
whole set.  If anybody else out there needs to buy these parts (some have
hinted, so this is not entirely a shameless plug) then you can get in touch
with Parts Is Parts via
their webpage:
