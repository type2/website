I'm sorry to disagree, but I have experienced two kinds of brake fade.  I 
believe what you refer to happened to me with a 1971 Ch_at_vy, with my HEAVY 
trailer w/ a yellow split bus (bus content) and a motorcycle on it, and I was 
traveling the mountains of Colorado.  In this case I pushed on the pedal, and 
encountered resistance, but NO stopping power no matter how hard I pushed.  
(The fellow with me said, &quot;We're only going 45 mph, I'll just jump out.&quot;)

The other kind of fade is the type in which the brake pedal goes to the 
floor, and won't pump up.  Perhaps my theory of expanding brake drums is 
incorrect, but they're both scary as h_at_ll, so I think I'll use my engine to 
brake slightly on long downhill rides.
