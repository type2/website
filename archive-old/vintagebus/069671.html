Subject: best brakes, engine and transmission

H i I am frank an am new to the list I heard this is THE place so I hope 
to get in.
hi folks I am new to the list but not busses I have a 67 with a stock 
1500 single port complete with rev limiter. (used to have '65, '68, '69 
and '71 westy and many bugs and a dunebuggy)
I just bought the bus here in florida and it is in good shape all 
original recent rebuild.


I hope to build an engine with more power and I an looking for some 
advice on what you folks think is the best bus engine-I used to work at 
a vw shop so my mechanical skills should be adequate.
Then comes the transmission? I have reduction boxes but feel no need to 
remove them why not have a transmission built to suit modern traffic. I 
would like some oomph and ability to drive at the speed limit. What is 
the ideal rpm for hwy cruising.  I swear in my '68 bus with a stock 1600 
dp I got 30 mpg on the hwy at 55-60 mph-ithink it turned about 3200. any 
favorite vendors?I know a lot of people switch to (cv joints-IRS) but I 
have no desire to do this .stock is mostly fine

last and most important is brakes. I remember many a time pulling up on 
the steering wheel and down on the brake pedal-scary.  My '71 had disc 
brakes and they were great. So I would love to find a disc brake 
conversion kit. I recently saw a '63 with discs and he said they were 
great. Any one know who offer a kit.
I would like opinions on the vendors that you use for stuf in general-so 
let me know

I need some body parts no too many-any favorite vendors
Also our roof is dented all over (i think it rolled) so If I can find a 
roof with windows and or a rag top I could cut and switch- any body have 
advice on headliner replacement-mine is perfect but will get taken out 
if I do any roof body work

One last question body work is not my strong point but I can do it- new 
methods have developed so what system are people using for welding in 
panels like rocker or battery. Mig , tig or non sheilded. thanks and 
remember enjoyment frank
