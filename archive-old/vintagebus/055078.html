While I didn't get a whole lot of response and advice about where to =
score an AJ case of if I even should, the advice I did get was very =
good.

I decided to buy a new case and it is at the machine shop as we speak, =
read, whatever. With this new engine the only original mechanical stuff =
on the bus will be the beam, steering box and cooling tin. Everything =
else is new.

A little more than a week from now it will be my shop truck and third =
car.

Here's an interesting question: I have a '90 Mitsubishi Montero that is =
my shop truck now. I bought it new and it has 190,000 miles on the =
engine. The engine got a rebuild at 125,000 because it smoked a little. =
I was told that ALL Mitsubishi engines smoke at 125. Then I had to have =
the crankshaft replaced at about 175K when the bottom pulley split and =
damaged it. Recently I had to replace the ECM which ending up costing =
$1000 by the time it was over. I can't even change the starter in the =
Montero. Apparently one must remove all the intake manifold to get to =
the starter. I tried to do it, but it took me almost two hours to get =
out one bolt. The guys at my garage laughed that I had tried to do it =
myself. As much as I love it I am tired of having to shell out at least =
$400 and more like $1500 everytime this thing gets a problem.

So I have decided to build up the bus as my shop truck since I carry ALL =
my tools, an assortment of replacement parts and a floor jack whenever I =
drive it, and if it breaks I can, 95% of the time, get out and fix it =
and drive it away.

My wife and I talked about what car/truck I might buy to replace the =
Montero and, after serious thought, I realized I don't like any of them. =
There is no car/truck out there today that I want badly 'cuz you can't =
fix any of them.

I honestly feel that, if you remove the obvious safety aspect, there is =
no vehicle out there built today that is astruly useful and easy to =
repair as my '63 VW bus.

Am I wrong?
