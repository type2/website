&gt; Before replacing them in the beam should I do anything to them?

Hi Paul,
Best to just wipe them down just before installing and pumping the front beam 
full of grease. Also probably a good idea to tag the leaf springs as to which 
tube and direction they were put in.  Have heard of some failures that could 
have been possibly from reversing the wear direction on these springs.
