Subject: Bring Your Own Bus 6 - Less Than 2 Weeks to Go!

*April 08, 2006 - Bring Your Own Bus 6 *
* Aromas, California *
Richard Stewart and the Silicon Valley Chapter of Strictly Vintage 2s
presents the Sixth Annual Bring Your Own Bus show and swap at the Red Barn
along Hwy 101 in Aromas, CA (15 mi. north of Salinas, CA, 45 mi. south of
San Jose, CA).

All prices are charged by the Red Barn, we don't get a cut of it.

Friday Night Camping - $10
Swap Spot - $10
Bus Show Entry - Free**
**however, you need to park inside the show/swap area to do that, so the
barn will charge you $10

Huge Swap and Huge Raffle! Raffle tickets are 50 cents each or 15 for $5!

Directions:

From Hwy 101 Southbound, about 45 miles south of San Jose you'll pass
through a grove of eucalyptus trees and about .5 mile after that will see a
large red barn on the left side of the freeway (opposite a Beacon gas
station). Use the turn lane to cross oncoming traffic and enter the grounds.
Be VERY careful crossing traffic! We've yet to have an accident and want to
keep it that way.

From Hwy 101 Northbound, about 15 miles north of Salinas you'll come over a
large hill and will immediately see a large red barn on your right side.
Exit right into the grounds and you're set!

Friday Night: Gates anticipated to close at 10pm.

Saturday Morning: Gates reopen around 7am. Show is from 8am to 1pm!
