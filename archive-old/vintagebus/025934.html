To the friendly and knowleagable list members,

The Kombi has holes in both the front and back bumper overriders on the
passanger side and some mounts about four feet apart above the drip
rail. It also has some intersting holes drilled on the inside roof bows.

It had &quot;large spoon&quot; popouts all the way around when I bought it. Any
comments or Ideas about these holes would be apeciated.
