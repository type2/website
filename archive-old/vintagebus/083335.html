Subject: Re: [VB] switched to dual carbs = lower mpg

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I've heard of people getting bettter and poorer milage when switching to
&gt; dual carbs... as was said.. jetting does make a difference.
&gt;

Just to add to this, I opened up the airflow meter on my 79 westy and
adjusted it to give me 12.5:1 at WOT and gained an additional 5mpg over
stock. Still runs cool, but just sips fuel. It's always safer to jet on the
rich side, but if you take your time to get it spot-on, it's definitly worth
it. I'm saving about $5 to $6 per fill-up which add's up quick!

Correct jetting can make such a huge difference. Assuming it's right &quot;out of
the box&quot; can be money down the drain. Hook a wideband up to it (forget plug
reading) and set it for 12.5:1 at WOT and you'll get smokin gas mileage and
still run cool. I'm running the cheap 85 octane too!  :-P
