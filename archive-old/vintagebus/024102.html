Subject: jerome

jerome what is jerome, well if you live in the western U.S.of A. jerome
is the one bus meet that should not be missed, started 8 years ago by a
dedicated bus freak it has grown
to one of the largest VW bus events in the country,even though the vw
mags (hot vw
and vw trends) don't feel it is an event worth covering in person, (you
know, no water pumpers, and ti##y contest) but it's probably good they
don't it's grown by word of mouth over 400 vehicles, and where else
could you win a restored bus, this year it's a
sundial walkthrough camper, second grand prize is a rebuilt longblock,
and i just
heard a set of 4 tires along with a truckload more of prizes, new
venders will be there this year 8 pre registered already, and about
every one there has swap stuff for sale
not counting the buses for sale etc. so if your looking to buy,sale,
trade a bus or parts this is the place to be, beats the heck out of the
pomona (swap) thieves


ronnie ( 5000 pounds of swap stuff in my 62 panel) will try to keep up
with vwhoward
1 day and the road trip begins, wish us luck see you'all there
