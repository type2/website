30 miles a day?  Ha...I do 3-4 times that a day.  Think finding a gas
station is tough sometimes?  How about finding a one in a million
charging station?  I'm all for electric, but we need more of um.

&gt; I don't have any other details except to say that EV's are great! My
&gt; electric Thing is saving me money while the price of gas goes up past
&gt; $1.70/gal. here in California. Fill the batteries every month with a
&gt; buck's worth of distilled water and $1.50 worth of Reddy Kilowatt and
&gt; I'm good for 30 miles a day.
