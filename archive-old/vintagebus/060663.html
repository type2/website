Subject: removing axles from splitcase tranny?

Hi All,

Got a good splitcase tranny for my barney and I've
just apent a coupla hours pulling the reduction boxes
('later'  57 splitcase with small nut reduction boxes) off it.

There's no circlips holding the axles in?  There seems to be
a collar instead?

Can someone give me a tip on how to get the axles out?
(I'd guess this collar has to be extracted - but how?  Not
much room in there for a tool......)

Thanks

RobK
