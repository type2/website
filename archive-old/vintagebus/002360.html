Hey Bob,
I have a hitch on my 67 deluxe that I use to
tow my bugs to and from the paint shop.
Made by Eckhart. 1 800 u can tow or www.eckhart_dot_com
It's a very clean design. Can get photos in you want.
Not sure if it was a custom one off or not but it's
very easy to remove although it does use a bolt through the bumper.
