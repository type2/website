Subject: Re: [VB] vehicle dollies - NOW GET THIS

OK, dollies are great, but there's a guy calling himself Karmann Jack up
here in these parts, and he has invented something I would expect to see on
the Red Green show (well, maybe if it had more duct tape).  It's a
ROTISSERIE for cars!!

There is a stand at each end of the Beetle or KG body, and a bracket which
bolts to the bumper mounts.  The bracket mounts to the stand on a crude
bearing, and the bracket is offset so that things are balanced, and you can
rotate the whole body on a lengthwise axis.  There is a t-handle set screw,
like on bench-mount engine stand, to hold the car in position.  This way
you can sandblast the bottom of you car while standing up, with plenty of
light.  The guy actually brought a whole stripped KG body, less floorpan,
to the West Side VW meet in Minneapolis a couple of years back, and set the
whole thing up.  I think he was taking orders for the contraption.  No word
on weather customers had to sign a libility release...


Seems like you could easily make a HEAVY DUTY version for buses...

P.S. Don't forget to drain all fluids and empty the ashtrays before
rotating your car...
