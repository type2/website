Steven Reed from Belleville, KS (my 66's home town!) has kindly offered me a
baywindow tank from a 70 bus.  I have some questions that need to be
answered to help me decide whether or not to go this route.

#1abc)  Will the 12v sender from this tank work with my 6v bus guage?  Will
I need a new guage?  Can a 12v to 6v resistor drop be used in anyway to help
with this conflict?

#2)  Will a 6v sending unit from a split window bus tank fit in a baywindow
tank with no mods?

#3)  Will the stock gas cap from a splitty tank go onto a baywindow tank?

Thanks for the answers volks...
