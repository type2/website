I have an opportunity to get a tranny and motor that has been in a '74
Bus.  I am wondering if there are any listees that have some valuable
input to share re: this swap.
I am leaning toward lowering the Bus overall.  But haven't completely
given up on the idea of swapping the tranny out to adapt to the swing
axle/reduction box set up.
Costs it seems are about equal wither way, from what info I have already
gathered.
The end process I decide to go with will involve the individual components
being rebuilt as part of the costs involved.
I may piss off some purists with this post, but I'm to set in my ways,
having done mostly custom restorations and few stock resto's.
Sorry!  But to each their own
later
