  After running out of gas (again) on the freeway Tuesday eve, I decided it
was time to upgrade to the baywindow gas tank and try to fix my
malfunctioning gas gauge. I e-mailed listee Karl von Salzen to see if he had
a tank, and sure enough it was delivered by UPS on Friday. That's what I
call service, and it was a beautiful tank with all of the little doo-dads
you need to install it. Decided to do the install this morning so I would
have it ready for the drive to the OCTO/Classic next weekend.
   Obtained 2x5 gal gas cans from my friend Chris, the tank was full, of
course. Pumped the tank out into the cans using the Facet electric fuel
pump. Did you know that gas will not flow through an electric fuel pump when
it's turned off? Good thing to know in case of the unthinkable. Anyway, will
the tank was being drained, I removed the rear seat, pedestal, and all the
tools and survival stuff that lives under the seat. I then removed the
bulkhead covers that give access to the tank. Removed the straps and sending
unit wires. By then the tank was empty. Disengaged the big rubber grommet
around the filler neck, then  pried up the tank to release it from 35 year
old double sided tape which held it to cotton webbing and the floor.
Everything was in remarkable condition. The rubber gasket around the tank
outlet, while somewhat compressed, was still soft and supple, quite useable.
The cotton webbing that protected the tank from the straps and the floor was
in excellent condition, the tape was still sticky. God Bless VW.  Extracted
the tank without difficulty, then hacksawed off the filler neck about 2 in.
longer (per Thom's procedure) than the baywindow neck Karl sent me. Adapted
the pieces of tank retaining strap that came with the tank by bending them
90 degrees, then doubling back for extra strength and drill 11/32 thru for
the 8mm stud that sticks up from the floor.  Installed the straps, tightened
everything down, installed the filler neck with the HUGE piece of fuel line
and connected it to the tank. Tightened all the clamps quite securely,
connected the sending unit wires, replaced the bulkhead covers, the crawled
underneath (for the first time!) and connected the hose to the tank outlet
with a clamp. Poured the gas into the new tank  and reinstalled the seat,
tools and debris. Total elapsed time about 3 hours. Now to order a 12v gas
gauge and it will all be taken care of.

I love it when a plan comes together.
