Steve Dolan from DC is in New Mexico and having some engine problems.  The
MSHP 2.2 litre he is running in his Vanagon is running hotter than
acceptable.

This means that he may indeed need another engine.  He will be heading
along 40 west toward southern california.

If there is anyone out that way with a good running used 2.0 litre engine
that severl of us could buy, and get to steve or have him meet it somewhere
it would be great.  I will help pay for it and take care of the cost along
with some other listy's.  I have comitted 50 bucks to the cause.  HELP IF
YOU CAN!

This guy takes one vacation every two years and this is it.  He works hard
for this list so let's help him if we can folks.  We may or may not need it
but it would be good to know it is there if we do.

Come on list, you helped me so much and this is my chance to give back a
little.  Join me in this cause to help out our type 2 brother.

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
