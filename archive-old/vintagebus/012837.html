Listies:

I'm getting ready to put a top-end rebuilt back into FNB (Foo-neck-betty) and
remember a post lauding the ability of full-flow filters on engine
preservation.  St. Muir (post-mortum) points out that the high pressure pumps
of these may be unsuitable for the VW engine.  I've the following ?s:

Are there specific full-flow pump/oil filter units specific to a 1600 eng?

Is it easy to install?

What is the filter orientation relative to the engine comp/ground/etc. (FNB=65
21W ragtop delux)?

Is this a list-sanctioned modification?

Does Bus Depot carry these?

That's all volks
