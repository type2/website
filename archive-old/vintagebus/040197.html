Hey List,
    Killer time at BYOB and Kelly park eh, need some signs for the swap 
though! I was talking to Ronnie on sunday about gas heaters and he mentioned 
of someone in colorado who remanufactures and sells them. Does any one out 
there know of this and if so could provide me with a way to contact them? 
With winter coming up (yeh I know still a while off) and my bus as a daily 
driver I would love the extra comfort (got spoiled when I started driving my 
golf!). I would also be intrested in a good working unit if anyone could 
find it in their hearts to part with it! Also is it possible to surmount a 
12V wiper motor in a 63', love to hear stories of good idea, bad idea, 
thanks guys and gals I'll talk to you later.
