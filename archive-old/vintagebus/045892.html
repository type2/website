When I looked at this question a couple of years ago, I had the standard 
seats from my 83 Porsche 944 sitting in the garage. I had already put 
different seats in the 944. 
The Porsche seats were brown, not a bad color for our green 67 Westy.
I took the stock VW seats out, and placed the 944 seats on top of the stock 
VW seat brackets. 
Since I knew the Porsche seats were way more comfortable than the VW seats, 
and since I didn't expect to sell the bus ever, the question of &quot;non stock&quot; 
was a non issue. The comfort of my back side was.

I noted that the weld in seat brackets from VW had to go. They went. I made 
up a custom plywood support for the driver's side to give a flat platform for 
the Porsche seat rails to attatch to. The wheel well that the seat is on is 
higher on the door side than on the middle. I worked to keep the wood support 
to be as low as possible but level. I then bolted the Porsche seat rails 
through the wood and sheet metal of the wheel well, with a large backing 
washer in the wheel well for strength. I painted the wood to match the floor, 
and got new repro seat stand mats from Wolfsberg West. The driver's seat is 
now right behind the steering wheel, is a bit taller than stock ( I have a 
modification to the seat in mind to fix some of this), and for and aft 
adjustable. The seat itself has a rake adjuster for the seat back.
The passanger seat was easier. Since it doesn't need to center on the 
steering wheel, it goes as far to the side as it will fit. The seat rail 
bolts directly to the wheel well. A 2x4 is the exact correct height for the 
inboard rail. Through bolted to the wheel well with backing washers. Paint 
the wood, add a seat stand mat and ready to go.
At the same time, I upgraded the stock seat belts to should harness, inertia 
reel units. Took some cutting and welding on the door jam to mount the 
shoulder part, and custom units for the receivers in the walk through but 
very modern feeling and looks stock. Works well.
It's my bus, and I want it my way.
I am doing a full resto of the Wesphalia wood etc that will be custom but 
look stock.
