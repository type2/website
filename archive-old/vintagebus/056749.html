&lt;&lt;   My 63' bus has a 16DP with a 34 pict 3.  Right now,
 the only return spring for the thottle is the one on
 the carb. It isn't strong enough to fully return the
 pedal.  Should there be an additional return spring
 somewhere?  The original cable was pretty rough, so I
 already replaced it (fully greased ) but it made
 little difference.

The one spring should be fine- unless you have a extra heavy pedal- like if 
you have that bare foot thing on it.   I do, so I use a spring between the 
upper &amp; lower carb halves, and also between fan housing and carb- the old 
school one on the accelerator cable.  But maybe your spring is just wimpy and 
you need a stronger one.  It should spring back real snappy.

Did you grease up the linkage by the pedal?
