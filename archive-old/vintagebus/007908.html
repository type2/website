Tonight I had the guru blast my tranny carrier and nosecone clean in his
Snap On blasting cabinet.  This item is a $4200 piece of equipment and he
offered it to me for $1,000.  Man, if I only had $1,000 to spend.  You can
put ANYTHING into this cabinet and it comes out sparking clean - 110F
detergent solution cleans it all!  Anyhow, my nosecone bushings are shot and
I'm going to have to drill old ones and install new ones - where do I find
these bushings?

Also I'm weighing my options as for the reverse lights thing.  Wade gave me
a nice list of alternatives.  I could drill and tap my nosecone for the
reverse light switch (which I would love to do as I have tons of reverse
switches on all these junk trannies).  I could also just get a 67 nosecone
with the switch already installed (needle in haystack) or KOCH's has a gizmo
that fastens to the speedo cable and trips the lights once you start backing
up.  I like the last idea but once again - it's more money.  In the interest
of time, I may just go ahead and use this nosecone but add the KOCH's unit
later once the VISA gets paid off.

Anyone got the nose cone bushings?
