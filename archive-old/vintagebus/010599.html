Ya, the trim strip covers the edge of the linoleum, not where the lock bars 
go in.   it is a little inboard from there.   THink about it, if the strip 
was that far towards the doors, it would actually make it harder to close the 
doors, as it would be in the door frame area. 

but I have the impression that the bay strip was just the same as the late 
splitty stuff, just a tad shorter.  In fact I got some out of a junkyard, but 
found it was shorter compared to a splitty one, and it was the same stuff.  I 
guess that is narrower, if you are talking the width of the door way.

One question I have woindered about is how well did the original set up seal, 
against water creeping under the lino?  Even if the bus is sealed with good 
seals and all, getting in and out on rainy days, or just the rain falling 
when the doors are open, it'll want to creep under the lino and rust he floor 
out.

 I measured the trim strip on my 77 Westy....it is 45''
 long. I measured the door opening on my 66 Deluxe...
 it is 46''. Even though the bay strip is an inch
 short, 
 
 **wouldn't you have to cut it in the middle because of
 the lower cargo door latch pins?**

 NO! the trim strip sits back enough so that the doors
 can close. The edge of the pre-68 &lt;not pre-67 like
 alot of folks insist on stating!!!&gt; flooring sits back
 away from the inside edge of the cargo doors. This
 aluminum strip is one piece on the splitty buses. I
 saw this one piece strip on a '69 bay this AM. It's
 thinner and not the same.
