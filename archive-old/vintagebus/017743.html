Actually, that's true. And don't forget another VW
garage sale here in GA. I didn't post it to this list
because the only bus is a bay-window. Anyone
interested can check out my web site at
www.geocities_dot_com/ignatius.geo, and look at the For
Sale section.

&gt; &quot;What's in your Garage?&quot; would make a great friday
&gt; topic.
&gt; Also, with the VW Garage Sales going on in Utah and
&gt; Florida; how about
&gt; an &quot;International VW Garage Sale Day&quot; so everyone
&gt; can list the parts they
&gt; want to put on the market.
&gt; While I'm at it...isn't there some way for the
&gt; people at E-bay to separate
&gt; the toys from the rest of the VW listings?

&gt; For help leaving the list, send a HELP message to
