Subject: Cargo doors needed for 67 Westy
Date: Sun, 4 Jun 2000 22:20:46 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am in need of a set of good, rust free cargo doors for my 67 Westy. I
don't need the windows or any other hardware; just the doors. I could also
use a nice engine lid if anyone has an extra! Drop me a line if anyone has
some they would like to sell, please! Thanks,
