OML (Oh mighty list),

I am searching for the rubber boot that covers the electrical
terminal on the license plate light on my '63. Not the rectangular
seal around the lense, but the boot that covers the wire on the
back side.  Does anyone know if these are being reproduced, or
better yet does anyone have one good used or NOS.   Are they
the same for later years?  What part number am I looking for?

Also, I am looking for a metal license frame for the now defunct
dealership in La Canada, California &quot;Foothill VW&quot;  Anyone?
