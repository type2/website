&gt; My  much-maligned air cooled Vanagon Westy is a comfortable and
&gt; relatively affordable vehicle - cost about the same as an old worn
&gt; out Honda. Granted, it is not a sexy VW and I've had to put up with
&gt; rude comments from other VW owners, but it works for my needs.  That's
&gt; what I'm driving home tonight.

&gt; Hey Jim  I agree with him. except I will drive my waterboxxer home  tonight.
&gt; After years of driving splitties I have found that the  waterboxxer vanagon
&gt; westy is the best way to go,   Great seats, PS  steering , Ac , Great Heat,
&gt; sleeps 4 , bought it for $2400 2 years ago and my  wife loves the room and
&gt; comfort. It's funny but the older you get the wiser you  get  :)  later  mark

Mark, you beat me to the same response. Unfortunately, Vanagon westys prices
have gone thru the roof lately.  Scuttle butt on the vanagon list this week
has been about a guy paying $73K for a totally redone syncro westy to the
volks at Go Westy.

The vanagon volks think split window drivers drive them cuz they can't
afford a vanagon! 

Whodathunk?
