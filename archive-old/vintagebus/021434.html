&lt;&lt;  I need to rebuild 2 early bus transaxles.  I have torn 
two down already  and have a couple more to scavenge 
parts from.  The two I already tore  down both had 4.375 
ring &amp; pinions in them (1 Richmond splined and 1  
Klinkenburg keyed).&gt;&gt;

So you managed to find a splined 4.375 set?  I assume it 
also had a 8-bolt ring gear?  If so thats not too common
of a R/P.  I believe that that ratio came in late '67/68 Type 1
transaxles right before they switched over to the 4.125
ratio.  The 6 volt Type 1s were 4.375 but they were keyed
and came with a 6-bolt ring gear.  I have seen a few 4.375
ratio'd 8-bolt sets in post-'64 Busses but they were keyed.
As far as I know all redux box transaxles came from der
fadderland with keyed pinion sets as the splined version
didn't start showing up until the Type 1 went with IRS in '69.
By that time, of course, we're talking about a Bus of a 
different color. (and transaxle).  AFAIK- the post-'64 splits
came with a keyed 4.125 pinion but could be ordered with
a keyed 4.375 8-bolt R/P set.  Anyone out there with more
info??  
 
&lt;&lt; What I want to do is put a 4.125 in one tranny and a 
3.875 in the other.  They need to be 8 bolt ring gears and 
keyed pinions with nuts.&gt;&gt;

OK- not too much of a problem with the 4.125 as most post-'64
Busses came that way.  I know of NOS 4.125 sets as well if 
interested. The 3.875 set only came with the splined 4th as they 
were introduced in '73.  I assume you want the keyed pinion shaft
so you can run the Bus .82 4th gear?  If so, the early 002 IRS
transaxles came with that ratio for 4th as well and they will 
press onto the 3.875 pinion shaft w/o a problem.  You would need
to surface the large pinion shaft splines slightly to get it to accept
the coarse toothed 3rd set but that shouldn't present too great
a challenge.  Also, you would need to run the early pre-'73
mainshaft with those gears but this is all pretty straight forward
for a transaxle builder.  This particular set up is fairly popular
and I do a couple a month at this time.  
 
 &lt;&lt;For the 4.125, I think I need to be looking for a 1960-1963 
bus tranny,  but do they have 6 or 8 bolt ring gears?&gt;&gt;

Look for the large 46mm nutted post-'64s as thats were I have
seen the majority of the 8-bolt sets.  
 
&lt;&lt;For the 3.875, what were the stock applications?....&gt;&gt;  

That ratio was intro'd in '73 with the advent of the single side
cover style Type 1 IRS transaxles.  

I have these R/P sets as well as the 4ths you're looking for.
These are not rare and any VW transaxle builder should have
these laying about.  Good Luck!
