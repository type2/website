&gt; Is anyone making repro semaphore lenses?  If not, how many people
would be interested in some, and how much would you pay?  I need a
set, but if I'm going to have to go through the hassle and expense of
getting molds made, it'd be nice to maybe get some of the investment
back.  Finally, are there any differences between bug and bus
semaphores?
&gt;
I am 100% sure they are repro'd by somebody.  Koch's always has multiple,
multiple sets laying around.  I don't know if it's all the permutations,
however.

Bug and Bus are different brands?  I've never been sure of the particulars,
other than I know mine are the wrong brand but would have to pull them to
figure out what's what.  They work, that's all I care about.

&gt; Tangentially related: has anybody come up with a good way of theft-
protecting their semaphores (other than by not installing them)?
&gt;
I put longer screws in that extend slightly into the passenger compartment
then drilled a hole through the screw threads and put a pin in.  Voila, they
cannot be unscrewed without pin removal.
