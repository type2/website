&gt;I believe that one of the conversions available for Type 2's was a van that
&gt;could be expanded(?) to show movies or at least public
&gt;information/instruction films.

&gt;I have looked through my various books and never been able to find out
&gt;details of this conversion apart from the fact that it existed. Does anyone
&gt;have any pictures of such a van on-line ? or better still a drawing ? or is
&gt;able to tell me of a book with these in ?

&gt;At the moment the most I am likely to do is make a model of one, bit who
&gt;knows perhaps someone might consider building the real thing. How about
that
&gt;for an unusual project !
