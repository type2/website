Hi Adrian,
Not necessarily!  If it leaks at the throttle shaft it could be the carb is 
pouring too much fuel down the intake manifold.  It needs to be rebushed if 
the throttle shaft can be wiggled up and down or front to back on either or 
both ends more than .015&quot; (About 0.4 mm).  Eric&amp;Barb
