My formula is this. Put a block off plate in the dash or leave the stock radio. I
then built a custom box for on the parcel tray for the deck (Alpine CD player).
The mids go into the kick panels under the dash with tweeters hidden under the
headliner above the windshield. I run two amps that are under the front seat. One
runs the mid and tweets and the other runs the pair of 10&quot; woofers under the back
seat. If you are tight on space the amplified Bazooka bass tubes work well and
don't suck up much space. They are a little boomy for my taste but they also don't
eat up all of your storage space. This gives you a killer sounding system that is
hard to see from outside the car. If you think that subwoofers are only for
impressing teenagers and pissing off neighbors while cranking hardcore rap you
need to listen to some good classical or just about anything. With the woofer
bringing out the lows and the tweaters up high and seperated you can listen at
much lower volumes and still hear all of the instruments. Yes I said lower
volumes. You should try Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull on a system like this it
rocks.
Hope this helps,
