Subject: Laminated diagram

Girding my loins in preparation of replacing the wiring harness, took a 
color diagram from Vintagebus, went to Staples with it, had it blown up to 
approx 12&quot;x15&quot; and laminated.  Wont get greasy or wrinkled, easy to read, 
and will fit behind my passenger's kickpanel when done.  As Martha says, 
&quot;It's a good thing.&quot;  Wife's idea, actually.
