Subject: [VB] Ohio VW Campout Nov. 19-21
Message-ID: &lt;382F1107.65F8_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Hello All,
	We're planning a campout for this weekend (Nov. 19-21) down at Salt
Fork State Park near Cambridge, Ohio.  It's going to be pretty informal,
there are plenty of things to do in the area though.  The only thing we
really have planned is a short trip down to the Beetle Barn on Saturday.
The Beetle Barn is an all VW junkyard, a rare thing around these parts.
	If your interested in joining us, here's the details:
Salt Fork State Park
14755 Cadiz Road
Lore City, Ohio 43655
(740) 439-3521  Park Office
(740) 432-1508  Campground Office
	There are 212 campsites all with electric.  The heated shower houses
and flush toilets are all still open.  Campsites go for $14 a night, the
loyal pet will cost you an additional $1.  For the specifics give the
campground office a call, they are very helpful.
	Like most state parks they don't take reservations, but I doubt there
will be a problem keeping us all in the same vacinity.  If your coming
give us a call to let us know.  I'm going to try to get there Fri.
night.  Anyone want to caravan down from North East Ohio?
	I really hope some listees can make it!  I get the feeling it may just
end up being myself and John Morris (The two people who put this
together)  Which is fine with me, but the more the merrier!

Hope to see you there,
Aaron Badertscher
