&gt; Ordered a infrared thermo, to take readings all over as needed. Gonna run 
&gt; long wires and run my tach/dwell inside the bus for a while, cheezy but 
&gt; useable.

Hi Al,
That will work fine!  All one really need to know is where 1,500 and 3,000 
RPMs are in each forward gear at what MPH.  Then write this down after only a 
fifteen minute drive gathering this info.

&gt; Yeah, I thought about break in damage at this point, gotta grin and bear it.
&gt; Dumb q for today, the oil light flickers a couple seconds on warm start, 
&gt; idle comes up (1050, engle 100 cam) and it STAYS out. Is this OK? Oil is 
&gt; NAPA Performance 30 weight non detergent racing oil. Temps here unusually 
&gt; high at 85 day, 70-75 night. I figured I was at about 160-170 oil tmep at 
&gt; the most.

Sounds OK, we get a simular effect in simular weather with broken in engines. 
 Would be nice to know the oil pressure from a gauge though.  The 1641cc 
engine we are using in our 1960 panel camper conversion had too stiff of rear 
relief spring (Aftermarket spring!) in it and we were in danger of blowing 
the oil cooler and/or FW seal due to too high of oil pressure ( We were 
barely able to keep it down to 60+Lbs. when completely warmed up in 70+F 
weather!).

&gt; I will be changing oil A LOT for the next 1000 miles, in an effort to 
&gt; prolong this motors life.
&gt; Frankly, If I can get a couple years out of it, I will be fine. After the 
&gt; body is done, and I've learned more, I want to get a 1776 SP with a stock 
&gt; carb, probably stock to another 100 cam, and good heads for some more 
&gt; power. No rush, just want to do things right.
&gt; I must say I blame my motor builder, he could have set this up right for 
&gt; 1700.00 I gave him, at least ran it in on a stand...Not going back there, 
&gt; building the next one myself.
&gt; Thanks for all the valuable help,  AL

We have found that installing a full flow filter makes a huge differance in 
bearing life.  Even if you change the oil every 50 miles the metal shavings 
just keep going round and round through everything.  We think you will find 
building your an engine on your own will have its challenges, but be well 
worth it if you do it right and take your time!
You are welcome, Eric&amp;Barb

&gt; My engine has less than 350 miles on it.  It has low run time, as I kept 
&gt; shutting down and working on it, rather than drive it to pieces. I have a 
&gt; daily driver, so the bus isn't used a lot right now, as I set her up right.

Hi Al,
Well for the next 300-500 miles it probably would be wise to drive it only in 
town for no more than half hour trips.  This helps keep the engine from 
getting real hot which it would do by running high RPM on the highway, and 
with a varied RPM in town polish up the innerds better.

&gt; Sorry for the numerous responses.
&gt; The 120 has EXCELLENT take off, I would never expect a bus to be that 
&gt; subjectively fast. I can drive fine in stop and go, as gearing is torqey.
&gt; I do believe that with his cam (Since a 116 was REALLY hot, too small), 
&gt; that the 50-5 5pilot is the last step, as the 60 doesn't have the idle 
&gt; mixture adjustment screw response I am told to expect.
&gt; One more Q, whats a starting point for bypass screw? What's its range, can 
&gt; it be too far out/in? You're told 2.5-3 to start for mixture, but what 
&gt; about this?
&gt; Al

Hi Al,
It really should end up about 2.5-3 turns out for proper running, but 2-5 
will work.  Much more or less than this, you are compensating for a pilot and 
even a main jet of incorrect size.

&gt; I am doing better tonight, the oil light issue is gone, too slow idle.
&gt; After I run a bit, the idle seems to change, as in slow down. I am really 
&gt; thinking I need a smaller pilot, getting a 55 to try.
&gt; The engine isn't too hot now, power and response good, I even did 5 miles 
&gt; on highway, at 55-62mph. Plenty of pedal left, but I am not trying that 
&gt; out.
&gt; Thanks for your help. Tommorrow I wil yank a plug or 4 and see what they 
&gt; look like, and tune the carb for a smoother idel, slightly faster. She 
&gt; seems to like 1000-1050 rpm idle the best.

Hi Al,
Sounds like things are shaping up then!  Great!
