i'm sorry if this sounds a little dumb ass of me but as i can only just 
drive and have only been seriously interested in vw buses for about a year 
could you take a minute of your time to explain and give dates to all of the 
vw camper types?  i've heard of different models such as westfalias and 
barndoors but have limited knowledge of them and the other versions. a 
complete guide of all busses would be greatly apprecciated .  cheers in 
advance
