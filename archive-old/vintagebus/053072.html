Subject: Re: [VB] safrais and tar/glass seals

If it leaks between glass and fram, tar will help

if it leaks between seal and body- probably- I haven't done that

if it leaks between frame and seal on body, not unless you want to seal the 
safaris closed.  Safaris leak.  even if you have og safaris and NOS seals.  
With new fresh NOS seals, it barely drips in heavy rain.  Seeing as I can't 
get new NOS seals every couple years, I resorted to removing the safaris and 
installing regular windows for the rainy season.

Rolling up shop towels with a rubber band and hooking that on the safari 
latches catches a bunch of the water.

You could also try moving to Arizona

&lt;&lt; Do you use the same tar for the safari seal?  My Izzies safaris leak like
 they're open when it rains.

 &gt;   I know this from swapping the safari window in and out of my 61 (when it
 &gt; has the stationary windsheild, it gets the roofing tar)
