Maybe it just depended on the person(s) setting up the paint machines ect.
Looking at pictures from the VW factory back then really gives you an idea
how MUCH of the work was done by hand. So maybe &quot;Ulrich&quot; painted the top
color first 'cause &quot;Gustav&quot; liked masking it off, while &quot;Klaus&quot; liked doing
it the other way, so &quot;Ulrich&quot; painted the bottom first for him. 

These WERE humans building our cars. You can't always put a tried and true
formula with exact dates on some of the procedures and parts used on the
cars. 

That's my opinion on the subject. I think you could drive yourself (and
everyone else) crazy trying to make exact sense of some of it.
