Subject: Re: Weird 28 PICT

Hey Kevin,

               Maybe mine is missing parts. Mine doesnt seem to have the throttle
return spring as this one does. My throttle return spring is hooked to a tall bracket
that bolts down to one of the fuel pump bolts. It has a couple of bends in it and
the spring is horizontal coming straight back tword the engine compartment lid. 
Mine also has the ceramic 6V choke element. This carb on e #$Y looks like it has
a choke element off of a 30 PICT or later and I know the later choke element will
not fit in the hole because I tried. Mine also doesn't have what looks like to me
an idle cut off solenoid. Very different from the carb on my bus which is a PICT
28.
