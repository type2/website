&lt;&lt; ew wiring harness, hooked it up, but the parking lights stay on with the
 headlights on, is this a problem with the way it is wired, or is the switch
 bad? The truck has just been painted and being put back together, so I do not
 know the previous history of the switch. Asking for a friend.
         &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
What year is the truck?  Was it for the european or american market?  If it
was for the european market it seems that switchs were designed to keep the
front running lights running with the headlights.  Eric &amp; Barb
