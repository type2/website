One question: could I have undone the four bolts on
the square bottom plate on the steering box (the plate
the horn wire comes out of) and retrieved it there? I
wasn't sure what else was under that plate.

hey J that sucks about the w key fallling in, but I think you did the only 
thing you could (short of removing the column and shaking it up side down)

it you remove the late at the bottom the old oil will fall out, but there is 
not enough room for a key to pass bay the works to fall out through the plate.

Then agian, draining the old oil and refilling it with new is not a bad idea. 
  use gear oil, some mix it with grease.   Let the old oil drip for a while, 
as it takes a while to empty.
