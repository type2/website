I think i have heard that the window expert is at vintage-vacations_dot_com, he
helped me with my ez-camper windwos seals.

what is unique on the ez-camper, that i like, is the fact that the cargo door
panels go from top to bottom, then a piece of trim to cover the window to door
connection. the windows are screwed to the door, kind of haphazard screw
placement...
