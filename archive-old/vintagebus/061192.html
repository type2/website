Subject: Re: [T2] Return to the age of Aquarius

If I were from the legal team from Phish I would sue VWoA so hard that their 5th generation of offspring would still be paying for the lawsuit. They don't make drugs 'heavy' enough to make me want to buy one of these soulless pieces of junk.
Peace,

Subject: [T2] Return to the age of Aquarius 


&gt;   Quote from VWoA on the new microbus
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Styling reminiscent of the 50's-60's Microbus designed to attract Phish
&gt; fans who've grown old enough to have their own families&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;   Just makes me want to sell all my vintage buses for a new one, ya right
&gt; 
&gt;  I'd have to get BACK into drugs to want one of those!
