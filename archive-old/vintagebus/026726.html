Oh, you mean this image:

in thesamba_dot_com Gallery ( http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery )?

I'd be interested too, I took that picture (note my hand-model like
dexterity) but neglected to note the datestamp.  The owner of the clock has
moved away, sniffle.  ;(

I was cleaning up at the weekend and
come across a deluxe clock that I'd
almost forgotten about.

Anyway, it has the adjustment 'pole'
on the back RHS and I remember seeing a
photo on Everett Barne's site where
he describes this as an 'early' clock....

Does anyone know what years it is 'correct' for?
