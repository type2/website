Subject: Re: [VB] tranny retainer ring

Hello Rex    I use Snap-on pliers ,  But the main thing to remember is to put 
the snap ring on correctly  look at the edge of the ring and you will see a 
flat side and a round side, flat side always goes to the outside, Think how 
they make these snap rings they stamp them out creating a rounded edge and a flat 
edge,  I have seen these come out when put in wrong then you have to remove 
the axle again to fix.  Type 4 motors have this same type of snap-ring for the 
wrist pins in the pistons, I have seen these come out and eat the clylinder 
walls all to hell.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
