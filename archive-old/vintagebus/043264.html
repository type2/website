&gt;But the guages act wierd.  The oil pressure guage reads off when the bus
&gt;is ig on, but when the engine starts it pegs.  The oil temp guage reads
&gt;270 when the ig is on, but when the engine is started it reads 0.

Are the two senders close enough that the wires to them could be swapped?
Maybe swap them around and see what happens.

&gt;I think the wires under the bus may be messed up.  Eric where did you 
&gt;get the pre wrapped trailer wire with 3 or 4 wires in it?  Home Depot?

I'm not Eric but I have seen this wire at chain auto parts stores like
O'Reilly, Pep Boys, AutoZone.  Usually in the section with the trailer
stuff.  You can get about 25 feet on a card or sometimes a 100 foot
spool, and usually you can choose either 14 or 16 gauge.  (Since you
only have 2 gauges maybe you just need 2 gauge wire, yuk yuk.)  The
stuff I have seen is four wires (brown, yellow, green, white) 
side-by-side in a flat ribbon.  You can &quot;fold&quot; the ribbon up to get it
through a round hole if you have to.

&gt;Usually requires banging and yelling somewhere in the process too.   
&gt;Call it a b&amp;tch monkey and the old shock will pop off in awe.

I find that cussing in German helps.  When I work on my Ch_at_vy I cuss
in English.  I attribute some of my trouble with working on a Daihatsu
to my inability to cuss in Korean...
