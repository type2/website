Subject: Re: [VB] Have Gauges, Will Question

As an update on my oil pressure problem … much is solved, some remains.

I have a new dual oil pressure relief valve case and was having problems
with oil pressure.  The new VDO gauge I put in confirmed what the idiot
light was telling me and pointed to pressure problems even at higher
rpms.

What I finally figured was that I’m not running my old ’67 case anymore.
 Post 1970 specifications apply so I pulled out my 1970-1979 Beetle
Bentley manual (helps to have a good library!) and looked at oil
pressure relief valve and oil pressure control valve specs.

First off, the only picture with both valves in view shows two solid
(not the slotted) valve plungers.  That was easily fixed.  I pulled the
slotted one I had and used two solid plungers.

Second, the springs.  Earlier manuals specified an unloaded length of
2.44”-2.52”.  That may well work for a single-valve installation only. 
Specifications for this case were for loaded length (44.1 mm) and loaded
tension (12.5-16 lb).

Earlier this week someone asked about how to figure the loaded length to
see if it meets specs.  I puzzled about it for a while and came up with
a low-tech method that at least got me in the ballpark:

1) Find a rod (wood, steel, plastic, whatever) a bit smaller in diameter
than the inside of the spring and longer than the spring.  Mount it so
it stands up vertically (clamp it or drill a hole in something).
2) Mark the loaded length (in this case 44.1 mm) from one end of the rod
and clamp a “stop” there (I just used a small visegrip).
3) Slide the spring over the top of the rod so the bottom rests on the
“stop” and the top is sticking up in the air.
4) Apply weight(s) to the top of the spring to see how many pounds it
takes to make the top of the spring meet the top of the rod.

I lucked out having some dumbell weights of 10 lb and 2.5 lb handy.  I
also had three springs (2.5” 2.6” and 2.8”) from various disassembled
engines.  By putting a combination of weights on top of the spring, I
could see whether it took 10 lb, 12.5 lb, or 15 lb to push the top of
the spring down to the top of the rod.

It turned out to be the longest one, at about 2.8” unloaded length.

Used same technique for the shorter (20.2 mm) control valve spring and
it was OK.

This combination of springs/plungers improved my cruising oil pressure
considerably.  Makes sense, those are specs for the case I’m using. 
What it didn’t do is take care of pressure at idle.  The idiot light
still comes on.

In my mind that leaves two more items I can change without pulling the
engine to check the oil cooler and assorted galleys.  I can drain the
20W50 oil and go straight 40W or I can replace the oil pump with a pump
designed for this case.  I’ll probably do both.

Or I could take the easy way out and just set the idle at 2500 rpm :)

Not sure if any of  you can use this information (and I’m ready for
corrections), it just irritates me when a problem comes up on the list
and the solution(s) end up in pmail somewhere offlist.  Like reading a
book with the last chapter ripped out.
