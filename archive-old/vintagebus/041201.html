Hi David,
    I have attended the VOA show in Michigan for the past several years in a
row . I have only great things to say about how the Michigan Vintage
Volkswagen Club organizes and runs the show .The non trophy, &quot;pass and view&quot;
displaying of different stand out attendees is a great approach.The Michigan
club members really make you feel at home! I have had only very good
experiences with the MVVC.THANKS.
    However, Volkswagen of America's approach to the show seems very
petty.In that
you have to pay for everything.They don't give cheesy t-shirts away , you
have to pay $15.If you are hungry you have to buy a hotdog.Now, don't get me
wrong,I don't expect a free lunch.But when &quot;The Real Source&quot; puts on a show
,there's no admission,free food, free tshirts to all who are showing a car,
an 8 x 10 picture of all winners of there car,etc etc,etc.....Then the 5th
largest car manufacturer in the world, which I have supported for 41
years,can't even help out in throwing a vintage car show .How much would it
cost VoA.,a few thousand dollars to some loyal customers.Granted they do
allow the show on their grounds and open the museum up for free.Put come on
guys,the &quot;Real Source&quot; is totally out classing you !!

 &gt; Hi Bill and Chris,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your comments both good and bad about VOA. VOA is only a
&gt; small part of the fifth largest auto manufacture in the world. The us of
&gt; Volkswagen's logos and trade marks is some thing that is being dictated by
&gt; Volkswagen AG. Going from almost no regulations to having some rules for
&gt; the use of their trade marks is a jump of 100% and that makes people
&gt; nerves.  Because of this I have ask VOA Public Relations if they would
like
&gt; to talk to the groupe at our up coming May 20th show. I have not gotten an
&gt; answer.
&gt;
&gt; The Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club lives in VOA's back yard that has its
&gt; good and bad points that are unique to our location. I do like to hear
from
&gt; other parts of the country with their concerns.
&gt;
&gt; David Cook MVVC Show Chairperson
