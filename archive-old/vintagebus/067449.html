Subject: Old style TO Bearing with a new Clutch?

While attempting to swap the motor (1600dp) from my 71 into the 65, I 
came across this situation.  The motor has the new style clutch with 
all the splines.  The clutch worked perfectly in the 71, and I would 
love to just keep it intact.  The 65 has the old style TO bearing in it.

1.  Is there any way to use the old throw out bearing, or switch the 
newer style one from the 71 bellhousing and use it in the 65 Tranny?  
If not, it would appear that you need to swap trannies if you want to 
use one of these newer clutches????

2.  I do have the old style, three arm type clutch off the dead engine 
I pulled out of the 65, but I have no idea if it works.  If I have to 
use it, is there anything I should know going in before I remove the 
newer clutch, and install the older style?  I have the Bentlies for 
both busses, but all this compatibility stuff has me scratching my head.

Thanks

Don J
