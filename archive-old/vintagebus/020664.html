Subject: Re: [VB] Hatch Bikes Racks Now Available

It says on the web site that they only fit bays but I
dont see what is the huge difference between a split
and bay as far as mounting a bike rack goes.

&gt; This is really great news.  Fiamma is once again
&gt; making the hatch rack for 
&gt; the VW Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be getting a shipment in hopefully by the
&gt; beginning of September.
&gt; 
&gt; http://eurocampers_dot_com/Fiammaracks.html
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to start taking orders now since there
&gt; are limited number 
&gt; available, and I don't yet know when I will get
&gt; more.  You can reserve a rack 
&gt; with a credit card number.  I really don't want to
&gt; take any checks or money 
&gt; orders since I won't be able to ship the rack for at
&gt; least a month.  Your 
&gt; credit card will not be charged until the rack ships
&gt; to you.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fiamma T1 rack is listed as fitting '68 - '79,
&gt; but I suspect it will fit 
&gt; some earlier models as well.  The rack will firmly
&gt; hold 2 bikes and requires 
&gt; no drilling or other modifications.  The rack clamps
&gt; to your rear hatch and 
&gt; allows easy access to your engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; p-mail for more information.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
