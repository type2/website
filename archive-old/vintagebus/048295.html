Subject: basalt grey vs silver beige interior
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

for the april 61 through 64 standard/deluxes you got either como green,  
basalt grey , or silver beige interior colour scheme according to the parts 
list. 

          como green is easy to tell from the others as it is green  and 
comes in the turquoise/blue white buses.
   the mouse grey/white get basalt grey in standards and deluxes. 
           the SWR/BG buses get basalt grey if they are standards and silver 
beige is they are deluxes.

but what is silver beige and what is basalt grey?   theoretically my april 61 
SWR/BG deluxe should be silver beige.  but the stuff which is in there I am 
so sure is original (riveted on behind bulkhead for example) is the same I 
have seen in standards (grey /white and swr/bg) of that same time period 
which should be basalt grey.   same pattern as como green but grey.  so what 
is the deal?  any one ever notice this?  

Clara
