Subject: Raistrick &amp; Steve Sands heads

I am more than a little disappointed in David's attitude in regard to the 
heads he got from Steve Sands...
Back in March David's engine &amp; tranny were on their last legs &amp; he was 
needing them rebuilt.  David was unemployed at the time and had about 
$600 to get back on the road.  He brought his tranny &amp; 5 head cores up 
to my place.  The two of us cleaned &amp; quickly inspected his 5 cores and 
2 of them were marginally rebuildable.
We took them &amp; the tranny over to the tranny rebuilder's shop, removed 
some valves &amp; decided even they were not good cores for rebuilds.  The 
tranny rebuilder said he thought he had some single port cores that he 
would give him for no charge.
Steve later asked me what Raistrick wanted done to the heads and I told 
him to put new valves, new guides, and clean up the sealing surfaces if 
they needed it.  That is exactly what Steve did &amp; is exactly what David 
was charged for.  I thought that with David's limited budget and Steve's 
labor rate, that replacing the studs was within David's abilities 
(especially since David was unemployed &amp; had more time than money).  
In retrospect, I guess these were not Raistrick's wishes.  I should have 
inspected the cores Steve got from the tranny rebuilder, but I did not 
and I take full responsibility for that.  I have already emailed David 
twice, telling him I would make things right but he has not responded.
I understand his frustration with not being able to bolt on his heads 
this weekend, but I feel he should have talked to me or Steve before 
slamming Steve in public.
I am especially disappointed because I tore down his tranny (including 
reduction boxes), cleaned it, and assembled almost everything except 
the gear stacks in it for free so he could have a tranny with all new 
bearings (including pinion bearing, differential bearings &amp; reduction 
box bearings) within his budget.
I just wanted to clear things up and let people know that Steve Sands 
and Pro-Flow Racing are reputable head rebuilders and if Raistrick had 
paid for anything besides new valve &amp; guides, he would have gotten that. 
I have had 8 sets of heads done by Steve and I have zero complaints.

Respectfully,
Dave Easterwood

PS: almost nobody puts valve stem seals on new valves &amp; guides, because 
they only help if you have worn guides... by the time the guides have 
worn enough to need them, they become hard &amp; don't seal...

PPS: This is the only list I am on, so if Raistrick cross posted his 
message to any other lists, I would appreciate this message being 
forwarded.
