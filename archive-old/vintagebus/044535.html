Subject: Re:  No title for bus
Message-ID: &lt;a1d307fa.248cd221_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

was writ:


I have a bus with no title or registration.
How can I get it titled?
I live in Wa. state and the bus has Ca. plates.
It's been sitting for 15 years and nobody know who owned it last.
Can I take the title and ID plates from a junk bus or will I go to Jail?
It's a good bus but if it's a hassle to title I will use it for parts.
Thanks!

you need to call the highway patrol.  Here in WA you get it declared an 
abandoned vehicle, then take the slip the HP gives you and go to the 
inspection station where they verify the car has its numbers.  You can tow it 
in.  Then to the DOL, where they will issue a temporary title.   If noone 
shows up in 3 years with proof they own it, it is yours, you can get a 
regular title.  In the meantime you can register it and drive it, or use it 
as a shed, whatever.   If you really think someone could show up and want it 
back, keep every receipt, they would have to pay for repairs/fixits before 
they reclaim the vehicle. 

Been there, done that, takes a while to get the HP out to bother (at least in 
this county) though so call now.
