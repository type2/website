Subject: Volks-Motorsports source of parts and info!

Listees,

  I just wanted to touch base with the list and let people know that know me
or those I've not met yet, that things have changed at Volks-motorsports and
I now will be maintaining and responding to e-mail on a regular basis.

  We went through some growth recently and now the oppurtunity to run the
site full time is possible.  Many updates and new info will be happening on
the site in the near future, but all the parts and information that people
came to love in the past is back with me running the site again.
