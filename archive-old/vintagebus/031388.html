Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Not trying to start anything here, but I dearly love a technical discussion.

My manuals give a BUG tranny from 1961-67 with a .89:1 4th gear and a BUS tunnel
case tranny w/RGB with a .89:1 4th gear. Same/same.

In the split case BUS tranny 4th had a .82:1 ratio. But you also ran a 36HP
engine. The lower 4th gear was needed to push the bus. The tunnel case tranny
will reduce RPMs over the split case tranny.

Maybe I'm a little dense, but can you tell me again WHY you feel this is a bad
gearing combo and will &quot;OVERREV&quot; an engine at 60 MPH?

Can you provide some hard numbers or am I asking to much? VW seems to think a
BUG tranny with RGBs will work, they sold them for years!

&gt; As I said before, if you have a BUG tranny with a BUG fourth, the gearing
&gt; may very well be too short. The fourth gear in a bug tranny is fine with
&gt; straight axles, but it wasn't intended to be coupled to redux boxes. I've
&gt; had this combo on a couple of buses and it ain't good for highway speed.
