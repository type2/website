Subject: 71 Bug transmition

 Can any one give em soem sugestion on the proper mounting of a
transmition on a 71 bug? The baja I got seems to just have the
transmition sitting in there and not bolted down, it also has the drive
shaft joints rubbing on the frame so I need raise the transmition a
couple of cm and bolt it down the raising and bolting are no problym,
just wondering what I should use for spacers to lift it that inch or so.
