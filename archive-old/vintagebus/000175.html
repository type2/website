&lt;&lt; A couple more things...  I guess you are right.  I have a dual relief 
case?  Wow...  I suppose that I must have another relief valve then... &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Probably, best you pull out the Idiot's guide, and figure out for sure.

&lt;&lt;Might some bozo mechanic or previous owner have mounted the cooler errantly 
with 3 copper washers and 2 funny-shaped, light green rubber seals?&gt;&gt;
Definitely!

&lt;&lt;Are the ports in the case a different size compared to single relief?&gt;&gt;
Yes, single relief cases have smaller diameter oil passages than the dual 
relief cases.

&lt;&lt;Is this a special cooler, different from single relief?&gt;&gt;
The doghouse cooler, and modified doghouse for type 4 cooler are mountable on 
any case as long as you have the proper parts to mount them on.

&lt;&lt;Does this change my options for the dog house fan shroud and type 4 
cooler?&gt;&gt;
 No, just as long as the proper parts are installed.

&lt;&lt;Finally...  what oil pump/filter combo are you mentioning?  I am not clear 
on the
 set up. &gt;&gt;
Oil pump with aluminum cast cover that allows the direct mounting of an oil 
filter.  No line to blow, very little fuss, or muss.  The only problem right 
now is that the manufactures have the filter go off to the left side instead 
of the right of the oil pump.  On the left there is a preheat tube coming out 
of the front of the muffler that gets in the way.  We have had to cut, weld, 
and redrill the filter casting to allow the filter to miss this pipe.  A bit 
of a bother, but in the long run it saves the bearings increasing thier 
longevity to about double, and not allowing the oil cooler to get full of 
shaving when the engine might finally go bad.    Eric&amp;Barb
