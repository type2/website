The show in question is Mystery Science Theater 3000.  The bus is a fairly
recent addition (last 2 years I think)  FWIW, this is the last season of new
shows.  I for one will miss it.

was a cartoon 21/23 window flying through space with the evil women in
it then a side view it looked like a combi, had rocket engines on side then
an interior view, showed a real bus with the evil women steering wheel
moving and all, even had a radio (not one of mine) cool though, will try to
find tv guide to find out real name of show, all this was in the opening of the
show.
