        BRAKE-ADJUSTER REPAIR


The adjusters used on VW brakes -- the so-called
'starwheels' -- are fitted with a detente fabricated
&gt;from a leaf-type spring.  The spring is attached to the
adjuster housing by metal ears which are stamped flat
to hold the leaf spring in place.

One common artifact of the age of our buses is that
these leaf springs are often missing, having failed due
to rust or broken off during a careless brake job.

The repair procedure for the detente spring recommended
by Volkswagen involved the use of a specially shaped
replacement spring which was installed on the backing
plate using pop rivets.  This was a pretty good fix...
assuming you had the repair kit, which included the
specially shaped springs, a drilling template and the
pop rivets.

But most mechanics didn't have the kit, which was not a
common dealer-item in any case, although the dealer
would order you one.  Lacking the kit, mechanics came
up with a variety of fixes, some which emulated the
'factory' fix, others which attached the replacement
detente spring in the original location atop the
adjuster block.  That's what I did.

I would drill &amp; tap the adjuster block to accept a pair
of 4-40 Filster-head machine screws, make up a new
detente spring with matching holes and simply screw it
into place, trusting to a liberal application of high-
strength loctite to keep it secure.  It probably wasn't
as good a fix as the recommended method but it
worked... assuming you had the screws and the tap.  And
the spring.

The leaf spring was the real problem.  Given high-
carbon steel, a good mechanic could shape &amp; temper a
suitable leaf spring but that sort of mechanic has
become a bit hard to find nowadays.  When I first wrote
up this procedure I recommended using the leaf spring
&gt;from the track-wheel off the bottom of a sliding screen
door... then had to answer a zillion messages from
folks who had never SEEN a sliding screen door :-)

Fortunately, most folks didn't have any problem.
 Sliding screen doors are pretty common
here in southern California, where air-cooled
Volkswagens remain both popular and plentiful.  The
replacement track-wheels are sold in blister paks at
most large hardware store and the spring on one track-
wheel is long enough to make at least three VW brake-
adjuster detente springs.  The procedure, as I
described, was to cut the spring to length, cold-form
the detente in each end then drill suitably spaced
mounting holes.

Several people took the trouble to write, saying the
procedure had worked okay for them.  But there were
others, especially those in colder climates, still
lurking about the local hardware store looking for
those non-existent track-wheels :-)

So use a tine from a leaf rake!

About a two weeks ago I needed a leaf spring for the
frizzen of a flintlock I've been building.  It didn't
have to be very strong but it did have to be the
traditional V-type leaf spring.  Rather than make one
up I went scrounging through the junk box to find
something that would work.  And came up with a tine
&gt;from a leaf rake.  It was bit wider than I needed but
it was good quality spring steel, easily annealed, bent
to shape, treated then tempered.  Worked fine.

It wasn't until a few hours ago, when I was answering a
message about adjusting the rear brakes (actually,
about freeing-up the adjusters) that I realized the
spring steel tine from a leaf rake would also serve as
the detente spring.  More importantly, folks in colder
climates, where sliding screen doors seem to be rare,
would probably have an easier time tracking down a leaf
rake than a track-wheel.

The same rules of fabrication apply although you might
need to file the tine to width.  Or you may be able to
bend the tine so as to allow it to be formed into the
shape Volkswagen used on their replacement detentes
(kinda like an 'L'... you'll figure it out when you
examine the relationship between the backing plate and
the adjuster).  If you try the VW version, be sure to
use stainless steel pop rivets -- aluminum rivets won't
be strong enough and zinc-plated steel will eventually
rust.

So if you don't have sliding screen doors, go look in
the garden shed -- your leaf rake may be able to
provide that elusive bit of spring steel needed to
repair your brake adjusters.
