Subject: Bus rescue/salvage help in N. O.C.

Its the season for giving right?  Well, I could use some help pulling a
bus out of pile of junk on a lot near me.  Now, this is no diamond in
the rough...its strictly a hunk of coal, but its free and I could use
some parts from it.  Its a mid 60's kombi that is mostly striped, cut
wheel wells, smashed front, no glass, no tranny/RGBs, no interior.  Its
bad, but I need the back half of it and  there is still quite a bit of
metal left for the taking.  I'm not sure about rust, but this is So. CA
so I'd be surprised if it was a rust bucket.

Is anybody interested in helping out?  I'm willing to give you all the
left over parts off the bus when I'm done with it, as well as beer/lunch
ect. for the day :-)   Here is what I need:

1. Some way of getting the rear end rolling.  I was thinking of a dolly
like Rex made ( http://www.type2guy_dot_com/62/62.html ).  I'll make one if
I have to.  Hitting the pick a part tomorrow for fwd rear ends.

2. A trailer with a winch (or a come-a-long).  I'll rent one if need be.

Well, that's it.  If you don't have either but just want to lend a hand
and a bit of muscle thats great too!  The more the merrier.  It'll be
available either the 26th or 27th or the following week.  

Respond to me privately if you're interested and we'll coordinate the
rrescue/salavge mission.


Thanks a bunch!!

Steve
