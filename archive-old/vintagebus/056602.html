Subject: Re: [VB] filling in the numbers on a case.

I looked into this a while back and found that Joe ruiz does block
stamping. check out this pic of a case he re-stamped.

He advises to have it re-dipped in that gold chemical stuff like factory or
it wont look as good which he also does (or has done elsewhere?). He quoted
me $350 for a gold dipped case with your choice of numbers, ready for
machine work. (that price was for a 36hp case, dunno on diff sizes)

I've got it in my head that my 57 bus has to have the original numbers
stamped into the case. Anyone ever tried to have the numbers filled on a
case and restamp it? anyone have an nos one stashed away they'd be willing
to sell?
