I have just ordered the Wolfgang International disc brake conversion kit to
put on Rosie. From the description of the procedure, it doesn't sound all
that bad. Uses the stock spindle and inboard bearings. The kit contains the
hubs, outboard bearings, caliper mounting brackets and mounting plates for
stock wide 5 wheels. I also purchased the '71 and later dual circuit master
cylinder and adapter. They recommend you get your calipers and rotors from a
local junk yard. They have these parts, and will sell them to you, but it's
much cheaper to get them locally. This arrangement moves the wheels out
about 3/4 inch from the stock position. I am going to see if it is possible
to machine a custom wheel  mounting plate which will put the wheel back in
the stock position. This kit does not use the brake booster, so the pedal
pressure will be greater than an assisted set-up. I will know more once I
have it here and do the installation. Will post my impressions then.
