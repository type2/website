&gt; as i'm getting ready to build the 1680cc, i've been wondering about the 
&gt; stock exhaust system size; specifically, is the restrictive heater 
&gt; box/stock muffler setup going to put too much backpressure in and hold too 
&gt; much heat in the heads?

Hi Craig,
We have had friends in the past who have run SP dual carbed 1776s with stock 
bus mufflers with no problems at or less than 4,000 RPM.
