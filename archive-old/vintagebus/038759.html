Hey gang!  We made it!!!  The buses worked their butts off but did get us
here in one piece.  Don Boneau is our host while we're here.  The weather is
great and I'm stoked.  I know the days are gonna breeze by before I know it
but I'm gonna enjoy them all!  In our posse is Rick Taylor, Rob and Justin
Laffoon, Dan Kinsey and myself, No Quarter.  Hope to meet up with as many of
you as possible while we're out here.
