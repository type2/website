 (4) License light lenses 211 943 131
 ( &gt;&gt;

while looking up this number  I found that the USA liscence plate lens  
pieces for the US market buses all had M 164 listed in the 58 parts list, in 
the later 60s parts list it was not.  THe later 60s parts list shows m164 as 
sliding door for deluxes, which option was not ( i belive ) offered in 58.  
The 58 book which implies that M 164 is US spec does not have an M code list. 
 Does anyone have an Mcode list from a 58 Parts List?   What does it say M 
164 is? didn't someone just say they had this on some bus that did not have 
sliding doors?  a truck I think.
