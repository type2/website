Subject: Greenville SC area bussers

We had our local Bus club meet at Denny's today. This one wasn't as
heavily promoted as last month's, and the weather was cold today, so we
only got 8 or 9 buses, but we got a couple of new people to add to the
registry. Copies of the registry as it now exists were distributed to
all participants, as well as information about upcoming events like The
Hippy Days road rally and the first annual Paddy's Wagens campout
celebrating St. Patrick's day.

We will do the next meeting on March 11 (Saturday) at 1pm at Denny's
(Wade Hampton Blvd., Taylors, SC), which we will be promoting more
heavily...

C'mon folks! Clubs like these are an invaluable resource, especially for
those of us that are parts/knowledge challenged! Our local club is for
all VW buses from Barndoor to Eurovan and everything between... Contact
me for details...
