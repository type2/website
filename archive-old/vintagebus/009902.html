&gt;Any guru's out there with old VW manuals?  Would like to know the date VW
first made their crew cab (as opposed to Binz making the crew cab)  Would
like the Date and chassis number if available.  I couldn't find it in my
Progressive Refinements.
&gt;
From the Volkswagen Parts Manual referencing M16 - the option code for a
Double Cab:
&quot;Up to Chassis No. 397 288, as well as a further 35 vehicles between Chassis
No. 397 347 and 415 969, the Double Cabs were built by Messrs. Binz &amp; Co.,
Lorch/Wuertt., Germany.  These vehicles have a wider cab door.&quot;
(On my Binz page)

Progressive Refinements says:
3 Nov. 58 - 404 236 - VW Pick up - Now: With Double Cab (M-16)

A couple lines down in Progressive Refinements:
3 Nov. 58 - 397 288  - VW Pickup - Now: Start of production of Double Cab

So there is a slight discrepancy.  FWIW, 404 236 would be Nov. 3rd, 1958.

So I would go with 397 288...

I once estimated chassis #397 288 to be October 26th, 1958, although such
things are approximate.
