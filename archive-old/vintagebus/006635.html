  Well I went and picked up my new 1959 single cab today,(475 mile R/T)  it
still amazes me a bus so straight, rust free and so old. The major bummer is
that the PO totally premièred the whole exterior of the bus, should I try to
get the primer off to reveal the original paint? But at least he didn't
prime the right headlight bucket, you can see plain as day BLAU written in
yellow marker, or any of the interior. I went through some of the parts
while I was there, NOS taillight assemblies (screw terminal), complete new
rubber (for the complete bus), NOSE slider latches, and every thing needed
to reassemble the bus, Even a new (it is the waffle style front floor mat),
all parts were in boxes from Koch's, WW,BFY and WCM, PO told me all parts
were purchased 6-7 years ago, the bus has sat for over 30 years, always
garaged. Tomorrow I will go get the title and it's going straight to paint,
there is maybe 1 day of prep and it will be ready for paint. Even the front
seats have been rebuilt and recovered, not original but a very nice blue
tweed to match the bus.


serial number   505 701

M code plate

02 09 9
360 176 
UP 261 BLUE 505 701

went out to get these numbers and checked out the fan shroud/generator, the
generator has a duel pulley? has anybody ever seen one of these before?

I'm tired., Ronnie  old volks of az.
