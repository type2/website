I've got 2 choices of tin to use for the right lower rear cylinder 
covers. I put a picture up to show each piece here:

cant look at the pics- newmother board still hasn't shown up (was supposed to 
arrive Fri)  But- I think he means the  little piece on the right that screws 
under the rear tin- the rear tn being the one with the fresh air tube holes 
in it.  The little right undr tin (LRUT)

I have seen ones with a holes- that is if you have the pre hea t pick up tube 
on that side.   As he has a 1600 in a 59,  I doubt he is have the pre heat 
pick p there.   I would, on that bus, ideally use the triangle bracket on the 
left side, and the 40hp air cleaner with the preheat pick up, and the metal 
tube to it.   Also there are aircleaners like the 1500 aircleaners that have 
the breather outlet on the right instead of left- these were for some 63 and 
64 buses with the aircleaner n the left and work with the 40 hp utube to 
aircleaner.  If the aircleaner is on the left, easier to use the preheat pick 
up on the left, and not the right, so dont use the LRUT with the hole.

Question is, is your road draft tube straight down or have a dogleg at the 
lower end?   If straight down, use the LRUT w/o holes or notches. 

If dogleg, you use the LRUT with the notch that goes around the dogleg of the 
road draft tube.  Think those allhave the notches for the 68 and later big 
diameter pre heat pick up that is on the right. 

Hope this helps.
