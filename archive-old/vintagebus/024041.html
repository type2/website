Subject: tire talk

I realize that this is a very old subject with SEVERAL pages in the
archives about this subject but I would like to open it just one more
time.  I just go off the phone with NTB and they said that a Dunlop D60
A2 195/70 R14 tire with a H speed rating would be the ticket.  They are
not 6 ply side walls but talking with him made me think that those type
of tires are a rough ride.  The H speed rating is a stiffer tire that
would stop the &quot;mushy&quot; response in my bus.  Has anybody purchased a six
ply tire and been satisfied with it?  Is it correct to think that a
higher speed rated tire would provide better handling?  And is 195/70
R14 correct for my 66 bus?
