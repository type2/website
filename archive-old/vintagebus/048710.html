Subject: How to get oil pump out?

I'm on the way to splitting the case of the 1600cc DP engine that 
came in my '59 Kombi.

I'm stuck at the oil pump. I've got the cover off and the gears out. 
I DON'T have a special tool to remove it and there isn't any real 
overlap to speak of that I can use to pry it off. So what can I do to 
get it off? I'm in a small town and will go by a tool from one of the 
auto stores if there is something that's not VW specific that can get 
it off. I'm open to ideas. Don't want to have to order something. 
Would rather get it done tommarrow so I can continue. Thanks.
