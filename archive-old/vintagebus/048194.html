correct me if I'm wrong, but if a sundial/riviera style tent with the 7' long 
C channel guide was mounted to the rain gutter above the cargo doors, anyone 
(standing up) that was taller than the rain gutter (5'5&quot; or so) could knock 
their head on the front bar of the tent every time they tried to get into the 
bus.  They also wouldnt be able to stand under the tent if it were mounted on 
the rain gutter.  Unless they were shorter than 5'5&quot; of course.

I dont think it would work to extend the C channel strip straight up off the 
rain gutter because that would create a gap between the tent and the bus and 
we learned at the last Jerome that it's no fun when there's a gap there and 
it starts raining.

If we were to attach this C channel strip to the bus like it's intended, we 
could mount it up 6&quot; or along the curved part of the roof above the cargo 
doors and that way the top of the tent would be 6' + tall and would be 
securely attached to the bus and there'd be no gaps for rain or wind to get 
in through.

I know it's tough drilling holes in the roof of a bus, but the bus IS a 
sundial tent and the tent IS a sundial tent (maybe riviera) and the C Channel 
strip IS original, I dont see any choice but to mount it the correct way.

Does any of this make sense?  Am I off my Rocker or on the right track?
