&lt;&lt; Never done it before.  Any tips or tricks for just changing the heads I

Hi Jon,
If you want to do it right you should check the compression ratio while you 
are in there since the case might have been flycut where the cylinders seat.  
Especially if you are going to install rebuilt used heads that probably were 
flycut which will up the CR even more.  If it turns out you need to lower the 
compression you can not use shims under the cylinders (Which is the prefered 
method with a complete engine rebuild.), but use shims (One per cylinder to 
keep the number of sealing surfaces to a minimum!) between the heads and the 
cylinders.  Using the shims between the cylinders and the engine case on used 
engines will move the cylinders outward and make one or more of the cylinder 
rings in each cylinder travel up and on the previously unworn areas of the 
cylinders.  This will wear out the affected ring/s in each cylinder all too 
soon or even damage them outright.
  Make sure to inspect the sealing surfaces in the heads and engine case 
where the push rod tubes seat.  Clean, polish, and oil these areas to allow 
the new tube seals to move about while seating themselfs when you torque on 
the replacement heads.
