Subject: Re: [VB] Oil strainers-Magnetized?

do these fit with a stock exaust? ever had any problems with the heat from
the exaust?  anyone have any thoughts as to how these compare to the
&quot;factory&quot; filters that mount at the cooler as far as ease of maintance?

&gt;   All of these are completely beat for filteration by a good quality oil
pump
&gt; with oil filter stand cast into it's cover.
