Subject: Re: [T2] Dead engine in Miami-WTB used cam or maybe even
  complete used  engine

&gt; Hello List &amp; especially listees in the Miami area
&gt;
&gt; I was on my way down I-95 to visit a friend here in Miami, FL in my '60
&gt; camper when the engine stopped - no horrible noises or anything, just complete
&gt; silence.  I managed to make it to the side of the road without getting killed --&gt;
&gt; a miracle given the fact that I was suddenly JUST COASTING in the middle of 3
&gt; lanes of insane south Florida traffic.  The compression test convinced me that
&gt; I wouldn't be fixing this problem on the side of the road.  Got the free 70
&gt; mile AAA tow the rest of the way here &amp; pulled the engine apart in my friend's
&gt; garage.  The cam gear (flat face type) in my 1600 is completely thrashed.

Well my wife and I just got back from bringing Bill a cam. I had one in
the pile of things I cant ever seem to get rid of.
His was as toast as Ive ever seen. The teeth are just gone on around half
of it.
We hung out and gabbed for a few hours, enjoying the company of Bill and
his pal Royce.

Hopefully it will get him going and back to Indiana.
His 60 has a lot of mods. A deluxe suroof graft, upper panel vents
removed, couple of window frames grafted in with awning windows, homemade
interior including a later zbed, comfortable bus.

Good conversation, good company, a few beers and a bus= good times.
