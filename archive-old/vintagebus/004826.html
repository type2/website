No, but I have got a ticket for going 55 on I-5 in backersfield!  No
traffic, speed limit is 70!  I was
on the right hand lane.  Son's of Guns!

Also a field dui test, search of my van...

No drugs, no brew, just a happy driver until I saw them on my tail!

&gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What is
&gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
&gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers with
&gt; hardware.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I just got 75mph today on my new 1600 (downhill with the wind of course).
