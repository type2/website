&gt; &gt;In the new 12-2000 VW Trends, ...  go into What
&gt; &gt;A.I.R.S. is and direct you to the website encouraging people
&gt; &gt;traveling in VW's to download the contact info. There it is.....

&gt; &quot;DUUUUUUUDE -  my engine fell out onna way to see Phish and Shakedown
&gt; Street... can me and my 8 buddies and our dogs rebuild it on your kitchen
&gt; table and crash in the yard??? We'll make some beans for you!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Be interesting to see how many folks bail outta AIRS :)

Because of course, we only want to help the cool, special people with VW's. We
would never want to help any of those nasty hippies, just because they happen
to drive a bus. We only want to help the few privileged people with busses that
happen to be on the internet, and be cool. As I recall the young lady who
unfortunately lost her life only learned of A.I.R.S. from someone she met in
person, and was in fact, the same type of person against which people so often
speak here on the list, traveling with dogs, etc.
 I get tired of the anti-hippie bus sentiment I see here a lot. I have been to
many Dead, Phish, and other touring-type shows. When I got my first bus, I
didn't know a thing about it. Yes, I even broke down in New Mexico, and through
NEATO got hooked up with a great person who helped us tremendously with the
bus. But, we also went out of our way to be good guests, and did cook dinner
(not beans), and were very grateful. Now I have built engines, and even busses,
from the ground up.  Sure people do dumb things to their busses if they don't
know better, but that's not limited to hippies, or any other group of people. I
have helped a lot of hippies with bus problems at shows. I have also helped any
other person I've seen in automotive distress when I could help, be they young,
old, rich, poor, driving a VW or even (gasp) some other brand of car.
Let's not be so selective in the people we help. Or, speaking as a hippie,
&quot;Share the Love, man&quot;
sorry for the rant...
