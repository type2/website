A friend of mine (in the UK) told me how his parents had hired out their old Morris Minor woody wagen that they had forever, I remember them having when I was 4 and played Mah Jahng with them, to a company for some sort of tv ad.   it came back with the suspension all messed up, and when my friend saw the ad, and the way they drove it over the curbs etc it was clear why.   The pay for the ad didn't quite cover the repairs needed.  So, do be careful because of course you care more about the old bus than they do, and do know whether or not they will drive it and make sure they will pay for any damage done while they have it.  

 Then again, it would be a kick to have your bus in a movie or on tv or whatever.

&gt; Good Money?? Doesn't that convert to about $200 or $250 a day??
&gt;
&gt; If I were putting my vehicle in a commercial, my contract with them
&gt; would have to stipulate that I be there. And my day rate is at least
&gt; that much. Personally, I don't think anyone should provide a vehicle
&gt; unless the day rate is at least $400 These people (ad men) can and
&gt; should pay adequately.

I know what you are saying, but I'm, a bit of a slag and figure that I'd
rather have
the £100 than someone else, and besides my bus isn't a show winner
so I'm not too worried about it.  As you say they need me more than I need
them
so I figure thet they're not going to upset me too much.  The guy in question

is not an ad company so it's not a one-off call.  I've supplied my bus a few
times
and I'm happy with my reward - I've not got the only split bus in the uk so
they'd
find someone else if I said no and I'm keen to keep in with the guy because
it leads
to other jobs and contacts.  I am however, a little shy when it comes hiring
out
the pickup because it's shiney  : )
