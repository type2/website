Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] retractable seatbelt installation webpage

... Has anyone got a good way to put seat belts in the back of a 70 westy. I can
&gt;&gt; see that replacement of the front is not bad but what about the back seat,
&gt;&gt; with the cabinet by the door side?
&gt;
&gt;Sam there are 2 sets of seatbelt mounts in the perfect position under the
&gt;rear seat. They are probably plugged with a rubbery vinyl.
&gt;andy

true for lap belts, but i have to admit i'm not sure how to put a
retractable reel in there with that cabinet. my best guess is that the
shoulder-harness would be hard due to cabinets or other furniture, but
there are several types of retractable reel lap belts that should fit under
the seat as andy says.. you could get these from almost any modern car; i
pulled a set from a 90's bmw abandoned in front of my house some time ago,
and the rear lap belt reels were mounted on a flexible strap. you could
prolly rig it up pretty easy.

if ya do (or if someone has added retractables to a westy), shoot pics and
we'll add it to the web page.

if we get it good and comprehensive, it'd be a nice addition to the
Library.......
