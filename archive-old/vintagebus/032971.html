Subject: '65 Panel in junkyard, San Jose.
Date: Tue, 22 Sep 1998 09:58:27 -0700

Hey all,
	
	I was at the one of the local &quot;Pink-n-pull&quot; Yard yesterday and they
had a '65 Panel in the yard.

	It was pretty well stripped, 

	But the remaining hightlights are...
	
		Bench Seat divider 

		Bench Seat Rails

		Cargo Doors (with holes cut for windows)

		Front beam (without leafs and spindles)

	That's about it.

	I remember people asking me about a bench seat divider, well, here's
your chance to go out and get one!!!

	GOOD LUCK and P-mail if you have other questions.

Roger N.
