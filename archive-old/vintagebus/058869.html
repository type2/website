Subject: Frankinfrugly bus runs

  Today I got the Frankinfrugly buses engine started. A great chore if you
saw how a 4 cylinder iron duke was installed in this beautiful work of art.
The next chore (and I mean chore) will be to get the fuel system operating
and then on to the drive train and cooling system, being all the radiator
hoses were robed for other uses in this buses lifetime. Once I get the
cooling and fuel systems operating somewhat properly I will see if the
clutch system and trans works then onto the brakes. The engine still has the
original bell housing and clutch somehow attached to the original VW bell
housing, a true work of engineering genius. If all goes well onto the 5 foot
exhaust stack, a little more primmer and off to the CLASSIC.
