Subject: Re: [VB] AH Case w/ Dual 34 ICT 009 Timing?

30 degrees used to be a good number, then they drastically dropped our
octane!
--------------------- Clip ----------------------
At 30 degrees at 3200 rpms, my idle just drops to 10 degrees and idles at
600.
That seems to be out of my control.
Anybody sell new distributor springs without buying the whole
distributor?
I'd just like to get this fixed without a ten hour tinkering session.
