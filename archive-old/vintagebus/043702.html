Subject: Inner door handle removal
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10104290144480.18801-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

All,

I'm trying to take the driver's inner door handle off of my '64.  I
have driven out the little tapered pin but the handle won't budge
off the shaft.  That's the only thing holding the handle on to
the shaft, right?  Does the handle get stuck on the shaft a lot?
I think the shaft is splined, so I can't just try to twist the
handle to break it free.  I have tried prying the handle away
from the door but no luck so far.

Any tips or suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
