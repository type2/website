&gt;I do have a question that I hope someone can answer for me.  Does the
&gt;exhaust from the oil cooler have to be enlarged to handle the whole flow of
&gt;air?  I can open up the oil cooler exhaust pipe to accomodate the larger
&gt;passageway formed before it but doing so won't really create a larger
&gt;opening  for the hot air to escape.  Does the whole exhaust have to be
&gt;enlarged?  I'd appreciate some feedback on this.


I didn't on mine. Just make sure that you transition down nicely to the
original duct piece. The conversion puts a bigger oil cooler on, it doesn't
put on a bigger fan. The bigger cooler transfers more heat into the same
amount of air. Yes, it would probably work even better with more airflow,
but the air would have to come from somewhere and I would imagine that would
be at the expense of the heads. You don't want cooler oil and hotter heads.
