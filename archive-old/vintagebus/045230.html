&lt;&lt; The filter (sideways mounted off the oil pump) was full of air bubbles.  
just foamy.  The oil we drained out was similary, but not as bad.  The 
dipstick also showed bubbles in the oil, each time we pulled it.  After 20 or 
so minutes of sitting there would be no bubbles.
  This engine has some varation of a wendage tray in it, but i'm sorta 
suspecting that the filter setup is causing the oil bubbles.  Any ideas?  &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Sounds more like you might have one of those oil pumps that do not fit in the 
case properly or the oil pickup tube is loose in the case or the lower end is 
not in the proper position.
  We have run oil/fiter pumps for years now on several VWs, and had no 
problems with air bubbles in the oil.  Just very clean oil!   Eric&amp;Barb
