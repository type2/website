octO has been named as the official pre-show for the classic by the people
running the classic. Go to the classic site and you will see them only refer
to this show. Haven't talked to anyone that will be attending the soto meet.
octo will be where all the vintage cali buses are headed.

&gt;which one should I go to the event that has been on the saturday before the
classic for years or the guys that think they can just put on a show the
same day as anouther show in the same area.  I think that it is wrong of
octa to do this.  SOTO has the dibs on this day for event and soto was
first.  so all the people that are going to octa should rethink it and go to
the event that was there first and that will be a better show.
&gt;
&gt;please let me know what you think
