&quot;Tapping&quot; means to cut new threads in the metal.  A side-effect of
cutting metal is that you get shavings.  Since that's a relatively
large hole, it is possible to catch the shavings by putting really
heavy grease on the area being tapped, and then carefully removing the
grease (with attached shavings) afterwards.
