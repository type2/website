&gt; &gt;From Wolfsburg West I recieved one of their repo air cleaner decals and tryed to fit it onto the top of the air cleaner. It does not fit....... both top and bottom of the decal which curves to match the air cleaner profile have wrinkles top and bottom. it just will not fit the compound curve of the surface. Their is a decal solution that &quot;softens&quot; these water decals and may try this. Anybody have experience with this??

Check hobby shops for this sort of stuff.  They have all sorts of stuff
to work with decals.
