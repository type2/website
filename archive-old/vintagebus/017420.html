During the process of &quot;re-furbishing&quot; my wife's '67
Westfalia I had a conversation in which I mentioned
that I endlessly found glaring mistakes, oversights
and the details kept exploding expotentially. In that
conversation I asked Charlie Hamill how long it takes
him to complete a restoration. He surprised me by
mentioning that he, in his opinion, has never
completed a restoration. He took me by surprise and
then added, &quot;They are ~never~ done&quot;. (Indicating an
on-going process)
My observation is that knowledge is a funny thing. In
Grammar school and Middle school I learned a few basic
things, High School I knew it all, Under graduate
studies allowed me to notice that I knew even less but
allowed me to scratch the surface in one general area
of study. In Grad School I realized how much I *don't*
know but learned to research. Have heard that Ph.D.
work compounds that feeling. 
VW knowledge/experience or involvement in any subject
is the same thing. The more you learn- the more you
learn that you have a lot to learn.

Judging at VW shows has been pretty much of a joke
limited to the knowledge of the judges observation and
scope of thier knowledge. Most judging has been done
by the crowd moving at a power walker's pace. My
wife's '67 Westy has about a million incorrect and
glaring things wrong with it but sucked in a pile of
plaques in it's day. We were most proud of our Kelly
Park second place behind Bob Sowersby's deluxe the
first year following the completion of our effort.
Even Bob's bus had things glaringly wrong with it. We
now have 45,000+ miles on that bus. It's the judgement
of my wife and I that we like our buses pretty much as
they are. We &quot;show&quot; two of them daily. I learned a
heck of a lot attempting to do the '67 as closely as I
could afford to and with the intention of using it.
Having and keeping a bus TDB (TD Bueno) is kind of a
PITA over all. Going full circle, I like my '63 and
'54 because they ~are~ a little whacked and inexact.
Give me the swap meet crowd any day.
