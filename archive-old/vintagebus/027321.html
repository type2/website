Subject: VW do Bazil parts CD for trade

I am currently fiddeling with a VW do Brazil parts CD, and it is
interesting.

The current South American Bus indeed has the ancient king pin front
axle. With disc brakes no less.

Since the current mexican Bus Micro Fiche shows the ball joint axle and
that Bus is also made in Brazil, one might conclude that they produce 2
slightly different Busses simultaneously.

I also did not know that they sell the Eurovan down there, with the VR6
and a diesel engine.
No Vanagon though, they are clever.

Of course some of the aircooled stuff is truely weird. That dual double
carb stuff and that tuck-away muffler in the left rear fender of the
Beetle sure is different for a stock guy like me.

The CD contains the following VW's:

Apollo
New Parati
Beetle (the old Beetle)
New Gol/New Saveiro
New Kombi
Polo Classic
Golf
Caravelle/Eurovan
Kombi
New Passat/Variant
Santana/Quantum
Passat/Variant
Logus/Pointer
Voyage/Parati
Gol/Saveiro


A would like to trade the CD for a VWoA or european one. I am sure there
are runnable copies out there.
My emphasis is on TRADE.

If interested mail me directly.
