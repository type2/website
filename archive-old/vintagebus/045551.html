Geez the list is slow, hadn't checked my emails since fri am and there just 
isn't much there, all the talkative types must be shmoozing it up in So Cal.

 Hi,
 I am having a few problems with the tranny in my 65.  Every once in a while 
in
 4th gear, more often when someone sits in the back, going steady at about
 40 -45 mph it makes a very loud whommm sound lots of base.  Any ideas.  It
 does it infrequently to the point where I can not predict it.  But it only
 happens at that steady speed.
 
 Also the tranny leaks really bad.  As in I need to refill it every 1 1/2 to 2
 months.  I have been reading and from what I can tell it must have been
 overfilled sometime in its life and blown the seals.  Can these seals be
 replaced?  I have been trying to get a new nosecone but RMMW has it back
 ordered and Bus Depot is not answering my mail (tried twice, even put it in
 with an order once). If it is possible would it be better to replace the 
seals
 or wait out a new nosecone?
 
 And lastly might the new nosecone solve the noise problem or should I be
 looking for a new tranny also.
 The noise happens whether the fluid is high or low.
  &gt;&gt;
Cant really imagine the noise.   But you really should get your tranny not 
leaky.  can you tell where it is leaky.  axle boots?   in the bell housing?   
or ?     running it low of fluid could already have caused damage.
