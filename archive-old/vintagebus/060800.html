&gt; I've always wondered: the people who take these epic road trips -
&gt; how do they support themselves while on the road for weeks at a
&gt; time?  I have a decent job (for now!) myself, but I can't imagine
&gt; taking 6 weeks off to go fart around the country in a bus without
&gt; pay.

Become a teacher!  While the supposed &quot;3-month vacation&quot; is a myth (I
actually get 9 weeks) there is enough time to do a few thousand miles of
bus tripping.  After 10 months of molding young minds, you _need_ the
change of pace!  :)

&gt; The money for all that gas and oil and food and parts, etc has to
&gt; come from *somewhere*.  Do they just hit a liquor store in each
&gt; town they pass thru?  Rich uncle?  Sugar momma?  Parts whoring?

In my case, it's called a &quot;savings account&quot;.  If you spend a little less
than you make each month and put the remaider in the savings account you
will have the bucks for the trip.  Kind of like internal energy in a heat
engine!
