Subject: idle adjust?

Hi lists,
it's not a critical issue, but I'm eager to fix it...
My 1641 DP 34PICT-3 motor has an idle rpm of 1500!
OK I tryed to adjust an idle adjust screw (the larger one located on
the left hand side of the carb).
even though I shut the screw off completely, the engine won't stop,
and it has 1200rpm!
I guess the mixture is ok, since the burnt color of the plugs are typical
brown,
besides runs great from low to high revs.
Only too fast idle is the problem.
any ideas?

Masaki
