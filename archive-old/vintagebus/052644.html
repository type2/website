Subject: Re: [VB] help with M-code plate

Thread going around a few weeks ago says its listed in NADA as worth $2650 
'in need of total restoration&quot;.  Myself I really like the so 23 westi with 
the art deco curved corners, real wood, and metal cabinet trim.  Does sound 
like its needs total restoration, thst can be a lot of work.  FWIW myself and 
my then bf drove 500 miles to get a 54 combi, spent 3 days fixing it (it had 
been sitting at least 20 years) and then we drove both buses 500 miles home.  
Just depends how nuts you are, really.   Get a motor,  tires, do a complete 
brake job, (including new hoses), change tranny oil,  new tranny boots, etc,  
oil the door hinges and clean up the electricals, and you are good to go.  :) 
 

You didn't mention the rust though-  how is the rust?

 I just signed up with this list, I have been a list member on the Type2 and 
 Vanagon list for sometime now. What brings me to this list is I discovered 
 an old split window camper that appears to have been abandoned. I found it 
 when my dog got out and I chased him around the neighborhood and low and 
 behold three doors down in the backyard of the house behind it is this red 
 and white camper. I went back today and got the numbers off the M-code 
 plate. I deciphered it the best I could and was hoping you guys could 
 correct any mistakes I made. It reads...
 
 02 05 0
 
 374 A23 168 181
 UL 231 SK 654C 602487
 
 My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is this
 
 2 May 1960
 374 ?
 A23 SO-23 Westy interior
 168 88 amp battery
 181 Chrome hubcaps
 UL  USA don't know port
 231 Kombi, RH cargo doors, LHD
 602487 VIN
 
 I am not sure on the paint codes but I think I got everything else. If 
 someone could look over this info for me I would appreciate it. If any one 
 has any comments on this model year I would like to hear them before I try 
 to acquire this bus. It is in need of a restoration, the passenger side 
 doors have been left open, there is no engine, and the wheels are half sunk 
 in the ground. All comments welcome.
 
 Thanks,
 Nathan Wood &gt;&gt;
