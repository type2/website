Hello everyone, 
	we made it back.  To think, I was nervous about flying before this 
trip, and by the time we finally landed back close to home at Sea-Tac, I was 
like-Good we finally landed, taxi in and lets go home already!  
	It was an awesome trip.  Simply amazing.  The one word that kept 
exiting my mouth was WOW.  We left California on Monday, got to Frankfurt on 
Tuesday.  Beautiful countryside.  Did anyone notice a resemblance to the 
Pacific NW?  At least up where I live anyway.  We went to the Museum, the 
Facory and Herr Grundmann's place all in the same day.  Talk about overload.  
Herr Grundmann owns the oldest most rare VW collection in the world, hands 
down. The very first Hebmuller publicy sold, it's tag is numbered 000005.  
The first four were test cars.  I sat in it.  That and his '46 KDF wagen, and 
his '56 Rometsch, and the '53 split, '54 convertible I could go on.  Man, it 
was cool.  That was the last thing that night.  First thing in the morning we 
were at the museum.  Then the tour of the factory.  We were all on VW 
overload for sure.  Dizzy from all the stuff we'd seen.
	Thursday we drove over to the Rhein River, up towards Koblenz.  We 
walked up to 2 castles, one of which we got a tour of, built in 1200.  Pretty 
old stuff in Germany for sure. Thursday was a tourist day for us.
	Friday we went over to Bad Camberg, about 17KM from where we were 
staying in Limburgh.  Met Herr Lottermann, went downstairs to see his 
collection, got dizzy all over again.  Amazing stuff.
	Saturday was &quot;THE SHOW&quot;.  The show to end all shows.  Jonn counted 21 
Hebs, plus the one or so in the parking lot and the at least one that was 
turned away at the gate because the show was full. Need a tail light for your 
Kubel?  There were like 4 different tables that had them, no biggie(Shaaaa).  
Then there was that '43 KDF that the guy crank started for us.  Criminy I 
could go on for weeks.  But I won't.  One because reading over the e-mail, 
i'm beginning to think it isn't cool to write so much, and two, becuase I am 
extrememly tired and not sure i'm making much sense.  We'll see how the 
response is to this particular e-mail to see if I will report anymore.  Sound 
good?  Hopefully nobody is irked with me.
	Talk to you all later, g'night (or g'morning depending on where you 
live)
