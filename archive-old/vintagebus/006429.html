Hey don't get me wrong. I have nothing against anyone who spends money
bringing dead, rusty VW's back to life. Hell, I've been to Japan almost
every year for the past 8 years and I know for a fact that  their State
inspection laws are among the toughest in the world.

But if your going to bash a guy like Eddie for wanting to buy a bus then you
might as well bash everyone else who has the money to buy vintage buses too.

You can't blame anyone for getting bit with the VW bug...

&gt; &gt; What about the thousands of OG buses that went to Japan with the
Japanese
&gt; &gt; doing all kinds of sh--t to them ? They've done more to drive the prices
&gt; up
&gt; &gt; then anyone one celebrity.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, judging by the emails I have received from Japan on the doc
&gt; project, at least a fair number of them want to keep their buses original.
&gt; I guess they may have driven the prices up for buses in &quot;pristine&quot;
&gt; condition, and have snatched up some rarities...but I think they have a
&gt; right to be in the hobby.  The buses are being taken care of (ever hear of
&gt; their inspections?).  It doesn't seem fair to assume that bus ownership
&gt; should be limited to a select group of people, does it?
&gt;
&gt; Last I checked, good projects could still be found for less than a grand
or
&gt; so here in the states, and I bought a beautiful Westy :-)
