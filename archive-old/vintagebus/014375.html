I don't think you should do it - remember, you have acids created from 
the combustion byproducts in that used oil.  Clara had a 25hp case that 
sat with old oil in it for years, and the oil ate right thru the bottom!

If you have a nice 36hp motor that needs &quot;storing,&quot; I could store it in
the engine compartment of one of my buses for you :)
