&gt;if he wants to criticize NQ he's perfectly within
&gt;his rights.

Damn right!   I'm all for free speech and so forth and that involves having
the freedom to critique and to criticize.  If I'm being criticized, bring it
on. :-)  As I recall John, you've been the first one to tell me when I
shouldn't have posted something to the list and that's a-ok with me!  :-)

&gt; I happen to think Erin's a great guy, but he does sound a little high
handed
&gt; on occasion. Kevin still has the right to disagree with him, that's how
the
&gt; list works.

Hmmm...I'm sorry if I've ever come across this way.  I don't try to be.
Another thing to keep in mind that I do a lot of stuff for others in order
to keep the karma flowing but you never read about it.  Things like the
marathon maintenance day on Rob's SC which never got written up and the 2
guys from California whose bus broke down and I rebuilt the carb and
replaced a headlight at 1AM in exchange for a $7.00 supper.  Not that any of
this matters but I am proud to be a VW owner, driving a bus that I got
running again, and have the capabilities to do a lot of my own work.  When
the shop is done, we are going to have an annual bus maintenance day for the
Buskatiers where everyone will have free reign of the shop - the Craftsman
tool set, air compressor, both sandblasters, bench grinder, welder, angle
grinder, my soon-to-be-acquired pneumatic tire machine, impact tools, etc.
will all be offered for use for free to Buskatier members.  I'm all too
pleased that I can help others out this way.  It's interesting though how my
posting of ads for everyone to see was misconstrued to be an &quot;ego&quot; trip.  I
only wish others could be grateful for me posting the info because I'm not
so apt to post the next little easter egg of info that I find.  I know
people that are like this too - they find something and they shut up about
it and tell NO one.  Maybe this is one of those times where Abe Lincoln's
advice comes to mind:  &quot;Better to be thought a fool than to speak up and
remove all doubt...&quot; :-)
