Subject: [T2] BFY Friend or Foe


&gt;Dear list,
&gt;     About two weeks ago I posted to the list the problem I was having with
&gt;a mexican longblock I bought from BFY parts in Orange. When I got the motor
&gt;home I noticed the the headnut paint had been broken. At some point the
&gt;heads had been take off. I called them and talked to the owner and he told
&gt;me that they took the heads of all the Mexican longblocks to seal the base
&gt;of the cylinders. SO I accept his explanation. All of the list members who
&gt;responded said I should just get a refund. I should have done that.
&gt;    NOW GET THIS! We are building up the engine to put in my friends bus
and
&gt;we take off the valve cover to discover that the adjustment screw top is
all
&gt;mangled with bits of cardboard in the slot. The whole rocker arm shaft was
&gt;bent! At some point this engine was dropped,hardcore. I call up BFY again.
I
&gt;get the owner named Darryl. I tell him the situation. He says get it fixed
&gt;and they will compensate me double. I say no I want a new engine in the
box.
&gt;He agrees saying I should call him on Monday and he will know when they
will
&gt;have one in. So that is where I am. I wanted to keep those who offered me
&gt;advice updated. I also am looking for support from the list. I am going to
&gt;take all of copies of any email that I get to BFY if they try to back out
on
&gt;exchanging the motor. I do not want to blackmail BFY I just want the motor
I
&gt;thought we were buying.
&gt;
&gt;Brian Lanahan
