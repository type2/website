&gt;i keep hearing that a 68-69 type front beam would fit with no major
&gt;changes.is that true.

Yeh, but it'll raise the height of your bus in the front a few inches.

&gt;71 bus beam with disc brakes
&gt;would these spindles and brake hardware fit on a 68-69 front beam,

Yes. Might be a good idea to put the later model disc brakes (72 and on) on
there when you find some in a bone yard. One year parts are more expensive
than the multi-year and the later ones are bigger meaning a little more
braking power.

 &gt;does anyone
&gt;know if the 71-72 bus 5 lug is the same pattern as porsche wheels.

No...it's different.


I kicked around the idea of doing this mod for a while. I didn't want to
have to deal with the height in the front, and I wanted the porche disc
pattern.

I'm currently working on a home-made set-up to put Porsche 924-944 disk
brakes on the front. I'll put pictures and specs on my site when I'm done.
