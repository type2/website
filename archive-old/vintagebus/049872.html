Subject: Re: [VB] Owner's manual folders

&gt;I was wondering if anyone has one those owner's manual vinyl folders from
&gt;&quot;Competition Motors&quot; in CA?  I've been looking for a while but that
&gt;particular one has eluded me.  I'd like to find one for my Bus.  I have
&gt;others to trade, including several German-dealer embossed Westy ones
&gt;(bigger and have more pockets).  I'm insane so I'd trade 2 for 1.  I have
&gt;$ too.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,

How about SELLING me one of your Westy folders?  My '66 Westy originated at
a dealer in Germany anyway, and I recently got hold of an NOS owner's
manual, and I also have a NOS SO42 manual.  Now I just need a NOS
maintenance coupon book, the '66 Distributors and Dealers in North America
book, and the folder to put it all tiogether.  One of your folders would be
perfect!
