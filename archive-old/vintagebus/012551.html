I'm looking for a set of Euro bus headlight glass, or the whole
assemblies if that's what you have.  I'm trying to complete
the &quot;euro details&quot; for my '55 westy.

The lenses I'm looking for are the ones with the fluting and a circular
section in the center, not the ones with the H4 style angled flutes.
If you were to hold the lense sideways (like it's mounted on a bus)
the lines would run top to bottom.

Thanks!

Thom
