Hey Everybody:

I am interested in using some of the &quot;low compression&quot; 85.5mm 
Piston/cylinders with my next engine. These are the style that are dished in 
order to reduce compression.

Anyone out there know what the volume of that dish on the top of the 
cylinder is. I am trying to make some preliminary calculations as to what 
deck height etc will need to be to get the desired compression ratio.


Thanks,
Skid
