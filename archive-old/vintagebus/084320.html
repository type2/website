Subject: re:hot wire at light switch

I guess I should have mentioned...that I have taken the fuse box apart, and
soldered all the connections in it. I have also taken the light switch apart
and soldered the connections inside it. Did the light switch a couple years
ago, and the fuse block maybe two years ago(I'd have to check my records).
My headlights did seem to get brighter-I think the high beam light in the
speedometer got brighter too.

Not sure what else there is to do, but replace the black and white wire. I
imagine the high temp of the wire is due to some resistance somewhere in the
line. Would this also cause my headlights to be dim? I don't see how they
are related-but I'm not an electrical expert...

Thanks,
