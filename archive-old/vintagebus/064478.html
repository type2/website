Subject: naming my old bus, and my old bug

Ok, will all this talk of personalized plates, I'm thinking of getting some
for my VW's.
For my '67, my ideas are:

O2BNAVW
67 DLUX
13OF EM

For my '60, I've thought of

EURO 60
SLOWLAN
36HP VW

I'm not a very creative person, so let's hear some ideas.  My '67 is a
normal '67 13-window.  My transmission is being rebuilt right now as a
Freeway Flier, and I'll eventually have a 1900-2000cc motor built for it, so
it will be somewhat fast.  My '60 is a bone stock, 90% original, 1960
European Beetle.  Thanks.  Oh yeah, 7 character limit in SC.

'58 Panel Bus(will be for sale soon, so not much point in a personalized
plate)
