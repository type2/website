 &gt; Not sure if there are 12V large clutch stepped FWs.
 
 Probably not. Except ,wasn't the 40 H a formula Vee ?!
 
 65-66 Type 2, Type 3 flywheels are 200mm and 6 volts.
 
 but they do not directly fit the 40 H since they have the O-ring.
 The 40 H crank is relieved for .165&quot;  length and the O-ring
 cranks are relieved .365&quot; length , so those O-ring flywheels must
 be opened up to fit the 40 H.
 Mark Dearing has suggested they may be opened up on a brake lathe.
 Just wondering what happens with the O-ring there.
 Eric&amp;Barb have suggested that the centering ring may be removed to
 apply the late release bearing to the 3-finger clutch cover. Interesting.
