&lt;&lt; Also, can the aluminum be filled? My bumper trims have a couple of deep 
gashes too deep to file and smooth.  Has anyone welded or filled these with 
success?&gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
Best to have it welded.
 
&lt;&lt;Finally, how do you get the stock hard as a rock bumper rubber into the 
alumium bumper trims after they're mounted.  &gt;&gt;

Maybe soaking the rubber pieces in glycerin would help soften them and allow 
more flexibilty.  Eric&amp;Barb
