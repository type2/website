&lt;&lt; In performance cars, and bikes, they employ &quot;gas slotting&quot; or drilled
 rotors to dissipate the gas.  It's a religious issue as to which to do;
 some do both.   I have drilled rotors on the 911, and yes, it does make a
 big difference.
 
 What we need on buses are finned drums to help dissipate the heat!

How about drilled, finned drums, and are you going to manufacture them?  And 
my religion has nothing to do with it. :-)
