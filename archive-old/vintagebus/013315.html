I agree ! I even have a '75 Westy that I would trade even for it !

BTW, its for sale.

Well uh Terry, first of all, I think you'll find this is the wrong group to
mention this kind of conversion to.  Buses are really rare because heir
numbers were so much smaller than the beetle's.  The only way I could
convince myself to let you do this would be if the bus was majorly
gone/rusty or involved in a wreck that would render it fodder for a
junkyard
and your engine hack would mean getting it back on the road/strip.
In general, it's really not a good idea to hack a V8 into a splitty.  I'd
try a late 70's bay window or early 80's vanagon as the transmissions re
stronger anyway if putting a big block into a bus trips your trigger.

In the end it's your bus but on this list, we have seen way too many uses
needlessly ruined and you may very well regret doing this about 20 years
down the road.  We certainly may regret it.

Or was this just flame bait? :-)
