I had my  engine tin powdercoated 8 years ago and haven't had any problems. 


Hi Sean,
We have had our RGB axle tubes done in powder coating also, with great  
results.  Both this and engine tin do not have the extreme  tight angles that we 
are talking about.  Though where the intake  manifold and the heat riser tubes 
meet are in that category.
