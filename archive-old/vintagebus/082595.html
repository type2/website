Subject: Re: Surface rust removal

Hi,

Threads like this always get very good responses. Just wanted to throw 
in that I collected a number of list members opinions, and others 
around the internet and created an article. It is a popular &quot;About_dot_com&quot; 
link:

http://dualport_dot_com/bustech/rust.html

Feedback is welcome.

I have used a number of products. The 3M sanding disc/pads work well, 
however their size limits the speed at which you can work around the 
bus. They came out with a double-sized version that is good. I found 
this the most useful for working around the drip rail. Look past the 
&quot;better than sandpaper&quot; products that work with palm sanders - the 
media eats up quickly on metal.

There is ALOT of dust when sanding. Get yourself a good dust mask. Last 
time I did this, I held a dry vac near the head of the disc and that 
cut down on a lot of dust.

Anyways, check out the article I wrote and let me know if you have any 
additional thoughts.

Conrad
