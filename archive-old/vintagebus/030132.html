Isaiah,
How long is the &quot;fat wire&quot;?

That wire should be long enough to go uninterrupted from the dash to the
engine.  The sending unit is simple.  It is a washer has the wires attached to
the washer.

If your &quot;fat&quot; wires are cut short, you're in a minor bit of trouble.  I may be
able to help out.  But before we go down that road, just report back the
following:
How long the &quot;fat&quot; wires are and what is at the end of them.  If they are cut,
take a look at the insulation and note the two colors that are used.

&gt; hello all...
&gt; I just picked up an EMPI cylinder head temp gauge (60-140 degrees
&gt; celsius range) and all I got was the gauge with a thick wire coming out
&gt; of the back...and the light bulb in the gauge.  I'm wondering how I go
&gt; about hooking this up.  It looks just like, and is the same size as, a
&gt; bus gas gauge.  it has the 2 threaded posts and the light bulb fixture
&gt; on it just like the gas gauge too... but other than that...it just has
&gt; this fat wire coming out of it.  I imagine this goes to the sending
&gt; unit.  I've never hooked one of these up before...and have a few
&gt; questions.  for one..how does it get power?  does one just run this big
&gt; fat wire to the sending unit?  How should I mount the sending unit...and
&gt; what part of the head should I put it in?  Where can I get a sending
&gt; unit for it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks! - Isaiah
