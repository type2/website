&gt;Just rember to set a price limit for yourself and you will not regret your
&gt;purchace.

Well put.

It's too easy to get caught up in the lust for a treasure, like a set of
NOS early bus taillights.  One NOS set went for $250 (my last-second
strategy backfired when I miss-clicked!) and then a USED set from the same
guy went for $385 the next week!
