Went to pick up my new 1965 pick up yesterday.  It turned into an all
afternoon event.  I left work around 12(feels really good, by the way) and
hopped on my bike and peddled to the train station.  On the train looking
out the window from san diego, first at ocean waves and blue sky then at
the back yard alleys of Los Angeles.  I did notice ?somewhere? in orange
county a place call ?foriegn exports? or some such name with about 5 or 6
type 2's in all states of disrepair in the back lot.  

I was a little nervous on the train because I had already paid for the
truck but didn't have it in my hot little hands.  I tried to call the PO
all week but the phone was either busy or not working.  Got off in
glendale about 2.5 hrs later and peddled to the PO's house.  There it
sat, a little forlore but ready go.  

Got on the big bad LA freeway around 330 and cars where running thick.
The truck was running really well, I also have a 77 westy and this 65 is
way more peppy and corners really well.  I like it.  I kept it at 60mph on
the freeway which left me flowing with the traffic.  Around 40 miles
later(still in LA) traffic got too nasty and slow so I pulled off and
caught a twi-light move.  E*i*y ** ** S*a*e, it was like a wild ride on a
greased jungle gym, OK movie.  Got back on the road around 8 or so and got
myself into san diego a happy man.

Now the guts of the stuff, and some questions
The truck is grey with a really nice black rubberized canvas.  The hoops
are preaty heavy duty metal and go as high as the cab.  The sides are
rolled up then held in place with 3 metal hooks that hold the roll.  The
back also rolls up under the top &quot;canvas&quot;.  This motor was rebuilt by a
shop in april and I have the recept for the work, looks like a full top
end rebuild with new heads, p&amp;c, etc.  How can I tell if this has the
doghouse coler or the regular upright? 

Other needs are a clunking in the front end when going slowly going over
bumps.  Loud road noise from the front(wheel bearings).  Headlight glass
and tail light lenses.  There is some rust on this truck but preaty
surface expect under the floor where it is a little pinholy.  There is
very little rust under the windows.  No locks work, and a couple window
latches need help.  Any ideas for fixing the sliding window latch when the
little nugget that falls in the slot is broken off?  

There are some minor other items that I won't over bore you with. 

Does anyone have a headlight glass for this truck, I don't like water
flying in there?

Thanks for reading
rami
