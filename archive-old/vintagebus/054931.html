Hi AJ,
Kind of depends on what you desire to do to it!  If you are going to be doing 
a immeadiate complete resto and taking it to shops to get work done to it you 
will need at least suspension and steering working properly so you can tow 
it.  If you are planning to drive it then suspension, steering, and brakes 
are absolute top of the list.  After that sealing out the water, the 
electricals, tranny, and finally the engine!   Eric&amp;Barb
