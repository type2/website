Subject: Re: [VB] bus dies a lot.

the carb leaks from the joints where the little arms
move around on. i just went and looked, and the carb
says 12 volt on it. i know the choke doesnt work at
all, i have to manually go back and open the valve. i
think it has a place for the fuel cut off switch, but
im not sure. thanks.
