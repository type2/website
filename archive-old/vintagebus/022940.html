Well, well, well....

Okay, now here's an interesting story for y'all.  When I bought my '63
Camper back in December, the PO removed everything pertaining to the tent
for it.  He even told me he had it, red and white striped, that it was
nearly original, and that he'd like to get $600 for it over what he was
already asking for the camper!  Naturally, I was pretty pissed by
this...the tent came with the camper originally, but now he's keeping it
cause he knows he can get more money for it.  Frankly, I told him no way
because I knew I could get a replacement one from PLF (not to mention it'd
be a tent I wouldn't have to worry about actually using!) for $450.

Yes, the PO lives in Fremont, CA and (looking at the eBay ad) even the
front yard looks oddly familiar.  &lt;smirk&gt;  So I'll bet dimes to dollars
that that's the tent that should be on my Bus.  Although, if anyone on the
list scores it, please let me know...just kinda curious where it ends up.
