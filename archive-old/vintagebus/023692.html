Subject: Re: Barndoor Front Kick Panels Wanted
References: &lt;199806252157.OAA24125_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

  I need the front two kick panel for a barndoor single cab.  Anyone
  have an extra set?  Gray cardboard material.

Wolfsburg West carries reproduction door, kick, and headliner panels in
a material closely resembling the original gray oil board that VW used
in trucks, panels, and kombi's. When you buy the double cab panels, they
sell you the back door and driver rear wall panels that aren't yet cut.
It is a big panel that you have to cut yourself. They might sell this
large panel separately. If they do, you can cut your own kick panels to
fit the barndoor.
