Subject: Re: [VB] New Bus---suspension questions

Congrats on the new bus!!!!  pics? so-44s are cool.

on 66/67 wiper motors there is a nut you can undo (10mm?) then pull the 
splined thingy off,and put it back on so the wipers are parked where you want them, 
without removing the wiper motor.   It is sort of in the middle, probably 
hard to get to if there is a radio installed.   I can try to take a pic and send 
it if this doesn't help.   it's wher ethe shafts to the wiper pivots meet in 
the middle.

go through the John Muir/ idiot book method for investigating what is wrong 
with the steering, and give everything a good lube so FRESH grease comes out.

spindles rebuild do not include new links.    Do you need new links?   you 
really need to take the old ones out to check.  I think new are about $100 a set 
(takes care of both sides).  Keep any good used ones for future spares, and 
keep the pins/needle bearings/bushings together as a set, do not mix and match. 
 Adjusting links and wheel bearings can sometimes take out a bunch of slop.

I've seen bad swing levers make icky noises.   

there were different batches of velvet green that came out slightly 
different.   also, different sun exposure ages the paint differently.  Did you polish 
the bits up?    that colour darkens with age.  Engine compartment colour is 
closer to original.

&gt; I have a new bus.  It is a new old bus, and her name is Penelope.  Penelope
&gt; is a nice bus.  She is a '66 SO44, and the term that describes her condition
&gt; best is &quot;beater&quot;.  She is Velvet green.  Pedal pan still in place.  M-Codes
&gt; state that she should have a dual-circuit master cylinder!  The wipers park
&gt; in the middle of the windows, due to the fact that she has a baywindow wiper
&gt; motor.  ??  She has a solid battery pan, rusted front floors, one non-rusted
&gt; but dented rocker (in and out), one rusted AND dented rocker (outer).  She
&gt; has a solid cargo floor. ...... found the suspension/steering to be the
&gt; classic floppy/loose/scary type.
&gt; 
&gt; I loved driving her home.  She has a great vibe.
&gt; 
&gt; I was staring at the front, with a good view of the front tires, and I
&gt; noticed that the wheels are cambered funny.  That, and the very loud kingpin
&gt; clunking and the strange feelings one gets when steering lead me to want to
&gt; replace lots of things.
