Subject: Re: [VB] Found,  singlecab, Long with bus content

Well, if she owned it and never licensed it for over 40 years because it was
only used offroad, I would say that it more than likely happened on her
watch. At some point her or a son may have decided some big old tires would
be a good idea. Probably getting it stuck in the south 40. I bet you could
find the pieces around there if you looked, with a rusty pair of tin snips
and the original tires and wheels laying on the ground beside them.

&gt; I believe john found what he did and im sure Ill get to check it out soon.
&gt; but isnt it strange that the original owner would cut up their truck after
&gt; only having owned it for 1 year?????????
