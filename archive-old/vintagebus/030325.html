I have not seen definitive proof that all DCs and SCs came from the
factory with the bedslats.  However, from the text in many bus and VW
books I have read, it sure sounds like they did.  Also, every truck
picture I have ever seen in dealer brochures (I have 4 different ones)
shows bedslats.  As to type of wood, only reference I have seen says
'hardwood'.  Nowadays this means oak.

If you have seen a DC or SC without bedslats, my first guess would be
that a PO had to remove the old wood, didn't want to go to the trouble
of replacing it, and just welded the holes shut to keep out the water.

&gt; What type of wood are the slates made from if you want to be a purist?  And
&gt; did all the SC's and DC's come with them ?  Was it an option or std ?
