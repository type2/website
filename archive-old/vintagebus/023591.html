 &gt; people who do their own brakes do so mostly i think because they are
 trying to
 &gt; save money... and us vw people are *especially* famous for cheaping-out on
 parts
 &gt; and so on...
 
 I for one do not do my own brakes out of cheapness. I do it out of fear. The
 same kid we have all heard of that didn't tighten the drain plug when
 changing oil at Jiffy Lube may have moved on to a new job at the brake shop,
 and I don't wish to eat the car in front of me because the shop is having a
 hard time finding good help. Most shops hire one or two certified mechanics
 and then fill the bays with pointy-headed parts changers. The odds of the
 certified mechanic doing your brakes is small. I know a kid who worked at
 several dealers in town doing this stuff. The mechanic would look the car
 over and tell junior what to change. Kid can't even give his own car a
 tuneup, but he can change parts. I bought a new Ch*vy a few years back. It
 was a van so it was a pain to work on. Had the dealer service thing all the
 way along. After its fifth tuneup it was running poorly so I took the
 doghouse off to check it out. The carpet installed by the van conversion
 place was glued up onto the doghouse about 6 inches. It had NEVER been
 removed. The original air filter was still in there in all of its filthy
 glory, the plugs had never been changed, etc. All of the work they had
 charged me for their ASE certified mechanics to do had never been done.
 Which led me to check the wheel bearings they had repacked, must have filled
 them with dirty motor oil if they did it. The 15 shiny bays in the service
 department and crisp uniforms did not help with reality. Sure, the
 perception that the work was being done right was there, but that's all it
 was. The mechanic does what the service manager wants them to do. A good
 mechanic can do consistently high quality work in a shop and the customer
 can still be getting ripped off. If the mechanic does an oil change, he
 doesn't know that the customer brought the car in complaining that the
 brakes were pulling every since the last brake job the shop did, and while
 it's in go ahead and do a tuneup, radiator flush, and tranny service too. He
 only knows that he is supposed to change the oil.

.............................................hm... that just about sums up 
why I started working on my VW, after having something like that happened.  
How many people are going to care about my bus as much as I do, anyway?  A 
friend of mine used to work at a jiffy lube, ended up manager after 3 weeks,  
 stories I've heard would scare you.

then again, if I had ended up with a good mechanic, I'd probably have stuck 
to just doing tune ups.
