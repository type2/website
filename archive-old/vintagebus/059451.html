&gt; Will I create any problems by using the 30-PICT-3 with the 1500 &amp; 009

Hi Chris,
As long as the jetting in the 30-PICT-3 is the same as the 30-PICT-1 ands 
this jetting is correct to the engine size, air cleaner used and engine 
compartment used in then it will work just fine.  If not, then anything can 
and may happen to destroy your engine.
