Thom,

There are many engineers and just generally creative folk on this list...

Perhaps if you describe the situation we can come up with some ingenious
solution that wont involve an airlift...

I know rick taylor has figured out how to get some busses out of some
sticlky situations (one with a tree on one side and a house on the other
and no wheels, if memory serves)

Just tell us the specifics of how its stuck, without enough info that we
could find it ourselves ;)

take care,

Steve
