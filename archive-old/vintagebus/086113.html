Subject: Oktoberbus is coming

Hey y'all
I've been off line for over a month with new job and some travel and all 
but I'm back and better than ever!  I'm here to remind you that 
Oktoberbus is less than 5 weeks away.  If you haven't been to Oktoberbus 
then you've missed out these last 10 years. Why put off until next year 
what a good time could be had this year?

Many real and simulated testimonials can be gleaned from the archives, 
or old Oktoberbus web pages from years past, but why let others tell you 
what it's all about, come see for yourself.

A very good place to start is http://www.maduncledave_dot_com/oktobus06.html

Any questions may be directed to your host, that would be me.  Unless 
someone else wants to be, and how could I stand in the way of someones 
aspirations to greatness?

Mad Uncle Dave
