So this has been bugging me since the first time I ever pulled an
engine:  Why does the fuel line run through the engine tin, instead of
through a hole in the body next to it?

Presumably there's some factory-recommended procedure for
disconnecting it that doesn't require you to pour gas all over
yourself and the surrounding neighborhood, but I've never figured it
out for a stock line (mostly metal, except for some very short
sections of rubber connecting the metal bits together).

I'm replacing the line on the '60 I just acquired.  I'm debating
running it through the body and putting a single shut-off in the
engine compartment, or running it through the engine tin and putting a
shut-off on either side.  The former has the attraction of not
requiring crawling under the bus, fighting to pull the line off from
an awkward position, and getting a shot-glass' worth of spillage on me
or the ground.  The latter doesn't require drilling holes or
significantly damaging the show quality.  I have no particular desire
to enter a show, but....
