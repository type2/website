Subject: Headliner trim strips for dc
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,

I have a 66 doublecab that I'm collecting parts for
the long journey back to being road worthy.  While the
trim strips aren't essential for road worthiness, they
are essential for wife worthiness.  Does anyone have a
couple of the full width strips they would like to
sell?  I have the two for on either side of the fresh
air box, just not the other two (one for the middle
and one for the back?)

TIA!
Paul
