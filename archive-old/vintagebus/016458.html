&gt; &gt; Our hero freed it up and put a fresh supply of 40 weight quaker God 
&gt; Bless
&gt; &gt; William Pennsoil.
*snip*
&gt;
&gt; on the way back out and you still wouldn't be too far into it 
&gt; provided the
&gt; endplay isn't too far gone which would indicate a very tired engine.&gt;

There is substantial end play; I just checked. The thing that gets me is
that the studs weren't loose....maybe the PO tightened it up.
As far as what type of oil; pennsoil was on sale at Longs drugstore and
my FLAPS was closed. I would have liked to put non-detergent oil in it
and quickly replaced it once the motor fired and ran for a minute.
It's hard to get too serious about this motor as i have a fresh 1600 sp
in the bus right now. if this was a matching # for my bus perhaps I would
be more serious about it. 
It's just cool to have my first 40 horse motor, dose anyone know what
they'd or the WB stampings mean?
