Subject: 12V battary tray strap Q
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Anyone have a 66 or earlier bus with a 12V battery? 
How is it straped in there?  I know that the 67 has a
clamp at the base of the battery to hold it in place. 
Were the 63-66 bus's with the 12V option also done
this way or with a longer strap like the 6v battery?

Thanks

Matthew
