&gt; All this fuel filter talk encouraged\reminded me to go back and check all
that stuff on my 66 (with a 71 engine) and to quote Gomer Pyle &quot;SURPRISE,
SURPRISE, SURPRISE!&quot;, my fuel filter was leaking raw gas into the engine
compartment.

     MY MESSAGE: 
 how often do you check your oil?  lubricate your distributor (if
applicable)?  didn't you smell gas?   
  it seems to me that not very many of us look back there often enough. 
it's also sad to me that a discussion on a list prommpted someone to check
their engine compartment.  this should be a ritual!  not that you need to
put a video camera in there to look at all times, but it only takes a
couple minutes to pop the lid an scope things out.  plus i'd think that
even if you'd drive your bus only to the supermarket, you can smell what's
going on in the engine (excessive heat, raw gas, etc...) or glance
underneath for puddles of leaking juices. 
  again, i must express my thoughts---these are old vehicles.  they are not
mazdas, 6cyl passats, or even a (insert your favorite american car here),
with modern brakes, engines, maintenance schedules, etc.
  my owners manuals clearly state: &quot; BEFORE YOU DRIVE AWAY (in big, bold
black letters) please check:  engine oil level, fan belt tension, quantity
of fuel in the fuel tank, tire pressures, efficiency of brakes, position of
the rear view mirror, and,if driving at night or in foggy weather,  the
exterior lights.&quot; 
  now, i may be a snob about stuff, but even i don't do this every time,
but i do check stuff a few times a week, and if i notice an electrical
problem while driving, i fix it as soon as possible, since i like people to
see me turning and stopping. i noticed a puddle of gear oil under my car
last weekend, and yesterday i replaced both axle boots.  a dirty way to
spend an hour, but now it's fixed and i don't need to worry about it.  
  people here have been worrying about driving long distances on their
&quot;mystery motors&quot; lately.  don't you ever do maintenance? you just stuck the
motor in there by means of a magician, and haven't even looked back there? 
you can't just think this is a low maintenance vehicle and drive it without
looking at stuff of performing the scheduled maintenance rituals, and doing
them even more frequently than recommended on some things. 
well, enough rambling.  why not log-off and check out your bus and do some
things that will make it happier, and you sleep better.
