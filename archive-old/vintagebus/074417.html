Subject: [VB] single port v dual port

I have heard that a single port 1600 has more torque than a dual port motor is that true?  Also what is the approx. hp difference anyway like 1-4% or so? ( this would assume same engine builder same carb, exhaust, carb etc.. )

I guess one has to evalute the whole setup.  For someone running moderate carb ( 30 or 31 pict ) and stock vac distributor the difference betwixt a single &amp; dual port is smaller than someone running a bigger 2-barrel right?
