hi there folks -
i've got a couple of crank handles and was wondering what one of them was
supposed to be for - they both came from ealy engines - one is definitely a
54 bus crank handle that came with a 54 bus engine i bought recently.
the other is a little different - and came with a mid fifties (could be
later) engine i bought last week. the crank nut and the dog both look a bit
bigger. i wasnt aware of any difference until comparing the 2.
if anyone is bothered - i'll take a couple of pictures of both if it'll
help.

&gt;
&gt;  Anyone evere seen the elusive July 58 through May of 59 crank handle???
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; is there such a thing?
