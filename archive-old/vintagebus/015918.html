Hi Chuck, its never to early to plan for a VW show ! Anyway my son and I
are leaving Spokane on June 5 and plan on being in Carlsbad by the 7th
maybe the 6th depending on how  many stops and how hot it is as we are
driving my beetle . We plan on doing the whole weekends schedule of
events starting on thursday . More details closer to June .

&gt; I know I'm probably starting a bit early but does any have plans yet 
&gt; for
&gt; Classic weekend?  Last year I camped out at Irvine Lake and had a 
&gt; blast.  I
&gt; will probably do the same this year but I would like to hear what 
&gt; y'alls
&gt; plans are.  Are any of you northwest caravanning down the coast?  I 
&gt; would
&gt; like to jump in with those in the slow lane.  I have had to miss a 
&gt; lot of VW
&gt; shows due to a change in job schedule so I'm getting pretty stoked 
&gt; about
&gt; this years Classic.  Again, sorry for bring this up so early but I'm 
&gt; going
&gt; through withdrawals for a VW show
