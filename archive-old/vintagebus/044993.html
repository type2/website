&lt;&lt; I know why the problem happened....the driver's side rod came out of its
 socket (it just needed tightening) and then fouled the passenger side rod,
 and popped it out....I was able to pop it all back together and torque down
 the set screw for the driver's side rod. &gt;&gt;

And while on this topic, I need a set screw for my 64, does anyone know if I 
could find one on any other VW model?
