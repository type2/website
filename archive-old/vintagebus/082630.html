Subject: fresh air vent lever

Volks,

Its gotten cold enough outside that I decided to take the fresh air vent 
hardware out of the box of parts that came with my bus and install it.

So, I took off the fresh air vent box cover and installed the flapper, 
only to find that the lever used to open and close the vent seems to be 
180 degrees off!

i.e. when i tighten the lock screws down on the flat area of the shaft 
that goes through the box, the lever points DOWN.

That is assuming that the lever is supposed to be on the driver's side of 
the fresh air box.

is it possible that I have the shaft from a right-hand drive bus?  I can't 
figure out any other way to install the lever...

Thanks,
	tom
