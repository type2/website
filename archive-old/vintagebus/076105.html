Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 06-24-03

Got back to the wiring on the '60 DC today. I printed out the wiring 
diagram across nine sheets of paper. Made it look nice and big and 
easy to read.

Using my home-made static timing light/test light, I figured out that 
the front turn signals weren't grounding. I cheated and wrapped a 
wire tight around them on the inside and locked it down with the 
mounting nut. Then just sent that to my own grounding screw in the 
body. Done deal.

So this made both the front and rear turn signals work.

I tested the wire coming to the wiper motor switch and it's getting 
juice. I connected it directly to the wire going to the motor and it 
did nothing. I used a jumper and connected the wiper motor wire to 
another hot wire and still nothing. I didn't test anymore but it 
isn't looking too good. Last hope is that the wire is bad or the 
ground on the motor isn't doing it's thing. Worst case is that I got 
to find another wiper motor or something. Rebuilding it with one of 
those $30 12 volt inserts from Wolfsburg West might be an option.

None of the speedo lights or indicators are working. I'm gonna go get 
some bulbs and put new ones in there. I hope that's the problem 
there. Either way I don't think it'll affect me getting an inspection 
sticker.

So now it's down to the last items before I'm street legal.

-emergency brake
-wipers
-horn
-and maybe speedometer cable

A pretty short list compared to a week ago.

I also need to pull and clean the gas tank, put a bus air cleaner on 
the engine, fix the broken headlight lense, paint my wheels, install 
new hubcap clips, and mount my tires which I still don't own yet.

But darn if this thing isn't coming together good. I guess I'll make 
my list and get on the phone to order some crap tommarrow.

Anyone ever painted flames with spray paint? I guess I could always 
get my buddy to do it for me...he's got an airbrush that he's pretty 
handy with. Would be cool to do it with spray paint though.

That's it for today!
