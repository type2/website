Subject: SINGLE CAB HELP!!!!

Hello, today i was going with my father to try and find a bus we saw a
couple months ago.  well that didn't work out but on the way back we did
find what appears to be a 50's or 60's singlecab.  it has the small rear
windshield and outward facing fresh air intakes so i figured it was an early
60's model. i had no luck locating the paint plat, can someone tell me where
they are on single cabs. any help is appreciated.
thank you, Bryan Dean
