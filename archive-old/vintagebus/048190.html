 I thought I had it beat but I don't. 
 
 I have greased the crap out of every greasable joint on the front end with
 the wheels way off the ground. I did the greasing with the link pins
 adjusted at their slackest and correctly adjusted them afterwards. After
 greasing I manually moved the suspension up and down on both sides in an
 attempt to work it through, wiped off all the grease and regreased and
 worked the suspension. 
  &gt;&gt;
I have had wierd tricky occasional squeaks.  One turned out to be the left 
front tire goinhg funky.   I tend to grease the suspension every 3K miles, 
and occasionally therre are squeaks, but they tend to go away after 
greaseing.  I still have one that didn't go away, it has appeared after 
driving back roads ~40 miles.  I am not worried.
