Any ideas in UD, 195, or 265?

your date is wrong- read it       DAY -  MONTH - YEAR  
  for  3rd December 1962.   Why is this so difficult?

195 is a mystery, and seems often used  on 62s and 63.   wonder if it apeared 
on euro spec buses?

265 is the model number  - middle of bottom line- means truck.  

 Red is Ruby Red- a pretty unusual colour for a bus- available 62/63 for 
commercials, but not used that often.
