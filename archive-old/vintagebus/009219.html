Well, while browsing around the web, lurking, and searching, I finally made
it to Creative Engineering (or back to, I should say).

http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com/products/index.html

Now, listed under their sheet metal repair panels (on the price list) they
mention 'Cargo Door inner repair' for 18 pounds (roughly $25.50). Is there
anyone in the U.S. that handles these parts? If so who?

Also, I just scored a set of Rusty Safari Windows off of an early singlecab.
Does anyone have some frames that they would want to get rid of? Where can
you get the seals for an original set of safari windows?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Charles
