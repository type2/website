I'll second that, the parts of my Dcab that I blasted before sending the
shell to the body shop(lying bastards) received nothing more than a coating
of rattle can primer. It ended up sitting for almost a year and that hastily
applied coat of cheap primer stayed stuck. I'm sure that the increased
surface area left after blasting gives the paint more to hold onto.
