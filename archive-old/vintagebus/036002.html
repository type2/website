Folks,
The project bus I mentioned a week or two ago is available. I spoke to the 
owner last night, and he wants 1,000 UKP for it. He must have that in new 
panels in the bus, nevermind the welding. It's a 59, and still requires 
much work, but a lot of the nasty stuff has been done. Located in South 
London,
pmail me for contact details if interested.

On the 23 window front, went to look at a solid 1963 23 window bus. all 
complete, interior tatty, headliner horribly replaced, blowover paint in 
original turquoise (seats match - nice) /white. Owner wants 8 thou UK, 
which is about 14k US I think. Any opinions on this price ? I think it's 
about 2k more than I want to pay for it, unfortunately I think he'll get 8 
from someone.

Damon.
