You mentioned using a mister on your trip. For my uncompleted Jerome trip =
I made a heavy duty misting system from some recycled parts. It's a 5 =
gallon stainless steel soda syrup tank with a bike pump air-valve fitting =
on the input side and a buy-it-at-home-depot 6 outlet mister hoseclamped =
to the outlet. Most soft drink distributors are changing from the =
reuseable stainless steel tanks to bag-in-a-box systems for their fountain =
customers. Home beer brewers use 'em now, cost about $20 each.
I fill it with 3 gallons of water and put about 50 lbs. of pressure into =
it, you need some air space to push the water. The tank is safe to hold =
100 lbs. of air pressure. The misting lasted for about an hour with 6 =
misters. If you used only one tip to wave around the bus, it should last =
for 3-4 hours. You could even snake a long tube back to the engine room =
with a valve to give a hot motor a cool down.=20
Homebrew shops have the tanks and the ball-lock fittings. I got the =
schrader valve at a general hardware store, ask for air compressor parts, =
and used a short length of tubing that fits the ball-lock barbed fitting. =
A filter is a good idea to keep the tips from clogging.=20
If anybody's interested, I can e-mail some pictures of the setup.=20
