Subject: Purple Glitter Interior Light

With Thom talking about frosted interior lights, it got me to thinking that
I used to have an interior dome light for a bus.  It had the VW logo on it
and it was done in purple glitter.  I thought that maybe it was paint but
when I went to scrape the paint off, I found the whole lense was made of
this purple glitter material.  Mr.VW in Chicago ended up with it but I was
wondering if this was just a really good aftermarket part made from an
original or what.  I should have written down the part number to see if it
legit or not.  It sure wreaked of 70's decor though...
