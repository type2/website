Subject: Re: [VB] pre 60 wire termination... Poll

This prompted a lengthy discussion on the Airheads Beemer list. The general
consensus (sp?) was that soldered electrical connections tend to crack from
years of vibration while crimped connections resisted the constant vibration
associated with motorcycles. I think they were discussing specifically how
to connect the wire ends TO the brass/copper push on connectors, not whether
the wire should use a push on connector OR solder the end of the wire to the
terminal. I'm not sure which you were wanting an answer to, but I would
think that soldering a wire to a terminal not only makes it tough to test
things later when trying to track down electrical gremlins, but also can
cause a sudden failure of the joint IF soldered joints are indeed prone to
cracking due to vibration and age. Just MHO.

&gt; &gt; that all wires were not terminated with those little brass ends.... sure
&gt; &gt; sure, I knew that.
&gt;
&gt; Do these little brass ends make a difference? And are they &quot;better&quot; than
&gt; just terminating the wire with a good solder job? I wrestled with this
when
&gt; I put in my new harness, but finally gave up when I couldn't find any
&gt; locally. Seems like the least amount of material the current has to go
&gt; through, the better, but I have absolutely NO electrical background so
I'll
&gt; just shut up now.
&gt;
