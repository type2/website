&gt; &gt;&gt;You know your buying too many buses when you start adding up how many 
&gt; times
&gt; &gt;&gt;you've rented a tow dolly
&gt; 
&gt; I gave up on tow dollies a long time ago and broke down and bought a car 
&gt; trailer.....the latest problem is I have nothing that will pull the trailer 
&gt; cept my Camper or the wife's Bunny (that's if I agree to wait for hell to 
&gt; freeze over).  Looking for a Caddy Funeral Coach as a tow rig.   Anybody 
&gt; have a spare in the Pacific northwest???
