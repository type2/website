Ronnie writ:


all ATE and FAG (german) wheel cylinders come with bleeders

just my experiance
ps, checked stock and all my german had bleeders
all except 64-67 front imported didn't( mexico and brazil)
all other wheel cylinders had them
conclusion 64-67 bus front imported only,no bleeders
- - - - - - - 
yes, I have noticed rears come with bleeders, but front dont.

well, in the rear there is one cylinder, and it should have a bleeder on it.

In the front there are two cylinders per wheel (3/55-67) and only one has a 
bleeder, the last in line.   So I suppose they must be acquired separately, 
not supplied with as they would only be needed for half of the wheel 
cylinders.
