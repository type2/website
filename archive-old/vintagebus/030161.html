&gt; Hello all!
&gt;
&gt; If the rumored New Microbus looks anything like the renderings that
&gt; Hot VWs published a little after the New Beetle came out, you'll
&gt; find me down at the local dealer drooling on one.  It'll probably
&gt; be a bit beyond my means right now, though.  I still have to spend
&gt; some more money on the '64... :)

Don't get your hopes up.  Those were Steve Carrington?? FANTASY renderings.
Those were his dream ideas if he were designing the thing with NO regard to
current safety regulations or crash worthiness.  Much like our beloved splits
;-)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering...what do y'all think this New Microbus, if it comes out,
&gt; will do to the market for air-cooled Buses?

I don't want to think about it


&gt; I wasn't paying very
&gt; close attention but it seems that interest in and prices of real
&gt; Beetles went up when the New Beetle came out.

Yep.  Hopefully the coming recession will keep the already over inflated
prices in check.


Steve
