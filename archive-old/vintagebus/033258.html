I have located some solid bumpers w/overriders from a listy and he is too
far away from me to pick up convienently.  I have 2 good shape bumpers that
are longer on top that look sorta like \_______/!!! w/out overriders, but
made for overriders. I was hoping to just buy the overriders!  My bus is a
66 and I would like to know that the overriders will fit even if they are
from one of the rounder styles (67??) bumpers, if not I will buy the whole
thing.  Sorry for my ignorance.  These bumpers are located in GA, close to
TENN if anyone is coming up towards Annapolis Md from there I would gladly
pay you for your delivery services. Hopefully I will work on the bus this
weekend!  The style bumper I have now can be seen pretty well here!,

the over riders are the same -   59 through 67.  They are different front and
back, and the tubeses and guads for the back have rights and lefts.

the 59- 65s came with bumpers that were 'slash' - the edges went like the
curve of the wheel well, the 66 and 67s came with pointy ended bumpers.   

(  They are, however, just as functional and also physically interchangable,
this being a detail that may be important to some, but others dont notice.  in
fact, in the vw rags you see 'restored' buses with the wrong style and/or
mismatched bumpers- even deluxes with the wrong rear trim for the blade.    )
