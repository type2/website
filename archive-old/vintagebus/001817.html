I will be replacing the steering dampener on 67 bus tonight. Since this is
my only transportation at the moment I would like to get some new nuts and
bolts to replace the old before I start the job (don't wanna walk to the
FLAPS) Can anyone tell me what sizes I need so I can get them ahead of time?

Any caveats before I do this job?

Chris
