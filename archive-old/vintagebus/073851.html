Subject: Re: [VB] Fall OCTO

Have to admit to being a total lightweight regarding out of state shows.
 I've only been to one and that was because it was near where I was
going.  I've never driven my bus to an out of state show.  Young kids
are my excuse...lame I know.

OTOH, I did make it to Bad Camberg and drag my wife on a wild one day
trip up to Belgium so I'm not totally opposed to some adventure! 
Germany was great, I even got to indulge in my fast side in a 140 mph
turbo/diesel A4.

&gt; Yeah, I had planned to go, but family obligations kept me home.  But 2 out
&gt; of 3 OCTO's this year isn't bad. 8 out of state shows this year is my limit.
&gt; Plan to go to the Winter OCTO show but BBB8 will be the next. Bring/Save
&gt; some goodies for us out of towners.
