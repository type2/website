Thanks to the one person who gave me advice on spare parts for a long
trip. I could really use some help here. This is my first bus, I
bought it in March and got it running in late April. I have a little
over 1,000 miles behind the wheel at this point. But come August first
I am pointing this thing north and heading for Alaska. If all goes
well it will wind up being about an 8,000 mile round-trip, with a lot
of rough gravel roads at the northermost end. I've taken several such
long trips, but never in an air-cooled. I don't yet have a feel for
what is most likely to break down on me in a bus. And I've never been
to Alaska and could be wrong, but somehow I doubt I will be able to
find VW parts outside of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and it might even be
difficult there. So what do I bring to maximize my chances of an
automotively successful trip while minimizing the load on my bus and
wallet?
Spare Parts:
distributor cap, rotor, spark plugs, spark plug wires, points,
condenser, fan belt, accelerator cable, clutch cable, fuel line, fuel
filters, lots of gaskets, electrical wire, electrical connectors,
fuses, lamps, spare tire,...
Tools:
socket set, wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, vice-grips, hex keys,
files, breaker bar, torque wrench, hammer, pry bar, brake bleeder,
multimeter, timing gun, jumper cables, VW jack, flashlight, feeler
gauges, hacksaw, cold chisel, punch, metric tap set, crescent wrench,
tire pressure gauge, grease gun, tranny plug socket, fire
extinguisher,  30mm socket, 36mm socket,...
Emergency engine pull:
I guess I should make provision for this. Pair of scissors jacks and a
board? Does anybody have a more compact solution than that?
I bet there's a lot of other stuff I am not thinking of. Please fill
me in so I don't need to go bugging the AIRS types along the way. They
will appreciate it, and so will I,
Joel
