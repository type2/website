Subject: clutch problem

After getting the '61 panel back together and ready for a road test, I started the engine and couldn't shift into first gear! I hadn't done any maintenance to the clutch or pressure plate. The cable is adjusted right, the lever on the tranny moved but it was like the clutch wouldn't disengage. I tried putting the bus in gear and then cranked it. The starter pulled the bus forward. I pulled the engine back out and the throwout bearing, the shaft and forks it attaches to look good and the bushings are tight. My next step is to pull the pressure plate and look at the clutch disk. Anybody had this problem before?
