No matter what wild lobe you have, the lifter will always be on the heel of
the lobe with the valves in the position I stated. You adjust the intake
just as the exhaust starts to move, you adjust the exhaust just as the
intake closes. Lift, duration, ramp speed etc. are out of the picture. Ramp
speed and duration come into play AFTER the valve starts to open. The best
example to see lobe position in relation to lifter position is with an
overhead cam. It's all out in the open. Cam followers are the same as
lifters.



&gt; &gt; Turn engine in direction of rotation. When exhaust valve JUST starts to
&gt; &gt; open, adjust intake. Rotate engine, watch exhaust open then close, watch
&gt; &gt; intake open then close. JUST as the intake closes, adjust the exhaust.
&gt; &gt; Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. Takes longer to R + R valve covers
than
&gt; &gt; to adjust. Don't need to watch dist. rotor or timing mark.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Again, this method is perfectly acceptable IF and ONLY IF you are using
&gt; a stock camshaft. ANY of the hot- medium- or mild- grind cams with a
&gt; non-stock ramp to the lobes may very well be far from the lowest point
&gt; on the lobe ( which is where you want the valve play set from) if you
&gt; use this method, and you will end up with loose valves a clattering.
&gt; Loose valves not only cut down power, but as Stephen pointed out
&gt; earlier, a loose valve will not cool as well, because heat dissipation
&gt; onto the seat surface of the head will be lessened.
&gt; If you are going to try one of these methods on an angine you yourself
&gt; did not assemble, I would check all valve clearances the old-fashioned
&gt; one cyclinder-at-a-time method after you do it, the very first time. If
&gt; all is well, you most likely have a stock or close enough to stock cam
&gt; that you can go with this method.
