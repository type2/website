Subject: '61 Single Cab for Sale
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990609215144.007fa230_at_pop.aquila_dot_com&gt;

Here's what I got:
1 - 1961 single cab with broken engine, body is solid with mostly surface
rust (except for 1 hole in the bed 3/4&quot; x 1 1/2&quot;, Floor in cab is also
perforated at the corners) Gates are straight, left side rocker beneath
under bed cargo door is rotted out, otherwise it's sound mechanicaly.

I'm asking  $3500 for it 

The truck is located at my home about 40 miles west of chicago (for those
of you who consider such things as travel distance).
If any of you are interested or would like further info email me at:

ben.hawley_at_aquila_dot_com 

thanks 
Ben Hawley
