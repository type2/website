&gt;   bus content: drove my bus to the post office today, and to the bank.
&gt;  noticed the clutch needed adjustment again (new cable), but then i
&gt;  remembered something i wanted to pass along. when i replaced the cable, i
&gt;  noticed the metal tube the cable runs through had become broken from it's
&gt;  weld on the back, right where the bowden tube fits on. this is not the
&gt;  first bus i have had that this has happened to. maybe some of the past
&gt;  weird clutch adjustment problems could be attributed to this, since the
&gt;  tube moves slightly when the pedal is depressed. in the past, i have had
&gt;  the tube re-welded and the problem fixed, but this time i don't have access
&gt;  to a welder right now, so i'm just living with it. keep it in mind. i have
&gt;  only noticed this on earlier busses (pre 63).
&gt;  

get a large hose clamp- the size that does the inner edge of the axle boot is 
good- and calamp it to the rear torsion tube.  I did this to my 65 westy when 
I was in Arizona-  it broke loose I dunno why.  but it is clamped together 
now it fixed the clutch problem
