I had the same problem when assembling mine.  The problem will
 be how to secure whatever it is you end up using as a &quot;spacer&quot;

It took me several iterations to get it &quot;right&quot; and it still sucked
in at a couple spots.   It helps to use lots of something slippery,
ie dish soap, KY, whatever you have available.  It also helps to 
use a set of woodworking clamps to push the pieces together evenly.

Since you live in an artcic climate, you might consider soaking the
seals in hot water first.

&gt; sucked in the damn frame.
