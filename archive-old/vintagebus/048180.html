Yes pictures can be deceiving, I was told something totally different about


the 23 Deluxe, but the 53/54 panel was described pretty right on, Hell to


drive home over 2000 miles with 2 Barndoors regardless of their condition


made me feel all right, The 23 does have a lot of parts, it's totally


complete and have often do you see the fresh air scoop with AMBO fans? It's


a shame I have to cut it up but the last thing I need is another ornament in


my storage lot. I am going to cut the whole left side off and display the


logos and all. What will be available off of it is the roof clip, dash,
