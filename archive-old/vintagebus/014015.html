was writ:
&quot;My wife says I must sell these busses, she wants her driveway back.&quot;

two questions... what are the other buses and has this bus sat in the 
driveway for a LONG time without any work? i could see if it has been ther 
for years, but if you're working on it why does it have to go? my wife 
(fiance) asked me just yesterday if she was going to get to put her car in 
the garage this winter.... NOPE, wheres the bus gonna go;)
