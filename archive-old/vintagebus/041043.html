Subject: Bay full length  middle seat for sale, again

Well, I still have the full size middle seat that I advertised for sale last
week (long story).  I am asking $50 for just the seat.  Please e-mail me off
list at tainlay_at_home_dot_com or call me at 925 676-6661.  The seat is in
excellent condition with only 2 small tears.  It is very serviceable with
good padding.  Color is black, no headrests or even holes for them.  I also
have a complete set of hardware to mount the seat for $25.

Thanks,

Thomas
