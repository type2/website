Tampa Florida, 1967 microbus deluxe for sale. My name made it in Hot VW's 
magazine because I won first place in the florida bug jam in
Dade City last November. I have restored my baby and am done with it, that's 
why it is for sale.  I have 6,500 $$ invested into it with pictures from 
start to finish and all the paperwork from the original owner.  All I am 
asking is to break even, I love my bus and just want it to have a good 
respected home.  Asking price 6,500 $$   thanks for your time.  I love to 
talk about my bus so if you have any questions, just ask me.

thanks
Mark Pilarczyk
67 microbus splittie
