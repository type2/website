I've seen two types: one that takes a domelight-type bulb, for the license plate
light, and one that takes the same bulb as the later license plate lights.  I
have no idea which is which, but I generally see the domelight style on the 
earlier cars.  I think they're interchangable.

&gt; Wish that I could find one.  I did look at a good used one on VW Planet a
&gt; day or two ago.  It was $50 and looked like a deal but it was different from
&gt; mine.  My bulb holder has the license plate light holder rivited to it and
&gt; the socket/screw terminal looked different as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Were there different types?  My bus is euro spec, maybe that's the
&gt; difference?
