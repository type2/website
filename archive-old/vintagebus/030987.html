We are reading the back of the gold Bonami and it said &quot;DO NOT USE ON
WINDOWS OR MIRRORS&quot;
However we have been using it to clean the tempered glass window on our
fire place door, our heat for the winters in the high desert of southern
california, for three years probably ever day for three months a year No
scratching just did again to check and philip rubs hard



&gt; The word there was that there are two different kinds of Bon Ami; one in a
&gt; silver canister and another in a gold canister -- one safe for glass and
&gt; one not -- it was supposed to be clearly marked on the label.
