Hi,

To put a little science behind running the Cromoly pushrods at zero
gap, the expansion rate of chrome moly steel is about 1/2 that of
magnesium and about the same as the cast iron cylinders. As the engine
heats up, the case expands more  than the push rods and provides a
little lash. The aluminum push rods expand more than the cylinders,
and a little less than magnesium, so a little extra space is needed at
running temp.

&gt; &gt; fired her up.  It runs a little noisier with the chromoly pushrods
(Which
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; gapped at .004 across the board) as well.
&gt;
&gt; You should run your chromoly pushrods considerably tighter. I run a
'loose'
&gt; zero on mine. Meaning that I can spin them freely with my fingers,
but there
&gt; is no gap. For your trip you might let them out a tad in case the
valves
&gt; seat in a little, but tight is right on them. Just check them more
often.
&gt; Obviously if you hear the tell-tale popping of a tight valve, you
may have
&gt; to adjust them out for your particular engine, but I've never had
to.
&gt; Running them that loose will cause a lot of clacking and wear and a
loss in
&gt; power, but no benefit. For a little more power, you should lose the
double
&gt; valve springs. Under 6000 rpm's you don't need them and they flatten
your
&gt; cam faster.
