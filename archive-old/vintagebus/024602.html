Subject: Green Interior pieces...


    While playing in a junkyard today I found some previously
undiscovered treasures...

    in a multi-colored '64-'65 15W Deluxe were some panels and the rear
seat...

    inside nose kick panels are this really neat turquoise color, door
panels are same turquoise color w/ white or grey middle band and some
aluminum trim bits,  rear seat is same turquoise except the seating
surfaces are this neat-looking white or grey wide welt corduroy-looking
vinyl with an aluminum grab bar across the seat back (stands about 5&quot;-6&quot;
above top of seatback).

    I paid $30 for all the above + the submarine hatch roof section for
Micheal Heron...

    Would this set-up be the OE Como Green I need to do up my '63...

    colors actually looked much bluer than I expected...

    Local shop looked at the seat back (all I could fit in my car) and
said they can match both materials with little problem (about $350 for
all 4 seats, a couple hundred more if I want wall panels too)...
unfortunately the seat was good for color matching and frame only, I
pressed down on seat bottom and it seperated into hundreds of 1/8&quot;
strips of vinyl &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

        Thanks to all who teased me with info about Pomona Swap meet
yesterday..  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;  I have a cousin looking into it today...

            Take care...

                    JonR
