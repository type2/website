Subject: [VB] : Heavy pulley reviews needed. 

I have used quite a few of the RAGE weighted pulleys and consider them 
excellent and at 1/2 the price of a BERG even great. Yes they are made 
in Taiwan, as are SCAT, CB's, Bergs and many other crank, rod and 
rocker billet and blanks. I have had them all balanced (checked) and they 
are PERFECT, the groove is right on and the fit seemed good, tight, the 
way I like it(63,000 miles on my 1776 with one)
