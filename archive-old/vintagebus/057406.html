Subject: [VB] DC rear seats

Everett,

My 60 DC had a different rear base then the ones found
on the 61-65.  I belive that there are 4.  

1.  Binz
2.  59-60
3.  61-65
4.  66-67

The difference on my DC was the orientation of the two
upper rear mounts.  I do not remember which way they
were, but the were opposite to the 61-65 bases.  I
think mine were mounted so the wing nut was inside the
base while the later ones the wing nut was outside the
base.  I searched for over a year to find the right
one and ended up having to cut off my brackets and
reverse them to mount the seal correctly.

Just my 2 cents

Matthew

&gt;How many styles of Double Cab rear seats are there?
&gt;
&gt;I thought 3:
&gt;1. Binz
&gt;2. 59-65 - seat stand has a dip in it
&gt;3. 66-67 - flat seat stand
&gt;
&gt;But someone mentioned to me that they thought there
&gt;was a 59-early 60 
&gt;style
&gt;with &quot;bent pipes underneath&quot;.  I don't know what that
&gt;means.  My 
&gt;ex-Feb.
&gt;1960 Double Cab seat looked like normal rear seat to
&gt;me.
&gt;
&gt;Curious,
&gt;Everett
