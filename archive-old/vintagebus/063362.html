&gt;I'm trying to figure out what's wrong, if it's the gauge, or sender.

Here's how a Bus fuel gauge works.  It is wired internally like so:

+ terminal --- &quot;full&quot; coil --- sender connection --- &quot;empty&quot; coil --- ground

The coils are both little electromagnets.  One tries to pull the needle
towards &quot;full&quot; and the other tries to pull it towards &quot;empty&quot;.  I think
the &quot;empty&quot; coil is bigger than the &quot;full&quot; coil by design.

The sender works by having a variable resistance to ground.  When its
resistance is low, the &quot;empty&quot; coil is virtually shorted out, allowing
the &quot;full&quot; coil to get more juice and therefore pull the needle over
to &quot;1/1&quot;.  When its resistance is high, the coils split voltage almost
equally, so the (bigger) &quot;empty&quot; coil pulls the needle towards &quot;R&quot;.

The reason why it's done like this is to reduce the sensitivity to
battery voltage changes.  Since everything is done with ratios, it
doesn't matter what the absolute battery voltage is.  Later Bug
fuel gauges are single-coil and therefore have a little voltage
regulator to smooth out the battery voltage.

From your description, gauge #2 sounds like it's closer to working.
I don't know what the resistance spec is for a Bus fuel gauge sender
but VDO says a Beetle sender is 73 ohms empty and 10 ohms full.

Here's something you might try: unplug the wire that goes to the
tank sender, and use a jumper wire to hook the sender terminal
to the light bulb terminal.  This makes it read the resistance
of the light bulb which should be in the neighborhood of 8 to
10 ohms or so.  If Bus gauges work like Beetle ones, this should
show 1/1 or nearly so on the gauge.

Another thing you can try is to go to Radio Shack and buy a 271-1720
5K audio taper potentiometer.  Unplug the wire to the sender and
hook up a jumper from the gauge sender terminal to the middle lug
on the pot.  Ground one of the outside lugs on the pot and don't
connect anything to the other lug.  You should be able to make the
gauge read whatever you want by twirling the shaft of the pot.
Most of the adjustment will happen at one end of the pot's range,
and if you find that the gauge tends to go quickly from R to 1/1
over a very short rotation, move the pot ground to the other
outside lug and try it that way.

I hope this helps!
