&gt;What ever happened to the fine mesh screen filter in the fuel pump?
&gt;And hey, there is supposed to be another one in your gas tank over the
&gt;outlet!!

The one in the tank rusted away, and the one in the pump disinigrated. Sure 
we have clean gas, with ALCOHOL!



If it makes it through both screens it will likely make it
&gt;through your smallest carb jet too. It seems to me that the list
&gt;generaly agrees that &quot;the factory&quot; knew what it was doing. Do you
&gt;really need anything more? Gas in this country is normally pretty
&gt;clean stuff. Where are you all drivin? Mexico?

And how many years has that tank been in service collecting water and 
forming rust?
