Length is good, but so is width.  It's nice to be able to open the doors
once you get the beast inside.  There's an old story about a guy who
went out and bought the biggest cadillac, drove it proudly down his street,
all the neighbors gawking in awe.  Then he pulled it into the garage,
and couldn't open the door to get out!
