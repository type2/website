Hello List!  

Has anyone had any remarkable experiences with selling a VW on the internet?  
I've posted ads on some of the free VW classifieds but havn't had much luck.  
What else should I try?  Also, are there any good VW chats?  I havn't been 
able to find any that work or people use.  Thanks in advance,

Benj.
