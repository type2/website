Subject: Correct Glass on 57 Dlx?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

All the windows on the 57 are Sigla which is the same as what Greg has been 
searching for.  I have a rear window but it's a large logo SEKURIT that I got 
as a replacement.  So heres the question, what years are the the large logo 
for?  My friend has these on his 58 single cab.  Any chance on finding 
someone to trade it for a Sigla piece? 

Also, I noticed that the rear corner windows appear to  be different.  Both 
are Sigla but the logo on one is in the center top and the other is on the 
top in the right corner.  What gives?
