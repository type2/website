&gt;I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty with.

&quot;The semantics of 'best' are beyond anything.&quot; -- Muir

&gt;I Thought may be one of those fancy bored and stroked crate motors
&gt;you see in the VW magazines with the fancy Porsche fan. I am curious about
&gt;other options too.  I do have a little 2.8 liter GM v6in my back yard. I
&gt;have seen a bay window with a Toyota in it and I have seen a pic of a Subaru
&gt;engine in one. Any advice?

I think the 2.8 V6 might be too tall for a splitty engine compartment.
Something like an old Chrysler slant-6 would fit in height, but it would
be too long.  A Subaru flat-four would probably give you the least
fitment problems.  Another thing to remember is that all of these options
require running hoses and figuring out where to put the radiator.

This is just my opinion, but unless the Bus is already pretty cut up,
I'd say to go with a VW engine, maybe bored and stroked a little.
This gives you the least amount of hassle, more power, and makes it
easier for the next guy to put that NOS 1500 back in it.  Again, just
my opinion.
