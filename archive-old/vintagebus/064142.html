Subject: Repro taillights.

I got surprised a bit today when I went to check if all lights work correctly on my bus...
taillights were a bit messy.... passenger side very bright for parking light, not so bright for
brake or turn signal and driver side doesn't work at all. Thorough investigation revealed lack of
connection on the driver's side and mismatched wires on the other. Problem is I started taking
things apart and it all fell to pieces..... not too bad, I can always put it together but passenger
side lost so much metal to rust that there is no way I'll be able to save it....
WW has those repro taillights... are they good? I mean I'm not a &quot;Vintage nazi&quot; of any sort and this
would do just fine but I would like to get original equipment if possible. Anyone knows if there are
any available out there? I know it's a long shot.... it's been more than 40 years since the Bus left
the factory and I don't expect spare parts all over but it kind of seems that early Busses are
really pretty costly...I've seen these on eBarf once in a while - lots of money... I also needed
wiper arms.... as my Bus came from AZ where it doesn't rain. I'm slowly getting everything
together... see - I'm a freak about things working properly... if there is a light, it's suppose to
work... am I the only one?

enough of this ranting....
