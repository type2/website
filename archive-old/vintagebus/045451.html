&gt; Is a panel's cargo floor mat supposed to go all the way back to the
&gt; wheel wells and the engine bulkhead?  I got a WW repop, and it looks
&gt; kinda silly stopping at the cargo door.  It just looks too small.

Yes Thom, that's what size they came, silly looking or not.  Same size as the passenger model mats, just no holes for the seat bolts.

&gt; And there's this *hideous* seam down the middle, almost looks like
&gt; a &quot;tear on dotted line&quot; perforation.  For $90 I woulda expected better.

I think they made it in two pieces and glued them together, rather than in one piece like the originals, and yes you can tell it was made that way.  Then again in spite of it not being perfect, at least there is something out there.   And just try finding an original VW panel van cargo mat.  I have seen a couple.
