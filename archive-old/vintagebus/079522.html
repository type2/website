Subject: Re: [VB] Re: oil temp.

scoops actually lower engine compartment pressure.  very slightly. It seemed 
that the air found a way out of the engine compartment, the scoop just changed 
the air in there, keeping it cool.

they do, however, lower the engine compartment temp, which means the air 
cooling the heads are cooled by cooler air, which means the heads run cooler.  I 
should put my stuff about this online somewhere, never got around to it.

I thought engine compartment pressure would vary with road speed, engine 
revs, scoops or not, but the changes were extremely negligable.  engine 
compartment temp seemed a bigger factor on head temp.

oil temp changes were smaller and lagged well behind head temp changes.

Check your engine bay for vacuum using clear aquarium tubing and a glass of
water. Head off down the highway and see how much vacuum it's pulling.
Anything more than 1/8 to 3/16&quot; is too much IMHO. If you can get positive
pressure using scoops, you're going to be ahead of the game even more.
