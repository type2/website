&gt;It would be kewl to know what kind of buses and their conditions that we all
&gt;on the list have, so if you feel so inclined post what you got.

&gt;I have

Happy Friday (actually Sat AM!)

May as well chime in.  My wife will eventually find out about the 
size of the herd, and will demand action!  Telling her that I tried 
to sell one but couldn't find a buyer (because I deliberately set the 
price too high) isn't going to work again, either!  Two of the busses 
are at the shop, and three are stashed at other houses, so for the 
moment all is cool!

1) 67 21 Window - KATYBUS - right now this is the queen of my fleet. 
Needs a headliner, and a few deluxe parts, but otherwise is pretty 
nice.
2) 67 Crew cab - ANDYBUS - at the body shop since July for a two week 
job!  Entirely new mechanical, now a pretty straight body (had the 
correct rear window reinstalled.  The shop fabricated it from three 
pieces I found at the Classic.  Also installed a new bed that I 
retrieved from AZ.
3) 65 Kombi - rolled, parts bus - thanks to Jason Elm for help on this one
4) 66 Kombi shell  Just bought this one a couple of weeks ago.  It 
needs a bit of body work on the front right, but is otherwise pretty 
straight.  My plan is to remove all of the parts from #3 above, and 
install them on this one.  Some of the remaining body bits will be 
used to fix #5 below.  I will probably have some extra body parts 
from the 65 Kombi - let me know what you need.
5) 65 21 Window + most parts to fix, rust to the max.  Will tackle 
this when my welding skills improve.  Got a new roof for it from John 
Howard.
6) 68 DC - at the shop, now has new engine (1776 with dual kadrons), 
trans, brakes.  It is going to need some new panels on the floor, and 
some other body work.  Hope to get it back today!

Re-reading the above, I think the only possible solution is to just 
sell my business, and work on busses full time :)
