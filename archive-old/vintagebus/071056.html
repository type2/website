Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

Keep in mind, the galley going back to the case is small as well, which on a
freezing morning with 30wt oil is a huge restriction. The pump contributed to
the blown filter, because it couldn't get back to the case easily enough.

On a 30 degree day, pour 30 wt. oil into a cup. You will see the oil will
actually 'pile' it is so thick. This is why straight weight oils are a huge
'no no', especially in cold weather.  The 10w30 you just put in, is the same
thickness at full operating temperature as the 30wt. was, only it does not get
as thick when it gets colder. Some argue that multi weight oils will break
down, and go to a regular 10wt., which can happen, but not even close if the
oil is changed every 3000 miles. You have to drive on that oil for a LONG time
to break down like that.

Running a thick straight weight oil, especially when in cold weather, will
cause excessive wear until the engine is warmed up. This becomes even more of
a problem if said motor is not using a thermostatic setup to warm the engine
up quickly.

  I put a cheap Taiwan filter pump in the mystery motor that now resides in my
65 camper.   The oil pressure went UP dramatically, to the point where I now
used 10/30 wt oil after it blowing the springed bypass filter on a freezing
morning last winter with 30wt.
