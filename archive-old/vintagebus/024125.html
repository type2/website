Subject: *sob* *sob* we failed the safety inspection *sob*

Ok really no big deal - in fact in not sure that the mechanic that did
the inspection wasnt just trying to get more money from me by finding
repairs he thought i would ask him to do - well forget that - any
repairs i cant do ill take somewhere else - kinda seems like a conflict
of interest to me getting the safety inspector to do the repairs - here
in winnipeg the local newspaper had a story about sending cars around to
different shops to get safety inspected so one place they went to was a
chain called Canadian Tire (aka Crappy Tire) - so two of these places
found repairs that were clearly unnecessary - like obviously - it was
fraud - so the Crappy Tire said: 'we cant explain it, but it'll never
happen again,' then the next year the same two Crappy Tire stores did
exactly the same thing - there was like 11 different garages to which
these reporters went with thier cars - i am firmly convinced that most
mechanics are crooks (do i sound defensive about failing - haha)

got that out - now - some problems were kingpin adjustments and steering
adjustments and heater cables - ive searched the archives so....

how do i tell when my kingpins are adjusted correctly - ive a few books
- so i can figure out how to do the adjustments - but i just dont know
where they have to be to be correct - my bus, i think, is a 60

thanks in advance
