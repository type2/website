&gt; What's the allure of safari windows anyway?  You'd think that all the talk
of they leak, repros are crap, originals are too much $$$ would just turn
people off.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, I've never ridden in a Bus with them open so maybe I'm missing
something...
&gt;


Oh, come on. They are nifty. I ride with them open all summer in the
singlecab. You get that cool hundred-mile-an-hour-hairdo and when it is 115
out if you smile it will take the enamel off your teeth. Can be a little
scary sometimes. Once a truck in front of me threw up a big empty plastic
bag, must have been from like a 40 lb. sack of ice. Plastered me right in
the face. Watching it come at me through the open window was almost as bad
as when it hit me, I think I made a marble. Sprayed the cherry off of my
cigarette all over. Nasty. Get a few bees every now and then. Oh yeah, and
they leak, but only when it is raining.  8^)

Lets review:

Close the safaris when driving past the flower farms.
Always keep mouth shut.
Wear eye protection.
Avoid pigeons
Do not follow or attempt to pass a semi hauling livestock.
Don't leave your registration and insurance laying in the parcel tray. It
won't be there long.
