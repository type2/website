Okay, how do I explain this, hmmmm.  I know of no books, I went to college and
now make a pretty good living as a body tech.  So in other words I got to
practice on other peoples cars so I don't screw up mine!  Maybe this will
clear things up for you.  You know the up right flanges on the side of the
nose where the metal of the nose is crimped around the edge of the door
pillars?  These are Hemming flanges.  To cut off the old nose you what to cut
on the inside of the flange on the old bus nose, don't cut the pillar side.
You will also want to cut the lower flange, the horizontal one the same way,
about a 1/2 inch above the flange.  And for the top, below the windshields you
cut about 1/2 below where the nose meets the windshields.  This allows you to
pull your old banged up nose off and get it out of the way where you can then
see what your doing.  It's easier to uncrimp the flanges from two sides vs.
one side.  This will also allow you to grind the spot welds for the top of the
nose from underneath the windshield frames, thus you do not really disturb the
windshield frame metal.  Before you get ready to install the new nose, trail
fit it and then if things line up, you need to drill holes for spot welds in
the top of the nose where it slides in under the windshield frames.  The
general rule is 5/16 holes and then you take a bigger drill bit and bevel the
holes.  The bevels would be on the underside of the nose.  Spray the underside
of the windshield frames with weld thur primer, put some seam sealer in the
flanges and set the nose back on.  Hope you can learn to weld up side down
fairly quickly!  It really would be a good idea to practice your welding
before you attempt this.  Your bus gets a lot of structural support through
the nose.  As for crimping the flanges you need to slowly bend the flanges
around the pillar edges.  Once they are fairly close to being bent, you can
take a hammer and a dolly and bang on the flange to tighten them up.  I hope
this helps to clear things up...if you have anymore questions you know where
I'm at.
   As for the Mr. Bubble Head, sorry nothing to do with Mr. Bubble even though
I do enjoy a good soak as next as the next guy (takes a real man to admit
that).  I got this nick name from my old VW club in Va.  Back then I was on
Prodigy and use the same name and became sorta of a tech guru.  Which is fine
by me, back in the late 70's when I got in to VW's there were no computers.
Hell, we thought Pong was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  So I learned
pretty much everything by trial and error..lots of errors.  If I can help
anyone not make the same stupid mistakes I did...ohhh I screwed up big time
everynow and then (ask me about motor flush sometime) great!  I love working,
living, breathing, and talking VW's.

   Peace, Love, and
