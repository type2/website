Subject: Anyone want to swap seals?

I've got a rear cargo door seal for a bus, WCM brand new, Part# 211-193,
mounts on door, for buses 1950 to 1963 - I need to trade this for a new WCM
seal for a 1966 bus, WCM part# 211-193C

Any takers?  I'm hoping that someone mis-ordered and got stuck with a wrong
part or maybe some kind soul needs the seals and would be willing to order
the one I need and then we swap (of course I would make up for any price
difference if there was one.)

Thanks for the assistance...
