&gt; I do have a legitimate excuse in the form of two little ones and a wife
&gt; and...well you know the rest.   Even Ellis knows not to post on a Friday
&gt; NIGHT.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the last post is a really NEEDED question.   Does anyone still
&gt; carry/make/repop the asbestos (or similar substance) heat riser
&gt; insulators that go inside the tin pieces that surround the intake
&gt; manifold heat risers on a SP engine??  I've checked with 3 or 4 local
&gt; VWFLAPS in Southern CA and no one even know what I'm talking about.  One
&gt; guy said the dealer had them, but that was 7 months ago.    What about a
&gt; good substitute that people use if you can't buy the right things??

I don't know.  I made a set out of fiberfrax and red silicone that lasted
quite a while.  I've never actually seen a complete stock set on an
engine, just the remains.
