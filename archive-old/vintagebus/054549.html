Subject: Re: [VB] I got a hump!

Jamie,

Is you '60 a late '60?  Hump back front benches came in '61/'62 busses.  The
seat bottom will have two curved tubes sticking up from the back at each end.
They are extensions of the frame rail.  To verify that this seat came with
your bus, take a look at the seat brackets.  Are they 3 position brackets??
All hump seat busses had these two year only brackets.  Don't know why you'd
want to get any closer to the wheel than you already are when the seat is
fully back.  Possibly its the M code option for midgets ;-)

I should know.  A PO of my '62 put in '63 1/3 rd 2/3 rd seat.  Thinking
original must be better, I searched for the correct seat and brackets.  Found
them.....installed them...and jumped in expecting better leg room and more
driver comfort.   What did I get?   2 inches LESS leg room and a bit more
upright driving stance.  So much for progress!   It is original though, I keep
telling myself ;-)

I've never seen a '60 with this seat/bracket combo, but your bus could be a
really late model 60.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I have been lurking a lot lately, enjoying the wealth of info this list
&gt; brings. In August, I obtained a '60 DD Panel.  Over the past two months, I
&gt; have been tinkering, admiring, and dreaming ;0) I noticed for the fist time
&gt; tonight the odd front bench.  It has a hump in the back rest.  I don't
&gt; think this is the correct seat because the base is not as wide as  I think
&gt; it should be.  Any ideas as to what it came out of?  Thanks
