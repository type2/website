my pops use to let me drive his 98 ch_at_&amp;y 4 door long bed dually when i was 
first beginning to drive.  That was quite a sight when i pulled into the 
McD's drivethru (i didnt get any boogers) and got stuck :)

I ended up totalling the truck a few years ago.  t-boned an s10 doing 55.  It 
hurt. My bus us better anyways.
