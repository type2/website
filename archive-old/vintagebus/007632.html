Isaiah - I know what it's like to to want to have a dub and work on it but
not have a place to keep it.  I have had nothing but incessant trouble with
my tattle tale neighbors and the city over my dubs.  I've found a guy who
lets me store stuff on his property for $5 a month.  I usually pay him
several months at a time and I always keep diligent track of what I owe him.
Richard Alexander is right about renting space from a farmer - they love
having the money and even though it's money our of your pocket (my biggest
beef), you can, with persistance, find a place to store them.  Currently,
the city has a code that allows for an enclosure which minimally can be
stockade fence panels placed around the vehicle itself.  This is how my bus
is being stored in the backyard and my yard isn't any too big either.  If
the thought of paying rent doesn't appeal to you, and your city
codes/neighbors won't allow you to store the vehicle on your own property,
then I guess the noble thing to do is to offer the bus to someone on the
list.  I know what it's like going through hell over a vehicle as far a
having no money, no time, and no cooperation from others who don't realize
their persistant calls to the police only prolong the 'eyesore.'  As bad as
it sounds, I can't wait until the ambulance shows up with a one way ticket
at this old fart's house across the street from me (he's the tattle tale
drunk guy who causes most of my problems.)  I'm actually enjoying watching
the ambulance show up around the neighborhood, carting off these old
retirement coots who cause me so much grief.  Since we moved here 3 years
ago, 3 of the 4 ambulance trips have resulted in one way tickets.  One of
these days when the phone calls to the police stop, I'll know who it was
doing the calling - it's only a matter of time.  The best part is that I
make friends with the new arrivals and don't have trouble with them
afterwards.

Dimented as it sounds, time is my ultimate weapon when dealing with these
trouble makers.  Basically, I've already won. :-)

Anyway, back on topic Isaiah - keep us posted on what you do.  Do your
research - you've got 3 months to play with - use it wisely and scope
around - stay away from storage units - much too high.  Stop by farmhouses
that have lots of vehicles along a fence line and see if they will rent you
space.  You'd be surprised.  Agree on a price, pay in advance, and give them
a plate of cookies that you made yourself to show appreciation.   Then pack
your bus full of mice repellant and poison because they sure love new
arrivals.  I found that out...
