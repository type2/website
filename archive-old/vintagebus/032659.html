they made flipseats in '66? i have never seen one that late, nor heard of
one. 


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt; And now comes the weekend's highlight (for me): I checked out a
one-owner '66
&gt; &gt; Westie that I had been after for some time. It was very complete
(walk-through
&gt; &gt; bench, child's cot, tent, roof rack), and original (velvet green paint,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;''walk-through bench'' ?? How can that be? Please explain.
&gt; 
&gt; Flip seat westies were built on walk throughs.
