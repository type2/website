During the Classic weekend I found and purchased a wrecked 66 Westy (a
24'ROUND TREE LIMB FELL ON THE ROOF), this bus was in the mountains of
Cali., in my search for the location, going up and down all the windy
mountain roads my brakes got so hot they began to fail, I had to pull over
and let them cool down, then continued my search going down the windy steep
mountain roads in FIRST gear letting the engine do the braking, in SECOND
the momentum would over power the engine, a very scary dilemma, and the bus
I bought was driven daily in and out of these mountains.

best)

ps.  after 34,000 plus miles on my brakes I pulled all the drums to check
them, In my guesstimation there was less then 20 per-cent wear on the shoes,
good for another 40,000 easily. Turn those drums when doing brakes.

Until, of course, said brakes overheat and lose all stopping power.  I
had this happen during some night time &quot;try to find the campsite&quot;
mountain driving.  It was really quite disturbing.  So, the real
answer is &quot;it depends on what your local road conditions are&quot;.

Btw, it's illegal in at least some mountainous states to have the
vehicle in neutral while moving, particularly and specifically on
downgrades (I guess they figure no one'll be wanting to do that while
going uphill).  You can use the clutch, though.  I believe this is in
response to runaway trucks whose brakes have overheated (i.e., the
scenario I was in above, except my bus didn't *quite* run away).
