Subject: oil change ?

I went to do the oil change thing on my 58' espresso bus and noticed something
a bit odd.  The engine is a type 1 that I believe is a '74.  There is no drain
plug.  The plate on the bottom of the case is solid, no place for a drain
plug.  Any ideas?  Am I missing something here?  I do not see an aftermarket
oil filter or anything out of the ordinary.  Anyone, anyone...
