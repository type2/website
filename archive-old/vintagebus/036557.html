Message-ID: &lt;82d5lu$97dk_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

got my samples today of the bus upolstery that TMI
is reproducing, i got platinum and como green samples
look pretty damn good to me, but i am no expert,
will go out on sunday and compare to the original fabric in my
66 deluxe to see how they match!  will be available for sale
in 10 days from this post (that what i was told) price still pending,
am haveing covers and door panels made for my 66 walkthrough deluxe,
these are the first production pieces, so we will see how they turn out.
will have the bus at BBB IV for you all to look at and voice your
opinons.
will post pictures of the fabric in a day or so, 


ps, damn fast downlosads now, just got ISP cable, holy sh#t batman
is it fast or what, if you don't have it get it, it's like a new
computer now!


FIRE update: the insurance company decided it's best to totaly redo the
whole
shop, so the showroom, offices, and the rest of the building are going
to be
totally demoed and redone, will still be open for business, but a bit
slower
as we have to work around the construction, so thanks for all your
patience
and please all come by during BBB IV for my re grand opening blast,
don't know
what we'll do yet, but i'm sure it'll be good,

watch for new web site and new products soon
working on these asap.

thanks  ronnie    www.type2parts_dot_com
