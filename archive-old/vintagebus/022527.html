I have a 1&quot; 36mm and 1&quot; 46mm, along with the 1&quot; breaker.  I use a step-down
adapter to fit it into my 550 ft/lb Ingersoll Rand impact wrench, which I
never really need, because we all know that real men remove axle nuts with
their teeth.

&gt;&gt; I picked up a 1 inch drive breaker bar for $15.  Now the problem is
&gt;finding
&gt;&gt; 1 inch drive sockets.  I founf a place that special order A 36mm
&gt;socket but
&gt;&gt; it would set me back $29.  I will just sit back and wait for another
&gt;good
&gt;&gt; deal on sockets comes around.
&gt;
&gt;1 inch!!  You could twist the end of the axle off with that sucker!
&gt;
&gt;You are now the champion of the &quot;Manly-Man socket wrench competition&quot;.
&gt; Us folk with mere 3/4 inch equipment bow down to you!  :)
