With all due respect, I don't see how that would last very
long, unless you used a LOT of strong goop! 

I don't like silicone sealants myself; I prefer the aviation stuff - seems
to stick better, but that's just me.

&gt; reduction box from the swing plate.  Use a spray can of brake clean to 
&gt; degrease both parts.  Then you can use high temp silicon sealant on the plug 
&gt; seam, and when you quickly bolt the two parts together you end up sandwiching 
&gt; the sealant in place.  Eric&amp;Barb
