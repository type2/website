My whole Outlook Express email program turned into vaporware. All my
messages are gone, so I can't answer them by pmail.

Thom, you were wanting a 68-only arm? I have a pair.
Yes 68 is different. The pivots are smooth shafts. 69 and up have a tapered
spline with a nut to hold the arm on. 68 have a set screw like 67 and back.
