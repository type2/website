Subject: Re: [VB]gas pedal pad
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

How does the pre-67 gas pedal differ from the
68+? I know the latter ones had a nice rubber pad
that covered the pedal, may work for the older
ones, it had deep groves in it. Just a thought.

&gt; Seriously though, I've never, personally, seen
&gt; or heard of a pedal pad for
&gt; the gas in a bus.  Doesn't mean they don't
&gt; exist, I'll admit the white coats
&gt; don't let me out too much...I'd be pleasantly
&gt; surprised if they are around
&gt; :-)  Pedal pads, not guys with nets.  The way
&gt; accessories are for these
&gt; things, I'll bet there's at least an
&gt; aftermarket one kicking around
&gt; somewhere.  I think that'd be pretty neat!
