Hey y'all
No, this isn't a question, it's an invite.  If you don't feel like joining 
the Peach State Transporters up in the mountains (where it gets dark, 
spooky, and COLD), joining the Full Moon Bus Club at Edisto Island 21-23 
January starts sounding like a great alternative!  Great shell collecting, 
beach walks, great company (what Full Moon Campout doesn't have that?), and 
the ONLY place in the works where you can have our Internationally Famous 
Breakfast Burritos (folks from Canada have had them!)!  I could go on and on 
but instead I offer this link if you're inclined to join us -

Enjoy and hope to seeya there!

Mad Uncle Dave
