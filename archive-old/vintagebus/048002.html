There should be a tube that runs parallel to the rear seat, attached at a T 
to the tube coming out of the floor/ engine hump intersection.    The 
horizontal tube has slits in it for the heat to blow out of.    If you just 
have an open tube, some DPO has hacked it off.     It is a welded on part of 
the bus.  (or should be)

Perfect!


I need the heat tube for under ther rearmost bench
seat. The one that goes from left to right, it fits
onto the heat pipe which comes through the tranny hump
(or whatever you call that part of the rear cargo
floor which turns upwards to eventually become the
luggage area)

Anyway, my bus has the tube coming out of the
firewalll area and that's it. How does the sideways
(underseat) tube fit on that? And does anyone have
one?
