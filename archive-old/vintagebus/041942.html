&gt; Guys, from what OG two tone buses I've seen the factory norm was from
&gt; Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
&gt; the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
&gt; beltline. 59 and on the top color whether it be grey-biege, cumulus
&gt; white or whatever was painted over the entire bus and the bottom color
&gt; was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the beltline down.
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence can be seen when the OG paint fades and shows the base color
&gt; through i.e. the 20K SWR G-B 23 window at OCTO in June, you could see
&gt; spots of grey-beige coming through the sealing wax red. Then look at a
&gt; number of faded deluxes and standards and such from the 50's and you'll
&gt; always see the bottom color coming through the top color.
&gt; 

I know we've discussed this before and seem to recall that there were
examples that questioned this. Is it possible that the color that was
sprayed first on the entire bus was the interior color and that the top or
bottom 2nd color was done after?
