Subject: [VB] Regulator repair or speaker repair and philosophy, part 2, flames away!
Message-ID: &lt;382233BB.B6AB7C72_at_evestamail_dot_com&gt;

Hello F&amp;KLM,

Well I did it, after weeks of running on battery only, I screwed my
courage up, pulled my 12v regulator and yanked off the cover to have a
look see at those &quot;no  user serviceable parts&quot;.
On the lower set of parts the middle contact had melted off and jammed
itself in the gap shorting across and giving me the old red light blues.
With a screwdriver, I tweaked the contact out and set it back in its
hole. After that, I put a steel ruler in the gap and soldered that
bugger back in. I filed the points and closed the cover and installed
the regulator back on the Kombi.
So far so good. Seams to work. The light goes out just off of idle now.
Do you all think that my solder will melt before I get enough lose
change to throw a new one in it? I was also wondering if the middle
contact was double sided before it got burned? Anyone else done this?

Aloha

ken
