Subject: Re: [VB] Question about steering dampners?

Right, no dampners on Barndoors, mine seems to drive fine, no grabbing or
anything, maybe I never noticed.

There's a guy in Phoenix with what he says is a Barndoor steering dampner,
he's had it at shows for years, I always forget my parts book to check it
out because it doesn't look like the one I've seen pictured somewhere as a
retrofit.  It was even at a show that Clara was at, she missed it, uh-oh.
:)

I'll snap it up someday, the guy is a little crazy, one of those guys that
some parts are dirt cheap and some are insane, everything is random, maybe
it'll be $5 next time instead of $50 or whatever I didn't want to spend.
