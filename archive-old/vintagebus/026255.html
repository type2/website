Volks,

I am looking for this item for another VW fan.  He is rebuilding a Bobcat
skid loader and the original Milwaukee (aircooled!) engine is not
repairable.  Since there is ample space in the engine compartment, he has
decided to replace this with a 1600cc dual port VW engine.  The project is
almost complete, with a steel plate adapter that mates the VW engine to the
Bobcat transmission and a very short universal joint.  I hope to get
pictures posted when it is complete.

At any rate, he is concerned that at high revs the cooling will be a
problem, and mentioned that a speed governor like the kind found on early
busses would help.  Does anyone have one of these that is not being used?

Thanks,
Doug Lloyd
