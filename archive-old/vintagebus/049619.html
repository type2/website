Subject: 67 Deluxe project for sale or trade - Austin TX

Well, common sense has prevailed (I already have 2 busses and an old Ch*vy
1/2 ton that all require tinkering/time/money), so I am gonna see if any of
you folk want to rescue a decent project bus.
Pics are at :
http://www.eden_dot_com/~soundex/vw/bus/newbus.html

The description on that page makes things sound worse than they are; haveta
change that :)

The short: 67 Deluxe, $500 OBO to a Listee; will consider trading for parts
I need/want.
The long:  no sunroof/skylights, bashed nose, bashed driverside front door
pillar, cut rear wheel wells. Hole in spare tire well for aftermarket
StewartWarner heater (not there). No middle seat, no rear seat back. UGLY
paint. Nasty windshield middle pillar rust, popouts need to be cleaned
up/repainted. No motor, unknown tranny.
Has UNCUT dash, original front seats, original front floor mat and pedestal
mats in decent shape; no cargo or rear mat. All popout latches complete and
working. All glass save windshields. No gauges. Battery tray 'replaced.'
Have the title. Missing cargo latches.

The best part - except for where the accident has damaged it, rust has not
been much of a visitor to this bus. The front floor is rotted in spots due,
I'm sure, to leaky window seals. Dash tray is fine, tho.  Some rust behind
driver's pedestal, where the bulkhead joins the floor, and some perforation
around the passenger side middle seat mount. But BOTH rockers and 90% of
the underside are rust free. 3 of 4 jackpoints are PRISTINE. I'm not
kidding, the underside of this sucker is about as good as any bus I've ever
seen in Texas.
Had I the time/cash, I would love to restore this bus, but I have neither.
Please help give it a good home, as here it will simply continue to rot
away.

Further questions or requests for more pics, pmail away.
