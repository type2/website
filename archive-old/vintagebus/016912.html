&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I met a nice couple from my old hometown the other day while at a 
&gt; lake
&gt; enjoying the sunset with the 62.  They told me about how they just
&gt; bought a nice 70 bus from AZ for their daughter, and are having 
&gt; problems
&gt; with it.  The motor is a very recent MoFoCo rebuild (thats the 
&gt; problem
&gt; right there) and they have it at a shop right now...but the guy 
&gt; isn't
&gt; doing anything (its been sitting for 7 weeks untouched) so they 
&gt; asked me
&gt; if I'd like to do some work on it...I accepted.
&gt; The motor runs pretty smooth at idle...I haven't driven it or
&gt; anything...but when it starts up...all is normal...but after a 
&gt; minute or
&gt; so...it starts smoking really bad.  I'm thinking piston rings...but 
&gt; I
&gt; could be wrong.  Why would this be happening??  Oil can get in and 
&gt; burn
&gt; through a few places.... worn valve guides, and worn piston
&gt; rings...correct?  this is a recent rebuild...and he said he was 
&gt; driving
&gt; along at 50mph and all the sudden power just dropped and he could 
&gt; only
&gt; do 35 or so...and it started smoking real bad.  It only does about 
&gt; 35mph
&gt; max now.  I'm thinking he burnt a hole in the piston? 

Hi Isaiah,

Run a compression check
That will tell you if you have one...(said hole in piston)

If the MoFoCo engines are as bad as you say, maybe the ring gaps are 
lined up all in a row during assembly rather than spaced 1/3 of the
circumference apart from each other and he engine is pumping oil into the
cylinder...

If the valve clearances are set loose this oil pump up will occur and
foul the plug and spit oil into the exhaust.

The engine will not smoke until the heat from the other cylinders
increase temps to flash point.

If all four cyl  are good with in 10% of each other on compression check,
pull spark plug wires individually with an insulated set of grips and
notice any RPM drop at idle. No rpm drop indicates a non functioning
cylinder.

Because it's not your engine don't trust plug readings as they may give a
false history 

aloha
Ken
