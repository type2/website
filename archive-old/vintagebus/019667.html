&gt; I know what to do electrically but does anyone have a suggestion for a

In the Kombi I had mine mounted in the driver's side &quot;battery tray&quot;.  This 
worked well for me, it's nice and out of the way.  I drove it in all kinds of
weather and never had any trouble with water getting in the box.  The Westy
has a BN4 exhaust pipe there, so I'm thinking of mounting the box on the strut
on that side.  It's a bit more &quot;in the way&quot; there, but not too bad.  If you're
worried about water that would also be a good place to put it.

&gt; Also what have you done with the 12v which now needs to go to
&gt; tiger,pertronix+,cutoff,choke and brakelites. Im thinking terminal block
&gt; because splicing 5 wires just doesnt sound that appealing to me.

I have always done the splice :-) but I want to do something cleaner this time
around.  Please let the list know what you work out!
