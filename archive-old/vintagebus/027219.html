Subject: Swivel seat F/S

Glad to have &quot;the list&quot; back up.........................Thanks to
all that made it possible

Onto business.....I have in my possession an NOS swivel seat
(grey with white piping). With all the talk recently of walkthrus
I thought I would offer it up here first before putting it on
eBay. Not only for a walkthru, it'll work in any Bus with a 40/60
split front seat as well. Although I'm not sure why you'd need
it.

Anyway if anyone's interested contact me privately.

Greg
