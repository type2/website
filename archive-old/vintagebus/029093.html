Subject: Update

However crude (i'm no programmer and my guy has been busy) I've
re-arranged some stuff. I have some new pics in the gallery section.
Some friends ran across a vandalised Bay window. Don't know what
happened to the owner, but looked recent. This was in the Aussie
outback. Apparently the owner was some type of German mechanic judging
by the overalls and tech manuals found near and in the bus.
