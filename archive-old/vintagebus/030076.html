Subject: That splitty doublecab in Recovery, GA (long)
References: &lt;87001A704DFAD211B24FAA0004000238269308_at_talnt1.corp.ene_dot_com&gt;

On a back road not far from my parents' place on Lake Seminole there's a
doublecab splitty bus sitting a few hundred yards off in a field.  Been
in the same spot for 2, 3, maybe 4 years.  Maybe more.  Every time I'm
approaching my folks' place for a visit, I check to see that it's still
there and tell myself next time, when I have time, I'll take a look.

Doesn't look like much from the road.  Obvious that the doors are off. 
Rust colored.

Not like I couldn't just call the guy.  I know whose property it's on;
the owner sold my brother a nice '60 Ghia convertible that I ended up
with, and he was the main contractor for my parents' house.  But you
know how it is: if I called him and he said &quot;not for sale&quot; over the
phone, I wouldn't get a chance to see it.  Sometimes the tactile part is
worth the whole trip.

Well, finally last Saturday I was up at the place helping out (my
parents run a small Christmas tree business) and things were slow enough
that I finally decided to cruise over and see what I could learn.  A
friend and fellow bus lover who was up visiting for the day jumped in my
'71 Westy with me and we headed down the road.

I've spoken elsewhere of this part of the world that many people call
Recovery Ridge (e.g.,
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/fiction/recovery.html) so I won't go
into much detail.  Non-locals, just employ your usual myopic, provincial
stereotype of the South and let it go at that -- no need challengin'
your brain.  Suffice it to say that as we pulled up into the driveway
with my red bus all decked out in Christmas-parade-leftover regalia I
was feeling a bit city-slickerish.

We were directed across the road to a couple of quonset huts and old
barns in the woods, surrounded by active pickup trucks and dormant '40's
packardesque mushrooms sprouting from the damp undergrowth.  One of the
barns, looking ready to collapse, held a Willys jeep and the strangest
looking speedboat I've ever seen this side of the Batboat.  Nearby was a
low-decked Greenbriar single cab.  Another barn held a great looking '64
Corvair sedan.

But I wasn't looking for Corvairs or Packards or Batboats.  After a bit
of hunting and waiting -- during which we were treated to the
test-running of an old grist-mill and the indescribable aroma of
fresh-ground corn meal -- we located the owner and he was amenable to us
having a look at the double-cab.

&quot;You go back acrost the road, up past the tractor barn by the house, and
folla that road past the old cemetery and you'll see it.&quot;

He added that the engine was in pretty good shape and just lacked
something-or-other.  I was surprised, since this seemed to imply it was
not the empty husk it appeared to be from the main road.  (Why didn't I
ever think of binoculars?)

So with mounting but tentative excitement Mark and I clambered in the
bus and headed to the spot.  On the way we passed the cemetery in a
small grove of trees, surrounded by a fence and containing some very
nice looking stones of considerable vintage.  Used to be a church near
here.  Nothing but the warm strong moist wind of an approaching Alberta
Clipper, shaking the oaks.  Forlorn?  Well, maybe so.  Ask me in a
hundred years, see if I prefer the Well-Manicured Memory Gardens to a
decrepit graveyard on a hill in far southwest Georgia, surrounded by
junk cars.

For surrounded it was.  On the way in we passed a homemade dune buggy
with a 36-horse engine.  No other VWs.  The double-cab was just around a
corner.

Suspense over, folks.  This car is _stripped_.  Side gates, all rusty
and bent but possibly restorable, are about all that's left of any
value.  Sometime long before it was parked, this truck became a farm
beater: someone removed the doors and even cut the sidewalls off the
crew cab section.  The nose below the windshields is plywood.  No
metal.  Might be a handful of sections saveable with a sawzall, but
nothing else.  Big taillights, so it's a 62-up.

The wind blew; scudding grey clouds hurrying north to send Gulf water
snowing down on the mid-Atlantic.  Tornado warnings to the west. 
Tomorrow the temperature would drop like a stone.  

I smiled.  Thank God.  Last thing I need is another project.  We left it
to its peaceful repose.  At least I know now.

But I wonder what he wants for that 36 on the dune buggy?

Joe
