Subject: value? Blaupunkt am/fm
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a friend with a am/fm Blaupunkt radio that we believe has been in his 
bus (61 camper) from the beginning. This is the one with a speaker connected 
to the bottom of the radio. The question is, what is it worth? He is parting 
out the bus (I don't think I've ever seen one rustier) and I want to buy the 
radio. Neither of us know what it's worth and I want to be fair to him as 
well as get a deal for myself. Is $100 decent?
Thanks,
Brian
