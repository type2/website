It's not that bad to have an unusual bus. It's fun because you learn
something new every day. M-codes plate was taken for a resto I assume.
Someone did some work on this bus before and I'd say some extensive work.
It looks like a previous resto. Limited rust, paint in a cab that is not
original. It's hard to say anything buy the taillights. There are wires
that were cut, spliced and some dangling freely all over the place. There
are a few switches that I don't even know if they are controlling
anything. I guess time will show. Thanks for reply.

&gt;If your bus was an euro spec it would have amber rear turn signals in 
&gt;the
&gt;rear,this would mean three power wires to the rear lamp housings.Look 
&gt;at the
&gt;spot the plate was mounted I was able on one of mine to read the codes 
&gt;and
&gt;numbers that had transferred to the bulkhead by rust and paint transfer 
&gt;from
&gt;the M-Code plate,look at angles with a good light.
