This reminds me of a VW show I went to in Belgium a few years back.  The
entire town (forgot name) closed down for this event.  The dealership looked
like a new dealership in the front but there was this porthole through time.
Actually it was a hallway with fencing that went from the floor up and over
to the floor on the other side to form an archway.  On the other side of
this fencing , on both sides, was vintage NOS parts from years gone by.  My
buddy and I stood there with our fingers clamped on the fencing for what
seemed like hours just staring and drooling.  It was the most beautiful
thing I had ever seen.  We are talking steering wheels, semaphores, wheels,
radios, various engine pieces parts... you get the picture.  At the end of
this &quot;porthole&quot; was a sort of museum with several cars that ranged from an
old ambulance complete with manikins for realism to a Hebmuler to a split
window.  There were other cars there too but I can't remember what they
were.  In all it was an awesome place.  Because we were very short on time I
didn't get a chance to find someone to ask if the parts were for sale.  By
the way the parts were displayed they almost seemed like they were part of
the collection.  I know I took some pictures there so I will hunt them down
and post them for y'all.

It would also be nice to see if they still have air-cooled vintage NOS parts
stashed away. Just my 2 cents.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I wonder if there is a record of all the VW dealers in the states and
when
&gt;  they were active?  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; With each and every VW you got a dealer listing booklet!  Check your swap
&gt; meets and literature dealers.
