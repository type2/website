Subject: RE: [VB] frozen sliders

Yeah I have a gas heater; unfortunately my summer went by without
installation, I need to make some sort of cable up to the front for
control..

 

I have a way to heat and melt them I guess, the issue is that it happens
every time it gets wet, maybe the lithium grease might help?

what about going through the drive thru???   You gotta open the sliding
window for that.   I think the dryer I dea is good. 

 

  I had had this problem once or twice, but it doesn't usually happen and if
its that cold I don't open the windows much.   

 

Get a gas heater.   Then it'll be 70* in the bus with snow on the ground
outside.
