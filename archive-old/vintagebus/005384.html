Hi All,
I saw this ad in the Nickel trader.
&quot; 1955 1 wheel utility trailer, all aluminum,
cover, cool for classic hotrods,
$200. 530-244-7498 or 530-275-6745&quot;

Much cooler behind a split window bus.
If I had the room it would be in mine... :(
He's got it set up to use with a hitch.
Sounds pretty nice but I haven't seen it.
Located just north of
Redding, CA. Still for sale as of 7/22.
Larry
