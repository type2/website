Subject: Re: [VB] dangerous without bulkhead?

I imagine they used the same setup as my 67 walkthru:

The seatback plates attach to the body at the sides and bottoms - that
stiffens the sides up, and the spare is in the left rear corner in a 8&quot;
deep pocket that dips down into the engine room, far left side.

&gt; i realise they did make a walkthrough at the time, but did these have extra

&gt; where did they keep the spare?
