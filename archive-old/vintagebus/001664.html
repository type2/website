Now Nikki, to quote a person on this list...

&quot;If you can't something nice about someone, keep your mouth shut.&quot; or
something like that...

Dawn or Thom, how does this not apply equally?  What matters is that Thom
has been told not to show up based on opinions he has.  That just sucks.
There is at least one bus Thom has cut up that would be a nice candidate for
restoration over here on the left coast of the US.  Does that put him in the
same category as the Holes?  Maybe, maybe not.  But to be told you can't
attend a show because you express opinions?  Different opinions are what
makes this list so great!
