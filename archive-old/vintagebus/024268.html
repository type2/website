Subject: New Phobia

I'll admit it....I occassionaly pass people.  Not often, but once in a
while someone is
driving abnormally slow and I will be forced to pass.  Other times, with
a good tailwind
on a downhill I pass people even when they are clipping along at the
speedlimit.

However, this activity comes with a price.

Immediately after passing the other vehicle, I get a panic attack that
my bus might
break down at this exact moment requiring me to pull over and having the
car I just passed
race by with the driver thinking &quot;took everything he had to pass me, ha
ha ha&quot;.

This is one of those &quot;hidden, untalked about&quot; afflictions and I feel so
alone.

...Markus

ps:  Tardis has never broken down yet, which is what makes this so
unbearable.
