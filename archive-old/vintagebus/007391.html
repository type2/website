The copy of Split Screen Scene has to be the best for a good while. Just
made me wish BC was on during a reasonable time i.e. MY HOLIDAYS!
Anyway, the van looks good Damon but please, not another mango green/seagull
grey van!  I think it must've been the most popular colour for Brit Splits
and I get a sense of deja vu at shows. I've been thinking that the colours
of the Porsche Le Mans cars would look good on a split (in other words, that
orange and turqouise combo - maybe I've been working too hard though)
Imagine it lowered on Porsche wheels - ???

Regarding the article I've just got two questions, where are those
pseudo-fusches from and what's George's phone number!

Martin
'55 Devon (chestnut brown/sealing wax red!)
'65 Beetle
'83 Golf Gti
