Subject: [VB] dizzy?


&gt; I've got alot  of stuff to say so I'll aplogise in advance. I've got a 69
bus
&gt; and have only had it a few months now and decided to swap the 009 dizzy
for a
&gt; stock vac adv one (205T). Anyway once I had removed the 009 and went to
install
&gt; the 205T I realised with the help of my local flaps that the PO had
modified
&gt; the dizzy clamp so the 009 would slide farther down in the engine to mate
up
&gt; with the drive gear. This is an AK engine and I've read in the Bentley
manual
&gt; the some of these engines took a 3mm shim (113 105 235B) in addition to
the
&gt; normal 2 under the dizzy drive gear and came to the conclusion that this
3mm
&gt; shim was missing. I tried to use 4 of the regular shims and had no luck.
My
&gt; question is has anybody come across this before and if so where can I (A.
get
&gt; this elusive 3mm shim or (B. use something else to boost the height of the
&gt; dizzy drive gear just enough to mate up? You help is much appreciated.

If you can't locate or fabricate a 3mm shim,
make an accurate measurement from the case
to the top of the dizzy drive gear shaft, compare to the
dizzy, and add appropriate additional shims to the stack
such that you have at least 2mm ( or more ) of engagement.
Clean the shims and  fit to the shaft with a drop of superglue.
This will hold them for installation, where grease is normally used.
Don't expect these shims to be easily retrieved next time.
If your case originally had the fat shim, it may still be in there
somewhere:). Raising the dizzy drive shaft to where it should be
will hopefully not compromise the gear engagement, but there may
be an unusual wear pattern established from previous improper use.
You should be able to inspect for that down the dizzy port.

Seth is not subscribed to VB, this was a cross-post, so be sure
to cc sethmatteson_at_att_dot_net . Anybody else ? Ray ? E+B ?
