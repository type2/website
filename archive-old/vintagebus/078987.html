Subject: Re: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

 i haven't ruled it out completely, but i'm just not feeling inclined to do
it my self.
there was a minor leak at the axle boots, but the boxes seemed to be dry and
leak free. doesn't seem to me like the center section was very low, because
when i spun the axle by hand with plug out both rgb's filled and over
flowed.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; oh I dunno. if you give yourself time time rgbs shouldn't be very hard
&gt; &gt; to rebuild.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd consider making sure the entire transaxle (including rgb's) is
&gt; &gt; full and see what happens then. One theory I can come up with might be
&gt; &gt; a bus that sits for a while w/ a leak in the rgb. boxes run dry from
&gt; &gt; sitting and no more fluid to fill it with center section low. I guess
&gt; &gt; it could happen, right?
