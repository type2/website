&gt; I think one thing that needs to be pointed out about the proceedure
&gt; outlined in this post for cleaning out a heat riser tube is that it is
&gt; extremely dangerous. If you look at a can of caustic soda, also known as
&gt; lye, you will see the skull and cross-bones symbol. It is there because
&gt; that stuff is really that dangeous. It turns your flesh into soap using
&gt; the moisture in your skin. It does that to your eyes too. The damage can
&gt; be done before you feel it. It's especially foolish to use it with
&gt; boiling water. Don't do it.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that got the point across. It was a little OT, but I saw another
&gt; post just in the last few days that also mentioned using this stuff. Use
&gt; your lye for cleaning your drains only. Follow the directions and heed
&gt; the warnings on the label. Lets all be safe, please.

A good idea, but the warning is there to help you use the product safely,
not to prohibit the use of the product completely.

With my students, I occasionally use NaOH (lye) to actually make soap.
This stuff is nastier than Drain-o, but can be safely used if you use
simple common sense.  If a 9th-grader can do it, you can too!

First, make sure that you use splash-proof safety goggles.  These are
cheap, but be sure that they are the splash-proof variety, not the
vented kind used for impact protection.

Second, design your task to minimize the risk of contact with the NaOH.
Be sure that the manifold is securely propped or clamped to ensure that
it won't fall over and spill.  Have a jug of vinegar handy to neutralize
any spills if using caustics.  Baking soda for acids.  If you do get some
on your skin (or even think you might have) wash the affected area under
running water for several minutes.

Third, never put nasty chemicals in food containers.  Doing so is asking
for a disaster.  Since I'm a teacher, I use common lab equipment, but if
you use something from the supermarket (measuring cup, etc) be sure to
mark it so that it'll never be used for food ever.  In this same vein,
never eat or drink in the shop while using nasty stuff.

Fourth, banish the kids from the shop area when using caustics unless they
are capable of understanding the dangers involved.  I take about an hour
to go over the dangers with my students before they set foot in the lab
area

Fifth, never mix chemicals if you don't know what will happen.  Acids and
Bases are the obvious example, but you can also get into trouble with
combinations of bleaches and drain openers, and even water and acid
(always pour acid into water, not the other way around).

Chemicals aren't the devil's potions.  They are very useful and safe if
you take proper precautions.  Just because a particular application isn't
on a label doesn't mean that a substance cannot be used for that
application, but be sure of what you are doing before you proceed.

Having said that, I still think that mechanical cleaning of heat risers is
probably the best way to go, but I'm not the final word on it!
