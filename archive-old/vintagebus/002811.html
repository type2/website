Well, OK, not really &quot;new&quot;, and sorry for the silly subject line, but
there's another Type II gracefully docked in our driveway today!  Michele
and I have been on the quiet lookout for a '58 or '59 bus (hopefully Westy)
that would replace Michele's '58 camper she had in the past.  Well, this one
is not really a camper, but is is a &quot;modified&quot; kombi, and will work nicely
as a possible daily option driver for Michele and light camper.

Thanks to Todd, and his post :
((-----------------------
VW 1959 Bus, new motor, $2500. Call ###-###-####),

We called the dude, and he called back, and we called him back, and finally
got in touch, and talked about it last night, and decided to go see
it...meaning that we needed to awaken ourselves at 3:00 a.m. and get on the
road to Fresno by 3:30 in order to make it there before the heat around
8:00.  Got there fine, but what a grueling drive!  Looked at the bus, and
found many more things wrong than we thought from the guy's description, but
I gamely put forth an offer almost a third less than he was asking, and of
course he said no, as he was trying to recoup the dough he put into the
engine....and I thanked him, and wished him luck, and prepared to drive 4+
hours back to home, and as we were pulling out, he came running after, and
motioned for me to come back, and I offered another hunnerd, and the deal
was done.  Cool.  I think we got a good deal, which offsets all the work
that we now get to do!

Mechanically, this thing is potentially great...I drove home with brakes
that needed pumping before anything happened, and that thing was to pull
violently to the right....no ebrake, either.  But brakes is brakes, and I'll
fix'em.  The engine, which supposedly has about 1100 miles on it, is
supposedly an 1776, dual-port, single 34-PICT, and Monza exhaust (oooh,
rumbly!), feels pretty good.  It has an alternator, which is good, because
the fan on the full-flow oil filter and cooler sucks plenty of juice!  The
steering box is really worn, but the front end was supposedly gone through,
and besides the steering play, it feels solid.  And the tranny, which was
supposedly redone 4 years ago, right before the Prev PO blew the engine and
let the bus sit for 4 years, feels pretty good, although the shifting is
sloppy, and reverse doesn't need the push down action....I think the linkage
needs to be adjusted.

The body is missing metal in spots, and there's some nasty &quot;I wannabe a
barndoor&quot; paint on there, which is coming off, and there's plenty of reason
Ronnie should be feeling a tingle, 'cuz there's plenty of stuff I'm gonna
need!

Here's the M Code stuff.  We looked it up, and figured most of it out,
through Thom's registry and books...
It's actually a '58, right?  and the other question is what the h_at_ll is the
original paint?

13 11 8
372 175 181 544
US 231 SK 607 409982

We didn't need the complication, but ya gotta love 'em when they come!

Gene
