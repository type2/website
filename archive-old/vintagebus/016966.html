This is a useful data point.  However, most hotrodders care about
quarter-mile performance, not longevity.  At least all the ones I've
talked to figure on rebuilding an engine after every race, or at least
after every day of racing.  Does Fisher give supplementary comments
about the context he's using those numbers in?

Thanks.
