Subject: Re: [VB] Re: LED taillights

Hi Volks,
The best way if you want to use LED bulb replacements is to cut into the bulb 
holder another socket for a normal 1156 bulb and have the LED array in the 
old stock position.  This way there is enough draw to keep the signal flasher 
at a more normal pace and when the 1156 fails you can tell by the flasher 
change and still have a signal back there.

  Really though most fellow motorists are not paying anywhere enough 
attention to driving.  To really get thier attention when signaling a turn or 
lane change you have to have a yellow tinted signal.  We found this out with 
our 1963 Ghia running 12 volts lighting, when we went from stock all red 
taillights to the euro style yellow topped ones.  95% of the problems of 
other drivers trying to run us off the road and/or flip us off when we were 
changing lanes disappeared!!  So we have tried euro bus taillights or 
seperate vintage small round coned lensed lights bolted on the top of the 
license plate wired into the N. American taillight wiring so they signal and 
show brakes just like the taillights.  This latter sytem also gives one dual 
bulbs on both sides so there is alot less chance of having the signal on one 
side of your VW completely out!!!  Plus it works well on our pre-1961 bugs.

  While LEDs are an interesting possible lighting improvement you really have 
to first go through the wiring for a good cleaning, soldering, dielectric 
grease, and install a grounding harness from the taillights to the battery 
ground strap to make ALL your electrical system work properly.
