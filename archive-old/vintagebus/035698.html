&lt;&lt; does anyone know where i can get a cam plug to fit an early 40hp case?  i 
thought they were the same as 1600's but the ones i have dont fit.&gt;&gt;

Hi Josh,
They are the same as far as we know and have seen!  Are you finding the metal 
plug for 40-1600 or the more recent rubber plug for Mexi 1600 engines or are 
you dealing with a 36HP engine case?

&lt;&lt;also, could you still get a bus in 65 with a 1200cc, or were they all 
1500's by then?   &gt;&gt;
Depends where your bus was delievered to!  In USA then yes, for most Euro 
countries the 1300cc was it and we have found some VW dealer photo that shows 
the 1600cc was availible in 1964 somewhere in the world.  Eric&amp;Barb
