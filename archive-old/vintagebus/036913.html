&lt;&lt;  The local VW shop believes he has the bearings, but I 
am having trouble removing the inner races from either of 
the 2 outer bearings. I removed the lock ring on the upper 
one.  Neither one will come off, prying with 2 screwdrivers. 
Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;

Try getting a bearing splitter and puller.  The bearing splitter
will fit behind the inner race and the puller will then bolt onto
it.  I've used a harmonic balancer puller in the past with good
results and you can purchase a 'no name' splitter for just a
few dollars.
