  This is to let all of you out there know that I am a Creative Engineering
STOCKING dealer now. I will have Safaris in stock and all related parts, as
well as all of there other products. I will have 5 sets of Safari's here on
Thursday, already have 1 here to examine. I also will have Westy racks,
Deluxe body molding (in stock now), pop-out frames, jail bars and seat back
bars, also the ends for the seat bars, assorted Safari parts. Basically
there whole product line, sans disc brake kits (but I can get them). We are
sorting out the pricing, but you will save  on shipping, etc.
