hey all,
is there some trick to getting the nuts off of the #3 and #1 exhaust
studs?  I want to change my heater boxes...I've been soaking the nuts in
penetrating oil and have gotten 2 off so far.  The bottom ones.  Now for
the top ones.... is there a special tool? sheer brute force? or should I
yoink the motor and replace my clutch while the derned thing is out...
thing is that my bus is a daily driver.... which kinda sucks because
that really limits how much work I can do on it at a time.

I've pulled a motor already, so I know whats going on there and I have
all the necessary tools/jacks so...
hmm
mebbe I'll do it this weekend...but I would like any tricks and tips
first.

Those brand new heater boxes sure do look nice in my garage...now if
they were only on the bus...

ps.  engine is a 1600 SP
