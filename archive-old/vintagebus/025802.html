&gt; Hey, hey, hey............Who you callin old? :~)

Sorry about that, and I did consider that adjective a bit before I sent
it, but I think maybe the oldtimers know a few more tricks than the
younger gurus do... 

I realize there are younger gurus out there... Thom, Dave E., Dave R.,
Clara, Sean... hmmm...  Ok, I'll accept advice/criticism/encouragement
from ALL gurus out there!

Didn't mean to offend anyone. I just thought I was getting old...

35, not yet a guru but getting there
