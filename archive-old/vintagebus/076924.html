Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal removal, WMDs, and accelerator cable

I did a wire repair on my 61's accelerator cable when I got the bus in 95.   
Still works.    I keep a spare cable behind the drivers seat.. sort of stuffed 
under the outer springs, so it's there if I need it.  But It never broke 
since I had a spare cable in the bus..

I'm not sure if I'll bother to replace it with a new one.
The ones they make nowadays are of braided cable, not like
the originals made of a single strand of strong wire. The
braided ones break at least once a year, while the wire ones
last almost forever.
The bridge delay is part of the oil companies power play... they are keeping 
the road bad to sell more grease to fund the war to control the oil sources.  
Duh!
