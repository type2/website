Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

I had a 61 single cab years back and I useed '34 Ford taillight lenses on
it. I did have to sand the edge all the way around between 1/16-1/8&quot;(I don't
remember due to I was married then and that caused brain damage) in which my
belt sander with aluminum oxide belt w/ 120 or 180 grit worked real good.
You just have to go slow and easy. They fit great and were glass lenses. A
little darker but looked good. I have seen many different colorations of '34
lenses so you could probably find them close to the og color. And they are
alot cheaper. Use them and save your good ones.
