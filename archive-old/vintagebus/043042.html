List and VeeWee,

&gt;From my recollection, the heater cable replacement is a bit more complex
than thus indicated. If the heater adjuster knob is center-mounted, then
the lengths will be approximately equal, within half inch or better. If
the heater knob is under the driver seat, then the lengths are unequal by
about two inches. In addition, there is that small loop one has to make at
the adjuster in order to attach it to same. I have a heater cable prepped
for the unequal case, for my 67 walkthru. My 64 kombi uses the
center-mounted knob, and thus the equal length cable setup. I havent
replace heater cables in 20 years, but I do have the unequal cable as a
spare. My 64 needs new heater cable, and while under there to research it,
it seems extremely likely that the lengths are equal (bench seat,
center-mounted adjuster knob). 

There is also the situation of the required small loop at the bend point,
which needs to be factored into the solution. 

None of the currently available replacement cables I have seen have the
loop. You are expected to recreate it yourself. It is about 5/16 inch
diameter to fit into the adjuster thingee, where there is prolly a pin to
hold it by the loop. Grease your cable on the way in.

Really the best way is to
&gt; install the cable with the heater knob barely threaded on it's mount.
Crawl
&gt; under the rear and pull on the ends of the heater cable to take out
slack and
&gt; measure the differances of length from the tubes to the ends of the
cables
&gt; between them.  If one side is longer than the other then clamp a vise
grip on
&gt; the shorter end to keep it from being pulled back into the tube.  Go up
front
&gt; inside the bus and remove the heater knob and pull lightly on the cable
evenly
&gt; at first and when the vise grip stops the one end of the cable then pull
a
&gt; little more on the other cable end and make your adjustment.
