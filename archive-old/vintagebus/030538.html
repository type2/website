Steve Boeckel is the one who bought my 57 23 Window. He seems like a really good guy. His busses are expensive but they seem to be above and beyond what most people build. He is or was a Mercedes mechanic who seems to have found a genuine love for deluxe busses. I have not bought anything from him and have no real
connection to him. The negotiations on my bus went smoothly and he paid promptly.
Hope this helps,
