We just got back from Kelley Park. Quite a nice show. We drove our '63
bus 389 miles round trip for its &quot;maiden&quot; trip. I want to tank all the
list members who have responded to my various queries over the past
several months. Pete in Fairfield supplied the '67 tranny that has
proved to be very nice; several responded to my questions about tires.
We finally went with Cooper Trendsetter 205/15/75. Engine is a 1600sp.
This is the farthest I have driven a bus. Speed was generally 55-60
where flat.
