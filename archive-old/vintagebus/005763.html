Subject: Ignitions and engine kits

It's new engine time here and I'm looking for information about who has good
quality engine kits. I know Gene Berg has great stuff but I only have about
$2000 to work with. What I would like to put together is basically a stock
motor with a stroker crank. I'm not looking for a high rpm monster, i'd
rather it not even see 4000 rpm. Just looking for good solid parts and
workmanship. We do a lot of camping, and climbing the hills at 25-35 mph
with 20 cars behind me honking is getting a little upsetting. I saw in HVW
that Scat sells kits and thought they might be good, but could use some
input from other people. Also regarding electronic ignitions, any oppinions
on which one, I'm willing to spend a few bills on a good one if they exist,
are the compu-fire complete systems any good?
