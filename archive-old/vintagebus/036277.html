&lt;&lt; He has something wrong....he lives in the outskirts of Copenhagen. In the 
summer it rarely reaches 80 degrees F. About 8 years ago my wife was there 
and they had a heat wave. People were dying because of it.....it got to 85 
degrees! They weren't used to the heat. &gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
That is what we kind of thought!  Thanks for the info.  We drive our buses 
fairly well loaded on trips where we have to cover 400+ miles a day in temps 
up to and often over 85F during the summer with no big problems since making 
sure all the pieces are correct and driving properly for the weather 
conditions!  Eric&amp;Barb
