Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;another&quot; reproduction Safari window maker?

I think having a set of windshields that pop-open is plenty close enough to
the originals. They should just fit and install properly without too much
mod and preferably not leak.

I mainly believe it'd make more sense to have the frames be simular to the
side pop-out window frames as far as rubber is concerned. They should have
the channel on the outside of the frame for an outside rubber seal ON the
frame as well the rubber seal around the opening on the bus.
