Hi Everybody,

I know it's early, but I need the basic schedule for Jerome this year.  I've
been to the ABC site and see that it is Sept15-16, but do people show up
Friday for Camping?  I'm trying to plan my Vacation and want to hit the Grand
Canyon for the week prior and then go to Jerome for that weekend as I haven't
been to this show yet.  Hopefully, I will be doing this show in my 61 Sub
hatch towing my Heilite but we shall see how the roof transplant and building
the new motor goes.

Thanks,
Aaron
