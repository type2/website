Subject: Re: [VB] Spare tire  was Re: [VB] what size 15's for my walk
  through.

the spare 205 75 15 in my 61 does notprotrude out of the spare tire well, so 
as you say the seat back is slightly mushed forward.   However, when they 
switched from full bench to 1/3 2/3 bench they did make the spare tire well 
deeper.   This means a 205 75 14 spare in my 65 did not influence where I kept the 
seat.  I think the 2/3 side does lean on the spare though.  whatever.

Ya, it is tricky with the walkthru spare well in back, it is narrower than 
the usually used size of tire.  I advise to sell the walkthru and get a bench 
seat bus.  walk throughs are annoying, anyway.

&lt;&lt; In back as in a walk thru bus?  If so then you are stuck with a type 1 
radial 
 165SR15 on a bus 15&quot; rim as a short distance get to the nearest tire place 
 for repair or replacement of the bus sized radial.  The pre-1963 front bench 
 seats with the two adjustments to the seat back can fit in the 205/75R15 as 
a 
 spare if you do not mind having the seat back adjusted forward.  The later 
front 
 bench non-walk thru 2/3 bench seat does not have this adjustment and we are 
 pretty sure you are stuck again with a 165SR15 radial.
