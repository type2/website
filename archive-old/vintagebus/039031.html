&gt;Let me know what you think. Should i buy$ her???

Thanks for taking the time to post the pictures.  I still have trouble
seeing how this setup could provide enough cooling air for the engine.  But
I guess it must work.

On the other hand, it would be very cool being able to drive with the side
gates laid flat.  With the regular side vents, I would imagine you'd
overheat very quickly if you covered them with the gates.  Do you suppose
this was why they built these utes (see, I'm catching on already:-))
differently?
