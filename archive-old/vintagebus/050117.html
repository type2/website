Quoting an old message from the archive:

&gt;18: Archway Imports (a parts place in St. Louis) lists in their
&gt;19: catalog a &quot;Solex Carb/Bushing Kit&quot; which looks from the picture
&gt;20: to be a drill bit, a reamer, and some bushings.  I imagine
&gt;21: you would need a drill press to make sure it was square.  They
&gt;22: also sell just bushings (8 and 3mm, where they go I know not).
&gt;23:
&gt;24: The tool kit (item # 2050) is $55, the bushings (8mm: #2051,
&gt;25: 3mm #2052) are $2.  I haven't used this kit, and don't
&gt;26: even know if it's the appropriate thing.  Archway's #
&gt;27: is XXX-XXX-XXXX.

But I called and this kit is discontinued. Does anybody have a mail order
source for the reamer and the bushings for a 34-3? My wife's bus is
leaking
&gt;from the accelerator pump linkage.
