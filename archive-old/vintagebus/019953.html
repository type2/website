Ebay is OK, I buy stuff on there all the time.  For those of you who don't
know, I run a fledgling ebay clone, unofficially dubbed &quot;ThomBay&quot; in which
I've tried to capture the good bits of ebay and fix what I (and others)
thought was wrong with ebay, the #1 issue being dishonest practices such
as shilling.
