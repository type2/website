&gt;GL 5 is only used on VW auto transaxles in the final drive only. Manual
&gt;tranaxles cannot use GL 5, the high sulphur content will etch the brass
&gt;syncro rings. Also your transaxle will start making noises like it is on
&gt;it's last leg. [ask me how I know!]


Yikes! 

I just checked the archives and now I am shakin' in my Birks. It seems the
GL5 that was put in my tranny about 400 miles ago is apt to eat up the
synchros. A prudent person would run out tomorrow and search for GL4 rated
gear oil but this might prove to be a chore based on the previous post. I
feel I must take action.

Here are the questions.

The GL5 has been in the tranny about 400 miles and 12 days. Is this long
enough to do damage?

What of the multi rated oils that are GL4/GL5?

If I drain the tranny and add the GL4 with that be enough to remove the
offending chemical?
