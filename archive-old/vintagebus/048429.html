Subject: Rubber pad on inside of headlight bucket

I just rescued a 66 walk-through microbus from a local junkyard!  Its very
rough but not so rusty.  Vandals had busted out all the glass and gauges.
Probably why it was there. ...  Anyway, there was a oval-shaped rubber pad
on the inside of the headlight bucket on the driver's (left) side on the
day I found this thing out in the weeds.  The next day when I came to pick
it up, the pad was gone.  I was a little miffed, but too excited about
getting this bus to make a scene.
Anyone know what this pad is for and where can a replacement be found?
TIA
Mike
