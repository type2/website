Yes, they are just hanging there.  I've got the stands under the spring tubes.  Will the tranny be hurt with the axles and wheels sitting like that??

Are the wheels just hanging in the air or supported?  This itself will cause
leaks... when I had my VW up on a stand at a VW repair place the guy
explained to me how unsupported wheels caused leaks at the tranny side...

I posted about the leaking boxes a few days ago, and now it seems the
transmission is leaking.  Note that this thing hasn't even been pushed
down the driveway yet (still on stands), and its leaking like the
Titanic.  I filled it up with 85/90 weight oil...is this correct?  The
new leaks seem to be coming from the side covers.  Are there seals in
there that I should replace?  I'm trying to get away with a little tear
down as possible...how hard is it to pull these covers and replace any
gaskets??  Do I have to unbolt the boxes from the spring plates to do
this??

Thanks.

Steve
