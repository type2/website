Spoon latches    20 a piece X 6, 120.00
walk through seats      75.00 pair
deluxe steering wheel with button 75.00
taillights                        150.00
headlights                        30.00 pr.
skylight glass   20.00 a piece X 8, 160.00
corner window frames and glass      200.00    
jail bars                             75.00
rear deluxe glass                    100.00 (isn't it different)
all outside handles                 100.00
all the panel trim                   75.00
front bumper with trim               75.00

these are conservative estimates (forgot the shelves) considering what s#it
sells on E#%y for and I didn't even account for the trans, spring
plates(100.00) core at Wolfgang. steering box, trans, front end and all the
switches etc. home run deal for the E#$yer.
so if the owner did the same and his reserve is what he thinks he could sell
the parts for without the hassle.

I still think Thom needs this bus to compete with Richard (aka Rustybus), he
could stand a chance.

I hope my 55 deluxe isn't as bad as this or maybe I'll just part it out,
arrival date is a week from next Wednesday.

&gt;&gt;What about the shelving system they got in there where the back seat goes?
Rare business man accessory or is that where the farmer put his chickens? :)

&gt;&gt;
Saving that shelving is a given, I've already thrown my rear seat in the
trash as I intend to be the high bidder just to get those shelves!!
