 In prep for the up coming events, I'm going to replace (finally) the 
tattered paneling thats been in place of the correct gray door/kick panels.
 
 The PO drilled holes willy nilly and I don't know which one are the original 
ones.  Does anyone know the correct number and spacing of the screws for the 
front door panels?  This is pre-65? (with the press in clips)busses with the 
screws and alum. washers.
 
 Thanks.

you know, I dont think there was an exact spacing.   For the press in clip 
there are, so you can use one door as a template,  then clip it right onto 
another door.   I was tidying up the front of my 61 (screw on panels), and 
picked some panels of the same colour but were from another bus, and the 
screw holes do not line up.  well randomly someof them did.  

but they did use the same number of screws and general spacing.  I would have 
to go count.
