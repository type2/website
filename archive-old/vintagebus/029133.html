I'll share a couple of stories about judging.

1991.  Deer Park Winery in Escondido. Gathering on the Green.  The 'shoe-in'
favorite for 'Best of Show' was the 'Varney (sp?) Bentley'. A one-off custom
bodied '3? Bentley roadster.  Had just completed a ground up restoration by
one of the better restoration shops up LA way.  A couple of months earlier had
been the 'Salon' car of choice in R&amp;T magazine.  In the R&amp;T article it
mentioned that restoring just the chrome had set the owner back a cool 100
big.  Frog skin upholstery.  We're talking a $750k car here folks. ($100,000
at the chrome shop!!!)

During the judging, the folks showing it (not the owner, he couldn't be
bothered) spent the better part of an hour getting it started.  It had come in
in a covered trailer.  Finally got it running and smoked out the show.  Leaked
oil all over the grass.  Still an awesome car.  Rich!

When the judging was completed, the best of show winner was the owner of a
1956 Chevrolet 210.  That's a bottom of the line Chevy.  Car was restored as a
NASCAR racer.  Period Sun tach, open pipes, 265 V-8 with a correct vintage 4
bbl.  Roll bar.  Correct FIRESTONE race tires.  Correct paint and correct
racing stickers in the correct locations.  Provenance showing the car's
history as a racecar.  B&amp;W 8x10s with a paragraph on the back of each one...
Not at all 'stock' but very original and very nicely restored.  

The Bentley owner was so pissed that he hasn't shown the car again.  It was
only about 85 points if I remember.  It was pretty, but it was not a show winner.

A year earlier, the best Italian went to the owner of a '68 Alfa Guiletta. 
Drove it from Newport Beach and entered on a whim.  It had rained on the way. 
The car was not perfect, but it was the most honest car there.  It obviously
had been driven.  Daily.  And kept up.  Beat out half a dozen Ferraris and
Masers.  One of the Ferraris that this lowly Alfa beat out was a '65
California Spyder.  (The last CS that I saw changed hands for 3.5 mil.)

The point is that judges are humans, not computers.  Fudge points are given
for driving it there and the competition gets a whole lot tougher when it's
obvious that you just rolled it onto the trailer and drug it to the show. 
&quot;Show&quot; cars have a MUCH higher standard!

Last story.  I also saw a '71 Super Beetle beat out the Mercs and Porsches in
the German catagory.  Same show.

The lesson?  You show your car.  You learn what is not correct.  You change
it.  Each time you show it you get a little closer to perfection.  Eventually
you have a winner!  The great thing about VWs is that as far as concours goes,
they're cheap.  You could put together a 95 point car easily for about $5000. 
Most other makes will require five to ten times that investment.
