Chuck, 

With regards to the accl. cable, this is what I do.  

1.  Install throttle tube through fan housing.  Take a small band clamp and slip it over the tube and up against the back (FIF)of the fan housing.  Tighten it down..now the tube will stay put.

2. Before you install the cable, take a length of gas line or any appropriately sized rubber hose.  Shoot some grease in there so it comes out the other side.  slip one end on to the throttle tube and the other end onto the accel. chassis tube where it exits the frame.  Make sure the length of hose is cut to length and not too long (since it might kink the cable).  This will keep the accl cable from rubbing on the tranny housing.  Install the cable.

I have a 67 tranny in my 62 and no problems with the latter box.

I have no experience with the carbs...sorry.

Steve
