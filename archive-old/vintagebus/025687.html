I think the split should be 71 and earlier and 72 and later. makes more
sense to me, and I told Thom FitzP that some time ago... but didn't want
to grouse too loudly since the split is WAY better than back when what
is now three lists was one (Yes, Vanagon was even part of the original
list), and Thom does infinitely more to make this list happen than I do.
But I still thaink a 71 has more in common with a splittie than it does
a 77 FI 2 liter hydraulic lifetr disc brake sporting baby-shit green
piece of german floatsum. Not that I have any opinion on the subject.

So anyways, I think that the wisdom, is, if it also pertains to a split
bus, ask away. But don't expect to be suffered lightly when asking about
how to rebuild the airbox in your late loaf.   

I for one would rather hear questions about upright engines here. I own
a bay upright, but hope to get rid of the turd as soon as possible.  :)

&gt; Howdy folks-
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 68 Riviera hardtop with a 1600 sp motor.  I have been subbed here
&gt; for a month or so, and find the upright engine content refreshing compared
&gt; to the type2 loaf list, which I have been reading for quite some time.
&gt; 
&gt; I know it's a loaf and that this is the splitty list - but how would
&gt; posting questions  (about engine stuff for example) go over?  I just posted
&gt; to the loaf list about a clutch problem.  I get the feeling there's as much
&gt; or more wisdom here as there on a topic like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
