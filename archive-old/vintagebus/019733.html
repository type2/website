 Fun and games with the bus all day today!  My goal: put in the tranny and
engine, maybe do the brakes if I had time.  My accomplishments: tranny :-)  

First make note: new shift couplers do NOT come with set screws.  I should have
known that, having ordered the old rubber box couplers before, but hey...last 
time I ordered a coupler, I actually had a broken one in my hand.  This bus was
kinda missing the coupler.  I wound up using two plain old fashioned bolts, 
they'll do until I can get the real deal.  

Replacing the shifter bushings was cool.  It was made easier since the old
ones were nowhere to be seen, so moving the shifter made a really neat gravelly
sound.  Getting the front part off was easier than I had heard, only requiring
minor coaxing with a hammer, pliers, and vice-grips, and when I pulled the rod
out the bus lost some weight, a big pile o' dirt and crap came out along with
it.  New bushings snapped into place, lots and lots of grease everywhere and 
back in it goes.  No gravel now, smooth.  I repaired the rear boot with RTV and
plugged it back in, it looks really nice.

So now all this great stuff is in my bus -- greasy shift rod + bushings and a
coupler.  Tranny goes in...in the interests of saving words, it took a while.
But it wasn't too bad really, it's just really awkward.  Figured out I should
use 15mm nuts instead of 17mm on the tight spot on the front mount, wished for
a 26mm socket but used vice-grips and an adjustable wrench instead, and just
put that baby in there.  Looks different now: I've never seen this bus with a
tranny, unless you count the bug tranny that was falling out of it when I
bought it.  Also of note, no wing nut, and you won't find a metric one without
one of those fastener stores, I think.  I hunted around town briefly but I will
have to settle for using two nuts on the clutch cable until I can get a wing
nut.

Brake drums all 3 looked really nasty.  Sanded them one by one...that one is
fine, this one has pits...the nastiest one actually cleaned up really well and
is going in instead of the one with the pits.  I haven't had a chance to look
at my front drums yet.

I had a recurrence of electrical gremlins today.  I installed an
unknown-condition starter, and turned the key...nothing.  Checked the starter
by shorting the solenoid with test leads, and it works.  Try the key again,
still nothing.  Tap the solenoid with a hammer, try the key, nothing.  Since
I have a locking steering column the next step was easy, I shorted the hot wire
to the solenoid wire up front, and it worked.  Hmm.  Took the electrical part
out, turned it with the screwdriver, nothing.  Turned harder -- and it works.
Worked it back and forth several times, and I didn't have to turn it as hard
for it to work.  Mounted it back in, pressing up on the electrical portion a
bit so the tumbler wouldn't have to go as far, and it works now.  Yay!  So I
took the spare switch back upstairs.  This probably explains why the PO thought
the switch in the bus was bad.

...and that's as far as I got.  The electrical problems should truly be GONE
as I have already run the engine and I know that it works.  Haven't had a
chance to run it in the Westy yet though.  Very tiring day, but satisfying!
I finally put the passenger's seat back in today too, and while cleaning out
the under-seat area found a rolled up joint and some matches to go with it.
That's twice :-)

Yesterday, Dave E, Joe Clark, Ted, Jeff and I went junkyarding.  Everybody 
found some pretty cool stuff for ridiculously cheap, probably the best was 
the VWOA tow hitch.  I was happiest with the two painted hubcaps I found, as
I had been hunting a set for a while.  Just need two more...
