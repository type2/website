difference in the cold months.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; After reading through the owner's manual for my '67
&gt; Westy (thanks Thom -
&gt; excellent reference), the only thing really new to
&gt; me was the paragraph on
&gt; the air cleaner intake flap:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The weighted flap in the air cleaner intake pipe
&gt; must be free to move in
&gt; the winter and the cool seasons. If the average
&gt; temperature is above 50° F
&gt; (10° C), the flap should be fixed open by jamming
&gt; the lever under the ridge
&gt; on the intake pipe.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I've been driving this bus for almost 10 years,
&gt; replaced the long block with
&gt; a rebuilt one 2 years ago, and never knew this.
&gt; Before the bus I had a '73
&gt; Super Beetle (my first car - auto-stick...ugghhh!),
&gt; then after I totaled it,
&gt; I put its engine in a '64 beetle body (wish I still
&gt; had that!)....anyway,
&gt; paper filters until I got the bus in '91.
&gt; 
&gt; After reading this, I went ahead and &quot;jammed&quot; the
&gt; flap under the ridge. I
&gt; haven't noticed any difference in performance, but
&gt; if that's what VW said to
&gt; do, that's what I'll do. Is this a &quot;warm-it-up&quot;
&gt; thing? If not &quot;jammed&quot;, the
&gt; thing opens as soon as you give it gas, so I assume
&gt; it must be something
&gt; about keeping the air warmer while idling?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, after all the literature I've read on
&gt; air-cooled VW's, I've never
&gt; heard of this. Not even from Muir. Then again, I
&gt; don't have Bentley's guide
&gt; (yet).
&gt; 
&gt; I would bet there's a lot of people out there who
&gt; don't know this, but
&gt; then - is it really important?
