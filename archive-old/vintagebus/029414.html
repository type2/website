&gt;Yesterday I put my thumb through my driver's side vent window in my late
'55 Single Cab... I guess the glass must be really brittle from age as the
outside edge was bubbly and only a slight pressure shattered the window.
&gt;
&gt;PS: Are all non-barndoor splitty doors and vent windows interchangeable?
&gt;
Ouch!

I guess it depends if you care about correctness.  Your '55 Single Cab should
have large logo Sekurit glass and an early style window latch (used until
'56?).

That Sekurit will either be really easy or really hard to find but later
ones fit so who cares for now?

The later latches will work too, although black ones are not generally available,
a lot of people scuff up the chrome ones and paint.

I'd like to hear some tips on removing the vent wing glass.  They came out
real easy in my Type 3s but I tried to remove the glass from a scrap window
frame I had this weekend and it cracked.  Luckily it was some cheesy replacement
glass and not the real stuff so I busted the rest out with a hammer.
