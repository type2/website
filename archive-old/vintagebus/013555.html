I recently (about a month ago) replaced the boots that go on the rear axle of
my '65 Kombi. There is one on each side, transmission side of axle(as opposed
to wheel side. These were split type boots, lots of little bolts and nuts to
hlld them together. I don't remember which manual I read regarding their
installation, but it didn't mention anything about lubrication wiht the boots.
How does this area get lubricated, is it from somewhere else? Did I screw up,
should i have put some lubrication grease in there?

thanks
kevin
