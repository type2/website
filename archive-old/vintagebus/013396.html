Talked to the guy today... He bought it at an auction.... only 12,000
miles... supposedly all original.. with only one or two small body
dings.... Solid and no rust.. as in no rust... This could be a real gem
.... I am not into panels myself but even I am tempted on this one...But
it is in Jackson... Cali... way up north from me... Dudes asking 3500 or
best offer... I may go take a look at it next weekend but anyone really
interested give him a call at 209 743 0622. Oh and it has some stupid
toyota side mirrors on it as apposed to stock... But from the sounds of
it it is in sweet and original condition... If someone does check this
out right away how bout an email to me about how nice it really is... If
not I will post after I see for myself...  Oh and if there is any 15 or
21 splitties for sale out there how bout a heads up this way... Working
on an intial budget to buy for about 3500.... So if you know someone with
one collecting rust and dust send it my way....
