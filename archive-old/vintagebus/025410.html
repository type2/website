Subject: Stuck Gas Gauge ?
Message-ID: &lt;374F1A56.855D2DE_at_bitstream_dot_net&gt;

After 5000 miles of a nearly trouble free trip from Minneapolis to the Canadian Rockies, my fuel gauge became stuck at just over 1/2 a tank only 200 miles from home. I think it is from the tank sender as the needle in the gauge up front goes down when the key is turned off, perhaps the float is stuck. Anyway, is there a way to rebuild these units? Is it possible to
get them out without pulling the engine?

Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis '67 Westy, '56 SC
