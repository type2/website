Subject: estimates

First of all... I should have known that seat question i asked... it
won't bolt up and doesn't have the wheel well cut outs... too early in
the morning..hehe

2nd..
I took a trip to the body shop the other day (many of them actually) and
only found one that was willing to work on the bus...and not too far
away from my home.  Either nobody wants to do any rust repair, or
everyone is STILL backed up with hail damage... it hailed back in May.
To fix the rust on the bus (a little in the rockers) and fix all of the
dents (lower nose, one rear corner, and a couple dings here and there)
and then respray the bus below the beltline would be about 1200.  To
respray the top half of the bus would cost about 1800 (including the
other work).  To do everything in and on the bus (fix all dents/rust and
respray the whole thing) including all of the interior, engine
compartment, etc.. and fix little bubbling rust where the seat stand
meets the bulkhead, and a pinhole in the front floor board, and
replacement of jack points would cost about 2800. These are estimates of
course, but he says that they would be pretty accurate.  He also said
that if I wanted to do the whole bus, I could come over to the shop and
take out the interior, windows, seats, etc... and that would lower the
cost.  I want to do this over the winter so that I don't have to just
store the bus, and he said that would be no problem and that they would
just work on it when they weren't busy, and they would keep it indoors
for me. (this way I don't have to pay another place for storage)
He said that he would want to replace the whole rocker instead of just
patching it, and that he would weld the bottom lip in, but use some sort
of 3M seam sealer to bond the upper part of the rocker to the body, so
there wouldn't be any warping.  I guess they've used the stuff on a lot
of cars, and cars have come back and been in accidents and the bond
didn't break or anything.  Plus...its a body shop, and I would trust
them to know what they're doing.

Do these estimates sound about right?  I think they're
reasonable...especially since he was the only one who said he'd do the
work.  Also, I guess the paint won't be a problem...I just have to bring
in the codes and then they'd cross reference them.
