Subject: L-82 sub

Ed
The closest thing I have just found to L-82 silver/white is Dupli-color High 
preformance wheel coating stock # HWP 100 White. Most auto parts in so. cali 
carry it for around 5 bucks a can or Wally World (Wal-Mart) has the 
Dupli-color Wheel paint for $3.50 a can but may have to order it for you. A 
friend had left a can of it at my house that he was going to paint his rims 
but did not. I grabbed it to use as regular white paint and painted a 
bracket with it. After my paint matching search a year and a half ago for a 
sub for L-82 (tested a few different brands and colors on an OG paint 
bumper) I came up with a lowes bisque colored paint. But the Dupli-color 
paint blows it in the weeds. Now have 10 wheels and 4 bumpers to repaint.
