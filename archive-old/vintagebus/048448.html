Subject: Bus on Fire (long)

I've been quietly lurking here in the back ground since my return from
South America early this summer. Now its taken a fire to get me back on the
list.
Last week I had replaced a seal in one of the reduction boxes and adjusted
all the breaks. Took it for a quick drive up to the gas station, filled her
up and decided to head down the road to pick up a video in town.

Just as I got into town the bus motor gave a lurch, misfired for a moment
and carried on. Almost instinctively I reached down to switch over to
reserve when I remembered I'd just filled it up. Thinking this need closer
inspection, I spotted a landing across the road, along side another gas
station. As I coasted in, smoke began bellowing out through the window
heating vent as well as from the vent at my feet. I usually keep the vents
open half way to get heat flowing through both channels. Now I was getting
hit by smoke from the wind screen and floor boards.

Leaped out of the van with church key in hand and as soon as I opened the
engine hatch  got a wosh of flames, Reached in and switched the main
electricals off (the PO had installed a main switch to cut all current from
the battery, with the exception of two in-bay trouble lights). Anyway, I
could see that the flames were concentrated on the left side of the engine,
but just under the edge of my full gas tank. Fortunately this is the side
opposite the gas lines, pump and filter, so I figured this gave me a bit of
an advantage.

Slammed the hatch closed and ran into the gas station. Pushed up to the
girl at the cash and terrified her by shouting &quot;My car's on fire, get me an
extinguisher, NOW&quot; She reached down and grabbed a nice new one and as she
stood trying to explain how it worked I dashed back to my bus. As I
approached, I could see this was not a sight for the brave of heart or
level headed. Deep bellows of smoke were pouring out of the side vents, and
people across the street we stopping one another pointing at the spectacle.
I even saw one young couple pick up the baby from he pram and were pointing
his wobbly head to the sight of my van.

I was closing in on panic, watching by bus burn, but I got the hatch
opened.  Anticipating another combustion, I had the extinguisher primed and
ready. One hand held the hatch, one the extinguisher tank and somewhere in
between the hose was being pointed into the opening. Sure enough as soon as
a fresh supply of air rushed in flames leaped. But, two long shots put the
fire out and a third killed the demon for good.

I sat down and must have stared at the mess for about 15 minutes before I
was composed enough to call my wife and the rescue committee. Got the bus
towed back to home, and the next day I and a neighbour did a survey on the
damage. All in all it doesn't appear too bad. After I washed out all the
chemical from the extinguisher, I could see that most of the damage was the
result of the electrical cables leading from the bulkhead under the gas
tank to the regulator. This in turn started burning a small patch of sound
damping instillation, and although that panel didn't burst into flames it
smoldered, and was probably the cause of all the dense smoke. The cables
and the insulation though did burn to a crisp. These flames also burnt up
the spark-plug wires to the right cylinders.

As the engine and engine room is keep very clean -no oil, grease or grub-
there was little else to ignite. I can see that even though I try and keep
the bus trim and neat always checking gas lines and making sure no cables
are frayed or loose, it seems to me that the electrical cables clipped to
the doghouse cooler shroud were the source of the fire. I figure that the
metal clip had vibrated enough to cut through the electrical cables and
short me out. That was probably the first hesitation I felt. Anyway from
there the insulation started burning down the length of cable until it hit
the grommet into the fire-wall. The sound proofing material started
smoldering and so on.

To get my bus back on the road I'll be out to day re-working the wiring. If
all goes well, I figure I can cut back the burnt wiring and from the other
side of the bulkhead splice in new wires. I've got enough spare wiring of
the correct colour codes that I can consistently match the wire codes and
grades. Then I'll pack it up in insulation tape and feed the new extension
of the wiring harness back into the engine room.

Then before I start her up, I'll take my wife's car down to the garage and
buy myself a fire extinguisher. I can't believe that I was so lucky that I
was seconds from one, as disaster struck. I could just have easily been on
one of the surrounding country lanes and just stood by as my bus burned to
the ground. It's been said may times, but please do yourself and your bus a
favour and go buy an extinguisher. It need not even be very big. Two shots
and my fire was out. And by the weight of the can, there was a lot more in
reserve so even a little one may save your ass.

Anyway, I thought that I'd share that close brush with all of you. Sorry if
it went on a little long.
