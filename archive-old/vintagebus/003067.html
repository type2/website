&gt;&lt;&lt; I have a 66 Crew cab and was wondering if there is any way to install
roll
&gt; down windows versus the stock slide back windows. &gt;&gt;


You don't want roll down windows, you want to rest your arm on top of the
door.  The windows can be unbolted from the doors. If you want to get real
fancy, engineer some latches or solenoids to allow quick removal. A little
wood butchering would get you a nice door topper.  I've heard that the wind
doesn't blast in too much at speed with them out.

I have 4 windows on my Thing that get pulled off for arm-hanging. I remove
them completely about May and store them in the garage until September,
along with the top. They've got a metal frame and two pegs that drop into
the door top. Hmmmm, a set of lightweight windows for the bus... with velcro
attached vinyl could be literally rolled down for summer time cruising....

Install a '68 or later bus in your driveway? Blasphemy!
