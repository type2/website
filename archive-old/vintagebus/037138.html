&lt;&lt; I have a 59' bus with the shifter close to the seat, I'm trying to get the 
 front section of the shift rod out so I can pull the front beam. I cant get 
 the front coupler off, I soaked the bolts for weeks, heated them and 
 eventually broke the heads off and had to drill them out. but I still cant 
 get the coupler off. Its to the point where I'm going to cut the rod. But 
 first I want to know if the long part of the rod that goes under the cargo 
 floors is the same length/diameter as the 67' rod I have. If not, does any 
 one have one they want to sell? I would like to just buy the short part that 
 connects the shifter to the longer portion of the shift rod if anyone has 
 one, keeping in mind its the early 59' type with the shifter close to the 
 seat. Or if you know a trick to get them off I would love to hear it. thanks.

the front part of the rod is hard to find- try to avoid damaging it. - used 
up to ch 501 xxx

the rear part is 211 711 171 up to ch # 835 087, and
p/n 211 711 171 B from ch # 835 088

thus they are also different.    also the earlier ones are harder to find, 
and the tranny must be out to pull it back out of the bus.   Eric &amp; BArb cut 
the nose of a parts bus I had in order to get this rear rod for their 60, to 
pull it forward

What I have done is the heat cold deal.  However, the shift rods in the front 
of my 61 are still together, and I want o pull the long rod out and replace 
those bushings before installing tranny.  Hm.   weel, it''s worked so far.
