Hey all,

Planning on my 1st engine pull this weekend.  Gonna replace the engine to 
apron/bus seal, oil cooler seal, rear main seal.  I have oil collection in 
the tin below the lower pulley which gets slung all over the place.  Anyone 
know the seal that is most likely fueling this mess?

Thanks,

Eric
