Subject: Re: [VB] Oil light puzzle

&gt; Why does my oil light stay on?  When I start the DC and the engine is cold, the light comes on when I turn the key then stays on as soon as the engine starts?  The oil level reads full, and the engine isn't hot.  I just had the engine rebuilt, 1904cc, it has an oil sump and an full flow oil filter.  Ideas?

-Bad sender?
-Shorted sender wire?
-Low oil pressure?
