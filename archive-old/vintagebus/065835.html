Subject: Re: [VB] play in the steering

From: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; The steering box is at the front under the end of 
&gt; the steering column.  It has an arm off it (pitman arm) that is connected
to 
&gt; the front end of the drag link.  The shaft the pitman arm goes to should
not 
&gt; go in/out of the Steering gear box (SGB).  Changing the SGB is a PITA, so 
&gt; hopefully that's not where all the play is.  A bad SGB also clunks when
the 
&gt; wheel is wiggled.   

My steering box has about 1mm to 1.5mm play on the shaft that the pitman arm
goes to.  Is there anything that can be done to this or should I just leave
it?
There is only one guy who can refurbishes the steering boxes properly in the
UK, but he is a retired engineer and only does a few now and again.  The
Split screen van club is raising money to have the tooling made up for the
parts to have them repaired properly but until then I can't get a
refurbished RHD box unfortunately.
I am aware that over adjusting the box can cause notchy steering and cause
the box to wear out more, just wondered if a small amount of play could be
taken out.  My box is very grimy, and doesn't look like it has been adjusted
for a long time.

Thanks
Paul
