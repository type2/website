&gt; &gt;Sometimes I feel the same way.  It's really a

&gt; Makes me wonder why they are so popular!?!?!?!
&gt; &quot;Trendy&quot; maybe? Give 
&gt; me a full SC bed anyday...with a storage area
&gt; underneath to boot!
I can't work it out.
I guess folks like the idea of being able to haul
their family as well as stuff.
Here in Australia DCs, particularly Bays, are like
gold.
People love 'em and there's been a whole movement
started by a local Type2 guru who specialises in
converting the bays to V8s &amp; V6s.
O.k., maybe it's blasphemy but the under-tray-area
gives you plenty of room for the radiator which
usually has to go on the nose in an unsightly fashion.
But, yeah, I'd prefer a SC.
They look cooler and when you slam them arguably
handle better.
Wait a moment.......I think I hear the sound of the
Vintage Police breaking the door down ;o)
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
