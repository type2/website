Subject: Re: [VB] My buses are going up for sale

Love is blind....... it sure can be but not enough for me to give up my
VW's. With owning 4, my collection of STUFF and all of the VW talk does not
tell a possible SO to be that she has not a prayer of a chance of ever
getting me out of VW's then love is not only blind but deaf and dumb to
boot. Yes I am divorced and yes VW's had a part in it (small part), but my x
never tried to get me to give them up (she did clean my garage
once.....never tried that one again) and she did enjoy driving them. Going
to shows w/o her was fine as long as she was at least invited so she could
turn the offer down (made that mistake more than a few times). Guess what I
am getting at is guys your SO may not like VW's and all the time and money
spent but if you leave them out in the cold they will never warm up. Put
some effort into what they like and invite them to be a part of your hobby.
We all can't have gal's that are into VW's like the great ones on the list
here but then too no need to have ones forcing you out of your VW's if your
SO knows your feelings and feels apart of what your doing. Communication,
sharing and listening to each other can make all the difference in the
world.
