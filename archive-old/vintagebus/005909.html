Hi,
I am having a few problems with the tranny in my 65.  Every once in a while in
4th gear, more often when someone sits in the back, going steady at about
40 -45 mph it makes a very loud whommm sound lots of base.  Any ideas.  It
does it infrequently to the point where I can not predict it.  But it only
happens at that steady speed.

Also the tranny leaks really bad.  As in I need to refill it every 1 1/2 to 2
months.  I have been reading and from what I can tell it must have been
overfilled sometime in its life and blown the seals.  Can these seals be
replaced?  I have been trying to get a new nosecone but RMMW has it back
ordered and Bus Depot is not answering my mail (tried twice, even put it in
with an order once). If it is possible would it be better to replace the seals
or wait out a new nosecone?

And lastly might the new nosecone solve the noise problem or should I be
looking for a new tranny also.
The noise happens whether the fluid is high or low.

This is on a stock 65 bus.

TIA
