&gt;I won a solar panal battery that plugs into your cig lighter.
&gt;What are they used for?

Recharging your battery at a very low rate.  It won't help much while
you're driving, but if you're parked for a day or three in a sunny spot,
it will help a little.

&gt;when do you plugem in?

When you have parked the vehicle in a sunny spot and want to charge up
the battery a little bit.  Check the directions that came with it; you
can leave most of them plugged in all the time, but some of them _must_
be unplugged when it's dark or they will drain your battery!

It's not much juice.  If one of your dash lights got stuck on, it would
&quot;outrun&quot; the charging provided by the smaller ones and still drain your
battery.

This doesn't apply in your case, but it's expensive juice, too.  JC
Whipme lists a few solar cells on their Web site.  Assuming that they
put out 15 V at their rated current, and that electricty from your power
company costs 10 cents a kilowatt hour, here's a comparo:

 Solar    kWh    Solar cell   Hours the solar cell
 Cell     from   output at    would have to run
 Price    grid   15 V DC      to pay for itself
 $17.99   179.9  0.04 A max   300,000 hours (68.4 years at 12 hrs/day)
 $39.99   399.9  0.08 A max   333,000 hours (76.0 years at 12 hrs/day)
 $67.99   679.9  0.50 A max    90,700 hours (20.7 years at 12 hrs/day)
$189.99  1899.9  1.00 A max   127,000 hours (28.9 years at 12 hrs/day)
$339.99  3399.9  2.00 A max   113,000 hours (25.9 years at 12 hrs/day)
$489.99  4899.9  3.00 A max   109,000 hours (24.8 years at 12 hrs/day)

Put another way, solar cell factories do not (yet) run on solar cells.

There are some applications for which solar cells _are_ a good solution,
like communications repeaters in remote locations (the desert, the
mountains, a geosynchronous orbit) where there isn't a handy socket to
plug into.  But for now, for everything else, they aren't a very good
idea.  One source I tend to believe has said that given the incremental
improvements in solar cells, the high-quality ones will be competitive
with grid power in 10 to 15 years.
