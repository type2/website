Subject: Re: [VB] 65' brake system question

Tracy,

If you're &quot;restoring&quot; your bus, and it has been
sitting for a while, EVERYTHING in the brake system
should be replaced!  This includes wheel cylinders,
brake hoses (most important), master cylinder, and
shoes (although I have been known to reuse good ones).
 And you should mike all the drums to make sure that
they are capable of stopping your bus repeatedly in
the heat of summer.

There's nothing worse than putting a great deal of
time and money in a vehicle, to lose it all with
less-than-perfect brakes, not to mention the pain and
medical bills that could occur.  I ALWAYS do a
complete brake job first thing when I'm resurrecting a
bus.

Enjoy your bus!

JP
