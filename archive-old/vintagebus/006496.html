&gt; piston, you would see the 1st ring gap at 9 o'clock, the 2nd ring gap at
&gt; 3:00, and the oil scraper at high noon (not sure whether AM or PM here)
:-)

hi nq,

    a lot of vw engine builders use the 10:00/2:00 method of ring gap
locating... i don't know that it makes all that much difference.

&gt; and extension measured with a feeler guage.  I've read the book but I'm
&gt; still a bit confused as to what exactly I need to measure or to do to find
&gt; out what size of shims I might need.

    do yourself a real big favor &lt;vbg&gt; and use the online compression
calculator... you'll still have to do the measuring first, but it'll make
figuring out the shim thickness a breeze:
