&gt;   Thank you for the info. I couldn't figure it out. I am looking at 2 
&gt; different hatchtops and the owners said there were SO 34, they both have 
&gt; the same interior ( mosaic) and non flip seat. So it appears that both of 
&gt; these hatch tops were ordered with a removable interior and not stationary. 
&gt;  

Hi Ronnie,
Youi are welcome!  Would be nice to have the Mcode plate codes from those!  
Though the codes on Westies are not always exactly accurate.  There are a few 
very early (1961) SO-34 that have a 23 instead of 34 Westie code on thier 
Mcode plate!  We think the SO-33s started late 62 or early 63 so the same 
Mcode slip up may have happened early on.  We have seen an all original SO-33 
Westie hatchtop with its ice box AKA frig.  Have also seen a complete SO-33 
interior for sale at our Vintage show years ago that had the same ice box, 
but it actually had a propane powered cooling system built into it.  The 
SO-33 also has the front/rear facing pair of 2/3 seats that convert with the 
table into the camping bed.  The SO-34 &amp; 35s convert the side facing seat 
into the bed with the two visable cushions and one stored under the back 
cushion.

&gt;   So did all SO 34/35 come with flip front seats?
&gt;   I guess I need one of those also to ad to my hatch top collection.
&gt; ronnie

As far as we know all SO-34 &amp; 35s came with the front bench seat that has the 
upper section flip over so volks can sit there facing backwards when camping.

&gt; ps. It would be really nice (if not done allready) if somebody would build a 
&gt; site of all the Westy camper interior variations. I have looked and have 
&gt; never found them all in one place on the net

We do have a small website about SO-34 &amp; 35 Westies you can take a look at:
