Subject: .Wanted: repro safari wiper shafts
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My friend is finishing up his single cab and needs some of the repro safari 
wiper shafts.

I talked to Rene who made them and he will not have any for a few months.

so does anyone have a pair they are not using ?

thanks for your help...................
