Subject: re:[VB] BBB VII update

Ellis is bringing Eurovan with old hippy inside. Deciding to grow my hair out
again while it lasts. What, like I need to worry about cruising for chicks? 

It has been years since I slash We have looked forward to attending a show or
show/campout. I think that we are coming out of the other side of extreme
burn-out syndrome. We are so amped to get out of Phoenix that we will even buy
Rubber Johnny a beer... Naw, crack ain't that cheap...yet.

Rain or shine we will be there as soon as we can make it. Estimated late Friday
night. We are betting on sunshine... Or windowpane, barrel whichever is
available. hahahaha.
Strong encouragement for the old school New Mexico crowd to attend. Even if
they are in Montery or Corporate Albuquerque. Would be a hell of a kick to see
the Oregon crowd again. Anyone named &quot;Mark&quot; strongly encouraged.

No need for anyone to buy raffle tickets because *I* deserve the drum-to-drum
tranny. Buskatiers check SW airlines or Am West on-line rates. Temp in Phoenix
has been in high 70's lately. Havasu is usually a tick higher than Phoenix.
See you at BBB!
