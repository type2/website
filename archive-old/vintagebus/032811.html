Hi Scott,
Did you find your distributor number on that website.  By the way what is 
that number?  Unless the directions say to time it while at idle, you need to 
staticly time it with the engine off.  To time a distributor at idle requires 
using a tach to get the right idle RPM.  Anywhere off this idle RPM and you 
change the timing.

&lt;&lt;Then I reved the engine and found my total advance only to be about 18 
 to 20 degrees BTDC. Could this be causing too much heat? Where do I set it 
 statically? (TDC or 7.5BTDC) and I'm looking for 28-30 BTDC total advance?  
&gt;&gt;
Again, need your distributor number.  We have found in VW literature that the 
timing must reach at least 20 BTDC at 2,500 RPM apperantly this is a rule of 
thumb for VW distributors.  Eric&amp;Barb
