Just make sure you don't start a fire with the Mag dust!It would hurt a
little.

Undo the rear mount nuts and lift the trans up so the studs aren't visible
so you won't hit them with the grinder.

 hello,
  could you direct me on the installation of a 12 volt
 starter onto a 1966 tranny. the engine and flywheel
 are built for a 1967 tranny and starter.
 thank you so much for your assistance.
 e.s.
  &gt;&gt;

I
you have to grind out (clearance) the bellhousing for the slightly larger
12V 
fly wheel  Use a grinder.  test install the motor, turn the engine round, 
hear grinds, it doesn't go in all the way?  great, pull it out- see the 
marks- thats where you need to grind a little more

although it is not impossible that it has already been clearanced.
