Hey All,

About a 1.5 weeks ago my bus started making this terrible sound when I start 
him up and then would sound fine (normal) once he was running.  A little 
background info is that I have a 74 1600dp w/ 12 flywheel and still and 
running a 6v starter so sometimes the starter doesn't engage in the flywheel 
and I have to rock the bus a bit to engage to start.  This new bad sound is 
not similar to this non engaging sound at all.  Only way I can describe it 
is it is a lound rattling racket and sounds ugly!  A fellow listee heard it 
last nite and thinks mayby my crank is tweaked or something...BAD NEWS!  
Well I listened to Muir's sounds and it doesn't sound like that to me sounds 
closer to the bent fan one.  Any ideas.  The bus seems totally fine  besides 
this starting issue.

Thanks,

Eric
