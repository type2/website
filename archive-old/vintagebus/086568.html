&gt;[brake lights not working]
&gt;
&gt;Turn signals work and taillights, and hazards lights.

If the hazard lights work, this points to it being in or upstream of the
9-prong box: fuse, wire fuse box to brake light switch, wire from brake
light switch to 9-prong box.

Do your wipers work?  They share a fuse with the brake lights.

&gt;Got under the Bus and have power to the brakeligth switch.

How'd you check?  With a meter or a test light?  Sometimes if you have a
high-resistance connection (corroded terminal, bad switch or relay
contact) the meter (tiny load) will show you battery voltage, but if you
put a test light on it (more load), the voltage will drop off.

&gt;Do power going out when pressed.

Is that &quot;Do have power&quot; or &quot;No power&quot;?  If &quot;no power&quot;, then possibly the
brake light switch is bad.

&gt;At 9 pin box, I run power to pin 54 and no lights come on.

If you know the power was good, this somewhat points to it being inside
the 9-prong box.

&gt;I hook up power the wire that runs to 54f on the 9 pin box and the
&gt;lights come on.

Your turn signal switch and the wires from the dash to the rear are
probably OK, then.

&gt;I run wire from 54 to wire from 54f and no lights.  Shouldn't they have
&gt;at least lit up the lights?

If you jumper the wire connected to 54 to the wire connected to 54f and
step on the brakes, then yes, the brake lights should come on.  If they
don't come on, then the problem is probably not in the 9-prong box.
