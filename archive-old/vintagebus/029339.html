Subject: A few more Q's while i'm at it (interior 65 deluxe)

Some other things come to mind.  If anyone can help that would be great.

All these apply to a stock 1965 deluxe microbus

Did the front inside door handles have springs behind them like the
erlier bus's did?

What are most of you using for rebuilding your seat's?  I plan to put on
TMI seat covers with there grey S&amp;P material.  I know that folks like WW
and WCM sell kit's for these.  What other (read cheaper) things have you
all done?  All the old stuff is shot on my seats

Anyone have a rear seat back in So. Cal they want to get rid of?  Mine
has a bad case of the rusty's.

Does anyone have a source for headliner tuck cord's?  (tuck's headliner
in at the top of the side window's)

Thanks for the help.
Matt
