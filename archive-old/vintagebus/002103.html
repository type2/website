Hey ya list


So I want to make my full length Z-bed match my drivers seat - problem was
that my drivers seat was in kinda bad shape - so, i took the vinyl off and
re-stiched the stiches - I threw away the upper layer of stuff and used
contact cement to gently hold the new pieces that I cut from one inch foam -
those are the pieces that run front to back between the vinyl and the horse
hair - then I put a layer of some sort of upostery foam on top of the horse
hair and put the vinyl back on - I must say, it did take a few hours to do
that re-stiching - but - da daaaaa - it look great - really great - there
were two tears but they were between the seams were the threads had split so
once I re-stiched all of those seams - the two tears are gone, gone, gone. I
really can't believe how great this looks.

Now I can go and get the carmel brown vinyl that I saw at the fabric store.
I wanted to make sure that I could repair my front seat before I went with a
vinyl z-bed.

After showing my wife the pics of Rex's newly recovered z-bed and telling
her how his wife sewed him a seat cover and it was her first sewing project,
I think I was able to shame my wife into making me a new cover for my z-bed.
