&gt; It is very popular with the Porsche crowd and works very well in my 911 with
&gt; the 915 transmission.
&gt;
&gt; SWEPCO is heavy duty stuff and cost about $35 a gallon.  I know a lot of
&gt; people are really picky about getting GL-4, but I figure since SWEPCO 201 is
&gt; GL-5 rated it meets or exceeds the older GL-4 specifications.

NO!  The numbers are not a matter of increasing specification, but of
completely different specification.  An oil can meet GL-5 and not meet
GL4!  Even a oil that meets both may not have the proper formula for your
VW transmission.

The chemical compostions are different and the GL-5 formula allows use of
levels of chemicals that can attack the metals in your synchros.  No
problem for the first year or two, but big problems thereafter!
