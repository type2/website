&gt; again the narrowest rim they recommend is 5&quot;. I guess my question is are
&gt; you all ignoring this and running them anyway? Has there been any
&gt; problems? I hate to go to a 14&quot; wheel but that would get me my minimum
&gt; 5&quot; width.


Mmmm.  Now, I'm no expert on 15&quot; bus wheels, but i'd swear they were
at least 5&quot; wide...at least the ones I've seen.  Are you sure you dont
have bug 15&quot; wheels?

Anyone want to back me up on the correct width of the 15&quot; bus wheel?  I'll
look in the Bentley when I get home...

(yes. a 4 or 4.5&quot; wheel IS to narrow for a 195 width tire. a 5&quot; is JUST
big enough to fit in a 195 without problems.)
