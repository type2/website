&gt; As far as I know, there are two different pitches on cam gears. The
&gt; 'regular', and the ol '36hp'.  Some people use the 36horse gears because
&gt; they have less angle to them, and reduce the side thrust.
&gt;
&gt; Don't know if this is what is causing it, but something to check......

&gt; Subject: [VB] Cam install question
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am rebuilding an engine for my 66 bus.  It came with a type 3 engine and
I
&gt; had the case cleaned and checked  by a machinist and bought a reground
crank
&gt; and cam and
&gt; bearings.  Everything was going back together well until I tried setting
the
&gt; cam in.  For some reason it will not go down into the bearings.  I have a
&gt; 1/4 inch gap on the bearing closest to the cam gear and it sets in the one
&gt; at the flyweel end.  I have reseated the crank a few times and I am sure
&gt; that it is setting correctly.  It looks like they do not mesh together.
&gt; My question is this.  Is it possible that the timing gear has a different
&gt; pitch than the cam gear and it would prevent it from seating properly?  I
&gt; looked on the cam and there is a number one.   I have heard somewhere that
&gt; there are different sizes.  Is there some trick to making this set
properly
&gt; or should I buy another cam?
