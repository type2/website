Subject: truck drivers on my road trip :(

well we servived. my wife and i made the trip from seattle to chicago last 
week and made it. we took a small two lane hwy for most of the time, but 
then we were forced to take a major freeway for the last third of our trip 
and were met by more semi's than cars on the roads. going speeds of 85-90 
mph! top speed for us was 50-55 in our '67 deluxe. we were honked 
at-followed very closely and at one point practically rear ended by a 
truck-the driver had to pull of to the shoulder to avoid hitting us and 
ended up driving next to us - WHILE WE WERE GOING 60 MPH! so we got off the 
busy highway and stuck to the country highway. i know we weren't going the 
speed limit, but where is the love on the highway?!?!
