Hi Josh,
  The arms are mounted on the throttle shaft that goes through the bottom of 
the carb and the throttle butterfly valve mounts on this shaft inside the 
throat of the carb.  If this shaft is snug in its bore through the carb, good!  As 
for the leaking if the throttle shaft is snug you have too much fuel going to 
the engine.  The leaking could be caused by several factors and could be 
causing all your idling problems because the engine is drowning in too much fuel 
at low RPMs.

1. Fuel pump rod reaches too high of position (check the VW Transporter 
Workshop Manual or the VW Service Manual for proper hieght) and you need to shim 
the fuel pump up to keep it from pressurizing the fuel too much and this in turn 
pushing down the fuel shut off valve and float in the carb.

2.  Worn out carb fuel shut off valve and/or it is missing its gasket.

3.  Cracked shut off valve float or for whatever reason it is just too heavy. 
 BTDT with the latter.
