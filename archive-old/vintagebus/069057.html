Subject: RE: [VB] What?  Nobody . . .

I have these going on...

I put the first one on the front of my bus a week ago, it pushed the
spindle as far down as it could go. I had to use a jack to push up the
eyelet so I could get it on. Now that it's on, I'm going to have to
jack up the bus another 4&quot; to get enough clearance for the tire. That's
some difference.

Huh? I'm not certain what you mean, how big is the tire?

So I'm going to have to get used to the tall ride, which is OK, but I
wasn't expecting that much of a difference. Your comments on the back
shocks worries me though. At least the back ones I have are used.

Were the spring plates set to compensate for sag? I think a split should
hold proper ride height without shocks. Are these adjustable shocks?
The engine is in it, right?

I guess the deal is to get some more weight into my bus. My floor is
full of holes which has probably made the front end too light. Maybe
some concrete reinforcement or patio bricks...

Sounds like my bus.
