Subject: Re: [VB] 356 Pulley results

Funny, that's really close to the  temp difference I got  with scoops... it 
ran ~20F degree cooler(actually 10C, which is about the  same),though I 
measured at the head .   
And a smaller pulley it's so much more attractive than   scoops.  
 
 I wish I had done that test as well as the scoops. 
I wonder if it draws more air through  the vents and makes the  engine 
compartment cooler.  
Would it run cooler with  both scoops and smaller generator  pulley?   if so, 
how much?   hmmm
 
Thanks for the info!!!!

My oil  temperatures were 20 degrees cooler than they were before the 
swap at the  same speeds. Since the engine was so much cooler I was able 
to drive  faster on the interstate. I was able to do 70 mph this year 
instead of 60  to 65 as in past years and my oil was still 10 degrees 
cooler than it  usually is on the interstate. I don't have a head temp 
guage, but I  checked my valves today, and found that I still had .004 
clearance on the  exhaust valves. I set them at .006 just before the 
trip. That's more  clearance than I used to find after a hot drive like 
that, so I think it's  safe to say that the heads were cooler with the 
Porsche pulley than they  were with the stock  pulley.
