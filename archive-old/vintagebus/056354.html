Subject: Fish Carbs?

To start off, a link: http://minnowfish.co_dot_uk/carbs/intro.htm
I am not looking for unbelieveable claims of lots of gas mileage or
power, they seem a bit too good...
Does anyone have experiences with these carbs? It seems as if they don't
require jets to tune, and are supposedly more efficient.
This might be an alternative to Solexes, although most of my problems
are probably due to my ignorance and lack of tons of bodies, parts, or
decent bushed lower halves of the solex units.
