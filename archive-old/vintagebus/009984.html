Good grief!!!

I can't wait to see what they come up with in a &quot;camper&quot; version.

Somehow, I just don't visualize this rig making a run to the dump on
Saturday morning.....

&gt;&gt;  The Microbus offers 3 rows of seats.  The middle centre seats can be
turned through 180 degrees and the third row has been deigned as a seat
bench.  All passengers have the protection of an integral seat belt.
Intelligent features such as these are characteristic of many features in
the interior.

The Microbus can be transformed into a veritable car cinema:  The
appropriate visual images are
provided by a 7&quot; screen in the centre console, four monitors in the
backrests of the first and second rows as well as two extendable displays
between the second and third rows.

A second 7 inch screen, located towards the front of the roof area, provides
a view of what is behind the Microbus.  The picture is provided by a
so-called backeye camera.  Along with both the exterior mirrors, this
provides a comprehensive view of what is behind the vehicle.  &lt;&lt;
