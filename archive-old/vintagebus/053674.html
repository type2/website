Josh,

You almost certainly have a virus. One of the stigmata of recent 
email viruses is that they include text from random files on your 
drive when they propogate.

Please don't go on line anymore until you've checked your 
machine with current anti-virus software and scrubbed it 
(preferably, format your drive and start over).

None of this has much to do with the vintagebus list.

&gt; im still here.  i had this happen to me from somebody else on 
the list.  im
&gt; not intentionally spamming anybody.  so dont be so quick to 
jump the gun.
&gt; if this has happened to anybody else from me, let me know and 
ill change
&gt; from outlook express to a hotmail account to prevent it from 
happening
&gt; again.  my apologies to anyone else this has happened to.
