&gt; I have been running a power pulley on my Baja for many years with no
&gt; problems.  Everybody seems to think it is wrong to use one on the street,
&gt; but the early Porsches used a pulley about this size.
&gt;
&gt; The temp seems to stay the same with the power pulley and I get a little
&gt; extra horsepower at the wheels.
&gt;

Not sure of where your at but in a very hot climate, for example here in Texas
where the temps often get 100+, I wouldnt run a power pully on a daily
driver.... let me rephrase that.... I &quot;cant &quot; run one...

The rail ran so hot, it would start losing power.... The B*g would start
pinging &amp; giving off that &quot;hot smell&quot;.... as far as runnin one on a T2...
definitly not... thats alot of weight for a little 40 horser to be pushing
around, it needs all the cooling it can get...
But on the other hand if you live in a place that rarely gets up to 50 or 60
degrees... Well .. you get the point:)
just my 2 cents worth...
