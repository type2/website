Subject: Fuel Pump Gasket

Hey I was wondering if you could help with out with some trouble I am having 
with my '67 bus.
After having some trouble with the engine, I was checking the fuel pump to 
make sure the screen inside of it was not clogged. I removed it and in the 
process broke the gasket. I was hoping that it would still work, but 
surprise surprise it does, and I am leaking fuel where the cap piece meets 
the body. I called Bus Boys and BFY Obsolete, and they suggested getting a 
fuel pump rebuild kit, or make a gasket on my own. Since neither of them had 
a rebuild kit, I am kinda stuck. So what I am wondering is if anyone knows 
where to get a fuel pump rebuild kit that would have the gasket I need, or 
has any suggestions on making a gasket, or any hints to a quick quality fix.
Thanks
Ben Eilerman
