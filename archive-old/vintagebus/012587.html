&gt;we found the muir book a little confusing on this subject.  any

&gt;appreciated

In unsolicited defense of John's book; please read the first page on
chapter one, how to use this book PROCEDURE ON HOW TO RUN PROCEDURES.
 step #4 in the current edition says DON'T IMPROVISE it said in earlier
editions  DON'T THINK (all caps not mine)

after the GOOD LUCK! heading it says

&quot;P.S. The procedures in this book may read like gibberish in the living
room in front of the fire but will come clear as you work directly with
the hardware, the tools in your hand.&quot;

do exactly what the book says.
you don't have to understand the mechanics
the only thing you need to understand is english.

when i first did end play i was adding and subtracting and syphering and
doing flipflops until i just did it.

&gt;suggestions and must-do while the engines out would be greatly
&gt;appreciated

is every thing good and clean in front of the clutch ? or is your rear
trans seal gong away? how about your throw out bearing and clutch forks?
is your starter pilot hole /bearing ovaled? uh how is your starter your
ring gear and starter pinion gear?
i blush at all these personal questions....
set were your engine was.
 look around the engine bay, anything catch your eye?
 this must sound funny coming from a Bible student but, be the bus, zen
it out...
 what would you do if you were the bus were would you crack, arc, spark,
sag or seize? look at that gas tank (if you have a early bus)is the
reserve petcock dripping
how is your sheet metal? somebody stop me.
