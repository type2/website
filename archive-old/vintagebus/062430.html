&gt; Hmm... ok, well, the tranny works just fine, goes into all the gears and 
&gt; such but it leaks like a m.f.  Will he need special tools to fix that?

Hi Diana,  
It depends on where it is leaking and why!

  um, obviously if i could afford a rebuilt tranny this problem would have 
been solved 
&gt; long ago.  But it's not an option.  So, I guess I need to tell him not to 
&gt; mess with the gears and such, just to put in new seals and gaskets?
&gt; 
That will might work, best you do the RGBs and axles yourself, but first you 
need to figure out where you have leakage.
