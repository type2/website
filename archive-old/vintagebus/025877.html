Thats my favorite foot stool.
Even better is on the dash with the safaris open. 
Tough to steer tho

Isaiah,

I thought I would mention that yes, your headlight buckets were worn through

from someone's feet.  This is a normal occurence for like 99% of the split

Buses I have seen.


It's funny, most Barndoors have the little foot rest on the passenger side

but people still put their foot on the headlight bucket.
