&lt;&lt; Bessie our 1967 Grateful Dead bus has come up with a howl. It starts at
 45MPH in 4th gear and at 50MPH it is the loudest, then starting at 55MPH it
 goes away--??
 3.88 tranny was done less then 6000 miles ago as well as rebuilding of the
 reduction boxes. Of course by two different people. Monday we will open up
 the reduction boxes and check the bearings. Hopefully it is the axle bearing
 in the boxes ? Otherwise it is open up time for the tranny again, bummer.
 Anyone out there that has had a similar 55MPH howl? and what was it? Noise
 the loudest at 50MPH and then stepping on the gas, and going up to 55MPH.
 No, it is Not wind noise. Hopefully, TWWM, uj

The tranny I used to have in my 61 was a $35 swap meet deal, bought  as a 
'good tranny', with new wheel cyls and shoes on it.
It had a howl around 50-55 in 4th.   Got gradually worse, until 25K later , 
the shifting into 2nd was crunchy and a bad noise had appeared in a reduction 
box.    Got it rebuildt.  Still thought it a good deal at the price.  Sounds 
like your noise is in the center section to me.  
    Just curious who rebuildt it.  Warranty?   Tell us what happens?
ps Bugster has had a quiet but audible whine /howl around 45-50 in 4th for 
the past 60,000 miles.  not bad enough to swap out the tranny.
