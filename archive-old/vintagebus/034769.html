Hi Steve,
Our 52 sunroof split window has tar painted in all the wheel wells and under 
the pan.  Now almost 50 years later the tar is cracking off in places due to 
being applied to thickly.  The factory Bahama Brown (A Hershey choclate 
color) now showing from under this tar layer looks like it was just sprayed 
on last week!      Eric&amp;Barb
