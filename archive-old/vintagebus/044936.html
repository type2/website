Subject: RE: [VB] Converting 6 volt to 12 volt  
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,
When using a voltage drop one really should check how much the voltage was 
dropped!  We use a voltmeter to check this and more often than not have had 
to use two voltage drops in line to do the job.  Otherwise the 6 volt wiper 
motor wears out all too soon due to the extra voltage and resulting stresses.
