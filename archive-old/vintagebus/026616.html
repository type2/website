I do not have safari's but the antenna I put on my 64 would work. It mounts on
the pass. side window pillar,
and has two mounting points.The antanna is offset from the mounts by about an
inch.I really like this spot as it is out of the way and does not detract from
the face! I just couldn't get myself to drill the face!

&gt; I've seen two safari antenna solutions: one way is an antenna with 2 90
&gt; degree bends, mounted on the side in the stock location.  The other is the
&gt; twin-post antenna mounted over the emblem  in the center.
&gt;
&gt; I intend to put safaris on the '55 some day, so I mounted a barndoor-style
&gt; antenna right at the base of the windshield frame.

&gt; &gt;customer service and what everyone says it to be.  But anyway, on a 67 bus
&gt; &gt;with safaris what kind of antanna was used and where was it placed?  If I am
&gt; &gt;going out on a limb financially for the safaris themselves i just have to
&gt; &gt;make sure that I have everything right!
