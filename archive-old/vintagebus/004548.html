Your points are well taken.

I based my comments on my experience with the Great Race in past years when
they started in Tacoma.  At both of those starts there were ordinary sedans,
etc., of '60s and '70s vintage entered in the non-competitive &quot;Tour&quot;
section, including vehicles/teams that had come from Europe just to
participate. and numerous ordinary pre-1960 vehicles entered in the
Sportsman Division.

I've gone to the Great Race website and reviewed the rules and fees, and
it's clear they have tightened things up considerably.  Perhaps they found
themselves with more entries than they could handle logistically and
shuffled things around to make the entry more restrictive.

That's too bad.  I've twice run with the competitors as far as Ellensburg
after Tacoma starts, and it was just a whole lot of fun.  At every little
crossroads and community the whole population seemed to have turned out, and
it was like a movable carnival.....

&gt;&gt;  Hi Fred,
The $4,000.00 after discounts for private parties would still be a hunk of
money to put up for a chance to win the $250,000.00.  From what we see about
the rules the auto to be entered has to be a pre-1960 race car or
motorcycle,
all other cars must be pre-1951.  So it looks to us that one would have to
enter a 1950 BD or if you could get VW to release the 49 prototype to
you.....
