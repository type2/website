I sold a yellow/grey tent with the changing room with poles &amp; bag, tent bag, 
N.O.S.  W/ stakes, twine, stake bag.
EVERYTHING N.O.S. in MINT MINT MINT condition for cheaper than what thom paid 
for his tent.
But thoms got the gool red/white/green one.

&lt;&lt;For $1700, it beter come with a freakin' *bus* attached!

I paid $1000 for my tent, whichI felt was on the steep side, but
sometime I have more dollars than cents when it comes to bus stuff...

&gt; Yup, $1700 is a steep price -- UNLESS this is an extremely rare,
&gt; never-heard-of-before, &quot;Privy&quot;-style tent with a FLOOR.  A floor that is
&gt; undocumented in the literature.  That might be interesting.  I'd suspect
&gt; the plastic floor is a K-Mart tarp.
