&gt;This weekend I took a 4 hour trip in my bus with a 5 year old and
&gt;a 12 year old. After I yelled &quot;keep your hands and other body parts
&gt;to yourself&quot; for about the 90th time, I decided that I need to
&gt;purchase a 12 volt tv\vcr combo for these occasions.

Disclaimer: I am 30 years old and don't have kids.

&lt;rant&gt;
I think maybe your problem is not electrical.  From 1885, when cars
first existed, to about 1985-1990, when it became economical for
people to have a TV and VCR in their cars, kids took long trips in
cars without the benefit of video.  They took part in now-obscure
pastimes such as looking out the windows, playing &quot;I Spy&quot;, reading
road maps, coloring in coloring books, and even reading.  Now, I
see minivans with local tags, that appear to be carrying kids on
short trips in town, with the LCD deployed in the back seat.  WTF?
Just because you _can_ have the kids in front of the TV whenever
they're not sleeping or in school doesn't mean you _should_.
&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt;In the T2 library, found an article about hooking one of these up,
&gt;but the reading wasn't very user-friendly.

There are two that I know of; did you check both?
