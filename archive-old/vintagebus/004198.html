Roger that, I just went ahead and had a local paint store match the color
and I sprayed them myself after sanding and prepping and they looked pretty
nice even after four years. They still get scratches on them just from being
in the storage bag with the other poles. Unless you wanted to have
individually made bags for each pole there is no way to avoid this, spray
your poles and enjoy your tent, just my opinion.

&gt; It won't happen, and you'll wind up scratching the hell out of the
&gt; poles, and you'll wind up right back where you started.
&gt;
&gt; Go to an automotive paint supply with pole in hand and have them match
&gt; the paint, and spray them.
&gt;
&gt; It is one hell of allot less expensive and the results will be the same.
&gt;
&gt; Your going to mess the poles up one way or another, in storage, or in
&gt; putting them together, so why waste the funds?
