&gt;My friend is finishing up his single cab and needs some of the repro safari 
&gt;wiper shafts.

&gt;I talked to Rene who made them and he will not have any for a few months.

Here's a money saving tip. Get a cute 8mm wrench, put it on your keychain or ty-wrap it to your church-key. Use it to remove the wipers before you open the safari's. You won't have to find a one-eyed duck and drill a hole in the nose. 

Door &amp; gate screws?  There's gotta be a source from that Type 1 model we've heard about. Anybody confirm my suspicion?  Craig in Modesto has had SS versions that are close, but not VN close.
