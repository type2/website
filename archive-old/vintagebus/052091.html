&lt;&lt; i think its an urban legend, that the no3  cyl has  a retar in the lobe of 
the distributor !! &gt;&gt;

Hi Michel,
If so then VW started it.  The below between the lines from 1963-67 Workshop 
Manual VW Transporter Section E-9, Page 12:
_____________________________________________________________________
Note:
From 3rd August 1964 Chassi No. 115 000 001, Engine No. 8 788 071, all VW 
engines are fitted with modified distributors.  The breaker cam lobe which 
controls the firing point of No. 3 cylinder is offset 2 distributor shaft 
degrees in retarded direction.  

Important
The ignition timing may only be set when the piston of No. 1 cylinder is at 
top dead center on the firing stroke and the rotor arm pointing towards the 
mark on the edge of the distributor housing.  The firing point of No. 3 
cylinder is then 4 crankshaft degrees later than that of No. 1 cylinder.
____________________________________________________________________
Even using a earlier distributor it would be a good idea to check for a 
retarded #3 distributor lobe in case later parts were used to repair and on 
3AUG64 and later distributors it would be very wise to install a degree 
pulley and check for proper retard.  Especially since DPOs will often remove 
the bottom gear off the distributor and reset it 180 degrees out of alignment 
to solve a distributor drive gear installed 180 degrees out of whack!  Then 
when you install it in your engine with the distributor drive in it's proper 
alignment........

PS With the modified distributor lobes not only # 3 would run hot, but also 2 
&amp; 4 cylinders if the distributor is set to it's proper timing degrees.   EEE&amp;B
