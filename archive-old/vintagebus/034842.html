This article attempts tell how to use Stewart Warner gas heaters in
VWs.  Stewart Warner has been selling gas heaters for cars and planes
for over 60 years.  During the 60s and early 70s they were sold in
versions specifically tailored for VW Bugs and Buses.  Occasionally they
show up at swapmeets in numerous  incarnations and in various stages of
completeness.  If you are lucky enough to find one that fits your
vehicle you are all set.  This article is addressed to those not so
lucky.

First a few words on the joys of gas heater ownership.  They have a
number of advantages: They put out lots of heat.  The heat comes on
right now, no waiting for the engine to warm up.  You can have heat
without the engine running.  The temperature of the vehicle interior is
regulated, it doesn't go up and down as your bus goes over hill and
dale. They are mysterious, almost no one has experienced one
operational, nobody seems to know how they work and they all think they
are bombs just waiting for ignition.  Actually, while they are very
effective, they are pretty pedestrian. No more complex and working on
the same principle as home-heating oil burners.  A small quantity of
gasoline from the car's tank is sprayed into an enclosed chamber along
with air from a blower.  The enclosed chamber has an exhaust outlet for
combustion products.  A second blower draws in fresh air over the
exterior of the sealed chamber, with the combustion inside,  and pushes
the heated air into the passenger compartment.  There is no physical
path between either the gasoline or the combustion products and the
passenger compartment.  Temperature control is achieved by turning the
spray of gasoline on and off under control of a thermostat located in
the heated air stream into the passenger compartment.
 
Typically gas heaters are located in the trunk of a Bug or in the engine
compartment of a bus.  One interesting exception is the engine &quot;heat
booster&quot; located under the car over the transmission, on some Type IV
models.  The &quot;heat booster&quot; takes warm air from the engine in the
conventional bug fashion and adds additional heat.  These Type IV
heaters are quite common and are manufactured for VW by Ebanspacher in
Germany.  Ebanspacher also makes a variety of conventional gas heaters
for vehicles, other than for the Type IV, however they are quite rare in
the USA.  They are common in Europe however and sometimes  show up on
VWs and Porsches imported by US servicemen. The only US vehicles that
came with Ebanspacher  heaters was the early 70s VW Thing.  None of the
Ebanspacher parts like spark plugs, combustion blowers, etc. are
compatible with Stewart Warner heaters.  Two exceptions are the
electronic temperature controller and the ignition coil. The temperature
controller esthetically matches the other switches in Bugs and is
technically a very slick piece.  Much more sophisticated than the simple
flex cable operated bi-metal switch used in the Corvair heaters.

The best source for Stewart Warner heaters suitable for use in the VW is
early 60s Corvairs on which they were standard equipment.  The heaters
are located in the trunk on the right side and are easy to find in junk
yards for low bux.  A Corvair installation consists of three
assemblies.  The main heater, the combustion blower and the temperature
control unit located in the passenger compartment. The cable operated
temperature control unit is the upper left unit in the picture
corvair.jpg.  The components are all wired together so the pieces are
easy to find.  Expect to pay about $20 for the whole thing.  One
additional item required to use the Corvair heater as-is is an electric
fuel pump.  The best source for these is from a rotary powered Mazda. 
This pump is a 12 volt electronic type usually located on the right side
of the trunk under the mat.

For a bus installation the stock Corvair unit is not too bad just as it
comes out of  the donor car.  Just hook the fuel pump power lead to the
12 volt side of the ignition coil.  The original Corvair installation
used the engine fuel pump to provide fuel for the heater.  This scheme
could be used on a bus also but that will eliminate the possibility of
enjoying heat with the engine off.  Note that most fuel injection pumps
provide too much pressure.  About 5 PSI from a typical  pump designed
for use with carbs is about right.

The hot ticket (pun intended) is to use the  electronic temperature
controller and thermistor from the Ebanspacher heater used in the Type
IV.  The temperature controller is easy to find, it is behind the knob
with the green center and heat symbol on it, mounted on the dash of a
411.  Remove it and the connector with about 6 inches of wire.  It is
the small white box above the combustion blower in the picture
corvair.jpg.  The thermistor that is the temperature sensor for the
temperature controller is a bit more difficult to locate.  It is located
in the heater unit under the car. It has two wires connected to it and
is held in place with a clamp that can be loosened with a single screw. 
Its white plastic base is about 1 inch in diameter and once removed you
can see the thermistor inside a small protective cage.  Rescue it and
about 6 inches of its associated wires.

The way it works is that the thermistor is mounted somewhere in a duct
that carries the hot air coming out of the heater.  Where the most
convenient place is will depend on the ducting arrangement in the
installation. The thermistor connects to the temperature controller. 
Also connected to the temperature controller is battery power and
vehicle ground.  The output of the temperature controller goes to a
relay that switches power to the ignition coil, fuel pump and fuel
control solenoid.  The fuel control solenoid is the cad plated can on
one end of the combustion chamber. It has one or two Fast-On terminals
on it.  The insulated terminal is hot and the one connected to the round
metal cover is ground.  When the control knob clicks in the extreme
counter-clockwise direction everything is off.  Turning the knob
clockwise will first turn the fresh air blower on and the center of the
knob will illuminate to indicate that the heater is on.  At some point
of advancing the knob in the clockwise direction the heater will turn
on.  The heater will cycle around this temperature. If the knob is
advanced the heater will cycle about a higher interior vehicle
temperature.

A Stewart Warner heater with Ebenspacher controller wiring diagram
(wiring.jpg) is attached. None of the wiring is critical since the
currents are modest. The two relays I used are the Bosch types that look
like a 1 inch cube and are plentiful in dead Rabbits. The whole system
is fused with an 8 Amp fuse.

A couple of points related to safety are important. The bi-metal switch
located in a ceramic block on the side of the heater is a safety device
that prevents overheating that would accompany a loss of fresh air.  If
the main chamber is in danger of overheating the thermal switch opens
and interrupts power to the fuel solenoid.  Be sure to connect this
device. The exhaust from the heater must be led to a point where it can
never, never be drawn back into the fresh air intake for the heater. 
This is not too hard to accomplish if the car is moving but may be very
hard to do if the heater is operated in a vehicle that is stationary,
like waiting at a traffic light. This point cannot be overemphasized,
the gas chamber is for bad guys.  The exhaust pipe I used for my heater
was flexible stainless steel tube 1 ¼ inches in diameter obtained from
J.C. Whitney.  The tube is fastened to the heater outlet by brazing the
last inch from the lower pipe outlet on a bug muffler to the end of the
flex and securing it using the packing and clamp from the Bug exhaust .
This pipe outlets at a point just ahead of the right rear tire.  There
is a small rubber drain tube in the bottom of the combustion chamber. 
In any installation make sure the drain remains on the bottom and that
it exits outside the vehicle.  Its function is to drain out fuel that
would accumulate if the system were operated with a failed ignition
system.   Another interesting point is that the heater will have a
difficult time blowing warm air into a Bug if you don't leave a place
for the cool air to escape.  Crack a wind wing when the heater is on.

The air coming out of a gas heater is pretty hot.  The ducting I use for
both the heating air blower (2 ½ inch ID) and the combustion air blower
(1 ¼ inch ID) is silicone impregnated fiber glass.  This is the same
stuff often used for Bug heater ducts.  It can be seen in the picture
Bajaheat.jpg.

A couple of notes on my particular installation.  An additional
advantage of the gas heater for me was the transfer of weight away from
the rear of the car, by eliminating the very heavy exhaust-to-air heat
exchangers, to the front of the car.  I also replaced the large Stewart
Warner 12 volt coil with the much smaller one from an Ebenspacher unit.

The function of this article is not to provide a step-by-step
instruction manual for a heater installation but rather as an
inspiration for others to enjoy the benefits of these nifty devices. 
With the exception of the electrical stuff most everything else can be
figured out by inspection. I have provided a few pictures for
identifying components and showing the installation in my Baja Bug.
Bajaheat.jpg, interior.jpg, &amp; corvair.jpg.  Also included is a wiring
diagram (diagram.jpg) for a system using a 411 controller with a SW
heater.  Several articles on gas heaters have appeared in DB&amp; HVWs
magazine over the years.  Has a worthwhile article and the 4-83 and 7-83
issues have letters covering conversion of 6 volt units to 12 volts.  I
would be glad to answer any questions regarding the operation or
installation of gas heaters in VWs.  e.schumacher_at_worldnet.att_dot_net
