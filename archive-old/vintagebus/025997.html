Subject: Horn workings
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 132.233.247.6

I picked up a screw-terminal horn off eBay a little while ago so last weekend I hooked it up.  Damn, it doesn't work.  So, I took it apart.  The internals appeared mint except for what looked like points seemed to be dirty.  Cleaned those up, oooh, it works now.

As I examined the internals of the horn to determine how it actually works, I came up with the following:
1. The electricity creates an electro magnet that draws the horn diaphram down.
2. When the diaphram is pulled down suddenly, it opens the horn &quot;points.&quot;
3. This interrupts the horn electrical circuit and releases the diaphram back upward
4. The &quot;points&quot; then close and the cycle repeats.

Is this right?  What I couldn't really figure out was what was causing the points to open, I didn't see anything that would push on them.  They were under a lot more tension then the points in a distributor...  

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
