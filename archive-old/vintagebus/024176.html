&lt;&lt; Well, if you saw the sorry shape this poor lunchwagen is in, you'd 
understand.
 What's more important - that the survival of the &quot;authenticity&quot; of the car, 
or 
 the survival of the car itself? &gt;&gt;

I would definitely say the vehicle itself. Why dont people get excited about 
fake 356's, or why aren't people buying those fiberglass noses for the front 
of baywindows, and everyone pretty much feels the same about reproduction 
parts. Its all about the real deal.
