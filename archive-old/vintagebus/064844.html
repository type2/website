Just wanted to let everyone know that Buses and Punkin Chunkin 2002 is still on.

I have been very busy at work and haven`t had much spare time to organize things.

Heres the info: Buses And Punkin Chunkin in the First State, when: Nov. 1st-3rd where: Holly Lakes Campground rt. 24 Millsboro,Delaware (302)945-3410 or (800)227-7170 Website hollylakecampsites_dot_com/  The camping is little pricey at 35.00 a night but it is the only campground close to the event thats still open. We have had a great time in the past with just over 20 buses last year. Check out my website for pics.http://pages.prodigy_dot_net/bugnut1/

There is no need to make reservations unless you feel the need. Contact me for more info: bugnut1_at_prodigy_dot_net
