Hello Craig and list,

Interesting.  my bus also has M361. It is a flipseat camper, so it is a 
swivel seat model (M199, M192).  No sliding door, I hadn't heard of that one 
before.  Who knows if it had chrome hubcabs, by the time the poor bus got to 
me, it had hacked wheel wells and baja tires.  It seems strange that a DC 
would have 361.

wait a minute, just did a search on Thom's bus registry.  10 busses show up 
with M361, and ALL of them are DC's except mine.  Now I'm really confused as 
to what 361 means. Hmmm....

&gt;
&gt;OK I finally ran my Double Cab on Thoms site and am still confused by the 
&gt;first M-Code on my 60 Double Cab. I looked the numbers up a while back in 
&gt;one of the bus books and came up with the similar info. The first number is 
&gt;361. This is a combination of M169 - Sliding door types 231-238, M181 - 
&gt;Chrome hub caps, M192 - body ready to be outfitted as a camper, M199 - 
&gt;Drivers seat as swivel seat types 211
&gt;213 214 and camping car. This makes no sense to me. Can anyone shed some 
&gt;light on this?
&gt;The complete tag is as follows:
&gt;15 12 9
&gt;361 017 176 207
&gt;UA 265 Grey    the Vin is 547 523
&gt;thanks,
