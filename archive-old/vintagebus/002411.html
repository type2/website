Just a reminder that the VW Super Jam is at Maple Grove Raceway, Pa. a week
&gt;from this Sunday, on June 13. This is one of the area's largest shows. It's
about an hour from Philly or Allentown, 15 minutes from Reading, not far
&gt;from the Morgantown exit of the Pa. Turnpike.

This may be the only show I'll be set up at this year, due to lack of time.
(Living only 1/2 hour or so away, I'd have no excuse for missing this one!
:-)  If everything goes as planned, my stand will be very centrally located.
When you walk through the gate to get in, you walk down a short isle with
vendors on both sides, then immediately hit a &quot;T&quot; where you can either go
left to the show or right to the flea market. Last year I was smack at the
top of that &quot;T&quot; so if you kept going straight instead of turning you'd walk
right into me.  I hope to have the same spot this year. In any case, I'll
have a big yellow banner up, and should be hard to miss.  In years past,
list members have picked a meeting time and used my stand as a landmark for
any interested list members to meet at the show.

If anyone would like me to bring specific parts to the show for them, let me
know as soon as possible so I can make sure they're here on time.  If it's
rubber or a relatively obscure part you need, you may even want to call me
today (215-234-VWVW) since some of my orders for those type of parts are
going in this afternoon.  If what you need is more standard auto-parts fare,
you can just order it via the website (or call) since most of those items I
can get on a couple days notice if I don't stock them already.

For those interested in camping, French Creek State Park is not far away.
(Be warned, by the way, that they enforce the &quot;no alcohol&quot; laws there, as
attendees of a Vanagon list get-together a couple of years ago can attest.)
There is also a private campground right nearby, although I don't recall the
name.  Directions can be found at http://www.maplegroveraceway_dot_com .

This show is always quite large and well worth attending.  Hope to see many
of you there, and perhaps meet some of you face-to-face for the first time!
