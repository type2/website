&lt;&lt; What is up with VW?  They're gonna be selling a Jetta station wagon
 here in the states and with a 2L!  Instead of the 1.8T that everyone
 wants.  Their Eurovan is a gas guzzler when compared to other vans. 
 And the worst thing is this Eurovan does not have manual transmission,
 with only one engine option.  They don't even have a no frills car be
 it a golf or a new beetle to be no frills or whatever.  Honestly I
 wouldn't mind a Eurovan, but as long as manual is unavailable...   I'd
 never be caught dead driving an automatic (unless it wassn't my car). 
 And why oh why did they discontinue the Vanagon?  It looks like the
 Eurovan is even smaller.  The NB is too close to the ground.  Both the
 NB and the Eurovan don't have the syncro.  Oh gosh, if you have seen
 their futur passat you would know what I'm talking about.  Honestly
 the new Passat looks alright but the tail lights are terrible.  They
 made the tail lights look like the car is a d*mn rice burner.
 Overall I think VW is doing a good job and their NB is a big hit. 
 Just my 2 cents
