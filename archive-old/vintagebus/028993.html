Dan,

Having just gone through this exact problem with a 1600 DP I did a top end
rebuild on I know your pain!  With much help from Kyle here on the list I traced
my overheating problem to intake leaks between the end castings and the heads.
I originally used the metal crush gaskets that come in the German  gasket kit.
These are woefully inadequate at sealing.  I went and got proper asbestos
gaskets and used copper gasket spray.  I also sealed up any extra holes, left in
my fan housing, by my absent flaps with tape.  I also changed both pressure
valves and springs just for good measure.

These two things cut my temps from 250 to about 190-210 on the fwy at 60 mph.  I
know you said you checked for leaks, but if you're using the metal gaskets, its
easy to change while you have everything out and off.
