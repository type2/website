Subject: new bus questions

wazzup bus peeps

i got some questions about my new bus. i gots it last week from a junkyard in town.the homie at the yards says itsa 61 but im not sure. i looked by the windshield but cant find the vin number like my moms car.i wanna know how to lower it. i saw a sick bus yeasterday and man that bus was slammed!  i want to put some bags on it.

my bro down the street has a moter hes gonna sell to me.says its a 1640 and will work perfect. its alredy got all the crome metal and pipes.is this a bus motor?

i live close to la and want to know where to get parts and rims for it.  it runs right now but runs real bad and its real slow.how do find out what year it is?
