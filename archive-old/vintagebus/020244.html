Surfer Bob Davis asked:
Ellis, what's that clinic you admitted yourself to
after the '67 RFH was finished????

Answer: I asked an aquaintance of mine, Charlie
Hamill, the same question when I was at the stage
where you currently find yourself. Charlie &quot;the Dude&quot;
Hamill told me that he has never finished a
restoration. To clarify, he indicated that there is
always something else that you can do to them to make
them &quot;just right&quot;. It goes on forever if you let it.

I concur with &quot;the Dude&quot; by saying that past a point
you drive them and enjoy them. With 50,000 miles and
five years already on the Resto from Hell I could
easily tear it all down and redo everything. Paint,
front suspension, interior and many more aspects of
our bus are in major need of attention if we really
cared. At this point we just use it for camping. The
plaques now help level the Puck. ;-)

The more you scrutinize, is in proportion to the
degree that you will exponentially see the flaws
multiply right before your eyes. You'll be amazed that
even the toughest critics will not see the flaws that
you know exist. Don't scrimp on the details that have
gotten you to this point just to get the thing
&quot;finished&quot;. Persevere to the end. Past that point
enjoy and use the beast! =)

I suspect that your bus will in fact be &quot;the Sh**&quot; of
the season. Congrats and good luck!

Davis also wrote: Don't quote me on this, but I will
never restore another vehicle for as long as I live!!!
 Especially a camper.  Jeez what a PITA

Ellis responds with a hearty laugh. I have heard that
said more than once. My cure was to do a '63 EZ camper
as a rolling resto. Tried to do that on the cheap as
an attempt to get back to my beater bus roots. Now
THAT was a real PITA as it was my only driver! Ended
up redoing every system until it was all good the way
it originally should have been done. That bus ended up
being even more dependable than the RFH. A friend in
SD now owns it. My temporary cure is an F150 with A/C.

Give it up, we are all junkies!
