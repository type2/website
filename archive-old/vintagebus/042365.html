Subject: rebuilding 63 and older brake cylinders...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10001271242170.53564-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

i have that 61 i just wrote about and think itll need a brake overhaul..

Since i have a 67 front beam and tranny i plan on putting in, i just want
to get the small nut stuff going to test the bus out and see if i like
small nut okay, or if i really need to update... Eventually i will put in
all new cyl, but i dont want to test it out at a cost of $120+ (if my cyl
are unrebuildable ill probably go ahead and update now bc of the cost of
brake parts, i can &quot;rebuild&quot; the entire 67 front beam for about the cost
of  just the cylinders for the 61 beam.)

the only brake rebuild kit i have been able to find is pn 211 698 411.
Busdepot lists this as being 60-70. Since 55-60 brakes are the same this
confused me.

I figure this kit will work as the older stuff is 24.5mm and the newer
brakes are 25mm, not much of a difference, so the rebuild kit is
probably the same parts for both. but i wanted to make sure that
i was getting the right thing...

any advice?

thanks,

Steve
