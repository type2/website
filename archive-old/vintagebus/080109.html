Subject: Last Call for JBB Carabus

Hi Volks,

This is LAST CALL for entries to the carabus heading down to John 
Brown's Buses in Harper's Ferry West Virginia!!!

We'll be meeting at the gate of Lake Erie State Park at 8:30 and 
departing at 9AM Sharp. We'll take Rt.5 West to 79 South and stop at 
the first rest stop south of Pittsburgh for a lunch break where we'll 
meet with Frank from Ohio. We'll continue South to I-68 East to I-70 
and South on I-81.

If you're interested in tagging along, please let me know. Bring a CB 
radio if possible, we'll be using channel 14 as the &quot;Hailing 
Frequency&quot;. Or email me for our designated carabus cell-phone number.

The weather reports tell me it's gonna be a VWonderful weekend.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
