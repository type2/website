I'm just about ready to pull the transaxle, that I mentioned a couple weeks
ago (replacing front mount, shifting coupler and checking nose cone). Been
soaking the spring plate bolts and carrier bolts and hoping they will come out
with minimum trauma (to me and the hardware). I pulled the gas tank which has
a hump in the center rear half. Is this from a '67? It has a one peice filler
neck that looks like it has been seeping and also some seepage around the
outlet fitting. I'm thinking about replacing the tank with stock and I want to
install a reserve valve. I have had no trash in this tank, my fuel filter at
the tank has remained clean. Currently have a 1600 dual port getting about 22
mph. Does anybody know where a new tank can be obtained, and do you think it
is a good idea to go back to stock?
