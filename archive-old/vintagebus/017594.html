Subject: old headliner adhesive removal?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey.
The inside of my 67 21 window is stripped. There is
the old, brown headliner glue all around the window
frames and above.
I want to remove this stuff so I can at least have
white metal there until I redo the interior.
Is there a good adhesive dissolver that will leave the
paint alone? I tried some orange stuff but it still
took some serious rubbing.

Or, is there some benefit to leaving the old glue
there?

Just thought I'd ask the list before I give the FLAPS
my hard earned $$

Jason
