was writ:


&gt;to see your motors are running too hot, take them on a nice test ride in the
heat of the sun. then park, and grab the dipstick. If you can hold dipstick
handle without sustaining burns, you're okay. If you can't grab and hold the
dipstick, start looking for a source of overheating.&lt;

OK, this isn't the first time I've seen this. Who decided that grabbing
the dipstick is a measure of how hot or cold your engine is running? The
dipstick is under a foot long, is immersed in hot oil, and is only a
couple of inches away from the number two cylinder (ok I know it's
behind the tin). On top of that it's an aircooled engine pushing a big
box down the road. I think the dipstick is indeed going to be pretty
hot, right? I'm sorry, it doesn't seem like a very scientific or
reliable way to tell if your engine is happy or not.

I've tried this test and when the ambient temps are 65 and below the
test works fine, however when it gets a little warm, so does the
dipstick. In the summer I don't touch the sucker until after I'm done
fueling up, then I can check the oil level.

Maybe when I bend over to check the engine I should face the east and
chant a mantra or hire a Shaman to chase away the evil spirits before I
grab the dipstick.

well, if the dipstick is hotter when it is hotter outside, that makes sense
huh?    If you want a specific number, get a guage and sender.

I also use the &quot;spit test&quot;.   Yes very ladylike and all.   If I feel the
motor is too warm I spit on the case.  If the spit sizzles a bit, that must
be close to  212 F.  If it instantly sizzles to mist, we are running too hot.
  If it doesn't sizzle at all,  it is not too hot.   I think it is
scientific.  Been doing this for years.    An ex boyfriend of mine hated it
when I spat on the motor.   Aren't people weird?
