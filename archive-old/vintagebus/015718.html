&gt; Anyone know of a source for a parts manual?  I know where to find the Bently
&gt; Workshop Manual, but I am looking for a comprehensive parts manual.
&gt; (owner's manual would be nice too)

I am slowly but surely putting one online along with whatever else I can collect.  I've been privately miffed about not finding them for years, and when I see xeroxes sold on eBay for $50+, and originals for generally exorbitant amounts...I figured &quot;what the heck&quot; and started scanning.

I am actually out of state right now, but I'll be scanning again when I get back.
