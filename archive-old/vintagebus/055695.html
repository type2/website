 Could they???

I think they could, if they had in writing what the bus was supposed to be,  
and clear representation documented that it was not (from mechanic or 
bodyshop).  And quotes of how much it would cost to get the bus to the 
sellers stated condition.    

A few years ago someone I knew bought a split window rag top bug from out of 
state.  Sight unseen.  It had been featured in one of the rags, the sellers 
description and picture were great.    But innacurate.  Upon arrival, the 
engine didn't run right, there was something wrong with the tranny (both 
supposedly rebuilt).  supposedly  NOS parts were plastic repros (of taillight 
housings) or obviously aged pieces.  

He was making a long list- pages - of what was not as described on the bug.  
I am not sure where it progressed from there, but seeing as part of the 
payment was due after he got the car, he did not send that part of the 
payment.  I wondered when he was spending over 10K on a 'fully restored' 
split bug why he didn't spend a few bucks and a weekend to fly and see it 
first.  Also realise the mags will print what they are told about the 
featured car.   The engine may be a POS under that shiny tin.  etc.  so what 
if the slots in the engine tin screws all line up.

Whether they should depends on the amount spent and the amount needed to fix 
what was misrepresented.
