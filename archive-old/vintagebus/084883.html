&gt; Problem with this is that ever since braided hose became &quot;kewl&quot; we have
&gt; been flooded with braided hose that is basically junk.  I prefer a good
&gt; rubber hose made by a reputable manufacturer like Gates.

For way more than you ever wanted to know about things like this, read
&quot;Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners and Plumbing Handbook&quot;
(Motorbooks International, 1990, ISBN 0-87938-406-9), about US$20-$25.
In brief, he used reputable makes of stainless braided hose for critical
race-car applications, but for less critical race-car stuff and all
street-car stuff, he used reputable makes of rubber hoses, barb-type end
fittings, and hose clamps.  This book was written 16 years ago and Smith
complained about the junk braided hose on the market even then.

Smith was an engineer/mechanic/crew chief for lots of different race
teams, including the Shelby GT40.  He wrote some other good books with
titles in the &quot;$foo To Win&quot; pattern: &quot;Drive to Win&quot;, &quot;Tune to Win&quot;, etc.
Allegedly he wanted to call the hardware book &quot;Screw to Win&quot; but the
publisher balked.
