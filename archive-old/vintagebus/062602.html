Subject: pulley ratio

i checked my crank/gen. pulley ratio this morning and it was only at 1.6:1.  
i had on it a fan belt from napa and an aftermarket degree pulley, so i put 
on my new continental spare belt and the correct &quot;D&quot; stamped pulley and my 
ratio is now at 1.8:1.  my question is, what else could i do to get the 2:1 
ratio that im supposed to have?  thanks!
joshua
