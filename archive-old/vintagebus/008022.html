hmm for a while now, I have been kickin around the idea of a type2 only
magazine..of course costs and so forth have made me shy away and I didn't
know just how much interest that would generate to break even.  Then I
thought of another option. The online magazine. I don't know if some of you
have seen http://www.vwmagazine_dot_com/ (Brocks magazine online). Of course
that's mainly type 1's. Would this be something anyone would be interested
in for type2's? I would gladly post ANY event coverage and any articles or
feature vehicles anyone sent in (type 2 only). I'm leaning towards vintage
and 60's. No printing costs, subscription rates, or anything. Just stuff the
type2 ppl want to see. Rarest of the rare, featured buses, readers projects,
etc. I have been saving tech posts from the last year and they are all
placed neatly in folders on my hard drive, so getting tech articles would
not be a prob :)(authors permission of course).... how bout FUBU TYPE2
(foo-boo, for us by us)? :)  or &quot;TYPE2, the daily driver&quot;... just a
suggestion.  The name is the least of the worries of course. Lemme know if
anyone would like to see a T2 mag on the net, or if paper is your pleasure.
Maybe I could do a trial run issue and see if anyone takes a liking to it.
