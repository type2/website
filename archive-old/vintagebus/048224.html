Thanks to those who helped out in contacting someone by giving numbers and 
such!
I got the number for the Crazy Horse Campgrounds and we (chris and I) were 
able to get ahold of Ronnie.

&lt;&lt;Hi Dan
I remember Ronnie Posting a message about a trailer and a truck to tow
anyone in this situation,,&gt;&gt;

That seems to be the situation.  Going to put it to good use too!  Plans are 
to have it towed to the camp and see from there.

Thanks again!
