Subject: To buy or not to buy: '59 Double-door panel walk-through

I have always wanted a double door, (already passed on a '57 DD riviera and
have kicked myself multiple times for passing) and a friend of mine has a
'59 DD panel - no windows cut - of course needs some body sections replaced:
passenger rear corner up to the belt line (PO's really bad attempt), the
front steps and dogleg area, and of course a few little sections of the sill
are all the way through. Also, it appears they either cut to put '67 front
turn signals in, or replaced the nose. However, the bus was parked in '84 -
and was only driven around the block when my friend got the bus.

The dash is totally original - but the ashtray is really rusted out - kinda
weird as its JUST the ashtray. Also, since the bus is a walk-through - I
have never seen one of these - are these really that rare?

BTW I am not worried about the rust replacement, I know i can do that if i
take my time, and of course the mechanical, I am not worried about, but I
would also want to put a bed in the back, and not sure if this would be the
bus for me, especially if I would devalue the bus at all if I was to put
camper interior in it......opinions?
