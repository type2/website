The outside dimensions are the same, but the wall thickness of the aluminum
case is greater than the factory OEM. But most of this chat is supposition, I
guess you have to own one or know someone who does to really know.

&gt; I think what you are looking for is conductivity.  Alloys close to the VW
&gt; case material have conductivities of about 90W/m K  Aluminum is around
&gt; 200W/m K, while steel is 40W/m K, so magnesium alloy is about half as good
&gt; as aluminum at conducting heat, gut twice as good as steel.
&gt;
&gt; However, you must also consider the thickness of the metal.  You can make
&gt; steel parts much thinner than you can aluminum or magnesium parts, so you
&gt; gain conductivity there.

considering the aluminum casting is very similar to the original this
would pretty much put the notion that an aluminum case will cause the oil
temps to be 15-30 degrees hotter in questionable light.
