Please a note below that I received to my web site.  Contact her, not me,
please follow her phone call wishes.  I told her where to find the VIN# so
hopefully a title is in the works...  :)

Carpe diem!

Hello,hope you are doing well.I have in my garage what I believe to be a
1960 kombi,which was dug out of a barn about five years ago.It had an
assortment of stuff stored in it,including about 50 pairs of old shoes,in
shoeboxes.It also had racoons living in it.I brought it home and have had
it sitting in the garage since then.I had planned on working on it
eventually but never found the time.It does need some work on it but, there
is more than enough to restore it back to originality.I don't have a title
for it yet because I haven't been able to get in to where I can see the vin
#.On a model that old there is nothing in the windshield.I would like to
find it a good home if possible.Cash is not imperstive.Maybe something in
trade. I'm located in Lorain,Ohio which is about thirty miles west of
Cleveland on the beautiful shores of polluted Lake Erie.Phone # is
(1-440-277-7699)or(1-440-277-8687) if you wish to call.Evenings during the
week are probably the best time......Perk
