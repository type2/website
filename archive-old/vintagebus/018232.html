 Could it be that the lower hardboard in
&gt; the cargo area had the
&gt; same material as the upper portion of the rest of
&gt; the door panels?  This
&gt; would mean that it would also get the trim beading
&gt; stapled to the top of the panel.  Anyone????  

If you're talking about the (approx.) 3 foot long, 10&quot;
high panels beneath the windows (non-walk through, so
no spare tire back there), yes, same material as the
top of the door panels (at least it's so on my mesh
grey interior) no beading stapled to the top, though.
The hatch panel is also same as top of door panels, no
beading. and instead of the screws with washers it has
the chrome pop-in buttons on the hatch. Although this
hatch has no holes for deluxe trim. Standard Micro?
It's a PO installed donor interior.
