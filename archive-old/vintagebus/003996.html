&lt;Bob Hoover should withdraw entirely and
&lt;be shed of the lot of us.

Agreed. Although I enjoyed the Sermons immensely, as much for reading as for
technical info, I cannot see why anyone would tolerate this kind of abuse
for providing a free service at the expense of his time. This abysmal
episode has been brought to you by the Dr. Spock child rearing method and
your public schools.....nicely done folks. Now that we have attended to the
important task of driving an enjoyable and worthwhile archive of information
off of the net, because someone got a rude e-mail, should we resume talking
about the repairing of pre-67 Volkswagen buses, or should we now shift our
under-occupied attention to self destructing the list? If common sense were
gasoline, some of us couldn't ride an ants' moped around the inside of a
Cheerio.
