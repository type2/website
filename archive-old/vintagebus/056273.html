Subject: Re[VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

well, only owning vw cars I guess any time I drive, it's in a vw.  Then
again, I only live 7 blocks from work so I usually rely on biped
transportation.  Accordingly, the tipper gets driven once a week, the 93 EV
is driven by the wife for groceries, and the NB is the airport commuter car.
In the summer, the ghia vert gets dusted off :-)   The kids like the tipper
and ghia best!
