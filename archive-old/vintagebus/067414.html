Subject: VWOA Elephant mirrors

A list member was kind enough to provide me with a pair of the original VWOA &quot;Elephant Ear&quot; mirrors. However, I am missing one mounting arm and both screws for the mirrors that mount them to the arm. These screws must be different as there is a bottom threaded portion and halfway up the thread goes into a square non-threaded area on the cast white metal mirror mounting pivot. If anybody has these as spares lying around their garage, drop me a line.....

Thanks in advance....
