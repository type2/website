Hi Steve,
I got one of those flyers.  Do you need me to fax it to you, or do you just
have a question about it that you could email to me.

Let me know.

&gt; &gt;One of the best Pomona's I ever had, why I don't know, could it have
&gt; been
&gt; &gt;the Westfailure drawing all the people over?
&gt;
&gt; It must have been me. When I left, you said you had'nt made a dime and
&gt; still owed Kyle 200 bucks. I'm good luck ;-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Man, and that's what you get for not being able to make it to every
&gt; show or
&gt; &gt;swap you want to.
&gt;
&gt; You never had a chance. Ronnie had the inside track on it and said he
&gt; almost trampled people to get it ;-) Besides, he bought it the night
&gt; before. Thats when all he good stuff gos. All the sellers prowl the rows
&gt; the night before and before first light. You can still do well if you
&gt; get there by 5am though.
&gt;
&gt; I spent every penny I brought....a first for me. Saw Ronnie and picked
&gt; up a set of main bearings to double check the ones I bought. I found a
&gt; few deals on new  parts for my motor. A brand new 30/31 for 70 bucks and
&gt; a new DH cooler for 40. I bought out a guys stock (all of 5) NOS small
&gt; hole heat riser gaskets for a buck. My big ticket item was metal 4 leg
&gt; rack for my double cab. One foot is damaged, but for $125 its a easy
&gt; fix.
&gt;
&gt; Hey, anyone pick up a flyer from the guy on the (East) end of a row who
&gt; was selling parts and was hawking a powder coating service. He is in
&gt; Hyland out in the San Berdoo area. His prices were great, but I lost the
&gt; flyer.
