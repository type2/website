Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Belly Pans!

Kelly Brown AKA Metwiz, there on his web site. Rich at Oldbuses_dot_com bought
out WCC's supply and might part with a set (I can't promise that as he is
working on at least 5 deluxes), Wolfgang has Schofields from England, or if
you are not in a hurry there are some perfect repo's on there way over from
the motherland (but I think they are really made in Denmark)


ronnie   all you have to do is ask

Subject: [VB] Re: Belly Pans!



	Does anyone have a source for belly pans I called West Coast
Classic today and they no longer have a set. The Belly Pans are going on
my 65 Deluxe and I would like them to be good quality. But I will take
what I can I need just the left and right pans not the one in the
center.


Thanks for your help
