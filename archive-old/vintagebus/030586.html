&gt;I put the filter between pump and carb, but have a longer piece of line
to loop around the coil.   So far, no problems. I dont like a filter when
it is not easy to see, or where it will pour gas on me when I chnange it.

&gt;
I don't like meltable plastic in my hot engine compartment, especially when
it's filled with gas, worse when it has pressure applied to it's fittings.

If I have to change the filter on the road, the gas will go on the ground,
instead of on my hot engine case.  Well, I'll just put my reserve tap in
the off position first so no gas spills.  :)
