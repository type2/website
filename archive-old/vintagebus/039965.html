Hey Al,

My 66 w/ 66 hatch had a 67 mechanism and latch installed.  All you have to 
do is pop your old hatch and take out the triangulated 3 boltes that hold 
the latching mechanism.  Also take the 1 srew out that holds the pushbutton 
lock cylinder to the mechanism and swap it out.  You will most likely have 
one srew hole below the cylinder on the 67 hatch, so make sure you weld that 
up first.  Your gonna be all good!'

&gt;&gt;I recently scored a nice 67 hatch to replace my rusted 66 hatch. I found 
&gt;&gt;it
&gt;was a 67 after I got there and notched the latch handle. Will this work on
