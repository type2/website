After a year in drydock, the 64 DC is on the street! Put 300 miles on it
this weekend.  One problem from the nose surgery, in which a '67 nose with
1/3 of pillars was welded in, and the '64 dash re-installed, the window
openings are too small, 1/8&quot; on the passenger side, 1/2&quot; at the driver's
pillar. Can't close the safari's, and the driver's door is real close at the
front, and can't install the outside rubber. So, another transplant from the
Madera pic-a-part 62 Kombi for the three pillars. Got 9-10&quot; sections, will
have some left over after the body shop fixes the windows if anyone needs
'em. Had to pay an entire dollar each. A year ago, I cut the wheel to wheel
left side off to graft on my 65, so there's not much holding the roof up.
 Ennyway, while sawing on the pillars, I noticed that the headlight buckets
were'nt round in the back. Has a flat, angled back part instead of the nice
globular ones I've seen. The 'foot rest' is flat, left &amp; right side. Rare?
Weird? What's the story?
I have a set of round buckets and turn signal holes if anyone needs 'em. Pay
for shipping and they're yours. The rest of the nose looks like
Frankenstein's monster's neck, but the buckets are in good shape.
