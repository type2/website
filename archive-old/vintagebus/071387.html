Subject: screws, oil and misc.

I have taken all the sheet metal off and it is at the powder coaters gettin
all pretty like.  So, now I am going to spend my weekend cleaning and
degreasing the rest of the engine and stuff.  Now to the point of my
posting....

1) there is a bunch of oil right below the pulley where the oil pump cover is.
Could this be mearly a gasket issue or more like a main seal from the pulley?
It does not look like the oil is coming from the pulley area (pulled the
pulley to get the sheet metal off)

2) Screws. I am missing a buch of the tin screws, Is there a source for these?
Is this something I can get at Lowes or something?

Thanks again.

-Tom
