You were talking about an inverter so for me to make the assumption that it is a 115 volt heater would not be out of reasonable (I hope). 

If that is the case then it will not work. You must have the inverter to make 115 volts.

Check the consumption of the heater then the output of the inverter. You have to have more inverter than consumption.

You might get this to work and work well, but how long will it work? You might be cruising around the block to charge the battery more than you would like.

I'd suggest that you look into a gas heater or a propane furnace.
