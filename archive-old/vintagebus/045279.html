&lt;&lt; Drill them out. Being Phillips head screws, it is nearly impossible to

 them off center. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Agreed!  Start with a cobalt 1/8&quot; drill bit, and use bigger and bigger HSS 
bits as you go.  Make sure to use little or no pressure at first when 
applying the bigger drill bits to the heads of the phillips screws or the 
tips of the drill bits will break when jammed against the X of the screw 
head!  Then just be very carefull of breaking off the tap and only use HSS 
tap not the cheaper ones!  Best to take it out quite often and suck out the 
chips with a nail on a strong magnet.  If you use HSS tap and break it off in 
there you can smash it into pieces with a punch and hammer.  The cheaper taps 
are not as hard so they do not shatter with a hammer/punch, but they are 
still so hard they will not drill out!   Eric&amp;Barb
