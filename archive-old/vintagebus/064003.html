Subject: Re: [VB] 009 with 30-3 Question Again!

----- Original Message -----
&gt; &gt; Best be with a 009 is to set the total advance to 28-30 degrees, and let
it
&gt; &gt; fall where it wants at idle.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; The problem with that proceedure is that then the timing at idle can be
&gt; anywhere, including 28-30 degrees like Eric's sister's 1969 bus which had
a
&gt; frozen advance system.  If timed only as you recommend this would really
have
&gt; the engine running hot at idle and including probable detonating from
being
&gt; too advanced at low RPMs.

By using a timing light to set the total advance, you would be able to see
where the timing settles at when it goes back to idle.  If you let off the
gas, and see that the timing doesn't go down very far, or not at all like in
Eric's sister's bus, then you know you have a problem with the advance, and
can fix it.  None of us drive around with known bad parts, do we?  Well, I
have, in a pinch. lol.  :-)

At idle, there is no load on the engine, so it's not nearly as crucial as
where the timing is at during a high load condition, such as cruising down
the highway.  Obviously, you don't want it way out of whack, but a 'working'
009 will settle down low enough.  That's why the 009 is better suited to be
timed for it's max advance, and let it go where it will at idle.  Running
too retarded while going down the highway, is a good way to cook the exhaust
valves, and drop seats.  I've seen an engine turn its exhaust pipes orange
hot while it's timing was set to 27 degrees _at_ 3000 rpm after running for
only 10 minutes during break in.  Engine was shut down, and retimed to a
total of 32 degrees max, and we finished the cam break-in with no problems.
Too retarded at higher rpm (especially under load), will kill a motor just
like too much advance at higher rpm (especially under load).

&gt;  Also if memory serves correctly VW stated as long
&gt; as any distributor reached 20 BTDC _at_ 2,500 RPM it was acceptable to the
VW.

I've never heard of this before.  Sounds like bad news to me.

Of course, running the correct distributor for the engine is the ideal
solution, which in a lot of the cases, the 009 is not.
