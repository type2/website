As an aside,

Does anyone know of a source for a reasonably priced front seat cover in
carmel brown for my 61? (dont care if the upholstery is vintage nazi
correct just that the color is more or less right... at least so it wont

no, but I know someone who does have rear (and middle?) seat upholstery that 
was taken off a bus of that colour  when it was nearly new.  If he still has 
it.
