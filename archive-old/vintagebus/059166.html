Subject: Re: clutch loose all of a sudden

&gt; From: &quot;rmcgill&quot; &lt;rmcgill_at_carolina.rr_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I thought the clutch wing nut was backing off because the clutch was
&gt; going away over a week. I tightened it, and it was fine.  Today, there
&gt; is no clutch because the cable is too loose. The wing nut was where I
&gt; left it, but the pedal now to the floor with too much slack in cable.

Could be a cable that was fraying and has now given way.  I'd check that
first.
