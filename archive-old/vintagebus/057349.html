Subject: re: [VB] Jalousie window &quot;pain&quot; replacement...

Self correction.
Wrote the previously related message from memory as I was goofing off at work.
After inspection of the actual item on the still for sale 67 Westfalia I
noticed that there are no separate retainers to be removed by screws. Simply
and carefully bend (if necessary) the upper retaining portion of each side of
each individual window glass pane/slat. It doesnt take much to slide the glass
out. Consider readjusting (rebending in the minor sense) the same area of the
window frame that initially allowed the glass to be with drawn.
Past this point I'll simply say to look at it and figure it out as you go. I
hear you all collectively saying &quot;no duh&quot; but it amazes me how many people
crank on, force and over stress things without first analizing what they are
attempting to accomplish. For them I suggest a re-read of Pirsig's Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenence.
Hey that sounds like a good idea! Now if only he had a book on maintaining over
active two year olds and cranky pregnant women! Oy vel!
