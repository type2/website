Subject: Re: [VB] Unacceptable

Ok , I didnt catch the part where you gave him the
bus.

If you got all of this in writing you may have a case
against him ,if not then your probably out of luck .
As others have said, take this as a lesson learned ,
It has happend to most of us as well and do the best
you can with whats left over from this event.
Good luck
-Bryan
