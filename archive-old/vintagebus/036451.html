Subject: Re:loaf to splitty front beam
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

but what about the 68-69's out there that need front beams? It took me a few 
months to find one.  several junkyards told me about the split-window 
conversion, and that's why when you do find a 68-69, the beam is gone.
someday, I guess, 68-69s will be the most rare of all....
