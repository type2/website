Y'all look for an eBay polyester Hawiian shirt, JB Stetson cowboy hat, Chuck
Taylor Hightop and shorts wearing goomer with a Swisher Sweet (Sweet
Coronella) hangin from his unshaven mouth. If that isn't enough of a clue
then look for the only poptopped &lt;OhmyGawd&gt; '54 Barndoor ambulance camper
that has Barndoor Safaris, a new shifter coupler and 16&quot; spare hanging on
the rear door. Black over RGB 192,192,192 grey. Vintage licence plate frame
might say &quot;Jim Ellis Volkswagen&quot;.
Second place to look is by the longest Chevy powered shiny White Westfalia
that you've ever seen. Stop by that Chevy Westy and see the AZ Bus Club
Raffle vehicle~!

Been bustin buns trying to get that pig (the '54) all back together for the
first annual &quot;Gilligan's Island Barndoor Cruise&quot;. &lt;A three hour cruise, a
three hour cruise&gt; Not enough Ginger, too much of MaryAnn and a guarantee
that my &quot;little buddy&quot; will be tired by the time that we hit Irvine. This is
as close to Bad Camberg that this rednecked techno-slave will ever come so I
try to have a good time of it.
See you all there! =)
VanBondo and MaryAnn, I mean, the Sweet Ms. Paula
