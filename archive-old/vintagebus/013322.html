&lt;thom here is just 1 of 4 post to vintagebus
&lt;am i blackballed or something&gt;





well i'm back, actually got back monday night
but the marathon weekend took it's tole on me
24 hrs going 3 days there 30 hrs back, no more then
4 hrs sleep a night, to old for this!!!!!!!!
so the stories are coming from the camberg meet so here's mine
NOS&lt;  NOS&lt;  NOS&lt; what did you need, it was there
roger nang on his steering lock quest i lost count after
his 3rd or 4th one, clara was his adviser as to what years
they fit, so he kept buying them till he got the right one
richard rustybus was on a major barndoor quest i brought back
a huge box of nos stuff and 2 westy trailer hitches, 1 the guy said
wouldn't fit any of richards buses because it came off a 50-51 barndoor!!! 
this was only part of his haul!!!
&lt;&lt;&lt;i myself had a great time got to go for a cruise around BAD CAMBERG
in a 1943 KDF and they drive it like a sports car,
&lt;&lt;&lt;then doing the sunday tour in the rarest of rare 1967 double
slider, factory orange, 21 window, walkthrough delux, it was fun
both sliders and the sunroof open 6 of us in it, wait till you see
the photos, and this bus is his daily driver in england, PS even
the owner doesn't know the true history of this bus, it's funny
all the stories on it though!!!!
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; as for parts watch out ebay, if you are looking for something
it will show up on ebay or pomona, thats the american way and part
of the talk at camberg, not my style
&lt;&lt;&lt; i got some cool stuff though, nos interior lights and lens
1 set of nos 61 tailights and 1 set of 60 and earlier, i got 1 steering 
column lock (beat roger to it) lots of nos fog and driving lights, accessory 
lights (plug in drop light) a couple of ski racks
(it don't snow in az) but had to have them, complete set of nos 1967
lights, front,rear, back-up. a few sets of 63 and earlier link pin sets 
(nos) and a whole lot more. just can't remember it all, can't
wait to unpack.
&lt;&lt;&lt; my thanks to kyle aka westfailure for his rides to and from the airport, 
and then helping me recover my left on the ground at the airport bag with my 
good stuff  in it, A HINT always tip the porter
good as he found my bag and turned it in unmolested, otherwise
it would have been history and someone would have had a bunch of cool
bus parts and toys.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but the true adventure happened driving home from kyles house
just a couple hundred miles to go in the infamous swap bus, boy is it
noisy inside when empty (first time in 2 years) after 30 plus hours
getting to the U.S. got a cheap flight but a lot of layovers.
all was going well cruising 70-75 in the bus, listening to the rattling
of the valve train, know it's working that way. hurray for 3.88 r/p
and the 1776 single port,  but less then 50 give or take 20 miles
&gt;from home it happened, a trucker in front of me and i had to pass him
as i did he through out a chocolate malt or something at me, hit the 
windshield, couldn't see and put the pedal to the metal, this guy was
out to hurt me, ran the bus at speedo pegged mph for at least 20+ miles, 
looking out the side window to see, while trying to dial 911
on the cell for help, as i got to the small city (parker) 2 cops
were parked having a chit chat, i waved them down, pulled over
knees knocking asked them for help, they nailed the trucker, saved
at last, at least i know the engines i build will hold together in
a panic situation, continued my cruise home, arrived 2:30 am, that makes it 
i can't figure it out but way to many hours up bad camberg to
havasu it 36 hrs or so, it was worth it.

PS. all those that e-mailed me for parts i'll be back up and working
today, got a lot of sleep, sorry for the delays.

PSS. if i can ever figure out how to post pictures wait till you see'm
