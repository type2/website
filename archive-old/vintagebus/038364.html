Subject: Trip reports - How to make everyone happy
Date: Fri, 31 Jul 1998 19:49:00 -0700

As long as everyone puts &quot;trip report&quot; in the subject of their trip
report messages, then everyone should be happy.

Since the list split, there really hasn't been as much traffic -- I'm
all for trip reports!
