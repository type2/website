 Last night pulled the tranny out as the nose cone studs are stripped.  (How
 that happened, don't ask me, but actually not the reason for this post...)
 
 The connector from the shift rod to the gear selector lever (hockey stick)
 seems to have fused to the &quot;hockey stick&quot;.  After a 1/2 hour of pushing and
 banging and twisting and 1/2 a can of WD-40, still no budge.  I had to
 unbold the nose cone just to get the tranny, balancing precariously on my
 floor jack, free of the engine bay.
 
 The last time the tranny was out was about 8 years ago.  Any thoughts?  Ever
 happe &gt;&gt;

no, never had this happen-   usually that connection is all greasy from oil 
oozing from the front of the nose cone and things come apart easily, unlike 
the front shift coupler with no conviently close oil oozing object.    

You did remove both screws holding the shift coupler on- right?   you can 
remove it from the hockey stick/and/or the rear shift rod that way.   tried 
twisting? 

might as well undo the front shift rod coupler and remove the rear rod and 
replace all your plastic bushings
