Located on 17th Ave &amp; McDowell (by the fairgrounds)
Have LOTS of 36 horse stuff 

On another note I have the 57 ready to have it's belly blasted and sent to 
get it's floors patched.  Biggest problem so far?  Is there any possible way 
to rechrome the taillight rings?  Keep in mind they are the dual filament 
bubbles. Other than that things are pretty smooth for now.  Hope to have 
ready by the next Phoenix Bug-O-Rama which probably will turn out to be the 
one after or the next.  
Still waiting for the pics to be developed of the MOTEST fuel gauge, which no 
one seems to know anything about?  Oh well.

Later for now
