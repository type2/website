Brian, would you like some help pulling your head out of your ass???  I
realize your shoulders are stuffed up there too, but I'd be willing to give a
tug or 2 (or wait, do I still want to cram more up there?)

Your post was pathetic.  Why would anyone think about such a thing?  maybe
it's the fact that you live in St Louis and that it's not necessarily the
women that are driving the busses who are crazy.  When I met Katie, I didnt
know a damn thing about air cooled VW's except for the fact that 57 was the
last year for an oval window bug.  she had her 60 kombi that she won at Jerome
and together we're slowly working on getting it back on the road.

I find myself almost heading down that road of equality issues between men and
women, but I wont go there.  It seems if you've taken a step backwards here.  

I realize your post was meant &quot;just for fun&quot; but I didnt find it that way.
Sounds like you may have some issues to deal with off list so next time you
and your buddies drink a bit too much budweiser and are sitting around
thinking of what it'd be like to have a &quot;VW Girl&quot; and make up sick stories as
to why it's the women's fault you dont have one (or cant get along with one)
and not a fault of your own, leave me out of it.  Jealousy just popped into my
head........could that be it?.....sounds good to me

sheeeeeeesh
