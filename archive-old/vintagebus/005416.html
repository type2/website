Subject: Suggested list advice on freeway flyers
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 20:47:02 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I lieu of this currect discussion with the freeway flyer topic, I might
suggest that anyone from now on who comes on here and asks about the freeway
flyer trans be told they will need a high horsepower engine to run it.  I
like mine but it pretty much renders my bus in 3rd gear with any kind of a
hill - even in Nebraska.  I'm hanging on to my 67 trans because it might end
up back in my 67 one of these days.

Anyway, I'd like to see the list pretty much agree on telling anyone from
this point on no to run the flyer unless you have at least a 1900cc+ engine
to pull it.  I kind of wished that I had left my trans stock and ran tall
tires like I had been repeatedly told by one of the listees (I think it was
Eric and Barb) but not for sure.

I know we can't all agree on everything but this seems to me to be a clear
cut answer to whether or not a stock engine can pull a flyer trans.  Not
even a 1776 with dual webers and 044 heads can.
