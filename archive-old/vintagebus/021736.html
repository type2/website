Any suggestions on VW places to visit in Germany-good places
to find
parts...or parts that might be a lot cheaper to get over here,
as opposed to
paying an import tax and buying in the US.

----------

You should visit the VW museum in Wolfsburg.  Besides the rare
and vintage VW's in the showroom, they have a small store and
a parts &quot;warehouse&quot; on site.  The store sells Brekina bus toys
and other cool bus memorabilia.

The warehouse is about 2000 square feet of space and they have
bins full of older parts (mostly mechanical).  Take part numbers
with you and they can search their non-computerized system to
look for stuff.  They let me look through the boxes for a couple
hours.  The warehouse receives parts from dealers that no longer
want to stock old/obsolete parts.

Also check the VW dealers throughout Germany.  It has been my
experience that they have more older stuff in stock than the
US dealerships.  At the very least you can score some key chains
with the german dealership names.

Good luck!
