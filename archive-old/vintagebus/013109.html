Subject: Horn ring?
Message-Id: &lt;199906021515.KAA21281_at_shell0.elnet_dot_com&gt;

I finally figured out how to fix my horn button on my 65 micro. The only 
problem is I need a new piece of chrome. Specifically, the ring that the 
button sits in. All the tabs have been broken off on mine, and the button 
flies off and hits the roof!

Anybody know where I can get one of those?

Thanks,
Chris
