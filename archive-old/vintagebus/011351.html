&gt; Subject: Re:  Front cover plate (splash pan) question

&gt; I think there are two kinds of splitty ones- a diff one for late
&gt; 67s, but may be not thinking straight.

You are thinking straight, but the &quot;different&quot; one is not just
for 67s.  It is for split window buses with the dual master
cylinder.  They just became standard in 67 when the dual master
cylinder did.  The difference is a cut-out approximately 2&quot;x2&quot;
square in the rear of the pan where the larger master cylinder
sticks out out of the pan.  Otherwise the '67 is identical to
earlier pans.  I have to assume there was a RHD version of dual
master cylinder pans as well.
