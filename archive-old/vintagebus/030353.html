Send people like that over to my house.  I'll do a days work for a grand!
Hey...I'll even pick up and deliver for that price :-)  If they screwed someone
for a grand, then they are NOT innocent!  While those of us on the list are
hopefully knowledgeable enough to know a snow job when we hear one, I still
think we should know who the shop was.   Some computer....wow!

&gt; I just got the shock of my life. A very good friend took his 64 delux in for
&gt; brakes and over $1000.00 dollars later, the highly recommended VW expert
&gt; shop, put the screws to him, or else my prices are way to cheap. What he got
&gt; was a NEW 67 only master, front wheel cylinders (varga) rear wheel cylinders
&gt; (varga) and rear shoes. No hoses, seals, front shoes, turned drums etc and
&gt; labor all this was done in the L A&lt; CAL area. I won't mention the shop's
&gt; name to protect the innocent, but boy did that hurt. The thing is did he
&gt; need all this, everything was new 3 years ago!

&gt; PS; he said the labor prices were straight out of their computer software
&gt; program, something like 146 dollars per wheel to change cylinders and they
&gt; gave him a discount!!!.
