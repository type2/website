Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Ring Removal Tool

LOL  !!

If you dipped your Xmas tree ornaments for about 2 minutes they would be
jello !!

Hydro Seal has been around for as long as I can remember--

It's made by Gunk --and can be ordered from any better FLAPS.

Wear rubber gloves---this stuff turn your finger's to jello !

It works great in any parts cleaning situation--removes carbon deposits
in minutes---

Great for carb rebuilding--

Ever go into a machine shop and get a wiff of the smell in there??
It's the Hydro Seal tanks ---

DO NOT APPLY TO THE CROWN JEWEL'S---:&gt;)



 
What is Hydoseal and how long do you have to soak the parts? Where can
you get it? I have heard of soaking and cleaning bolts, washers, &quot;nuts&quot;,
etc. I just googled Hydro Seal and the first thing I saw was: 
adult hydroseal. ... I have hydroseal in one of my testicles - I'm
concerned what treatment my consist of - - will I have to lose my
testicle? 
LOL Hey Terry have you ever checked out the MSDS on this stuff.
