Subject: Hunting for couple of things


My son is looking for a set of early style wiper arms for his '63 panel and 
is having some difficulty finding them.  Does anyone have some or could 
someone direct us to a source?  I may need some as well.

Also, awhile back there was a thread on the Wiper Pivot shaft assmembly... 
something about remanufactured with stainless or something.  Anyway... a 
line on that would be appreciated also.

Final note... anyone see the wiper armature 12V conversion kit in the first 
part of Hot VWs from Wolfsburg?  My son made a quick comment on it so I 
don't know much about it... anyone seen one up close and personal?  Quality?

Along these lines... I really need to learn how to use the archives.
