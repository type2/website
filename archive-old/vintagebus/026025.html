Subject: RE: [VB] Cargo Door Check Strap Color
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket
that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the
Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and
inquiring minds need to know.
&gt;
I've never seen an original mounting bracket that was not black.  But I only
really pay attention to Commercials.

I've seen a few straps, repros always seem to be black, original usually are
green.  But I've seen a few other colors, Khaki comes to mind.  I always let
them be as they were screwed-up originals.  I assume some years the straps
were black since they chose that color to reproduce.  FYI, the repro fabric
looks a bit off and feels wrong.

That reminds me that I've been unable to tell if my '55 Kombi rearmost cargo
door should have a strap, there are mounting holes in the cargo door but the
body just has holes with no threads.
