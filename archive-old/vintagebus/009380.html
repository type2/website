Thom:

I believe that there was some misunderstanding on the pricing.  As I
explained to you, the price for the TRW Locking Brazilian steering box is
$346.50 minus the 10% list member discount. Because we do not rebuild the
Brazilian boxes in-house, I do not have control on the pricing.

The ZF and ATE rebuilt locking box is $285.00 minus the 10% discount and the
ZF and ATE non-locking box is $245.00 minus the 10% discount. These we do
in-house and are slightly higher in price than others because of the
rebuilding process. This includes grinding .003&quot; from the worn surfaces with
a Landis OD grinder which leaves an excellent micro-fine finish on the part.
We do NOT shotpeen the parts to &quot;build up&quot; worn surfaces as most of our
competitors do. This results in the worn &quot;output shaft syndrome&quot; in a short
period of time.

The core charge is set at $150.00 to make sure we receive cores back. This
way, we can keep Buses alive and well.

As for the &quot;Hammerite&quot; finish on the Brazilian box, I will have to agree
with you there. We do our German boxes in standard black gloss automotive
enamel which costs about $30.00 per gallon.

The threads for the steering wheel upon visual inspection appeared to be
okay when your steering box was shipped. The threaded shaft should have been
wrapped in bubble pack. Please let me know if it wasn't. The newspaper is
used for packing and also because some customers don't drain the oil before
returning the core. As I told you on the phone, we would repair it at no
shipping cost to you or let you use our die to chase the thread.

Also, I am very sorry to say that I did not know that there was that much
difference in the &quot;turns of the wheel&quot; with the Brazilian box.
