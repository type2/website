... or should that be colour....

Last night I tried to match some of the original gray under carriage color
on my 59 dc with some dupont color chips.  I came up with the following
colors.

GS114
LS040 (or actually a bit more saturation)
RS205

From the chips, it appears that the gray really has no hue... which is what
you would expect for a primer.

Someone earlier suggested PPG DP50.

Using a spectrometer built by X-rite, a color match was made to some form of
t*yota 'Taupe' if my memory serves me correctly...  if this is true, I can
just see the VW committee on 'undercarriage color' deciding on the *correct*
hue of primer to use :-O
