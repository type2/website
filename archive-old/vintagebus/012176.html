I hear tell that it's not a good idea to reset endplay without rebuilding
the lower end.  I've always wondered if that is really true, so what's
your insight on that?  I think it had to do with inevitable tightening up
of the #1 bearing, which might explain your engines sluggishness if true.
  Any insight would be appreciated.
