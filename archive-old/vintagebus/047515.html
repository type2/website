&lt;&lt; yes, it is the right length cable.  It said on the packaging that it was 
correct... and I got it from a VW garage. &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Heh, heh...  First engine I put together by myself would not hold oil 
pressure.  Turned out the main bearings even though they were vacuum packaged 
right to a piece of cardboard from the factory was the wrong cardboard piece! 
 The bearings were 010&quot; bigger than the measurements on the packaging 
cardboard.  So your cable could be too long, due to being for a differant 
year bus.
  Also it could be that if your needle bearings in the flywheel gland bolt 
are bad allowing the input shaft and the clutch disc will shift sideways.  
Which in turn keeps edges of the clutch disc in contact with the flywheel, 
and pressure plate surfaces.  Making it a pain to shift into gear even though 
you have the cable/pedal adjusted correctly.  So make sure your gland bolt 
bearing is good, and when ever you reinstall an engine either put a little 
grease into this bearing to make it last longer.  Or if you have the clutch 
system in place put a little coating of grease on the sides of the tip of the 
input shaft to get some grease there into the bearing!   Eric&amp;Barb
