Thanks for the thought. I had not thought about the potentially corrosive 
effects.
I still will find the fix-a-flat can useful if I get stuck on a dark and 
stormy night.
BTW the rubber string thingy is what most shops do for repair and that you 
can do yourself.
Obviously the rubber string does not work with tubed tyres.
