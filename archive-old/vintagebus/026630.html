&gt; Hi all:
&gt; I've been working on installing new TMI seat covers on my truck's seats
&gt; today.  As I took off the old covers ( not original ) most of the sharp,
&gt; pointy spikes broke off.  A trial fit of the new covers show not much
&gt; extra material to work with and attach to the springs with hog rings.
&gt; Any suggestions on how to attach the covers?  BTW did I mess up by
&gt; buying 2&quot; thick foam instead of 1&quot;?    I hope not!  : )
&gt; TIA

First of all, never break off all those little triangular
thingies....Doh! ( Been there done that...:()
But now that you have....what I have done in the past is to first of
all, replace that string stuff in the edges with some good welding rod,
oxy-acetylene stuff. like 1/32&quot; or thinner than a coat hanger...or a
coat hanger if thats all you got. Or you can re-use the stuff in the old
upholstery. Then where ever you still have a pointy thing, use it, and
where you broke off the spikes, carefully pre-drill some holes and use a
screw. This is a semi-okie fix. but if done carefully, can save the day
and be nearly un-noticable. If you are going for trailer-queen looker or
show winner, then take everything to the upholstery shop before you do
more damage.
