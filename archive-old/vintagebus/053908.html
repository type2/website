Subject: Re: [VB] Sta-lube GL4

Thanks Jim,

I will have to give Sears a try. I tried to order GL4 from my local 
NAPA store (Los Alamitos, Ca), and they acted like I was speaking 
some foreign language. I also tried to order some zinc/epoxy primer 
from them with the same results. Hopefully Sears has the GL4 in stock.

&gt;Listees,
&gt;
&gt;I purchased Sta-lube GL4 and the nifty pump that fits the pint and gallon
&gt;bottles at my local Sears store in the automotive section.  Try looking
&gt;there.
