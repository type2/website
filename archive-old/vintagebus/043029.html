My anti-theft and anti-breakin solution has been the following, since
1974; it has more recently been augmented with alarm and hidden cutoff
switch since the restoration:

If you simply remove the door handles and leave them either on the floor
between the walk-thru seats, or keep one in the middle of the package tray
out of sight, it works wonders. You need a vise grip to turn the stubs
when the handles are off. When leaving the bus, I reach down (or
over-depending on which bus I am in) grab a handle, open the door, replace
the handle where it was, and leave. Easy. Forget safety issues. How safe
is the bus anyway. 

I have twice come out in the morning, found a window slid back, and no
entry (san francisco) over the years (26). Guess it works.
