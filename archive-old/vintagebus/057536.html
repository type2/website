Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove? 

Summer, 1998? enroute from Phoenix, AZ to Irvine, CA in June to the first
OCTO/Classic Weekend. My wife and I were traveling in the beleaugered 1954
Poptop Ambocamper barndoor freakmobile. 36hp on I-10 caravaning with no less
than 15 other buses. The Westbound plan made at Chiraco Summit was to &quot;all&quot; go
to Rich Yosts for the usual drum circle (kidding) and campout. Final gas up
somewhere beyond Banning. At that point the exit number was given and &quot;if we
got lost it was X more exits and then to the right up the hill. OK fine... 
We get lost or dragged too slow. Grinding up the endless Banning Hills into the
sun on the emergency strip on a Friday afternoon at about 35mph. VWFOOL_at_AOL_dot_com
crawls up behind us and eventually caravans with us. At &quot;X&quot; exits later we
leave the freeway and go up to the right. Immediately the road turns to dirt.
The road wound up the hill and around a left hand corner... No big deal as we
were supposed to &quot;go up the hill&quot;. BAM! around that corner the hilly dirt road
turned into literally a 35-45 degree incline with a 15 degree list to the cliff
side with a healthy drop off which alternated to a 15 degree list to the inside
with rain deeep ruts, big azzed rocks jutting out and no way to proceed or turn
around. I demanded that Paula get out of the Bus in case it went over the side.
The 4x4 safari windowed Barn-poptop-camerlator freakmobile being an ambulance
did not have a rear window but I knew that &quot;FOOL&quot; was right on my tail in his
inappropriately colored light baby blue single cab. I was basically four
wheeling it in the hand crank 6V barndoor. We had over-shot the proper exit and
were WAY over our heads. hahahah! Damn if it wasn't 4:20PM and no time for a
break.
The end result was that I had to back down that road without benefit of a back
window or super healthy brakes. My reputation for ruining shift couplers was
reinforced that afternoon due to under carriage scraping. The coupler held
tight until I exited the 405/55 on final approach to the Irvine Holiday Inn. It
let go in mid intersection on a green arrow in rush-hour traffic. A band clamp
from Ralph's (grocery store chain) hardware aisle saved the day holding all of
the pieces together until we returned home to Phoenix.
VW Howard would tend to think that our 25mph escapades up the Indio hill (I-10
East bound)to Chiraco Summit in the same bus was equally as whacky.
Good laughs now but, sheesh, what a trip that was.
