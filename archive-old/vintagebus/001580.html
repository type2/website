Terry wasn't interested in visiting the caves so he went back to camp and
left Rob, Justin, and I to see the world ourselves. :-)  We ended up on some
little back roads along the Mighty Missisippi (sp?) and finally made it to
Lover's Leap where some really scenic shots were taken.  When we rolled up,
a little girl went running out into the parking lot to grab her camera.  I
found out from the Dad when she saw the SC, she ran to get the camera
because she wanted Daddy to take a picture of it for her.  Rob let her sit
in the SC as well - very nice move on his part!

After Lover's Leap, we mosied around Hannibal and saw buses all over.  It
was like being in Colorado or California - bay here, split there, vanagon
there - really cool!  We followed some of our VW campers to a Walmart for
supplies including a big fan (WHEW!) and groceries.  Back at camp, we hooked
up the fan and AHHH it was nice.  Terry was there with his laptop moving
pictures off from the ram cards.  We just kind of bummed around, ate, visted
with listees and other T2ers, piddling our time away until the 9:00
ceremonies where awards and door prizes were given away.  John Cremer from
Jefferson City joined us this evening and as he had posted, he enjoyed the
stay so much, we took him to a phone so he could tell his SO that we wasn't
coming home until Sunday morning!  As we cruised around in the SC, I sat in
the box and played Rob's backpacker guitar singing good songs and made up
ones about breaking down.  Justin was laughing and we just all had good time
hanging out!

As for the festivites that night, I was proud to be honored for my work on
the BNNTA website with an aluminum dash plaque with the BNNTA #16 logo on
it.  I hadn't expected this at all!  I got to walk up in front of all these
people (couple hundred plus!) and receive my award.  I was thrilled!  It was
during the events that I heard Dave Easterwood's name called out as well as
Steve Lashley's.  I made it a point to keep an eye on both until I got a
chance to meet them.  Later in the evening, John Cremer and Dave Easterwood
came down to where we had set up camp and hung out with us - playing guitar
and bs'ing the night away.  Rob, John, and myself ended the evening with a
walk down the path to the lake where we looked for satellites, watched the
stars, and damn near fell asleep on the shale cliffs - enjoying the pleasant
breeze and lapping of water on the beach.  Very relaxing!!!

At the events ceremony, I won a $25 gift certificate to WCM as well - nice
touch!  Then there was the hard luck stories of getting there.  The prize
went to a family who dropped a valve seat in their bay window and and broke
down in yet another bus and still made it the 900 + miles of which 40 were
towed.  It included an engine tear down and reassembly or something along
those lines.  They deserved it.  There was another guy who was toasted that
burnt his arm and has 2 seized engines but this happened back in the spring
so although he had hard luck, he had plenty of time to still get his busses
fixed if he wanted to.  His commentary was hilarious though and had the
crowd laughing.

I fell asleep back at camp in front of my new fan, under a blanket, and on
my old foam mattress.  I was tired but a great night it was!

Sunday morning!

Nobody was up that early - having been hung over and spent from the
festivities of the night before.  Rob and Karen came around to say goodbye
as they needed to head home.  I slept in and wasn't really ready to do
anything until about 10:00.  Shawn and Sarah came around and we headed into
town for supplies. Our neighbors Jerry and Pat needed a ride to the Marina
so we dropped them off (Shawn let me drive at this point) and made our way
to Monroe City to the Hardees for a quick brunch and to the gas station for
fuel amonst other things.  Back at camp we decided to have a photo shoot.
Isaiah had wanted a group photos of the splitties but that proved to be too
hard to organize and lot of people didn't or wouldn't have wanted to pull
camp to move their busses.  It was decided then with Rob's fervent beckoning
with promise of an AWESOME photo shoot site that we would all take off for a
photo shoot and what a GREAT time we all had.  Our 5 buses (Terry's,
Isaiah's, Shawn and Sarah's, Rob's, and NQ's) all caravanned to South Lake
south of Monroe City.  It was a little rock road that went around a lake and
we stopped numerous times for great photo opportunities.  We took a LOT of
photos between all of us and this really was the highlight of the trip for
me.  Here we were, all of us listees, hanging out with out rides, taking
photos, etc.  What a great time we all had.  I'll have photos from this
event posted up somewhere after Terry and I get together with the webspace
issue to jump a few hurdles.

Sunday evening us Nebraska contingents moved closer to the rest of the crew
where we had cookout with hotdogs and burgers courtesy of Isaiah's touch!
What a great cook he is!  Shawn and I worked on adjusting his front brakes
and although they do pull to one side more, he's got more brakes than he had
before.  I do recall that front lugs were impacted on and were so damn
tight, I had to use the 4 way lug wrench with a jack stand as support, while
bearing my bouncing weight of 300 pounds at 12&quot; out from center to crack
them loose. Needless to say, that problem was rectified as well.  Shawn and
Sarah were both greatful to have me working on their bus and I was honored
that they appreciated it so much.  Woody also commented about me working all
the time - not being happy unless I was working on something (he was damn
near right too!) :-)  I really didn't recall seeing anyone else doing bus
work like I was aside from minor tune up stuff.  But whether or not that is
true, I still enjoyed being able to work on a listee's bus that needed help
and it felt good that Shawn and Sarah appreciated it enough to buy me a big
pack of Diet Coke.  It sure tasted good on the return trip!

I found out Sunday night while I lay there listening to Shawn and Terry
sling the breeze that this was it - the LAST night of the BNNTA.  I was
disappointed that it was over so soon because the event was listed as
running the 1st thru the 4th.  I figured that we would stay there on the 4th
and leave on the 5th.  When I was told that the events are run by the
evenings (you technically &quot;camp out&quot; at night anyway) it made sense but I
was disappointed that I only got to enjoy 2 and a half days of this.  I was
having way too much fun!  I fell asleep a good 2 - 3 hours before anyone
else did so that by Monday morning I was ready to go home - rested up and
all.  I had found good friends on this trip!  I also noticed an almost
sick/perverted fascination with people trying to get pictures of me in
attire other than my overalls.  I usually would mosie on over to the showers
in my PJ shorts carrying personals and I could hear the whirring of cameras
behind me and see my shadow cast in different directions from from the
camera flashes.  As usual, I threatened to sue if ANY of those pictures ends
up on a website someplace.  :-) :-)

Rob &amp; Justin, Terry, I, and Shawn and Sarah caravanned as far West as Macon,
MO and ate at Burger King.  I have a great shot of all 4 of our busses in
the lot parked together.  After bidding Shawn and Sarah farewell, us
remaining guys went out and checked out oil.  I have a great shot courtesy
of Justin of 3 buses and their owners crouched behind them doing what we
needed to do. :-)
We caravanned the rest of the day going West on 36.  We stopped at Cameron
to visit a friend of mine Dan Buser (but he wasn't home) and proceeded to
the local gas station to fill up.  I was parked on an incline and failed to
really notice this.  I thought I was a half quart of oil low and added
accordingly.  As we hit the highway, we were a couple miles down and all of
a sudden Terry hollered at me on the radio, &quot;PULL OVER!&quot;  In my efforts to
enterain us all on the return trip, I had become overzealous.  There was a
big thick white blue cloud coming out from my bus!  Talk about being
FREAKED!  After looking things over and reading the story the dipstick told
me, I had to figure out a way to rid myself of the excess oil.  I removed
the oil filter, dumped it, put it on, started the engine, and repeated once
more to get the oil down to the full mark.  Rob told me later that when he
looked back, he saw nothing but the front of my bus with a big blue cloud
around it, momentarily disappearing as the tailwind hurled my exhaust
forwards.  The rest of the trip was pretty much uneventful.  I decided to
follow the guys as far as I could and drove as far north on I-29 as
Rockport, MO.  We slithered over through historic Brownville and then on
into Auburn, NE looking for a little diner/cafe so Rob could treat us out.
After we ate, we said our farewells and headed for home.

When you are caravanning, you are forced to drive as fast as your slowest
member and since Terry is running bone stock everything, his bus was limited
to 55 on the way out but with the return-trip-tailwind, and cooler temps,
Terry ran 65 and it just purred right along.  I was glad to have him as a
pacer on the way out.   Now Rob and I both have flyer trannies in our buses
and with my 1776 engine, I took a few liberties to open her up. As loaded as
I was, I could maintain 60mph uphill floored but cruising was 65 - 70mph
easy.  I had her up to 72/73 mph once and she was starting to rev more than
what I was comfortable with.  Isaiah got to drive my bus and he remarked how
it handled the nicest of any bus he's driven.  I'm sure he noticed the power
too.  Cruising with myself, turnkey 1600DP, and gear, roofrack w/bike on
top, my oil temps ran about 190 to 195 from Auburn, NE back home to
Beatrice.  This was in 87 to 90 degree temps as well.  I just needed to
track down these pesky oil leaks that spatter the back of my bus up.

I'm sure I'll remember more goodies as time goes on but these are the
highlights of the trip.  It was over with all too soon!  My perspective of
the list has changed too because you meet these people face to face and any
preconceived notions of who they are, what they look like, go entirely out
the window! You have to take that mental notion and morph it into these
&quot;new&quot; people.  It takes a few minutes for it to soak in and then everything
is cool.  Meeting these folks was absolutely cool and it's really brought
the list more down-to-earth for me.  It feels more real if that makes any
sense.  I also saw Everywhere Ed (of course) and John - the guy with the bus
with the velcro interior, wood stove, ice fishing holes in the floor,
homemade safari windows, 13 gallons of bondo, lawn chair front seats, ROPE
START pulley (he let me start it too!!! - it worked GREAT!), and big old
truck tires in the rear!

I'll post a few of the excellent pix here and there but I'll let you know
when they are all up and available to see.  Thanks for reading.
