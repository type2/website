Hello list
I'm close to having the 66 westy back on the road, just a few little things 
left to fix.

One thing, not a real big deal, is the interior cargo door handles.  When 
your are sitting inside at the table and want to get out.  The door on the 
left is missing the handle,  so I pick one up on an old parts deal.  Anyway 
the problem is there needs to be a square peg (I think) coming out of the 
left handle assembly so that the handle can mount then get screwed to the 
assembly.  At lease that is the way for the right door but the right door 
handle assembly square peg thing seems to be made not to come out. So what 
I'm getting at, is there a part (square peg) that is missing in time or if I 
order an replacement handle, it would come with that made into the handle?
