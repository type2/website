Hi Mark,
We are not really good at knowing 1966 &amp; 1967 parts since we are more into 
the earlier buses, but here goes nothing...   
233 883 021 A     Seat bench, front (in load compartment) .............     1
                               with folding backrest
                               up to Chassi No. 236 190 000
8/58 - 7/64                009   grey 58-80
8/64 - 7/66                307    mesh grey/grey -83

233 883 021 B      Seat bench, front in load compartment ..............       
1
                                with folding backrest
                                from Chassi No. 237 000 001
8/66-                         009   grey 58 - 80
8/66-                         307    mesh grey/grey -83

So it looks like according to the parts manual that there was some kind of 
frame change for 1967 model year making it differant from 1966 and earlier.  
We also seem to remember that there was a change that a fellow bus owner we 
knew had to deal with.  The best thing to do would be to measure the mounting 
holes in the floor and take the center to center measurement to check the 
legs of the next seat you get a chance to buy.   Hope this all helps,  
Eric&amp;Barb
