&gt; I'm looking to do a re-bush on my swing lever. I checked out the type2
&gt; library and found an article about the procedure. The author (whose name
&gt; evades me at the moment, my apologies) did not find it necessary to use
&gt; the reamer in his successful installation.

gotta use it on the splits, not on the bays....

I used an adjustable reamer from a set my boss had.  they might have
something at the shop you can use, or maybe someones buddy..

i set it to just under the size of the new pin (using my dial caliper, and
trying not to ream the caliper in doing so!:) and cut that first.  

go SLOW, and back out often and clean /relube.  regular oil works fine.

after i got the initial cut, i _dot_carefully. worked my way up till the pin
just snuggly fit...

it really really helps to be able to remove the front section of the shift
rod...so get that damn coupler off.;)  if the bolt is roached, order a new
one from ron or whoever and have it on hand before you start!!  (believe
you me, its a major PITA to do it w/ that rod in there...)

as for installing the bushings, i just used a block of wood and hammer to
start them, then the appropriate sized drift..er..socket..to slide the top
one to the stop, then set the bottom where it was before (it may have been
flush..dont recall)

I didnt worry about them mushrooming, since i was going to ream them
anyway (the new pin does NOT fit in the new bushes out of the box!!)

the next hard thing was getting the pin in there.  that wavey washer is a
pita, and you have to have the pin oriented JUST right in relation to the
swing lever, else you'll trash the treads on your bolt when you try to
force it through there...hehe.  if it doesnt just slide in with moderate
pressure, the notch in the pin is NOT int he right place!

you maybe able to use a floor jack, bottle jack, whatnot to press the pin
up while you install the bolt...but i recall 3 of us under there with
asundry prybars to get at it...i dont really remember how we ended up
doing it.  it was late, i might not have thought of using the jack...and
my arm hurt from smashing my elbow on something under there. ahhh,.


i think that's it.;)

oh, MAJOR DIFFERENCE before/after.;)  tremendous improvement!

later...david (coming to s. ga for the campout dave?:)
