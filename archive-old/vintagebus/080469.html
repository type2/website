They wont weigh the same but only by a few OZ's so I dont think it will be a
worry.

Hi Ian,
We hate to rain on your parade, but using glass as a shift knob is a bad

idea, unless you can make it wiegh the same as the stock plastic shift
knob.  We 
have seen VWs with solid glass door knobs used in this way and the
tranny 
shifting forks in the tranny get worn out much sooner due to the extra
wieght.  
Even in the owners manuals, year after year they state it is not a good
idea to 
use the shifter as a hand rest for the same reason!
