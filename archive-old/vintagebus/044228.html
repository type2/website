Subject: Re:  Name Game

My '66 is &quot;SmartyBus&quot;.  I have no idea why, but when my 2 and half year old son (who by the way LOVES my buses) saw it he simply stated &quot;That's SmartyBus&quot;. Of course, this name stuck.  Upon reflection, my wife belives that I told my son to &quot;Come see my new bus&quot; and that some how his 2.5 year old brain twisted this statement into &quot;SmartyBus&quot;. So that's been the name since.
