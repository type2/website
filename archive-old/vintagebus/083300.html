Subject: Re: [VB] the dead horse to be beaten ( High oil temps on

Was writ:
&quot;i put a buzzer on mine as well&quot;

I was just thinking that I should do something like that this past weekend.
How did you do it?

I was just cruising up to Maine, and had the berg dipstick turn the light
on-not sure how long the light was on before I noticed. I pulled over,
waited about 15 minutes-then got going again, at a slower pace and didn't
have the trouble again. 

I'm planning on pulling the engine soon-will check all tin at that point,
maybe install one of those smaller pulleys-although I am 6V-so I don't know
if I need to change to 12V(something I've been contemplating for a while) to
get the different pulley to fit properly.
