Subject: Type2_dot_com list archives, CD-ROM and ZIP download ideas

Part of my desire to get a &quot;club like structure&quot; is to have some way to get
&quot;group consensus&quot; on issues that impact both past, present, and future
members.  If anyone questions my motives for presenting that idea, here is
an example.  This is one such issue that I seek some outside views...

The &quot;people who run the list&quot; have asked me for copies of the list archives
on a few occasions, and I've taken my time getting around to it.  However,
the work is now complete and I'm ready to give out copies.  However, I've
naturally thought of the implications....

Answering who &quot;owns&quot; the archives is a tricky question... one I'm not
prepared to answer.  By me &quot;giving them on CD-ROM&quot; to _any one person_ could
seem to be equal to giving them to _every one_.

You see, I know thing that others may not consider obvious.  I study the web
logs of who USES the archives... and I see a lot of people who use them that
(on the surface) don't appear to even use or KNOW of the mailing list!  This
would seem obvious that there are many more people who surf web sites and
find the archives... that have never heard of these mailing lists.  Many
more computer users are familiar with &quot;search engines&quot; and find out about
http://vw.i405_dot_com/ via links from Goggle, Yahoo, Altavista, other websites
than get told &quot;check the archives&quot; on the list itself.

Messages written years ago are being discovered (and helping) new people
every day.  I get emails all the time.

The Archives have via a web interface have always been open to all users
(regardless if you were ever on the list), so why can't the same logic apply
to a CD-ROM?  The same can be said of a &quot;ZIP bundle&quot; of the archives... that
could be downloaded over the net instead of a CD-ROM?

The issue of the day... what are opinions on this?  Should my &quot;distributing
old messages&quot; be limited to &quot;one at a time via a web site&quot; or should I make
copies of them in bulk (CD-ROM or ZIP file for download) to whomever asks?

  Stephen
