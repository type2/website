&gt;Dosen't loving splitties qualify one to be called a &quot;Luddite?&quot; 

It's a common misconception that the original Luddites were anti-technology or anti-new.  They weren't.  They were against the way a specific piece of technology 
was being implemented in their society -- and the deleterious effects that implementation was having on people -- and, since they were lower-class individuals with 
almost no regular political power, went on a rampage of sabotage and civil disobedience as a result.

Nowadays the term has evolved to where it is used by geeks to refer to anyone who doesn't download the latest version of MSIE within 48 hours of release.

What is the word for people who uncritically embrace any new bit of technology, regardless of its ramifications?  Dumbites?  Stupites?  Radioactive?  Extinct?
