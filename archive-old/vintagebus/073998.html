Subject: Re: [VB] My current project

I've more or less been in the same boat. My shop is up now, but still needs 
to have electrical and interior finished. But I've got some VW's in there 
and have done some a very little bit of work on them in there. I've been 
doing the Double Cab Rat Rod project under the carport. Kinda fits the 
theme though.

My biggest problem hasn't been &quot;the man&quot; (I live in rural west 
Texas)....it's been more time and especially money.

It's 25' X 25', and won't be quite as nice as Thom's. But I've got a 
separate 10' X 20' garage to use as a parts house and tool storage.

I'm like Thom, I'm working towards a more confertable future. It's a hobby 
after all and it'll make it more enjoyable for me.
