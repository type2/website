I'm still hemmin' and hawin'.   I've had a VW or Porsche event almost every 
weekend for the past couple months, and have spent a good portion of the 
time in-between preparing for said events mechanically.   I am burned out, 
mentally and physically (think &quot;Attack of the killer Tomato(e)s&quot; complexion-wise.)   
I don't know if I have the energy to drive 12 hours, mingle with the SoCal VW elite
for few hours, then drive home again.

I guess I'm going thru a phase of Ellis-esque VW burnout, sans wife and kid.
