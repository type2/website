Subject: Re: [VB] What is this?

&gt; Is this one of those replacements for the 9 pin turn/flasher relay boxes?
&gt; If so who made it and are they still available?  Anybody need one?

Woah, yes, I think it is.  I have something that looks like that in my '67
Squareback, I wasn't sure it was &quot;real,&quot; I thought someone (possibly a VW
dealer) had put it together.

It probably works correctly for a '67 Bus but does not function exactly
&quot;correct&quot; for a Type 3 because a Type 3 has a warning light for when you
have the parking lights on and not your headlights, it does not turn that
light on/off as designed.

Bus content:
The '67 Type 3 flasher relays are the same as a Bus, with a 211 part #.
