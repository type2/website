&gt; But then you probally don't like the Fridolen!
-------------------------------------------------------|
Correcto-mundo nor do I much like 181's. Too thin and open for the Things and
I'm totally out on ever again owning weird-assed-one-off-freak vehicles. Then
again, I'm usually 180 out on the market. Fridolins to me look like some
designers were holding a meeting in an Amsterdam coffee house trying to decide
what to do with all of the spare parts of the type IIIs and Bay buses... If you
want to get me into a boxy vehicle then find me a zero dollar 84-&gt; diesel
rabbit POS with a/c for commuting ptA-ptB and ptB-ptA only. High mpg and no one
wants 'em enough to steal 'em. 
Oh hell, any more I prefer a lazyboy with headphones attached to the television
so I can actually hear the friggen thing over the chainsaw/caralarm/catfight
catterwailing of the kiddies. Choosing modern vehicles on your credit card and
the title in my name? OK, give me a GLX level Passat W8 stationwagon with extra
sound deadening in the body panels.
WTH: I need 160 acres of heavily wooded land with a sound proof bunker in the
middle of it which contains the world's most comfortable bed. I'd gladly sleep
by myself with pistol-shooter's earplugs in my ears from right now until a week
before Kelly Park. I'd spend that week showing Heather Locklear and Jennifer
Connely what up with the real what up. &lt;hey now!&gt; Then I'd come out of my
winter hibernation and spend the summer roaming from Humbolt Cty, CA up to
Vancouver Island and back. About next Fall I'd comeback to Phoenix and yank the
family the hell outta there and spend the Winter in San Diego, New Zealand,
Austrailia and Hawaii. I could be a sales rep for Fat Tire beer and Trek
bicycles ~ at the same time. I'd invent a Trek Fat Tire bike with a
refridgerated frame filled with beer. Speaking of &quot;off road!&quot;

(not that I'd ever go off or anything) hahahaha!
