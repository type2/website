I would think that if you ran the hose from the breather tub to the valve 
covers your not getting a &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;! I think what he was saying 
was to run the breather to the air cleaner, and another set of hoses from the 
valve covers to the air cleaners. This is the best way to do it. because of 
the higher chance of back pressure that may be caused with running dual 
Weber's. I mean if you put them on your more then likely not gonna baby the 
engine. Especially when one of those little H*ndas pull up next to you! 
The cheapest way (but not the best) is to go down and get one of those little 
air filters and just put it over the hole in the oil fill, but with this you 
don't get any lube down to the cylinders where the Germans meant for it to be!
