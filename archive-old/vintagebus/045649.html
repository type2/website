&lt;&lt; I don't think I can make a smaller bend in that line.  Can't I use the 
other port at the back of the MC?  Please advise as I wish to continue using 
my belly pan, I spent too long looking for it.&gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Best to install it the way we reccommend.  The rear chamber of the dual 
master cylinder is for the front brakes.  Due to this they are the first 
brakes pressurized and thusly the sender is first turned on to give you brake 
lights.  Also the front brakes are the last on as you let up on the brake 
pedal so having the sender there is a good idea!  Go ahead and bend that line 
just a little more.  This is why we advise having a few more just in case you 
need the practice.

&lt;&lt;BTW I have a 65 standard, with the correct belly pan (I think, what is the 
difference in the 67 pan? &gt;&gt;
The 1966-67 front spash pan have either a cut out or a buldge pressed in them 
to allow for the longer dual MC.   Eric&amp;Barb
