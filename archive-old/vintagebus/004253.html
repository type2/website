 Does anyone have a list or breakdown on all the special Hazet tools that
came with this tool set? I am missing a few tools and need to know what part
numbers I need. This is a large kit. Metal box measures 13&quot; x 5&quot; x 21&quot; and
has 3 custom fitted wood shelves that hold all the tools. Top of box says:
Hazet 500 Volkswagen Werkzeuge ( dont know translation on that word). Thanks
for any help. See you all in Tucson at ABC campout March 27 &amp; 28.
