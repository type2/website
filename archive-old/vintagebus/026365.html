&lt;&lt; My personal fave was a '67 pop-top Westy with a 911T engine and a full
 roll cage.  The owner named it the &quot;913&quot;, but I called it bad craziness.
 It was cool, and very well done.

 I really didn't care for that bus, if you can still call it a bus. Some of
the other buses there was 66 swiss highroof, 54 standard, 59 euro single cab,
real dry Sundial camper, and Michelle Putman's nice 21 window. If any of the
magazines were there, I will bet that they will put a picture of the &quot;913&quot;
rather than any of the other kool buses. Swap meet was very slim pickings,
except for Kevin Murrays 23 window that was complete, except that you had to
buy early because the parts were also for sale. We did see a shortened split
at the Ice Cold Air in Orlando, and some ladie peeing right on the street also
in Orlando.
