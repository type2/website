Subject: '65 double door panel
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

OK,  A guy wants to trade my b*g for his '65 double door panel. I wanted to 
know if the '65 panle had the big window in back. I know that any other '65 
would, but I have never noticed any panels having the big window in back. The 
only thing that the list would probably not approve of is that the bus has a 
1776 with dual 40mm webers, and dropped spindles. But to me it is still a 
bus. I can fix it when I want to.
