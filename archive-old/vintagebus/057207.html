Subject: Re: [VB] pop-out latch refurbishment?

Thanks to David for the tips. I am still curious, like Charles asked
about chroming. If the part is pitted and the chrome is flaking how do
they get a nice finish with the new chrome? Is the old chrome removed,
and how do they do this? Thanks again, Chris

&gt; 
&gt; - push the pin out holding the pieces together.  Go down and buy a 
&gt; correct
&gt; punch as they should only be abut 3-5 dollars each.
&gt; 
&gt; - Reassemble with metric split pins.  I'm about to do mine for the 
&gt; 59 double
&gt; cab and I've been searching for the correct drill size as after 
&gt; chroming the
&gt; holes are not the correct size.
&gt; 
&gt; - When chroming things like this, make sure you take everything 
&gt; apart...
&gt; chroming doesn't work if stuff is still together and if your chromer 
&gt; is
&gt; anything like mine, he'll work with your parts just as you give them 
&gt; to him.
&gt; My guy is very meticulous but he still will not disassemble anything 
&gt; beyond
&gt; what you give him.
&gt; 
&gt; - I don't think I would powder coat these parts as the coating is 
&gt; rather
&gt; thick and I don't think things would fit back together correctly... 
&gt; Maybe
&gt; someone else knows better.

&gt; Hello fellow bus drivers - can someone please explain how to 
&gt; refurbish
&gt; regular short pop-out latches. I have a dozen or so in various
&gt; conditions, some broken pieces, bad chrome, etc. I was thinking I 
&gt; could
&gt; at least put together the best pieces to make a few good ones. Do 
&gt; the
&gt; little white knobs pull off or unscrew ( I've tried twisting them 
&gt; with no
&gt; luck ) and to take apart the pivoting parts would you drill out the 
&gt; hinge
&gt; pin rivet thing? Then could it be put back together with a tension 
&gt; pin?
&gt; On the good parts that just have bad chrome, what can be done? Can 
&gt; chrome
&gt; be removed, and then could they be powder coated instead of 
&gt; chromed?
