Subject: Questions about '65 deluxe
Date: Sun, 28 Jan 2001 21:13:27 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm planning to by a 21 window deluxe.
I've seen the bus today, but still have some question about missing (?)
parts.


Are the bumpers on a deluxe the same as on other splitties ?
(I know they have extra trim on them, but are they the same shape, ...)

About that trim :
Everything is with the car, but i noticed that the bolts to attach it to the
bumper are broken.
Is it possible to fit new bolts ?

The only things missing from the trim are the 2 pieces that are fitted on
each side of the bus (underside)
I haven't seen holes for them. Can it be that this splittie never had those
?

The number on the motor starts with F.
Can this be the original motor ?
1500cc ?

In front there are to single seats.(for one person)
And no, it's not a walk-thru.
Is this normal ?

The seats in the back are missing.
Is it still possible to get those things for a reasonable price ?

Also most of the interior panels are bad or missing.
possible to find ? price ?

I've noticed some &quot;jail-bars&quot; at the side windows but not on the back
window.
Is this normal ?

Thanks in advance
Cole
