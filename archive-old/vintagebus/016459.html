 I took a 40hp motor from a 61 or 62 bug, and popped it 
into a 59 SC, which I also converted back to 6V (the bug was getting a
1600 
and also the 12V stuff from the truck)  But I did leave the bug muffler
on 
it, adding a bumper with bug tailpipe holes, and tossing an NOS fresh air

40hp bus muffler in the cargo compartment for switching over someday. 
*snip*
this is why i picked up the motor 
conversion back to 6v.
 with my makita drill to the generator pulley bolt how many RPM would i
need to check the generator for output.
with the end play and dead cylinder on this thing i can't justify the $$$
to rebuild annother motor with a fresh 1600 sp in the kombi already
now i know the 40 hp fan shroud, tin. etc won't fit my 1600 *exactly* but
has any one tired?
thus a 1600 with old time feel?

aloha
