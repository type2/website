George,

As always, a rational and well reasoned reply.

Chris



&gt; First hand is fine, but if you're measuring the pressure differential
&gt; between the interior of the bus and the engine bay the results might be
&gt; deceptive if the bus is moving.  I'd suggest that you make a U-tube
&gt; manometer out of your tubing and place a temporary static port on the
&gt; outside of the bus, forward of the air inlet and perpendicular to the
&gt; airflow.  That way you'll have the true pressure differential between the
&gt; slipstream outside the bus and the engine bay.
