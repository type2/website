 If I only drove my bus 5000 miles a year it would be a full resto and would
be on a trailor to the shows. Mileage is why i went for the extra $150 a
year. Ask Haggerty or J C what the cost is if you drive your bus 25000 miles
plus a year to events and shows. I did and was told no way.

See ya at Jerome, thanks Kyle and Joe

John
