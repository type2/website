&gt;I was wondering - if you remove the rear shocks from a Bus, can that knock 
&gt;the rear wheels out of alignment over time and therefore cause uneven wear 
&gt;on the tires?

No on alignment.
Yes on tire wear, but not because of alignment. You end up with cupping 
because of wheel tramp. The wheel bounces up and down uncontrolled and the 
tread wears out in pockets.


&gt;
&gt;Or... Is the purpose of shocks to provide more than a dampening effect but 
&gt;to also keep the suspension at a consistent position while driving?

Dampening of spring travel only. Shocks do not change ride height unless 
they are air shocks or coil-over springs.
