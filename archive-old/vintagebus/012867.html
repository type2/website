I finally graduated from school with a Mechanical Engineering degree (and nearly a photography degree as well), but have not used it much because my current job supplies me with a computer with 21&quot; monitor, an ISDN line, and lets me work nights 3 days one week 4 the next from HOME!  I do software support for the systems Intel uses in its distribution centers.
I have also do some photography, but not enough to live off of.  I do take an average or 65 rolls of film on each vacation so if anyone wants to purchase some beautiful photos of Ireland let me know ;)  I have to decide how to decide how much film to buy for Bad Camberg and how much money to save for parts.  Anyone know how much stuff for sale I will actually find there?

Mechanical Engineer at a company that makes and sells cam and groove
couplings.
What's that you ask? Take a look at the ends of the hoses next time
you see one of those septic tank pumping trucks 8^). This is a new job
and I now have my own office - woo hoo!
