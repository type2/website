&gt; I have a set of tires that size that I am about to have mounted on rims and run

Jim,
If you are talking a later model bus it's not an issue for the rears.
Only 61 and
earlier I think.  215/15 donn't even come close to being a problem on my
67.  I hear you can run 235s on them.
On my 58 they are troublesome.

&gt; Please re-explain what you do with the plastic bag? You &quot;lubricate&quot; the wheels
&gt; with the plastic bag? I dont get it... Is the bag used between the rear wheel
&gt; well and the rubber of the tire to get it to squeeeeeeze past the fender?

Yeah, I use it so the rubber doesn't hang up so much on the metal.  The
double layer of plastic helps it slide in.

On the fronts of an early bus there are no clearance issues.  On a later
one you have to beat the jackpoint ridges out of the way with a bigass
hammer.

Maybe I can borrow the camera and send you some pics.

John
