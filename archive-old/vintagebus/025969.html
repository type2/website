So I guess this means I don't need to do a custom color?  It sounds like the
people in the know think that RAL 9003 (Signal White) is the best choice?  Now
what do I do about the inner and rear areas of the rims?  Do they get
semi-gloss black?  The reason I ask is I have an alomost mint, unused spare
tire rim that is white on the face, and the inner and back areas are a
semi-gloss black.  Also, do the bumpers get coated all white, or is it just the
front that is white and the inside (area closest to the body of the bus) get
semi-gloss black as well?

Thanks for all the help!
