Is there a difference in inside and outside diameter between a 6 volt and a
12 volt starter bushing? I replaced a steel bushing with a copper one, and I
was surprised at how easily the old bushing came out, and the new one
slipped in, however, I did it in part to alleviate a dragging starter, and
the symptoms didn't change. The starter that spins quickly in my 64 vert,
drags in my 66 bus.
