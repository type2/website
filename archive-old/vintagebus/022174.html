&gt;Last Time I checked,Neato was a club

Thanks, Mark.  NEATO is indeed a club, the national organization that 
OCTO (Orange County Transporter Organization) is a local chapter of.

I am very happy that Charlie &amp; Moe got together and decided to put 
something together to serve the CA bus community.  I am even more 
happy that they decided to do it under the umbrella of the NEATO 
organization.  They have brought an excitement back to the vintage 
bus culture in southern California and I think we all should thank 
them for that.  They have done nothing more than give the people 
there what they want.  They gave people a choice and the people 
decided for themselves that they were best served by what OCTO was 
offering.

I will be driving from GA all the way out to CA for the OCTO show in 
June, &amp; I hope to meet many of you there.  If you are not a NEATO 
member, I might twist your arm &amp; try to get you to join...

I want to thank OCTO &amp; all the other local chapters across the USA &amp; 
Canada, because *they* are what brings a national organization down 
to the local level, and gives the club a personality, not just a 
newsletter in the mail.  I suggest everyone get involved with their 
local clubs, because that is where you can get some of the most fun 
out of being in an organization like NEATO.

NEATO latest newsletter, Old Bus Review #72, went to the printer 
yesterday &amp; will be in the mail next Wednesday night, for those of 
you wondering where the hell the latest newsletter is...
