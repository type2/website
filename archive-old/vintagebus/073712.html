Subject: Re: [VB] firewall grommets

Eric&amp;Barb,

Get thee to your local electrical supply house (Lowes/Home Depot don't 
count) and pick up an aluminum cord grip.

&lt;http://www.thread-rite_dot_com/heyco/flexible_metal_grip.htm&gt; is an 
example. There're about a dozen manufacturers.  

Jim

&gt;We are still looking for those.  Found electrical grommets at Lowes a couple 
&gt;years ago.  Turned out they were so soft that two weeks later you could wiggle 
&gt;the metal fuel line up and down and hear it tapping on sheet metal again!!!
