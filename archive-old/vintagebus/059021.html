Subject: Need help with Tiger 581 CDI

Hello,

I installed a Tiger 581 CDI and when I ran the vehicle the points wire
overheated and the points fried.  I have checked all the wiring and it looks
correct.  There are 5 wires from the CDI, 4 together and a fifth black wire
added that had a ring terminal on the end.  I assumed this to be for the
ground and have wired it to the battery ground.  The unit is also screwed
down to the body metal with two #6 sheet metal screws which should provide
some grounding.  The way I have the system wired up is:

White wire from CDI to + on coil

Black wire from CDI to - on coil

Red wire from CDI to a contact strip with: 12V from ign. on, 12V feed to
electric fuel pump, idle cutoff valve and choke element

Green wire from CDI to points

Extra black wire with ring terminal from CDI to battery ground

After further testing this is what I have so far.  I replaced the points and
condenser and then reversed the plug at the CDI for non-CDI function and
turned on the ignition.  The vehicle wouldn't start so I left the ignition
on and went to the back to check the wire.  The condenser wire was getting
really hot so I disconnected it before it melted again.  At that point I
noticed that the fuel pump got louder which led me to believe that there had
been significant current running through the connection from the CDI to the
condenser.  A short perhaps?  Is there any diagnostic procedures to test the
CDI unit in car?  Can anyone give me the URL for Universal Corporation's web
site?

Regards

Thomas
