I jacked my bus up today.  I ran the steering through from lock to lock,
turns are 2 and 1/2.  From center to lock either way is 1 and 1/4 turns. 
It seems the PO's  adjusted the steering and set it wrong.  Also found
out I need the drivers side tie rod, the adjustable one.  The boots are
cracked and can see the balljoints inside, no grease.  Is there a way to
but zerk fittings on the tie rod ends?
