Thom,

Could you please explain the California YOM(which i think means year of
manufacture) regulations.

When I bought my bus it came with a vintage CA plate, and the original plate
holder. The guy i bought it from kind of inferred if i ever moved to CA I
could reuse the plates...

I don't really plan on moving to CA, but I like to keep my options open.

Also..has anyone had anyluck rechroming those license plates covers? The
chrome is beginning to chip off of mine.

thanks

kevin
