&lt;&lt;  am in the process of doing a side by side of the old
 transaxle and a rebuilt transaxle for my 66.  I needed
 to use the old nose cone.  So I wanted to renew the
 shift fork seal.  When I got back from the the parts
 store (a real VW place not Pepboys) the seal they sold
 me came with a new seal housing/carrier/thingy.  Well
 the old housing has an od of .715 where it goes into
 the nose cone.  The new part has an od of .605.  So as
 you can see they ain't going to work.  I'll probably
 have to change out the the nose cone so the new
 (smaller od) housing will work.  But it sure would be
 nice to go educate the parts guy about shift fork
 seals.  Could any one out here on the list give me the
 low down on this.
                       Thanks

...do you mean the hockey stick seal?  That is, the  seal in the nosecone 
where the hockey stick goes out to meet the rear shift coupler, that keeps 
oil from oozing out there.  The hockey stick being the roughly L shaped thing 
that is attached to the shift linkage and you move the tranny into gear with.
