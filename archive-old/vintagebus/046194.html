&lt;&lt; Bug and Bus fresh-air heater boxes are the same from 1964 (actually mid 
1963)
 and 1967.  They appear to be a direct bolt-in for either vehicle.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Not quite!  The DEC62 to about DEC63 heater boxes were a smaller outlet 
diameter, and the J-tube with exterior fins was only a round pipe inside.  
This one yearish heat exchangers should never be used on 1500 and larger 
engines.  The later heater boxes have larger J-tube insides and interior fins 
which help remove heat from the exhaust not only during the cold weather, but 
even during the summer.  Using the early one year heater boxes on later 
bigger engines will cause the engine to run hotter during the summer and not 
heat your interior during the winter.  This same problem, and cause are the 
same for the cheaper Dansk replacement heater boxes offered now with the 
later bigger outlet diameter.
