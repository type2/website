Subject: Speaking of tents......

The Corona show wasn't that bad. Being I think the 3rd or 4th swapper to
show up out of maybe 10 I had my &quot;goods&quot; out early for all to see. This
included a Sundial / Riviera style tent (that I still have and would
like to sell). Anyway along comes Joe &quot;Bug owner&quot; Swapper and he asks
about the tent. He says has &quot;a bunch of poles&quot; at home that were in a
Bus he used to own. Yeah, yeah, I've heard it before............ After
the raffle we load up and head out. He flags us down and asks if I want
to see the poles. He's on our way, kinda, so why not? When we get there
what does he pull out?? Low and behold the Westy tent poles I've been
looking for. They're a bit &quot;altered&quot; here and there, but they work.

I tried them out today with not too many problems. Due to my Panels
lowered height I had to make brackets that mount the tent to the rack
instead of the roof. Because of this I have to lengthen the poles that
mount to the bumpers, but otherwise I'm looking good. Look for me and my
new tent at Kelly Park.
I'll be selling that Sundial / Riviera tent if anyone's
interested.....hint, hint.

This is a prime example of why I always follow up on people's stories of
&quot;old VW parts at home&quot;
