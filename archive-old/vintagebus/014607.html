Subject: Re: [VB] spice rack/ wierd guage action ??
To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

well, I cleaned up the threads on the guage ground with a tap (it was pretty 
crusty, actually)  and reconnected everything, still acts wierd,  The temp 
guage reads 270 when I turn the key to on, and the oil pressure reads zero.  
Start the bus, the oil temps guage goes to the lowest on the scale (150 is 
where it starts) and the oil temp reads above 80 psi.  If I rev the motor the 
oil temp rises slightly, then dips back to still very high above 80- when the 
engine idles.  One guy posted his does the same thing.  Hmmm. BTW, in the 
other bus the guages did not do this, senders are pretty new,  oil sender 
/guage checked out a year ago and read consistant from then.

I have had 2 (two)  responses on the spice rack query, one said the top of 
the SO-42 spice rack is the fakey wood, the other said it is the white with 
the grey hatches like the tables that fold up.  Looked through the galleries 
at vintagebus_dot_com, samba_dot_com, joe clarks tent pages, even something else, 
found loads of westys, even a number of pics which showed spice racks, but 
not a durned one showed the TOP of the spice rack with the little flap that 
flips up.  All from straight on.  

ya, the spice rack I have is missing that top layer.

I think I'm going with the white/hatched stuff.
