At least we could get REAL parts then, without fit and quailty issues,
but I guess I'll need to start saving for 200.00 fuel pumps and 120.00
hubcaps now.

Subject: RE: [VB] The Volkswagen Protest


   A few years ago one of my best friends other half was a designer for
VW and was in charge and the US decision maker for portions of new VW. I
can't really say more because of the confidentiality agreement  signed
at departure from VWoA.  When I asked about the VW nazism about there
trademarks the reply was that VWoA is going to step up to the plate with
a NLA program like Porsche did in the late 80's. In order for them to
this they need to sanitize the market place of ALL non authorized
products. The time I was told of the program was around the same time VW
went on the war path. Rumor has it that there are prototype NLA catalogs
be scrutinized for this program. Porsche bought Stoddard Imports back
east and uses them as the distribution point for the Porsche NLA
program. I do hope that VW follows suit as the parts coming out of the
NLA program are as good or better then ORIGINAL and are accepted in all
CONCOURS judging.

&lt;&lt; I have found the Big 2.5 actually still make or have retooled for
some of the reproduction parts as well as having a group that will
license a part that meets their quality standards.Porsche has a similar
progam that they use for repro parts. &gt;&gt;

VW does license their logos.  We sell floor mats with some of the VW
names,
Jetta, Passat, Golf, Cabriolet, etc., all under license from VWOA.

If you want to offer products with VW trademarks contact VW and work out
a
deal.
