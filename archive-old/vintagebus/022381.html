Subject: Got it going! Now what?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well after my last message I decided to go over and work a little on the
Kombi to try and get the engine running. My battery was now fully charged
back to full power and I installed my new plugs and cables. I re-checked
the gap on the points as well. I went up front and turned the key and it
wouldn't fire. I then (after reading some stuff in the type2_dot_com library)
held the gas down and turned the key. After a few seconds the engine fired
up!!!!!

It ran a little sloppy, but it was running. I let 'er go for about 10 or 15
minutes while I had a beer to celebrate:) After that, I tried to set the
timing with the strobe. I've got a '75 engine and set the timing at 5 ATDC.
I also temporarily wired the butterfly on the carb open since my choke
isn't hooked up. Engine ran tons better. Now I've got a couple of questions
before I get on with a full tune-up.

I wrote down a bunch of numbers from my engine and thought I'd ask for some
help identifing the parts and help decide how I should tune this thing.
Here's the numbers:

Engine case: 	AJ065889
Distributer: 	JUR 4 &lt;-
		0 231 137 017
	vw	311 905 205 G (it's a vaccume disty)
Carb:		34 PICT 3

Now, where should I time this thing? Is the 5 ATDC right? Or does it need
to be different 'cause of the disty? 

And what is that disty off of? I can't find the numbers anywhere?

What do I need to hook the wire from the autochoke on the carb to?

Hope I can get some help. Thanks for the time.
