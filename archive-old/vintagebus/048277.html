If there is anyone going to this who has a little extra room in their bus, and
they are heading West after the campout I need a little help.  Believe it or
not I located the correct Binz only rear seat for my Binz.  Only problem is it
is in North Carolina and I am in Missouri.  Would appreciate any help
available getting it closer to Missouri.

Thanks,
Dan
