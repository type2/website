Subject: Summer trip to British Columbia

Hello all

We are planning our summer trip into British Columbia
and would like to make contact with anyone in the
western B.C./ Vancouver Island region who can give any
information/help/rest stop/advice/local secret places
information. 
We will leave Reno Nevada somewhere around mid June
and will plan on a month on the road in B.C. 
We hope to spend most of our time traveling around
Vancouver Island getting away from the 'tourist' spots
and get back into some wild country where we can take
our canoe and camp away from it all. 
We are also thinking of going as far north(maybe
further) as Barkerville and out to Bella Coola.

So if any listee can gave some insight on the region,
we would greatly appreciate it!!

We will be traveling this year (other trips have been
in our 67Sundial) in our 79Westy.

(If this post twice on either list...sorry)
