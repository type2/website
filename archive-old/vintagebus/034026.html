&lt;&lt; Halloween, hope to see pics of all your kids dressed up as busses!  &gt;&gt;

Kinda on the subject...when I was in High School, our group went as M&amp;M's and 
we all drove to the party in our VW's.  We all had Bugs, mine was a brown '66 
, and with all my friends, we had yellow, red, green and blue (before blue 
M&amp;M's though) 
Anyway, Busses are better :)
Happy Halloween! 
Laura
