Subject: Re: [VB] Changing from swing axles to newer CV joint axles

Hi Eric &amp; Barb,

Thanks for that perspective. I have long preferred the IRS due to
simplicity of removal and installation of the axles, but I have had
growing concerns about the stub axles. In fact, after reading the
procedure, I felt thoroughly intimidated and decided not to do them
last time I had the brake drums and axles off.

Being somewhat new to the swing axle models, I wasn't sure what was
involved there at all. It is nice to see it is so simple to maintain.

But coming back from the Lakeport show the other day, I did blow the
main shaft seal :-(

Thanks,

John
