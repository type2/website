To: Frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My '59 panel has the switch and is the old style &quot;pointed&quot; pod???? Prob is a 
truck thing?
Hmmm...

BTW---does anyone have an interior light and lens for the cargo area of my 
'59 panel
I need one as I'm finally gonna be able to have the panel done by the end of 
the weekend and will pay or trade parts for it!!!
Thanks
