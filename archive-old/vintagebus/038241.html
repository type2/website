Hi All,
Well, this morning I decided to re-check the code plate on my velvet green
panel.
And to my surprise is was built in November instead of March. An 'N' looks a
whole lot like an 'M' in the dark.
So the code plate reads:
 
02 N  (2 November 1965)
 
425 002 043  (425=safety belts, 002=??? no one knows, 043=Prep for Swiss
license req!? - I thought this was a US bus)
 
UN 2112 383883 6052366  (U=USA, N=New York?, 2112=panel van/cargo doors
right/LHD, 3838=velvet green top&amp;bottom w/ 83=moss grey interior, 6=model
year 1966, vin # made before 12/1965)
 
So, cool, I have a 1966 bus made in 1965 with an M-code that is no where to
be found and another M-code specifying a different country. (M 043 Maybe the
Swiss required more stringent safety stuff than the US, or maybe it was just
extra paperwork to be filed. I don't know.) Other than a rather sparse code
plate and dual years for the busses b-day I'm rather pleased with the good
condition my bus is in.
 
Oh yeah, here is the icing, the panel still has the silver rectangular
sticker under the code plate with the paint number and color of paint in
German (L512 Velvet Green) and on the overhead air duct there is a VW
sticker specifying tire pressure and max load stuff. Pretty cool!
 
If anyone knows what M 002 means please share. :-)
