Here is an easy question for those of you who have done it before... I have a
stack of worn deluxe trim and would like to polish it myself.  I tried the
steel wool on a fewe pieces but it doesn't shine as much as pieces I've seen
around.( I don't own a large buffing wheel ) What yields the best results?
 -----------

On a few pieces on my 61 (the ones that I replaced as the old ones were yucky
bent ) I used fine (1000 grit) sand paper I sat on a milk crate and had a
bucket o water and sanded it all for a while.  This gets the worst of the
corrosion.    then I got out clean rags (oxymoron?) and polish.   Oh so pretty
and shiny.     okay, it still has some pits and little mooshed bits, but ...
shiny, kinda :)
