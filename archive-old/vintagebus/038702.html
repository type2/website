Hi Vintage Van Folks,

OK, here is the scoop.

I now have enough pictures. Many thanks to all who sent them.

Due to the wonders of Variable Data Digital Printing I think (NO PROMISES
HERE) I have figured out a way to get everyone who sent in a picture to have
that picture appear in one of the months of their calendar. Because there
were some great themes and great novelty shots this is turning into a fun
piece. 

Photo Credits will appear as provided.

As far as payment and delivery goes here's what I believe will be the best
way to handle it:

For all those who want the calendar to arrive by Christmas:

Shipping via Express Mail (your trust in the US government snail mail
system)

3.00 for the postage
1.00 for my employee to stand in line with the package
25.00 for each copy of the Bus Calendar


Shipping via Federal Express Economy 2 Day

12.00 for Fedex
25.00 for the Bus Calendar

Shipping via Federal Express Standard Overnight

17.00 for Fedex
25.00 for the Bus Calendar

For the rest of the gang, orders received will be shipped the day payment is
received and you can request your preferred method of shipment.

Payment options:

Send Check or money order to the address listed below in my e-sig. We will
ship the calendar the day we get the $$. Make sure to include shipping
instructions and a good shipping address (remember fedex won't deliver to a
Post Office Box).

Governor Davis will get in my kitchen if California State residents don¹t
pay 7.75% on the calendar portion of the order (don¹t have to pay sales tax
on shipping) so Cal boys and girls remember this and give the Gov his dues.

Since I don't have a secure server, people who want to pay by credit card
are encouraged to call my office and speak with Carla or Anna. They have
been briefed on the particulars of this project and will be happy to take
phone orders.

Thanks for all the listers for their enthusiasm and help with this project!

Sam
