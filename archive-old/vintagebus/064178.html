Subject: progress report for the heck of it

Well after 2 weeks into a 3 day job I think I'm about halfway through.
I had parked it on a Thursday intending to be done at the end of the weekend
but I lost my motivation and work has kept me so busy Ive not been able to
get into the garage.
I got all the grooves for the treasure chest doors and deck lid wire wheeled
and painted, rubber installed, chest door locks were cleaned and soaked in
oil so now they actually work.
I replaced the transmission mounts for the second time in 2 months, this
time with urethane mounts, what a pain.
Tonight I had to replace the portion of the frame that the left rear bumper
bracket bolts to. It looks to have had a bracket ripped from it at one point
in its life, So I cut the section from my 63 parts bus and welded it in,
then boxed in that section like a baywindows rear.
tomorrow I will box in the other side , fabricate the brackets that double
as hitch and bumper brackets,  and get the motor put back in.
If I'm real lucky I will get the bumpers stripped and rattlecanned.
I still have to install all the door rubber but I think I will have to put
that off until a weekday.
it never ends
later,
 Bryan
