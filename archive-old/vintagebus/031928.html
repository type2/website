&lt;&lt; everyone's talking about &quot;Leistrich&quot; mufflers lately.  Is this 
 &quot;Leistritz&quot; (German brand) garbled or something you US guys'n'gals 
 have and we in the Motherland :-) don't know?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Erik,
It is the german Leistritz brand that they are talking about.  For those who
do not know of it, it is the only muffler brand that fits almost perfectly and
has twice the sheet metal thickness for double or more the lifespan of other
lesser quality muffler brands availible today.     Eric &amp; Barb
