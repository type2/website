No! No! No! If you believe you have no rust under your existing
undercoating, at least in some places..., at least rough up the
undercoating a bit, before applying POR. Get ALL the dirt out of
everywhere! If you see obvious rust balloons under the undercoating, use
heat or scraping, or both, to expose the rust, and remove the loose rust,
according to POR instructions. Time-worn undercoating, which is adhering
well, and has no rust under it, will hold POR well. I did that on my
restoration, in many places, to reduce the workload, and it has worked
well. Anywhere there is any question about rust underneath, or the general
health of the metal - you need to strip off the undercoating. A heat gun
and scraper with work wonders. Don't breathe the fumes!

Treat the rusted areas according to the POR instructions, going as far
with all options, as they mention. Then you can spray the POR with
assurance.
