Thanks for all the tips about my bus not wanting to stop...the general
consensus was that it is either on of two problems:

Shut off solenoid broken
or
Carb is dirty.

I checked the thing on the side of the carb, and it looked like the wire going
to it was not loose, and had a decent connection. 

The problem seemed to have dissappeared on its own, so after checking the
wiring I didn;t do anything else. It appeared again last night.

So today I got some carb cleaner spray, and some stuff you can mix with your
gas. 

My question now is regarding the solenoid shut off switch, if I need to
replace it, is it pretty easy to get one. Local FLAPS kind of tuff?

thanks for your continued support

I should hopefully be hitting the road tomorrow, after a stop at AAA, and some
paper work at school.

Kevin
