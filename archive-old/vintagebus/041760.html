&gt; This is known as &quot;brake fade&quot;, and is a very real phenomenon.  Once your 
&gt; brake drums overheat and expand to the point that the shoes can't touch them, 
&gt; you're in real trouble!  I had this happen to me when I was driving my father 

AFAIK 
Brake fading is caused by the fluid boiling the effect being the same as
having air in the lines. I dont think the drums could expand enough to
make any difference.
