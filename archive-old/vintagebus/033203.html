In a message dated 98-12-15 14:39:27 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Just when my bus was running great, my fuel pump sprang a leak and dumped a
great deal of gas into the crankcase. I found out when I went to adjust the
valves and got a bath when I pulled the valve cover. So, two days ago my bus
ran great and now it doesn't run too great. I have a feeling the bearings
suffered as well as the valve train, because the idle drops to around 600 and
it's uneven. Naturally I replaced the oil, filter and pump, but I don't know
when the pump sprung the leak, so I could have been driving it for at least 3
days (that's when I last checked my dipstick). Have you experienced this?
PS. I lost a 1641 in my bug on a cold February morning in 1995 due to
 this same problem. The crank seized on the #2 bearing. I guess it pays
 to check your oil every morning. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Ev,
Never to this extent, we have had little leaks that we caught with seeing that
the MPG figures in our log books suddenly dropped and went in search of
ansewers.  Do you have a oil temperature and more importantly a pressure
gauge?  These should have been warning you of troubles from reading
differently.  If not, get at least the pressure gauge and start getting used
to what it reads during differant times of weather/season.  The $30.00-80.00
investment will help protect your $600.00+ engine.   Eric &amp; Barb
