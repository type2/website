&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm gonna have to get me some heaterboxes for my 66 bus - for $66 each for 
&gt; Dansk boxes, that's hard to beat! &gt;&gt;

NQ,

for just a little more Marks VW in Amity Oregon will Rebuild your Heater Boxes, or sell you a set on an exchange basis. I had my swap space next to his in Puyallup. Better than any I've ever seen. Gonna have the ones in my 67 done before winter hits, I know Jack Maynard has a set up at his shop right now. I don't know his phone number pmail me back and i'll look it up.

Ty
