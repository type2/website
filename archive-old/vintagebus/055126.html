Subject: Any one cuttin up a bus?

I need to replace a rusty spot on the 64 Single Cab for it's Restoration and
hope someone might have this piece
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/4049.JPG it is a two layer section,
the top being the outer skin, and the underside has the U shaped channel. I
also need a few small sections of floor, just a little rusty place under the
gas tank.

Take a look at what someone used to help fill my drivers rocker panel
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/4046.JPG at least I don't have to
replace the whole inner and outer rocker!

Thank you!

Meredith
