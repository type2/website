&gt;I had a '74 D_at_tsun B-210 that I bought new in '73.  Along about '77 or 
&gt;so, the original carb went bad and the dealer wanted too much for a new
&gt;one.  [...] I installed everything, capped off all the unused vacuum
&gt;tubes and wires and managed to get it all to run well enough to get it
&gt;to a dyno-tuner that was recommended by the place I bought the carb.  
&gt;Once it was dyno-tuned, I swear, my gas mileage went from 27 to 35 around 
&gt;town, 45 on the highway.  I don't remember the exact horsepower ratings 
&gt;before and after, but I do remember an increase of around 20% or so.

So, to break it down:

Control: 4 year old stock carb that was probably failing somewhat before
  total failure.

Test: Brand new carb.  PLUS dyno tuning.  (changed two things)

Result: Better mileage.  Must be the new carb, and nothing to do with
  the dyno tuning.  (attribute all benefits to one of two things
  changed).

Please go study something called the &quot;Scientific Method&quot;.  After you're
up on that, study the &quot;Laws of Thermodynamics&quot;.  If that's too much
work, at least look at this web site:

http://www.tinaja_dot_com/pseudo01.html

In particular, http://www.tinaja_dot_com/glib/resbn26.pdf .

IMHO, there's way too much interesting stuff to play with in the
areas of mainstream science to waste time, energy, and money trying
to make your Bus get 100 MPG.
