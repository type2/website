&lt;&lt; What has changed since the 'good ol days'?  How was the hobby so 
different?  I'm
 sure it isn't just the new beetle... an awful lot of people have hopped on 
the
 internet since about that time... and I bet that helped it along too....  
I've
 only been into buses for 2 years now...so I really don't know what it was 
like.
 I can remember when I was a kid seeing them... and my mom telling me what 
Things
 were... so I knew about Things before buses...

well, kid.  That's right.   Parts were free and no one knew you.  you had to 
dial (with a dial.  you put your finger and spin the thing to make the phone 
number) long distance to talk to people out of the area.  There were lots of 
splitties in junkyards and you could get all the parts you wanted off 'em 
included that cool stained glass someone has put in instead of a solid side 
window for $5.   I could make you cry by telling you the things I saw in 
junkyards and left there.  Hell, you didn't have to go to junkyards.   There 
was this bus abandoned in downtown Santa Cruz for months.  The local 
splitsfolk took bits off it and homeless people lived in it.  I abandoned a 
58 bus on the side of the road (after taking the parts off it I wanted- 
mainly the tranny) so it wouldn't be there when the landlord showed up.  It 
still had a stamped front bumper and handles and latches and glass and a 
middle seat  (no gimme $550!!!)  Not only that, but... never mind

yup. parts were free, nobody knew you (well no one except the local circle),  
the buses gots 31mpg and never stranded you in a bad place.

The bug, the bus, and the ghia were the holy trinity

people gave their VWs names like &quot;Pride of Winnemucca&quot; and &quot;Hammock Erections 
in Canada&quot;

We gleefully painted our artwork over the original paint.  And put bumper 
stickers on them.

none of the vw folk wanted a new VW, whatever they called it

I met cool people just cause they drove VWs, and they said hi.

then again I avoided all VW clubs and shows and events cause they were SOOOO 
LAME!!!!!!! which I knew w/o even going.  Just hung with the hippy/Dead Tour 
VW heads.   To me, the hobby was hanging out with my friends.
