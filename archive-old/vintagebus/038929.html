Well Volks, i am getting the full lesson on this one. I was spending time
under Daisy to find my Zen last night, sans motor, and startin gup in to a
clean engine bay thanks to a presusre washer. I play with the loose backing
plates that the DPO put gasket material under, thinking I'll get to trans
disaasembly this weekend. Then it clicks...The damn brakes are in upside
down! Are the chances good my backing plates shot now?
	I have committed myself to this project, as i lost so much cashola I simply
must finish her, and never care about the costs, I won't be selling this
exercise in blood sweat and tears, ever... I have little VW experience, and
now I must replace the trans, attach axles, re do brakes, install an engine
(going turnkey here, found them from qualitygermanautoparts_dot_com, does anyone
have experiences dealing with them, or know where I can get a
counterweighted turneky 1600 that is well built) I would do the motor
myself, but not this time around..
I am hoping the front beam won't provide too many challanges, as the
steering feels tight, and it should mean just an aligment up there to stop
the damn 195 from scraping the arms.
	Am I crazy for thinking I can get a drivetrain in her by August, working on
weekends and nights? I figured a tunrkey motor and rebuilt trans would allow
me that goal.
 I appreciate all the assistance this resource and the type2 page has
provided me with, I wouldn't be this far without them, and i know that the
archive and library will be visited often in the future.
	I am also working on pdf versions of the DOC project, I have the new solex
manual done if anyone is interested. I find the PDF's easier to navigate
through.
Getting broken in properly....
Al
