It's OK to do it all anyway you like. Some people might not like the VW
Nazis but I just saw a very nicely restored Bus on eBay, sic! I know, I'm
sorry for using this word, (I'll put my flame retardant jacket after this)
and it was going for about $20K without meeting reserve yet. Reason being it
was ground up resto using only original NOS parts. Want to use NOS, fine by
me. Want to use whatever just to keep your Bus rolling, fine by me. We
should not get angry with each other. We are all bound by one thing. We are
nuts about Busses. Right?
OK, you can start now, I've got my flame retardant jacket on.........

&gt; &lt;&lt;For whatever reason this one hit my nerves this time.  Maybe too much
&gt; coffee this morning.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jeeeezzzee!!! I had no idea that my post would create such a stir. The
&gt; first  I discovered their might be a problem was this afternoon when I
&gt; read a reply from Clara.
&gt;
&gt; So i get home this evening and read the responce from Robert. . . and
&gt; all I can say is that there was no venum contained in the spirit of my
&gt; initial remarks. I admit, I used the term &quot;vintage nazi&quot; which I suppose
&gt; sets a lot of people off. But it has been brandished around quite a bit
&gt; here, and I only used it tongue in cheek. I will admit, that I have a
&gt; little trouble understanding the mindset, but not too much, since my own
&gt; restoration will be a pretty &quot;pure&quot; one. But probably not down to the
&gt; logos. But even still, what I said was not meant as criticism of people
&gt; that wish to be such purists. . . only to offer a suggestion on
&gt; recreating the little logos.
&gt;
&gt; I guess maybe us East Coasters are a little more thick skinned. Reminds
&gt; me of an old Root Boy Slim song. But I won't tell you which one for fear
&gt; of setting everybody off the edge again.
&gt;
&gt; Chilllllllllll.
&gt;
&gt; Sheeeeezh.
