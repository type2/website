&gt;&gt;&gt;I was wondering - if you remove the rear shocks from a Bus, can that knock
the rear wheels out of alignment over time and therefore
cause uneven wear on the tires?   

Or... Is the purpose of shocks to provide more than a dampening effect but to
also keep the suspension at a consistent position while
driving?

Mr. Everett,

No, the shocks have nothing to do with alignment.  Make sure your reduction
boxes are tight.  If they aren't, then you must get them aligned (or if you
can, align them yourself) if you didn't mark their position relative to the
springplates.  Slide the boxes back - and you will get toe-out.  Slide them
toward the front of the bus - and you will get toe-in.  Tire wear on the
outside edge of the tire indicates excessive toe-in, and wear on the inside
edge indicates excessive toe-out.  Same as aligning the front end.

Shocks keep tires on the road.  No matter how balanced a tire is, it will
still bounce.  There might not be bounce because of improper balancing, but
undulations in the road still exist.  Without shocks, the tire will tend to be
set in a bouncing motion until it can settle down again - and this will make a
tire &quot;cup&quot;.  If your tires are experiencing &quot;cupping&quot; or places all around
that have cup-shaped wear marks, you need new shocks.  Do the bounce test.  If
your bumper doesn't settle down after about 1.5 bounces more or less after you
romp on it, then you might need new shocks.
