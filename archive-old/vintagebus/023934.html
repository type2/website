	Well... that says it right there. I'm sure Mike meant *no* ill will
against anyone, even though what he did was wrong. I found a web page
long ago that had the Sermons available as one single file, but I don't
remember exactly where it was or if Bob had given his express permission
for that being done.
	It's a bad feeling to have, when you've tried to be helpful and have
instead &quot;stepped in it&quot;. It's also a bad feeling when someone's taken
liberties with your property. I think I've done more of the former,
myself... and so I can definitely appreciate the space that Mike's in.
But I also have some of that ol' &quot;don't tread on me&quot;/&quot;nip it in the bud&quot;
stuff in me, so I pretty much understand why Bob acted the way he did
when his copyright was infringed upon. 
	So... I think a quote from Patrick Swayze is appropriate... &quot;Be nice,
until it's time to NOT be nice&quot;. ('Roadhouse', tm, 198?)
	&quot;Being nice&quot; includes obtaining permission from authors concerning the
use of their work... and applies also to the judicious use of tact when
someone has wronged you or generally screwed up.
