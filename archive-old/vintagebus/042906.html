I don't have a garage right now since I'm living in an apartment, but my
parents garage still has some good stuff in it.

My step-dad's '70 bug is sitting in the right side of the two-car garage
almost
done being restored (just needs interior and the motor put back in).  In
front of the bug is the dual Webered 1641cc that will go in it.  At the
front of the garage is a makeshift workbench with my disasembled 2110cc
scattered on it which is slated for my '56 bug.  Against the walls of the
garage are countless boxes full of misc. VW parts.  My mom's station wagen
parks on the left side of the garage even though that has been more than
one occassion when I needed both sides for a weekend project.  Outside
next to the garage sits my '65 Kombi and my '56 bug (motorless).  Of
course I have other VWs at friends houses or in the parking lot of my
apartment.
