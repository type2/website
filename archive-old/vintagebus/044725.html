&lt;&lt; The issue that I am up against is the that the duct that comes thru the 
hole in tin is about 2&quot; in diameter ass opposed to the inlet on the stock 
1967 oil bath air cleaner is about 5/8&quot; in diameter. I need to find a way tho 
step down the hose from the large size to the smaller. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Remove the 2&quot; lower duct, and make a lower duct bracketed to the lower head 
exhaust stud out of tubing of the same size as on the aircleaner.  Then use 
the previous post of ours for the rest.   Eric&amp;Barb
