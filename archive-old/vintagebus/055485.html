Subject: Re: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus

Make sure the engine is supported by more then just bolted to the transaxle. 
  There are only two bolts at the transaxle supporting it so if you add the 
weight of the engine without any other support you are asking for problems 
down the road.  Also see if any additional sheet metal was put around the 
engine.  There is alot of open area when you stick a type I engine in a type 
IV bus.  Without the extra sheet metal the bus has probably been running 
hot.  In the winter that isn't so bad but the heat damage to the engine 
could have already taken place.

&gt;Subject: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus
&gt;Date: Wed, 3 Oct 2001 21:20:54 -0400
&gt;
&gt;So I'm considering buying a 74 bus that has a type 1 motor in it.  I sort 
&gt;of like the idea in that it'll be more similar to my 60 and it won't have 
&gt;any FI stuff - that I don't know anything about.  Anyone have any tips on 
&gt;what I should look for in a bus that's been converted like this.  My plan 
&gt;is to use this bus as a winter daily driver.  I figure if I keep the 
&gt;underside nice and clean it and spray it with chain oil a couple times over 
&gt;the winter, it should be fine.  I just don't want to drive my 60 in the 
&gt;Canadian winter besides the elements there are people who are poor drivers 
&gt;in the elements.
&gt;
&gt;TIA
