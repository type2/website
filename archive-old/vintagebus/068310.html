Subject: Re: [VB] Towing with a single cab

I have a small faux westfalia trailer that I tow with my
panel.  I don't have any extra cooling or brakes, and it's fine.

The biggest factor will be how big is your trailer?  My little
trailer is easy to manuver even by hand.  A double car hauler
probably wouldn't be as easy.

I've also towed a single cab with my bus, for a short distance.

&gt; I would think that as long as the trailer was equipped with a brakes, the only
&gt; issue would be pulling power and cooling.
