&gt;I  do not really have that much body work that needs
&gt;to be done.   So it would cost me more for the welder
&gt;then it would be worth

What I did on one of my vehicles a few years ago (a
Beatle if it matters) was to get everything ready to
weld, and then had a welder come over and spend a
couple of hours actually doing the welding.  He was
the brother of a friend, and had previously had his
own body shop, but was now retired, and he did a great
job and charged me $25 an hour for two hours.
The secret was to know the right people (I think he
was dirt cheap, and it was partly because I knew him.)
I would think that you could find someone to do this
by asking around a lot.
