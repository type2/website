&gt;My 60' kombi is giving me some fits.  It severaly hesitates when
&gt;accelerating under load..ie when shifting from 2nd to third going up a
&gt;slight incline.  Carb rebuilt (28pci), new points, condenser.  It hase
&gt;been timed correctly, and the points and valves adjusted.

Some ideas that may or may not help...

Did it previously work OK?  Did you change something trying to fix this
problem, or did you do something else (carb rebuild?) before this problem
showed up?

When you adjusted the points, did you set them with a feeler gauge or a
tach/dwell meter?  I find that using a tach/dwell meter usually results
in better power and driveability.

Getting enough fuel?  Check fuel tank filter, inline filter (if used),
fuel pump adjustment.

Which distributor do you have?  Check the specs at
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com and see if it's one that was originally
supplied with your engine and carb.  If it's a vacuum advance, make
sure the hose is OK and that there are no leaks elsewhere in the
intake system - throttle shaft, carb flange, head flanges, etc.  If
there is a leak there won't be as much vacuum and the distributor
won't advance enough.
