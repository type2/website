&gt; Rachel... check out the article on Slate this morning re librarians and the 
&gt; destruction of books.

that nicholson baker really chaps my hide!  he is mostly talking out of his a*s with very little scientific evidence or professional background.  i don't know what pisses me off more:  his hysteria mongering or his description of librarians.  the wanker - i'd like to run him down with my truck!  then again, why expect more from the author of &quot;vox?&quot;

in this new book of his he states that from 1968 to 1984 the library of congress destroyed up to 300,000 books worth about $10 million and altogether libraries around the country destroyed at least 975,000 books worth $39 million.  how many of us have thrown away broken parts that would be worth something in at least scrap metal?  it seems to me that people generally get weird about books in the recycle dumpster but i suppose it's no different than someone bringing me a volkswagen hubcap they found on the side of the road - never mind it's mangled, rusty and repop.  i still say thank you as does my library.

according to baker, librarians wear &quot;quiet silk scarves,&quot; bow ties and understated suits.  we gaze out at you from beneath &quot;wise-looking eyebrows&quot; and &quot;cheerfully bald&quot; foreheads or through &quot;large, rectilinear glasses similar to those joyce carol oates used to wear in pictures.&quot;  he says that the unassuming librarians are destroying library treasures and doing so all the more effectively because we pad about in sensible shoes and tweed.  give me a f*ckin' break!  i may be the exception at librarian meetings with grease and dirt beneath my nails and ground into my hands but so are my colleagues - rather they are the exception to baker's picture of librarians and i am the extreme exception.

a better book to write would have been about the threat to materials due to lack of standardized preservation guidelines, but i suppose baker felt beat out by the new draft report put together by the council on library and information resources.  in the report, the council states as an example that the wax cylinders on which the earliest recorded voices of native americans are etched &quot;are susceptible to mold, heat, skin oil and physical trauma.&quot;  thinking about standards of preservation, i don't now that there are many standards in more than just the book arena.

my mind is sometimes unable to stray far from volkswagens and when thinking about preservation i think about restoration.  just like volkswagens, an &quot;original condition,&quot; unmarked book is more desirable than one that has been &quot;restored.&quot;  but outside of unmarked, original condition, what kinds of restoration standards are there?  what makes a 100-point show car?  ronnie has said how way more attentive to details the porsche crowd is and i have heard of shows where judges are more interested in whether the volkswagen was mechanically sound and in working order, had a good spare tire, breakdown parts, usable tools, etc.  man, how embarrassing to loose a first place position because your show car doesn't have operational turn signals!

then there are the terms... oi!  stock, original, restored, resto-custom, nos, ros... it's a long list and infrequently the terms are agreed upon.  my two running beetles, though shinny and mostly stock (as from the factory), would be considered by everett barnes to be in the resto-custom class.  not being crazy about the custom part of that classification, i do however have to agree with his definition.  my two running beetles, though resto-custom (restored but not stock) have never won an award where as my truck, not stock, not very original, nasty and banged up, has won two awards.  go figure.  i suppose that just as there are not many standards for preservation, restoration and judging shows, there aren't standards for people and their preferences.  i'd still like to kick baker's a*s in my librarian stilettos.
