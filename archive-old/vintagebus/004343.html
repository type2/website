&gt;This is a  rythmic thunk that slows the
&gt;slower I go, think is is there only not under driving load.  I am going to
&gt;jack it up and let it run in gear and listen, and figure out which
(hopefully
&gt;not both) side (s) it is, and tear it apart.   I love gear oil.  YUM  :(
&gt;Maybe the side gears cracked or the big circlip pooped out or the fulcrum
&gt;plates died or I really don't know.    I really want definition.


If it's rythmic it's almost got to be fulcrum plates. When you are under
load the rear end tends to lift, so if your rear end is sagging (on the bus
8^O), when you are under load it might tend to straighten the axles in
relation to the side gears and not work the fulcrum plates as hard. They
would almost have to be tight to make this noise, if loose you would think
you'd just hear one clunk when you accelerate or decelerate, not the rythmic
one. I had mine up with jackstands on the torsion housing and the front
wheels blocked all to hell. When it started bucking it shook the bus a
little. Don't want it to fall on Clara, be careful. Also, if you tear into
it try to have the same plates on each side of the dovetail. The stockers,
single groove, and double groove fulcrum plates are different thicknesses. I
don't know how much effect it would have to have a stock on one side and a
double groove on the other, but it prolly would not be good. Better to have
a single on each side.

Good luck
