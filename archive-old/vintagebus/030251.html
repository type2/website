Subject: Re: New Microbus

I don't think that any one can make a decision about what kind of car
the new bus is going to be, at least until it has been built. In the
long run the new bus will either have success or not have success based
on whether or not it is an inovative and flexible vehicle and not on
whether or not it shares the name or some styling themes from an earlier
vehicle. There have been several examples of cars like the GTO and nova
that have shown that.
