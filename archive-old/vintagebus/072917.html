Subject: paint gun

Well I just bought a paint gun, devilbiss HVLP suction feed. It is not for
my bus immediately, I thought I should get to know how to use it pretty good
before I even think about using anything on my bus.

 

But the thing came with practically no directions on use (just on cleaning).
Do you guys know any good sites with info on how to use a paint gun; I have
done a little searching without any luck.

 

I tried playing around with it today, I just had some latex primer, I
watered it down, and tried spraying-using the two adjusting knobs on the
gun. It appears as though on controls the amount I am able to pull the
trigger, I am not sure what the other one does.

 

Basically barely any paint came out-at that rate it would take me about two
weeks straight to paint one door.

 

Any immediate suggestions.I think I may call the company tech support line
and ask them..

 

Thanks for any suggestions though
