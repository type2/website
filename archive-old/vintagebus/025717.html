Right on!

&gt; Anyone know how much those instant polaroid cameras cost?  Maybe we could
&gt; all chip in and buy two of them to be passed from bus to bus (heck, use the
&gt; cameras as the baton).  That way, 1 or 2 pictures could be taken of the
&gt; participant and their bus for each leg of the rally and passed along.  Maybe
&gt; a diary book too.  Then at the end we could have the pics scanned in and
&gt; posted to a web site along with the diary entries from each participant.

What about just using some of those &quot;disposable&quot; cameras? No need for
fancy
polariod film and we could still have the web site. Those things are
cheap enough.
I'd be willing to buy one to cover my leg of the trip if it comes
through Knoxville.
