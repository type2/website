Hi.
been twidling some this week with an engine i'm shoving into the 54 - only a
temporary thing until i get a right* engine.
so - to my problems - of the many.. the main headache is wiring...

i think (?) i should have a smaller diameter dynamo with mounted voltage
regulator...  but only have available a bigger -diameter version and a
separate 6 volt regualtor..

but where do those dang wires go then???.... i've only got the 2 free wires,
all the others in the engine bay are planned elsewhere.

just downloaded thoms wiring diagrams (**thanks thom* :) and and the 2 wires
i've got are the ones for the dynamo.. so how do i go about splicing in a
separate regulator.

also on the right wheel arch (still in engine bay) theres an electrical
gizmo thing (bosch) ... about 3inches long x 1 1/2 inches wide, with about 8
wires coming from it..  could this be a separate voltage regualtor?....
although it is a lot smaller than later 6 volt regulators if it is.  if it
isn't ---- what is it? :)

Glynn  - confused - will be dazed when the wife sees this mess.  -- filthy
keyboard!.... where the hell has all this oil come from - pesky kids! ;)
better wash my hands before i use the pc next time eh.:)
