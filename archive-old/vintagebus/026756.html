Subject: Re: [VB] Panel Restoration - what to do?

        The same decision that i have had to make in the last year.
I bought a logo'd(Gila Land Surveying) 61 dd panel in New Mexico and brought
it to Chicago.
I worked a month or so on to get it road worthy and sent it out to Lenny
Copp
at West Coast Classics to perform the body work.The body work if fairly
extensive as the bus had been dented up and bondo-ed severally.No rust
though!!  As a matter of fact Lenny took the belly pans off of it to have
the belly pans made for the 53? barndoor deluxe they just finished .When
they had my belly pans off Tony said there was no rust at all under the
pans!
    Anyway the colors I've have chosen are based on the fact that I am going
to paint my  business logo on the side of the bus and use it to make
deliveries and park in front of my store. Also Vw made many panels for
businesses .Many companies wanted to paint their buses in their colors and
so Vw would only prime the bus ( m-code #m030 or m031).
This way I can rationalize to paint the bus the colors I want which are
light grey bottom(L345)and pearl white top
(L87).The way  I went about figuring what to do was peruse Everetts' and
Thoms' websites(thanks guys!!!) and books and found the perfect panel. IMHO
the coolest logo'd panel I have seen is in the book called &quot;Volkswagen Bus
Camper, Van &amp; Pick-up,Colour Family Album&quot; by Andrea and David Sparrow on
page 15 and 96.WOW!! A man can dream can't he ?
            Happy dreaming,  woody

&gt; I've always thought it would be cool to restore a panel, because
&gt; you could paint it just about any way you wanted short of hipp-dippy.
&gt;
&gt; I like yellow.  I thought of pimping it up with a big Bosch logo.
&gt;
&gt; When buses were tarted up for commerical use, were the insides
&gt; painted to match, or were they left the original color inside?
