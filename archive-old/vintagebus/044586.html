&lt;&lt;SOTO has the dibs on this day for event and soto was first.  so all the 
people that are going to octa should rethink it and go to the event that was 
there first and that will be a better show.&gt;&gt;

Look at it this way, If the original show was so great and so well run, there 
wouldnt be a need for a second show.  Well, sadly, SOTO aint what it used to 
be, so other bus enthusiast have decided &quot;hey, I could do better&quot; and did.
