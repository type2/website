George,

When the busses get fewer and further 'tween, you might change your mind.

I too have had the problem of one person trying to out bid the other, but I
am true to my word and the first serious person gets first refuseal within
a reasonable amount of time.

If everyone did business as you do, I wouldn't have half the busses that I
do.  Some of the busses that I have brought home came from as far away as
800-1000 miles and the transaction happened over many days.

If I have found a bus that I would really like but is a distance away and
the seller says &quot;first money buys&quot;, I am REALLY STRESSED because there is
no way I can get any money to them any sooner than over night.  This way of
doing business doesn't relieve stress, it adds to it!!



&gt;When I make a deal of
&gt;this sort, I tell the phone buyer that &quot;first cash buys&quot;, which means that
&gt;I am still free to sell to that Japanese gentleman that walks in off of
&gt;the street.  This also motivates the phone buyer to get the cash to me
&gt;toot-sweet if he is truly interested.  I don't fiddle around with deposits
&gt;either.  The simpler and quicker the transactions, the happier both
&gt;parties will be.
&gt;
&gt;If I'm the buyer, It behooves me to get the cash to the seller ASAP.  This
&gt;eliminates some long-distance deals, but it also eliminates
&gt;disappointment.  This hobby is supposed to be fun, not stressful.
&gt;
&gt;George Lyle
