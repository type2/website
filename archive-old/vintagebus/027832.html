&lt;&lt; So what viscosity oil do most of you guys use in your VWs?  I have been
 using 30w for so long that I never gave it much thought.  I know that it
 turns to sludge in cold weather but I dont drive my old VWs much in winter
 so it never was much of an issue.  I always figured I could run 20w50 in
 summer and 10w40 in winter but i never had any issues so I never bothered to
 change weights.  All my engines are well broken in single ports, so if i had
 something a bit more modern i might pay a bit more attention to it.

I use castrol 30wt in winter, (temps usually 30-45*F, rarely down to 20* and 
20/50 in summer.  When I went to AZ last spring I went to 40wt, which is 
thicker than 20/50, both by pouring it and evidence of the oil pressure 
guage.  My oil pressure gets pretty high using 20/50  when it is cold out, so 
I change to thinner oil when the oil pressure gets close to peg (when it is 
about 70psi) upon startup  even if its a bit earlier than my usual 3K mi oil 
changes.
