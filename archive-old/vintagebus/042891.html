A friend of mine is selling her bus.  It is fairly straight with just a
few minor dents and a bit of rust in both rockers.  Most of the original
Velvet Green paint is there with the exception of the brush painted
areas.  The bus is very mechanically sound, with a good running 1600cc SP
and fairly recent brake and suspension work.  There is a partial Westy
interior including the rear-facing single seat and the back seat, but no
cabinets.  The doors panels were redone by someone with woodgrain masonite
and the headliner is wood and looks like a Sundial headliner.  The front
seats could use a re-upholstry job.  The taillights are funky and probably
came from an auto parts store.  This bus is a driver and could easily be
driven anywhere in the contenental United States.  She's asking around
$1800.  E-mail me directly for more details or call:  (208) 892-3650
or(208) 667-2490.
