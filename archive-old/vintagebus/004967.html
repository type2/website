I learned how to drive in a bus. Actually my 67 kombi is what I used. First
time out took it to the phx. bug o rama. I had no license and the bus had no
plates or insurance. Bad! My dad just threw me in the drivers seat and we
cruised along. Had a great time. Only one cop saw us but for some reason
didn't pull us over.

On the way I lost 2 hubcaps because the PO had the tires inflated to about
50PSI!! Hit the cattle gaurd going there and coming back. He made me go hunt
them down with cars wizzing by too.

This is the reason that when my 67 was hit on the side I didnt let them
total it. Too many emotional strings attached

Also, to go off topic for a second. Those of you who are upgrading to AOL
6.0, many users are having problems using it to post to mailing lists.
