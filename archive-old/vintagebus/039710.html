Subject: Re: [VB] too much pressure (its got to stop its got to stop)




&gt;From: vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org (craig k)
&gt;I have been battling carbs for some time now as the List knows (or maybe
&gt;&gt;Excess fuel pressure.
&gt;
&gt;

Ok so this may be answered by now, I am reading mail written a long time 
ago, so Oh well.

However:

I have had problems with my dual carb set up. 2 Kadrons.
I talked at length with someone at Kustom1 warehouse.

He suggested that lots of carb failures are due to high pressure fuel.
At least the dual Kadron setup. I dont know how it affects single carb set 
up, but he had seen many dual carbs not working because of the high pressure 
caused by the increasing use of after market fuel pump stands. These vary in 
height. Correct shimming is necessary. He uses a fuel pressure guage to 
determine flow pressure then adjusts through shims, or grinding.

Pressure needs to be down around 2 to 3 lbs. I dont have my notes with me 
now, so take that with a grain of salt.
I will be buying a pressure test guage and adjust accordingly.
I really want to get my bus going again, and with the 1776, the dual carbs 
really let it fly. Its not on a splitty so dont ask about ratios and crap 
like that.

Jason
