&gt; Well guys and gals - stand behind me here - I'm keeping the redux boxes and
&gt; the 6v system.  It's gonna be a long road of people asking me why I don't
&gt; convert to 12v but I must admit, it's gonna be fun having a &quot;souped up&quot;
&gt; engine with a 6v generator on it. :-)

NQ,

Sounds just fine to me.  Since you are going through everything, just take the
extra time to clean the contacts and connections around the bus.  Doing that the
6V will work just fine.  The only thing that I could think of that would
remotely be a problem would be if you ran your CR so high that the older 6V
starter would have a difficult time turning over the engine.  I saw nothing in
your post that mentioned drag racing CR.
