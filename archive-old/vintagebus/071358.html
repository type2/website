Subject: Re: [VB] Bit of a find

I'd say grab it.  If you get it home to find it very rusty or something,
sell it to somebody for them to part out or something.  Even as a donor, it
will better serve the rest of the buses in the world than it would if it
were crushed.

Oh; and Wade's correct, RHD rules.

'67 Deluxe Bus

&gt; Looks like it has a mid57to mid58 &quot;flat&quot; decklid on it...
&gt;
&gt; Id at least get the safaris before it gets crushed. You should post an
alert/directions on samba or
&gt; vintagebus for those australians that might want it no matter what for
parts at least, if you choose
&gt; not to get it.

&gt; Rhd rules.
