  Got a call from NQ last night at 9 pm, they have made it to Phoenix
allready!!!  They are/were at Kyles house (aka westfailure) and will be
heading up to Havasu today, they are 2 days ahead of there plans, just goes
to show that all Rob's worries were for naught and that buses do CRUISE at
60+ mph for hundreds of miles without problems if MAINTAINED correctly.
Looking forward to entertaining the Buskatiers tonight.
