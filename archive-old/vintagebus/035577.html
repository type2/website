Subject: ladders and steps
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Two questions for the group....
First.  What is the weight limit on the roofrack ladders? I seems to me that 
if someone that is too heavy climbed one it might dent the beltline or 
something? Anyone?
Second.  What are the sidesteps going for these days? There's one on 
Everett's site for $225.... that seems like a lot. There's a guy in my 
neighborhood that has one and I'm pretty sure he knows what it is, so I 
wanted to know how much to offer. (I know what it's worth to me, I just 
wanted some feedback first) 

Thanks,
Brian
