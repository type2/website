Very good in my opinion!  If you'd of gone to Pomona yesterday you could have had a COMPLETE early westy (pre-65)with tent and privy for 4K!  Not cheep, but with tents like that pushing 1K all by themselves, the bus for 3K seemed like an OK deal.  I'm not sure if it sold or if it'll be there on Sat., but here are a few pictures from Everett's site thanks to Greg.

What are the chances I could fly out to the Classic in Irvine this weekend, 
find and buy an early camper ( to 1966) really nice shape and drive it home 
to Wisconsin all for $5000 (4k for bus, 1k travel)?
