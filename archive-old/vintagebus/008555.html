Steve;
I noticed the same thing last fall when I first got my '67 bus on the road.
Somebody out there correctly identified it as a resistance problem, caused
by 30+ years of oxidization and corosion.   I noticed it more at night, but
I think that was more than likely because the &quot;glow&quot; appeared brighter.

I spent a morning resetting and cleaning all the wire contacts under the
dash with steel wool, a pencil eraser and emory paper; I also replaced fuses
and cleaned up all the contacts on the fuse block.
The problem went away.

Hope this helps

&gt; i cc'ed this to both lists as it applies to 67 and earlier and 68-71 US
&gt; t2's...
&gt;
&gt; On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.
&gt;
&gt; At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
&gt; glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
&gt; appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.
&gt;
&gt; My only 2 guesses are the brushes in the gen itself are going bad, but
&gt; that wouldnt explain why it still charges... My other guess is that there
&gt; is a short in the indicator circuit of the regulator but not the charging
&gt; circuit...
&gt;
&gt; anyone else have any ideas? is this a classic symptom of ____?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Steve
