I agree and e-wedgie sent, I do really enjoy cut and paste and 2,000,000
bytes later of his own message hopefully he will take his custom late model
somewhere else.

&gt; 1972 custom westy (currently dead)

You know it's getting bad when a bay window owner spams the splittie list.

Time to invent the e-wedgie.

Bus content:  I had a blast at buses and balloons it truly was a great show,
the balloons were awesome, more people need to plan to attend next year.
Met Jamie from Canada, a great guy, (we need some photos Jamie).  I had a
great day at the swap, going in all we had was a bag of quarters and still
came home with lots of little goodies, thanxs for the quarters Doug your
seat arrived safely and the gas money was well spent.  Thank you everyone
for a great weekend.
