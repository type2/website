&gt;Stephen,
&gt;Are you going to be sued by VW?

yeah they'll prolly add him to the list. VW of America aren't the nicest
gents known.
check out this page which used to be the biggest link page of VW sites I
have ever seen. over 100 links at least. but he can no longer run it. Why?
cause VW of America has some mental probs and dont care about their devoted
followers who keep them in business. check out the link and bring your
doggie bags cause im sure this will make you sick.
