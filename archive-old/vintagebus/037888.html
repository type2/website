Subject: Who are all the east coast people???
Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2000 02:23:13 -0400 

Why do all the west/midwest people have all the fun?  Any of you east coast
people want to fill me in on whats goin on in our neck of the woods?  Im
about as east coast as it gets. (on the beach in Ocean City, Maryland).  I
just missed the Bug Out in VA but was hoping there might be some more swaps
and shows i could hit this summer.

Lonely in the rust capitol of Maryland
