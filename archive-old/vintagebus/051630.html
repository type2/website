Subject: Re: [VB] 6V starter bushing in 12V transmission

If you have a 12v flywheel, you must use the 12v starter.  

No if's, and's or but's.

&gt; Okay I was able to find the bushings listed on line and would expect the
&gt; local Bug specialty shops to have one.  One thing that I didn't mention is
&gt; that I have a 12V flywheel and a 12V tranny housing.  Can I use the 6V
&gt; starter if I use the special bushing or is there a mismatch between the
&gt; flywheel and the starter gear?
