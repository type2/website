&gt; Help! I'm trying to ground my rear tail lights on my 60 Single Cab as you 
&gt; suggested. Trouble is, the bulb holder doesn't seem to be metal--or at 
&gt; least 
&gt; not the kind that a magnet will stick to! Is it potmetal? It is the early 
&gt; round style light.

Hi Sue,
That means you bulbholder/reflector is made of potmetal.  Then you are stuck 
with drilling and screwing the ground wire to it.  Run the leftside ground 
wire up and over the engine lid opening just inside the engine compartment.  
You will find the stock wiring harness there and you can spiral wrap the new 
ground wire around this to keep it from falling down and getting caught in 
any moving engine parts and generally getting in the way.
  Last year we helped a fellow with his 1958 restored 80,000 original miles 
Westie.  Without the ground wire system you could not tell which way he was 
signaling even at night, due to both taillights flickering!  With ground 
wires installed on a nice morning with the sun already up the taillights got 
about 50% brighter and the taillight not signaling stopped the darned 
flickering.  The owner was flabbergasted at the improvement.
