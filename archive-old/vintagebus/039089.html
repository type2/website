Well, I verified it.  I did indeed order, receive, and install the
clutch kit (pres. plate, disk, TO bearing) that Bus Depot sells for the
71-79 bug.  I should have got the one for the 62-70 bus.  

WHY did I do such a thing?  I didn't do enough research.  All I knew is
I needed the 200mm clutch and I guess I figured since I had a motor from
a 74 bug then that'd be the clutch I needed.  EEERRRRT!  Wrong answer!
The clutch is dependent on the transmission type/year/style, not the
engine.

So, what do you all think?  Can I get by with what I've got?  It seems
to work, but feels a little wishy-washy.  Will I damage anything (other
than the clutch itself) if I continue to use it?  Such as the clutch
operating fork or the transmission itself?

I'll buy the correct one eventually, but a few months down the road
would suit my pocketbook much better than doing it today.  But I'll do
it immediately if I stand to damage other components.

Thanks.
