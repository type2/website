Subject: Re: [VB] Georgia collection of 20 VW's all for $2000.00

If making the money was that easy, why doesn't *he* do it?

Whatever happened to the guy with the rusty sunroof standard from
hell, the one that was getting parted out to the 4 corners of the earth?
He was in Georgia.

If these cars are anything like the ones in that mess, you wouldn't get $6
much less $6000!

Here's the pix:
