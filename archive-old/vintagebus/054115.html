&gt;1.) On a pre-1965 engine case with a &quot;B&quot; coded engine that was originally
&gt;a 1500cc, what was the original case bore size on the number 1 bearing?

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/wog69/013.png says 65.00-65.02
new and 65.03 wear limit.  That's 2.5590-2.5598 and 2.5601.  Also
&quot;B&quot; code and &quot;pre-1965 1500&quot; don't go together.  All of the B code
listings I see in various books are either B5 ('68-'70 1600) or 
B6 ('70 1600) .  For the question you're asking it doesn't really
matter as http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/wog72/006_m.png shows
the same tolerances.  

&gt;Our case is measuring 2.5745&quot;.... comments?

That's 0.0155 to 0.0147 bigger than new.  I don't *think* you would 
machine a case 0.015, so I'd _guess_ it was machined 0.010 at some point
and has worn further out from there...
 
&gt;2.) Can you use the 1600cc cylinder bores in a 1500 case without
&gt;machining?

You can put 1600cc cylinders on a 1500cc case with no machining, but
I'm not sure if that's the same question you're asking.
