Subject: Re: [VB] Need Single cab

Damn!  And I couldn't sell a straight, reasonably
dry, uncut, good-running '55 for $2000!

&gt; I saw a singlecab for sale about 25 miles south of
&gt; Ronnie's shop in Lake Havasu on my way back from LA
&gt; yesterday.  It was yellow, 1958, cut wheel wells,
&gt; incorrect front bumper, no rear bumper, white spoke
&gt; (Jackman?) wheels.  Said &quot;new engine and tires&quot; in the
&gt; window.  He's asking $2750.  The phone number was
&gt; 520-667-4886.  I think Ronnie is familiar with the
&gt; truck, and somebody from Havasu could maybe look at it
&gt; for you.
