Subject: Re: [VB] Give me a VW Bus anyday



&gt; Now I know why I love VW's so much, easy and
&gt; inexpensive. I was shocked though that the rear brake shoes, drums and new
&gt; wheel cylinders for the truck cost LESS then on a VW Bus and they are some
&gt; massive units on the truck, go figure.
&gt;
&gt; ronnie
&gt; www.volksresue_dot_com   used buses and OG parts in there natural state,
coming
&gt; soon to the web near you.
&gt;

Ditto, Gen. Ronnie.

Re: OG parts .. does anybody know where I can get a set of OG Hoops and Bows
for my 65 Crew Cab? These are the only parts I lack on my resto. I don't
care what shape they're in, I can fix em.

Thanks

Steve Bradley
