&gt; Mark, are you sure? An expanded thermostat actually pushes the flaps
&gt; OPEN to allow more cooling air around the cylinders. A broken bellows
&gt; will not expand thus the flaps will not open and the cylinders and heads
&gt; WILL overheat. The spring on the flaps lever in front of the fan shroud
&gt; is designed to hold the flaps closed and the heated EXPANDING thermostat
&gt; forces them open.  
&gt;

Hello Raymond    The one that I had that overheated so bad had bellowed 
completely out of the bracket so that it had pulled the flaps closed, this was on a 
type 1 motor. Also I still have the therostat on my 36 hp that is in my 51 
std bug, ( the motor is a 1953 year) later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
