Subject: Re: [VB] new aftermarket ...

top (easily-handled) speed of &gt;most&lt; cars in the late 60s was 70 or so.
busses were not that hard-pressed to keep up. with jackasses doing 90+ and
cops doing N O T H I N G to stop them, the bus now has a great deal of
trouble even staying out of the way. leading to overheating.

not to mention the fact that the gas ain't the same :)
