Has anyone ever heard of Parkway Motors?  I believe it was either a VW or 
Porsche dealer in the '50's or '60s.  I am looking for the city in which it 
was located and the years in which it was open for business.  I'm also 
curious as to what makes they sold.  I picked this up last spring at a swap 
meet and believe it attaches to the engine lid.  Thanks in advance.
