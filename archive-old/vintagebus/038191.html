&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any experience installing these mechanical gauges? It

 like a lot more work than a electric gauge...I guess eric and barb are right 
i may be better off installing an inverter, or search at some vw shows for a 
used 6 volt gauge like clara... &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Yes, we have some experience with mechanicals.  They are better than just 
having idiot lights to tell you your engine is fried.  The problem is they 
are slower to react especially the oil pressure when a really small tubing 
size is used and this tubing can easily cause an oil leak from rubbing though 
anywhere along it's length.  Temp gauges seem to work better that the 
pressure gauges, but almost always are too short for the bus length to get 
the gauge into the bus dash area.  
  We have run our 12 volt tach and CB on a 6 volt system with inverter to 12 
volts with no problems so far.   Eric&amp;Barb
