James,

Whe i did my 60 crew cab a few years back, the gates came off W/O too much
trouble.  I used a manual impact wrench to get the screws out.  I messed a few up
in doing so though.  I would start using some penitration fluid now and appliy it
and some heat daily for a week.  then get in there with some head and the impact
wrench and they should come off W/O much trouble.  The key is taking your time
and the heat.

As for getting the rust out.  I had mine acid diped.  I do not know if i would do
that again.  It removed all the rust, but it also left the inside of the gates
bare metal.  I poored paint inside the gate chanels and roled the gates around to
try and paint the inside.  It work OK.  The other 2 things i found withthe Acid
dip is that you will find alot of areas where the metal will disapear (pin holes)
fron the metal being real thin from the inner rust.  the other (and most
irritation) is that the gates weaped Acid nutraliser from the seams for at least
a year.  Not cool on a new paint job.

What i think i would try now is maybe porring some rust newtraliser into the
gates and rolling it around.  I do not know of any other way except cutting the
gates open which i would never recomend doing.

Hope this helped

Matthew

&gt;
&gt; I fear attempting to remove as im sure they have never been off in
&gt; 37 years.  what am I in for? how should i best go about gettting the screws
&gt; out...will they break? will where they are bolted in break?
&gt;
&gt; also....how best to treat loose(?) rust inside...that I can hear everytime
&gt; you lift gates up/down....
&gt;
&gt; thanks
