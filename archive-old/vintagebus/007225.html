Subject: Re: [VB] [F] Bumper Sticker of the Year

Some of my favourite lines I would like to see on a bumper sticker are:

Hey Dodge!  Who invented the minivan?

Too slow?  Too bad!

Don't you just hate getting stuck behind a Volkswagen Bus?

40 horses at work.  Please pass.

I may be slow but I'm ahead of you.

Honk if anything falls off.

Don't come knockin' if you see the van rockin'

At least it's paid for.
