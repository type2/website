&gt;Does anyone watch the X-Files out there, On Sunday they showed the Lone
Gunmen(a group of three computer hacks0 driving an old VW bus. I thought it
was pretty cool, and was hoping it would be a splittie, when I first
started seeing it. I then realized it wouldn't work, as teh characters had
to slide the door open quickly, then juump in the side, doesn't work wuite
that smoothly with the double doors on the side.

It would be entirely possible for it to be a split.
