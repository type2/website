Hi Bob,

That has always been my experience as well.  Unless you rear end an 18 wheeler or a school bus, most cars hit far below where the driver sits.  Even the bus that I saw that had rear ended a large pickup (that sat pretty high off the ground) doing 45-55 MPH hit right above the front floor, and caved it in half way to the steering column.  No squashed legs.  Except for having to cut the steering wheel to get the guy out (he was a bit chubby) everyone walked away.   

I have heard stories of these guys (probably yours Bob) once or twice and nothing about them sounds good.

And you sit so 
 far up front in that vehicle that vour knees basically are the front 
bumpers.&quot;

Very amusing -- 'your knees... are the front bumpers.'  

Go measure the height of a front bumper... which is a Federally mandated 
safety issue.  (It will be about 20&quot; above the roadway, depending on 
where/how you measure.)  Then go measure that horribly unsafe old VW bus, the 
FLOOR BOARDS of which are at least 19&quot; above the road.   Now climb in and 
measure the height of your knees.  The figures will vary according to your 
height and type of seat in your bus but in my 1965 VW Microbus my knees are 
approximately forty-three inches above the roadway...  about the same height 
as the middle of the windshield on most cars.

The 'real problem' is not safety.  The real problem is incompetent 'experts'.
