&gt; I've noticed that none of the Vintage Nazis have any criticism for Kyle,
&gt; with his V8 powered Westfailure,

I would not say that at all, it gets plenty. I usually spend extra time at
the gate at shows while they decide if they are going to let me in. At OCTO
they had me park along the fence with the swappers for awhile, at the
Classic they tell me to drop the ABC raffle bus in the show area and go park
the tow vehicle in the lot. At the SOTO meet 3 or 4 years ago this one VN
damn near got a case of the vapors. He covered him little eyes as he walked
by and said &quot;I'm being so good, I'm not even saying anything&quot;. It was
precious. The Westfailure has been around for over twenty years, I am just
the current caretaker. It should not have been done given the condition of
the buses used, and I agree with that, but I'm not going to undo it. If you
want to hack up a bus, just make sure you finish the job. Nothing worse that
a person diving in to the hacking part, then selling all of the parts on
e-Bay when it takes more than planned.
