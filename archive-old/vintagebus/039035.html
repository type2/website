&gt;But my brother says that you can remove the axle
&gt;tubes(redux and all) without tapin' into the breaks. I
&gt;told him he was full of it(he's a bug guy himself). So, 
&gt;can you do this? If so how?  

I assume you've already got an answer to this, but if not, the answer is a
big fat hairy NO.  

I wrote up my tranny pull experience right after I removed it from my 58 sc.
If you (or anyone else) want it, let me know and I'll e-mail it to you since
it's a little too long to post to the list (I tend to be a wordy bastard
once I get going!).
