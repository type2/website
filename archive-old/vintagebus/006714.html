From what Ive seen 62 is a 1 year only walkthrough seat?? Kerry in New
Mexico had these in his DD and they had a weird bracket that mounted to the
side of the pedestal for the seat to slide on (drivers side). Do you have
this bracket also?

Hi all, I have someone intrested in buying a set of walk thru seats that
I have. These are different then the walk thrus seats in my '65. These
came from a '62 panel. These seem to have a lower back, and have a
different set up for the drivers side adjustment. They are somewhat
crusty, and will need to be media blasted and recovered.
  Can someone give me an idea of what they might be worth? I have no
idea how much to ask....BTW, I have a few pics.

TIA

Mike Moore
