Subject: Arizona Bonded Titles

 Just went through this with my 62 panel. Easy process, but getting costly.
All you need is a notorized bill of sale from owner stating they have no title
or reg. or plates and never had any. Next is DMV inspection and NCIC checks to
make sure bus in not stolen. Now the costly part, the bond. DMV now uses the
NADA pricing value book. My panel was marked up in good condition during
inspection.  You now have to get bond for listed value of RESTORED BUS, in my
case they told me $15,000.00.  Low NADA was $9,800.00 and high was $18,000.00
for a panel. Don't now how they come up with these values. The $15,000.00 bond
cost me $225.00. Reg. fees were only $23.50 for 1 year, so total cost was
$248.50.  Took about 2 hours to complete the whole deal, now to get bus
running and to the Red Barn.
