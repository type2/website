was writ&quot;for you to breathe in. if memory serves vwoa had some obscure
&quot;warranty&quot; to exchange these for non aesbestos versions?? mebbe something in
the archives??&quot;

I have heard this mentioned a few times by list memebers...but have never been
able to find full notice of it in the archives, I guess the only route is to
contact VW via email...i assume any local vw dealer will probably give me a
read educated looking stare and try to sell me a new beetle...
