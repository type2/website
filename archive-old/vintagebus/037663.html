Subject: Christmas Bus List Merchandise Right Here!!!

Howdy all...as the holidays draw near, what better time to reward yourself,
your bus, and other loved ones, for being good this year? Of course, the best
way to do this would be to buy a lovely Official List Coffee Mug, or List
stickers. Those of you who have been around a while might remember them, but
all you new folks should definitely jump on the bandwagon and buy some. I've
got about 30 coffee mugs left over from last year, as well as a couple hundred
stickers.
The mugs have a bus from each generation, as in Split, late model, vanagon, and
Eurovan, as well as various historically significant list addresses (meaning
the old V_at_L address, and the type2_dot_com address), and the famous Netvergnugen
label of quality.
Anyway, since I still have a few hundred bucks worth of this stuff, I figured I
would again try to share the joy with the lists. I have also, in the spirit of
Christmas, reduced the prices to $10.00 for the mugs, which includes shipping
and handling, and 5 for $5.00 for the stickers...
Anyway, please buy this stuff, so one day I will have enough money to print
more List T-shirts.
:)
I won't post all the ordering details, but I'll be happy to e-mail them to you.
You can view the design on my website, address below. It's the same design as
the t-shirts.
Anyway, thanks, and Happy Friday.
