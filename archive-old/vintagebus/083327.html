Subject: Big giant pre-Eureka Springs campout party

I am the guy who was telling everyone a few weeks ago about my party in
Arkansas. Well, that one was a test run for Eureka Springs weekend, and it was
terrific. We heard from alot of people who wanted to come in May, but couldn't
work it into their schedules, but said they would be here in August because
they already had put away time for Eureka Springs. Last year we had 10 buses,
I think, and all of them are certainly coming back. So now we could have a
major blowout.

I live just outside Springdale AR, 27 miles, about 40 minutes from the Eureka
Springs show site. I have 8 acres on a 300 foot cliff overlooking Beaver Lake.
I have room for lots and lots of busses with electricity for many air
conditioners and water for all. We have air conditioned room inside the house
for sleepers who don't bring a bus, and a lawn for tent campers. I have 3
showers and will have 2 inside toilets and 2 porta-potties. We are deciding
now what to cook. Whole briskets, a rack of beef ribs, spareribs or half a pig
are the candidates

In May we blew up the biggest fireworks I could buy without a license. We blew
up so many fireworks that somebody across the lake answered with a volley of
their own. We will have many more this time.

You are all invited. So far I know of 10 or so busses and expect many more.
Most of the ones I know of now are from Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. One
is coming from Illinois.  Most people will be arriving around and after noon
and some won't get in until Midnight.

I would appreciate if you all could tell me how many of you  and how many
friends might come so that we will be prepared. It will be big fun.

So put Friday, August 26 on your calendars and c'mon.
