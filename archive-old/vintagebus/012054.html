i posted all of the vws that i own
over half of them run and are registered and insured, the others are in differant stages
of being made runable, the ones that are past fixing are parted out and all parts stored for future use by me or whoever else may need them 
i have parted a lot of buses and bugs but do not waste even a screw, thats why i have a 1500 sq. ft. warehouse full of parts and growing, if you come to  BUSES by the BRIDGE  III, in JANUARY
22-24, 1999 in LAKE HAVASU CITY,AZ. i will be more then happy to show you, who knows i might have that strange part you are looking for.

ronnie  old volks home of az
6 splittys
2 bubbles
