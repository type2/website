Hi, 

I have read that type1's were shipped out CKD (complete knock down) and
assembled in various markets. Were any buses done this way?  I know it seems
unlikley due to the monocoque nature of the bus but it seems odd that all
these Aussie buses are missing something that would tell the factory workers
in Germany what mods (m-codes) to make to a bus for its intended market. 

This could be m-code 0000 : remove m-code plate and ship it to the antipods
:)&gt;
