Subject: engine heating up/timing question

Hi All,
    I have a problem that is driving me nuts....1600 sp motor, has a
UO133XXXX case number so I think it's a type 3 motor. all stock except for a
blue coil, and a 009 distributor. I set the points gap at .016 and checked
it with a dwell meter, right at 50% ...so i think that is good. The problem
is that when the motor has been driven a while it gets pretty hot, and I
think the carb, fuel line is vapor locking. it doesn't want to start when
it's hot. I've tried messing with the timiong and i can make it run cooler
by advancing it ..I think...the timing mark moving clockwise in the timing
lght. , but then it pops and stuff under a load. I've tried setting it at 0,
5, 7.5 and 10 degrees BTC, but it still is getting pretty hot. The John Muir
book shows that motor should be timed at 0 degrees. Does that sound right to
you? It's been really hot here, 100 plus or minus 3 so i know it will get
warm, but i can't pull the dipstick out without burning my fingers. I just
put new pistons and cylinders in this motor ( because the number 3 piston
melted) so I'm trying to avoid doing it again....all of the tin is there. no
thermostat. I need to get one rounded up and will before winter. Any ideas
anyone? Something I'm not checking?
Thanks in advance...or retarded?
Jason
