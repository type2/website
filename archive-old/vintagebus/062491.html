Subject: Re: anti-seize on lug nuts?

&gt;From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;torque wrench and 85 Lbs. torque the lug bolts do not loosen like they used 
&gt;to, but we still check them at about 1/4 mile and five miles after installing 
&gt;wheel/s.

Not arguing here, just amazed at how diff my practices are.  Almost 30 years of ACVW ownership, I've had lug bolts/nuts freeze up (hammered the 
ends or rarely an air wrench to undo) and just ONCE had lug nuts START coming loose -- such a racket I stopped right away -- 400 miles into a 1000 
mile trip on a 71 bus.

My technique?  Snug up the wheel while off the ground, lower car, tighten them in 1-2 passes in a star pattern.  How tight?  Till I grunt.  That's it.  I 
think that's even how the manuals describe it.

Maybe it's the pentagram gesture, huh?  Guardian spirits?  I just don't have lug bolts/nuts back off by themselves, and when I check them, they're 
never loose.  Go figure.

[Yes, I am knocking wood.]
