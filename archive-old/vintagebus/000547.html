&lt;&lt; Hi List, Could someone please tell me if the pass. door on my 62 parts
 bus will fit on my 65? I know the outer door handles are different, so
 will my 65 handle fit on the 62????
  &gt;&gt;

the doors with the pull handles have a differnt latch mechansim and a 
differnt striker plate than the doors with the push button handles. So you 
can use the other type of door if you want to mangle the other kind of 
striker plate onto there, but I recommend finding another push button handle 
door for your 65.
