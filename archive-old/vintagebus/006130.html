&gt; Heard a rumor around that a 1957 Binz is up for sale.  Any body know if
this
&gt; is true or not?
&gt;
There's one in the type2_dot_com classifieds for $9950.  From talking with the
current owner and others who have seen it, that is *at least* 3x it's value.

I am currently looking for one and have placed several wanted ads on the
'net.
