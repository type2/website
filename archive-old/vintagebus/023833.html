Subject: correct gear oil

I have been searching the archives and talking with local stores about
the correct hypoid gear oil to place in my redux boxes and the tranny.
I have come to the conclusion that a 80W90 hypoid gear oil is ok to
use.  The only factor I can not seem to find is an oil that has a rating
of GL4.  The types I have been finding have a rating of GL3/4/5 or ones
that claim to be a GL5 or better.  I have talked SEVERAL local parts
departments and they said that the GL rating was not important.  One
mechanic said that as you go higher in numbers, the better the
&quot;protection&quot;.  Some one on the archives said that this was not the case
about higher is better.    Muchas Gracias.
