&gt; During my 4 month honeymoon VW bus trip, I

Auto Zone, checker, advance auto parts, most service stations,  and
pep-boys, and pretty much any auto store like that will take your used
oil.

My long trip oil change.
1) pull into auto zone
2) change oil.
3) pour used oil into jars that new oil came out of.
4) take jars into store and have recycled.

You could probably just take the drain pan in and dump it that way (they
have a big vat of oil you just dump yours into)

take care,

Steve
