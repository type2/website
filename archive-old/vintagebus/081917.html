Subject: Splitty on Pimp My Ride Sun night

Hi  :-), I just saw the ad on MTV for the Pimp My Ride featuring a Splitty, Sun night at 9PM......Darn, they took my idea, I've been an adict to the show and had been thinking about trying to contacting them about my hurt up bus..........But should be alot of fun to watch.......they usually do a nice job with the cars that are on it...... :-) 
 
enjoy,
peace,
Tracy
