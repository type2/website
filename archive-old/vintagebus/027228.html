Subject: Tampa Area Listees?

Hey Y'all!

Kelli and I are going to be in Tampa FLA visiting my pop from Friday
thru the following Thursday. Gonna do Busch Gardens on Tues or Weds.
Maybe the beach one day also. Weekend is kinda full already , but would
love to meet any list people, maybe get a cup of coffee, see the local
bus scene?... Sadly, we are flying, so are stuck driving dad's Japanese
sports car....
