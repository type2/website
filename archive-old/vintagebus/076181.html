Subject: Re: hing

On Thu, 11 Sep 2003 22:48:44 EDT, Bobs67bus_at_wmconnect_dot_com asked:

&gt;&gt;both screw holes are stripped out on the bottom left hinge piller
where the 
&gt;&gt;cargo door goes. how can this be fixed. 

Are you sure the holes are stripped? It could be that the threaded
plate inside the door post has fallen inside the post.  They're made to
slide around inside the post for adjustment of the door.  

It's easy to lose one inside the post when both screws are removed and
the plate doesn't stick to the post.  If that's what happened to you,
that plate needs to be fished out of the bottom of the post and brought
back up to align with the hinge screws.  Easier said than done (without
cutting a hole in the post).

Any listees have a sure fire way to retrieve that threaded plate?
