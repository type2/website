&gt;We finally got out an old
&gt;thermometer I had with the dual scales on it and we soon &gt;established
common
&gt;ground. :-)  We just ballparked at the km/mileage ratio. :-)

I have just bought a 66 kombi, In Oz we changed to metric from Imperial
about then, and my bus has a &quot;Volkswagen approved accessory&quot; stuck over the
speedo. Clear plastic with Kilometres in black. A bit wierd, but I like it.
