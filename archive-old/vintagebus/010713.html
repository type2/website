&gt;  Hey all,
&gt;  
&gt;  I have been looking for replacement Rack clamps such as these that Lenny
&gt;  from West Coast Classic's has on a certain evil auction site.

&gt;  
&gt;  Does anyone know of a re-seller that might carry these?
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks
&gt;  Chris

I used turnbuckles from the hardware store for the rack on my 61 15 window.  
may not be good enough for those with decorative fashion plate racks on froo 
froo shiny buses, but they work.  use an angle grinder to cut one hook so it 
slips unde rthe rain gutter, attach and tighten down, and you are good to go.
