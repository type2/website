This morning I took a delivery to the local park where 2 new picnic shelters
are being built.  While I was there with my workmate Brian Eppens, I was
explaining to him about what a Jeans Beetle was.  There is a guy that lives
within sight of where I was in the park and for the longest time, he's had a
lime green beetle in black trim (instead of chrome) sitting in his driveway.
He's one of those old guys that says, &quot;No, it ain't fer sale - I'm gonna fix
'er up.&quot; - and of course, there it sits.

Anyway, as I'm explaining the features of the Jeans Bug to Brian, I tell him
that one of the features of the interior was that the seats were done in
denim and right then I instantly stopped because I had just given myself the
perfect idea on what to use for covering my parcel tray with.  I have a
bunch of old overalls that I've been saving for rags (I split the crotches
out) and in the spirit of thriftyness plus my loving of interiors done in
denim, I've finally figured out what I'm going to cover my parcel tray
with - old overall denim.  What a perfect idea!!!
