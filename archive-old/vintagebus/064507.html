Sounds like you need a gas cap that is vented&gt;  Problem solved.  Or a rag!

Subject: [VB] Gas Tank Suck


&gt; OK, I currently have my engine and gas tank out of my 71 to fix my second
gas
&gt; tank leak in 8 months! (Replaced old tank with current tank in March of
this
&gt; year)
&gt; Where the tank is leaking this time, it almost looks like the tank wall
has
&gt; buckled from suction inside the tank (picture a beer can that has been
pushed
&gt; in a bit on the side).  This led me to re-consider a few things that have
been
&gt; happening in my Westy. First of all, while camping a few months ago I hear
a
&gt; sound coming from the tank area, like a gurgling sound, continued all
night.
&gt; Engine is off and I'm trying to sleep. I hear this sound on other
occasions
&gt; after parking the bus. Secondly, I have been noticing air pockets in my
fuel
&gt; line and specifically, the clear fuel filter actually runs dry sometimes
while
&gt; driving. Thirdly, everytime I fill up with gas, the gas cap really hisses
alot
&gt; when I take it off due to suction inside the tank.
&gt; So what the hell?  Should my fuel tank really be so air tight that the
fuel
&gt; being pumped out of it is creating a suction inside the tank enough to
suck in
&gt; the walls and account for my multiple leaks? Is the tube coming out of the
top
&gt; of the tank and going up into the side vent area suposed to be a breather
line
&gt; to relieve such suction?  Or have I just had bad luck developing these 2
leaks
&gt; in eight months with no real cause??
&gt; Here I sit with my engine on the floor anxiously awaiting advice from the
wise
&gt; ones...
