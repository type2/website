Clara:
Thanks for the moral support, it's important too.
I am going to stop on the way home this afternoon and get one of those 8mm
square sockets.
BTW: since the last post I managed to twist off the head of the screw
holding the front and rear shift rods together, guess I'll be drilling that
out while I'm under there.

I really don't want to have to pull the motor and trans out to do this.
John
