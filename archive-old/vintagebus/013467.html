Hi Joe,

I would suggest flying into Phoenix, since Flagstaff is pretty small (well not really any more, but the airport is).  The caravan to the show is ususally quite impressive and it leaves from Phoenix.  I'm sure we can find you someone to ride up with.  You could go with me if you wanted, and I could even loan you a tent for the weekend.  If all works out and I have multiple buses insured again by then, I might even be able to loan you a splittie for the weekend.  I have had friends drive up my extra buses in the past to increase the already large bus count.  There have been at least 3 years where I have had 2 of my buses at the show.  Let me know.

Richard
