Subject: Re: [VB] Bug or Bus 36hp engine?

Things had this feature to compliment the 'ruggedness' of them - you
could get yourself out of a jam with a dead battery by crank starting
it.  The thing nuts are slightly different than the bug and bus ones,
though.

&gt;  yes it came on the vw things,

&gt;  
&gt; How could that be? Things were only imported for the years 1973 and 1974, 
&gt; which is
&gt; a far cry from 1959-1960, or whatever the years are.
