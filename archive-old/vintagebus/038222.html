&lt;&lt;I am not accustomed to
the sounds I hear coming from this little VW engine during higher
revs.  It seems that if I follow the shifting guidelines I get
this -flat- kind of sound and I think I'm about to blow something up.&gt;&gt;

Michele,
As Obi-wan once said &quot;reach out with your feelings and let the force
flow through you&quot;  Forget what all of the books say and listen to your
Bus when driving.  Your bus will speak volumes to you when you know what
it is saying.
Go to an empty parking lot and try driving around shifting at different
speeds and sounds.  When you hear that just right sound, right when the
gears hit rpm and the bus feels smooth on you back, shift.  You can feel
it when they hit RPM.  I would even suggest you do this at night so your
brain has less clutter to deal with, your eyes will decieve you.
Oh, if you feel you must rely on a book, remember the shift points they
refer to are for when you are driving on flat level pavement.

&lt;&lt;I want to make sure I'm not tearing up my engine. &gt;&gt;
Remember, it takes a LOT of deliberate abuse to destroy a bus tranny. So
don't worry to much.

Drive by the seat of your pants, and
may the Volks be with you.
