&lt;&lt; Hi all,
 I've never taken one apart before, but what exactly is the difference
 between 65 and 66 wiper shafts?  is it longer, shorter, fatter? If it's
 just a question of length, it seems to me it wouldn't be too difficult
 to tweak a 66 repo one to work in the 65.
 Just my uninformed opinion.
 Jon 65 standard  wiper shafts with very chewed up ends.
  &gt;&gt;
the shaft itself seems the same diameter and length, but the flat bit at the 
end towards the bus that has the pin for the linkage to attach to is a 
differnt length.  

perhaps the flat ends could be swapped?   if you want to get a repro and do 
it, please post to the list how it works, wiper shafts get trashed quick.
