&lt;&lt; The m-code plate on my '65 Single says it was made on 83 8. When put
 into Thoms registry I am told it was made on the 83rd day of August,
 yeah right........ What's does this mean??
  &gt;&gt;
well, it SHOULD read DAY-MO

so the 83rd of august sounds right- are you sure you copied it right- maybe 
it was buildt late on a Friday and they were already drinking.
