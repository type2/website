I have located a front brushgaurd for a bus. The seller and I don't know
what it is worth. It is straight and just needs blasted and painted.
It's the kind that comes up and over the headlights. Any idea what it is
worth?? Does anyone know if they made rear ones too?


Everett's page has pictures of both. No idea on price. Whatever you can buy
them for, I guess.
