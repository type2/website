Subject: [VB] aluminum filler (was: bodywork question)
Message-ID: &lt;0.b93a03a3.25471b1b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt; On top of all of those options, why don't you try using aluminum filler? 
Made
&gt; of real aluminum, and polymers. Sands smooth, bonds like only a metal can 
and
&gt; takes paint like a pro!

What product are you refering to?  Lab-Metal (one part product) or aluminum 
fillers added to poyester resin (two part products - three with the aluminum 
filler - like West System with 420 Aluminum Powder among many others)?  I 
would agree that aluminum in body fillers probably would add strength to the 
cured material (making it more machinable) and add protection from UV.  I 
wonder if it actually makes the bond to the substrate better.  The only thing 
I see doing bonding is a mechanical bond of the polyester resin to the 
substrate (which, granted, is pretty strong).  Perhaps the aluminum adds some 
chemical bonding (I am skeptical) or perhaps the aluminum makes the 
mechanical bond of the polyester resin stonger?  Perhaps I am not refering to 
the product you use.
