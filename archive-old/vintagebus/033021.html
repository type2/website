want to have to pound these guys into submission for fear of doing something 
I might not be able to fix.&gt;&gt;
Hi Christopher,
Well make sure to remove all of the reduction box bolts that hold the two 
halfs together.  Then install the 17mm allen wrench in the upper fill plug.  
Rap on the wrench with a hammer until you see the halfs crack apart.  Repeat 
the same with the bottom plug, and work back and forth between them to keep 
things even.  In extreme cases we will use a hammer and round punch in the 
two areas that will not damage the sealing surfaces of the case halfs.  Most 
likely the reason for the reduction case halfs not coming apart easily is 
that the lower out bearing is too tight on the axle.  You might want to 
lightly polish the surface of the axle where the bearing sits when you have 
it off.  Use 400 and higher sandpaper for this and make sure not to over do 
it since this has to be a press on fit.  
&lt;&lt;Oh yeah, I haven't fully removed them off the Arms yet. &gt;&gt;
Hmm, Unless you are removing the tranny or have the 1964-67 later reduction 
boxes you should not need to remove them from the swing plates.   Eric&amp;Barb
