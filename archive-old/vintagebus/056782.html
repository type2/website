&gt; OK, It's almost in. When I pulled it, my last mechanic only put in 3 of the 
&gt; 4 bolts. He left out the one above the clutch. Now I have the motor back in 
&gt; place, the two lower studs with nuts on them. How do you get to the bolt 
&gt; above the starter? All I feel from the top is a hole, and can't get to 
&gt; above the starter from down below. 

Hi Raymond,
First the two upper engine to tranny mounting bolts are above the clutch.  Do 
you mean the one above the clutch cable arm?  To get to the one above the 
starter one just reaches over the top of the tranny to push it into its hole.
