&gt; &gt; Has anyone had to adjust the door gaps on a Bus?  &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dave
&gt; &gt;
&gt; all final door adjustment i have done on buses required the bending of the union
&gt; of the door and its hinge. or bending of the union of the pillar and the hinge.
&gt; the decision of which to bend varies from bus to bus. i prefer the door in most
&gt; cases as i have a unsubstancated fear or damaging the pillar

Ahh yes good point. The hinge mounting to the doors is a weak spot
subject to cracking and bending. I think there is a section in bentley(?)
about repairing and reinforcing cracked hinges.
