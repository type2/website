  I know, it does seem to technophobic for a vintage bus list, but since
we are in the age of convergence; does anyone have any experiance with
dishes, providers, installation...I know with some Sat TV providers, you
need a telephone line connected and some you don't.  The 18&quot; dish is the
craze now, better smaller than larger of the past.

Best,
