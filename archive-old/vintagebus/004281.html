Hey NQ,

I think that those steering wheel spinners are illegal in most states unless
you're somehow disabled.  I had one of these on a non-VW in high school and
got a ticket for having it on my steering wheel.  The state trooper said
that only handicapped people were allowed to have them installed in
passenger vehicles, and tractor trailers were allowed to have them as well.
I'd check it out to be on the safe side.  As for those horn button clocks,
sign me up!  They sound cool and inexpensive!

Paul

Also have some of the steering wheel spinners with the VW logo inside.
Have one on my bus and just love it for whipping around those corners.
I mounted mine on the upper top so that when I'm driving straight it's
out of the way, got about 5 of those too.  My buddy told me it should
have a pinup girl in it, but don't think the wives would appreciate it
as much as he seemed to think.
