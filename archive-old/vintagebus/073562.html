Don't worry, we won't tell her!  This brings up a somewhat interesting
topic.  First I must say all SINGLE people and people who do this (bus
business) for a living should delete, as you have no insight to what its
like to live with busses and someone who views them a yard waste. 

Many out there profess to have an understanding SO but in reality there
is a limit to the amount of VWness the SO can stand. I've been on this
list long enough (5+ years) to have seen many a bus person dispose of
busses unwontedly and even relationships dissolve over the ownership of
said.  Lets face it MOST SO's hate these things.

So, do you married people have a limit to owning busses, going to shows,
swaps, et. al??  Be honest.  Eric and Barb and Philip and Kathryn are
the exceptions that prove the rule.

BTW today I'm missing a favorite show (Bob Baker) to organize my/our
office.  Give and take people.  I understand Don ;-)
