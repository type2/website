Hi Volks,
In our 700+ mile trips to Sacramento and back to the Seattle area over the 
years has resulted in the following MPG average results in our 1960 panel 
camper conversion with 3.875R&amp;P freeway flier and 1641 SP with CW crank 
running 7.1:1 CR while doing about 63 MPH by the speedo.  With checking our 
odometer against highway mile markers we have to travel 102 miles by the 
odometer to do 100 real miles.  This should result in a reduction of .5 miles 
off each of the following figures if our math is correct.
Spring 1997 25.5975 MPG
Fall 1997  23.63133
Spring 1998  24.20484 MPG
We use 87 octane up here in the NW except when traveling in 80+ F weather and 
especially while traveling with a heavy cargo loads uphills.  Using the 
midrange fuel seems to drop the oil temp about 10F which has been helping us 
keep the oil temps below 220F.  So we have been fueling up at Ashland Ore. 
with midrange octane and keep fueling up with midrange octane fuel to 
Sacramento and back to Ashland Ore. part of the trip.   Eric&amp;Barb
