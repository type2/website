Hi all,

This has a low bus content, but it shows that the classics are still
around and patience pays off.  Happy hunting.

Well evidently the middle of November is the best time to find a new
ride. While my score wasn't as great as Thom and Tom's, but I'm happy
with it.  The day I lost a decent Notch in Kansas to somebody in
Colorado, I ran across a 1957 oval sitting in my bosses neighbors front
drive way.  I ended up talking to him later that afternoon and learned
he was the original owner, the car had the original engine (not frozen)
and interior and that about 5 years ago, he bought $1000 worth of parts
to restore it.  Well after very little haggling, and a bit of
inspection, I got it.  It's all there, from trim to horn button.  The
pile of parts includes two NOS wiper motors, a ton of trim and rubber,
new hub caps, everything to make this thing a beauty.  The body is in
great shape, with a little surface rust here and there.  The seats are
in great shape with no tears and some sunning on the drivers and
passanger seat. The floor pan is incredible.  There isn't a mark,
scratch, or even a hint of rust on it.  The old guy I bought it from
bought it from a dealer here in the states and picked it up in Germany,
so in with the original owners manual where some volkswagen production
maps of all kinds of countries in Europe.  All of this and a couple days
to work on it and get it out of there for $1750 with the original key
that fits everything.

I love California.  Oh yeah, this was found in San Diego in the El Cajon
hills.

Bus Content.  My garage is full with two busses, so Dad gets this one to
play with and put back together.

Thanks for reading.
Aaron
