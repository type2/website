What worked best for me was grinding a flat face, or two on the metal tube that was left behind.  then liquid wrench and vise grips, and with the flat spots the vise grips catch and spin the tube, rather than spinning around the tube.  worked for me at least.

&lt;&lt; Whoa - are those things on there!

Anyway,  I'm trying to replace my front shocks and I've got em off but I'm
having problems with the metal sleeve or bushing or whatever that thing is
the goes between the rubber and the lower stud/bolt.  The rubber thing and
the whole shock came off but the metal sleeve stayed behind.  I've tried
heat and wd-40 does anyone have any other ideas?  Should I just get out the
grinder and grind it off?
