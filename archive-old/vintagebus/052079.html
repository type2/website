&gt;I came across some information about emergency brake cable problems with

They don't fit! I got the later ones that work with the big nut tranny and 
cut them on the &quot;lever&quot; end to the right length. I then installed those 
cable shortener ends like the dune buggy guys use. Supposedly not the 
safest method, but has worked great for me. Works tons better than 
nothing...and if you keep an eye on things every now and then, I don't see 
a problem. Others may say diiffrent, but my personal real world experience 
is that it works good, is affordable, and easily done.
