George and List,
As I understand it, Alan Schofield makes the highest quality replacement metal
parts available for our vans.  But he does not sell in the US market.  Das
Bulli imports from Alan.  Das Bulli are a total pain in the ass so Ronnie of
&lt;A HREF=&quot;www.type2parts_dot_com&quot;&gt;Old Volks Home&lt;/A&gt; (www.type2parts_dot_com) has
started importing from Alan to give us a reliable source of the superior
Schofield metal.  He is a listmember and I will be using him instead of Das
Bulli from now on.  His email is ronnie_at_ctaz_dot_com if you need to contact him or
you can just go to his site which is show above.  List, please correct me if
any of my information is incorrect.
