Hi Volks,
Hmm, too bad there is no return Email address!  We tried to send the below 
with no luck.

&gt;&gt;http://142.165.166.229/vw/Van/ NO clue as what year or make.  You tell me.  
No 
&gt; engine

Hi Tony,
1963-67 Baja bug, with Eberspacher gas heater.

Type 3 engine missing FW and alot of cooling tin.

1956-57 Oval window bug.

Loooks like a late 55-early half of 58 bus.

As far as what it is worth depends on total condition and how far you take it 
to sell.  At worse you have alot of good parts to use or sell.
