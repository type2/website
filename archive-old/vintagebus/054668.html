Subject: RE: [VB] mats, VWOA, NOS, blah blah blah

You people have to realize that VWOA is trying to protect (legally) their
name and symbols.  If a part is repoped, it should definitely NOT be marked
exactly as an original... that's a fake... the people making the part should
have enough pride in their company to put their name on it if there is to be
any type of 'name' on it.  Putting the part number on it is ok, as long as
it doesn't have the name or symbol.

Trust me here... I've collected lots of different items from people claiming
to be NOS and more than half is either &quot;*new* NOS&quot; which has both the VW and
Audi symbols on it or it has no marks at all.  I'm getting to the point that
I would prefer to find nice/perfect used pieces of a bus being parted than
find NOS... more times than not you can be more sure of it's origins.

In the end, if it's repoped, it really shouldn't have the vw symbol on it...
learn to understand that!

Is this because of VWOA? I think that is ridiculous,
if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe they
should get in the business.
