Subject: Re: [VB] clunking sound from fan

&gt; 1.  Did I miss something in the diagnosis I've done so far?
&gt; 2.  Is there anything else to try with the engine in?

Reach around front and try to wiggle the fan both side to side and
forward-backwards. Engine off of course. Then take the belt off and try it
again while holding the pulley. Generator/alternator bearings might be shot,
woodruff keys wallered, nut loose, etc. Check for rags or paper towels in
the fan while you're back there. Gotta keep looking.
