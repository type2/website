I know this doesn't directly help you but I've had great succes lifting bugs and
busses with a fork lift with extensions while at a friend's house.  When a
proper lift isn't available this is a great back and work saver when working
under a bus.  It's also a great way to power wash underneath a vehicle without
messing up a shop.
We place steel 55 gals drums under the forks to guard against a hydraulic
collapse.
