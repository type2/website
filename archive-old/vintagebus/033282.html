&lt;&lt; . Recently I thought it would be interesting to pinpoint MPG in order to 
see how effective my tune-ups are.&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Using MPG info and noticing a drop in it we have several times discovered a 
leaky fuel pump diaphram, carb shutoff float valve or just the need to tune 
things up has caused the drop in MPG.
 
&lt;&lt;In order to be accurate there are some issues that must be addressed.&gt;&gt;
Accuracy is good, but just like any pressure or temp gauge if it is off a bit 
does not really matter in the long run.  It is rather the sudden change or 
even the noticable change over time from normal that can be noticed due to 
keeping track of it.
 
&lt;&lt;1) Exactly how much gas am I using? Assuming the gas pump is ACCURATELY 
telling me how much I have pumped I can start there. I filled up the bus to a 
notable point in the filler neck and noted the odometer reading. Upon my next 
fill up (which I hope will be in about 250 statute miles) I will fill up to 
the same point noting amount put in the tank and current odometer reading. A 
little math and I have my MPG, right?&gt;&gt;
Yes, you minus the previous odometer reading from the last one and then 
divide the result by the fuel amount of the last fill up.
 
&lt;&lt;2) Is my odometer reading true? I don't think so. I am currently running 
14/185/70 which is undersized in comparison to the original tires to which I 
assume the odometer/speedometer is calculated. I do not know how to correct 
for tire size. Is there a simple factor I can plug in?  &gt;&gt;
Georges explaination is good, but if you want really accurate results do the 
same testing over at least 100 miles or better yet 200 or more miles.  Since 
the standard VW speedo does not have tenths of a mile the longer test milage 
the better.   Eric&amp;Barb
