my 66 so44 has square handles. the liftup sink cover has a square
/buttonless/ handle. (horizontal)

The icebox door, otoh, has a grey late style handle on it...but I suspect
this was a replacement a few years down the road...with three of these
things all in a row, they are real easy to break. (how do I know, you
might ask..weeeeelll!)


anyway.  thats what i know.  and dont ya'll forget...late models used
black handles. at least my 69 did. same shape wrong color! :)
