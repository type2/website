Hi All!
I couldn't believe my eyes as I was flipping through the pages of the
Sept. issue of the DuPont Registry---right there in the middle of 6
vintage Mercedes and a Saleen Mustang (pg.148) , there sat a VW Double
Cab!!! Now if THAT isn't moving up in the world, I don't know what is!
:-) No price, I guess if you have to ask you can't afford it? I know I
can't!   The showroom has a website, might be able to see the Bus
there. It's http://www.showroomcars_dot_com in San Jose, CA, in case
your'e interested!  Have a GREAT day, and great to see the bus mail
back online!
