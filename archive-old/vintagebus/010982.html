&gt;  &lt;&lt; I iwll have to check the page, it is in the tran removal section stating
&gt;   &quot;the main driveshaft must be supported when tran is on ground&quot;, and thyey
&gt;   recommend a block of wood. I am just trying to be certain I won't break
&gt;   anything by placing this trans, assembled with rgbs in my truck for
&gt;   transport for 5 some hours.&gt;&gt;
&gt;  
no problem to transport it in truck, with tranny flat.  yes, if bell housing 
is pointed down, use wood or something so the weight is not on the axle 
shaft.  or things may get all messed up inside.  just leave the outer clamps 
on the boots loose until you install the tranny.  make sure the screw bits 
point down for easy removal (at some future date when the boots go bad) with 
the engine installed.  fill with oil with tranny in bus, before installing 
engine.



&gt;  Shimming between the axle tube and the tranny center section is really 
easy 
&gt;  and quick to do.  It is the crown gears to the fulcrum plates and upper 
axle 
&gt;  shove handles that takes time and often spare and new parts to get right,  
but 
&gt;  that can be done way before your trip.  The worse time consuming thing you 
&gt;  can do is to put the RGBs on the wrond sides!  


er- I saw someone put two left RGBs on a tranny.  duh.  no it wasn't me, I 
wish I had taken a picture.

&gt;   
&gt;  &lt;&lt;On another note, replacement of my spring plates is necc. Adjustment and 
&gt;  install have me slightly stumped. I understand I must mount the spring 
&gt; plates 
&gt;  ahead of tranaxle install? Is adjustment only possible then with 
&gt;  transaxle/rgbs attached to spring plates? If I have to press the plate 
onto 
&gt;  the torsion bar, with the long bolts/cover, how to I effectively adjust 
this,
&gt;  remove, move, install, measure, move, rinse, repeat? Therfore, I must 
avoid 
&gt;  an intital install of the spring plate on the lower stop? It seems that I 
&gt;  have the option of installing the spring plate in various positions on the 
&gt;  torsion arm to begin with, does this matter in the adjustment process? Is 
it
&gt;  possible to get adjusted or close with the trans NOT installed? This step 
&gt;  confuses me, mostly since I have never done it. I have the tool to 
compress 
&gt;  the plate upward on the way, but for beyond the removal process, I am 
&gt;  stumped.&gt;&gt;

you do this with RGBoxes NOT attached.
you need an angle finder, check the angle between the spring plate and the 
bus.   then you need to check the book (bentley) to find the correct andle.  
the splines on the torsion bar and the splines on the Spring Plates each have 
different degrees.  Remove the covers and mark where they are now.  are they 
ion the right places?  How are the SPs bad?  some lowering junk?  anyway, you 
do the math and figure out which needds to be turned what way.  it may be one 
notch counter clockwise on the torsion bar, then two to the right on the 
spring plate, or some such.  you have to be very careful to know how many 
notches you are turning what, but the procedure is simple.  and as the tranny 
is already out of the way, should not take long.

I have only done this twice, a few years ago, but it was no big deal.

&gt;  &gt;&gt;Rancho then ships the rgbs apart, and the axles are attached by moi to 
&gt;  trans, the tubes (attached to rgbs) are placed on axles, insert bearing, 
&gt;  clip, assemble boxes? Just trying to be best prepared for this process.&lt;&lt;
&gt;  

read the bently several times, till you are familiar with the process.  Once 
thing you MUST do is install BOTH inner bearings before you install the stub 
axle.  if you do not install the upper inner bearing before the stub axle, 
you will find that you have to remove the stub axle to install that bearing, 
which really is a PITA if you already put the nut and plug on.   This is very 
important.

&gt;     Clara has a 1600 with a 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier tranny and she does not 
&gt;  have the power we have with our setup.  Her engine has an uneven running 
&gt;  feeling also.  We wonder if installing a CW would help her alot.

ya, but that's the exhaust leaks :(.  thing is I swapped that same motor  
from the 65 with 3.88r&amp;p, 1.26 RGBs and 26&quot; tires into my 61 and it has LOADS 
of zip, and pulls hills.  4.37 r&amp;p with 1.26 RGBs and 27&quot; tires on 15&quot; rims 
(*early 64 gearing*) does 58mph at 3K rpm by its speedo with all 4 tires the 
same.    I can pull it up to 70mph really quickly to avoid getting squashed 
by a semi, if need be.   on the way back from Puyallup what you said was 60 
on your  speedo was 55 on my speedo (my speedo does read low),    I also 
passed you going up out of the Nisqually Delta, which implies to me that 
perhaps that though you have more flat power, my 61 has more hill power.

The 65 may weigh more with all that camper stuff, but that 3.88/1.26 gearing 
somehow requires more power.  It'll get there, but just does not have the 
power to happily go up Harrison Hill in 3rd.    The thing I just dont 
understand is that that 4th tachs exactly the same in both, but it would 
probably be best to check both speedos against a GPS, or against something.  
It really diminished my faith in all that gearing math that people do.    Ya, 
the 1679 is my theory for that 65 bus.    The thing is I feel I'm still in 
the experimental stage, and due to budget restraints am tempted to use the 
parts I have, a nice standard standard crank et al.   But no hurries, no 
worries.
