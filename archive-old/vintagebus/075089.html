Subject: RE: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?

  Automatic trans fluid poured slowly down the carb at 2000 rpms will clean
all the carbon build up off the valves and pistons. Just SMOKES a lot, watch
out that somebody doesn't call the fire department.

ps. Got really greasy hands, wash them with ATF, works better then soap!

Subject: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?


Somebody mentioned this in a forum, and I was wondering if any of you had
ever heard of it being performed.  If you slowly drop water down your carb
while your engine is running, it will slowly &quot;steam clean&quot; your pistons,
cylinders, heads, and exhaust.  Has anybody on the list done this before?
Did it work?  What was the procedure?
