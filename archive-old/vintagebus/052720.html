Subject: 15&quot; tires on '66 Westi ?

What is the tire of choice for the 15&quot; rim these days?

I am thinking I can shoehorn a 215/75R15 on there and fit in the rear?  Or
do I have to be more conservative and go with a 205/70R15 (stock diameter).

Here is the situation.  I have traded a few parts to get a set of 15&quot;x6&quot;
Porsche Fuchs wheels and want to fit them on the bus.  I will do the Porsche
944 brake upgrade in the front from Old Speed and then just run aluminum
adaptors in the rear (should be safe for a slow bus).

After checking out Tire Rack online I cannot find the tried and true tires
that everyone used to love like the Yoko 360Y and Bridgestone one...  Some
people swear by the Michelins, but I think they are a rip-off for what you
get and westfalia_dot_org says the LTX is not made for the bus anyway.

Here is what I have found:
Pirelli Scorpion S/T for $74 a pop.

Look at that load rating for the &quot;C&quot; tire!

What do you all think?


Thanks,
