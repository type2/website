Subject: Melted Coil!

Hey All,

Broke down on lunch Friday and managed to roll into a import garage.  Was 
gonna get dharged to leave it there but a cool mechanic said he could 
probably hook me up with a used working coil and charge me the minimum labor 
rate.  So cool I was thinking I needed to replace my coil anyway.  Well 
spent $50 and was on my way.  My 66 Deluxe drove great 15miles on the way 
home.  Saturday went to start him and just got a click (have a brand new 
battery).  Looked at the engine and black plastic lookin like wax is melted 
all over my fuel filter and fan shroud.  What could cause a coil to melt.  
Was it just faulty.  My bus is coverted to 12v... could it be a 6v coil.  
Hoping I can get my cash back a my a new coil and have some change.  Can 
this happen again with a new coil.  My plug wires are brand new.

Thanks,

Eric
66 Deluxe
