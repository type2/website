Hello all!

Here's a couple of links to stories about the Firestone tires.
The models affected are the ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness tires.
Sears (US retail chain) has quit selling these models of tires
until they hear more from Bridgestone/Firestone (same company).
The NHTSA (US highway safety agency) has an investigation underway.

AP story:
http://dailynews.yahoo_dot_com/h/ap/20000804/us/tire_deaths_11.html

Reuters story:
http://dailynews.yahoo_dot_com/h/nm/20000804/bs/sears_tires_dc_6.html

Both stories mention heat as a problem; they say there have been
more problems in southern US states and the AP also mentions
problems in Central America.

http://www.firestone_dot_com/news/consumer/news/00724a.html
http://www.firestone_dot_com/news/newsmain_ATX.html

I can't find much info about it on the NHTSA site
http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/ , but it is case number PE00-020 .

Tirerack_dot_com lists the ATX/ATXII in 205, 215, 225, 235, and 265
/75R15 and 235/75SR15 .  They have the Wilderness HT in SR14:
195/75, 205/75, and 225/70, and in SR15: 215/65, 225/75, and
225, 235, and 255 /70.  Finally, they show the Wilderness AT/
AT I/AT II in 215, 225, and 235 /75SR15.

From looking through the &quot;tire&quot; articles in the library at
type2_dot_com, it looks like only the 195 and 205 versions of the
above tires are likely to be found on a Bus.
