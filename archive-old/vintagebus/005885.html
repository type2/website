&gt; For those of you that saw Eddie at the Octo show in October (I think) and
saw
&gt; how freaking OLD he looked, I heard today that he's having a birthday
today
&gt; and he's turning............(drumroll)...........46.
&gt;
&gt; 46?!?!  I would have bet big $ that he was well on his way to 60 based on
his
&gt; looks that day
&gt;
&gt; Poor Eddie...............hopefully his new bus (if he bought one) well
help
&gt; him age a bit better.
