Subject: Front Inner wheel bearings, what is going on?

What is the deal with front inner wheel bearings not going on or coming off? I figured something was
messed up but then I spoke to a supplier and he said &quot;oh yah, early bearings are always a  bitch to
get on, then you have to cut them off or destroy them getting them off&quot;. That doesn't seem right to
me. I dont recall having any of these troubles last time on my 57, and I know when i first pulled
the drums off of my 58 after it had sat for 40 years, they came off without trouble.  But the new
ones would not go on, and then once I finally basically got them pressed on, they would not come off
next time i pulled the drum off (stayed on with the seal). I used a puller to remove them this time,
but it screws up the cage by the time you get it off. So i went and bought new bearings, but same
problem, wont go on, wont come off. Surely your not supposed to trash inner wheel bearings everytime
you want to go in the drum to have a look? I measured the OD  of the spindle and the ID of the new
bearings with calipers, and according to what im getting they are both the identical same size. That
doesn't seem right, wheres the clearance? All bearings used so far have been FAG with the &quot;Germany&quot;
stamping on them. There are no nicks or scratches on the spindle, it is well greased and all that.
Anyone have any insight on this problem or is this normal to everyone else?

Thanks
