&gt; I once hit 60 when I wasn't paying attention.
&gt; It does 48 mph real nice.
&gt;

well, it's not a barndoor ('60 double cab), its not friday but this has a little
more to do with busses than download speed so...

86.9 MPH (gps confirmed) on the flats, no wind, no down hill between fresno &amp;
bakersfield

I had room to go faster with the engine, but the needle was wrapped around to
zero and thought that would be a good point to stop the madness.  Once I get the
right size tires on the front, the zero mark should be a few mph higher.  (maybe
90?)
