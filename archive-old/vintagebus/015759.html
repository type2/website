There is really only one root source for the harnesses, and the mail
order supply houses buy from him.

I put one in the '55, and it's very nice.  I had to strip each
and every dang wire end, because the '55 used screw terminals, but
it worked out OK.

Print out a wiring diagram, in color if you can.  It will be infinitely
helpful when you're trying to get everything connected.

&gt; What should I watch out for?  How much of a pain is this to do?  How
&gt; much time should I expect it to take?
&gt; How do i go about running the harness through to the back of the bus?
&gt; There is a tube or something that runs through the frame...correct?
