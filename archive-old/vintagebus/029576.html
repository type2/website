I had a friend who kept getting the tail lights stolen off of his driver 60 bug.
He ended up zapping a bead of weld in the screw head on each light.  He said he
never wanted them the come off anyway.

I do this to my vintage plates.  I use  slightly longer than needed screw/bolts
and after they are all snugged up good I zap a small bead of weld on the
screw/bolt.  I make sure there is enough bolt to make cutting it off with a die
grinder and cut off wheel possible if I need to.  This makes it impossible to get
the nut off with out a cutoff wheel or dremmel tool.  I figure this will be too
much work for the average punk ass thief (which BTW there were plenty of at Pomona
today) and no big deal if I need to take them off someday.
