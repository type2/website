Subject: Re: [VB] nos 36hp case 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It wasnt too many years ago that there was an auction
in California at which Dave Heard and others bought
NOS cases for something like $25 each because no one
was interested in them. It was reported in Hot VWs and
on the old Lenti email list. Do any of the old timers
rememer this?
Life is weird. $800 for a 36hp case and you could have
a whole bus or a Buick for just a little more...
