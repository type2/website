In a message dated 98-08-14 18:26:14 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt;  You should go with an offset doghouse cooler.&gt;&gt;
Right that is the way to go. 
&lt;&lt; You will need:
 
 * cooler and adapter&gt;&gt;
We would call the adapter a stand.
&lt;&lt; * new cooler seals&gt;&gt;
Yes, but if he has the early single relief case he needs to get the tapered
adapter seals to fit the cooler stand to the smaller oil passages in his case.
Also do not use the copper plated washers to space the stand on the single
relief case, doing so will cause leaks.  These washers are to space early
nondoghouse coolers onto dual relief cases so the seals are not crushed.
&lt;&lt; * doghouse fan shroud, including the venting pieces in the back&gt;&gt;
Do you not mean in the front, not the back(Front as in toward the front of the
VW while back as in toward the rear bumper.)?
 &lt;&lt;* thicker fan (23mm, I think)&gt;&gt;
No, please no, even the 29mm will cause a doghouse cooler setup to over heat
the engine.  One needs a 33mm or better yet a 35mm wide fan (Inside
measurement.).
 &lt;&lt;* doghouse rear tin, or modified normal tin, for cooler vent&gt;&gt;
 Here again do you mean the front breast plate with the hole for the doghouse
cooler exaust to go through?
Also one should get the larger rear pulley 2:1 that VW used in the doghouse
setup.  VW used 1:6, 1:8, and finally went back to the 2:1 that they had not
used since the 36HP engines and no the 36HP rear pulley does not have the
offset to work with the 40HP and later sheet metal.  Eric &amp; Barb
