Subject: rings stuck to pistons?

To The Friendly and Knowledgeable List Members,

After the requisite archive search, I'm still in need of your 
assistance. 

I building a * temporary * single port 1600 out of spare parts.
The short block is a used bug motor. I don't know the history before I 
ran it, but it had good power. when I got a better motor,
I pulled it and it was put in spare parts rotation. I pulled the heads 
off it and put them on another motor for a friend's westy. 
After that it sat, covered, in storage for 4 years.
 
Now I've put some other used heads on it and am going to resurrect it.
(I assume these heads are good because they would hold liquid in the 
combustion chamber with out leaking past the valves previous to
installation) 

This engine is on the ground w/ all the tin, manifold, fuel system,
and ignition parts on it. I have a late bus bell housing and and 
automatic starter bolted on to it and the fuel hose stuck in a 
gas can. That way it can be tested on the ground. This beats having
to yank the thing out each time I want to work on the engine's guts.

I ran a compression check and all four cylinders were low, around 60. 
So I pored a small amount of motor oil in the spark plug holes 
and the compression jumped to over 180 for all four. 
It didn't really want to start, so I let it  sit over night.
 
This morning it started, then quit right away.
There was smoke from the tail pipe. After that it failed to
start. I fiddled with the timing and carb, cleaned the spark plugs...
still no start.

Then I ran a compression check. Cylinder # 4 is up to 90 
and the others are back down to 60. 

My guess is that the rings are (still) stuck in the ring groves 
on pistons #`s 1,2,&amp; 3. I could drain and save my fresh oil, fill 
the cylinders with penetrating oil and wait, hoping the chemical 
action would dislodge them. But How long? 
If it leaks past the rings and into the crank case, will the years of
gunk come off the inside of the case and foul up the oil passages?
Would Diesel or Gas be better? (and Cheaper?)

Maybe I could fill one cylinder, with about 100cc of penetrating fluid, 
install the spark plug, then bring that cylinder to top dead center 
ala valve adjustment procedure and tilt the engine on it's valve cover
to let the piston soak. Then do the same for next three.
If I drain the oil prior to this there would be minimal cross 
contamination with the crank case.

How about heating up the cylinders with a propane or map gas torch?
This would make the pistons expand and maybe give me enough squeeze 
to start the beast and and knock the rings loose..
 
So how about it? I need answers ASAP so I can get my veedub out from
under the mango tree and back on the road.

Aloha,
Ken Alford
