&gt; Can anyone guide me in a direction to find some replacement brushes or

Hi Ken,
Try your local electrical motor supplier, or electronics supply, or repair 
shop of starter/generators/alternators or even a vacuum cleaner repair shop.  
These should have a supply of brushes and if you take one of your old brushes 
for comparison you can probably find something close to the same size.  Just 
make sure it is longer because your's will be worn down.  If you can not find 
brushes of the correct size get ones close to size with the copper wiring in the 
correct area.  You can file these down to fit into the motor!
  We did the same a while back when we bought an air horn for our bus.  The 
seller claimed he had tested it and found it working.  Got it home and it did 
not work.  Upon taking it apart it turned out someone had taken it apart and 
crushed the brushes putting it back together incorrectly.  We went through our 
old worn out VW generator brushes, filed these down to a perfect size, and now 
the horn works fine!
