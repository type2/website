Perhaps there is an outfit near you such as the ones here in Seattle???
Glass blowing shops...they can and do buff glass too.  I had a set of
lenses for an early Bus done by one such place.  They look like brand new!
Cost more than new....but hey, these are the originals too!
Worth checking into.

&gt; The '72 has a spiffy new windsheild but the '67 is hurting. The glass has so
&gt; many scratches and wear marks from windshield wipers that it hard to see
&gt; thru, especially at night when the oncoming headlights seem to flare on the
&gt; scratches. I really dont wanna replace the original glass. Are they are
&gt; products and or methods that will clean, polish or restore the glass?
