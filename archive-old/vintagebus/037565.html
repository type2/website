 This metal cost more than a lot of people have paid for their cars!

  On that note: I'm able to get the complete bottom of a bus. Rust free from 
the southwest. I basically need the whole bottom for my DC, minus rear 
quarters. I haven't priced replacement panels yet. I can get the bus buttom for 
free if I go and get it. But that is like 1600 miles away. I'll have to store 
the thing because I'm no where near ready to start working on it. 
  My question is, should I use the thanksgiving holiday to drive 17 hours for 
the free metal, or just by bits and pieces as I have the cash and store them 
up. Keep in mind the bus bottom will be one complete piece. I'm really 
attracted to the free price. But are the panels really expensive?
