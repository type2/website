Subject: RE: [VB] More Ebay


&gt;Anyone see the &quot;NOS&quot; 28 PICT carb currently at $250.  My question:
&gt;why is the &quot;VW&quot; logo on the side machined off?  My first hunch is that
&gt;this is a send-back.


I think those were sold by Solex to parts wholesalers, rather than to VW.
Since they weren't going through VW channels, VW might have required Solex
to remove the VW logos (though it wasn't a very complete removal job!).

Just a theory.
