Hey Now

  Friday post&lt;wink&gt;  Ok volks, Times a wasting!! I've got up on the ol
ebay auction block my amazing orginal Volkswagon Transputter(oh, I like
the sound of that!) It's amazing: it's got, and here this, twenty-one
windows! Only 19 are missing!! Quite a find these days.  Lets get down to
the details: Body: It's in great shape for a car of this age..Just look at
half the 40 year old people out there! Their body's are fat and sassy
so for forty years on a bus, this ain't to bad.  It's got just a smiggin
of &quot;flake&quot;(ie rust) on the front floors, cargo floors, skylights, front
nose, windshield, and both engine trays. This was a rare option at the
factory folks, so don't miss out!  Lemme know tell you about the brakes!:
Since this is a &quot;vintage&quot; car, I figured I'd toss out the stupidly modern
drum breaks and add in the factory supplied optional &quot;fred flinstone&quot;
breaking system.  That's right! Just apply feet to surface and you can
stop like the rubbles did way back in the pay-me-a-stoic era.  It comes
with orginal bolts and org. dust.  All the rest of the inside crap was
removed and promptly burned.  But I'm sure you can find this stuff
elsewhere.  I've got the middle seat, but I'm using it for a porto potty.
I gotta have something to grab onto and that grab handle is the bees knees
I tell you!  Oh, and just for you northwest folks: It's got the optional
SHOWER system included! Normally you've had to open up the sunroof in the
rain to get your daily shower... but no more because you can clean up at
any of the various watering stations throughout the 400cubic cm cargo
area.  My personally favorite is the skylight showers.  It comes equiped
with the full flow shower head of two-inchs of holes or more on EACH of
the 8 sky lights! How's about that!  Now, I think I've wasted enough of
your time with the minor details...lets set the researve at around
$25,000. Thats good because I hope to get at least anywhere around 30 to
80 grand(that is without the Fred Flinstone option, of course... with it
it could go for anywhere from 120k to the option of me taking your next
kid!).  Oh, I don't have any pictures...couldn't afford them after dumping
THIS much money into this prizing winning puppy.  And for the lucky
winner...I'm in Seattle.  Cash only, and you can then pick the bus up on
the sunny shores of Nome, AK.  Believe me, this is the one you want!

p.s. if you email me saying I want it then I personally give you the
bullet so you can shoot yourself you ignat mother-bus-lover!
