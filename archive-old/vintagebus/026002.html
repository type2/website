Subject: [VB] Clutch disc cleaning?
Message-ID: &lt;38149292.48F5F3A0_at_variflex_dot_com&gt;

Has anyone ever successfully gotten oil out of a clutch disc?  Mine got
a small amount of engine oil in it and now it slips on hard
acceleration.  I'm too cheap to buy a new one so any kind of shade-tree
fix would be appreciated.
Thanks
