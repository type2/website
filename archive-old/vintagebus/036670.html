Hi All,

&gt; Believe it or not, these clips are still available from VW.  


I last got a batch from my local VW dealership. They were still listed on
their parts system and it seemed as though they weren't impossible to get.
They have been keeping the hubcaps on my bus for almost a year now.

Bad news - this was in South Africa and they were probably made by VW south
africa.

Later 

Michael
