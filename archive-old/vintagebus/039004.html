Subject: Gas tank size - 58 SC?
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 08:24:05 -0600

Anybody know off hand what the gas tank size(s) are for various buses?
I thought my 58 would only hold like 11 or so, but the other day I put
in 13 gallons.  I know it's not original cause its got a sender in it.
Just curious...
