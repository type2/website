Subject: Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team Stickers are here!!!

 Howdy all...sorry for not posting this on a Friday, but I'll be out of
town for the next couple Fridays.
  Those of you who have been around for a while may remember the Air
Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team (NOT the AIRS) from a few years back.
Anyway, after having people ask for years about stickers, I finally
decided to get a batch printed up. I've also finally gotten around to
starting up a web page as well. Sticker details and other goodies are on
the site-
http://teamspatula_dot_com/searchandrescue.html
The stickers look great - even the printer commented on how sharp they
look, and are $2.00 each, 3 for $5.00, and I can work out something if you
want more than that.
Please email for more information, as I have a thousand of these to sell...
:)
Also, I have 2 XL tshirts left, but I'll be printing more up in the spring
in time for EveryBus 2006.

Also, if you have a picture of yourself wearing your ACS&amp;R shirt while
making a rescue, feel free to send it to me, and I'll add it to the page.
Thanks,
