'62 Double Cab:  54K original (now has 57K).  Original pearl white with some
surface rust on front of roof line and in bed.  No rust through any where,
and never seriously hit.  Straightest bus I have (almost as nice a
Everetts).  Need the lower 61/62 only 3 position front seat brackets, so I
can install the correct hump back front seat instead of the incorrect 1/3
2/3 seat that is in there now.  Running  a big nut (installed by PO) and a
DP 1600 I recently rebuilt.  Most useful vehicle I've ever owned.  Need
bows/tilt and wood.

'65 Pop Top Westy:  My first bus.  Bought it when I knew nothing about the
dumb things.  Turns out it was only 40% complete.  I learned the hard way.
Should have given up long ago, but now too far in to quit.  Currently a
shell.  Have fixed dash hack, passenger side floor, rear corners and batt.
tray all with OG metal.  Need to finish both rockers and lower front
frames.    Need a correct side tent and rack to complete the parts search.

'67 Hard Top Westy:  Rusty parts bus out of ID.  100% complete interior that
will go into the '65.  Front bashed in, rear corners trashed, rockers are
barely there.  Was a driver till I took it down to store it at the parents
(80 miles) and she promptly pumped out tons of oil out the main seal and
started going thump thump thump.  Restorable, but will most likely get sold
or cut up.
