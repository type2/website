Subject: RE: [VB] Heater cable

did the handle part break or the cable?

I had a 72 sb once.  I wired the heater boxes closed for the summer and then
open in the winter... I'd regulate the cabin temp by rolling the window
down.

Well, these frosty mornings here in the PNW sure get the icicles forming on

thing broke! I just twist the knob now to keep blood circulating through my
hand ! How hard is it to install a new one ?
