&gt;So Michele
&gt;Did you buy all the fashion accessories before you bought the bike?
&gt;And how much chrome do you really have ; )
&gt;Inquiring RUB's wanna know

Actually, we only have the worn out stuff that you actually NEED to
ride with safety. We laugh all the time at what we call Rolex
Riders---THOSE are the ones I think you're referring to?  Ours is a
1968 that my hubby restored from the ground up---sort of like I'm
doing with my bus.  None of that frou frou
&quot;lets-see-how-much-we-can-show-off&quot; stuff.  We're the kind of people
who act the same in the Bus as we do on the Harley, in the Stealth or
in the Explorer. REAL people, ya know?  We just have lots of
interests, and I hope that doesn't make us any less serious about any
of them.  We're attempting to own as many of the things we love as
possible before real kids come along---after that we'll be BROKE!!!
:-)
Michele and Chuck
