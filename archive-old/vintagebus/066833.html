&gt;Another son of mine has a 66 split window bus.I am needing to replace the
&gt;passengers side taillight because the battery has been slamming into it.
&gt;There was no battery tie down when we bought it.

My '64 has a metal strap that went around the top of the battery.  On the 
outboard side there is a bolt welded to the floor plate that sticks up
inside the engine compartment for one end of the strap to bolt to.  On
the inboard side, there is a metal hook for the wire over-center latch
(like a toolbox lid latch) on the end of the metal strap.  There was
originally a metal cover, insulated on the bottom side, that went over
the top of the battery.  The strap went over the metal cover.

When I got my Bus, the outboard bolt was bent and the strap had rusted
in two.  I chiseled the bolt head off the floor, took it out, and replaced
it with a stainless steel bolt, washer, and nut.  I drilled holes in the
broken ends of the strap and bolted them back together using stainless
steel bolts and a length of galvanized pipe strap.  I fabricated a battery
cover from 1/4&quot; plywood and some 1x2s.  Overall it works fairly well.
If there's a small hole, about 1/4&quot;, in the floor on the outboard side,
and a little metal hook about 1&quot; long and 1/2&quot; high on the floor on the 
inboard side, this is probably what you have.  

'67 and later Buses had a clamp to hold the battery to the floor, kind of
like like late-model Chevys, instead of the strap over the top of the
battery.  If the floor looks like it might have been replaced you may
have this style.

Look at page 567 of the '67 parts manual online
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ to see pictures of both styles.
 
&gt;There is no rust in the area now, I am afriad drilling holes will make 
&gt;the battery area vulnerable to it.

If you do end up drilling a hole, give it a few coats of paint after you
drill it.  That'll slow the rust down quite a bit.
