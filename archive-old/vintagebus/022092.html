Subject: NEATO page update
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have now updated the Coming Events and Local Chapters sections of the 
NEATO page with current info.  The Coming Events I could find links to 
I added, as well as links and email contacts for the Local Chapters.

If anyone knows of additional links for the other Coming Events or 
links or email addresses for Local Chapters, please let me know.  

Also, doublecheck the email links...  I'm not sure if I have the right 
one for Rick Denis...

I'll try to get more updates done later this week.

Dave
