Hi Tom,
You might want to take your alternator apart and see if it just needs brushes 
and/or bearings.  Did the same to Barb's dad's 1981 Toyota and fixed it for 
only $5.00!!  Once open you should be able to tell what has gone bad in there.
  Definitely fix and/or pay more attention to your idiot lights.  They should 
have told you that something was WRONG way before you ended up with a dead 
battery.  It could have been a broken fan belt and fried engine instead!
