Hi,

I like to travel. I think busses do to. They certainly seem to like it.
Don't hold them back. Let them free. Let them follow their destiny. I hope
all my old cars and busses are wandering around. Don't you think it would be
cool one day if you were visiting Japan to see it driving around? &quot;Holy
#_at_%&amp;, that's my old bus!!!&quot;

We all agree they are more than just pieces of metal. Why hobble them?
Seriously, it's a kind of censorship if you think about it. We are no better
or more deserving than anyone else.
