Subject: Radio repair.


I'm sure we've gone over this before, but can someone point me in
the right direction for the guy that was doing early radio
restos?? I know he no longer does them, I'm looking for some
pointers (maybe parts) on an old Telefunken I want to put in my
Barndoor single so that when I finally find a set of
(original)Safaris for it the water that leaks in will have
something to ruin other that just the
floor.........................8-)

Really though I could use the contact info,

Greg
