I think that was correct for the 1949 and 1950 Deluxes,
in '51 they went to those stupid little rubbing strips
on the rear corners and did away with the bows and overriders.
Then someone got a wild hare and started making those lame
ribbed bumpers, and for the deluxes add this ridiculous
aluminum trim to the ends.  In '59, they saw the error of their 
ways, and brought them back, although just in white to save DM on 
production costs.   Ok, I'm setting the crack pipe down now...
