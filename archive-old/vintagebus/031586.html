&gt; Hey there Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Just wanted to introduce myself. I've been lurking on the web
&gt; reflector for awhile doing &quot;research&quot;, and for the past few months
&gt; I've been lurking in digest mode.
&gt;
&gt; I'll be looking for a single cab, kombi, or standard project from the
&gt; New England area. I have entertained the idea of shipping a bus (or a
&gt; &quot;fly in drive out&quot; deal) from a rust free area, but I think I'm gonna
&gt; see what I can turn up locally first. Hmmm.... There is that 67 SC
&gt; for sale up in NH on thesamba_dot_com, but rust in the treasure chest
&gt; kinda scares me.
&gt;

John,
welcome aboard and good luck in your search.
You obviously know where to turn to for questions.
