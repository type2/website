Subject: 46 mm axle nut tool worked great

After two months of soaking the nut with penetrating oil daily, and still
bending my 10' steel cheater bar, I ordered this little tool from Busdepot
for $7.  It's made specifically to fit around the nut, with a hole for a
1/2&quot; socket, and a nice place to whack with a small sledge.  I put it on,
never even used the socket, and one minute later, nut was off.  Now I can
find out what the brakes look, or don't look like)
