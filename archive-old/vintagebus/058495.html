Subject: RE: [VB] Relays

Ok, so I've got the turn signal relay hooked up and it even blinks (only
I've got to figure out why the opposite side has a faint blink when one side
is blinking).  Now the 12V E-flasher relay that I have has the DIN numbers
for headlight wiring, so I have no idea. Is it possible to fry it by
connecting the wrong wires?

Hi Charles, 
It is best to change all relays to 12 volt since your bus was already 
converted.  This will result in relays that will last longer.  If you find a

source to 12 volt the E-blinkers relay tell us cause so far we have had no 
luck finding that one! 
  As far as you turn signal relay you will have to look at the 63 wiring 
diagram for USA buses and figure out which wires you have and what number 
connections are on you relay.  On some relays you have to clip two of the 
wires together to one connector on the relay and the last wire goes to a 
differant clip.  In otherwords you may have to experiement.
