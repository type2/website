Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh (fwd)

Speaking of the doghouse, I got myself into a really silly jam....

On my '59, the transmission is notched for the bolt head so it doesn't
spin when you nut it from the engine side.  I put in a new 1776 that I
built (with doghouse and threaded case for that bolt), and couldn't
figure out why I was having such trouble putting the bolt in from the
tranny side once I got it into the threads.  Obviously, it slipped into
the notched arena.  I was able to get it fairly tight, though I feared
breaking off the head... Now, fastforward to my recent pulling of the
engine....  I couldn't get anything onto the bolt.  I was about two tries
away from trying to cut the thing off when the wrench finally grabbed the
ear of the bolt head and started a 20 minute journey to get it out.  It
wasn't until I actually had it spinning that I realized what the whole
problem was. 

Any thoughts beyond filing the bolt head area of the tranny down?  I
don't see a problem, but am open to other suggestions.
