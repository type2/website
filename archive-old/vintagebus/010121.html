I fool the universe out of a living (and a T1 line to my house) by
administering LANs, WANs and other systems at the Fresno Police Dept.
Say what you will about police, but they're great friends to have if
your hobby is drinking and driving. [Kids, pay no attention to the
sarcastic man]

p.s. Craig, I need some machining done on my General, need a ballpark
figure.
