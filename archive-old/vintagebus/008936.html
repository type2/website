&gt; P.S. I was given a free Vintage VW Calender from my local Dealership. He
told
&gt; me that there are 4 styles to choose from 2 new and 2 vintage - Go get em
!


I stopped by the local VW dealer (Stan Olson AutoWorld ) here in Omaha and
they knew nothing of them so IF SOMEONE can get their hands on one of the
Vintage ones I would love one.  Anybody?
