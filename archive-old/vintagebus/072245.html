&gt; All that flap stuff in the fan housing...do I really need it?  I understand

Hi Tom,
No you really do not need it if you do not care if the lifespan of the engine 
is greatly reduced in weather below 70F. That plently of raw fuel and water 
that gets by the unexpanded rings, pistons in a cold engine and fills the 
engine oil with.  Less HP and worse MPG.  That the engine due to the uneven heating 
and cooling loosens head and engine case studs/bolts alot sooner.  In 
otherwords it is just like trying to run a water cooled without a thermostat, and 
just ask a experienced watercooled mechanic what that will do!
