Subject: Disk brakes on a 66?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

A friend of mine wants to convert a 66 bus to front disks and wondered if
there was a feasible method of using a set from a 73.  I have been told that
that entire beam could potentially bolt up, but would raise the ride height
and alter handling.  What are the possibilites?  Are there any stock VW disks
that can bolt up to 66 bus spindles?
Thanks,
Dan Morris
