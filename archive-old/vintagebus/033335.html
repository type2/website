&lt;&lt; What could be the problem here? I'm scared that the oil is getting thinned 
out and could cause me to burn up an engine. Please If ya have any experience 
or ideas write me.&gt;&gt;
 Hi Scott,
It could easily be one or more of the following.
1.  Too high of fuel pump rod or if you are using an electric fuel pump 
without a regulator which causes too high of fuel pressure and pushes the 
carb resivour shut off valve/s open.
2.  Too big of main or idle jetting or too small of air correction jets.
3.  Too heavy or leaky float/s or bad shut off valve/s or the latter missing 
thier gaskets in the carb.

 &lt;&lt;The oil level is not too high so no real volume of gas is in the oil. I 
have no major oil leaks.&gt;&gt;
With fuel getting thinned sometimes the oil level will not change.  This is 
due to the oil getting thinned now gets by the rings easier and gets burnt 
off so no leakage.  This will also do wonders at ruining your rings due to 
the thining of the oil!
 
&lt;&lt;My real question is can I get better mileage from this setup (carb and 
exhaust)HOW?????? I realize that the carb is the going to be the general 
answer to my problem but we really did do a good job on the adjustments. &gt;&gt;
Tach you bus and write down where 1,500 and 3,000 engine RPM at what MPH in 
all forward gears.  Extractor mufflers are not really needed unless you have 
a engine larger than a 1641cc or drive at way over 4,000 RPM most of the 
time.  Extractors lean out the engine and cause it to heat up if not jetted 
way richer and if the tip/s of the extractor is not extended out past the 
side of the bus you run the risk of monoxiding yourself or passengers.  Also 
make sure your odometer is fairly correct.   Eric&amp;Barb
