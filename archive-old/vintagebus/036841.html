Well I sprayed it down with carb cleaner (it had been cleaned already at the
car wash but I missed some spots) and using the wire wheel and air gun was
able to get the engine cleaned good enough.

wire wheel?    I don't see why you'd wire wheel it, it'd leave scratches 
everywhere.

 The previous owner claims he
had 1000 miles on new heads and by the looks of the pushrod tubes (they are
nice and shiny) and new seals, he wasn't lying.  Unfortunately, I found out
that #4 has been helicoiled and since I HATE helicoiled heads ( I had one on
my Westy and it was a PITA), I'm probably going to have to replace it.  I
know old ford plugs are extra big and I'm wondering if I can just drill and
tap the head for a ford plug and use an odd plug.  I'd settle for this if it
would work (has anyone tried it?)  I'm g

that sounds wierd, doing the odd plug thing.   I'd keep it  alll 4 the same, 
so if you really dislike the helicoil, swap the heads.      Think about 
chamber size and use one of the same size (same style casting of head, not 
just same PN- or check if you have the right tools) or you will likely find 
the engine un balanced if you heads are mismatched , could be as much as 
4.5cc difference (from my experience) which means differnt CRs or each side 
of the motor.  
Now I'm going to be running a 6V generator in this bus (although I'd like to
run a 6v alternator if there was such a thing for a 66 bus) and am hoping
that I have the right gen. stand for it.  Mine is part number 113.101.211
(can anyone confirm this?)  It's got a filler with only one tube coming out
the top (no road draft tube.)  Does anyone have a good used 6v generator
that they would like to sell.  I could sure use one.
 -- - - - 
the 66 would have original had a large diameter  6V generator- but if you are 
putting a smalldiameter 6V on it just make sure you have the right one by 
does the gen fit the stand.   You can undo the wierd screw down the neck of 
the filller and change fillers over.  I use a large screw driver and a hammer 
to knock it loose.

One more question and then I gotta hit the sack tonight.  Does a 66 bus use
a squared off or rounded engine tin in front of the cooling fan right above
the tranny and flywheel?  I know my 71 Westy used a boxed shape piece of
tin.
- -  -- - -- - - 
the taller tin is for the bay window buses, which have a larger gap there,  
they look like the regular bus/splitty ones (rounder), but have that extra  
square edged piece tacked on the top.
