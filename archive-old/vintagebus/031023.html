Should be a good time with some cool busses coming out of the woodwork.  Drew.

Located in beautiful shaded Kennedy Grove.  Kennedy Grove is located
east of Richmond just a hour within Sacramento and San Jose.

contribute.

This is a low key event with no formal judging just a nice afternoon to
spend with your fellow bus friends.

Entry is 5.00 dollars (charged by the park) and dogs are extra.

Last year we had about twenty busses, even a few barndoors showed up.
This year we expect about 30 busses.

Directions: From South Bay. take 680 West towards Sacramento, take 24
West, take Orinda exit, stay to the right off the exit, you will go
through the town of Orinda, the road will turn to San Pablo Dam road,
take this for about 8 miles, Kennedy Grove is on the right, look for
signs.

Directions All other points, take I80 towards Richmond, exit San Pablo
Dam, stay to the right off the exit, you will go through the town of El
Sobrante for about 10 miles, Kennedy Grove is on the left, look for
signs.
