I finally got my vacation time of 2 weeks approved at work today so the
wheels are in motion for Rob and Justin Laffoon and myself to head out to
the Classic this year in Rob's 1966 Single Cab. We've spent 2 solid days of
maintenance doing a big long list of repairs and loose ends so that the SC
is ready to take a long voyage cross country from Nebraska to California.
We are bringing a 1600DP along in case we lose an engine and a few other
&quot;just in cases.&quot;

I called and talked to Rob this evening on the phone and figured that I
would make this post so that all who are interested will know our itinerary.
I hesitated to post to the vintagebus list as I'm still one sore SOB for
being attacked for my posting of the VW Ads however, Rob really wanted me to
share this post with the vintage bus crowd so on his behalf, here I am.

Looking at the calendar, June 1st is a Friday.  The plan is for Rob &amp; Justin
to leave work Friday evening and head on down here to Beatrice. He'll pick
me up and we'll actually head down to Kansas City and catch what's left of
the MoKan and KC Kombi's campout as well as the MoKan show the next morning.
If Rick Taylor and Steve Hughs (fellow Buskatiers) are still up for a
caravan to the Classic this year, we can head out from KC either Saturday
evening or bright and early Sunday morning.  I have a good friend Wendy who
just bought a new house and I'd like to see her new HQ.  It would make a lot
of sense to crash there Saturday night and group with the boys Sunday
morning for the big cruise to Cali.

Rob and I would like to take Interstate most of the way due our being on a
time schedule of 2 weeks (having to be at work on Monday the 18th) but NOT
travel Interstate speeds.  Of course we will go faster if we travel alone
but in a caravan we will be travel what the group can handle (within
reason.)  Our next goal will be Albequerque where hopefully we can meet up
with JP and the gang.  We will be looking for places that we can crash for a
little rest and we'd sure love to have some listees host us OR at least meet
up with us and show us where a good camping place is.  We would really like
some showers or bathing areas because it'll no doubt be one hot trip.  BTW:
We will have our own tent and a canvas on the SC so we have our own places
to sleep.  If any listees can have us, I'd appreciate an email with your
name, phone number, address, and directions to you place from the nearest
main road in the area.

Moving right along we will have to miss Phoenix and Kyle on the way out
because we are going to take I-40 and do a layover in Havasu.  If for some
reason the layover in Havasu doesn't work on the way out, we will make sure
and catch in on the return trip. We will be going through ahead of the
actual caravan as Rob and I want to do the Dairy Queen Thursday night.  We
are headed towards Oceanside where Don Boneau is going to host us.  He's
been after Rob and I for a LONG time to get our rears out there and meet
face to face with him so thanks to his repeated offers, we will have a base
HQ to operate from.  I figure we will stay at Don's and catch some AC until
Friday evening.  I'm hoping that Don will be able to be our tour guide on
Friday and take us to all the places having open house - WCM, Gene Berg, and
whatever else would be a great place to tour on Friday. Friday night, we
will definitely want to head to Rich Yosts for the big hoopla Ronnie posted
about. Ronnie bragged this up to Rob and I back in January so this would be
a lot of fun.  Saturday is OCTO and the toy show so we'd do that and then
probably hang out at Yuccipa again.  And then of course on Sunday is the
Classic where we'll meet up with fellow Buskatier Terry Wolfe who will be
coming home from a trip with his wife.  They are going to rent a car and
catch the Classic quick before they have to catch a plane back to Omaha.

Anyway, after the Classic, I have a friend in San Diego that I must visit
for a day.  Then the rest of the trip is up in the air. We'll know how much
time we'll need to get back home and can decide if we want to hang at Don's
some more (if we haven't over extended our stay), or maybe head out and
catch some quality time in Havasu with Lou, John, and Ronnie.  Maybe we can
even see Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon which I've never seen in person.

We have a lot of ground to cover in a relatively short amount of time so
we'll be on the move.  I need to locate a GOOD deal on a laptop or notebook
computer so I can do my nightly trip reports on the road.  If anyone has a
deal out there, let me know.  I'm almost tempted to hack an iopener
netpliance machine with linux and use it but I'd much rather get a dirt
cheap laptop (even if it's a 386 with a hard drive, text editor, and a
reliable floppy drive.)  Modem access isn't a must as I can use Don's
machine and other listees machines to send trip reports on.

I'm hoping that back home here, Keith Petite on the Buskatiers list can
field our pictures and trip reports so that all of you can get an update on
the days events.  It's awesome watching event unfold over the net -
especially when you can't be someplace but would like to.  This is the next
best thing.

I guess that's it.  Please email your replies to me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com
so I can have a complete planner ready when the time comes to go.
