Merry Christmas to you all!

If you are tired of all those semi-clad female tool calendars in your 
garage, if you like Split-era Busses, and want something ultra-cool 
to guide you through 1999, here's the calander for you!  Thanks to 
an on-going joint project between the German &quot;BulliKartei e.V.&quot; Club, 
the British &quot;Split Screen Van Club&quot;, and the US based &quot;NEATO&quot; 
Split Bus Clubs, another great calendar full of awesome Split 
Windshield Busses has been produced. 

This 16&quot; T  x12&quot; W full color 1999 calendar is called &quot;Variations 1999&quot;, 
and features neat shots of Split-Busses, with an emphasis this year 
on the more unique and unusual variations of the early era of 
Transporter.  Each month features great photos, text and graphics.  
On each month's page you'll see the ambulance, a &quot;cinecar&quot; mobile 
cinema bus, a hi-roof brewery Bus, a brown lengthened German 
hearse, a turntable ladder Single-cab, a wild &quot;halftrack&quot; Kombi, an 
airport &quot;double slider door&quot; transport, a 1948 &quot;plattenwagen&quot; factory 
floor flatbed, a U.S. remote radio broadcasting Deluxe, a 
&quot;castastrophe-wagen&quot;,  and the months that are my personal wacky 
favorites feature the '61 pick-up shortened and converted to a huge, 
mid engined lawnmower and the shell of an old Splitty inverted and 
used as part of a small Bavarian chapel.  All in all, an excellent 
calendar for the Type 2 enthusiast.

I believe that NEATO only received 50 copies of this limited edition 
calendar, and many have already been aquired by NEATO members.  
There may still be a few copies left.  If you are already a NEATO 
member, send $17.  If you aren't (now's the time to join us and save 
$3 off your calendar) send $20.  This includes Priority mail.  Our 
apologies if the run is sold out by the time your request arrives, as 
it's our understanding that we can't get any more.   Send your check to:   

NEATO, P.O.Box 4190, Albuquerque, NM 87196.  I just received my 
calendar, and I'm sure any Split Bus nut will love this hanging on their 
wall.  Just keep your greasy fingers off those beautiful pages!

Stay warm a have a delightful Holiday everyone!
