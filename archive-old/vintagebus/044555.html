the manifolds with the fixed ends are 40hp (or 36hp if the heat riser flanges 
have a different shape.)

I have successfully used a piece of clutch cable on a drill to clean out 
manifold heat risers.  well, I'll use a drill bit till it get to the corner, 
then use a piece of cable.  

don't use the cable on mor ethan one manifold.  I did think and it broke off 
in there.

but really, it works great.  forget who suggested it to me, but bless their 
pointy little head.
