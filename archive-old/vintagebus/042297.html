&gt; Greetings all
&gt; I'm looking for any info on westy so-44 option, from what I understand this
&gt; was mostly only offered in Canada and Germany.

Germany only, according to the OO of my so-44...

&gt; Looking for any pics or info especially any that relates to bay windows.

Ahh.  Here's the rub.  SO-44 was the designation for the split window bus.

The baywindow variant was labled (I think..) the so-67.  Frank and Cathy's
Dor has this interior.

&gt; My 69 westy bench model appears to have originally come with this option(yes
&gt; it was German delivered)
&gt; Missing all camp gear so any help greatly appreciated!

Good luck, one of these days I'll get my so-44 lit scanned..*sigh*

later...david
