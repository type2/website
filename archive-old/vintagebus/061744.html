Subject: Re: [VB] Temp Question

Mine does about the same thing...maybe around 200 at those temps on the
fwy.  I think it is normal.  Lets face it you're pushing a brick through
the air with that little thing and the RPMs are constant.  The motor
does not get to cool down like it does when you're bopping around town
stopping every 4-5 minutes at the next light.

&gt; I have a 65 bus running a basically stock DP1600.  Only non-stock items may be Bocar 34/3 carb (with a 137 main jet) and electronic ignition.  I have a temp guage connected to the rear pressure relief valve.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is,  when I cruise down the HWY (55 +/- (mostly -)) temp on the guage goes up to maybe 210.  When I am idling or driving around town temp only hits 180+.  I realize that my guage may not be calibrated correctly, but my bus is obviously running cooler in stop/go traffic than on the freeway.
&gt; 
&gt; These conditions were observed today, outside temp was about 78-80.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this abnormal?  What could be the cause if it is?
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy your day!
