Subject: I second the safari redesign co-op

With all the expertise in these vintage transporters and knowledge general
or specific of materials and engineering involved in these simple
mechanisms, we should be able to make a great stab at designing to even the
point of blue prints or at least specs of what we need. This is entirely
possible, and I for one will do what I can to help and use as much of the
resources available to me through work,etc to help. We have a CAD guy and
are a water resources company. Design build, install maintane water plants
in Carribean from 10K gallon RO units to 100K+, as well as any thing else to
do with water as a resource.  One thing I can say right now is that the
ultimate material to use is 316 SS. It is specially made for water/saltwater
applications, the stuff you get at 90% of the places is 304 which ironically
will rust, that part always gets the guys saying&quot; but it is Staineless
steel!&quot;.  If your type 2 was a submarine, these safari frames would last
forever and salt water is among the most detrimental elements there is.

Idealistic, but I really belive that people are a greater resource than we
realize, and again most of us are fairly specialized and could all
contribute if even to offer consumer input and help watch everyones back for
mistakes overlooked.
