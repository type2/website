this??any thoughts on the factory filter setup??

Two things I don't like about this thang:
1: It's in the oil cooler loop.  This means no filtration till the oil warms
up, perhaps a minor point since filtration %75 of the time is better than no
filtration all of the time.  BUT, what effect does it have on the pressure
relief valves?  Does it change the pressure characteristics of the loop?
What if the filter adds pressure causing the relief valves to think the
engine is still cold and bypassing the oil cooler when it shouldn't?

2: It looks like it would be messy.

Bonus gripe:  I'm a cranky old purist who don't like change!
