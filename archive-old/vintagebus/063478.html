Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Puzzler - Need Help


While you're waiting for the relay, go under the bus, and remove and clean
up all your starter motor/solenoid contacts, re-spring the connectors a
bit, without damaging them, and reassemble. Remember to disconnect your
battery ground first! You might also check the transmission grounding
strap, over by the front tranny mount - may need to r-and-r it to clean
up. Then clean your battery connections too, as well as the end of the
ground cable and the chassis area it bolts into.
I've never had any problems like the one you are having, with my 67, in
the 29.6 years I've had it.

good luck,  cal
