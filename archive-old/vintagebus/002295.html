&gt; Good thing we drive 30+ year old technology....now if we could just keep
the
&gt; &quot;man&quot; off our backs ;-)

Driving 30 + year old technology doesn't do any good when they raise the
standards you have to pass above numbers the engine never can pass or was
designed to pass. This was the main reason for SB42 and the rolling 30. Too
many people were in an uproar over the standards they imposed on 68 to 72
cars. The engines cannot be run as 'clean' as they wanted the emission
specs. You would have had to put a catalytic converter on to pass!
