Subject:  gas reserve-bad4pump?
Message-ID: &lt;a1764e1d.246a78f8_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

re running out of gas being bad for the fuel pump:

never had a fuel pump go bad in a VW with a reserve tap.  But have done in a
VW w/o.   From this scientific survey I conclude the opposite.  Fuel taps
protect pumps.   (hope your bs sensor is working)

But the VWs were designed for the reserve tap running out system, right?
Since they moved the tap switch control to be accessable from the drivers
seat after 5 years, it probably was a compaint that you had to pull over,
open the engine lid, and  move the tap lever to reserve, then restart the
bus, to get it to go.    Okay, the postbarn drivers get to reach over  and
merely pull a knob.    The tap wasn't dropped till 62, after 11 years of bus
production and people running out and switching to reserve.      Don't know
the specs on bugs.
