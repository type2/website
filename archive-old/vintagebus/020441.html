&gt;&gt;Oh man! I'd rather explore Canada and Alaska. At least
&gt;I could understand the screaming &lt;as long as I avoided
&gt;the Japanese who now own Alberta&gt; and greater chance
&gt;that the beer would be cold. ;-) Oh, Canada!

Ahem, I beg to difer here, Alberta and the west are still owned by Labatts 
drinking rednecks and loggers who are busy sending gas and electricity 
to people in the south who insist on driving huge SUV's and 
airconditioning large tracts of land too hot even for the devil.
hmmm, I wonder if we know anybody driving a big Ford who might fit 
that discription. =:- &gt;
