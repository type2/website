I got this same message, verbatim, some time ago; I view it as spam to 
get people go go check out their site.

Look at the fine print at the bottom; &quot;This site is not affiliated with
volkswagen AG&quot; etc.

Made ya look though, didn't he!

So, in conclusion, don't get all worked up over it, OK?  At least
not until Friday.

Thom
