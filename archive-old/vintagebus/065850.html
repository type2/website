&lt;&lt; I knew the description in Bentley was too simple! &gt;&gt;

&gt; ya, for some reason they seem to ignore the decades of rust and DPOs who 
&gt; replaced all the wiring with yellow wires.  Oh wait, the buses were new
when 
&gt; those books were written, never mind.

Yeah I suppose so.  I do hate it when POs replace wires, I am quite lucky in
that my wiring is all the correct colours.  My friends bus had an added
wiring loom from front to rear for all wires except rear lights, in which
the wires had different colours at one end from the other.  It took ages to
get all the sensors to work.

When I get the front shift rod off, should I replace anything whilst I am
doing it, or is it just a case of putting it back together with lots of
grease?

Thanks
Paul
