hi again

I plan on occasionally using my bus this winter for short ski trips.  I
am thinking about putting a propane bottle on my roof rack and running a
hose from that through the pop out window to a propane heater and/or
stove. Given that I don't plan on driving with this heater on - is there
anything i should be concerned about.
