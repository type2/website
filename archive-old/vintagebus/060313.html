Subject: SP head advice needed, sources, new vs rebuilt.

Some of you may know of the troubles I have had with my engine, and the
lack of support from my engine builder, who I am now at the argument and
nearly to passing insult level. Fact is, he's not going to hook me up
with the heads I need, nor do I trust him to touch this engine any
longer.
I cant drive up ANY small hills (I am in PA, we have NO real mountains,
:) ) in 3rd for a couple minutes at 30mph without the engine all of a
sudden getting REALLY tight valves on the head with more compression
(yes, this motor IS unbalanced compression!) A long highway run will
also do me in. He also neglected the tin between cyls and heads, the
triangle deflector pieces often replaced with moded t3 cool tins. I also
miss the pass side small rear deflector piece, the one that is pointing
straight down. The problem head runs 25-50deg hotter than the other (150
vs 125 comp 250-300deg vs 325-350 deg), and oil temp is always 185 or
180, I cant get the oil too hot, thank goodness. Measured all over case
with lasers, head temp measured from area closest to plug from
underneath. Now I have to sell my fasty to make the money I need to
repair my splitty, which is more important to me.
Well, anyway, I need stock, good SP heads. What are sources of new ones,
are they VW or who makes them? How sells them, and am I better off
rebuilding some laying around at the GOOD shop I just found here? We can
cc and hand lap them, but I need castings that won't quit also. Matched
is a requirement.
Frustrated and barely making it home,
Ale
