For some unknown reason, I got this message some time ago. Has anyone ever 
heard about Enzmanns? Any relationship with VWs? (Check the link at the bottom 
of his message to see his cars).

Betreff: Enzmann 506


I am the oldest son of Emil Enzmann. My father constructed in 1956 the
Enzmann 506 sportscar. It was a polyester-shell on a beetle - chassis.
The negatvform is back in the possesion of the family and we are starting a
new production of carrosseries.
The price for a carrosserie with seats is 13'000.- Swiss francs in
Switzerland. You may also order a complet car with 100 horse power engine
and disc brake for 50'000.- Swiss francs.
For other questions please contact me.
Enzmann Kari
