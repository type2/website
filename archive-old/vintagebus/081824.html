&gt;&gt;  I can get a turn-key engine from GEX that will generate 120 horses, but 
I'm  wondering if that isn't overkill!? With the gearing the bus has now, it 
just  seems like I'll get to 60 mph really fast and then what? :) I do a little 
work  myself but mostly farm stuff out.  &lt;&lt;
Hi Jason,
Torque is what the bus needs to get off the starting line especially with a  
load on board, and when climbing hills.  Not a drag race high RPMing  high 
flowing engine in which torque is greatly reduced.  You can run a  search for &quot;G
EX&quot; engine in the archives, and we would suggest looking for NQ's  building a 
high flow &amp; HP engine and how just a few months later he was  trading off the 
big $$$$ HP parts for stock parts to get his bus  running better.
  Plus having 120 HP from an engine case that was designed at  most to 
produce stock 60 HP.  This is like being a 125 Lbs.  weakling and waking up one 
moring to find your fairy god mother gave you an  muscle make over so you are 
built like Arnold Schwarzenegger at his  buffest.  So you are thrilled and go out 
to a local gym and try to lift 500  Lbs., and suddenly hear snap crackle pop 
of the bones that were not  strengthed to go with the bigger badder muscles.  
While with 120  HP engine with stock engine case you might not snap something 
right  off the bat, you will not, especially with a bus get engine lifespan 
much beyond  40,000 miles and often much less.
 
&gt;&gt;  I am not a purist, though I will keep the bus fairly  stock. Any
suggestions appreciated.  &lt;&lt;



Since you are a newbie we would suggest you keep it a simple engine much  
more like stock for now.  Like a 1600 SP (single port) with  69mm counterwieght 
crank, doghouse cooler, and full flow oil  filteration.
 
  We had a long block built by Bear's VW Machine in San  Diego CA. (more on 
them in the archives) and so far no problems in over  60,000 miles.
It is a 7.1:1 compression, 1641cc (these thinner slip in cylinder  walls can 
be warped easier if engine is overheated) SP.  Boring the  engine case 
cylinder bores bigger for bigger cylinders weakens the  case and in the stock 
aluminum/magnesium often causes a crack forward of #3  cylinder spraying oil onto the 
FW &amp; clutch!
69mm counterwieght cast crank (cast can be broken if over revved as a  norm).
Heads with larger diameter (9mm) stemmed exhaust valves to help  prevent them 
from stretching and breaking off.
Doghouse shroud modified to accept the 40% bigger type 4 oil cooler.
We added a vintage EMPI oil pump with built in oil filter mount in the  
cover.  A present day CB oil filter/pump can be used, but to be used with  most 
stock mufflers it needs to be cut, angled, welded back together and  redrilling 
of passages.  To keep the filter from taking the space of the  left heat riser 
tube coming out of the front of the muffler.
Largest stock lower pulley and smaller Porsche upper pulley for more fan  RPM.
Widest cooling fan of 35mm inside measurement.
 
Someday we would like to try a forged stroker 72 or 74mm Cw crank with  1600 
P&amp;Cs to see how it improves the torque and HP, or perhaps modify a 1800  type 
4 engine which are known to last 200,000 to 300,000 if maintained properly  
and not overheated.
 
  We also are installing 3.875 ring and pinioned freeway flier  trannies in 
our buses so we can keep up with 60 MPH traffic and not be running  over the 
3,000 engine cruising RPM we have found for us best works fo  the ACVW engine 
for both best MPG, cooling and longevity.  If you want  info on our history of 
going to the FF tranny we would be happy to Pmail you  this info.
 
  We have towed Bugs and K Ghias with our buses with 40 HP and 1641cc  
engines.  On the flats one does not noticed much differance other than  slower 
acceleration.  So much so one has to keep reminding oneself that  they are towing 
so as to not go into a hard curve/turn or stop too  fast.  On the hills we are 
definitely slower when towing them!
  With a little tent trailer that wieghs much less than a type 1. You  are 
probably going to be just fine with a 1600 with stock tranny, with FF  tranny 
1641 or bigger might be needed, but you will need to beware not to forget  and 
jackknife it.
