&gt;The type that would strive to achieve this middle-class suburban sterility
would seem like a contradiction to me if they happened to also be a VW bus

No offense, but it's just you.  Just because I'm a professional, living in
a nice suburban neighborhood certainly doesn't mean I like my VW's less
than you.
