Subject: Re: [VB] The intricacies of oil cooler seals...

&lt;&lt; Also, any of you motorheads care to give all of us your opinions as to how
 far to tighten down the three oil cooler nuts squishing the seals and 
attaching the cooler to the case?  I'm sure that you could certainly 
undertighten them, but could you overtighten the 36hp style seals also?  
Please describe your theory concerning tightening.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Bill,
7 lb. ft.  as listed in the 1960-1970 Without guesswork same as the sump 
plate studs also since both of these studs in SP engines are 6mm dia..  Later 
VW manuals list this torque value as 14 lb. ft., but do not mention this is 
for the later DP with 8mm studs and many a VW newbie shears of thier SP 6mm 
dia. stud/s. 
  As for the length of the oil cooler seals we are pretty sure that later the 
length was made longer to put these seals under more crush pressure to help 
keep them from leaking.   Eric&amp;Barb
