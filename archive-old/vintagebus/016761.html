I wish for all the world that my 62 DC was originally dove blue!  All three of the busses I own just happen to be pearl white.  Not a bad color, but I'm a bit tired of it.  

When I get to painting the 65 Westy, I've decided to use an original paint scheme from a year earlier.  The Pearl white over mouse gray will be the two colors I choose.  This bus was a European tourist delivery (picked up in Germany) so conceivably could have been ordered two tone...even though it wasn't.  So original...no.  Correct....could have been.  Looks good..._dot_definitely.
