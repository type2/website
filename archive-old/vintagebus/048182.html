Subject: [VB] Looking for a Stub Axle.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Joe. If all else fails and you cant find your stub axle from someone on 
the list, try West Coast Metric_at_800-247-3202.  I got a very nice used one, 
albeit spendy, from them a few years back. They seem to have a good selection 
of used stuff but don't advertise it. Good luck, Reed.
