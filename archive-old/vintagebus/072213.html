&gt; Using this info what would be a tire pressure that might slow down the
&gt; steering job in heavy cross winds?.
&gt; I'm currently running 30 front and 32 rear, it drives good with these
&gt; presures on days with very little wind.

Hi Stan,
#1. The tires have to be both stiffer sidewalls for the bus and wieght rated 
for at least 1525 Lbs..  
#2.  We fill the tires to thier full rated pressure on the sides of the 
radial we use, not to the 30+ year old info that is for bias ply tires and 
very early radials. 
#3.  Having stiff shocks like KYB gas shocks or thier stiffer gas adjust 
shocks does help the problem also.
