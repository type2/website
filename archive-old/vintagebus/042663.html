Subject: one halogen bulb already burnt out
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0007141200330.48774-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hi all,

My spiffy halogen taillights are great visibility wise, but one has
already burnt out. Both filaments?  Now, i was pretty careful not to get
finger oil on it (will kill a halogen) but i could have i suppose.  So i
will send it back and get another.

If this turns in to a common occurence i'll have to say that its not worth
the hassle, but having one ordinary bulb and one halogen, i can really see
the difference in visibility!

take care,

Steve
