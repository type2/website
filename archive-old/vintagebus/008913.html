&gt; Yesterday went over to Berg and picked up one of their dipstick gauges
&gt; ...
&gt; Anyone have any experience of this gauge vs. the VDOs I see on
&gt; everyone's busses...
&gt;
Hey Steve, I use a digital meat thermometer down the dipstick hole.  It
appears to be accurate.  I tried it on my ex-'54 Single Cab, which had an
oil temp sump sender and VDO oil temp gauge (300F).  They read the same
temperature.  One could argue one or both are inaccurate if one was the
arguing type.

My Bus read 227 coming back from the Classic in the 110F desert, I guess
that means that the Berg sender, if I had one, would have been blinking.  Oh
well, bye-bye OG engine.  ;(

I've driven on the freeway with my back brakes nearly frozen when the
pushrod in my Type 3 was adjusted incorrectly, causing an eventual build up
of brake pressure.  The VW was slower but the engine did not overheat.  This
was also in the CA desert in July.
