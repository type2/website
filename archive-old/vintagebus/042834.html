Ahhh.  A few months/weeks/whichever ago, the 66 poped its rear shift
linkage coupling....cruised on home in third.

Ordered one, sat ont he shelf for a few weeks, and (in the hopes of taking
it to the campout this weekend in AL) started working on it
yesterday..make that sunday...trying re replace it.

the rear screw came out fine on the old one.  But the front one wouldnt
budge.  Toasted the once-decent rear boot with the torch, while trying to
remove it.  *sigh*

So last night, I ground the head off of it, then drilled it out.  Slipped
the parts off, no biggie.  Realized that the new coupler wouldnt go in
there.  *sigh*

So this evening, I tried to remove the screw from the front coupling
(front shiftrod to rear rod..).  Snap.  Head busted right off this'n.
Great.

Now, I know I can just yank the engine and move the tranny back enough to
replace this rear coupling (and while I'm at it, replace the front mount
which I have sitting on a shelf), but I know i'm going to need to remove
that front rod at some point or another.

Is it possible for me to remove the entire 2 rod section out the rear?
(even if it means complete removal of the tranny)  Drilling this coupling
(which sits off to the side, even with the rod turned as far as it would
go...although, now that I think about it, with the shifter out, it might
turn further...) precisly wont be easy, if even possible (frame members in
close proximity.  My drill BARELY made it between the ground and the rear
coupling while drilling the last step..).  If I could take this to the
shop, and put it in the vise, and not work on my back, etc etc, I should
be able to drill it, then remove the leftovers with a pick, and not damage
the threads...(which wasnt a worry on the rear..)

I may or may not tackle this front puppy at the moment, but i'd like to
have a better idea of doing it when I do...:)

Thanks....david
