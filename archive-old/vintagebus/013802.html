&gt; It's definitely not of VW's doing.  There's no way they'd build another rear

&gt; ingress access and the aerodynamics of this bus would make a loaf or a
&gt; splitty look like a Miata.

Not only that, but how in the hell does that cargo door open?  With
the handle at the back, it must open forward, not slide, some some
big limo or somehting.
