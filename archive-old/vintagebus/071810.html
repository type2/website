Subject: Bus clock repaired!

Well, I took my broken clock out of my bus this morning to see if I could find
out why it was not working.

Found the crack in the windshield had allowed water to drip on the clock,
causing rust and corrosion to form on the innards.

The contact points that activate the solonoid thing were corroded together,
and all the springs and gears were covered in rust. I used a screwdriver to
pry the points apart, and cleaned up the contact surface, then proceeded to
drench the mechanical portion of the clock with Kroil to see if it would break
away the rust. Luckily, it took the rust away, and there was enough metal left
of the springs to make them still useable.

So the clock is ticking away here on my desk at work, connected to a
jumperpack. So far it's keeping time, i'll know for sure after the '1 hour'
test is done. Looks like it is so far (40 minutes into the test).

Probably not that big of deal to most, but I love it when things like this are
working again. I'm no clock expert by far. The only other clock i've ever
fixed was my mothers old german coo-coo clock when she decided to throw it
away (since it wasn't working). I fixed it, and now she still has it to this
day. Sucks for me, I thought it was mine since I fixed it. Oh well. lol
