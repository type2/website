I buy my plasti-gauge at a NAPA parts supply store.
I would think that any above average auto parts store would have it behind
the counter -vs- having to order it special.
Make a note of the tolerances you are shooting for prior to buying it.
Then you can be sure you get the right gauge first stop.
Each package covers a pre-set band of measurements.  It also comes with
more than enough material to do one motor.  It doesn't take much to a rod
or main journal.
I use a razor to cut them into smaller pieces and let the ends that have
been cut overhang outside of the journals so that the actual &quot;cut&quot; doesn't
get into the squish and taint the readings.
Good luck.
later
