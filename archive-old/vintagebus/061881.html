Subject: Re: [VB] how to rebuild engine video



 I second everything Rex said.  I used the Wilson book and some hints
 from Nates great site http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw/ along with great
 info from John at Top line performance in Anaheim.
 
 The one thing I'd do differently when doing it again is to go to a
 bigger displacement though I'm really happy with my C/W 1600sp.  I'd
 also have my case drilled and tapped for a full flow filter instead of
 all the hassle of making the filter pump work with my stock exhaust.
 Spend the little extra and buy a counter weighted crank and have
 EVERYTHING that rotates balanced as a unit. Balance everything else
 statically, measure deck height closely and CC your head and make them
 match. Get rebuilt (or new heads) with stock SS valves.  Upgrade to
 swivel foot adjusters (I used Berg, but they are pricey!)  Upgrade to a
 T3 oil cooler in the doghouse fan shroud or convert to the T4 and modify
 the shroud per internet/mag directions.  Use a stock exhaust if its a
 stock motor.  One more thing USE A NEW CASE!  You'll be thankful you did
 in the long run.  If you choose the new aluminum cases talk with the
 pro's who've used them before.  The Mexi case is the one I used (I think).
 
 Take your time...it'll take longer than you think.  Be CLEAN!  Have fun.
  Once you've done it you'll never be timid about fixing anything on a
 VW, except maybe the guts of a tranny ;-)
