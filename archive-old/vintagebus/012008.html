I would suggest trying mcmaster-carr, at www.Mcmaster_dot_com. It is almost impossible to get one of their catalogs, which are incredible, but you can search it over the web if you have patience. Or try calling them, I have only ordered from them once or twice, and the saleslady on the phone was very knowledgeable about hoses(for an old motorcycle I was restoring).
