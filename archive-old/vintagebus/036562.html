&lt;&lt; Is the refrigerator actually a powered refrigerator is it just an upright 
cooler?  If so, is it powered by the engine or only when a plug is in the 
side of the bus?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Depends!  The vast majority were just a ice box type cooler which could be 
hyped up with dyr ice if needed.  The very few and far between could be 
special ordered from Westfalia being propane powered!  

&lt;&lt;Same question goes for the interior outlets. &gt;&gt;

If you mean the 120AC plug, only powered when the exterior plug is connected 
to a extension cord to a 120AC outlet say at a camping ground.   Eric&amp;Barb
