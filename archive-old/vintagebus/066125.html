Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

well im working aut in the mid west right now (missouri) and i dont see many
or any vws on the road....mabee that is why
not to many shops i dunno....mabee it just a california thing ,in san jose
where i use to live there was 5 vw shops i can think if right off the top of
my head i can go to for anything, now i live in modesto and i still have 2
just in a few blocks of where im at know....now so cal is like vw heven there
is a shop on every corner...but sean i do recommend ITS they were almost half
as expensive of rancho for the same product....but i called ITS and it sounded
like he raised his prices a bit.
either way i got about 10k on my tranny and no problems.
