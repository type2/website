Subject: FW: [VB] RE: Rebuilding my Speedometer

	Well I found a substitute for the Mylar. I found plastic cake
plates that were just the right color. I cut the circles out and presto
new lenses.

Thanks again for everyones input

	PS: On a previous post I got a tip from Mike Melbrooks (Thanks
Mike) 
I was told that a popout seal will do for a vent wing window or I should
say 
windows because one pop out seal should do both vent wing window.  I
took Mike's advice and it works perfect. It is doable with regular
clamps and because it overlaps the metal is should protect better
against the rain.

Thanks Again
Eric

    Has anyone rebuilt there speedometer recently? I am looking for the
mylar that you would use for the turn signals (green). If anyone has a
lead on some it would be greatly appreciated.
