Subject: rear hatch emblem resto Q
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Is the rear hatch emblem restorable?

That is, the &quot;volkswagen&quot; script which, I understand,
is same as a type 3 for some years.

I have one I picked up at a show for 5 bucks, it still
has all four pins (or &quot;tits&quot; as the seller called them
-- yet another awesome bus part nickname)

The finish is a bit cloudy, dull, hazy. Before I get
out the Mothers(tm) and possibly rub away some OEM
finish...is there one?

Is the thing polishable? Or, is it plated?

Would I be better off to buy a Repop from WCM for $50
(I think not) or an NOS one for $30 from vintageparts?

Please advise.
