&gt; The source vehicle had the positive
&gt; cable on the positive terminal and the negative cable on the negative
&gt; terminal.  When I did, it produced a HUGE spark.  We opted to push it into
&gt; the garage rather than continue.  My helper suggested it could be positive
&gt; ground.  Is this right?

Are you sure you were on the positives? Or were you assuming the red ones
were positive? If they indeed were positives, you have a heck of a short on
the bus or a big load, one. A positive ground bus is not impossible, but it
is very close to it. Where to find the generator for such an application
jumps to mind as a large hurdle. I would see whether there is a monster
short somewhere. And make sure what cables go where. The first jumper cable
you hook up won't do anything, regardless of the voltage or ground of the
systems. The second one is where the circuit completes and you let all of
the magic smoke out of the wires. Check the cables first. Make sure which
battery terminal is which, nevermind the colors.
