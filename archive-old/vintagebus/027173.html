&gt;
&gt; One question: why is the electrical inlet on the driver's side? Mine's on
&gt; the left rear above the tail light. Is this because of the back-up lights,
&gt; which I don't have?

That's a good guess.  I have both a '65 and a early '67 (no back up lights)
Westfalia, and both of them have the electrical outlets at the left rear.
Every 67 I have seen with reverse lights has had the outlet on the side just
aft of the drivers door.  I never thought about it till you mentioned the
reverse lights...I just always thought it was a 67 only thing.

Steve
