&gt;Don't mean to ask personal questions but how much was the SP-100T and gas 
&gt;setup?  Did you hunt around?  Where did you end up buying it?


http://www.welders-direct_dot_com/ is where I got my welder. They sell it for 
$409 with FREE shipping!!!! Very good deal. The welder comes with a 4&quot; 
spool of wire, a handheld shield, and some extra tips for the gun. Plenty 
to get started with.

I  bought my gas local. I opted for a big tank and bought it outright, when 
I could have just rented. It was almost $200. When I get it filled next 
it'll run $40. But I imagine that tank will last a long time. And like it's 
been said on here before, it costs almost or the same  to fill a small tank 
as it does a big one. So I decided to make the investment up front.
