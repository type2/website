Awww, crap!  I hate that.  Don't answer where it was. 
I know by the pictures.  Man it ticks me off when a
bus is sold IN MY HOME TOWN!  I've never seen it
before though.  Not many split busses in old Lincoln
town.

sorry about the bandwidth last time.

&gt; &gt;Hi all. I just came back from NE last night with my
&gt; new bus in tow. I got
&gt; &gt;some pictures on my web-site already and will be
&gt; getting more later.
