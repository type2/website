Ok do you really believe that everyone  who has a step thinks its worth $800 
???

Do you really thing that everone even saw the ad ????

I really doubt it, but if you were planning on getting it for $20 you were 
dreaming too.......

If the seller had 10 people trying to run over and give him cash, right now, 
then it was TOO cheap !
If he is just trying to find the latest lottery winner, well thats his 
business. he may get tired of waiting and lower his price..........

check back with him in a month or two..............
