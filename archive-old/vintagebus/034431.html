&lt;&lt; how do you get the screws out without drilling + tapping ?
 
 Any tips ??????
  &gt;&gt;
whether you mean taking the windows off the bus, or the frames apart, my 
prefered method takes waiting and patience.   Soak screw areas w/ penetrating 
oil, find correct size screwdriver (very important) and tap lightly with a 
hammer.  more pebetrating oil.   Repeat daily for a week.  then try to 
unscrew the screws.  This helps to not strip them.   I live in a wet climate 
and things rust.  Window screws from dry climates are easier to get apart, 
but stripping the heads of at little one or two is easy.   Tapping gently 
helps shake the rust loose.
