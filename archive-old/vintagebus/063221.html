The epoxy I was refering to is the &quot;old spray-on bedliner&quot;. This =
technology
was replaced by the polyurethane material. It is still available though.
Apparently polyurethane is more marketable than epoxy liner. It has been
used by Ziebart for a number of years, and they can still get it. =
Ziebart is
also a Rhino Liner dealer, so chances are they'll try and sell you =
Rhino.
But if you walked into a Ziebart and said, &quot;I'm looking for the old =
epoxy
spray-on bedliner&quot;.....they'll know what your talking about.
