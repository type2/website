Today, While during a typical &quot;VW hunt&quot; through the the local antique shops,
I saw this under some junk. After digging it out, the vendor asked if I'd
ever seen such an odd thing. Who me? not me! After negotiating a price, I
told him I thought it may be German.... Has anyone ever seen these in red?
I've only seen blue.
