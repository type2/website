Subject: signing off list

Hey you guys,  I gotta go.  I'll miss you.

Just went back to college and after one week I have so much freaking homework 
it is insane.   I really like it though.  So I made the harsh decision to 
drop the list, as I barely have time to sleep.  Let alone work on my bus.  
Hope to see folks at the Oktobug etc.   You can still pmail me at this 
address.  Maybe I'll sign back on when I have my brain in a better acedemic 
working mode.

Clara
