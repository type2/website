Subject: RE: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

Hi Matt,

You are correct that white reflects heat.  But since the source of the heat
comes from inside the engine case you will want to wick the heat out of the
case using a color that absorbs heat, such as black.

The colors that reflect heat are the worst to use on a case.  For example
white, aluminum/chrome, yellow, and so on...  Unless the ambient air
temperature where you drive is above 210 degrees?  ;)

Others have commented that the paint layer will act as an insulator, which
is true if the paint is applied in a thick manner.  I think Bob Hoover
recommends black and diluting it with 40-50% mineral spirits to make it
apply thin and ultra flat.

The problem with magnesium is that the case absorbs junk and it stains so
badly.  I would rather have a clean case with a thin coat of flat black that
repels dirt better.  A cleaner case in the long run will reduce heat than
that of a dirty case all crudded up with oil and road scum.  

Take Care,
Adrian

Hi Adrian,

     Wouldnt you want the paint to be white? so it doesnt absorb heat? 
(compare white and black t-shirts on a hot summer day....)  A white case 
would prolly look cool too.....  ;)  A naked case has been recommended by a 
few friends too......

thanks!
Matt
