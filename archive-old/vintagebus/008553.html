This whole thread reminds me of a funny thing that my father did once.  He
was looking for a few acres to build his retirement home on, and we were
being shown around by a real estate agent.  Thinking my dad was the typical
American, he was showing him a piece of property.  He mentioned that it had
good deed restrictions.  My dad's eyebrows went up immediately, and he
asked, &quot;What do you mean by deed restrictions?&quot;  The realtor told him that
it meant that your neighbors couldn't do things like raising pigs on their
property.  My dad looked him square in the eye, and replied, &quot;Now mind you,
I don't have any desire to raise pigs, but I sure as hell don't want to live
somewhere where someone is gonna tell me I can't do it if I want to. on my
own property&quot;  I chuckled to myself silently, and chalked one up for my dad.

While I am on the subject, I think Lady Bird Johnson did the country a
dis-service when she started that campaign to fence in all the junkyards so
you couldn't see in.  Before that, you could ride by one and see for
yourself whether they might have a vehicle that was worth you time stopping
by and prowling around the yard a bit. Now, you have go and ask, and heaven
forbid you go in and look around for yourself.  Soon, you will be able to go
to the junkyard in your text.

I suppose those who want to live in a neighborhood, or city where a man (or
woman) can't have a parts car in plain sight have their rights, just don't
ask me to live there.  I knew there was some reason I have kept my bus
tagged, insured and registered all these years, even though she hasn't moved
under her own power in a few years.  Of course she was taking up space in
the garage.

Phew! I feel better getting that off my chest!
