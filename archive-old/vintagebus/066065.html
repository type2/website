Subject: Re: Hubley VW?

&gt;My wife saw a flyer for a local estate auction that was advertising a
&gt;&quot;HubleyVW&quot;.
&gt;It did not give a year. Does anyone know what that is?

I have a toy VW Beetle that has a metal body and plastic pan with seats.  Orange over white.  It appears to be very accurate 1/25th scale (not much 
detail), which surprised me until I saw the Hubley mark on it.  I remember a neighbor building Hubley kits (not toys) back in the 60's - they were all US 
cars from the 20's and 30's, IIRC.  Found some of them here: http://www.mafca_dot_com/hb-album.html -- but no sign of the toy Hubley I have in a few 
minutes of googling.
