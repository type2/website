&quot;A.I.R.S. is the Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad.  It also stands for 
truth, justice, and other good things man can do for his/her brethren.&quot;  
This is what I saw posted on the A.I.R.S. site, and I can provide help to 
anyone with any VW, (jack of all trades type of thing).  I can provide 
trailered towing, a 100% mechanic, and a space to work on your bus, or any 
vw, of any year for that matter.  I am willing to help anyone who will be 
appriciative, and will give what I can, see ya

Matthew Borbonus,
(The dairy farmer, with the VW attitude)
