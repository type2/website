&gt; on a vehicle which is 99.9% metric, the rims are 14 or 15 inch?

Demountable tires were invented in the UK and the US, where the dominant
measurement system was the archaic inch-pound-second system.  The wheel
diameters were defined then.

New standard diameters are measured in metric units.  The Michelin TRX
tires were in metric sizes, as were some tires used by Citroen (and
probably others)

Bicycles also tend to use metric rim diameters, as manufacturers have a
terrible habit of defining all sorts of contradictory standards.  For
example, a 20x1.5 tire is not the same rim diameter as a 20X1-1/2 tire!
To put some sanity to the system, the fractional rim is 451mm and the
decimal one is 426mm!
