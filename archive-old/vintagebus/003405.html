Here is a serious Ignorant New Guy question(s).  I just purchased a 67
westy.  I have a reference book with data like, paint codes, production
figures, etc.  The problem is this book doesn't say &quot;westy&quot;.  It lists the
following models:
Panelvan
Mirobus
Samba
Kombi
Pick-up
Ambulance
Others
Which one of these is mine?  What is the difference in these?
Thanks!
Mike
