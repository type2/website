Subject: Re: [VB] won't cold idle

&gt; bit fast, maybe 1000 rpm) So it is occillating idle. My electric choke is non
&gt; functional, but if I run back and manually adjust the stair step choke

bingo. fix the choke first.
could also be icing, i dont know how the weather is where you are.
if its icing unblocking the risers and hooking up preheat hose is a
solution.&gt;
