Subject: where does one start?

Hot VWs Magazine requires that each owner fill out a specification sheet
about the vehicle to be published. I took the time to write what I thought
would make a good article. RK Smith kindly retained the vast majority of
what was submitted.

As part of the submittal, I attempted to give credit to all members on this
and the original type2 and later Vanagon lists for their help in finding
items for the bus. Ken was mentioned as the current admin while Gerry S. was
credited for the earlier efforts. A combo of my submittal and editing
resulted in Ken helping to locate the trailer. What I meant to indicate was
that the Eriba was located partly because of the list's existence. It was an
email connection that secured the thing.

Keep looking and you will eventually find one - or possibly something
cooler! As an example someone at the June SOTO show had a really cool
trailer that was GIVEN to him! =) It was very cool.
