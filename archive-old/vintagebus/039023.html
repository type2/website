&gt;I know that they always let motorcyclists fill themselves. The
&gt;gas tank is in just too close proximity to the rider's crotch.

So mebbe get one of those life-size blow-up dummies and Velcro him up so his
crotch (or other side) is straddling the filler hole and give the fill-up
guy a big grin and say, &quot;Go for it, buddy!&quot;

Sorry Thom, I just couldn't let that one go.   :-)))
