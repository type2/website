Hi Volks,
You will also need to install a ground wire from the sender to the body to 
complete the circuit.  We are about to install a 1968-71 15 gallon gas tank 
in our 1960 panel camper conversion replacing the original 10.5+ tank.  Check 
the type2 library for details!  We might install a fuel gauge to with the 
sender in it, but either way will rely on our log book for MPG/fillup 
readings of how much fuel we have!  Eric&amp;Barb
