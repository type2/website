I hope this comes through. I guess it is time, although it makes my stomach
queasy just typing this, I am putting the 23 Window up for sale. It is the
usual excuses only they are all at once; new kid on the way, building a
house and a bunch of cars.
Any way here is the scoop:
1957 23 Window Deluxe, original paint, 15&quot; wheels, all trim, jail bars, all
three correct seats, new sunroof cover, no headliner, perfect dash (no
cuts), 6 volt clock and beautiful original Motorola radio. Has completely
new brakes including master cylinder, wheel cylinders and hoses. Inside of
brake drums paint detailed. Underside has been ground down and completely
painted using Corrolless from Eastwood. Very little rust. Original brake
light decklid with working light in good condition. Has both correct press
style bumpers with trim. Rear bumper has the correct splash guards. Rebuilt
1600 single port with new generator.runs super strong. Small nut tranny
that shifts great (could include big nut tranny as well).  Has tasteful
trailer lights for taillights. I have original units that go with it. Have
original split case tranny and 36hp complete motor to go with it. (Don't
know condition of either but good for cores at least.) This is a nice
looking bus that is very complete and very solid. It runs and drives great.
This is a very rare early deluxe that would be an excellent starting point
for a top knotch restoration. It also works excellent as is for a nice
looking super cool cruiser.
