Dear 'listees'

I have recently acquired a '67 bus that I intend to restore to its former
glory.Although I know the bus is 90% rust free,I intend to remove/strip the
complete underbody of the tar like underseal substance,just to make sure
nothing is lurking.............My question is this:1)Is there anyway of
doing this other than heat lamp, scraper and a face full of tar?

2) when it is all removed what is the preferable type of paint/sealer to
reapply,that will give the bus adequate protection against stonechips ,yet
still be asethetetically ok?

Thanks guys ,love the list.

Phil
