In Denmark we have a problem with mist inside our windows in cars, and in a
21/23 windows bus, it's a problem.
We use a electric wire to remove the mist from from rear window. That I have
in mind are, could you put a electric wire on all the windows except for the
front doors windows.
What should I be aware off, if I do this and do anybody know where to buy
this wire by the metre ?

in the Pacific NorthWest we also have that problem.  It tends to be very wet
here.    My first suggestion is make sure your heater system is working
properly.  Are all the tubes well connected without air leaks?   The fresh air
tubes likewise?   The heater cables pull both heater box vents all the way
open?     Having a thermostat also helps.     While I am driving short
distances the heater defogs the front of the bus, but not so the back until
driving for longer.   It was an option in I think 67 to have a rear window
defogger, with the wires.  THe back door froma 68 bus would fit a 67.

Since  I have been decreasing drafts  (rust repair and door seal replacement)
in my 65 westy the windows demist better.   Keeping the water out with good
window seals can't hurt either.

another option is installing an auxiliary heater, such as the eberspacher.
They heat the bus up very quickly and also defog all the windows very quickly.
