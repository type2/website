Well, took me 16 hours to tackle 800 miles but I made it...... made it home
with my &quot;new&quot; Bus in tow. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is an original owner, 59000 miles
1965 Standard. Sealing Wax over White....... I might just polish  red paint
below beltline...... done a small area, looks really good. Upper paint faded
away in a few places. I'm surprised as how little rust this baby has. A few
holes in the cab floor and a couple in the cargo area by the side door......
that's all!!! I have never seen a nose so perfect. All the inside panels and
headliner are in, everything complete down to an ashtray behind a driver's
seat, all the floor mats, spare, jack, windshield washer bottle......on and
on and on.Well, engine is in pieces in the cargo area with a brand new case
and new heads..... it's a B case....... is that a 1500cc case??? This Bus
has been sitting in a barn since 1979 (last tag on the license plate) due to
an engine problem. Now, enough said.... pictures are at:
