All,

I forgot to mention my reason for installing a piece of crap Bugpack
in the first place. More power. 

Yep and it worked, too. I was able to pull hills 10 mph faster than
normal and in a higher gear. In fact, I rarely had to shift down to
3rd at all. Those of you who've been over the Blues mtn. range in
Oregon should be properly impressed (where I only downshifted twice).

So, to all those out there who say bolt-on power is a farce, I
say...BS!!! 

As I've said before, I'm not looking for a race car, but if I can add
something to help get up those hills....I'm all over it!!!

PS-I'm exchanging/trading up to an S&amp;S exhaust.
