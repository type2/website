Subject: Re: [T2] clunking sound from fan

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Since putting the 1600 back in, it seems the fan is hittting something in
&gt; its housing.  At very low idle, or right before it shuts off, I get a random
&gt; clunk, clunking sound back there.
&gt;
&gt; While the motor was out, I replaced the generator, voltage regulator, and
&gt; starter.  I put everything back on as it came off, torqued the big nut to
&gt; spec, spun everything around and nothing was touching.  The strap is good
&gt; and tight, and fan belt is adjusted properly.  I didn't notice the noise
&gt; right away, but have driven 100 miles since, and the motor is starting and
&gt; running fine.  I took the fan belt off tonight, turned the generator and ran
&gt; engine for a minute - no clunking at all, thus the assumption it is fan
&gt; related.  My questions
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Did I miss something in the diagnosis I've done so far?
&gt; 2.  Is there anything else to try with the engine in?
&gt;
Three things to look for:

It might be that something is vibrating in resonance producing the sound.
Worst case would be a fan with a crack around the hub.  Doesn't touch at
low speeds but does touch when it spins and vibrates.  Make sure that all
fasteners are tight.

Does everything line up fine when you install it?  It might be that
tightening  the generatore strap is just enough to flex something into
contact.  All the holes should line up without having to force anything
into place.  It might be that the fan shroud is not seated correctly in
the cylinder tins, which is very easy to screw up.

Are your generator bearings OK?  Rock the top of the pulley in and out to
see if there is play in the shaft on either end.  This happened to me with
a brand new Bosch alternator.  It made a clunking sound at idle.  It made
me make pi**ed-off sounds as I was taking the thing out again!
