Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the last couple of days, there have been a
lot of NON Bus topics. Granted some of them have to do with the archives,
and what not. But all of that is out of our control. Lets get back to the
bus stuff please.

BTW: Will pre '64 front doors (refridgerator handle doors) fit on my '64?
Are they a bolt up item, or is there something that is different besides the
door handles? I know they won't be correct, but I'm trying to go for that
'early' look.

Thank you
