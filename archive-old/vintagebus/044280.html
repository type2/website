&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 Ben having a h*ll of a time trying to get my brakes ironed out.  Anyway went 
 to take my front right bleeder valve out that I thought I over torqued 
 yesterday...and it came out fine!  Upon putting it back in for another 
 bleeding attempt, half of the metal donut housing around the valve broke off 
 with half on the valve and half remaining on the backing plate.  Is this 
 repairable or do I need to score a new backing plate!  It is now impossible 
 to thread the valve back in.  I hope my dilemas offer some entertainment for 
 the veterans in exchange for the lists priceless advice.
  &gt;&gt;
sounds like you broke a piece off the wheel cylinder, which is what the 
bleeder valve screws into, not the backing plate.  SOunds like it is time to 
buy a new one.
