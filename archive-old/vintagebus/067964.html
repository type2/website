Subject: Re: [VB] Windows

&gt; Hi Jdd,
&gt; Do you have the sliders with the latches that go through the glass or not.
&gt; That makes a big differance if you are trying to match replacement glass
&gt; perfectly to the original.  As for what years will work in a 1960 it is a
&gt; real narrow era from late 1955-1967.

Hey Guys

So it appears as though the latches do not go all they way through.  It
looks like the windows I need to replace are the sliding part and the
pivoting part, the fixed part is OK.  It looks like I also need new latches
for the sliding part - or at least a piece of each latch and the latch on
the pivoting windows could also be replaced.

TIA
