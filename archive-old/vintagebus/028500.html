Howdy folks,
I need a couple of wheels (rims) for my '66 camper, these are the one with a 5 lug &quot;wide&quot; pattern.  I've checked Motorworks and Bus Depot and they don't seem to have them.  Can anyone point me in the right direction? Please don't tell me these are a &quot;hard to find item&quot;.  Also, on the subject of looking for stuff, anyone know where I can get 2 wiper arms for the aformentioned bus without payin $40 a piece??



Peace, John Baker
