&gt; It might just be because of voltage drop in the wiring.  If it goes away

Hi George,
Or better yet run the testing proceedures on section E-2, page 14 of the 
Workshop Manual Volkswagen Transporter 1963-67.  If you are having a voltage 
drop this will adversely affect the headlight brightness, turn signal 
brightness and flashing speed, and wiper speed, etc., etc...
