Hi Eric,
No offense taken!!  ;-)  We found if used correctly and not  lugging the 
engine (fourth gear we run in the 2,000 - 3,000 RPM range), that our  engines ran 
not only quieter, better MPH (5+ more than when we used to cruise at  3,800 
RPM), and ran cooler.  We also are not getting the burnt oil inside  the valve 
covers on the heads.
