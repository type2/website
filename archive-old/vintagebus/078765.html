Subject: Brake system question...

Hi all,

I'm helping a friend out with a few brake issues on a '65 Beetle.  Yeah, I
know... but the system is pretty similar to the Bus and I thought sharing the
questions with other Bus nuts might clear things up.  The brakes are fairly
new, even new drums were installed.  The brake shoes were adjusted tight, you
barely touch the pedal and they apply, sending you towards the windshield!.
In fact I suspect that they are too tight and slightly rubbing, so as I
continue, I'm going to back-off the adjustment a few teeth at each adjuster.
I'm It's a stock single master cylinder, but the installed brake light switch
is a later three terminal one instead of the correct two clyinder one.

The brake lights wouldn't operate initially.  I checked and wiggled connectors
for tightness at the fuse box. Then I discovered that both of the wires
attached to the switch had loose, poorly installed aftermarket &quot;crimp-on&quot;
connectors.  Suspecting that to be the problem, I removed them and properly
secured a fresh new pair of &quot;crimp-on&quot; connectors and now they fit tightly on
the switch connector.  The brake lights now work well, except that after
repeated testing (pumping the pedal to test the lights) ocassionally the
lights will stay &quot;on&quot; after the pedal is released.  Odd!  Sound like a
familiar symptom of something to any of you out there.

My initial guess is that there is still pressure built up in the master
cylinder and/or it's brake light switch keeping the brake lights on.  Could it
just be a matter of the wrong switch being installed?  I'm also wondering if
the previous mechanic did the brakes but did not install new rubber brake
lines and maybe fluid isn't working it's way back to the master cylinder.  But
I also assume that once you take your foot off the pedal, you have relieved
the pressure in the master cylinder on the brake light switch regardless of
what's going on elsewhere in the brake system.

Anyway, has anyone had a similar experience and what the hell am I missing
here?  Thanks for any advice on what to check.

Dazed and temporarily confused,

Bill
