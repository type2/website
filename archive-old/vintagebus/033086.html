&lt;&lt; nybody got any idea what was used to caulk those westy windows
 together, and to the body.  Its gray, flexible, and stays that way, and
 is not silicon.  I had used silicon before and I could almost not get
 them out again.
  &gt;&gt;
I think its actually a rubber seal, and I think Ronnie (oldvolks home) sells 
them.
