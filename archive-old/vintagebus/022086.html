Subject: 2500 miles in a '54 Kombi (long)
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am a simple man, &amp; don't have much time, so don't expect a lot of 
flowery verse, but here is my &quot;trip report&quot;...

There is limited useful VW info in this post and no cheap buses or parts 
for sale.
(Shawn, you can hit your delete button now...)  ;)

8/6/98
5:00am  Leave Atlanta for New Mexico in D*dge pickup (hitched a ride 
with a co-worker who was going to Santa Fe to visit his sister).

8/7/98
8:00am  Arrive in Albuquerque and try to raise &quot;Everywhere&quot; Ed from the 
dead.  Ed gives a tour of the Bus Barn and tells stories of psycho women 
he has dealt with in the past week.  (Just try to get Ed to stop talking.  
I dare you...)

10:00am  Pull the 36hp out of the '54 and put the 1600 I brought with me. 
Replace the 6v starter &amp; bushing. 

2:00pm  The 1600 has too much compression to crank by hand and the battery 
is too low to crank it over.  Go buy a new 6v battery &amp; it still won't
start.  
Very weak intermittent spark.  The barndoor is having organ donor rejection.  
Test BRAND NEW 6v Bosch coil &amp; it fails.  Put on 40 year old coil from 36hp.  
Still won't start.  Test resistence in BRAND NEW Bosch plug wires and coil 
wire and 2 spark plug leads fail.  Replace those &amp; it fires right up.

4:00pm  Realize my 6v generator is not charging.  Take the generator off the 
36hp and put it on the 1600.  This is a very easy swap in a barndoor!

5:00pm  Everything running and charging fine.  Ed is about to leave to go to 
the RMMW show in Woodland Park, CO and Denver, CO shows.  He convinces me 
that it would be a good idea to take the '54 as a &quot;shake-down&quot; trip.  He 
says Denver is about 300 miles (it turned out to be closer to 500 miles).  
We start out to go pick up a friend of his.  At the second light we stop at 
the barndoor dies &amp; won't restart.  There is smoke coming out of the 
tailpipe.  This is not good.

RULE #1.  A 36hp oilbath aircleaner does not give proper flow to a 1600.

The carb had been sucking the oil out of the aircleaner.  I also realized 
that the engine died because the old coil wire we had put on to replace the 
BRAND NEW Bosch one that was bad had vibrated off.  Put that back on &amp; it 
cranked right up.

8:00pm  We leave Albuquerque headed for Denver.  After sunset the stars 
come out &amp; it is a clear night and everything is beautiful.  Ed's bus (a 
1960 Mango Green/Seagull Grey Standard that has been converted to an 
extended flat-bed crewcab) has 1967 type 1 running gear, so I climb right 
past him in the barndoor going up hills, but he is waiting for me down 
hills and on flats.

The moon rises and it is a beautiful full moon.  We could have easily 
driven without headlights.  We stop at the Rest Area just north of the pass 
before you get to Santa Fe.  I check the dipstick and the engine is running 
as cool as you could imagine.  I thought it would be hot after that hard 
climb, but it was perfectly normal.  We used the facilities and were amused 
by the poll they were taking inside the rest room.  There were two traffic 
light pedestrian button boxes on the wall with a sign asking you to press 
the appropriate button to indicate whether you approved/disapproved of the 
condition of the facilities.

I-25 in northern New Mexico is long and straight and you can see for miles.  
The string of headlights from opposing traffic looked like a continuous 
string of Christmas lights, but it would sometimes be 5-10 minutes before 
you met any cars.  Coming over a pass and seeing all the lights from a city 
in the valley below was another treat.

8/8/98
1:00am  Ed is tired &amp; decided we should stop for the night at a truckstop.

9:00am  Back on the road

12:00pm  Going through Colorado Springs the coil wire vibrates off again.  
I get it back on &amp; eventually catch up to Ed.

1:00pm  Arrive at the RMMW show.  The guy at the gate says, &quot;That's an old 
one.  It's about a '59 or '60 isn't it?&quot;  Obviously not a bus guy.  He 
directs me to park in a distant dirt lot.  Later I move it into the show 
area, but I didn't register.  I wanted to keep an eye on it because all my 
tools were in it.  There were a few nice cars at the show, but for the most 
part I was not impressed.  They didn't have a swap meet (I guess they thought 
used parts being sold would cut into RMMW sales).

5:00pm  Leave Woodland Park for Denver.  When we arrive in Denver we go to 
Black Bear campground (or whatever it was called) across the road from the 
Speedway.  Needed to use the restroom, but balked when I saw they were pit 
toilets and someone had vomited on the floor.  Decided to wait for dark to 
take a &quot;nature hike&quot;.  We camped with another guy from Albuquerque in a 
SO-42 Westy (he was one of the Bus Co-Op guys) and a guy from Missouri in 
a bubble-window bus.

8/9/98
7:00am  Decided to see if they had cleaned the restroom.  In addition to 
the vomit, someone had taken a dump in the urinal and someone else had bad 
aim &amp; smeared the toilet seat.  I decided I could wait again, but Ed had to 
go, so he used his best hovering technique.

RULE #2  There is a reason for the sign asking you to put the lid down on 
the pit toilets.

While Ed was hovering, a woman left the restroom on the other side without 
putting the lid down.  Both sides use the same pit and when her door 
slammed shut, Ed got a rush of methane that almost made him pass out.

8:30  After waiting in two lines finally got into the speedway for the 
show.  I ran into a friend from Virginia who had ridden out with a friend 
in a show car and wondered if he could vend at the swap meet out of my bus.  
So if any of you were at the Denver show &amp; saw the teal blue '54 Kombi 
with all the tie-dye tee shirts hanging on it, it was my bus but HIS shirts.  
I don't own a single item of tie-died clothing (not that there is anything 
wrong with that...)

That night we crashed at a friend of Ed's in Denver and I got to take a 
shower (the first of a total of 3 oveer the course of 14 days).

I'll post more later as time permits...

Dave
