Just arrived back in Phoenix thursday so eyes are very bad!!please
excuse spelling-----here is a brief run of my run again to Bad Camberg--

after driving back from Das Classic sunday night--left monday to fly to
London--
meet up with the Fab Four!!
1950 split with original 25hp--1952 with original 25hp--1953 Zwitter
with original 25hp
and a 1964 21 window that was restored from the ground up--removing
rust--replacing panels, --rebuild motor--trans--upholster
interior--paint--ONE guy did this in his shop in FOUR months!!!
we drove under the channel in the chunnel!!
a breakdown of the rare models besides the splits and ovals-- at the
show--roughly--
5 split dash cabrios!! these are more rare than a heb!!  18 hebs PLUS a
few more --might have hit 22!! 3 schwimmers, 3 Paplors, 1 Enzmann, 1
SP2, 3 Rometsch,2 Danhours,1 Drews, 1 Platwagon--
i got to drive a 47 split--owned by Otto Wymann who has a split in the
Museum --
a signed letter from Johann Beastkow, who worked on the Rometsch--made a
deal on 3 KDF pins--i found most of the prices surprisingly low? My
thing is VW history and not parts--so i added a lot to my
collection--located a 1970 German ladder truck in England
for a very low price--PLMK if anyone is interested in this truck--??
Took a video of the show and the presentation to Mr. Lottermann --runs a
little over an hour--also have a one hour Classic week-end tape--Das
Classic had a killer bus display--My only bad thought on the show is
that when i heard loud foul language--it was from the Americans--sort of
made you feel you were at Pomona! Bad Camberg has grown and
grown--sunday was a little slow as a lot of people went to a show in
Holland--But this proved great to do a Video on the 47 and a most
beautiful 50 split Cabrio, the Lottermann family says Bad Camberg will
be back again--Mr. Lottermann is one of the finest people i have ever
meet--Yet--he was the victim a the theft of 6 rare license plates friday
night when he opened his collection to the public.  No doubt the
hospitality of the German people is hard to beat--I have only been to 2
Bad Camberg shows--yet the regulars seem to remember us when we
return--I was able to get a lead on 3 splits for sale and 2 barndoors
and another 43 KDF--But---money is not deep enough to make my dreams
come true---
But at Bad Camberg---this is the place VW dreams are made, and we all
must have a dream to keep us going--UJ
