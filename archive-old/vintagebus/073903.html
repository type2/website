Subject: Re: [VB] blinker troubleshooting

Hi Don,
First install a ground wire system for the taillights to the battery ground 
strap to get the best lighting.  Next take your signal switch apart from the 
steering column and look for a wire broken off inside.  If it is it just 
needs a soldering to correct or perhaps it just need a good cleaning to 
remove corrosion in the contact points with electronics contact cleaner, 
perferably with a silicon sealant in this cleaner.  If all this does not work 
try bybassing the suspect wire with another wire and see if things work then. 
 If so you need to replace that single wire going into or out of the switch.  
Do not grease up the switch, doing this will cause the switch not to hold in 
a signal position without you having to hold it by hand.
  You probably can not use the 1965 bus switch unless it was manufactured in 
the first month of 1965 model year, because it was changed after that time.  
Check the bus parts manual at vintagebus_dot_com for specifics.
