&gt; Where is Dash Point?
&gt; 
Hi Clara,
Basicly it just North of the Fedal Way exit.  As you travel N. or S. on I-5 
there are brown background signs for the park.  You head West for about 3-5 
miles to a T intersection which you turn right.  Then another T-intersection 
less then a mile later where you turn left and the park is on both side of 
the road about a mile or less later.  
We had a good time camping there before last Puyallup Springmeet after 
getting there early on Saturday morning.
For our Springmeet camping report try:

The wet Westies have tried to camp out at the Puyallup fairgrounds for the 
last three or so meets and have been hassled with towing threats, or 
overcharged for full hook up camping spots in a lack luster grassy lot with 
no bathrooms, or ruled out by the local officials (IE now they claim you can 
not use thier camp spots unless you have a full bathroom in your camper.).

For more official Dash Point State Park info try:

and there is a second page at:
