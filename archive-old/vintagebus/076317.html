Subject: Fun with Barndoors !

Well,  after watching two old VW vans for more then 23 years, they finally
came up for auction via the Public Trustee.

Bought tonight was a '53 Barndoor Deluxe last driven in 1975, 85% complete
with all parts ( including original upholstery middle and back seat in
pristine condition, 6 - 16&quot; rims. semaphores, complete Deluxe dash, crank
start handle, etc. ). It does have rust that will require work but how many of
these do we ever see sold these days?? Also had some old Polaroid pictures of
the same '53 in Florida in the '60s. If is restored in it's original light
beige/dark brown colors it will look great!!

And my own personal buy was a '54 Kombi barndoor with camper kit and rare
opening rear hatch last driven in '77. So Christmas comes early, and I will
have fun cleaning it up to see where I end up with this project.

Bunch of NOS Parts went as well and I bought some used cargo doors for my '67,
with no rust and velvet green looks like it was just sprayed on yesterday.

What was even better was the four of us locals bidding on this stuff, ......it
was clean and great comparing notes after....I am sure the previous owner,
although reluctant to sell in his lifetime, would be proud that they ended up
with true VW enthusiasts.

PIctures to be posted on the Samba soon!

Scott
