&lt;&lt; I don't find any info in the Bentley manual about adjusting the shifter, 
so is it done the same as the bay window bus shifters? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
We are sure it is.  The main thing to remember is that all adjustments must 
be made with the fact that the part of the shifter below the cab floor moves 
opposite of the upper part of the shifter!  In other words when you shift 
forward into first you are moving the lower shifter and rod backwards.  So if 
it is not shifting far enough forward to get into first you have to shift the 
shifter base toward the rear!  Same is true with the shifter side to side 
movement which rotates the shift rod linkage.  If it does not shift enough to 
the right you have to move the shifter base to the left and vise versa.
