Subject: Re: [VB] SO-22 &amp; 33

&gt; I believe Kyle Tillman has a set of plans for the
&gt; Mosaic camper interior from the one he rebuilt
&gt; (fabricated?) for the Jerome raffle bus a couple years
&gt; back.  Kyle, want to sell copies of the plans?  I sure

Thats cool.
I would consider exchanging some shekels for a decent set of plans.
