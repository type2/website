hey all,
i have adjusted my brakes twice in the last 5 mos. of summer driving. after 
each time my bus will stop on a dime! BUT, after a few weeks each time, my 
brakes go further and further back to the floor. whats happening, are the 
adjusters pulling the shoes back in? if i pump them twice when i need to 
stop, they really grab, so i know they are backing off. i took the drums off 
and the shoes arent that bad. i dont get it.
thanks,
Bob Margiotti
