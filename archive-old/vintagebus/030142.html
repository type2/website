Regarding carb spacers...
I've had to mess with this issue numerous times for various reasons....
Buses that originally came with governors came with intake manifolds that had
a shorter neck.  This allowed space for the governor to sit and not mess
anything up with the accelerator cable or with air cleaner clearance.  I
believe that the governors were used in the mid 60's.  If one uses a longer
neck intake manifold and tries to cram a governor on there...then the
accelerator cable will not line up right and depending on the type of air
cleaner, it will not line up right.  When using a short neck intake manifold
and no governor...one can run this as long as the engine is set up for 6V.
If one has a 12V generator on it then the accelerator pump on the carb will
hit the generator *unless* you use a carb that is a 28PCI or earlier (with
the accelerator pump on the rear...facing you when you look at it while its
on the engine)  I've made a couple of the spacers myself (
http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/spacer.htm )  the last one that I made was a
custom height and I only had less than 1/8&quot; in height tolernace to work
with...if it was not within the tolerance...either the carb would hit the
generator or the air cleaner (62 bus...with triangle bracket) would not fit.
Also when using a governor or spacer one must get the longer carb studs.
I've run a spacer on my 71 bus almost since I bought it... due to the short
neck intake manifold.
Maybe some of this is useful....maybe just rambling...  either way..hope it
helps!
