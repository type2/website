Subject: line boring, hammered cases

Volks

What is the story with line boring cases? How many times can
a case be cut before it is scrap?

Why do heavily bored cases not last -- my experince is they
soon develop excessive end float on the crank, eventually
leading to one or another form of early death.

The engine builders here in SA are boring cases out by up to
3mm.

I read somewhere once that when the VW factory was
rebuilding engines on exchange they would scrap any case
that needed boring???

The engine that flaked out in my 75 Fleetline &quot;Ratmobile&quot; on
my recent return from Cape Town had excessive end float
about 2,000km after rebuild. It was on 10,000km when we
stripped it after the Cape Town trip, and the front main
bearing showed signs of being pushed back and forth, and the
case was hammered at that point. It had a 1mm cut on it.

Any case and line bore experts out there?
