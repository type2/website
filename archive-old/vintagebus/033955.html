g a friend with a 67.....

now the problem

try as we may the rear drivers turn signal refuses to work. all 3 other flash 
happily. turn on the flashers and all 4 flash. with all 4 flashing I am under 
the assumption that the wiring to the light is good. including the fuse too. 
do I assume too much? I am leaning towards the flasher. I have reseated all 
the connectors on it. removed the fuses cleaned and turned over swapped 
locations etc.

any thoughts? and to answer the question, no. I do not have a diagram for a 
67. 68 thru 71 I have. I'll be getting a new manual soon.

since the flashers flash I would expect it would be between the flasher unit 
and the taillight.  Double check that brake light works.   Cleaning the 
terminals on the taillight never hurts.   Thom Fitz P has wiring diagrams 
posted on his webpage- down load that and trace the circuit from the flaser 
to the taillight.  You can use a test light-   ie check the wire at the 
taillight to see que pasa.
