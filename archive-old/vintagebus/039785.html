hello again,

thank you for all for your help.
  I took all the zerks out and cleaned out the  threads that they go in. I 
cleaned off the kingpins.  I had my father turn the wheel while I pumped 
grease.  It seemed to maybe take a little grease but still none came out.  
It was the same two zerks on both sides that would not take grease.  I took 
it out for a 15 minute drive thinking that it might work up the grease.  
Come back still nothing.  I spent 5-6 hours on it so i was not rushing 
either.

I called a acvw specialist today.  He thinks that maybe the kingpins will 
have to taken out and remachined.  When I first got the bus 7000 miles ago 
it pulled all over the road .  After going to 2 mechanics (one of which 
knows vdubs) they both said that the kingpins were in too tight and They 
would break in.

    7000 miles later the bus does pull a little.  It has gotten much better 
though.    So my question is &quot;Do you think that they will get worn in enough 
so that i can grease them or will they seize first?


thanks again
