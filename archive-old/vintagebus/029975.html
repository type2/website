Hi Kevin,

A key is used because of how a shaft is made. The process is turning,
and it's done on a lathe. That means the metal that's going to be the
shaft is held in a machine by one end and usually supported at the other
end. The lathe then turns the metal while a cutting tool removes metal
from the surface until what's left is the shaft you want. It isn't
possible to do this and have a raised spot on the shaft. To make a
raised spot, you machine a slot in the shaft after it is turned and then
insert a key.

Introduction to machining. 8^)
