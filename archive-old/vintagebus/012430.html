You buy, borrow,  or beg a copy of the Idiot's guy, and immediately
turn the the chapter labelled &quot;red light on!&quot; and start from
there.

You also bum a ride to the closest VW flaps, and buy plugs, points,
condensor, cap, rotor, oil, feeler guage, new fan belt, and
oil sump gasket kit.

Saturday morning, get up bright and early, and do a full tune up
including adjusting the valves and changing the oil.  By this time you
have the book, and you'll know how to do it.

Between the tune up procedure, and the red-light procedure, you should
have a sweet running bus by saturday afternoon.

        Okay, you have a new old factory 12v 66 Kombi with a 1600 single
port sitting in your garage. It's been shipped via truck some 2000 miles.
After re-attaching the ignition wire to the solenoid, she starts, runs a bit
choppy. After it warms up, it stalls. Worse, there's a red generator light
on. You look at the fan belt and see it is ready to fly off, so you remove 5
shims and tighten it. But the G-light keeps glowing. You vow to get her
runnin' smooth and get that light to shut off over the weekend.
