Is it in California? If yes, and if it was towed under
the abatement law then they can only sell parts off
it. The Calif abatement law specifically says that the
vehicle can only be parted out and then crushed.

Other states may have the style of laws on their
books.

 &quot;no Problem&quot; to title
 issue &amp; hope to still save it. Stay tuned.

 Update: The Pick &amp; Pull will not sell this bus
 whole. Has anyone else dealt
 w/ this issue.  It is to nice to strip &amp; crush or
 cut up.
