If you spin it by hand, does it go smoothly or is there any roughness
or resistance to the motion?

When I've had this, it's always been an off-center TOB or
clutch/pressure plate misalignment.  Check the throw-out arm, and
verify that the springs/fingers on the clutch are all at the same
offset/height.  Wouldn't hurt to make sure the friction plate's
actually the same thickness all the way through, either.
