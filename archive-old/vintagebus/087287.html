&gt; I was cruising down the road on Saturday in my &quot;new&quot;
&gt; 72 Westy when this stupid teenager in his big old
&gt; Thunderbird pulls thru a stop sign and directly into
&gt; my path...WHAM!!! The Westy nailed him doing about 45
&gt; MPH!! The good news is that me, my wife, and my
&gt; stepson were all un-injured,

thank god everyone is ok, what about the &quot;stupid teenager&quot;??
buses are tougher than they look, eh?

&gt; HOWEVER, the bad news is
&gt; that the nose of the bus got CRUNCHED!!!! Probably not
&gt; fix-able

well I wouldn't give up oon it so fast. might surprise you, let someone
like the Metal wiz give you an estimate to take to the insurance company.

&gt; :-(  So now I have to fight with this kid's
&gt; insurance company to try to get a fair settlement and

use the &quot;antique and classic&quot; car list of values and the Samba list not
just kelleys blue book that they will try to use. I've had that fight with
someones insurance company and it is winable.

&gt; buy another bus.  Soooo, anybody got a decent bus for
&gt; sale near the Midwest or Southeast??  I'd prefer a
&gt; 68-71 westy but will consider all.  Does NOT have to
&gt; have a running engine (I have 2) but I'd like it to be
&gt; otherwise road-worthy with a decent body.  I live near
&gt; Cincinnati, Ohio but will travel for the right deal.
&gt; Depending on the insurance settlement, I may have only
&gt; a few grand to spend. Sooooo, can anyone help out a
&gt; long-time bus brother?!?!?
&gt; PEACE! John Baker

hopefully in the light of day it might just need a new nose and front
bits, especially if the vehicle has no damage past the front torsion
tubes.

good luck and glad everyone is ok,.... what your neck is sore??? sorry
couldn't resist
