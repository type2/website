Subject: RE: [VB] gas in oil

i don't think the flange will be the solution to your gas-in-oil. more
thanlikely the fuel pump diaphragm.
as to getting the piece out of the case, do it carefully. i have had to run
a tap into it, grab onto the tap with a vice-grip, and hammer on the vice
grip. sometimes this works, other times it breaks. it really is a
hit-and-miss situaion.
just be sure to get the really big chunks, and if you notice a piece has
fallen in the case, run it and then change the oil and remove the screen to
get it out. \good luck, been there a few times.

&gt; hey group, last week i asked what would be causing gas get into the
&gt; oil...well i got my answer today.  the intermediate flange is
&gt; broken...the bottom half (the tube going down into the engine) has
&gt; broken  off is stuck in the hole.  		HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE?  HOW
&gt; DO YOU GET THE DARN THING OUT?
