&gt; so the whirring noise i hear is probably the starter spinning, it is just
&gt; that the solenoid is not pushing the starter gear(which i guess is called
&gt; the bendix) into the flywheel. if the solenoid were the only thing
working,
&gt; all i would hear would be the click of the solenoid kicking in.


The pivot which controls gear function from the solenoid movement
must also be positioned correctly inside the starter to properly actuate
the bendix drive. You will have to disassemble the starter to verify this
and make the correction. Next time it will be easy.
