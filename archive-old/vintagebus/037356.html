Hi Gerald,
First off you always have to take case numbers with a grain of salt.  You
could buy a engine case with no numbers to replace your old original engine
case and be able to number your new engine case the same.  Why?  Because some
states here in the USA went by the engine number not chassi number to
identify an automobile and it was actually a crime to replace the engine with
another engine that had been already numbered and used in another auto unless
the proper paper work was filled out first!

&lt;&lt;Is there a spot on the web where I can look up the engine numbers and find
out?&gt;&gt;
Try the Idiot's Manual by John Muir for the engine number.  Though we can
tell you it probably is not due to not having the 1-XXX XXX number that the
25 HPs had.
