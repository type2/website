Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

John,

Not sure about the tin, but it would seem any late model tin would seem to
fit nicely. As for the heat, for lack of a better term, I call them 'heater
mufflers'. I attached mine to the heater tubes on the Bus using the stock
clamps and 13mm head bolts and then used some fresh air hose, 3&quot; ID, to
attach to the heat exchangers. To connect the fresh air hose to the heater
mufflers, I used 3&quot;OD PVC pipe, a couple of worm drive clamps and it flows
nicely.
Good luck,
Gary

So ... I'm having a couple of problems.  I'm planning on putting a 1641 into

my 60 - it currently has a 40 hp engine.  What tin will I need?

Also - what do people use to attach the heater things to the bus in a 60. 
I'm currently using that flexible foil stuff - but that ain't right - ideas?
