&gt;I would disagree that towing at freeway speeds is unsafe, given the proper
&gt;equipment and that your bearings in the bus in tow are all good.

I agree.  It's kind of a relative thing because it's only as safe as you
make it.  Traveling 75 to 80 though with a vehicle that was designed for 60
to 65 max. when it was new on top of having any worn out bearings or
drivetrain parts would not be a good idea though.

&gt;I wouldnt use a dr. joe towbar on the highway.  I plan on either making my
&gt;own that attaches to the front beam but is wider and better braced, or
&gt;doing what others have done quite successfully...


I see your point - those little fingers on that towbar aren't too impressive
but they do the job at least for the first few tows.  I guess there is
always a better way to make something...

As long as we do things safely, it all ought to work out.

Keep on dubbin' man!
