Greetings, Volks...

I've noticed this thread for the past couple of days, but only checked
it out this morning...

I'm a mechanic at Vintage Auto (formerly Vintage Volkswagen) in
Greenville, SC. I've had this job for about a month now... After working
on my own several VWs for years as a hobby (3 beetles, a 412 wagen, and
3 buses... does an Audi 100LS count? What about friends and girlfriends
VWs?), now I'm getting paid for it! It's like a dream...

We service and sell VWs and Hondas and sell parts and accessories. I get
to work on most of the buses that come in, because I know a little more
about them, or maybe it's just my enthusiasm...

Its cool getting to meet the bus people around here, since I just moved
into town and am trying to make new friends... Stop by and say hi!
