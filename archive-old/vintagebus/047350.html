My 57 standard has writing in there too. Its color scheme was L311/L312.
It says &quot;HELL&quot; (Yes, hell)
Not sure what this means in german but,
A long time bus guru friend of mine said he remembered pulling headlights out 
of a mid 60ies bus in the junkyard and written in the bucket said &quot;F*#K USA&quot;.
I wish he would have grabbed that noseskin!

&lt;&lt;My birth certificate says &quot;special color&quot; or &quot;special option&quot; as well.
It denotes from the factory the Deluxe colors. In my case it's Chestnut
Brown and Sealing Wax Red. Biege Gray is the top color on Deluxes for
59. My RH headlight bucket says SPOR or probably SPOP which sounds like
it means &quot;Special Option&quot; in my case. I can't figure out the last letter
that well but &quot;P&quot; makes sense. &quot;Special Option&quot; is what the factory
called Deluxes, although I'm not sure how long this lasted.
