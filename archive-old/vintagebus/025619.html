&gt; Old fuel in a 30-PICT carb turned to glue and blocked all the drilled

&gt; avail.
&gt; 
&gt; Is their some secret cleaner that can unblock all the tiny passages in a
&gt; carb, or should I just toss it and buy a new Brazilian 31-PICT?

Fig,
 Forget the snake oil sprays. Rebuild it!
When a carb is rebuilt, it shouldd be disassembled, and put in a solvent
made for carburetors, preferably in a mchine that agitates. Buy a $10
rebuild kit, dissasemble the entire thing, and take all the parts in a
baggy to a shop you trust and have them put it in a basket in their
parts agitator for a while, maybe an hour or two. We do this regularly
for folks for about $2. Free if we like them, and their bus doesn't
stink of patouli. 
After you get it out, ask them to blow out all the passages and jets
with compressed air. Make sure either you or they pull out the little
plug with the bee-bee inside it...Whats this called anyone?
Then follow the diagram on the carb kit and put the thing back together
with the new gaskets and diaphrams. Its kinda like a jigsaw puzzle, but
its a lot more fun. Don't lose any pieces, or if you do call me as I
have boxes of parts carbs.
