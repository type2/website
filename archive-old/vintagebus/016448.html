No Mike, you are right. The *roof* panels behind the
driver/psgr are two pieces. What I was refering to was
the long wall on the driver's side. That wooden piece
along that wall (under the windows) was originally one
piece from the rear side of the seat bulkhead back to
the forward side of the rear wheel well. The trick on
that piece is to get the right wood, in the correct
one piece shape while maintaining a vertical
woodgrain.
