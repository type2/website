Subject:  RE: [VB] OP relief valve identification.
Date: Mon, 7 Feb 2000 14:43:32 +1030 

All type3 engines have two of the non grooved
valves (at least all I've seen).  I've never seen a written explanation as
to why but, from memory, I think I nutted out it that it might
take less pressure to activate the oil control valve for some
reason.  Type3 engines (suitcase tin) normally run hotter than the type1
configuration and I'm not sure whether the different valves were maybe a fix
for that problem or a cause - good case for empirical testing
might be a solution for too hot engines? (might cause em too!)

The springs are different though and you have to get the right spring in the
right hole!
Unfortunately I'm at work and can't quote from memory which goes with which.

&gt; Hey all - I've got a question about the op relief valves I installed in my
&gt; engine.  They are the ones that came out of this engine.  Both of the
&gt; valves
&gt; are identical in size.  Yet when checking the RMMW catalog (the one with
&gt; the
&gt; blue 70's bug on the front) they show on page 22 a set of springs,
&gt; washers,
&gt; plugs, and relief valves.  One valve has a groove around the top (pictured
&gt; on the left) and the other one doesn't (right).  Both of mine look like
&gt; the
&gt; one one on the right.  Is this correct or so I have a botched OP valve in
&gt; my
&gt; engine?
