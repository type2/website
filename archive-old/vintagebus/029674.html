Subject: re: parking lights

It probably doesn't matter what year bus it is, if someone in the past
has changed the light switch. When I went to replace mine , I found two
without a #57 terminal  before I found one with. If I hadn't found one
that day I would have just gotten the one without and ran them with the
tailights. I was told that is how all the other switches are ran.
