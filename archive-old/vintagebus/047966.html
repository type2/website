Hello,
I have a 67 bus that sat out for 8 years and the windows on the sunny side
look like they have been acid etched. This comes off with steel wool, But i am
concerned that I will be scratching the glass if I go to hard on it. Any
suggections on getting this stuff off and geerally getting glass to a nice
luster?
