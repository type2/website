Subject: Re: [VB] Speeding, Cooling, and Over-reving

fuel guages are options, right.. you don't need one.   get a speedo at a 
swap, and replace it... not a big deal.

, I branded myself on the dipstick at one stop.  I would love to have a tach, 
oil pressure gauge, and temp gauge and ammeter.  But I've set my sights 
lower... The speedo doesn't work and the fuel sender isn't sending, so I hear a 
nightmare awaits me (requiring cutting or something).  I read you guys discussing 
the sender replacement process before I picked up this bus and thought &quot;boy, 
I'm sure am glad I don't have that problem....&quot;
