Subject: washings on shock mounts

First of all, I'd like to thank those who provided me input, both on and off 
the list, a couple of weeks ago regarding shocks for my 1966 transporter.  I 
decided  to splurge for the Bilsteins, mainly because I really like the 
&quot;controlled&quot; ride (that's a euphemism for hard ride :-) they provide on another 
car.

The front Bilsteins come with two knurled washers.  It really doesn't look to 
me like there's an appropriate place for these sorts of washers.  Maybe on the 
top bolt?  It previously had a lock washer under the nut and no washer under 
the head of the bolt, which looks fine.  Maybe a thick flat washer under the 
head of the bolt would be nice.

Should there be any washers at all on either side of the shock on the lower 
mounting stud on the fronts?  Once again, maybe some sort of washer under the 
nut looks like it might be nice, maybe a lock washer or a thick flat washer, 
but not a knurled washer.

The rear shocks didn't come with any washers at all.

Any insight is appreciated on what sort of washers are appropriate in which 
location.

thanks,
	Mark, markt_at_duke_dot_edu
