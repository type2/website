Subject: Polorizing a new generator

I just purchased a new generator and regulator form my 60' kombi.  The question i have concerns the generator.  The instructions with the generator (Bosch rebuilt) indicate to leave the regualtor hooked up and to jump the B+ to 61.  I'm a llitl concerned keeping the regulator hooked up.  Also using bently, I'm a bit confused on which wire is considered the + side and which one is the - minus side.  Both are red, both are the same thickness.  If facing the regulator, is the one connected on the left considered the + side?  The other side has two wires comming out of the generator.  One on the wires is connected directly to one of the brush carriers.  Any help would be appreciated.

Mike
