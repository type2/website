Well, looks like the master cylinder is the prob.  While I'm down there 
replacing that, any suggestions on what else I should do?  My steering is a 
bit sloppy too.  Oh and there were only 4 bolts on the pan, guess I should 
geet some more of those.

It's a '66 Kombi w/ a single circuit cylinder I think, it's pretty crusty 
looking.

Guess I need a source for a replacement, unless autozone, pepboys or Napa 
would have the part.  I live near Fresno, I think that there is a place in 
Clovis.

Looks like no bus driving till this weekend.
