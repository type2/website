Subject: 67 door mechanism operation?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi.

I was checking out the 67 owner's manual on Everett's
site and noticed that to open the cab doors you pull
the (toilet flusher style with handle end pointing up
and slightly forward) door handle back, and to lock it
from inside you push it forward, toward the front of
the car.

Well on DARTHVW it is the exact opposite. You push
forward to open, and pull back to lock.

Is it possible that the mechanisms were switched. i.e.
passenger side put in driver's and vice-versa?
Are they switchable like that?
