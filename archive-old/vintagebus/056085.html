&gt; Hey, I paid a lot of money for that poster.... MOMA and the like make good
&gt; money and make good with advertising with works of art they own.
&gt;
&gt; ... and I'm not trying to be a *prick* either.... like I said, I think
this
&gt; whole thing comes down to courtesy.  If you use an image from the web, get
&gt; permission first.

&gt; Im not trying to be a prick, but its not like i copied your web page, I
&gt; copied an image that you most likely did not ask VWOA permission to use in
&gt; the first place .and that is very relavant in ths matter , you your self
&gt; have &quot;stolen &quot; that image and are using to sell items. I respect the fact
&gt; that you took the time to put it online and that it is available to view,
&gt; but dont complain about someone doing what you have done.
