I have been driving my 61 side loader for a week now, 40hp engine, totally
stock, internal oil cooler, no internal shroud flaps, has the flap that
covers the fan intake, temps have been in the low 120's, went on a nice
highway cruise, got it up to 60 mph,humidity in the 60's/70's, it was nice
like cruising in a rolling sauna, I'll be slim and trim by Jerome, Taking
the 60 DD, looking for drivers to take the 61 side loader up there and plan
to have the 57 single cab ready also and if all go's right will need someone
to drive the 68 dormobil (new find) up there for me also. Nut's, it's in how
you look at it, If I didn't drive one of my buses I'd have to drive my Fo#d
4X4, no thanks, I like 20mpg plus over 7-8 mpg when running the air.

ronnie

ps. how else would I tell if my buses overheat if I didn't drive it in the
heat?
no problems yet.

I have been listening to all the talk the last couple days about cooling
problems and I think that you Arizona guys must absolutely be crazy to drive
an aircooled VW in the summer without AC.  I always park my aircooled VWs
when it gets over 80 (my maximum comfort level) and I also park them when it
snows only because the Chicago salt wreaks havoc on floorpans and such.
That is why I have the New Beetle...to help preserve my old VWs.

Luckily we are having the coolest summer in ages to I am driving them a lot.
God I hate hot weather!!
