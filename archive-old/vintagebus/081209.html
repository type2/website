Subject: need for freeway flyer?

Hi all,

If I have a '65 bus with a 1600 engine, should I be able to cruise
comfortably at 65-70 with a top speed of over 75mph with a stock tranny?
Even at the top end speed, it doesn't sound like the engine is winding
out too high. I had thought I wanted to get a freeway flyer or something
like it, but I'm wondering if my bus has already been modified in some
way.

Thanks,

SLOJason
