I'm not able to check the archives at the moment, but was hoping someone
would have a quick answer.

1)  Is a 6 foot roof rack an original VW size?
2)  Was it of the same construction as the ever popular but not as
practical &quot;show size&quot;?  (Wood slats, etc.)
3)  Is there a re-manufacturer of such?  An old PIP catalog I have show
the small one, and mentions a full size, but I don't really want either. 


Thanks for your help!
