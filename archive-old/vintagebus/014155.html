Message-ID: &lt;19991130192211.53299.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hello out there,

Does anyone know of a source for new plastic trim to go around the cabinet 
doors on a 67 westy?  I can find the type that surrounds the tables and 
trims the spice rack but I can't locate any of the type that surround the 
closet door.  Also does anyone know of a source for the interior plastic 
trim that goes around the bottom of the poptop canvas?  Any help on this 
would be greatly appreciated.
