Subject: Sunday incident

Well I finally got finished with all the funeral and arrangements 
that had to be tended to. Thanks for all the kind comments from the 
list. Enough of that...

When I got home I found a box from Ronnie at http://www.oldvolks_dot_com 
that had me a brand new Bocar 34 PICT carb in it. So I pulled it out 
and put it on. I fired up the engine and it ran good, proper idle, 
much nicer. I looked at the time and saw I had just enough time to go 
to a shop seminar our local VW club was doing, so I didn't make a 
single adjustment to the carb. Just went ahead and took off.

I live about 20 miles from town. I drive my bus to and from work 
everyday. So it ends up being about 50 miles a day with 40 being 
highway miles.

Just as I was getting to town today for the club meeting, my bus 
started shaking and making noise. I immediatly pulled onto a side 
road and hopped out. I did a quick check of all the wheels...no flat. 
So I got back in and started driving again to try and figure out what 
it was. Just as I was going about 20 mph, the front driver side of 
the bus SLAMMED into the ground! I turned my head and looked out the 
drivers window only to see my tire taking off in the field next to me 
going very far very fast. When I got out and looked, I saw that the 
drum was still in place. My lug nuts had simply backed out. ?????

I trekked into the field about the distance of a football field and 
found my wheel. Looked fine. Even still had 3 of the lugnuts in the 
hubcap that was still on it.

So to make a long story short, I did the roadside fix. The drum was 
slightly bent. So I backed off the brakes on that wheel to allow it 
to rotate without risitance. I put the wheel on and headed to the 2nd 
half of our club meet at the park.

After a few beers and a lot of chatting I headed home. Now I've gotta 
figure out exactly why it all happened. I've never had this 
before...so don't know why. I guess that's a new one for me to keep 
on my checklist. With the hubcaps on, you almost seem to forget about 
the lugnuts. I just never thought they'd back out like that.

Now the worst part. The incident really bent the crap out of my front 
driver dogleg. So now I have to bend/bang it back to shape and 
respray it. But it could have been worse. At least no one got hurt.

Oh yeh, I'll have to replace that drum as well. Bummer.
