I would be especially interested in the sandblasting end, gear used, time
and materials taken up, and pics of before and after (during?, watch that
lense!)
I am about to blast my 13 window engine bay (spots) undercarriage, wheels,
wheel wells, etc, and prime as OEM.
Good luck with your project, sounds good!

I have spent the last couple weeks disassembling the 21 window and Tuesday
or
Wednesday the real work will begin. Local cool guy Dave Sweinhagen will be
repairing the rust and body damage from the top down. Repair the skylights,
windshield frames, passenger dogleg thats been bondoed (is that really a
word?) over, section in rear corners rom my 67 kombi, repair a couple
pillars
and a few other things. He will be doing the cutting, welding and grinding
while i follow behind doing the sanding and finishing. Luckily all this work
fell under my budget so maybe just maybe the bus will be on the road in a
few
more weeks.

I just bought a new spray gun. A binks 2001 to use once the body is
finished.
I have a 62 beetle shell out back that I wil be using to kind of practice on
with my dad. He used to paint for a really long time before i was born so
this will be a refresher for him.

I'll take lots of pictures for those who care of the sandblasting, body
work,
the home-made spray booth using a nice negative air unit here from work and
the spraying once it all gets under way.
