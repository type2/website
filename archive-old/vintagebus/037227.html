has any one seen the second issue for VW Custom and Classic.  i haven't found 
it any where.  
if any of you live near a middle of nowhere wal-mart that carries every mag 
imaginable and then some see if you can find it.  
i traveled up to my grandparents (St. Clairsville, OH) on spring break and 
the first was at wal-mart. this wal-mart is in this super shopping area where 
people from all over the valley go.  then i went back up on mothers day and 
forgot to check for it. 
does any one know if a second one came out or not?  
this is the second time the mag has been published.  last time it was 
monthly, now its quarterly.  i honestly think it is better than VWTrends and 
hotVW's. the main problem, to me, is the lack of promotion of the mag.
let me know what you think and if you have seen the second issue.
