&gt;PS 
&gt;I had a fouled plug on the Chirco long block i ran from N. Mex.
&gt; the ring gaps were lined up the piston and pumping oil into the 
&gt;cylinder

oops.

that is

 the ring gaps were lined up on the bottom of the cylinder allowing the
piston to pump oil to the cylinder.
This was evident by the fact that the heat riser gasket had a oil leak.

&gt;could they turn on their own?

the rings, do they ever move?

Here's the weird part, I was waiting to do the valve adjust when i got 
&gt;into Cal. 
&gt;Then when started adjusting to i discovered  a intake rocker 
&gt;completely off the push rod. 
&gt;I was running 60 mph on three cylinders.
&gt;I would smoke on starting and after idling but not all the time until 
&gt;the plug fouled fully
&gt;
&gt;lessons learned; 
&gt;its not a ch**y stupid. Wait for the oil to run down to the sump, then 
&gt;check it.
&gt;The oil was pumped into the cylinder and when our hero checked it at 
&gt;the gas stops the stick showed low. When our zero added oil, this was 
&gt;pumped out the exhaust  or was burned by the then not fouled plug.
&gt;
&gt;Weird baby!

not half as weird as my English
