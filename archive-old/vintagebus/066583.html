Subject: RE: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them
  down?

&gt; Hypothetical 34 month old and 3 month old cry all the time. What
&gt; music would play while on the road, at the camp site or at home
&gt; to cork their little pie holes?



At 4-5 months old, our daughter, Haley (who was colicky and cried an awful
lot until six months of age) could be soothed by only one piece of music -
Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, believe it or not.  When she was 5 months old,
we traveled Europe for a month in a VW camper, and actually had to bring a
Bach tape with us from the U.S. just for that purpose.

Now, at 4 years old, her tastes are a bit more varied, although still a bit
eclectic for a pre-schooler I suppose.  I copied a bunch of stuff onto my
indash MP3 player for her, which keeps her interest for hours.  She seems to
never tire of these songs even if she hears them a million times, knows the
words of most of them, and asks for them as soon as we get on the road.
Many of these are songs that she heard around the house once or twice and
very obviously liked, so they ended up in the &quot;Haley&quot; MP3 file.  They
include:

A bit of Beatles (Yellow Submarine, Octopus' Garden)
Songs from The Sound of Music and the Wizard of Oz (also the ukelele version
of Over the Rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole)
A few Doctor Demento tracks (Billbo Baggins, Fish Heads, Throw it Out The
Window)
A bit of Grateful Dead (Uncle John's Band and Franklin's Tower are her
favorites)
Pretty much anything by Bob Marley
And various traditional folk music (American, British, and Irish)
