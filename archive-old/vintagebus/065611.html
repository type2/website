&gt; For home storage (if you must) I suggest storage in an outside wood
&gt; cabinet with positive ventilation.  Store acids and bases (like drain
&gt; openers) separately in wooden cabinets.  Real acid storage cabinets are
&gt; all wood, with no metal at all.  Even the hinges are wood.  Best bet is to
&gt; minimize the time that you have to keep the nasty stuff around.

I noticed at the home center the really caustic drain cleaners were kept
in a plastic bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.  Could you do this at home??
