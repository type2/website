Subject: Re: [VB] re: battery explosion and clutch cable breaks

Also if the Bowden tube is not correctly seated it will cause a wear spot,
oh say, about a foot and a half from the clutch end!!
The Bowden tube can look alright but still not be seated all the way in!
Just double check that next time

 re: battery explosion and clutch cable breaks


&gt; Hi John,
&gt; Our clutch cables tend to last well over 30,000 miles.  You might want to
&gt; first hand inspect the tubing for holes worn threw.  If no holes then
install a
&gt; new cable and keep track of how long it lasts before replacing the entire
&gt; clutch cable tubing.  If same happens twice then might try to fix it, and
if thrice
&gt; definitely time to do something.  After all it might have been a fluke
that
&gt; this one cable failed so soon and in the spot it did.  The problem with
&gt; replacing sections of the tubing is that where it is welded back together
will
&gt; possibly be a rough area for the cable to wear on and even when installing
a
&gt; complete tube the welding can melt into the tube and cause the same
problem.
