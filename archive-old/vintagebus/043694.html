&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;On the subject of doing non-stock repairs.... has anyone put in/ made to
&gt;&gt;&gt;work a 71 bay turn signal switch in a 66/67?
&gt;
&gt;from Matt:
&gt;&gt; I have no idea if it will fit mechanically.  Per the wiring diagrams,
&gt;&gt; though, you should be able to make it work electrically.
&gt;
&gt;I went and got the 71 switch. There is no way to make the 71 housing fit.

Bummer.  Hey, at least now you have a spare switch for that '71 you always
wanted to buy... :)

&gt;[...] I believe the switch itself will fit in a 66/67 housing, if I had
&gt;one...  However there is one wire short. The 71 has 8, 67 has 9. Missing
&gt;is the solid blue that goes to J5, the hazard switch. 

Yeah.  The '66/67 has two wires coming off one terminal - that solid
blue wire and the black wire with white and green stripes.  The
black/white/green wire brings the pulsing voltage from the 9-prong
box to the turn signal switch and the blue wire sends it over to the
hazard switch to flash the light in it.  There's no reason why you
couldn't just run a replacement blue wire from 'K' on the hazard
switch to '49a' on the 9-prong box if you could figure out a way to
use the guts of the '71 switch.
