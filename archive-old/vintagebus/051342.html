Subject: RE: [VB] Air compressor and water

I have a friend that double-trapped his line, but he had a pretty
extensive network of piping in his shop and they were spaced out quite a
bit. I agree that a trap upstream of the tank would be pretty hard on
the motor. Maybe running them a few feet apart might help? Does your
tank have a spigot at the bottom of it? I used to open that and let the
water come out (stand back) before starting a project or when the
compressor had not run for a while.

Hope that helps...

Subject: [VB] Air compressor and water


Hi all,

While a bit off topic it does relate to my bus in that I need to finish
putting my roof on.  What does every body do to keep the water out of
the tank?  I have a water trap, after the tank before the hose, but am
wondering if should put in another before the tank (or is that too
constricting, making the motor work to hard).  I remember somebody on
the list (Scott Fraser Maybe???) who went to great lengths to make sure
the air coming out of the system had virtually no water.

It should be mentioned that I live in San Diego and it is a generally
moist climate.  Any ideas would be great.

Thanks,
Aaron
