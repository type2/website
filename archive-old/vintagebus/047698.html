&lt;&lt; That's interesting as I've got two others specific for the Volkswagen 
beetle, took them both out myself, and neither one are similar to the type 
I'm looking for the Microbus.  The two I have are configured to perfectly fit 
the dash tab which sticks down below the ashtray and also have the correct 
contour for under the dash, stopping at the correct place for the reserve 
lever.  Both are 6 volt and couldn't have fit anything other than the early, 
pre'67, beetle.  Not certain who the manufacturer was without looking.  These 
were installed by the dealer, or so I've been told by an old VW guru here who 
worked at the dealership in the early 60's, installing radios, accessories, 
etc. &gt;&gt;
Hi Albert,
Yes those are the ones manufactured in USA for VOA that VAG dissapproved of.  
We have a bug and KG (Badly damaged face!) and VOA sales literature for the 
bug one.  Both are molded to fit exactly to the underside of the dash while 
the AC unit you are looking for is not built this way and on top of that 
hangs down on brakets so it even takes up more passenger knee room.
 
&lt;&lt;He also told me they were routinely thrown away during the 70's as part of 
the complete package as it was too hard on the engines as you can imagine.  
This is why I'm looking for just the dash unit.  A bit of rewiring makes for 
a very nice &quot;crotch&quot; cooler just to get some air moving in the lower portion 
of the cab.  Worked out just fine in conjunction with a swamp cooler, sunroof 
and popouts in my '59 euro beetle too bad I can't get a swamp cooler 
configured for my '58 vert as well.  &gt;&gt;
So it sounds like you are just going to wire it up as a fan or swamp cooler 
not as an AC which would be hard on the engine in the original configuration. 
 Have heard that the compressors made today take alot less HP to function, so 
would be less hard on the engine.  You might want to check out the 
possiblities if you are going to run through very hot outside temps and/or 
high humidity in which swamp coolers are almost useless.
You can pick up swamp coolers made in the USA during the 50s and 60s and sold 
by Sears that sat over the hump behind or in front of the front seat in USA 
autos.  In your vert it would easily sit on the rear seat.    Eric&amp;Barb
