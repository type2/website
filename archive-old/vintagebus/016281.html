The bus is a negative-ground system, so you're fine there.  I'll
assume your bus is 12 volt.

It is sometimes hard to get a good ground up under the dash.  The best
points I've found are to use the screws that hold the parcel tray in
place.  Loosen one a ways, thread the wire underneath the washer, then
tighten it all back down.  Make sure you don't get any of the wire
insulation under the washer.  Ideally, you'd rub away the paint under
the washer, as well.  If not, make sure the wire is thoroughly in
contact with screw itself.

A more-correct thing to do is to find the ground point on one of the
switches, put an additional slip-on terminal on it, and then put a
slip-on on the ground from the radio and run it to the new terminal.
That's a little harder to do, due to variance in what pins did what in
different years.  The results are more reliable than the washer trick
above, though.
