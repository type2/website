&gt; I've been wedging on my firewall seal for about a half hour now, and the 
&gt; thing ain't movin!  Greased it up, still nothing.  I've got it about halfway 
&gt; down the channel, and it just stops.  Is there a secret to getting this baby 
&gt; through there without bending the channel to heck?

Is the end of the channel still crimped down as the factory often did to
hold the seal firmly in place?  This can be a problem.

I've also had luck with putting the seal in the channel like a tire o a
rim.  Put one side of the &quot;Tee&quot; in the channel and then push the other
side into the channel with a blunt piece of wood.  Work from one end to
the other.
