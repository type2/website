----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; in the process of tearing down a siezed a SP engine from a recently
&gt; acquired bus i found something unusual: behind the oil pump there was a
&gt; plastic pink and white rabbit head. the face was the size of a nickel and
&gt; the ears were oh, about 3/4&quot; above. is that awesome or what. there was no
&gt; vw part number, nor emblem. not a german part - sez china on the back. in
a
&gt; few weeks i'm going on a long bus trip, it means good luck right, ed
&gt; mcmahon?   - steve

I see this all the time with early SP motors. Not nearly as common with late
DP motors though..
