Subject: Tips on removing petrified window seals?


Hi all,

I am rebuilding the windows/doors of my '59 panel and
am doing the window seals/felt channels first.  The original
seals seem to have transformed in to something halfway
between obsidian and concrete.  When I rebuilt the doors on
my '66 the seal rubber was hard, but not this hard.

In particular, I am in the process of removing the 'window
frame to body seal' that runs around the outside edge of the
window frame.  The process I am using involves breaking it
up in to small pieces using a small screwdriver and a light
hammer and then picking the pieces out or sliding them to
the end of the channel an removing them there.  This is
quite a slow and tedious process.

If anyone has any advice for me that would make this process
go faster and easier I would sure like to hear it.

Many Thanks,

  -Dyer Lytle in Tucson
