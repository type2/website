What is it with this breaking business, I've never broken one and mine
do get used a lot.

Rather than have them overtight (which doesn't seem to make a whole lot
of difference on the leak factor) I used very soft compound body seals
which seal 99.9% ( a few drops in real hard rain ) and &quot;adjusted&quot; the
dashboard brackets to ease the fit. I also filed some material fom the
latch where it contacts the bracket  - you don't notice the filing and
they open and close real nice.
