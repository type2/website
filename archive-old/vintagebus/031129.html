Subject: SC w/CA LIC: W 36 323 - You made the LA Times!

Imagine my surprise this morning reading the LA Times to see a cherried out pre-62
Red Single Cab staring back at me.  I actually thought I was seeing something that
wasn't there.

OCTO made the Times on the front page of section G (Highway 1).

The photo is so good that you can almost read the license plate of the SC parked
next to it.

Does this belong to anyone on the list?

See you at OCTO

Scott
