 FWIW barndoors have one wheel cylinder per wheel, yes just one each front wheel.  The rears are the same as fronts on oval windows and not hard to find.  The fronts are BD only and so are hard to get.  At least you would only need two per bus, not four.

&gt;  Check out http:www.whitepost_dot_com. They do good work on brake cylinders - they
&gt;  press in brass sleeves into existing brake cylinders.  No more rust..

&gt;  I sent them off a request for a quote on having my 61 brake cylinders  sleeved &amp; rebuilt just to get an idea of price.
&gt; They wanted $80.00 per each.
&gt;  
&gt; Anyhow with new german being $30.00 each this isnt such a bargain there...
&gt; but i wonder if this would be a bargain to a barndoor owner... considering
&gt;  they have a hard time even finding cylinders that can be rebuilt.  Better
&gt;  to pay 80X4 than have your brakes go out
