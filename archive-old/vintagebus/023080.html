Subject: Axle Seals
Mime-Version: 1.0


Per the recent thread about good vs crappy axle seals:

I just received some new german seals from Ronnie.   For fun, I &quot;scanned&quot;
all of the different seals, in order to show the differences in quality.
The ones I got from Ronnie are noticeably heavier than the Mexican ones I
had.  I also had a Brazilian one, and another of unknown origin.  If
nothing else, it's interesting to see different companies' &quot;nterpretation&quot;
of the seal.
