I agree, also the leg nearest the cargo door is bent
outward a bit, towards the door. And, very late in '67
they put a release button on the side of the flip
forward part, pull up to release the seatback to
enable it to tilt forward.
ALso, my grab handles on top od the middle seat have
white ends, not black.

PS; My ends are cracked and junky. DOes anyone rpop
these? Or teh grab bar assembly?

&gt; Flip forward on side (Left for RHD and right for
&gt; LHD, unless your in sweden 
&gt; or some other funky country with LH cargo doors and
&gt; LHD bus)
&gt; white grab bar with black ends.
&gt; Diagonal support through leg bottom.
&gt; Holes in tube for clamps.
&gt; Cargo door side secion angles forwards a bit, the
&gt; flipper doesnt flip 
&gt; straight forward but more at an angle to facilitate
&gt; entry to the back seat 
&gt; better.
