&lt;&lt; This is my first time posting to this list, so please excuse what must be
 obvious to a lot of you volks, but I'm new to the &quot;technical&quot; side of VW
 buses, and I am curious. What is a &quot;normal&quot; oil pressure/temperature for a
 single port 1500cc bus engine, I mean just a range? I drove a 1967
 split-window for daily 19 years (no gauges, but very well-maintained) until
 it was (and I &gt;nearly&lt; was) creamed by an idiot running a red light. But now
 that I've semi-fully recovered from my injuries, and found a second 1967
 splittie that wasn't in &quot;too&quot; bad a shape to fix up a bit, this one I've had
 oil pressure and oil temperature gauges put in to go along with its brand
 new engine. Hence, I'd like to get a reference from this list to compare it
 to what the shop told me and what the engine people told me, which of course
 were on two different planets (the info, not the shops). Thanks.

what did they tell you?  just curious.  I once asked a shop why the two 
version of point had such different prices, and was told that (I swear to God 
this is true) the costlier one cost more  &quot; because it was made of Xeron, 
from the planet Xeron.&quot;  I stopped buying stuff there.  anyway, oil temps, ya

according to VW, 
oil pressure, for sae 20 oils..
at idling speed with engine warm min 7.1 psi
at 70C (158F) at 2500 rpm.. min 28.5 psi
this for a 1500 original old style single relief case

my 65 with late (AE dual relief)case tends to be a bit above these marks. I 
am also using thicker oil than 20sae.   My oil sender is new a few months 
ago, think the temp is pretty accurate.    AT about 100C it idles about 10psi 
and does ~ 3-psi at 3K.   Havent had guages for these on a H case motor so I 
dunno. 

oil temp- wamed up is above 65-70C (at least 150F) and  what is too hot?   I 
prefer if it is 100C/210F or below.  235F is Berg's magic number for it's too 
hot.  Say oil degrades when it gets that hot.     My made for ACVW accessory 
style vintage VDO same face as speedo oil temp guage goes up to 120C (about 
250C) evidently anything above that is just off the chart.

tons of stuff make a difference, kind of case, kind of heads, CR is a big 
one, carb, cooling system (dog or in housing cooler), sealage, loadage, rpms 
you drive, etc etc etc.

Hooray for getting back into buses!!!.  generally you can always fall back on 
the lo tech spit test:  if you think your motor is too hot, spit on the case, 
if it sizzles and evaporates instantly, yup, its too hot.
