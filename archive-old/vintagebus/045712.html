Subject: Driver's (door) Wanted
To: &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0
Message-ID: &lt;ba.b734b84.2703eeb8_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Trying to get my 66 straight and painted before the snow flies. I can fix the floor and rockers but the bottom hinge on the driver's door is beyond repair. And they are scarce in the midwest. Does anyone have a decent door for sale?

I'm willing to pay extra so you can just drop it off at a pack and ship joint and run.
