Subject: questions about early 64's  Re: [VB] Where is my VIN and other questions

I was wondering some things. On my early 64 kombi with
the 15&quot; wheels I have a big nut tranny. With 15&quot;
wheels am I supposed to have a big nut tranny? When
did buses come with an optional 1500? Never on a bus
with 15&quot; wheels right? Wouldn't the combination of
taller wheels, optional 1500, and big nut tranny make
it the fastest production bus? I guess I could look
all this up myself, but it is faster and easier to
just ask first. I am asking to see if I need to
replace the tired GEX motor with a nice 40 horse.
 Mike

&gt; &gt; I have a very early '64 model year with 15&quot; rims
&gt; &gt; which I believe to be
&gt; &gt; original, even though one would assume a '64 had
&gt; &gt; 14&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And other early characteristics would be the early
&gt; door handles on your bus, and the early cab heating
&gt; tube.
