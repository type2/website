This matter seems to be getting carried away now.  I am familiar with both 
parties originally involved in this thread (Todd Hill, and PLF) and 
understand their plight.  It is one thing to feel the need to &quot;warn&quot; others 
of potential problem vendors, but this thread seems to be feeding off of 
itself, without real proof of PLF's demise.  I don't doubt that PLF will be 
conducting business once again, but time will tell.  Lets all calm down, 
drink a little egg-nog, and remember what time of year this is.  Man, it's 
like the Y2K bug is attacking the VW community instead of all the PC's like 
it's supposed to.
