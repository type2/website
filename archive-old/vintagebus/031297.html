&gt;     I have a question of what the value of a 1964 21-window deluxe is now
&gt; going for (not Inflated!). It has all its extremities and a second engine
&gt; that came out of a Baja bug. The asking price for this bus is 2k with paper
&gt; work. It is not in running order right now because it has been sitting for
&gt; about 12 years. I know some would say it is worth a dollar and would gladly
&gt; come pick it up for its scrap metal value but I think it would make a good
&gt; project. It has the usual rust spots but nothing I can see that is panel
&gt; replacement material. I know it is not a 23 window but it is a closer step
&gt; for me to getting that ultimate dream bus.
