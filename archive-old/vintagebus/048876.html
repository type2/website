Subject: Cutting up a bus

Hi list-

I have a 66 (I think) deluxe hardtop that was rolled by a PO. 
Looking at the bus now, this was a real tragedy, since the bus was 
essentially original, and as far as I can tell, zero rust.

Does anybody have any advice on which parts are the most important to 
save?  Obviously, I am going to save the nose, but to do that I will 
have to cut through really nice front floors and doglegs.  Seems like 
there are other areas that will have to be sacrificed as well.  Has 
anybody ever disassembled the sheet metal from a bus?  Is this 
possible/feasible?
