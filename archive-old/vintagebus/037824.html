&gt;I was wondering, is it okay to put a fuel filter (one of the mediocre orange ones) BOTH in front of and after the fuel pump.?	Yea or Nay.
&gt;
Nay.  The general list opinion is that they are not designed to be placed after the fuel pump and it is considered a fire hazard.  The filters are designed for pull-thru, not push.  FYI, the fuel filter should not be placed in your engine compartment long-term but in the fuel line that runs next to the tranny.  

For non-Bus owners, some people put an additional filter under the fuel tank up front, check it when you grease the front end.
