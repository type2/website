&gt; end rebuild with new heads, p&amp;c, etc.  How can I tell if this has the
&gt; doghouse coler or the regular upright?
Reach around the left hand side and behind the fan housing.  (enigne off
:)  ) and down low to mid point if you feel a rectangular tin box type
apparatus, then it's a dog house.  If it's just flat, pretty much and no
objects to bump into, it's the other.

&gt; Other needs are a clunking in the front end when going slowly going over
&gt; bumps.  Loud road noise from the front(wheel bearings).  Headlight glass
&gt; and tail light lenses.
Most probably a bad tire and/or a loose/broken shock absorber.
&gt; very little rust under the windows.  No locks work, and a couple window
&gt; latches need help.  Any ideas for fixing the sliding window latch when the
&gt; little nugget that falls in the slot is broken off?
I have posted info about Gabriel Garcia to the list before and his ability
to fix any lock, provide N.O.S Bus keys, cylinders, window locks and a
whole bunch of other stuff.  He just re-keyed my bus, completely, so that
now I only use one key for everything.  He even set me up with an N.O.S
Bus ignition switch (mine was aftermarket junk).
He is at:
Gabriels VW Garage and Lockshop
1725 Long Barn Way
Stockton, CA   95207
209-475-0868

N.O.S. Bus keys are $20 ea. and $5 to get em cut.
$10 per lock cylinder to re-key
Bus N.O.S. ignitions are $25-$50
later
