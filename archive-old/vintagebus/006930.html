Hey all, 

  I recall people saying both good and bad results trying to obtain records
from VW regarding their beloved cars.

  Did people getbetter results when they enclosed the 10DM?  I have a friend
going to Germany and will have him get me some DeutcheMarks for specifically
this purpose.

  Any thoughts?
