&lt;&lt; I wouldn't trust a carters box any farther than I could pick it up
 (unh!) and toss it.  The first one I had, in the '56, was great, but
 the one I got for the '55 is noisy and balky.  A friend of mine put one
 in a '66 bug and it didn't last 5000 miles &gt;&gt;

Who builds them right? A local shop said they would build me one drum to drum 
for $6-$700 range. no core charge. they didn't even want a core. They said 
that they usually last around 100,000 miles. Is this average? They also said 
that they did not replace the ring and pinion because it was time consuming 
and usually not needed. He implied that he would just find one with a good 
R&amp;P. Is this normal? I would like to get one built localy if I go this route 
as I like to support the local scene but would get one anywhere in the north 
west if I new it was going to be good.
