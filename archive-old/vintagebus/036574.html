&gt;  Is our beloved Vintagebus list dying?  There seems to be less and less
&gt;  messages, very few road trip stories and there seems to be little if any
&gt;  good conflicts going on. Very little tech advice and questions seem to be
&gt;  few and far between. Either everyone is to busy or all of our buses are
&gt;  running great. It's sad to see the bay window list out do us  and don't 
even
&gt;  look at the Vanagon list, 200 plus a day.

Hey there if you don't like the menu,  why dont you cook up some posts?

myself , usually a list blabbermouth, I have gotten kinda busy recently.  See 
youse at Vintage Meet July 14th in Seattle.  Maybe that will be a separate 
Post
