Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning headlining

There is also a product in the US called Castrol Super Clean, a
cleaner/degreaser available through auto parts stores.  Used
full-strength on a vinyl headliner, it gets out stains very well. 
However, left on too long it will damage the plastic--about 10-15
seconds is plenty, then scrub and rinse with lots of water and damp
sponges.  Worked like a charm on our Beetle convertible.

&gt; Any ideas on how to clean a pin hole headlining?  A friend has just bought a
&gt; 66 bus and the headlining is still tight, but has yellowish stains in
&gt; places.  We tried cleaning it with CIF but that didn't touch it
&gt; unfortunately.
