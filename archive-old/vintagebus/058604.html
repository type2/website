Subject: One more reason

Need another reason to keep driving the old bus?  They don' t have heater
cores that burst in the middle of rush hour like the one in my 95 VR6 did
this morning.  Have to admit the steam coming out of the vents was a bit
amusing.  

Glad to have the crew cab around to jump into in the morning!  70 miles of
LA traffic does get a bit tiresome in a 40 year old truck, though I'm not
complaing :-)
