Subject: Rear fender openings
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello All,
  The Bus that I am looking at to buy has had the
rear fenders cut out for some larger tires or
something(must be that special MX code). I have
looked at a lot of pic's and in some there seems
to be a little bit of a lip over the tire, on
others it is smooth/flat. I know the 68-70 had a
small lip and in 71 it was flared out more, was
there any lip or flare on the 67? If so is it the
same as a 68+ ? What year did the fender receive
the lip? Where can I get replacement panels for
this new? I would kind of like to replace it with
the flat style, but will just be happy with
something there. Thanks
