Subject: Yet another night of bus work...

Things weren't very productive tonight but I did take a step forwards.  I
pulled the speaker and holder from the 66 and moved it into the the 67.
Next I installed the refurbed 66 clock.  Since I couldn't find the
resistadrop, I used my homemade voltagedrop that I made last year.  It ended
up only putting out 5.3v from 12 but that's good enough for an electric
motor.  After hooking up the clock, I thought I heard the sound of water
dripping in the bus (it was raining) and it turns out in the still of night,
you can hear that little clock ticking away.  That was _AWESOME_ :-)

Next I had a problem with the lights on the fuel guage.  It worked yesterday
but this time I smelled something hot.  I couldn't find the problem so I
hooked up a light switch from the 66.  Same problem - turned out to be that
I forgot to tighten a screw for the ground.  Duh!  The hot smell is coming
from terminal 58 on the light switch - it was a very hot wire (it burnt me.)
The wiring diagram shows that this wire feeds the running lights.  I haven't
bothered to check any of the rear tail lights yet so I may just yoink the
wires off of them to try and eliminate one possible source for the short.
If it still is hot after this, the short is up front somewhere.

That's about it - lotsa delays and back tracking but I did make a little
progress.  Later!
