 recently i have been getting a nice grind if i try and
 shift into reverse (obviously i am stopped when doing
 this). the problem is worse if i shift into reverse
 slowly, if i shift quickly i can ususally get by it
 but if i do it slowly it can be a real pain to get
 into gear
 
 secondly now the lower gears (1st 2nd) also seem to be
 very difficult to get into gear. without nashing of &gt;&gt;
=============
one thing I would check is that the shift linkage set screws are securely in 
place.   Go under there and check.  snug them down, then install safety wire 
through the holes in the bolts, around the shift rod in the direction that 
will pull the bolts slightly to the tightening side, right, to keep them from 
backing off.    Loose bolts cause messed up shifting.  if a bolt falls out 
you wont be able to shift gears, the stick slift will move, and do nothing to 
the trans.  Is your shifting sloppier than it was?

The leaky clutch could also be a possibility, do you have an oil drip coming 
from the center where the trans and engine meet?

how is your gear oil?  axle boots good?  running a tranny low on oil is 
really bad for it.
