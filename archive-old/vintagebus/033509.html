Subject: Guess what I found....
Mime-Version: 1.0

Today, on a tip, I went and visited an old hispanic man who was at a 
building only 2 doors down than me. And guess what.....

He was a mechanic for VWoA in the 60's and 70's when there was dealerships 
here in my town (which are looonnngg gone now). Got sent to Germany for 
training, even got sent to San Antonio to learn how to rebuild the 
transmissions. This &quot;bulding&quot; was the shop that he bought after the last 
dealership closed and he went into business for himself. He retired quite a 
few years back, but still has all his stuff in the building.

Now to the stuff. First thing I notice is that his tool cart is an old 
Hazet one that he ordered from Germany when he worked for VW. Hazet and VW 
tools everywhere. Even a jig for rebuilding trannies was sitting there. 
Parts, parts, parts. He told me &quot;he knows he's got a box of old VW bus 
parts somewhere that he'll dig out....&quot; and says,&quot;now it's not used parts 
though, their still all in the plastic and new&quot;. Amazing. I could have 
bought a bunch of stuff right now, but decided to just talk to him and get 
to know him.

He told me that he really loved working for VW. Says that it was like being 
in the military. The floor of the shop was kept so clean you could eat off 
of it. They used to wear white shirts and blue slacks to work in...and they 
HAD to be and stay clean. All the tools had to be kept spotless and 
organized. When the VW inspectors came over from Germany for an inspection, 
they mechanics would have to stand at attention in front of their tools 
while they were inspected. Interesting stuff. Stories and more stories. It 
was fun to listen.

He told me about when the parts guys used to come over from Germany, for 
some reason they would mark a bunch of the new parts obsolete. Then he and 
other guys were required to destroy the parts and throw them away. He said 
he and another fella would chunk whatever they could into their cars when 
the &quot;officials&quot; weren't looking. Showed me some NOS heads and fenders. 
SOOOO cool.

I don't know what I'll be able to buy or whatever, but will post when I get 
it. Should be fun. I talked to a relative about getting a loan to get 
stuff. We'll see how it goes.

Not bragging...just so excited and had to tell some people who could fully 
appreciate it.
