Well I've been working on the engine for my 66 bus and thanks to all the
replies to my previous post, I've got it clearer in mind what I need to do
to get the engine going again.

I called up the guru tonight and poised some questions to him.  I told him
that I'll be running dual 40IDF's with ratio rockers and a full flow
exhaust.  He then said, &quot;Man you don't wanna run 6 volts with a performance
engine do you?&quot;  It kind of startled me to hear him say this so then all
these questions popped into my head about should I go with 12v or not.  But
you know what?  After I was done talking to him, I went out into the garage
and fumbled around a little bit and I got to thinking that out of all the
questions I've asked the people on the listserves about whether or not to
convert, the nights I've spent laying awake wondering about it, and all the
thinking I've done, I'm gonna stick with my original decision to go with 6
volts.  I'm not going to run a big sound system but I will want to run a
modest 12v system with dual 6v batteries (which I'm still waiting on Ty
Hodges to post the schematic and instructions for as per his March 20th,
1999 post.)  (Hint Hint :-)  I've already ordered the JCW Crane XR700
electronic ignition system that Mr.VW has sworn by for years.  And yes, I
ordered the 6v one so there is no stopping me now.  BTW:  That xr700 is
around $100 but it looks nice and makes a Type 1 engine sing.  You won't
find it listed in any of the recent catalogs from JCW though, the last
catalog they listed it in that I know of was over 2 years ago - they also
have a cheapo electronic one they put in all their catalogs and it's a
blatant POS (cheap price too.)   Mr.VW told me how they company that makes
this POS was tell him on the phone about how to draw a black line on a wheel
to trip the optical sensor.  It wasn't accurate at all.  The xr700 uses a
magnetic trip I guess.
Anyway, when I ordered it, I gave the gal the part number and used my 10%
off catalog and they took it and miracles of miracles, everything is in
stock.

It seems that in the past, no matter what I decide to do concerning any
project, I've always got a handful of people asking me why I don't do this
and don't do that or why in the hell I did this.  I'm pretty much convinced
that when I make a final decision, I'll stick with it and not give up.  So
far, it's worked out great.  I was able to get my 15&quot; bus rims powdercoated
(they look great!) despite several local buddies of mine telling me just to
go with 14&quot; rims (they're easier to get.)  With this in mind, I've decided
with the extra torque that my 1600DP will have when coupled to a 3.88 trans,
I better have a good clutch in it.  The old 6v flywheels had a 180mm clutch
and I think it'd be best if I had a 200mm clutch installed.  I've heard/read
someplace that for about 6 months, VW had produced a 200mm 6v flywheel.  I
need one so where do I get one?  Can anyone help me here?

Also, I tried putting on my ratio rockers (1.25 vw) without shims just to
see how they would fit.  The damn pushrods kept jumping out of the cups on
the rockers with a noticeable POP!  I assume that I need shims to correct
the geometry right?  The pushrods aren't bent (I checked them) but I can't
run an engine with pushrods the leap out of their rocker cups.

Well guys and gals - stand behind me here - I'm keeping the redux boxes and
the 6v system.  It's gonna be a long road of people asking me why I don't
convert to 12v but I must admit, it's gonna be fun having a &quot;souped up&quot;
engine with a 6v generator on it. :-)

Thanks for the help.
