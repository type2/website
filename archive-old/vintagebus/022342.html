This reminds me of a question:  In my recently-acquired '64 SC, the gauge
is still 6 volt, but the truck is now 12 volt.  Do I need to run a
voltage-drop to the gauge, like I do for the wipers?  I *also* ran out of
gas the other morning, *also* on my way to work, but the needle still
showed 1/4 tank...

Of course, *I* got to walk...and I'd left the cell phone in the other
car...and I was already late...  :)

&gt;I haven't driven my 58 SC much lately because the generator needs replacing
&gt;and I haven't gotten to it yet.  But I decided to drive it to work this
&gt;morning.  I hopped in and the first thought in my head was, &quot;do I have
&gt;enough gas?&quot;.  I looked at the mileage and compared it to my &quot;fill-up log&quot;
&gt;and saw I had only gone about 75 miles since the last fill up.  No problem.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So there I was, driving along at about 55 and enjoying the feeling of a
&gt;splitty when the 'ol beast hiccuped a few times.  It came to me in a flash
&gt;of brilliance that my speedo cable broke about 2 months ago and that &quot;DUH!!&quot;
&gt;the odometer hadn't moved since then.  About then the motor died.  But I was
&gt;within coasting distance of a gas station (where I pumped over 15 gallons
&gt;into my retro-fit loaf tank).
&gt;
&gt;Just thought I'd share this little anecdote with ya'll.  Since it's Friday
&gt;and all.
