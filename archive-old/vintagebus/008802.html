it looks like one of the previous owners of my bus was a bondo maniac. Ton
of it. Look at pix on my site. I'm telling you, like half an inch on the
nose, all body seams bondoed and I would not be surprised to see upper vents
covered with bondo as well. That might explain why there are no upper vents.
Shishhhhhh!!!
It's gonna be heck of a job to get this stuff off.

Well, off to work I go.....
