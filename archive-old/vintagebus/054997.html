Subject: RE: VW Jokes

So there was this VW owner who died and went to VW Heaven, the place where TRULY dedicated VW owners go when they die.  When he got there he met St. Peter at the gate.  Old St. Pete had the job of showing him around.  The first place he showed was the bug owner area, where all the deceased type 1 owners stayed. He then showed him the bay window owner section, and then the Vanagon owners area. Lastly he showed the man the Vintage bus owner area.  St. Peter explained to the man that he could choose to stay in any one of these areas because back in life he had owned each model. So the man asked, &quot;You mean I can stay with the bug owners, bay window owners, vanagon owners, or the split bus guys?&quot;  To which St Pete promptly replied, &quot;Shhh! Be quiet, the Vintage Bus owners think they are the ONLY ones here!!&quot;

John &quot;Can you get any lamer than that&quot; Baker
