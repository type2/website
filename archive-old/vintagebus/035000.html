&lt;&lt; Uh. Fins in the exhaust tubes?  Do you mean where the exhaust gases flow?
 I didnt look, but i can tell you for sure that the numerous rusty old german 
boxes that i own have no such fins....nor can i see any reason for fins 
inside the exhaust tubes, they would only clog up with carbon over the years, 
as well as increase backpressure on two cylinders...  &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
All German heater boxes from VW with the 1964 on bigger outlets have fins 
inside of the exhaust tubes where the exhaust gasses flow!  This was done 
apparently in the last of the smaller out let fresh air heater boxes made 
only from DEC1962 to somwhere about NOV63.  Take one of your heater boxes you 
have laying around, and put a flashlight against the side of your head.  Then 
with your eye nearest the flash light peer about three inches inside the rear 
end of the heater exhaust tube.  There you will see the fins inside. 

&lt;&lt;As for running hot without these fins...I'm at a loss to explain this.
Please, fill us in on how the lack of fins inside the exhaust tubes will
cause the engine to run hot...&gt;&gt;
VW found that without these internal fins, not only did the heater system not 
work as well as it could during the winter, but during the summer the exhaust 
gasses did not get cooled down in the heater boxes especially when the 1500 
engine was introduced.  Without cooling the exhaust gasses the added back 
pressure, and higher manifold temps makes the 1600 oil run about 30F higher 
in about 75F outside temps.  Thus the reason that all fresh air heater boxes 
have the double flapper valve system in thier forward upper ends.  When the 
heat is shut off to the interior of the VW the rear flap is opened allowing a 
constant flow of cooling air through the heater boxes, and out that clam 
shell vent on the back of the forward part of the heater boxes.
