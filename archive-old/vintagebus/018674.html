Great site...I wish I could spend more time and money restoring my 1965
double door (both sides, as I learned from your site just now), but
unfortunately have to sell it.

I have had the body thoroughly rehabed and repainted and have run out of
money...

If you know of anyone who would make a good dad or mom for this special
gem please email me or call me at (508) 426-8345.

Thanks for al your hard work on putting your site together.

Bruce.
