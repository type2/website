 Would like to take the 57 on the trip up to the classic this year.  Cant dig 
 up the funds to do the 36 and trans before the classic.  Basically what Id 
 like to do is swap the trans with the later big nut from my 67 kombi.  I 
know 
 it can be done but I have been given conflicting information as to what 
 exactly I will have a problem with.  The main problem that I have been told 
I 
 would be dealing with is the nose cone.  They have stated that a lip on the 
 trans will not fit and that it shoul be ground down a bit.  True?
 ..................
the nose come on a split case trannyis different that a tunnel case tranny.  
Both where it bolts onto the tranny case, and where it attaches to the bus.   
  

What this means in putting a tunnel case tranny in a split case tranny bus is 
that you need to remove the front tranny mount from the TCT and use an 
adaptor plate.  You can buy this from someone, or make one out of a sturdy 
piece of metal by drilling four holes in the right place- evident when you 
look at the SCB, so the mount bolts to the SCB and to the TCT holding the 
nose cone from bouncing up and down, messing up the shift linkage etc. 

You may also find that the bus is very loud.  I recommend using the sandwich 
kind shift coupler with split case tranny buses (mid 59 and earlier), or with 
this set up at you do not have the rubber mount which helps insulate the 
noise and vibrations.   Switching to the sandwich kind of coupler lessens the 
noise.

You do not have to grind or make any permanent modifications.   The rear part 
of the tranny bolts up the same, the RGBoxes bolt up the same, 

now, using a non 36hp motor you will find it tends to bind up at the heater 
boxes.  You have to get the tranny spline centered in the motor,  tip one 
side down and get the heater box forward of the engine compartment lip, then 
the other heater box side
