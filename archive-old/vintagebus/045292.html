   I am gathering parts for a transaxle swap/redux rebuild for my '66
     standard.  Evreyone that I've talked to or seen advertised sells
     rebuilt transaxles without nose cones, axles, and redux boxes.  The
     reason I'm looking for a rebuilt unit is that I believe my fulcrum
     plates are worn and are the reason I'm getting loud metal clanking
     noises every time I accelerate.  I'm also assuming the paddle ends of
     the axles are equally as worn but won't know this until I start
     removing them.  I am not interested in taking on the job of doing the ...

well, often the ends of the axles are worn, they are old and could be much
(ab)used, but usually still servicable.  Amazingly, new fulcrum plates are
available for $10 (takes 4).  Trannies are pretty sturdy.

rear axle shaft  211 501 201 is the same on all splitties.  there was some
slight changes, but they are interchangable.
 though they came in slightly different sizes marked by a paint dot blue pink
or green.  You just need to make sure the fulcrum plate clearance is within
spec and have the tranny builder okay the axle shafts.

  If you get parts out of a split case tranny DO NOT mix and match early
(early 59 and back) and late style fulcrum plates or there will be self
destruction. when you put the rounded side down on a flat surface the late
style have a slight rock to it end to end (.2 mm), the early style does not
at all.

axle shafts are only available used.
