I've broken one of the big leaves in a '62 and earlier front

Can I use a leaf from a '64-'67?

my 70 ed of the parts list (for spliity parts) says:

211 411 033   Torsion spring (nine leaves) from ch#20-117 902         no.-2

which tells us all the post barndoor splitty ones are interchangable.   

As you don't have a barndoor, go ahead and use the ones from the later beam
you may have available.

So, keep those barndoor torsion leaves, folks, if you have them, just in case.
