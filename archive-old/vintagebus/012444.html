&gt; I
&gt;would be interested though in peoples opinions to see if .004 would cause
&gt;problems with the engine with wear and poor performance.

In my various books, they all seem to agree on 0.005&quot;(0.12mm)

 In actuality it should be based on CC's . . 
well . . my actuality  . . :-)

 As I recall 0.020&quot;(0.5mm) is equal to 1 CC  . . ?  (check)
for an 85.5mm bore . . so you're getting the decks to within
.25 CC which is cool . . . add that varialnce to the variance of
the combustion chambers . .

 I think I recall .5 CC is a real good balance job . .
One CC ain't bad . . .  :-)

 You see above where you could put the long stroker in the biggest
chamber and bring this stuff even closer ?

 Not to open any old wounds here but the proof is in the putting.

 As in put put . . when you have balanced all this and put your 
engine back together you get to check how good you did by measuring
compression . . 

 I'd calculate the difference in the readings but it's going to make
them all the same as far as your guage can read . .
