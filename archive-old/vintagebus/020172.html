Subject: re:new engine oil leak
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id WAA12359

was writ:
is it leaking while running or after you shut it off? How big a leak spot on 
the ground while running for five or ten minutes, or five or ten minutes after
being shut off? Eric&amp;Barb

the first time i noticed it was on about the third day of driving...i just was
glancing under the bus...all hapy because i had a leak free bus, but there was
a puddle about the twice the diameter of a CD...i wasn't sure if it was new or
old(it looked new) that night i rode my bike, and did not drive again for a
few days. After the break from driving i looked at it again...puddles about 3
times the diameter of a quarter, i don't see oil spilling out of it while it
runs, it just kind of looks damp in the are under the front engine seal...

on a related note my brand new German oil pressure switch just died to day
too, i popped a new mexican one in, as i was no where near the one from my old
engine...i don't intend to complain abou this engine it seems to be running
really nice, quiet and smooth....i am just wondering about these
things...pressure switches-are the german ones really better? i will hae to
check the make of my old switch-which never failed....
