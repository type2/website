This is being sent to the vintagebus list as there have been recent
inquiries...

The official show is Sunday October 17 -- gates open at 9:00am.  There tends
to be a lot of stuff going on Saturday as people are setting up cars for car
show, parts for parts selling, and so forth.  For those who haven't been,
this isn't really much in the way of &quot;fest&quot; show... there isn't any food or
anything special of note.... but it is an indoor car show and swap meet.
Tends to have big attendance due to being the last show of the season..

For directions to the event... go to http://www.thefair_dot_com/ web site.  If
you are interested in the car show or swap selling, here is the contact
information for the organizers of the event:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Oktobugfest at the Puyallup Fairgrounds in Puyallup from 9:00 am to
4:00 pm. Info: (206) 523-9200 or (425) 771-6411  &lt;&lt;&lt;

Here is Daniel Simmons' instructions on camping Saturday night.  He posted
this to the wetwesties mailing list.

Anyway there is a field on the back side of the fairgrounds..
I think that is the south side... look for the old (white) roller coaster
frame... or if you have been there to exhibit it is on the side where you
would drive in.... it is a big field and is opened for camping with some
hookups available... but the majority is just a parking space.... with luck
I will be rolling in there SATURDAY afternoon after dinner?
ANYWAY hope to see some buses there... last time there were only 3 of us and
a Honda accord....

I am planning on being there Saturday night.  The fairgrounds are pretty
much in the middle of (small) town, so plenty of places to get food or drink
around...
