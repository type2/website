Subject: wong-foo pulleys
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

The weather here in arizona has been cold and wet lately. The bus has been 
running a little strange, ie. needs carb adjusted. So i decided to take the 
day to do some maintenence.

First off I pop the lid open and check to make sure that everything is hooked 
up ok and that nothing came loose. Oh crap! The alternator pulley went to 
crap. Seems the rar piece that rides along the shaft has worked a groove on 
the backsie where it meets the little bearing or whatever it is. So its 
sitting too far back and is making contact with the face of the alternator, 
slowly eating the sucker away. So question, is this common with the crappy 
taiwaneese and brazilianeese pulleys? I keep the belt tightened just right. 
This ever happen with the German pulleys?
