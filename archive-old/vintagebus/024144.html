&gt;  No one answered my question concerning the engine numbers. is a block
&gt;  marked with three O's a factory replacement block?
&gt;  

new cases come with no number on them

factory rebuildt cases either have a replacement tag attached, or have the 
\X/ recycling symbol stamped in.

anything the factory redid gets the \X/ recycling symbol stamped on it- those 
three arrrows in a circle around the \X/, you know.

what size case is it?  dual releif?  which alloy?  those will give you clues 
on the case' age
