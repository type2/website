Subject: Headlight switch repair

Hey,

I am i the process of fixin' my switch, and I am reading over Eric &amp; Barbs'
procedure on Type2_dot_com.  Everything was going smoothly, until I came to the
part about removing the dimmer switch rheostat.  How is this accomplished?
As far as I can tell...this 'insulator' is pretty much part of the switch,
and would require 'breaking' the plastic.

I need to bypass the 'dimmer', as my dash lights like to stay on even with
the swith off.(no grin)

Thanks for any help...
