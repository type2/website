&gt;OK, that is a bit of an over statement!  Ever tried finding a water pump for
&gt;a 65?  Took me 3 years.

You cut off my quote there a bit...what I said was &quot;Westfalia is incredibly
easy as far as research goes&quot; heheh. I know EXACTLY what I need for my 55
Westfalia, but that doesn't meanI can find it. Whereas for my 66 EZ Camper,
I don't even know what I NEED much less where to find it. Heck, at least
you knew which water pump to look for...I'm still trying to figure out what
my original upholstery should look like (and I have a feeling it's ugly as
sin).

But you're right, it probably was a bit of an overstatement. Let's
try...just &quot;easier&quot; :)
