Subject: OCTO pics

These are what little I took of OCTO for anyone interested.

On another note I spent the weekend before last using the Barndoor to
move and it performed awesome! With several hundred pounds of stuff
loaded on one trip I had to make a steep hill and that little 25 horse
engine kicked ass! I am in need however of tie rods and a link pin
adjustment which I will take care of later since I won't be driving the
bus much until it gets dry.
