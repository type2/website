&lt;&lt; Probably for the same reason they call the 55-61 blinky front turn signals

All you have to do to keep my er, bus lubed is fiddle with the turn signals, 
sometimes it takes a while, but its worth it because I don't have to stop and 
think &quot;Was it GL-4 or GL-5 that caused me all those problems last time?&quot;
