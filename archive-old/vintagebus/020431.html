Subject: Death of Da'List from a newbie
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi VW Land  Yes I am a newbie to Da'List and so I read
more than I write.I know very little about that old
bus out there when compaired to this list so I cant
help very many here.How about a side story about
getting people to write...I tried my hand at pulling
all of my real family members together thru emails I
even created a web site to post stories and such that
had family content...out of more than 35 people that
had internet access only 3 or 4 ever sent in more than
a message that had been Forwared a million times over
the net....And I had to shut down the site for lack of
intrest.I know this says volumes about my relatives
but hey I did not pick them.Well anyways if our
numbers are few here compaired to the other lists I
guess that has something to do with why we bought a
Split window in the first place or should I say why
our bus found us? We are fewer than the rest?....We
are different than the rest?...Is this good or bad? I
dont know.But I do know when I see another split
window going the other way...we have something in
common with one another and that is special.And all of
the rest of those cars out there are more or less
unseen to me.We had a local club maybe they are back
together now...I dont know.We would meet at woodstocks
pizza place.Just about the time I bought my bus and
found the club it was ending from lack of
intrest.People were just not showing up.I mean Pizza
and beer or whatever and no shows....WOW!!! House
falling apart? Kids on the warpath? No gas money? Darn
brakes pulling to hard to the left up front and I just
missed that last cement mixer truck by two inches? I
guess we are out here somewhere and now we are
here.Dont feel bad Ronnie...If I may call you that
being a newbie and all that I am.We are out here and
we are with you all...We/me... just dont know enough
yet to help much..speaking for myself that is.You and
Thom and many others are of a great help that is for
sure.How does that old song go?Dont let go.....Well
enough of this...sorry about that.Hey.....How do I get
my wheel to fall off? What is going on out
there....Now I got to check my lug nuts...Man!!! Is
there a piece of that bus I have not massaged yet?
Been inside the carb so I had to buy a new one.....I
LOVE IT !!!!!!!   Mark and his 67 Deluxe Ol'Dollar ?
ahhh....Bob? ahhh...Name that Bus contest?
