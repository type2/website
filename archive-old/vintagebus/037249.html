Just thought everyone would like to see the projects that kept us busy for

The 57 is for a gentleman that owned a 55-56 new, and wanted to experince the 
VW passion again.
The 67 is a original owner bus, who will be writing a book about his life's 
experiences with the bus.
Next up, a 63 23 window and my wifes 58 ghia convert.
