Hi Thomas,
Better yet get two yellow trailer turn signals or a pair of type 1 back up 
lights and paint the insides of the lenses with a yellow paint.  Then hook 
these up to the turn signal/brake light wire of the rear turn signals and 
mount these lights up on the rear of the bus.  The additional signal/brake 
lights really help if one of the stocker lights fails!  Plus folks on the 
road pay much, much more attention to yellow signals and so far through 16 
Westen states with this setup no law enforcement has had any problems with 
this.
  To see the rear of our bus and these lights see:
