&lt;&lt; The drivers side RGB has some play in it.  I can deflect the tire about 
1-2 mm when pulling on the tire  from side to side.  I know that there should 
be no play, but at what  point should I worry.  There are no shavings in the 
oil yet.  Its a bit  noisy but not annoying.  I assume this will just get 
worse, but could it be dangerous to drive with it like it is? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Sounds like it is marginal.  The problem is that if it gets worse then the 
axle seal will start leaking resulting in a dry RGB if you do not continually 
pay attention to it.  Even then it could easily leave you in a lurch.  So 
unless you only drive it a couple of miles away from home and no farther or 
own a towing company, it might be just best to replace the bearings and get 
it over with.

&lt;&lt;This bus is a interior parts donor and as such I've only spent the minimum 
to keep it on the road.  I don't want to put money into it if I don't have to 
.  She's running, turning, and stopping now so I just want to drive her for a 
3rd car back up.&gt;&gt;
  Then it might be best to just sell it to someone who is ready to invest 
some money into it.

&lt;&lt;Question:  Will there be a problem with just torquing the studs below the 
rocker assembly to factory specs. and not doing the upper ones??&gt;&gt;
Normally if the head nuts were all fairly tight we would say it probably 
would be fine to do only the lower head nuts.  More likely if the one nut was 
compleatly loose it just would be better to remove the engine, take it down 
to a long block, and retorque all of the case and then head fasteners.
