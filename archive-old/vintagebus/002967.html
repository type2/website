How about that KA on the m-code plate - I wonder where that is - my 60 has a
port of entry code of KN - I wonder where that is.  It would seem to me that
the points of entry would be say, Vancouver, Halifax, Montreal, St. Johns
etc... but KA or KN - seems kinda odd!

&gt; Hey
&gt;
&gt; That black under-coating stuff looks like the same stuff that was under my
&gt; bus - mine is a 60 - odds are probably pretty good that they came from the
&gt; same VW dealer. So that's the bus you spoke to me about before?  I'm in
&gt; Winnipeg, maybe 2 hours from Brandon.  It doesn't look so bad - if I had a
&gt; place to store it I'd take it off your hands myself.  I would hate to move
&gt; it in a Manitoba winter though, but it has warmed up a bit lately.  So how
&gt; complete is the interior?
&gt;
&gt; I will ask around - a few people I know would like to have a bus.
