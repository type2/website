Once, many moons ago at Busses by the Arch (Vanagons 40 Miles from the
Arch), fellow Bus Butt Brian Herr brought along a short-wave radio setup
that received AM, FM, SW and television audio bands.  That night, Brian
scrambled up a light post with this enormously long wire attached to the
radio.  We spent the evening listening to broadcasts such as Radio Freedom
out of Berlin, and some really whacky Asian broadcasts.   It was pretty
interesting, and somehow fitting for the campout.

Since then I've found a AM/SW radio that's actually switchable between 6 and
12 volts, but I really like the look of the block-off plate in my bus and
haven't figured out a way to mount it that I'm happy with yet.  Plus I
already have a Sony CD player mounted under the parcel tray, so I would also
have to figure out a way to switch the antenna leads between radios.

Let us know how that works!  It sure would be kewl to listen to SW while on
long road trips!

-Brian

&gt; shortwave anymore?  Or is SW something other than shortwave?
