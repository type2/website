Colleagues,

I got My Sweet Bus back on Wednesday, the belly pans intact.  Now I
need to go in and re-POR15 the weld spots and maybe silicon between the
welds, to help keep the water out.  I Por-15'd both sidse, per Kelly's
instructions.

Question.  I bought a set of rear tail lights from Ronnie.  Nice and
nicer price, I am no Reto-Nazi.  I noticed the two wires for the light
match the coloring on the existing lights, but on the new light casing
there is a little screwed on connector that I assume is for a ground. 
Where is the logical place to ground to?

Thanks in advance,

Curt
