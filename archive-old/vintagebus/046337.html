 I have a 64 sundial w/ 1600 sp.  It developed a lag at acceleration.  it has 
 a 30/31 carb and I adjusted the air/fuel 1 turn past highest idle, no help.  
 I replaced the plugs and wires and reset the timing.  any help would be 
 great!
  &gt;&gt;

did you reset the points before you reset the timing?  

your bus did not used to lag, but recently developed a lag?
