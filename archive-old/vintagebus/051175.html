Subject: Re: [VB] Re:Listee stickers

I would support the idea of including a donation to the list fund. My
two cents would say make the sticker a yearly thing, make the donation
(when multiplied by the likely number of takers) to equal what it
costs to keep the type2 server whirring for another year...

Well guys,
I came back to check my e-mail after posting this morning.......I
believe
there is enough interest.

Here is the scoop.....I am finalizing the artwork.  It will be a split
bus
graphic with vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com on it.

They will be cut vinyl stickers.  I'll start of with white and black
and
worry about colors later.

I'm not positive on price ...but don''t expect them to be higher than
a few
bucks.  I will probably tack a dollar on to donate to the list fund
though.

I can mail some out......I will likely accept payment with a SASE and
then
send em out.

Regarding the type2 list....If there is interest I can possibly do a
bay bus
sticker too. We'll check that out.

Soon as i get the pic scanned, I'll post it to the web in a day or so.

I'll keep you guys updated via list and will have some for OCTO.
