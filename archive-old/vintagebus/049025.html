Hey:

You guys remember the nice paint chip color manual that was linked to the Karmann Ghia Registry page years ago that dissappeared?  Well it's back, but at a different URL than before.  Here's the new location:

http://karmannghia_dot_org/paint_chips.html

I always found this to be somewhat useful, at least for general color ideas as well as mixing formulas, etc. or just to find out L code #'s.  The NEATO webpage has color code info as well, so with the two webpages everyone should be covered.

Robert
