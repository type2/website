Subject: pop out restoring and questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,

I just received some popouts for my 66 crewcab.  I
haven't had a chance to test fit them, but I'd like to
know a few things...

Are all popouts from 67 down the same dimensions?  I
know the latches were changed at some point (62/63?),
but I haven't heard if the height x width ever
changed.

Did the popouts get painted?  If they did, were they
the color of the body or something like silver white
(same as the rims and bumpers for my crew)?

When I do go to restore these, what are some pitfalls
to watch out for?

Thanks for the info!

Paul
