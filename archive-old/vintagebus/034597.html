Hi Andrew,
Longer bolts in there are a really good idea!  After having way too many 
stock length bolts strip on 1955-67 bus RGBs when installing, we now drill 
and thread so we can use bolts about 50% longer.  If it is not the plugs 
leaking then you need to dissassemble the RGBs and just weld closed the inner 
ends of the bolt holes that were drilled too far into the RGB bearing/gear 
housing.  This happens to us now and then when drilling them deeper, but we 
fix it immeaditely with our wire feed welder.  This repair can be done with 
the inner half of the RGBs still on the tranny and in the bus.
