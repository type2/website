 I have a plate with the same type of vents. Circular with a rounded tab to grab and aim the air at you, right? Got mine at a Pomona show  a few years ago for about $15. They're rare, but not a factory option and therefore not a Vintage Item. 
I think they're much more practical than ambulance fans because you can aim them at your face and the ambu-fans have an advantage only when you're at a standstill. We all drive our busses, right? (need ambu-fans? get some 12v computer fans from your local nerd and epoxy them inside the vent access panel, quiet and you get air when you're standing still) Nate, got vents?
