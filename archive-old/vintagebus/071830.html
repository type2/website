Subject: Re: [VB] wives - don't tell 'em til it's too late (risky)

Gee, I thought I had it bad.  Over the years, Eric has managed to acquire 18, 
yes EIGHTEEN VW's, plus tons of spare sheet metal, engines, tannies, etc. 
etc.  We have 4 acres and that boy can't hide anything from me!  His only 
saving grace is that I instantly fell in love with the Type 2 face and I will 
kill to protect my bus babies.  The other VW stuff is a totally different 
issue and we have had many of those &quot;discussions&quot;.  4 acres of land simply is 
not enough to hold all his toys and everytime we run the garbage to the dump 
I try to pick up a car part from the yard and sneak it into the truck.  He 
usually finds it at the dump and sneaks it back into the truck when I am not 
looking.  Somehow it works for us.  He leaves my teddy bears alone and for 
the most part, I leave the VW stuff alone.  Just don't anybody try to come 
between me and one of my buses!  

Good luck Don, hope she decides she likes you more than she hates the buses.  
After all, there are worse things than VW's to be addicted to or lust after!!
Eric and Barb
