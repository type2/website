Hi, I am wanting to thin the old herd a bit.  Want to sell the  white 67
walkthrough kombi (as in type 23).  I just fixed some electrics on it, and now
it starts and sounds great.  Haven't driven it  probably in  a year, though
(tags expired).  Has original sapphire radio, some rust (front floor, pass
rocker, drivers rocker is pretty good though), hit something sometime in right
front, but is otherwise straight, is getting new windsheild seals, has 6 pop
outs,  has both bumpers,  your choice of a seat in the back or a homemade
camper kit.  It has the original cut out VW key for the ignition and doors
(might have a separate key for cargo door I think), wheel wells intact, tranny
works great, I even changed the gear oil.   I want $1,850 for the bus.  It's
in  Oly.  great present for the holidays.   This is a kombi as in grey panels
in the cab, no panels in the back which is grey, not painted white, all the
heat comes up front. (heat works and smells clean, but no promise of pop
bottle effect)   I cleaned out the dual circuit master cylinder- it works
fine.

pmail me if you are interested

Clara
