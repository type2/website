Hello Guys and dolls   It seems that everything shipped from the west coast 
to the east cost $20.00. Why is that?  I'll tell you why the A** holes are 
making money on shipping too cause they know they got you by the short ones. 
I hate it even more than most cause I have no choice but to pass the cost on 
to the customer.  Later and have fun see everybody at EB2002  Mark Dearing
