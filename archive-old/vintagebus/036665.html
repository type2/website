Hi All,

Seeing as though it's friday, thought I would indulge in some silliness. For
the last year and a bit I have read the about all the meets that you lucky
Americans are able to attend. We don't get that many down here(like one a
decade!) so I've always read them and gone greenybrown with envy. Well now
it's my turn. This Sunday there is the innaugaral meeting of the
Johannesburg Vintage VW club. There are around 30 pre 67 VW confirmed for a
run to Hatbeespoort damn and then lunch and VW BSing after at the farm of a
prolific and wealthy collector who will probably be elected chairman of the
new club.

Now that must have been a post with a virtually 0% interest level for any
other listees as the only other listee who even lives on the same
continent(fig) can't make it.

Later

Michael
