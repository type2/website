Subject: '59 Kombi 1600cc engine rebuild

I took the engine that came with my bus to work this morning. I cut 
out of work early and went to the local &quot;Euro-Asian motorworks&quot; shop 
in town. They broke my flywheel gland nut loose for me. Cool!

When I got home I was surprised to see my new free standing engine 
from Ronnie waiting for me by the front door. Cool!

So I got the flywheel off, put the engine stand together, and waited 
for my wife to get home. She didn't get home until close to 9:00 pm, 
so I quickly had her help me lift the engine into the stand. I helped 
get the kids ready for bed and then snuck back out to the shop.

I got the engine stripped down to the longblock real quick. 
Man...this free standing engine stand is real nice to have. It's nice 
being able to walk around all sides of it. It got close to 11:00pm 
and the engine looks like a dirty version of the one on the cover of 
the &quot;How to rebuild your VW Engine&quot; book, so I decided to stop for 
tonight.

I'm gonna try to get into it this weekend. So I guess I'll be 
ordering more stuff from Ronnie next week. PLUG....He really does 
provide nice customer service as well as having great prices....END 
OF PLUG.

I can say that there is no way this engine was rebuilt and then sat 
like I was told by the PO. It's just too dirty in there. I think the 
kid I got it from bought a used engine and basically slapped it in 
there. I remember him telling me how excited he was that it worked 
when they started it. Now I know why! So I guess it's good I'm gonna 
go through it.

This is my first engine rebuild. I'm gonna stick to stock and keep it 
simple. I just want one that'll run and stay running. That's fine for 
me. I'm not in any hurry when I drive. That's the nice thing about 
living in the sticks!

I'll keep posted what I find.
