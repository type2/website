&gt; NQ:
&gt; Here's some advice to help your ladyfriend feel more comfortable in your
&gt; bus.
&gt; 1. Take all the engine and drivetrain parts off the passenger seat BEFORE
&gt; you pick her up. A true gentleman would make sure that the junk on her side
&gt; of the floor is at least pushed to the middle side of the front floor.

Sounds good but clearing the front floor may not be required as most buses have
enough holes in the floorboards such that things cannot accumulate.  Although if
this is the case you may want to use a piece of plywood to make sure your lady
friend's feet do not go through the floor boards.
