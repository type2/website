We just did this and got seal number CR 9710 from Kaman bearing for under $5.
This one matches the metric measurements we took off the old bearing.  (we can
get those numbers later if you need them.)  Good luck.

&gt; Does anybody know where to get steering box seals? I took it apart and it is
&gt; simple, but I will need a new output shaft seal after it is powdercoated.
&gt; Isn't there supposed to be a seal between the box halves, mine doesn't have
&gt; one. Should I use curel and call it good? The insides look really nice, but
&gt; I need to improve the look of the outside.
