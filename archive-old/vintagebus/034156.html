  I had a great time at Pomona, met more listys, sold tons of parts, found
some goodies for the deluxe, talked to the usual bus crowd, drooled over
Steves valve tool, as I bought a valve grinder for 75 bucks at the end of
the day along with some NOS 36 hp p/l from the same vendor (the p/l are
gone, sold them to Rich Yost aka 50 barndoor/Pre classic campout for what I
paid for them, Rich is a great guy member VTO, the ultimate bus drivers
club.) Steve want to sell/trade  the tool??? I could use it now.


CLOCK, does anybody have a jpeg of a steering wheel clock?? I was just
offered what I think might be the accessory clock, but I don't know what
they look like? It's thin, wind up, says wesel??? on it, the same diameter
as a bus horn button and looks like it would fit, be cool in the DD and then
I'd know what time it is.

Miles, finally staying home for a weekend or two
3 weekends ago  approx550 miles Bor-a-Rama Phoenix
 2 weekends ago 1250 or so Kelly Park miles
 last weekend  over 800 miles, Pomona, Richs house, crank grinder (he told
me he has some 25/36 hp cranks and rods) and Costco, had to get one of those
canopy cover thingies 150.00, 10X20 with 3 sides, that'll keep at least 1 of
my buses out of the sun! So another 2600 miles on the DD that puts around
24,000 on it in the last 11 months, it's maiden voyage was the classic last
year, only repairs, replaced headlight switch and 1 axle boot, it PAYS to
fix it right the first time, my wife's AST#O is more maintenance then my
bus! Also it does have the new Mexican 1600 in it, haven't used a drop of
oil in 24,000 and it hasn't missed a beat. Just goes to show you don't need
to be afraid to drive your bus, that's all I drive. Heck I might go to
Madera, anybody know when it is?
