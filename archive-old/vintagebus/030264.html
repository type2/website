&gt; I'll bet on a broken clutch fork or dropped throwout bearing retainer
&gt; spring.  These seem to occur on &quot;fresh&quot; clutches for some reason.  I
&gt; always weld up or replace suspect forks and safety wire the retainer
&gt; springs.  This failure seems to illustrate Murphy's law rather well.

Exactimundo.  I pulled the engine last night and one of the arms on the 
fork had bent away from the input shaft about 1&quot; at the end, with the 
release bearing sitting there loose.  The weld at the shaft gave way. 
Not exactly sure why.  There doesn't appear to be any other damage.

The arm looks usable if it were welded back, but I'm going to see if the 
FLAPS has one in stock.  What's the conventional wisdom on this - are 
replacement shafts shoddy?  Would I be better to have the original shaft 
welded up real good-like?  This is a stock vehicle.

I dug around and found some better clips (the kind that are like a 
torsion spring instead of just C shaped) and am going to wire them in 
place when I put it back together.

28 years with VWs -- and probably 6-10 clutch jobs -- and this is the 
first time this has happened to me.  Life keeps on giving! ;-)
