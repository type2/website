&lt;&lt; I am curious. What happens if you cut the divider. Do you lose structural 
integrity? Walkthrough's don't have the divider and that is stock. Is there 
something special about walkthrough's? &gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
Take a second look at a walk thru bus.  There is a wall behind the front 
seats, and on top of that this wall curves around, and forward to diagonal 
downward.  Making a substancial increase in structural strength.  Even the 
flip-seats, and swivel-seats buses seem to have extra reinforcements in the 
body.  Eric&amp;Barb
