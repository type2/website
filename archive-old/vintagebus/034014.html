&gt; Hey all,
&gt;  
&gt;  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  How difficult is it to change a tranny 
&gt;  boot with the engine still in (66 bignut)? 
Not too hard if they are split type.  It took me less than 2 hours to replace 
both last time.
&gt;  just haven't been to a swap meet or ever seen one for sale but have one!  
&gt;  I've heard they've never been supplied by the aftermarket...
I think Izz's has them as well.  Here is the site.
