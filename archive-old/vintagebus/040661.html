Uh, oh...

Looks like I'll be missing out on the great camping facilities (Sac), Short,
quick Lines (Classic), and Inexpensive, wonderful park-like settings (both).

BERG, OCTO, Future Sac alternative, and anything else that doesn't support
the WHole bad VW vibe people....

Does anyone have a more complete Bio on our fair and enlightened promoters?
I want to find out how else I might grace their presence.

&gt;    I think we should do it!  Make a Saturday event!  Then if people still
&gt; want to patronize Sac, they can.
&gt;
&gt;    It can be the Sacramento 'Screw the holes in my bus' daily driver and
&gt; restored transporter meet.
&gt;
&gt;    As much as I like to see VW events happen, I hate to promote people who
&gt; hurt the 'spirit' of the events.

and coming soon to your e-mailbox.................
