Hi Dworkin,
Bus shop manual for 1963-67, volumn 1, section K-3, page 2, shows this 
device!

PS Anyone with a reserve valve switch should switch from normal to reserve 
once every month or two while running then engine for a few minutes to suck 
out the reserve side of the valve clean of old fuel in there.  This prevents 
the build up of jellied fuel and helps to clean out the water in the bottom 
of the tank that otherwise will collect there until one needs reserve fuel.  
When suddenly they find themselfs with a nonrunning VW due to a clogged 
reserve valve switch and/or a bunch of rusty water from this reserve lower 
portion of the gas tank flooding the carberator!  EEE&amp;B
