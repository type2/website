Subject: Re: roof clip swap?
Message-ID: &lt;4fcb9266.24c0a6e3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I saw a (the?) 55 roof clip for sale on the Type2 webpage.  I think what's 
happening here is that one person is selling the 55 roof clip (already cut) 
and the guy with the 66 is thinking &quot;hmmmmm, wonder if I could put that clip 
on my bus?&quot;

Seems the answer is no
