&gt; Nope. unfortunately the guy wanting to put a Chevy motor in the 59 is not
&gt; joking. After I posted the message to the list about this being a Vintage
&gt; mailing list he sent me some hate mail. Also told me how putting a 1600 in a
&gt; 50's bus is just as bad as a Chevy motor.

We have a mechanic at our shop who is going to put a rotary mazda rx7
motor in his old 56 bus. It is a hulking shell, and one I would part and
cut up and haul away the left-overs.  

Do we know that the 59 in question is some kind of show piece that needs
to be saved by ( and I include myself here) by us stock/vintage
hardcores?  If not, what the hell. The buses were cheap to begin with,
and made to be modified. I know of a couple nice f_at_rd engined buses I
would own if the price was right. I wouldn't do it myself, cuz thats not
my thing, but it can be done right. 
I see a lot of the sarcasm coming from the folks in the midwest. I used
to live in Wisconsin, and I remember how scarce old buses are there. 
&quot;Round here  in Oregon there are still enough that a non-perfect example
can be modified without too many bus nazis getting bent outta shape.
Remember, the reason they are so scarce in the rust belt is because of
the salt. You folks already ruined a whole lot more buses than any chevy
mechanic with a wild hair up his ass....with your road salt.  :) I know
folks around here wont sell a nice vintage vehicle eastward, because
they see it as a waste to the eventual deterioration that that region
brings.

But then, the folks in Arizona and Socal ( and even Idaho) complain
about the buses they have gotten from Oregon and Washington, because
compared to these dry spots, Pcaific Northwest buses are also rusty and
not worth restoring...

So I guess my point is, weather it is ruining a restorable and vintage
rig to do something like put chevy power under the decklid, or just
turning a piece of rusty crap into something fun, is very much relative
to your perspective. 

 Lets not be too judgemental.
