Subject: Re: [VB] roof insulation..

&lt;&lt;Even with this type of
styrofoam we are planning to thinly coat the roof and walls with roofing
tar
to prevent any moisture that might get trapped behind these panels from
rusting the roof and/or walls.&gt;&gt;

Why would you use roofing tar for this?? All you are trying to do is to
lock out moisture. Why not just use a good quality enamel paint? You can
brush it on since it will be covered by the headliner or panels.
Personally, I would use two coats. The first coat would be a good zinc
chromate. This can be had for about $20 a gallon. The next coat, I would
probably use Rustoleum. It goes on nice and thick and my experience with
it outside in stromg sunlight has been very good. So it aught to last a
long long time on the inside of your bus. And its a whole lot less messy
than tar. I think it would seal so well, you could glue your sponge
insulation up there with no problem (though I wouldnt recommend it).
