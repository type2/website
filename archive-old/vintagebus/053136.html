Don't see any reason these would not work on 64-67's either.  Any one
else??

&gt; I just received a shipment of Italian bike racks for the Bay Window
Buses.
&gt; 
&gt; These have not been available for many years, but I had them special
ordered 
&gt; and at a great price.

&gt; 
&gt; I've had one of these on my '74 Westy for the past 6 months and love it. 
It 
&gt; clamps to your rear hatch and allows access to the engine compartment. 
You 
&gt; can also open your hatch with the rack installed.  This is a great way to

&gt; carry 2 bikes.  The unique clamps will work with all types of frames.
&gt; 
&gt; We also sell bus tents from $295.00
