&lt;&lt; Sorry to bother you all with such basics. I am mechanically
 inclined,(mentally, as most of have opposable thumbs). I just need to know
 where the brakes are adjusted on a 67 type 2(Singlecab).  I thought it
 should be a slot in the backing plates where a flat driver could lever the
 adjusting gear, but did not find a hole on my rear backing plates.  Where
 and by what method do you adjust the fronts? rears?
  &gt;&gt;
get yourself a copy of John Muir's Idiiot book, and also a copy of the 
Bentley reprint of the 63 ed Transporter Workshop Manual (covers 63-67).   
they are useful.

Jack up wheel, take off hub cap if there, there is a hole in each drum, 
rotate wheel till you find the adjusting stars through the holes.  They are 
next to each other in the rear, and 180 degrees apart in the front.
