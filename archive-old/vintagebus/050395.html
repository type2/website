I am considering rebuilding my 30 PICT-1, which is original to my bus.  It is
currently in a box (my wrench told me this carb was &quot;shot&quot;, and put in another
one that won't idle at all), but seemed to work fine when the bus last ran.  I
want to stay original if possible.  I just completed a check of the Archives
and found some good info, but would like some current views:

Should I bother?
Can anyone recommend the right re-build kit and source?
What problems should I anticipate?
How do I get all the grunge and accumulated crud off?

TIA,
