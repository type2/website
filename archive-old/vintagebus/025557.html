Subject: middle seat question
Message-ID: &lt;376EE8AE.B751F544_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

I have recently acquired a very good condition 1967 middle seat for my
1966 deluxe seven seater.  I had a middle seat from another bus, thanks
Dave Easterwood, that I traded for it.  I was so happy and excited and
hurried home to fit it in when I ran into trouble.  The thing is about 3
inches too short! That is, I can only clamp down one rail and the other
is about 2-3 inches too short lengthwise.   I was under the impression
that the middle seats were the same size at least for 1966 and 1967
deluxe type IIs.  The seat has the original material on it, mesh
platinum/ silver, so I figure it would match up since I have the same
original color scheme.  Well, the difference begins by the holes in the
bottom of the seat.  There are drilled holes in the bottom of the seat
rails which seems funny to me.  I thought that deluxe seats were clamped
down by clamps and kombis had holes so the seat could be held down by
wing nuts.  Any input into this problem?  I figure this is a difficult
subject since not many people have middle seats to compare with.

p.s.-  fixed that leaking oil cooler and not a drop of oil can be
found.  Problem was the seals were hard as a rock and the cooler was
loose.  Thanks again Eric&amp;Barb!
