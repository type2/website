 After checking the float bowl in the carb, no fuel there?
  removed gas line &amp; gas is flowing from it,...so fuel 
  pump is my guess, 
.......................
to check furl pump remove the fuel line into the carb, or from the pump.  if 
gas drips through the pump and comes out the carb end unless gravity pressure 
it is bad.  The bus may run, but not so well as with a good pump.  I dont 
mean the gas in the filter area dripping out, you know, but coming from teh 
tank.

 point it away from the coil, and either turn the engine over by hand or use 
the key for the engine to spin (a friend to help with that while you look is 
nice).  if the gas spurts out of the fuel pump it work.  No gas?  then you 
take the inlet off the fuel pump and see if gas falls out of it(put a pencil 
in it now).  if gas it supplied to the pump and does not go out, it is bad.
          Dunno if the bus died after running, or you are getting it running 
from sitting,  Buses that have been sitting sometimes get grit in the fuel 
lines from the gas tank rust, which means either blowing out or replacing the 
fuel line (replace if of unknown age) and taking the outlet off the tank and 
replacing the filter sock and using the magnet down the fuel filler to 
collect the rust.   
           If a po was trying to get the bus going, it is possible the lines 
are on the pump the wrong way round.

The way I test pumps  off the bus is take a stick and press the thing the 
push rod does and release.    It should work with a 13mm push.  Air should 
blow out one outlet.  this is also how to tell which the outlet is.  

to compare PR size, turn the old and new pushes over and compare the bases.  
If the depth is the same, they take the same rod,  if the depth to the thing 
you push are different, they take differnt rods.    Pack that area with 
grease before installing new pump
------------------------------------------------------------------

question is? the pump I bought from 
 
 the FLAP is different than whats on there. 
 
 not able to take that one apart, the new one has
 screws
 
 around the top.
 
 Will the pump rod I have work for either type of pump?
 
 thanks!
