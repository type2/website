X____________________________________________________X

Let me throw in my 2c worth here...  If the engine is loping because closing
times of the valves are different due to &quot;follower float&quot;, that is, the
springs aren't keeping the follower against the lobe, then the valve springs
are weak.  

You brought up a good point that the springs are 500 pounders pushing on stuff
that weighs ounces.  There are 2 reasons for this.  The first is that we are
dealing with inertia.  I could write equations for all of this, but I'll save
y'all the bordom and tell you that the conclusion reached would be that
inertia plays a very significant part in engine dynamics.  It takes POUNDS to
reverse the action of the pushrod, follower, and valve after it (the valve)
has opened to start closing it again.

The second reason of course is that when the valve closes, it wants to rest
SOLIDLY and with extra poundage against the head seat because it wants to cool
itself.  The head is the only oasis for a valve.

Loping.  Hmmmmmm.  Several reasons for this - one being weak valve springs. 
Correct that mess before proceeding.  Look for vacuum leaks.  

But I'm not wanting to troubleshoot a loping engine, but to mention this bit
of theory.  Lets take a dual port engine.  Big manifold.  Lopy.  Has three
more HP than its single port counterpart.  (1600 only)  Single port.  Smooth
running at idle, or at all speeds for that matter.

Why? Why the loping in a dual port?  Because if a steady vortex of air-gas
isn't formed, eddys occur and a steady mixture doesn't reach the combustion
chamber.  Why does this occur with a dual port at idle?  (Actually a better
example is a 350 with a high-rise, but this isn't a Chevy list..) It occurs
because the dual port cross-section, or the tunnels, are large, and it is
somewhat like trying to blow through a 3&quot; piece of pvc.  There isn't a real
even flow through there.

If you blow through a 1/2 inch piece of pvc, or better yet a soda straw, there
is a substantially strong and DEFINED flow through there.  This means more of
a chance for the fuel and air to stay more homogenious, and also the pressure
(or vacuum) AT THE VALVE will tend to be more steady.

So why in the world would someone want to put dual ports on their engine? 
Because at highway speeds the air has formed that steady vortex in that dual
port manifold.  At these speeds it is like blowing through the 1/2 inch piece
of pvc.  Great!  Better response at highway speeds (or higher engine rpm's) at
the expense of an even idle.  

The single port working at higher engine rpm's works great too - boy, there is
one hell of a steady stream at those rpm's!  Maybe so much that THAT much
steadyness isn't needed.  In fact, those little manifolds actually restrict at
those speeds.   Try blowing through a soda straw.  One hell of a steady
stream, but it takes a lot of &quot;talent&quot; to get a lot of air through there.

Pros and cons -- like everything else there are trade-offs.  Rough idle, but 3
more hp and theoretically better response at high rpms.  There are neighsayers
to that, though.  A totally different list topic.  Also, even though in
300,000 miles on my 71 super I've never had any troubles with those rubber
boots, I'v known others who have.  It is possible, however, to make a dual
port idle like a sewing machine.  Everything has to be right.

The pros of the single ports are many, including better reving, smoother
throughout the entire rpm range, better cold running charactaristics, etc.

Want to know why a fully weighted crankshaft is desirable even though a stock
one is balancable as is?  More dynamics talk, but I'll have to save it for
another day.  The &quot;establishment&quot; is knocking at my door...   &quot;Work, son!&quot;

Again, just my 2c worth!
