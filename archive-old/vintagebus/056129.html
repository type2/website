Rick,
I put a new Mexican engine in my '67 last fall.  It was a good swap...it
bolted right up to my trans.  I have put about 4000 miles on it with nary a
problem.  The last engine (the original) lasted 35 years and if I get the
same service out of this one I will not have to  do an engine again in my
lifetime.  I like that idea.  The power of the new dual port 1600 is very
noticable...especially on hills.
Thomas

I want to re-engine my 64 bus. has anyone out there re-motored with a new
mexican motor as used in the still produced &quot;panorama&quot; bus(70's)? is this a
practical swap how about using the motor and trans as a unit? I'm interested
in knowing the drawbacks(besides cost!).it sure would be nice to have a nice
new factory motor to push us around-cheers-ric bradner
