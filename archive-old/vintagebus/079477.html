i seriously dont think its the fuel pump,as i completely cleaned it out

Hi Josh,
It does not matter for this leaky carb problem if you cleaned out the fuel 
pump, but how high the fuel pump rod goes.  Take off the fuel pump and with 
tranny in nuetral turn engine over by hand till the rod is as high as it will go 
and measure the result.
