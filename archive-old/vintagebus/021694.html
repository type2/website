Subject: split bus find turns out not to be
To: everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com, vwcrazy_at_mindspring_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey all,
Well, in the mad day long drive today in search of 5 early split window 
busses turned out to be for naught.
The drive started out at 6:30 am from home in Concord, Ca and end in 
Janesville and hour outside of Reno in the middle of nowhere. Total of 10 1/2 
hours roundtrip that ended in no busses. 
But, they did end up being 3 bay window busses. They were in said shape of 
dis-repair. No motors, missing most interior and dash assy. Missing wheels, 
brakes, one missing the tranny.
The only score I pulled out was some early deluxe pieces bolted on. Back 
window jail bar assy and a back seat deluxe grab bar. There was two clean 
rear pointed end bumpers and bay window splash pans. I would've grabbed those 
also, but they couldn't fit in the B**mer I drove up. 
It was almost a 500 mile trip, but I got to see some of California's finest 
desert. haha.

Hope everyone else has a good week and finds something better than this.
