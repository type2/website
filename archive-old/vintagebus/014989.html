Subject: My '64 panel's numbers.
Message-ID: &lt;20000131.151903.-439685.2.andrehryn_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

Hi. I'm looking for all the places to find numbers on my '64 panel. At
least I can assume this is a 64 since that's what it says on the title.
M-codes plate is missing from behind the seat and the plate on the
overhead unit only has this number: typ 21(i know it means panel) and:
1276786. I could not find any numbers in the engine compartment and the
number on the title is: 8132105129. Does anybody know what this is and
where possibly I can find the real numbers? Can this be a bus that
someone is missing? Does anybody recognize the numbers? Is there an
M-codes plate for this bus in someone's collection of VW memorabilia?
Someone obviously took it off. 
Or simply should I just stop thinking about these numbers? I will hate it
if I'm driving a bus that was stolen or had a lost title and just assumed
another buses identity.
All help would be appreciated.
