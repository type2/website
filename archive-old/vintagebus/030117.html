Subject: turn sig Q

Any ideas here?  I just hooked up all the electrical in my bus.  (65
deluxe micro that i have been restoring)  I am 100% certain that all the
wires are installed right.  The problem is with the turn signal light in
the speedo.  It is alway's on untill i turn the turn sig's on.  Then it
blinks.  I have checked the voltage at the relay and the lug is alway's
supplying +12v.  Even if the key is off.  That makes the light alway's
on since the dash pod is grounded.  (This is a new 3 prong relay)  I put
in a older relay and the light went off but when the turn signal is
switched on the dash light flashes but not very brightly.

Any ideas here?

Thanks.
Matt

PS.  I plan to start the bus up for the first time today.  Hope that
goes smoothy.
