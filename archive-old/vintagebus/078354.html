&gt;It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic plate
&gt;requirements to see what other states think and/or use as their guideline
&gt;for classic car plates

OK: http://www.oktax.state.ok_dot_us/mvreg.html et seq.

  Classic car plates:
    &quot;Special plates available to qualifying applicants. The listed fees are
    in lieu of annual registration fees.&quot;
    &quot;Antique/Classic Vehicle $13.00&quot;

  YOM plates:
    &quot;Special plates available to any registrant.  Fee is in addition to the
    annual registration fee.&quot;
    &quot;Vintage license plates - Any vehicle over 20 years old may,
    upon approval by the Special Plate Section of the Oklahoma Tax
    Commission, display an expired OK license plate that is also over
    20 years old. Registration renewal is accomplished by means of a
    window decal.&quot;

They don't give any details on the antique/classic plates.  I think
there may be a mileage requirement and maybe an &quot;only to and from
shows/parades&quot; restriction.

I know Texas does YOM plates; if you can come up with a set of two plates
that are legible, and the number is clear, they'll assign it to your car.
A lady I knew in college had '65 Texas plates on her '65 Mustang.  She
got pulled over several times by Kansas cops who were fishing for an
expired-plate ticket and who were generally annoyed when her 30-year-old
plates came up as valid.
