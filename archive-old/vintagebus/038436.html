OK,

Just how expensive are these, how long do they last, and what is the best
place to purchase them?

Todd, I'm also confused by your RPM reference... larger tires, like my 215's
-- actually lower the RPM's -- not increase.

Another consideration:  if I go this route, will these tires hold up at 65 /
70 MPH?  I'm getting a non-stock tranny and I wonder if these Bias Ply's
were designed for a 1600DP pushing a custom tranny...

Here is the prefect solution to all of the tire delemas....buy new
6.40-`15 Bias plys. These can be easily found at Cooker tires...I bought
the Firestones....love 'em  they are a 4 ply rated sidewall (which is
what 3/4 ton buses required according to my Official VW Workshop
manual). That is 4 plys polyester on sidewall and tread.  They are the
correct width and heighth...so you can actually drive 55 without running
4,000 ++ rpm.
