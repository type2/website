The round pin that comes out at you is where you attach the BASE of the
wiper arm (the part you normally attach) screw you're bolt down and the
secondary square/rectangle pin fits inside the wiper base. The one eyed
duck should be pretty self explanitory, it goes where it fits. Hope that
makes sense. g

Hi Glen;

 What I want to know is does the cradle part of the bronze L-shaped
standoff get pressed into the wiper arm?  I know it is difficult to write
without seeing what I'm talking about, I know where the pins go, it is the
alignment of the Bronze L-shaped standoff to the wiper.  The cradle fits
somewhere and I believe it is in the wiper base, but that is where the
spring is and I don't want to ruin that.  Have you seen these hooked up
before? I'm on the east coast and I never get to see any other VW buses
except at Dead-like concerts.  The cradle will not fit in the wiper base
without forcing it in and possible ruining the spring that holds the wiper
against the glass.

Best,
joe
