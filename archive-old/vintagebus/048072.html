&lt;&lt; What I have is about 7 layers of paint that were hand painted to give it a
 logo and name of the company I bought it from.  What would be the best way
 to remove it? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
We haved found that 3M safest paint stripper to remove non-factory paint 
while leaving the factory paint behind.  Then lightly sand the original paint 
for better adhesion.  It is best if you could leave as much of the original 
paint as possible and use it as base for your new paint.  Eric&amp;Barb
