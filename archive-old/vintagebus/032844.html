&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; Interesting. I thought the 200mm were larger od, but I was just 
assuming...
  but you dont think buses ever came with a 200mm 6v flywheel? Thats not what 
 you meant is it? --  &gt;&gt;
 Hi Jack,
 Below is info from our 1960s bus shop manual.
 211 105 271 Flywheel, 109 teeth (6 volt) - Clutch 200mm
     Used from Engine # 6 908 640 to Engine # H 0 140 935,  34bhp, 42-, 44bhp.
 
 211 105 271 C Flywheel, 109 teeth (6 volt) - Clutch 200mm,
     Used from Engine # H 0 140 936 to Engine # H 0 183 372,  44bhp.
 
 So the factory installed 200mm 6 volt flywheels from AUG62 to AUG66!
  &gt;&gt;
my thinking is that the first one is the stepped crank FW, the second the O 
ring FW.

      Has anyone found an M code for 200mm clutch for when the small clutch 
was standard?
