Subject: redux box questions

Hey, I saw your post last month and I've been away for awhile, not knowing 
how to respond or participate in the newsgroup without becoming a subscriber, 
I thought I'd email you directly. I've been through the ringer on the 
reduction boxes over the last few years and I still haven't arrived at a 
comfortable place. 

to make a long story short, backing up a curb (stupid) my spring plate let go 
and my bus fell in the back right side. Upon inspection, it looked like one 
bolt head had snapped off long ago and the other 3 finally didn't want to 
hear it and all snapped off too. I pulled the transaxle out and proceeded to 
drill the bolts out. It took me a couple weeks of drilling several hours a 
night to actually get the bolts out of the RD boxes. Due to inadequate drill 
bits and using destroyed bits, I had widened the holes at the spring plate 
end, and to a degree at the bottom of the holes (inside the RD body, as 
well). The standard bolts (old ones - yikes) wouldn't bite, so I went about 
finding a proper tap, learning a bit about that and picking up some larger 
american (case hardened) steel bolts from a hardware store that would take a 
torque of over 100 pounds. (they have the four vertical lines on the bolt 
head) now I began the extremely arduous task of tapping the holes for the 
bigger bolts which went off okay until on the last hole (the furthest front 
one) on the last turn of the tap, the tap snapped off in the hole. 

Now the next week was spent trying to remove that tap, there is a special 
tool for that with 4 rods that slide up the side of the tap etc, but nothing 
would work. Bits would just shatter. The special tool also broke. Faced with 
eviction from my place, I hastily assembled the transaxle and motor, using 
the three case hardened bolts on the back three hole of the right RD box, 
tightened them to approximately 100 pds, and drove away. Now I revisited the 
tap stuck in the hole problem for the next 3 years, usually waking up in the 
middle of the night, etc. and have continued to drive the thing all over 
potholed riddled new york city streets. Recently I felt that squirrely 
feeling and looked under there to find my three bolts backed out with a 
torque of 20 ft pounds, 10 ft pounds and 0 ft pounds. They tightened right 
back up, but I'm nervous. This is a set of 25 tooth, 36mm, RD boxes (56?-63, 
type II) - now I have a set of 46mm 64-67 boxes in the closet, but the idea 
of switching the axle/RD combinations is daunting, probably because I'm not 
comfortable with how to remove the axle/RD's from that center trans, and 
furthermore, I'm trying to get away from the &quot;avoidance&quot; model in my repairs. 
The other option is to get a new drill index and keep fighting that tap - as I
 have a 1200 round trip coming up. 

My question is, how did your job go? do you have any hints?  Thanks. 

-chris
