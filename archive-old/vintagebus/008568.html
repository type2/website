I would like to suggest that for those who plan on participating, that if
the camera method is too time consuming or you don't want to have to shoot a
whole roll of film for inclusion in the book, that you simply get a copy
made of an existing photo.  You can get quality copies made for cents on the
dollar at a lot of places.  It would help speed things up I'm sure one could
be prepared to run the baton.
