Subject: FS: Interior Panel Set for Crew Cab - Cheap

A customer ordered a complete TMI interior panel kit for his '67 crew cab,
in black, and then cancelled the order after they had already started making
it for him, leaving us stuck with the kit.  So I'd like to offer it to the
first person who responds at a significant discount.  This kit is brand new
and unopened.

Price will be $185.  This is below our wholesale cost.  The kit retails for
around $300 and we usually sell it (heavily discounted) for $240 plus
shipping.  Shipping will be around $25.  It is now completed and in stock,
so it can ship pretty much right away (whereas usually they are made to
order and take several weeks).

P-mail me directly if you want it, as I won't be putting it on the website
at this price, and nobody at the shop will honor this price unless I tell
them to.
