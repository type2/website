Subject: Re: new Coleman portable heater

By the way, the best prices I found online (under $70) were at:

http://shop.store.yahoo_dot_com/csskiequipment/colpowporcat.html

and the Cabela's site.  Many of the vendors report the item not being available, but I don't know if they're accurate.

I placed an order through the &quot;Cool Sports Equipment&quot; site (yahoo store) and the total was just over $70, shipped ground to Tallahassee.  I'll advise any problems.

FWIW, when I camp in my bus where there's electric available, I use an electric resistive heater circa 1950's vintage and have even used an electric blanket.  I'm 
looking forward to having something to knock the AM chill off when I'm outside the grid, though -- and hoping to find more and more ways to get outside the grid....
