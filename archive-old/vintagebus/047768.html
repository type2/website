Subject: Offering my truck FS ..need a bus!(long)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone,
Well, I'm going thru some family problems right now and am going to get away 
for awhile.  i've been browsing for a new projects for sometime now...but I 
need something to get  my mind off of this immediately.
Thoough money is gonna be tight..i am hoping a listee may be in  need of a 
good work truck or driver....what I've got is an excellent running 1993 ford 
f-150 supecab.  Shes high in mileage..but all highway miles and religiously 
maintained.  I know she's not a VW but if someone needs a good truck for work 
or something let me know.  She's not perfect but I would trust her to drive 
cross country any day....no oil burning..leaks ...nada
So  if somene has a bus they need to get rid of or dont have time for....and 
need something to drive let me please p-mail me.  I live in SoCal but will be 
heading back to Texas temporarily to see family.  She's still worth in the 
3.5 to 4K range but any trades or offers will be considered.  I'm just 
looking for a bus that is reliable.....no cares about interior or 
cosmetics.....just a solid foundation to build on and drive as i go....any 
project is considered even if you dont want my truck...it's going up for sale 
anyways.
Hate to ramble on like this but I'll quit now.
Bus stuff:
Anyways...big pat on the back to them Arizona boys for an awesome BBB5 this 
weekend.......met a bunch  of listees...nice meeting NQ and Chuck from 
Reno...hope we all meet again.  VWHoward and Ronnie...always good to see 
them. hell, I even won me a t-shirt in the raffle!  Sucks i missed out on the 
group photo.

Thanks for tolerating this crap,
