First off a great thanks to Kyle and DE DE (Westfailure family) for putting
us up or was that putting up with us, for the night before the Coppestate VW
Show. I kinda of invited all that I knew that were coming to stay the night
and Kyles back yard looked like a mini Jerome/BBB event. 5 buses in the back
yard and a couple out in the street or out front. JP and Micah from New
Mexico, VW Howard and Me (ronnie) from Havasu and Beto from San Diego with
his newly acquired EZ Camper. He was like a KID in a candy store, being this
was the first bus he's owned that wasn't/isn't a rolling resto. 

Now to the show. I was pleasantly surprised this year at the location and
turn-out. I had such a terrible experience 2 years previous that I vowed
never to attend again, boy am I glad I did. The Wolfsburg Registry put on an
excellent show. The area was nice, plenty of room and it FILLED up fast and
this was a huge parking lot (really 2) the car show in one and the swap and
spectator parking in the other. The swap was good with the usual stuff and
not really any good bus finds, but then again there weren't that many BUS
people there. Wait till next year. I now feel that this is a must go to
event, if in the area or you really like Cal Look stuff, and there were some
really fine examples. There were buses, but I know there could have been
more.  One of the highlights was Mike B's newly acquired FLIP SEAT westy,
original owner, COMPLETE down to the hanging light, spare tire table stand,
fold up chair, and the shot glasses among other goodies in the 70,000 mile
camper. Here's to you Mike for a great find.

Ronnie   az  home and tired

ps; Oh ya, on the way down VW Howard and I took a detour looking for
whatever we could find and lo and behold we did. Right there in outer
Phoenix sitting in someone's front yard was a 67 Hardtop Deluxe. We stopped
and looked, interior was stripped, nose had a dent but other wise pretty
complete,glass and pop outs there, straight and very doable. John knocked on
the door and I was in the driveway when a car drove up, it was the bus
owners niece. I asked her if it was for sale and she said yes, her uncles
was in the hospital and said sell it. A deal was struck and now I own a 67
Deluxe, paid VW Howard a finders fee :~) and am going to pick it up next
week. Guess I could have  towed it behind my bus. Anyway there are still
buses out there and this one was right in the middle of a lot of bus people
we all know and they never found it. One cool thing is I did find most of
the parts I needed to complete this bus at the swap meet.
