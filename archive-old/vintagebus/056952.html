Subject: Re: [VB] 8v battery instead of 6v???

This is one of those old backyard hacks.  Fix what's actually
wrong with your existing electrical system, rathern than hacking
it.  What specific problem are you trying to rectify?

&gt; A camaro enthusiest friend of mine has a stock early 60's VW.  He said his 
&gt; mechanic installed a 8 volt battery (interstate) and adjusted his voltage 
&gt; regulator to just over 8v so he would have some extra boost.  I looked at my 
&gt; 36hp's 6v regulator and did not see a way of adjusting voltage.  Anyone know 
&gt; anything of using 8 volt battery and the particulars??  TIA
