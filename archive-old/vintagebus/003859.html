Reminds me of something that happened many years ago , i was probably 13 or
14 years old and a man came by our shop looking for a VW engine. We had 2 we
had just finished rebuilding , he listened to both and picked on the single
port /373a heads and 85.5 cyclinders. Dad asked him what he was installing
it in, mostly to make sure he had the rite parts on it for install, the man
replied an airplane, dad looked at the man kinda sideways and said do what?
He explained he was building a 2 seater airplane power by a Vw engine and
offerd Pop a ride, Dad kinda grinned at him and said , well no offence but
the Germans did enough damage to me in WW2 , i'm not gonna be took out by a
german engine in an airplane that deciedes to suck up a valve, bust the
piston  and grenade the case while i'm in it !!!!!!!!!
Just one of the many color stories i rember from long ago,  hope it amuses
you also ,later
