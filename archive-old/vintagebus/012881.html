Well I have the 54 barndoor so I will be OK (or not OK if I plan on having money left ) at the meet.  I guess I'll bring a moderate amount of film and as much money as I can and just bring the old credit cards and pin numbers as a backup.

actually find there? &gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
It kind of depends on what you have in the way of VWs since if we remember
correctly this meet is only open to pre-1956 VWs?  So later models of parts

are not as much represented there.  So if you have a Barndoor, a Kubel, or
Heb you are going to the right place.   Eric&amp;Barb
