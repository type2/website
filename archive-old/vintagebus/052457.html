Subject: RE: [VB] '67 Bus Rims Out of Round

I have 8 or 9 extra 67 bus 14&quot; rims along with 4 with mounted tires.  I
could part with 4 and make sure they are true before I sent them.

Could anyone tell me if they are date coded??? I would of course want to
make sure I keep the correct rims for my June 22, 1967 tipper but beyond
that, I have no need for that many stock 14&quot; rims.

Well, My '67 21DLX has three rims that are “out of round” to the point that
it affects the ride, even when balanced. Wow, I thought I had every thing
relatively “licked,” on my bus and this pops up. I never saw this one
coming! More parts to locate!  What is the scoop on stock 67 bus rims?
Anyone  repoing them? Any suggestions?? The problem with buying “used” at a
swap meet is that they
could be out of round too.
