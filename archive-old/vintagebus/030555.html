&gt; Hi Bill and Chris,

Hey David,

If you do get them to talk to you guys &quot;on the record&quot; ask them about
their
policy (or more correctly lack of policy) regarding the support of
vintage
products through remanufacture of parts.  Remind them that almost ALL
other
vehicle manufactures support their older products this way.  GM, Ford,
Volvo,
BMW, Dalmier/Chrysler all do!  In fact, here is a quote I just read in
the
publication &quot;Auto Restorer&quot; (great news letter BTW) :

&quot;Owners of older Mercedes Benz cars can now call the company to check on
the
availability and price of replacement parts.  The company announced that

&quot;classic car specialists, armed with a complete set of technical data,&quot;
are on
call between 9 am and 5 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday at a
toll-free
number - 866/MBCLASSIC (622-5277)

As long as the callers have a chassis number or VIN, the company will be
able
to check parts availability and price then provide a phone number for a
dealership that will order the part.  E-mail inquiries, including a
chassis
number or VIN, can be sent to classicparts_at_mbusa_dot_com.

&quot;The future market for classic car services continues to grow,&quot; said
MBUSA
President and CEO Paul Halata.  &quot;IT BEHOOVES US TO ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL
MERCEDES OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE EFFECTIVELY ENCOMPASSES ALL OF OUR
VEHICLES&quot;

VWOA needs this type of attitude!

I think when VWAG or VWOA takes the kind of stance toward ALL of their
customer base like most  other vehicle manufactures do, people might
start to
change their attitude toward the company as a whole.

Just because VWOA supports ONE event does not mean they really are
concerned
with the customer base as a whole.  You guys are just lucky enough to be
&quot;in
their back yard&quot;!!

Steve
