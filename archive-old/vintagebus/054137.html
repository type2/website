Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky carb

Hi Mike,
It could be due to too much fuel pressure from a defective fuel pump or the 
push rod for the fuel pump is set too high.  Also could be due to a bad shut 
off valve or no gasket there in the float chamber of the carb or even a 
cracked or too heavy float.  The upper carb half gasket is a good 
possibility.    Eric&amp;Barb
