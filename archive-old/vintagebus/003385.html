Subject: Cleaning backing plate

Does anyone have an opinion on how to clean the backing plate and the piece
that bolts it to the reduction box on a 66?  I have all this stuff apart,
and I figured I should probably sandblast it and powder coat it before
reassembly.  The &quot;cover plate&quot; for the reduction box (the thing that bolts
the backing plate to the redux box - it has for bolt points) seems like it
can be sandblasted, just not on the inside where the gasket goes.  The
backing plate seems like a straight forward sandblast and powder coat job.
Should I use gasoline and a brass brush?  Any thoughts?  TIA!
