 Anyone evere seen the elusive July 58 through May of 59 crank handle???
  &gt;&gt;
is there such a thing? 

the no bumper kind, ya
the stamped bumper kind, ya

(look in tool section of parts list- hey thyey list the spare tire covers 
here, do you want como green, basalt grey, or grey?)  damn- they have a 
strting handle but list no longer available as the name and no part numebr.  
try older list

58 list says 211 012 301 starting handle.
56 list says 211 012 301 Andrehkurbel

I think the 53 handle would only be in and book with the previous style part 
numbers.

I dont believe it would clear a bumper at all.
did they make different versions of the industrial handle?    
di they make a different one for the 36hp sturdy bumper buses?   I dunno. the 
book says they stopped sending one with the bus as of the bumper change, but 
I have seen 36hp 59 buses with what look like the original apron being crank 
apron.   Did you just have to buy your own handle?   I had an early 60 truck 
which had an apron with a crank hole AND the muffler cut out (factory, not 
hacked in)   did this mean they would fit the crank set up on your bastard 
40hp or even a 40hp motor?   why not?   did that apron come new on the truck? 
 

in   in 1957  in Toronto, Canada  you could buy a 211 012 301 for $ 1.95 and 
a 122 012 312 (the industrial version) for $2.55

a cigaretter lighter (ivory) was$1.75
