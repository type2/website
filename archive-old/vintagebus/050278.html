------------------------------
Rex,
     My name is Steve Stovall,and I live just outside of Lubbock,Tx. I hope
that you can help me out. I have a 1968  bus that I need to sell. This bus
is complete inside and out with very little rust. It also has a Westfalia
camper kit installed from the factory. It is missing the refrigerator, but
everything else is there. Even the child's cot that goes over the front
seats. This is not a popup camper bus. Anyway if you know someone down your
way that might be interested in this bus, please let me know. I am asking
$600 obo Also  if you find someone to buy the '68 I have a 1960 double door
I will give the DD to you. You probably remember seeing the DD at Chris'
house. It has been wrecked on the passenger side and is pretty much just a
shell. Anyway thanks for your time.

 Here is my address and phone #
                Steve Stovall
