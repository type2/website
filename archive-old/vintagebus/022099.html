&gt;I have to agree with Jim.  Check out the pictures of the bus in question
&gt;again (sorry I don't have the address).  If the bus in question were a
&gt;panel, should'nt it have had the upper cargo vents along the sides.  The
&gt;bus that was pictured looked like a kombi to me....no vents evident. 

All panel vans did not have upper cargo vents.  Bench seat models came 
stock with upper cargo vents.  Walk-through models came without upper 
cargo vents.  Bench seat models could be ordered without upper cargo 
vents and there is an m-code for this option.
