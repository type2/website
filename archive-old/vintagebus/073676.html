Subject: POR 15...

I have always used Corrolless from Eastwood co. I have not used POR15
but here are my reasons for choosing Corrolless over the POR. Corrolless
is supposedly used to protect oil rigs built in salt water (sounds good,
don't know if it is true but if so I would love to find the original
source.)  Corrolless is UV stable so you do not have to top coat it. You
can prime over the top of it without any special primers or priming
while still tacky. I did the whole underside of my 57 23 window with it.
I had that bus for 6 yrs and did not see anything come through. One more
advantage is it is almost the same color as Ceiling Wax Red. Corrolless
also cleans up with regular paint thinner and can be sprayed on. It can
come in spray cans but one thing I found is they are prone to plugging.
If you start spraying with one of the cans, I try and finish the can,
because it may never start again. I called Eastwood about this and they
sent me a replacement can no questions asked. I hadn't even asked for
one.

hope this helps,
Craig
