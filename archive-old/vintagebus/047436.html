 62-67 Wheel Wells are the same for all type 2, correct? I hope to get s=
 ome off a 67 bus for the 64 Single Cab, should be no problem fitting correct?
 ============================
 
 I think it is late '62 -'67.  Not sure what the change date is.  My Feb '62 
has the non flared WW's.  Clara and her majic parts book might be able to 
help.

ya they changed in late 62 same time they went from full bench toe 1/3 2/3 
front seat= so late 62 through 67 wheel wells are the same.    The inner 
wheel hump changes sometime between 64 and 66, but that is the uinner frame 
of the well, not the vertical flat piece that gets hacked off
