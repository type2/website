Subject: Crew cab rear seat question

Hi guys-

I am having a problem reassembling the rear seat for my 67 crew.

I took it apart for blasting/powdercoating, and then delivered it to 
the upholstery shop, foolishly forgetting to take pictures beforehand.

Anyway, there is an approximately 4.5 foot long piece of &quot;U&quot; shaped 
sheet metal that (as I recall) slides over one side of either the top 
or bottom portion of the rear seats, outside the upholstery.

Can anybody give me a clue as to whether this goes on the top or 
bottom of the top or bottom part of the rear seat?

Thanks
