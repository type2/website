some friends of mine (okay they are my parents age and I've known them since I
was knee high to a lug bolt)  have a 69 Morris Woody Wagen they have had since
I can remember.    They rented it out to some people who wanted it to film a
commercial and it came back with the suspension all messed up as they had
driven it up and down curbs etc and generally abused it.   It cost the entire
rental fee to fix it.  So if you do rent out your dear old bus, be sure that
in addition to the rental fee they know how to drive it, open doors (non bus
people have trouble with the cargo doors) etc. and agree not to thrash it and
to pay for any repairs needed due to their (ab)use of the vehicle.

Thom,
 
It looks like they liked the picture of the hippy bus and want to use 
it.

&gt;do you have any connections near the tampa bay, florida area?  I am 
looking for a VW bus to rent for a corporate event &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot; 60s 
theme.  Orlando is close, as well.
