Subject: Re: [VB] Dan's dented bus (thanks)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

A special thank you out to everyone who shared their concerns and opinions.  
The insurance company is totalling it and of course I am going to keep it for 
parts.  I decided to find me a 66-67 bus so I would be abe to switch 
everything i needed over and luckily I found a 66 sea blue 21 window located 
in Cali.

As soon as the check comes Ill be hauling the bus home and be on my way.  
Again a special thanks especially out to Jim Ellis, Kyle, Jerry (who just got 
thru with his hip replacement surgery and is doing well,) Clara and of course 
Dave in SD who offered up the 65 shell.

Just goes to show that Bus people are some of the best around.

Dan Howard
