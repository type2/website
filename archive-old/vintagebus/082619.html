Subject: Re: [VB] Rust Prevention Question

John,

I taped up the holes and filled the pipe with metal ready (Picklex=POR
metal ready), left it in there a while, rinsed well (you can reuse the
metal ready. Let it dry well after water rinsing well. Dry dry dry. Then
poured the POR in there half-full, sloshed it around really well, got it
everywhere including all over the shop, then poured the remainder out, and
used it on other areas of the restoration. It cures in 4 hours so you're
set at that point. 20,000 miles of driving and ten years later, no rust
anywhere.
