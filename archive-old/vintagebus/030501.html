&gt; Hi guys-
&gt;
&gt; I am having a problem reassembling the rear seat for my 67 crew.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, there is an approximately 4.5 foot long piece of &quot;U&quot; shaped
&gt; sheet metal that (as I recall) slides over one side of either the top
&gt; or bottom portion of the rear seats, outside the upholstery.
&gt;
&gt; Can anybody give me a clue as to whether this goes on the top or
&gt; bottom of the top or bottom part of the rear seat?
&gt;

It goes on the bottom portion of the back end of the rear seat.  The channel fits
with the U pointing up.  Its function is to provide support for the rear of the
seat to keep it from sagging over the expanse between the two support points on
the ends of the seat.

So that I'm clear.  I'm calling the front end of the seat the portion that would
be closest to your knees while sitting and the back end of the seat, the closest
to your rear end while sitting.

Clear?

Scott
