Well today I kind of fitzenpiddled around on the bus.  I decided to start
doing the 12v conversion so I removed the tail lights and found one bulb
holder broken and neither light had a ground terminal.  I couldn't figure
that one out until later.  Off I went to grab the tail light housings that
Bill May brought me.  Man, I'm glad he brought them.  They have the 3rd
terminal for grounding and so I removed my originals and installed Bill's.
I also installed the new seals and made sure I scrubbed away the fine silt
that had accumulated behind the old seals.  Doing a little wiring, I ran
ground wires to a 3 spade connector which in turn was bolted to the body at
the aircleaner tube mount.  Testing with the meter proved that I had done a
successful job.  Next I decided to go thru the maze of wiring in the rear
and track down where everything went.  Thanks a million zillion to Thom
Fitzpatrick's wiring diagrams I had everything tagged and marked within 30
minutes. I identified the fuel sender wire (brown), the coil wire from the
ignition switch, and thanks to the listees, I removed the regulator and was
able to mark the idiot light wire and the power wire.  I also tracked down
what wires go to the starter for juice.  So when I get ready to hook things
up, I'll know what goes where without having to waste a bunch of time
tracking it down.

Next I moved up front to clean the terminals and replace the bulbs in the
fried egg turnsignal lights.  These, too, also got new seals behind them.
Removing the headlights revealed the little marker bulb on one side has had
it's wires cut.  Thank goodness the passenger side light is still hooked up
so I can trace the wires and see where it goes too.  Exactly what are these
little bulbs supposed to do?  Are they for daytime running lights?

I put the headlights back in because the buckets are going to require some
thorough blasting a cleaning.  The paint is peeling and surface rust has
settled in.  I suppose I could por15 them but would the black paint affect
the lighting?  Maybe if anything it would act like a mirror?  Hmmmm....

Anyways, I moved on and replaced the switch on the steering pod that
controls the dome lights.  When I pulled the cover off of the rear light, it
snapped in half.  Damn!  The front one came off just fine.  After hitting
K-Mart for some super glue to fix the domelight with (they don't carry round
halogens!!!), we went to ALCO - another midwestern discount store chain and
picked up 2 12v halogen headlamps for a &quot;2 headlight system.&quot;  Also, my
efforts in finding a suitable 12v domelight bulb were futile.  I'm going to
try the FLAPS tomorrow as they have a greater selection of bulbs.

That was about as much as I was able to get done.  I'm going to have to pull
the speedo as the little color things have fallen off and it needs new ones.
I haven't decided whether to go stock or replace them with some funky
colors. :-)  Any suggestions for removing the speedo?  I've done it before
on junk buses but I didn't have to remember where the wires went.  Maybe I
need to pull the parcel tray to make it easier?

Oh and yeah - where do I get 12v indicator bulbs for the speedo?  Are they
the same as the bulbs for bug speedos?

This evening I was able to clean up the shop and pull the armrests off of
the old bus interior.  I stripped the chome strips off of the panels and
then broke them all up and chucked them.  I hated to do it bit it was
waterstained and mouse pissed all to hell.  Maybe I'll find someone someday
who needs these little pieces and I can sell them for some fund money for my
bus.

Oh and I almost forgot!  I painted my shiftrods.  Man they look nice in
POR15!  I then installed the little plastic badmitten birdie lookin' things
and put some dinky wiretires on to hold them in place.  I then installed the
rear shift coupler.  Using a sock laden with grease, I ran it thru the shift
rod tube a couple of times to lube it up and then I put the rod in. It slid
in real nice and there is very little slop if any.  I think I'll have a bus
that will shift like a dream when I'm done with it.  Oh and I also installed
the shiftrod bushing up front but haven't installed the the forward part of
the rod yet.

That was about it.  Thanks for reading...
