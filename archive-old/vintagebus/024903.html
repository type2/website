My microbus has a bench front seat but a 2/3 middle seat.  I looked at the
M-codes to see if it said anything about this, but no.  The only clues are the
mount points in the floor.

BTW, i almost wish i had the full middle because finding a 2/3 is prooving to
be a pain.

Oh well

&gt; Is it uncommon to have a walk-through 8-seater?  Were they

&gt; yes, it is uncommon.  I thought I saw an mcode for a walkthrough with full
&gt; width seat (and for a bench seat with 2/3 middle seat) but can't find them.
&gt;
&gt; usually 7 seaters of 9 seaters
