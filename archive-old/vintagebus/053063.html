Subject: 64' conversion camper

Thom, I emailed you the other day and have a couple questions maybe you 
could help me with. I aquired a 1964 bus. It has a conversion camper kit 
that has a emblem sticker that says &quot;Caravelle Camper&quot; on the side closet 
door toward the rear of the van. Do you have any information on this 
company? I've been looking and am unable to find anything with this vintage. 
I am trying to restore this split window conversion. The camper portion is 
fine. It has a poptop and flat tilt out side windows. Three on the 
driverside and two on the passenger. The vin# says it was a panel van 
originally. I've checked with ASI and still think it might be a riveria, but 
not a clue. Any help? Thanks...Dennis...
