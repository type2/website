When grinding on metal and you need a reference to what needs to be
removed, the old standard is Machinists Blue (or similar name).
For the home grown mechanic lacking such fancy stuff, it's basically
a solvent based marking material in a can with a brush.  Apply it
to the area that you think is having a problem, attempt to assemble
the parts.  The area that the parts are scraping will remove some
of the bluing.  Anyone catch the hint on what to use at home?

A permanent felt tip marker does an admirable job.  Paint or anything
that has a thickness will rub off too soon and leave a pile of gunk
behind.  If you are going to do a large area, take a brand new marker
and cut a few slits into the end to mush the end into a brush and
spreads the ink out further.  Using an old marker tends to not leave
enough ink.  Use a dabbing motion or the previously applied ink tends
to get rubbed off.

&gt;     removing the offending metal is a painstaking process that involves a
tiny
&gt; file, and eyeballing the axle splines and drum splines and seeing where
the
&gt; interference is.

I'm attempting this, but it's basically impossible to tell where it is
hanging up. Any suggestions on how to tell what is catching?
