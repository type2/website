well, I decided to tear apart the dead 40hp motor that came with my 59
singlecab.   

 It was a semi dressed long block at this point, no muffler or heater boxes or
generator or gen stand..  So I pull the fan housing and intake off, and
started to work to yank the 1 &amp;2 side head.  Some of the tin screws resisted
the big screwdrivers, and the whole engine was mucky, and my hands were
slipping on the driver handle.  Vise grips worked, and the tin came off.
Noticed that where the gen stand had been  there was a gunk of grease type
stuff.    grease?   hm.   Off with the valve cover, the rocker was held on
with bolts not nuts (?) and off with the 8 15mm head nuts.    None of the
studs came out, a good sign, though the head inside the valve cover was nasty-
must have been way way over due for an oil change.   all the head nuts off,
and the head rocked, but had to whack it with a rubber mallet as it was stuck
on the push rod tubes,    - hm oily mess, ooks like blowby,   Undo the lower
tin screws and pull off the lower tin unde rthe push rod tube place.   Pry off
the lower cylinder tin, and pulled the cylinders, which came off easily.
Undid circlips and knocked the piston pins out- they were a bit hard to  do s
I got out the torch and warmed things up which made it easier.    No major
scoring, no major ridge, no hatch marks left though.   Seems to be a thunk
when I turn the engine round- rods?   well when I push pull # 1 rod I hear a
thunk.   Hm,  undo the pre loosened FW nut and remove the FW.   Repeat
head/P&amp;c pulling on the #3/4 side, and notice when I turn the engine with the
crank pulley the FW end of the crank doesn't turn immediately.  Broken crank?
#3 piston had been marked #3 twice aready- how many miles?  Doesn't look good.
Tear it all apart.   pulled other side head and ps and cs off.   Pulled alll
the push rods and put them end up in the coffe can and twisted the push rod
tubes out of the heads or case whichever they stuck to, and they needed a bit
of persuasion and twisting till they let go.  wierd.    Easy to take the oil
cooler (upright) off at this point, into the box of greasy tin it goes.
Loosen lotsa 13mm nuts and some bolts around the seams of the case and pull
them all out.  Undo 6 17mm nuts and pop all the hardware in an old coffee can.
pull the 10 mm nuts (not cap nuts like they should be) off and the round oil
plate- which had 5 tons of sealant everywhere.  It had a pile of stuff that
looks like grease sitting on it.   The oil strainer came out easier than some.
Heat the crank pulley / crankshaft area and pry/bang the pulley off.  Uncrew
the tin that sets between the crank pulley and the case and remove it, and
undo the 4 10mm nuts for the oil pump and manage to get that out (a bit
tricky), get out a piece off 2x 4 and a hammer and set the case on a few rags
as it will leak it's nasty last drips of grease like oil and on the protruding
pieces by the seam wang the case apart.      And wang it here and turn it and
wang it there- slowly it opens, till I can pull he halfs apart and it  reveals
its secrets.

The crank falls out in 3, count them, three pieces.  Cool.   I have heard of
broken cranks before, but not seen one.   Three pieces.  I am a bit impressed.
I undo the rods, wishing I had done so when they were in the case, and put the
3 piece crank in my hall of shame collection.

Check out the heads- both have cracks around the valve/spark plug areas.
Pull a couple valves out (using my valve dissasemble tool) and they are pretty
bad.    All the valve stem ends where the rockers touched them are worn in-
kinda a dip in the end of the valve, from way too much wear.   This does
happen, and makes adjusting valves a somewhat funkier procedure, as putting a
feeler guage in there measures from the edges of the valve to the rocker
thingy, not from the base of the dip, where the rocker thingy actually will
contact the vlave, making it easy to adjust the valves inaccurately.  Which is
why some people have been know to adjust them by feel on worn motors.   (with
enough valve adjusting you get an idea of what .006&quot; feels like)

The cam followers are also well dished out.- must be machined flat before
reusing- they go in the box of cam followers.

The crank was twice over, by the rod bearings and the main bearings, but the
case standard.    Well, maybe a good case with life in it.


Well that is the story off pulling apart a much abused old 40 hp motor.
