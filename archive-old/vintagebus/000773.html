&lt;&lt; Anyone else have trouble with WCM elephant mirrors snapping off the arms?

Hi Dave,
Yes, that has been a problem for more than ten years with these repros.  If 
it is due to the nut that clamps the mirror to the arm you should be able to 
get a replacement from your supplier.  Whenever getting these mirrors it is 
wise to compleatly dissassemble them and grease all the parts before 
reassembly.  This will cut down on corrosion and allow you to adjust the 
mirrors without having to use gorilla strength which in the end breaks them.
