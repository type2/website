Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Double Cab Bows, AND more . . .

........... 
&gt; SHAMELESS plug for &quot;Tom the Ewte&quot; Buese:
&gt; 
&gt; Eric, et al.  Tom's canvas tops for DC and SC cabs are really nice, to
&gt; as close as original spec as you can get.  Since Tom is an Architect by
&gt; profession, you might want to inquire as to various floorplans. ..........

   5 basic og models- split DC, binz DC, early SC, late SC, bay SC,  Bay DC,
&amp; of course the split level ranch rambler model.
&gt; 
&gt; He's not in it for the moolah, either.  It's nice to be able to drive
&gt; to the VW shows, meets and swaps and be able to write off expenses
&gt; tax-wise. ..........

I may be slow, but I'm not stoopid! I'm not quitting my day job, but I would
be an idiot &amp; a dis-service to the VW vendoring volks if I didn't fairly
price my products for the market &amp; for a return on investment!!!
 
&gt; However, after seeing Tom's
&gt; DC  being towed up I-15 by a Redneck Triple A tow Truck , neither claim
&gt; him as a friend.  (inside joke)
.............

Made it 1400 miles to OCTO &amp; back before my points, condenser &amp; coil fried
themselves on my new engine, probably from having my stereo fused so that
the key had to be on for it to play? (played stereo/i-pod while engine was
off???) Carried spare points, but no coil or condenser.  Live &amp; learn.

Tom Buese-63 DC-forgive Curt for wasting bandwidth on Ewetah stuff-he
doesn't know any better!  grin
