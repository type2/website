I dunno - 'possums are pretty close competition.  I hit one with my 911 one
time.  I was only going about 15mph, and he waddled right out in front of
me.  Rolled him under the pan like a big booger, then he caught back at
the transmission.  Not pretty.

I wacked a deer with a karmann ghia one time, at about 40-50mph, at night.
Demolished the front end of the poor car.  I couldn't find the deer; he
either made it, or I flung him far enough that I couldn't find him.  Had
to drive all the way home with *one* running light, up Icehouse Rd.  You
don't know &quot;dark&quot; until you've tried something like that.

&gt; It's not uncommon to run over two or three at a time even after trying every
&gt; evasive maneuver possible to avoid them. They just seem to have a
&gt; death-wish.
