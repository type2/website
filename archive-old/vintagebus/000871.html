I have to post on this issue.

I've been away for a while and haven't been following the list
as I should.  But one thing is for sure

I am very pleased with Ron and his group at Bus Depot.  I've
bought about $600 from these guys, and will buy more when I
need things they carry.

Some of you know my situation.  It is strange at best and most
of the time it is a monster.  With me on one coast and my bus
on the other, it is very hard to rebuild a bus from shell out.
Most vendors are a little touchy about doing business like this.
But Ron and Bus Depot not only helped me with the quality parts,
but also with delivery to places unknown, and in a timely
manner.

Any one who speaks bad of Ron and his organization, or any of the
other guys out there supplying us with parts had better remember.
There is only a limited supply of parts left.  The repos are getting
worse by the day.  People like Ron and Ronnie in AZ and Todd up in WA
are our only link to keeping our precious metal rolling.

Otherwise, we have to deal with people like Bugformance.

Just my $0.02...


Cecil
