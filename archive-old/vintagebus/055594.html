Hi George,
The tubing from the left side of the muffler that connects to the right side 
of the heat riser tube is positioned inside the muffler so to cause positive 
pressure to flow into it.  The left tube in the muffler on the other hand has 
it's tip positioned just inside the outlet to the tailpipe which causes it a 
negative pressure (Just like a pnumatic vacuum functions!).  Having the 
larger gasket on the right side of the heat riser allows a positive pressure 
in the heat riser.  The left gasket with it's lesser diameter hole allows a 
certain flow of exhaust gases through the heat riser to keep it hot, but once 
the exhaust passes through the lesser diameter gasket the exhaust gas 
expands, cools and tends to deposit carbon/fuel in the tube in the left side 
of the muffler.  Since the muffler is replace far more often then the intake 
manifold the deposits most likely are not going to have time to cause 
problems.
