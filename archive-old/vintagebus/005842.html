CONGRATULATIONS Pete !! I know you've worked hard on your
bus and spent some major cash !!!! Now you get to enjoy it !!!
You must be very proud of your accomplishments.

    I've been attending the Rockford show for the last 12 years.
However due to some prior commitments I will be forced to miss this years
show.:-(
But I will camp with the guys the night before !

    The DBG will be camping Saturday at a members farm outside of Rockford
if you are interested, Pete !!!
Call me if you can make it .I really would love to see your bus, us panel
guys have to stick together.

   FYI.   The Hoosier Volks club are having a campout at the 49er drive in
again this year and a show to follow the next day!(July 29th and 30th)
This a really fun outing if anyone is interested email for info.We fill up
half the drive in with air-colled Vws. and watch a few movies and the owners
let us camp right in the drive in.
They give us free coffee and donuts the next morning. A good family event.
