&gt;one thing to keep in mind - the VW is a &gt;compromise&lt; between many demands...
cruise 60kph for
&gt; 8 hours, not have a radiator to boil or freeze, carry 4 fully-loaded
wehrmacht members -er,
&gt; deutsche pikinikers...   :) i'm willing to bet that the front tin also
PREVENTS too MUCH air from getting
&gt; in in colder climes, causing reduced temps/efficiency. as you up ccs and
carb size, yes, the AF/H is
&gt; gonna  have to go up. but unless you live in AZ, i would leave the tin on
and think of some other
&gt; way to increase air to the fan. 'course, you could simply do  a seasonal
pull - spring, metalmesh tin
&gt; goes in; fall, the standard tin.

That's what the thermostat and flaps are for.
