Thom's site says this bus was built in October of 1957 for the 1957 =
model year and that a &quot;correction&quot; in the database was suggested.  While =
doing bodywork, the stampings on the panels are dated august 56.  There =
is no M code plate which I believe was used in '58.  I guess my other =
question here is, what year did VW start using the &quot;model year&quot; as =
opposed to a january-january year? Could this bus have been a =
special-order model '57 which took a bit longer to produce hence the '58 =
registration?=20

  I believe Thom's site gives you month by month the production of each =
serial #.  That is where I found out that my bus was made in Feb of 56 =
and was one of the last Wolfsberg busses.  Check it out at =
Vintagebus_dot_com.

  Good luck,
