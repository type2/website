New guy at work and he used to live in Germany for 40 years,  at the
Hieldelberg plant.  Printing presses for the non printers of the list. 
He told me a story of the 49 split bug he rolled down the cliff at age 12
for lack of power.  What a character.  So I saw a 23? window the other
day driving up to the mountains in San Diego  and  got the phone number
of the owner  and  he wanted no less than 10,000 $ for it......  My God
is that what these are worth?   jon 65 Sundial...
