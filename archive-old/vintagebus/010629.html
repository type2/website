I know how you feel.  I got hit in the 61about 4 years ago,  by someone who 
decided to pass when I was turning left into my driveway.  It kinda messed up 
my back, and the bus.  I now have this strange fear of people passing, as 
that was the second time I was almost killing by someone making a bad 
decision about passing on a 2 lane country road. The bus was considered 
totalled, and I did collect some insurance on it, but I was so disheartened 
about it being hit I could not deal, it sat in the carport for about 2 years, 
 I found a 65 westy sitting, and made that into a driver.   

That side that had been hit was so completely straight before that accident.  
I have pictures.  most of the impact on my 61 got taken by the front beam, 
other wise I dont know if you can salvage a bus that was T boned at 50-60mph. 
  But considering the impact, it is not too bad, swapped a door over.  These 
buses really are fairly hurky.  Hey, it's a one- ton. you can always use a 
come-a-long and a tree.  I did that a bit, drilled a couple holes through the 
dog leg and put a piece of metal behind to spread the pull.  

But just give it some time.   At least you are okay, that's the main thing.

 I got to look at the extent of the damage today.  I just couldnt bare to the 
 last 2 days.  I kept myself locked in my room in bed.
 
 All the pillars on that side all the way to the roof are pushed in about 3 
 inches and buckled at the roof.  The beltline was basically pushed in and 
 ground down, the rain gutter is gone, the roof in screwed up a bit near the 
 drivers door.  The door doesnt open, the rear hatch wont move more than a 
few 
 inches because the rain gutter in the back is pushed down hitting the top of 
 the hatch.  The decklid opens but a litte tight.  That whole side is just 
 pushed over.  
 
 The pillar behind the drivers door window is pushed way in.  It looks a lot 
 better in the pictures than it really is.
 
 The bus had its rear passenger corner taken out at one time and it was 
fixed. 
  I was just getting ready to replace the dented nose and dogleg on the 
 passenger side and a few other pieces.  I just dont think it would really be 
 worth it in my mind to spend all the dough.  I love the bus to death, its my 
 first bus and first car.  I would love if someone on the list here in town 
 could check it out and give me their opinion in person.
 
 Well im off to try and get the 57 running.  God it hurts looking at the 67. 
 Maybe I could drive it mangled and all to Prescott, just write &quot;Another 
 Product of A Drunk Driver&quot; on the sides.  Maybe not.
