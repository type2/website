&gt; im about to buy a new set of rims and tire for the 66 deluxe walkthrough bus

&gt; for $50 :)) in it and it really moves so i really need to improve the

If handling is a problem, start at the beginning, not the end.  tires will
not help your handling if there are other factors involved.  In fact, you
may well destroy your new 3-400$ set of tires in a few thousand miles.


Go over your front end (with Bentley in hand!), check for play in your
kingpins, adjust and check your linkpins, check for play in the tie rod
ends, as well as the ends of the drag link.   After all of that is firmed
up, you may need to adjust your steering box. (proceedure is described in
the bentley)  Also repack and adjust your front wheelbearings!

Now get it professionally aligned to the specs you will provide from the
Bentley manual.  Or teach yourself how to do it, and get it doublechecked
on a laser rack.  (I was dead on spec with nothing but a tape measure and
a lot of time.)

You may be damn surprised how much better you bus drives with a good (and
safe!) frontend.

Now get a new set of oil filled shocks (gas shocks, imo, are to stiff. but
if you never ride off smooth pavement they might be what you want..).

Good.  Now your bus has a solid front end, and good dampening.


Now for tires.

&gt; , i read on the type 2 library website that 15s were recommended, but with a
&gt; 185 tire, but it doesnt say the width of the rim, my wheel wells in the rear

Not having the exact reference to refer to, I cannot say for sure, but i
would assume they were talking about stock-width rims.

If i recall though, from a few detail-oriented early bus folk, a 205/75R15
is about as close as you can get to the &quot;correct&quot; size tire for the 15
inch rims, for busses that were so equiped.  I'm probably wrong and will
be corrected.:)


&gt; have 3 questions, ( 1)is the 15 /5.5 the best option (2) does the 185 fit a
&gt; 5.5 in rim (3) does a 15 rim change the height of the bus or effect the
&gt; speedometer ? i appreciate the help!     One more thing , i just scored a 66


1) this is a question that everyone has an opinion too.  If you take
everything into account in you decision, then good.  If not, NO.  Stick
with the stock wheel.  it has the correct offset, width, and height, (not
to mention look, but we wont go there) for your bus.  with a 185R14 (load
C or D) tire (&quot;correct&quot; but with less options. most of these that are
available are highway rib tires), or a 195/75R14 C or D tire you will not
need to worry about extra stress on your steering box, wheel bearings,
king and link pins, etc.  Your speedomentor will be reasonably accurate
(provided it is to begin with) and your gearing will not be affected.

Changing to a larger/smaller/wider/skinnier tire and or wheel will most
certianly effect these mentioned items.  If is up to you to judge whether
or not you feel comfortable with any potiential damage that may be done.
(or not, as may be the case)

2) Probably.  depending on the aspect ration, of course. consult the
manufacturer of the tire to see if they recommend it being mounted on your
choice of rim.  Some tires (of the same size) will work fine on one width
of rim, but others brands/types of the same size will not work on the same
rim. a 185 tire, if i recall, has a crosssection of around 6 inches (no
conversion formula on hand), so 5.5 at the bead does not sound
unreasonable.

3) Yes yes, but possibly no no.  If your new wheel/tire combo has the same
diameter (i have a refernce written here for .00126 miles, but i'm not
sure what that was for...probably either a 185R14 or a 195/75R14, and
probably a number i pulled from George Lyle..) as the &quot;stock&quot; wheel/tire
combo then no, your speedo or ride height will not be signicantly
affected.   If the tire is taller, your speedo will read low and your
overall finaldrive ratio in your transmision will be higher (higher
speed, lower numbers..).  And obviously your bus will sit higher as well.


spend a few days searching the archives about tires and wheels, there has
bee much discussion over the past many years.

Now, the obligitory remark:  The tires you need for your bus (in whatever
size) need to be able to support the weight of your vehicle, the loads you
add, as well as any inertial forces during cornering/wind.

With a stock-size tire a Load C or D tire is required.  the load rating
(which any tire shop worth their rubber will be familar with) basically
says that the sidewalls and tread on the tire is strong enough to carry
however much wieght.  (just like speed ratings show at what point your
tire might fail due to spinning to fast!)


All the specs that the Bentley has have been posted to the lists many
times, but your best bet is to get your own copy. 70-80 dollars well
spent.


good luck.
