&gt; The early part of 1960s Westies had
&gt; this Euro socket in the right rear closet above the door with a chromy flip
&gt; cover for plugging in the Westie hanging lamp.

An EXTREMELY original SO-34 flip seat I saw at Kelly Park and again on Saturday
at Solvang had two sockets one on each side rear cabinet.  One had the hanging
light and the other had a 12V fan.  This white over red camper had everything.
Tent, privy and pot, all accessories and even a very cool (owner made) tent pole
holder that mounted under the bus length wise between the two right side
wheels.  Great bus.
