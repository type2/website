&gt;The front tent bracket on my 61 westy is broken.

&gt;find a way to mount an old sundial tent that came out of my old 65 to my
&gt;westy until I find a tent.

I think that pic is of the REAR bracket used on the westfalia &quot;privy&quot; and &quot;foyer&quot; tents.  Foyer tent used same bracket for the front, but the front one for a privy tent is 
different.  See http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/splits.html and be sure to look for the Erection Instructions.

FWIW I have used two rear brackets to mount a privy tent to a 68 westy with no problems.

Sundial tent brackets look like the ones at http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/misc.html, AFAIK.  I gave mine to Ellis.  I also have a pair of damaged-but-usable 
brackets that came off an EZ-Camper-like vehicle.  They're like the front privy bracket but taller, with a bigger hole.  The donor vehicle had them mounted in 
approximately the foyer tent bracket location, ie, about even with the front/rear edges of the side cargo door opening, and 10: above the gutter.

I used heavy L shaped pieces of steel with proper sized holes for the tent pole doglegs, bolted to the rear of the fiberglass roof rack (!) to mount my foyer tent to the rear 
of a 68 westy.  In other words, &quot;finding a way&quot; isn't that big a deal -- it's whether you want to drill holes in the roof for your homebrew brackets.

(Please, no flames about putting splitty tents on a loaf :)

Good hunting!
