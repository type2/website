Subject: and the saga continues...

well, I replaced my idle cut off valve with a working 12V one today and
reconnected the wires.....no difference. at all.
I'm beginning to think its electrical as the motor will just quit on its
own.  I'm out to check the plugs in a minute...
any ideas for electrical problems?
the motor won't rev unless I floor it and it pops and crackles the whole
way and is horribly inconsistent.
later
