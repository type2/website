Question about paint colors to Thom, bus related so I thought I should post
it.

Thom on you site in the Westfalia Camper restoration story you have a
beautiful bus pictured with a tent off the side, and some people, near a lake
I think.

Anyway I was wondering about the paint colors of the bus in the picture...
are those original VW combination, and what are those colors. I am thinking of
painting my bus similar colors.

Thanks
