Subject: Randar wheels???

has anyone bought these new repro's of the Empi Raders? i love them and they 
look great, but i just cant imagine why they are a grand. i wanted them for 
my birthday, but the wife will laugh when she sees how much they are. some 
forged wheels are less expensive.

anyone have any pictures on their splits?

thanks,
