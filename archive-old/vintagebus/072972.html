Subject: Tyr the local guy....was EMPI

Andrew, are the Empi items that much cheaper than
having a muffler made up by an exhaust specialist?
Or are you talking the entire exhaust system?
My brother had to replace his muffler on his Beetle
and went straight to an exhaust specialist.
He got the item he wanted (i.e. exhaust note &amp; volume
level) and found it quite reasonable.
To be honest, unless you wanted the standard
item(which I presume could be supplied by some of the
retailers who are actually part of this list) I can't
see why getting something &quot;custom&quot; made would be that
hard.
Did you consider doing this?
After all, at the end of the day companies like Empi 
were specialists in one field or another that found
their business was making most of it's money out of VW
parts &amp; so changed to that niche market.
As I frequently am faced with having to pay exorbitant
prices for products by companies like Engle, Empi,
Flat 4, Scat &amp; the like because they're imports here I
look at the local product, be that Australian or just
folks here in my home town, &amp; give them the benefit of
the doubt.
Most of the time the local product delivers &amp; with the
amount people seem to whinge about some of the above
companies I think the local success rate is as good if
not better.
Some brands are worth following but by &amp; large if the
workmanship is good does it really have to have a
pretty sticker on it?
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
