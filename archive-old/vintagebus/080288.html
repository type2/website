Subject: Re: [VB] Bus AC option

Hi Busbarn,
We do not think you are being a softy, having camped in 100F weather in 
bakersfield CA.  It is not going to be just another battery, but at least six or 
possibly eight just to keep it running and in stop go traffic you might need 
more!  Plus you would have this huge amount of sulfuric acid and alot more 
electrical connections to keep perfect!
  Now if you want AC while driving and when camping at a full hook up camping 
spot, we would figure how to quickly change a belt or some type of rachet 
pulley system.  So you can have a 110 volt AC motor in the engine compartment you 
can plug in to drive the automotive compressor.
