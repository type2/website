Subject: [VB] 68 Puck...  plus

Jim writ:
&quot;'68 Eriba Puck $4500. see VWPlanet ad&quot; 

Is it me or is VWPlanet impossible to navigate and the search does not work.
Too fancy for its own good...  I have no idea who runs this site, so please
take it as constructive criticism.  Is there a detailed explanation on how
to view information about the Puck...  For the simple minded people like
myself :)


Also has anyone built/restored one of those teardrop trailers for towing
behind a VW bus?  It seems that if a VW bus can tow a Puck it can handle a
teardrop.  Any good links or stories would be appreciated. 

If I build/get a Puck or teardrop I would definitely put on front disc
brakes and switch to type4 2.0 power.  

Also this is a super stretch, but has anyone seen a VW bus pulling a
Airstream Bambi 16-17' trailer?   They are light for what they are, but
probably too much for a VW at about 2300 pounds..?


Thanks,
