Subject: Re: Low Busses

.......it's all about bad taste and a lack of finesse.(I want to vomit every
time I see a VW (or ANY vehicle for that matter) (pick one, or all)with a
gaudy paint job,smoked glass, neons in the wheel wells,and those goddamn WAY
oversize chrome wheels.)We as a society look for the biggest bang for the buck
while discounting the importance of the arts in education,and exploring the
inner self.The end result is all too obvious to readers of this forum.......
       it's unfortunate that this malady has to manifest itself upon a
dwindling number of vehicles that represent a lost art in terms of design,and
engineering...........Sorry to say,but We are what we are............
