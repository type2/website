Some of us are current Fire Fighters who just lost 350 brothers.
Others of us are former military who will undoubtedly lose close friends in
the months to come.
I'm both.

Don't mistake concern for stupidity.

Directed at no person in particular but if you haven't figure out that
messages with &quot;RATBASTARDS&quot; or &quot;Bad manners&quot; in the subject heading is going
to be about the terrorist attacks you might not want to be calling others
ignorant.  Also, if you haven't figured out how to use the delete key when
you see those messages you definitely shouldn't be calling others ignorant.

Yes, this is a bus list.  And messages, for the most part, should be about
busses.  But in a time of crisis (terrorist attacks qualify in my book) a
little easing of the rules is appropriate.  Dealing with terrorist attacks
in the homeland is something new for Americans...and the list is
predominately made up of US citizens.  We all deal with it in our own way.
Please be patient while your friends work through it.

Thanks for the tolerance Thom.
