&gt; &gt; We're all sticking
&gt; &gt; engines in these engine bays with doghouse cooling systems and larger
&gt; &gt; displacements increasing the CFM requirements of the motors, but we just
&gt; &gt; aren't increasing the ability of the air being able to get INTO the engine
&gt; &gt; bay.


This applies to the splitties, but there was no change in vents on
the bays when the doghouse was introduced in '71.  The vents did change
in '72, but whether they had greater capacity remains to be seen.
