&gt;Next installment- The final chapter! The journey home!  ( I could drag this
&gt;out more, but folks have been quoting lines from  &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las
&gt;Vegas&quot; at me: &quot;Just... finish... the.... F_at_#$ing... STORY!!!!)

Hay, if the people that are giving you a hard time don't want to read your
story, don't they have sense enough to hit the delete key and let those of
us who enjoy a good trip report read on?

I guess not having manners and not having brains go hand in hand.
