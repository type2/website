&gt;The &quot;business end&quot; of the heater is ~ the same size as the sump plate.
&gt;With such a small contact area, against the large, cold, mass of
&gt;aluminum/magnesium engine case, flywheel housing, and transaxle case,
&gt;it just doesn't seem like 150 watts would have much effect.

FWIW, I used to have an oil pan heater on my Ch*vy.  I only lived in
Kansas City, but I was on this kick of making it easier on my engine
in the winter.  The heater I had was a brick about 3x4x2 and magnetic.
I stuck it on the side of my oil pan (stamped steel) and also used
a big piece of pipe strap around it and the oil pan, like a big pipe
clamp, for extra safety.  The 3x4 was the contact surface.  IIRC it
was either ~120W or ~200W.  I had it on a timer to turn on about 4
hours before I left for work in the morning.

For a while, it had a marked effect...if I plugged it in the car
turned over quickly and started right up, and if I didn't, it turned
over sluggishly and took a little longer to start.  I was attributing
all this wonderfulness to the oil being thinner and better flowing,
but a few months later, my battery died -- it was four or so years
old.  I suspect that the heat in/around the engine was doing more
for the tired battery than it was for the oil.

I don't think the idea with these things is to heat the whole
engine case or block, but just to warm up the oil some so it flows
better when you start the engine.  I would figure that if you
start the engine with the clutch disengaged, all you have to worry
about is the engine.  After the engine has warmed up a little, you
can engage the clutch and let it spin the trans in neutral to warm
it up some, then clutch, shift into gear, and go.  Keep in mind
though that I have never lived north of about Kansas City, so I
may be misinformed.  :)
