Subject: reduction gear box

My bus had been making some noises for a while, and I was not able to figure
out where it was coming from until last week.

Coming out of a full stop at a traffic light, my left rear wheel locked up
completely, and I came to a screeching halt. Turns out the rear wheel
bearing outer race cracked/split.

I had it towed to my mechanics.  My mechanic and I are thinking that while I
have it opened up, I should replace all the bearings in there. 

Any ideas what would cause this? Or other things I should look to check?

Thanks,

-Kevin
