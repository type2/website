Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not/Front is Front

front is the direction towards the front of the.   Rear is towards the hind 
end of the bus.  If you are behind the bus, the forward end of the motor is 
away from you, you are looking at the rear of the motor.  The flywheel is at 
the FRONT of the motor, not the rear.  

anyway, sounds to me like you could reshim it.  You are not maxed out on 
shims, I'd replace the grooved one.

&lt;&lt; Oh really? That would be outstanding if I didn't have to rebuild it. I 
didn't check the front
 bearing (how do you do that with the case together and the oil slinger in 
the way?). I was told to
 take the flywheel off, take the seal out and move the crankshaft back and 
forth in the case and feel
 the rear bearing for movement. When I did this the rear bearing did move but 
only .001 to .002 in.
 In fact it is hard to tell that the bearing is moving at all but after doing 
it a number of times, I
 can feel a very slight movement.
 
 The shims are .010, .008 and .011 in. One of them has a groove worn in it 
where the flywheel was
 turning against it. The mechanic I was talking to said this wear on the shim 
is a symptom of too
 much end play.
 
 Do you think I should just re-shim it and keep on truckin'?

 I wouldn't be to quick to condemn a motor with that amount of end play.  spec
 is .003 to .005&quot;.  yours if not far out and could probably be safely
 reshimmed.  I'd take into account other factors- how is the compression, does
 the front main bearing move?  what amount of shimmage does it already have?
