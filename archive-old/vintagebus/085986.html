Subject: Engine full of gas

My 65 is sitting waiting for paint and it has twice had a problem.  The 
crankcase if filling up with gas.  In 36 years I have never seen this.  I took off 
the fuel pump and it is not punctured or leaking.  So, is my metering valve 
stuck open and the carb and continuing to fill up an run over?
