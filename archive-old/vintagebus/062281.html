Subject: RE: [VB] Jack point repair


Hi All,
Costco has a terrific floor jack for $69.95.  Way cool to jack up the real
of a type I high enough to remove the engine.  It's heavy enough to take 2
guys to lift it into a truck or your bus.

********************************************************
Brings tears to me eyes to hear all of these jack point problems. I feel as
if I discovered long lost relatives. I discovered my rust problem the first
time I went to change a tire, (that was after getting the bolts broke loose
at the tire shop, another thread at a different time). The pieces that come
outwards from the frame, outriggers(?), that the jack points weld to were
rotted beyond use. Been using a $26 1/2 ton floor jack and a 4X10 chunk of
wood for height to change tires when necessary. (still have to sop by the
tire shop to break the bolts loose, buts that's the other thread)
