Subject: re: sliding windows

Hi,

Here's the response I received from the seller.

Thanks,
Conrad

----------

Hi my friend, Sorry, but which is the Part, that you
this speaking (Slinding Windows). If it is the Slinding
Windows, normally, had been sold, some Pairs, for until
U$150, but this Pair, only reached U$63, the cost of
each Pair of Slinding Windows, here in Brazil, is U$80,
but, I goes to honor, the value of the Bid, that given
in the Ebay (U$63). In briefing, I will be placing
another Pair of Slinding Windows, in my Auctions in the
Ebay.
Thanks
your Brazilian friend
Agnaldo
