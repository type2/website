Subject: Re: L*xus tank ad -- trouble ahead?

I con't think the photographer for the Lexus ad has any choice. Same for 
vw and porshe. I believe that if either expects the protection from the 
court, they must be vigorous in the defense of their property. Of course, 
this is just a laymans opinion, but I am fairly well schooled concerning 
copyrights.
