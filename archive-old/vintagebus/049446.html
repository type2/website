&gt;Texas has a new law which allows counties to invoke a public nusense
&gt;(spelling?) law. The law states that the owner of a property cannot have
&gt;any unsitely items that can be seen from a public street or road.


It's actually worse than this - some counties/towns have a law that says
non-running and/or non-registered cars can be hauled off to the crusher
(after 'reasonable efforts to contact owner'), EVEN IF THE VEHICLE IS ON
PRIVATE LAND. So much for finds like Thom's......

While the List is not a place to discuss politics, I have one suggestion:

&gt;&gt; GET INVOLVED IN LOCAL POLITICS, AND MAKE SURE YOUR
&gt;&gt;ALDERMAN/COUNCILMEMBER/ETC  KNOW YOU OPPOSE STUFF LIKE THIS!!

I have written several letters to folks here in Austin every time the Lege
brings this crap up. Some political folks actually like old cars, and when
you point out the diff between the 82 buick up on cinderblocks vs the
'in-progress' 66 samba, they will often simply ask you to tidy or tarp it.


And yes, tit for tat - if a neighbor ratted you, get the city code book,
and find something THEY are in violation of. Like that deck that's too
close to the fence :)

A simple conversation w/ the person FIRST, of course, is recommended.
