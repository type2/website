Subject: Re: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them
  down?

Oooooh, finally a question I can answer authoritatively.

1. YOU sing. You can sing the same thing over and over if you don't know 
many songs, because they like repetition anyway. This works 100% of the 
time.

2. If for some reason you can't sing, it don't hurt 'em to cry. But it's 
better to sing.

3. Top Recorded Music for Kids that Adults Can Still Stand:

	Momma Come Quick (Bonnie Raitt)

	The Man in the Moon is Smiling (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	The Recipe for Love (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	I'm an Old Cowhand (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	Would You Rather Be a Mule (Dave Van Ronk)

We've had good luck with Spin Doctors, Blues Traveller, Susan Tedeschi, 
Doctor John and Bonnie Raitt the Goddess of the Universe. Children's 
music that (surprisingly) does not trigger a gag reflex in adults 
includes soundtracks from Disney's &quot;Lion King&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the 
Beast&quot;. You can skip over the Elton John parts if you want and they 
don't really mind.
