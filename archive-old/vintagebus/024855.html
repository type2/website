Clara &amp; anyone else that cares,

After our exchange this afternoon my curiosity was piqued, so I rummaged
around the garage. What I found is in the table below. The Bay Bus info
is for comparison... it is the cylindrical motor from an early '70s Bus.
The old Bug info is just 'cause I pulled it out.

Motor From      Part No.       Volts   A      B      C
'65 Bus        211 955 111 N     6v   15mm   5mm   14mm
Bug yr. unk.   111 955 113 F    12v   21mm   6mm    9mm
Bay Bus        211 955 113 G    12v
mid-'60s Bug   113 955 111 G     6v

The dimensions are as follows:
A = distance from center of drive shaft (output from gear box) to center
of pin that connects to the wiper linkages
B = diameter of pin that connects to wiper linkage
C = length of pin that connects to wiper linkage (including a shoulder
that keeps linkage away from wiper crank arm.

The pin length is different because the Bus has two arms that attach to
the pin, the Bug only has one. To make a new pin, you also have to acct.
for the thickness of the crank arm (add to dimension above).

Another difference that I had forgotten is that the 12v 2spd motor has
more wires. The old Bus motor had 3 spade connects labeled 54d, 31b, 31.
The new motor had 5 connects: 53, 53b, 31b, 53a, 31. I was running a Bug
wiper switch with a Bay bus washer bottle, but my 2 spd Bug and Bus
switches have the same number of connectors on them. The old bus switch
is P/N 211 955 517. This of course means running some more wires.

As I recall, I took about 8 hrs doing this conversion and, other than
the Bug switch, it was invisible from the outside. I can check when it's
light out, but I don't believe the heater tubes were damaged in any way
to make this work (the Bus has been scrapped, but the front clip is in
the chicken coop). 

I hope this makes sense w/o being too tedious! If anybody wants to try
this, combine this post with my old post (search for &quot;Wiper and motor
and conver* and mods&quot; in the archives) and you should have enough info
to do it yourself... or get yourself a dropping resistor!

&gt; only year they came on.    65s had a one year only  6Vone speed self parking
&gt; motor with a bracket.  The 66 and 67 motors are both cylinders and exactly the
&gt; same shape (only the voltage had been changed)- the 65 is not.    65s use the
&gt; push pull switch.   If you had a 66 motor in there perhaps the
 -SNIP-
&gt; instead of the cam operated switch that my '65 6v 2 speed motor used
&gt; (which is what failed... the motor is still good).

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  The only difference I encountered was
&gt; &gt; the distance between the drive shaft (out of the gear box) and the
&gt; &gt; attachment point on the crank arm. I had to move this pin, which I
&gt; &gt; detailed in a post to the old list (prior to the split).
