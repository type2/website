I think we're confusing &quot;belly pans&quot; which in &quot;list context&quot; (perl joke)
are the 3 panels used under the CARGO area of the bus.  I think our friend
was referring to *pedal* pans, which just go under the CAB of the bus.

&gt;Actually the front pan is a splash pan. Just for clarification Barndoors are
&gt;the only years that I know of that have factory splash pans. The belly pan is
&gt;for Deluxe and any type of double door bus throughout the split years.
&gt;You could make one but it doesn't need it.
