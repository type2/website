Subject: re;target ad and ESPN, tire diameter
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i noticed 2 different ads for target 1 long and a short one both used the same bus, i posted about the first one a week or so ago
    did anybody see the VW drags and show on ESPN 2 this morning (sun)
i only caught the last 5 minutes and it wasn't listed in my tube guide
VW on a major rise, must be to have a show on ESPN 2 live long and prosper.
    next: does any body know the diameter of the 15 tire on a early
60's splitty, need the number to match the 15&quot; 6/8 plys i found, trying to match the height exactly
