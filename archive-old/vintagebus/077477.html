Subject: WOW! Bentley discussions

So... Daughter has a VR6 Passat with a bad head gasket.  Time to start 
planning the repair.  Off to Google to find that last year Bentley 
FINALLY published a repair manual for it.  While poking around 
Bentley's site I stumbled upon their &quot;Discussions&quot;.  WOW!  It looks 
like they took a lesson from their visit to the Vanagon list.  Tons of 
good information.  (Including that the B4 Passat paper manual and CD 
are identical. Paper = 2400 pages and $170. CD $66 on ebay.)

Topics include:

Air Cooled VW '52-'79
Vanagon '80-'91
Eurovan '92-on
Volkswagen General information.

Vehicles include all German + Mini.

Looks to be a fairly large number of posts by the folks at Bentley.

You can find it at:  &lt;http://tech.bentleypublishers_dot_com/index.jspa&gt;

Worth a bookmark here.

Jim
