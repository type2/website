Various people have suggested that there's a &quot;monstrous short&quot;
somewhere in the system.  Indeed, there obviously is.  The most
obvious candidates would be the battery&lt;-&gt;starter cable insulation cut
through, or...the battery itself.  A completely discharged battery can
pull a huge amount of current.  If abused sufficiently, the plates can
short across each other, and provide a strongly conductive path.

Try disconnecting the battery, then try jump-starting the bus (using
the frame as a ground, connecting to the battery obviously won't
work).  If it works normally, the battery or the cable are your
culprits.
