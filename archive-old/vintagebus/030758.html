Subject: 40 Weber Jetting

I have finally had the time to get all of the jetting done on the dual Weber 40 IDF's I have on my
Thing. It runs so smooth. No flat spots, perfect idle. I just need to pull them one more time to
install the fat (1/4&quot;) rubber carb to intake manifold gaskets in order to stop that mid range whistle.
Anyone going the dual Weber or Dellorto route remember to add these. It does nothing for performance
but gets rid of an annoying sound. For anyone looking at jetting the 40 IDF's to a 1776 here is what I
have settled on so far. F7 emulsion tube (this is a big deal as it makes the transition from idle jet
to main smoother and the carbs are shipped with F11's which are more for quick high rpm like drag
racing). 200 Air Correction. 125 main jets. 55 idle jets. I have not changed out the venturis yet. I
have a set of 32mm venturis (the carbs come with 28mm venturis) that I am going to try. In theory this
is supposed to slow the air a little to allow the jets to do their job better. I would guess that this
would give you a little better top end and a little less bottom end. I may put the 32mm venturis in the
Thing and the 28's in my Double Cab and see what difference I end up with. The Thing is running
incredible now. This is one thing to watch out for if you are deciding to go with dual Webers. You need
to include jetting work in your budget. You will spend at least $100 on jets and stuff and it is pretty
easy to get to $200 just in jets. Emulsion tubes and venturis are expensive and everything is X 4. Now
I need to get it all done on the Double Cab so I can start driving it again.
hope this helps someone,
