ronnie writes: kymco makes 2, 9 pin relays, one is for a bug and the other
for a bus, the problem most people have is not getting or ordering the right
one, the one for the bus comes with an extra diode and an extra set of
instructions for the bus installation, which makes it a breeze, yes it's a
little pricey, but at least somebody went through the trouble to figure it
out and make it as simple as possable to install, kudo's for kymco, i have
these in stock and could copy them probaly and  sell them for a little less
money, but why, support those who help keep us going, you can purchase it
from me or kymco, (i think i sell it for a couple dollars less then them to
the public,but i also had to buy a decent quanity) major cash outlay in
order to do this.

hope this helps

&gt; Do you have the instruction sheet from the Kymco installation?  If some
one 
&gt; were to publish that to the list it might save us all a lot of hassle and 
&gt; money!  Anyone else?

JP,

The instruction sheet is on the web at www.kymcovw_dot_com.  It doesnt have
enough in the way of isntructions to tell you how to build one.

peas,

Steve
