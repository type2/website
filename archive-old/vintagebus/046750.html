 I've decided I need a better engine lid for the 59 double cab.  Mine has
 welded hinges and the prop lid support nut is in the wrong position...
 anyone have a nice (or NOS) decklid?  Correct years would be 59-60 but up to
 64 will work since I have the correct prop rod already.
  &gt;&gt;
- isn't it the same 59- early 64 model- with the elbow prop.    they gave the 
spring prop as of late dec 63
