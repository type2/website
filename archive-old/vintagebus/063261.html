&gt; i notice when i pulled my engine that my accelerator cable is slowly slicing

&gt; suggestions of remedies...i was thinking of sliding some fuel line over it,

&gt; in the tranny is pretty bad, at least 1/8&quot;.

I got a stock bug cable sheath, cut the body end off and joined it to the
body using a short piece of brake reservoir hose.
This comes from a real VW mechanic not me.:)
