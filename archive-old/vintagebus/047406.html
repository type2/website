 Charlie Hammil and Moe _at_ transporter gardens both have roto's, they attach
 the buses at the bumper mounts, Charlie had a Barndoor in his and Moe had a
 single cab in his, you should try to contact one of them , I'm sure either
 would be happy to send you plans, or better yet just come down to the
 classic and check them out in person.

 I was thinking of making a rotissory contraption to better work on 
 the underside of the bus.What is a good way to attach it to the 
 bus?are the bumper bracket mounting holes strong enough?or do I 
 need to attach it to the beam?or??
 
 thanx-cameron

...............While cleaning up some stuff the other day I found pictures of 
a roterisserie, with a 1953 truck in it.  THis one was designed and buildt by 
Micheal Haines, and he was offering it for sale at $550.  Think he sent this 
to me a couple years ago, and I have no space to roll a bus around on a 
rotisserie inside.   If I had a scanner I would scan the pic I have,   looks 
like the front part attaches at where the front beam attaches (must remove 
beam) and the rear part where at the rear torsion tube (must remove 
transaxle.)  His phone number is listed as (541) 770-7411, in Medford, Oregon
