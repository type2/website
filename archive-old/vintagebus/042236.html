&gt; VW Howard and I have been talking about just that. We want to have a

&gt; details yet, being there is no bus events on the west coast in July.

umm, Joshua Tree is a national monument, which doesn't exactly go with &quot;do
what you want&quot;.  Perhaps some nice spot on BLM land, like El Mirage dry
lake would be better?
