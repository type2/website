I don't know if that aggravates the problem but it sure aggravates the
symptom. Any sudden acceleration, deceleration or bump causes a clunking
from the loose boxes. The boxes on my Dcab where loose when I got it six
years ago. I always thought that the clunky sounds came with bus ownership.
After being on the list a while I discovered this and many other mistakes
that I had made. Viva the list.
