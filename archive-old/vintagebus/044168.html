Thom, I say Let 'em!!  We're all brothers.  I have a 75 &amp; 76 Westy along with my 66 camper, even though the 66 is by far my favorite, I still love to drive the bays occasionally!  Anyway, that's 2 cents worth (if that) from a non-purist!

I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of bay-window
pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I allow 
the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail from 
my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I don't
support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for bay-windows - 
does one exist?
