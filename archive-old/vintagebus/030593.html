I've never tried this, but per the Nov. Wolfsburg West  E news letter,   here
you go:



&quot;Tools/supplies required:
Sanding block
Lint free fabric
Spray paint (Krylon, Rust-O-Leum etc.)
Lacquer thinner or other suitable solvent
Automotive polishing compound or wax

1. Prepare a sanding block or block of wood by attaching a thin
   lint free fabric to the sanding surface. This sanding block
   surface will be the tool used to remove the excess paint on
   the hubcap.
2. This process is best performed on chrome hubcaps. Painted caps
   tend to loose the crispness of the logo making it nearly im-
   possible to achieve a smooth edge.
3. Using typical &quot;run of the mill&quot; spray paint, spray the emblem
   with one good heavy coat. This is one of those instances
   where two thin coats is not better than one heavy coat.
4. Immediately after spraying the cap and with the paint still
   very wet, rub your sanding block with the fabric attached over
   the logo surface of the hubcap. Don't worry about removing
   all of the paint but concentrate on making the edges as clean
   as possible. If the paint starts to get to tacky, apply a
   LITTLE lacquer thinner or suitable solvent to the surface of
   the lint free fabric. With the majority of the paint removed,
   let the paint dry hard before proceeding to the next step.
5. There are several ways to remove the balance of the paint left
   on the cap. Polishing compound and/or polishing wax is a good
   start. If the leftover paint is somewhat large, apply a small
   amount of lacquer thinner or suitable solvent onto a towel and
   rub gently.
6. Don't loose any sleep if you make a mistake. Your work can
   easily be erased with lacquer thinner.
7. We have found that curing the hubcap in a normal household
   oven helps the paint adhere better to the surface of the
   hubcap.  &quot;

Hey, I knew archiving those dumb things would come in handy some day. :-)
