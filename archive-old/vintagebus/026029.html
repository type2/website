Ok here's my .02
The Tinkertoy runs real good up to about 67 mph.  As y'all know, she's a

67 with reduction gears and all that.  I have noticed though that
prolonged over 60 mph a few things happen after 20+ minutes.

The oil temp that at 55 stays below 165 starts climbing to 195 - 200.
My oil pressure drops with the commensurate increase in temp.  I'm
running remote oil cooler a-la Hoover (the flat plate with thermostatic
fan in the left battery tray).  I am unsure if the increase in temp is
because the intakes cannot supply the demand for air between the cooler
and the fan or if i am simply overrevving her.  When I come off speed,
it's like a slug of cool oil makes its way out of the cooler and into
the case where the sensor waits.  It's either that or the demand for air

is less and so the cooler can then function.  I might try and rig a
manometer into the engine room and see what i get for relative pressures

at different speeds.  That's an experiment for a different day.  If I
manually run the fan when running over 60 the temps do stay at the lower

level.  I'm already running elephant ears and I might remove them to see

if that makes a difference.

I try to keep in mind that I'm driving a 32 year old vehicle and that
she really wasn't made for all this speed all the time.  So I'll follow
this thread with interest.  Time to go work on the Dor.
Later
Dave
