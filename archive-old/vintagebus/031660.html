I need a perfect piece of Westy table trim to repo, a couple of inchs will
do, if anyone can help please p-mail me.
ronnie
ps. this is for a sun-hatch, gray? trim for table and cabinet edges.

to: robert davis,

I need a good (non faded) piece to copy. My guy said it will take approx 6
weeks start to finish to have made. My samples didn't pass as they are
pretty faded and scared, also I didn't want to hack the 1 whole table piece
I have as I am not going to dolly (restore) my interior. So the sooner I
find a good piece to copy it WILL be done, no problem

So, do you already have the table trim repopped and packaged?  :)
