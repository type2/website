Subject: Re: Sixth Annual VW Buses n Boats  Campout- near  Cincinnati 
  Ohio

I for one prefer a full blown relaxing campout to a show that happens to 
have camping anyday.
I am simply not one of those people that likes the shows, and prefers to 
camp. I think both of
these events target slightly different bus owners, and like Greg 
mentioned they are at least quite
a few miles apart. I think the important thing that weekend is to go 
somewhere in the bus ;)
