Subject: Realign Dizzy Drive Pinion

Hi, all,
I keep reading about distributor drive pinions being out of alignment.
It looks like everyone _lives_ with it. Maybe I missed the post, but has
anyone proposed pulling the pinion and taking another shot at it?
Forgive me if this is a repeat.

I build engines so infrequently that I expect to take a couple stabs at
the drive pinion before I get it right. It's not hard to pull it back
out and try again, especially if the engine is still out of the car.

I start two narrow, straight bladed screw drivers. Insert into the dizzy
drive slot, and then move the handles past each other so that they're
crossed in an &quot;X&quot;. Apply pressure to the sides of the drive slot and
pull the drive pinion out. Once you get a feel for it, it is a piece of
cake.

Look down the hole to make sure the two washers at the bottom of the
hole are still aligned with the pinion... probably need a flashlight. If
they were coated with grease when they were installed they shouldn't
have moved. Use a screwdriver (non magnetized) to realign them if need
be. Make sure they don't get lost in the engine, or this will turn into
a big job (can you say teardown?).

You may be able to pull the pinion with a strong magnet, but I've never
done that. There is a bit of friction you would have to overcome, and
the magnetism might pick up the two washers.

I hope this is helpful to some.
