&gt; &gt; But following JP you would be doing at least 68 mph all the way here. Now if

&gt; Sounds about right for JP.  Barry though, well it averages out to probably
&gt; 55 if it's his 3.88.  65 downhill, 43 uphill. Sometimes Barry drives real
&gt; slow. :)

remember when barry had that 40 horse in his &quot;scientific labmobile&quot; and we caravanned from albuquerque to jerome?  every gas stop he'd be waiting for us only to nitrous off to the next gas stop.

i remember being kind of surprised that jp's fast bus, the brown one with the big engine (1641 with dual carbs), was such a slug but then it was the most loaded down too.

that bus got great mileage even for the two carbs and all the weight.  it must have been the &quot;rainbow power&quot; of that kid i toted up to flag.

sharing the road to and from a campout/show and visiting with good vw folks is what i think our hobby is all about.  that may be too generalized but i'm having some powerful good memories right about now.

cheers,
