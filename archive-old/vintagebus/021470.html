Subject: Trade bus photos??
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a whole box of photos that I have had developed, and would like to 
trade the doubles to anyone that has an interest the same as I do. I would 
like to trade 10 ( or more ) bus photos of my random selection for ten random 
photos that you might want to get rid of. All photos recieved will be 
treasured and archived in my huge collection of bus photos.
 P-mail for snail mail address.
       Mike
