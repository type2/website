&gt;&gt;  The only other varible is that there is a metal donut next to the spring 
and I  am not sure if the open end of the donut faces in toward the spring or 
out  toward 
the hole in which the odd bolt goes through.  &lt;&lt;


Hi Dan,
It looks like on our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion that the latter  
would be true.  Where are you located?  Mayhaps someone in your area  can let 
you take their bus apart in that area to see how it goes together.   The other 
possibility is you have a clutch spring and not a brake spring.
