&gt; Guess your all stuck with me.

Hi AL,
GOOD TO HEAR!  Eric's first engine he rebuilt broke the crankshaft shortly 
afterwards.  So due to that and shortly afterwards being in the USAF the next 
couple of engines he had built by a local VW dealer.  His fourth rebuilt 
engine he again built himself and could not keep up proper oil pressure.  
Tore this engine back down to find that the main bearings were one size 
bigger than the packaging they had been vaccum packed in from the factory in 
Germany!
  For the beginner mechanic the absolutely hardest way to get into an auto 
restoration is to do it yourself completely from the ground up.  The engine 
is the worst factor probably due to so many things can and so often will go 
wrong even for those with extensive VW mechanical experience let alone for 
the beginner.  So getting some outside help from time to time is no shame!  
Plus knowing that you are so close to having it running is a maddening 
situation.
Keep On VWing,
Eric&amp;Barb
