My two cents...

When I was a member of SOTO, back in the early 80's, I got the newsletter
regularly, but that's about all.  Admittedly I lived int the east, but
there were *no* eastern SOTO events scheduled.

Seems like dues were about $17 then -- even back then I often wondered
where all the money was going...

How did this new bloke get to be president?  Was he elected, or did he buy
the cow?
