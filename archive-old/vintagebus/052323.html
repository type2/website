Subject: Clutch Pedal

Hey, again...

I have a clutch pedal that does not fully return.  Probably going to take
the bus to the shop tomorrow, but I'd like to have a confident feel as to
the problem when talking to them.  It's not the pressure plate.  I replaced
that today.  Likewise I don't think it is the clutch lever spring, as it
looked OK to me.  Someone told me of a second spring up at the pedal.  Does
this sound right to you?  Are these springs still available? - Thanks

Kevin Albrecht
