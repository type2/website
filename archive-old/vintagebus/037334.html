&lt;&lt; I am restoring my front suspension, and since my &quot;needle&quot;bearing seems a 
 little worn I would like to replace them. Does anybody know their SKF 
 number or where I could get some new?

I think you have to get the link pin kit.  Probably you can get them 
separately, but the link pin kit comes with the needle bearings to do one 
beam.  Think a kit is about $100 US, and various VW mail order places carry 
them.
