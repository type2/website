&lt;&lt; So if the gallon was an unusually large amount do I need to drain some 
out? 
 I was careful to only fill the center section till it came out of the side 
hole.&gt;&gt;
Hi Scott,
Somehow communications seem to have gotten screwed up here. :)  The tranny 
with reductions should take most of a one gallon bottle.  If you have it too 
full all one has to do is to remove the filler plug, and if the VW is on a 
flat surface the excess oil will drip out of this opening.  By the way have 
you checked your steering box oil level?  Might be a good idea to do so.  It 
uses the same oil as the tranny.

&lt;&lt;By the way. Thank you for all your help. I appreciate the way you even 
reply to the little questions. You are always such a help. Have a great one.  
&gt;&gt;
Well thank you!  Glad we could help!   Eric&amp;Barb
