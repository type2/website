Subject: Door Seals - WW vs. German

List:

Has anyone got an opinion on the Wolfsburg West door seal/weatherstrip?  They also sell German weatherstrip, which about twice the price.  WW stuff is grey other with black inner, German is black/black, I think.  WW sez their stuff is softer, not sure if that's good or bad.

I'd love to save a few bucks and get the cheaper, uhhh, let's say less expensive stuff.  But then again, is it the age old pay now or pay later?  I really don't want to have to replace this stuff a year or two down the road.

TIA.

Robert
