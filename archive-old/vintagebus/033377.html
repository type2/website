Subject: Re:  [VB] Sticky/worn turn signal switch...
To: jdparker_at_lava_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello again,
   Thank you for the vent wing rubber info.  I finally have non leaking
vent wings(I hope).  Is there such a thing?
   Another question if I may.  Does anyone have experience with a
possibly worn turn signal switch that will not click or &quot;Stay&quot; to the
left or the right.  It will mostly just spring back to the off
position.  Is it gunk and crud that is stuck in there somewhere or are
there stops and things that can get too worn over the years?  What can I
do?  WD-40?  Thanks, --JD

you can take the switch off the column by unding the two little screws-  use 
the right size scredriver so as not to mush them and dont lose them.    now 
take the part with the arm, and undo the two screws that hold the cover on.  
dont lose those either.  slide the cover off, think you have to unscrew the 
knob at the end of the arm first. now you see the turn sig stuff.   you can 
leave it wires hooked up, and see if WD-40 helps.  It could.  some times the 
detents are worn, and sometimes the springs.
