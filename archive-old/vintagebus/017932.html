Well, I suggest the *first* thing they do is kick the water-pumpers out.
We see slammed Jettas and New Beaters with big stereros EVERY FREAKIN' DAY.
Make some more room for VINTAGE stuff.
And move the swap to the side parking lot, which would have the added benefit 
of putting all the swap stuff on one spot, and making more space for cars
inside.

You know what would be a cool venue for a show like that?  Golden Gate Park!

I wonder if there's any place in the Sacramento area where you could do something
like that.  Sac Raceway sucks for having shows; it's hot, dirty, and LOUD.  
The drag racing noise really wears you down.

&gt; car show.  They also think it is a great place for a show (on the glass, 
&gt; rather than a hot parkig lot,  occasional shade trees, victorian buildings)   
&gt; But the show is too big for everyone to drive in now.  SO will they move to 
&gt; another, larger,concrete place?  Or limit who can drive in?   What criteria 
&gt; for who can drive in?  25 years or older ?    show/swap only?   (but why 
&gt; shove the Daily driver people out?)
