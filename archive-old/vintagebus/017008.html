&gt; loose.
&gt; Well, it's not loose, and I cannot tell if it is broken.  Using a 
&gt; pry bar, I
&gt; tried to lever up the front of the tranny in hopes that I would hear 
&gt; the
&gt; aforesaid &quot;klunk&quot;, but to no avail.
&gt;

the front mount has fooled me on the same kind of test,-

pry pry
not loose...

dose the klunk happen when you let off the accelerator?
is the klunk becoming more frequent?
my symptoms got worse until i put in a new front mount
it still looked fine on the VW, until i removed it .
it was in two pieces.

bye
ken
