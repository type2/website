&gt;We are working on 10-15+amp units, heavy duty, for these applications.
&gt;They will provide a steady 6-7volts without much variance. Expect to
&gt;have them done soon, with low cost. Not as good as total componet
&gt;replacment, but safer than a hot resistor.

Are these switching regulators?  If so then they should definitely
run cooler than a simple dropping resistor.  If they are linear
regulators, then they will dissipate just as much heat as a simple
dropping resistor, but the benefit is that they are self-adjusting.
