&gt; &gt; Actually, my delivered price is the same or slightly lower (including
&gt; &gt; listmember discount and factoring in shipping cost to most zip codes).

&gt; Couldn't this be shipped via United States Post Office,
&gt; book rate (real cheap) to * any * US zip code for the same price?



I ship them via either UPS or Priority Mail. There's a reason why we haven't
used book rate, but offhand I don't recall which of these it was: either too
slow, or uninsurable against loss/damage, or both.  Incidentally, it seems
the USPS is going to a zoned system like UPS (where rate is based on
distance): the local post office just gave me a UPS-like zone chart the
other day.
