Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In my garage, which needs desperately to be extended
to four bays from its current two, are four 1967
Beetles, what's left of a '69 Ghia I cut up for parts,
two push mowers, 6hp/60gal air compressor, MIG welder,
Oxy-acetylene setup, pressure washer, beer fridge,
frozen pie machine, a load of parts for the '67's and
for my bus, a bicycle, a truck tool box, HVLP sprayer,
and more sundry tools than it's convenient to list
here. 

Since it's so packed in there, it means that my riding
lawnmore, my motorcycle, my '71 bus, one of my Ghias,
my pickup, and my wife's SUV has to live in the
driveway, much to the chagrin of my neighbors. Boy
would they be pissed if I brought home the other Ghia
and my '67 Beetle 'vert. 

Anyone wanna buy a project car? The '67's (other than
the 'vert) and the bus are all for sale. If you're
interested, check out info on
www.geocities_dot_com/ignatius.geo or p-mail me.

For that matter, if you want the bicycle ($250 for a
$1000 bike with 100 miles on it) or the truck tool box
($75, locks, fits a Chevy S-10 or similar sized
pickup) go ahead and p-mail me. 

Sincerely,
John Cloonan

&gt; &gt; It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the
&gt; topic I proposed a couple of
&gt; &gt; days ago.
&gt; &gt; Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own
&gt; experience, I realized long
&gt; &gt; ago that my garage will probably never hold my
&gt; &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my garage
&gt; &gt; now resides the following:
&gt; &gt; A 1961 ragtop beetle &quot;off the pan&quot; on the right
&gt; side, with the beetle pan on
&gt; &gt; the left side.
&gt; &gt; Piled on top of that, two aftermarket floor pans,
&gt; two complete sets of
&gt; &gt; engine tin for a 1500, three 6V starters, and
&gt; various other engine parts.
&gt; &gt; Between the beetle and it's pan sit an air
&gt; compressor, oxy-acatelyne welding
&gt; &gt; set up and a mig welder.
&gt; &gt; To round out the clutter, there's various lawn
&gt; chairs, a dog cage, gas cans
&gt; &gt; and at least three trash bags full of crushed beer
&gt; cans waiting to be cashed
&gt; &gt; in.
&gt; &gt; In the driveway, sits my '66 Westy along with a
&gt; '64 beetle convertible
&gt; &gt; (non-runner) and an '81 rabbit convertible (son's
&gt; daily driver).
&gt; &gt; My wife's has long ago given up the idea of
&gt; parking anywhere but on the
&gt; &gt; street.
