Just my opinion, and I know this subject has come up many times in the past, but wouldn't you think VW spent lots of $$ having engineers (fluid dynamics guys included) studying the airflow around the bus, and figuring out the best way to get the proper air flow in there? And over years of development? Maybe the reason for eventually flipping the louvers (or was that cosmetic)? Granted, they might not have been running the larger engines of today, but for a stock engine.....

Any engineers out there feel like building a finite element model of the bus and the flow in that area? I don't think VW had this capability back then :-)

&gt; Didn't Hoover or somebody do tests last year about wether or not those things
&gt; helped.  Whomever it was found that at low speeds the bus wasn't causing
&gt; enough turbulence that more air was actually getting in, but at higher speeds
&gt; there was a turbulence that forced the air in better straight into the vent
&gt; and the scoops actually inhibited air flow at high speed.  There was
&gt; something about a 4&quot;, 6&quot;, or 8&quot; ???? turbulent zone down the sides coming off
&gt; the front of the bus cutting ever so fluently through the air, that inhibited
&gt; the scoops from being effective for getting air into the engine compartment.
&gt; Don't quote me on any of this, but it made sense at the time.  Somebody must
&gt; have the archives from back then.
