&gt; You may want to note that 5mm screws can usually be replaced with
&gt; American 10-32's.

At first I thought &quot;What?!?!&quot;, then I did the math.  The standard pitch
for 5 mm screws is 0.8 mm.  This works out to:

           inches    mm
5 mm/0.8  0.314961  0.8
10/32     0.3125    0.79375

Most of the time, if you try to mix up metric and inch nuts and bolts,
you know it right away - the nut will get less than one turn onto the
bolt before stopping.  There is a slightly bigger size where it's a lot
harder to tell - you can get the bolt almost all the way through the nut
before it binds.  Looking at the numbers, I _think_ this might be
5/16-24 (7.9375 mm nominal diameter, 0.944882 mm pitch) and M8-1.0.

I like to keep metric machines metric just on general principle.  On a 5
mm or #10 fastener, it doesn't matter as much, because it probably has a
screwdriver head.  Bigger than that and it has a hex head, and it's
really annoying to have to remember to carry that one inch-size wrench
for that one bolt you replaced.
