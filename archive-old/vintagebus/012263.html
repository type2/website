Subject: accelerator/idle problems

Hello all,
Down in Houstons here, since August. Today is probably the coldest day I have been here, although it is not really that cold(compared to my home-Boston). Anyway II woke up this morning to a cold rain and figured I better drive to school instead of biking due to the weather.

I run out and try to start the bus, real difficult to turn over. Perhaps I need a starter overhaul, as sometimes it starts right away, sometimes it takes awhile.(Not neccesarily temperature related). 

Anyway eventually it starts up, but the engine is racing away, and the gas pedal feels a little funny. Kind of like when the spring on the end of the accelerator cable breaks. (This happened in August on my way down here, i put a new one in) 

So I runout to the bakc of the bus, pop the engine lid, and see the spring is fine, it is just not snapping the accelerator thingy back(nice technical term). So I try pulling up on the thingy, with no luck. I run back and turn the engine off as it was at quite high rpms. I then tap this arm mechanism thingy a few times with a socket wrench.(very gently) The piece loosens up, and I figure that is that. I move it back and forth a few times, no problems, feels as though it is moving properly. 

Go back in start it up, which it does quite easily. But again the engine is racing away. this time the gas pedal feels fine. I run back to check again, this time the arm is in what appears to be the correct position, and everything looks fine, but it is still revving away.

I thought I could just adjust the idle screw, but what would have caused teh idle screw to adjust so enormously. There must be some other problem.

Any ideas for an idiot?
