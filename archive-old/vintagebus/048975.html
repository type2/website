Hey listees,

    I was driving through the country yesterday and out of the corner of my eye I spotted a panel van behind some trees on the side of an automotive shop.  I immediately turned around and went back to look at it.  I am not sure how old the panel van is---filled with junk so I could not get a VIN number.  Every single piece of glass has been broken out of it and there is little left.  The panel van does have a nice set of side doors as well as a nice rear hatch lid.  What are these items worth before I hassle with the owner.  The speedo is also there but the glass is smashed.  The rear corners are smashed but the front is very nice.  Any advice????  Thanks

Greg
