Subject: Removed windshield, no rust! POR15 next time?

Hi,

I just removed my drivers side windshield. Its been leaking
for years. Surprisingly there was almost no rust under the
seal. 15 years ago I cleaned things out with sand paper and
naval jelly, and then sprayed on several coats of Zinc Rich
compound, painted on a coat of zinc chromate and then let
the paint shop do its thing. Well, considering the good
performance, should I repeat the process or should I use
POR15. Anyone have long term result stories with POR15?

If I do use the POR15, what kind of primer should I spray on
as the POR15 is hardening? Is rattle can OK? Or should I
pick up something from the local auto paint store?

What should I do about the rust pits? Weld and grind smooth?
Or can I put bondo over the POR15 somehow?

So many questions. Thanks for replies.

Chris.
