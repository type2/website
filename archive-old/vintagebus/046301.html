&lt;&lt; I'm not sure where the rack was made. I weigh 235 lb.(6'.5&quot; tall) and walk 
all over the rack with out bending. I was thinking that any Howl problem 
people have may be the position they mount the rack in. I have mine all the 
way it can go towards the front of the bus. I also had it Powder coated 
(silver), maybe the drag is reduced some over painted or rusty chipped paint 
racks.&gt;&gt;
Hi Kerry,
We think not due to running bug roof rack in exact same positions.  The USA 
made smooth zinc plated racks howl and the German racks textured painted made 
of thicker walled smaller diameter tubing do not howl.

Thanks!  We try our best.   Eric&amp;Barb
