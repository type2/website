Subject: Idea for an Anti-theft Device
Message-ID: &lt;e2c4c5ce.24510c3c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

To All:

All commercially available automobile anti-theft systems are well known to
car theives, who have developed methods of defeating such systems.  Having
put quite a bit of work into Grendel I thought it wise to come up with some
purely mechanical method of making her a bit harder to steal.  (ANY vehicle
can be stolen.  But like all cowards, thieves prefer to prey upon 'soft'
targets.)

Under the cockpit floor and attached to it, install a steel bar fitted with a
pivot at its upper end.  The bar is installed so that when free, a spring
presses it against the clutch pedal lever.  When the clutch pedal is
depressed, the bar swings over on top of the lever, preventing the clutch
pedal from retracting.

The bar may be retracted and latched in place either mechanically or
electrically and acutated in the same manner.  If solenoids are used they
would draw power only when the device is being actuated or reset.

In operation, once the clutch pedal is depressed, it remains locked in place,
effectively placing the transmission in neutral.

The device may also be installed on the brake pedal.

A microswitch on the pivot-end of the device may be used to trigger an alarm.
 (Once the alarm is triggered, WW-III begins :-)

Such mechanical locks can be easily defeated simply by removing the forward
belly pan... assuming the thief figures out how to circumvent various devices
attached to it.

I'm unwilling to provide further details for obvious reasons.  If you'd care
to explore the concept, a good machinist should have no trouble figuring out
the mechanical components after examining a splitties pedal arrangement.  Any
automotive electrician can provide data about solenoid-driven latches.

(Besides keeping your bus warmer, the forward belly pan provides an ideal
area for the placement of alarms, alarm system batteries and other
components.)
