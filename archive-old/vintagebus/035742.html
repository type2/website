 As for the recent oil temp thread, I had my new (250
 miles) 1776 in my '61 Westy, towing my new singlewheel
 trailer (serial number 04), and experienced
 interesting oil temps and fuel mileage numbers.  The
 engine is a new case, new big valve heads, new P&amp;C's,
 counterbalanced crank, new 100 Engle cam, and dual
 Weber 34's, and is balanced within an inch of it's
 life.  On the way north, caravanning with Barry, Kerry
 in his highroof, and Angela (of Grooveedubs), I ran
 very hot (up to 240+) on the way north, but off and
 on, and very unintuitive temps vs. conditions.  Like
 downhill, the temperature would rise, but when the
 engine was working hard, the temperature would fall. 
 And I was getting a bit over 21 mpg.  On the way back
 today, my temperature never got above about 220, and I
 averaged better than 25 mpg.  Approximately same
 ambient temps, notwithstanding waking up to snow.
 
 Anybody got any ideas about why?  Break in the engine
 and it runs cooler?  Why the increase in mileage?
  &gt;&gt;

were you going generally uphill on the way there?     Did you cruise in 
neutral down hills or leave it in gear?  I used to do the former, then 
realised the latter helps it cool better.  or maybe it was damper on the way 
back (dry air does not cool as well).  Actually I think I tend to get better 
milage going uphill, which is also counterintuitive.  the oil temp does have 
a lag though, from engine producing heat, and then the cooling has a lag too. 
 AT least your guages are not tied together.  yesterday I demostrated this to 
a friend-  look idle- it reads 250.  rev it up - reads 190, let it idle, back 
to 250. rev it up, back to 190.  boy it sure heats up and cools down fast.  
why, I just dont trust those numbers.

Glad you had a good trip  :)
