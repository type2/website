&lt;&lt; I have been using the foil covered insulation board for some years. It is
 simple to cut to shape, and by cutting vees on the inner side you can match

Hi Kyle,

The mor products to pick from the better!  Still we would use the tar first on
the sheet metal that would both protect against moisture in there and glue the
insulation in place.  Eric &amp; Barb
