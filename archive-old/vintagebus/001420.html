Subject: Parts books

&gt; re parts list- vw kept making new parts and updating parts lists.  They came out with a new book probably every couple years, I have seen 56, 58, 61, 63, 66, 67  editions. 
&gt;
There's a '53 parts book too.  I recently located one and made the guy a very, very fair offer.  Unfortunately, he decided if I would offer him that much, he better put it on eBay... ;(

The '58 one is good for the early Buses, I send scans to people all the time.  '56 would be nice too, hmmmm.
