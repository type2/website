Over the years, I have collected a number of NOS parts, but have no idea
what they are for.  This past week a parts book came up in E-Bay, but even
though a couple of us went in on the bid, we were outbid at the last
moment.  I am at the point that I would like to get rid of the parts I will
not be using to restore my busses, but I have no idea what to sell and what
to keep.

I am looking for someone nice enough to sell me a copy of their parts
manual.  If you have any of the manuals, either for bus or bug, what would
it take for you to drop it off at a quick copy place, then send me the
repo.  There are a number of us who would like copies of the various
manuals, so while at the copy place, you might just have them run off a
number at one time.

I do not know how many pages are in a manual, but we are willing to pay for
your trouble, the cost of reproducing and mailing.
