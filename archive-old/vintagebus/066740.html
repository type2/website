Subject: oil temp sender mounting

I don't know what type of case you are running but if you happen to have a
universal case with the block off plate for a type 3 dipstick you can drill
the plate and weld in half a pipe union and install the sender there. Also
good for a thermostatic switch for an oil cooler electric fan. Just
something to ponder.
