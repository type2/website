Heh, heh. Yep, those would be the '67 Deeeeelucks handles. Look just like a
toilet flusher and why not? Dang sissy buses anyway, got all that frilly
chrome on them. NOS ones indeed. Find a nice used set for under a hundred
and you're doing good. Even if you find a cherry pair of them for $15 like I
did, you probably wouldn't sell them.

&gt; &gt;What do the inner front door handles look like on a '67 deluxe.  The ones
&gt; &gt;that came with my van look like toilet flushers!  These got misplaced
&gt; &gt;somehow, but I don't believe they are stock anyway.  Anyone have a
picture
&gt; &gt;or a description?  And, where can I pick up some NOS ones?
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Those are the correct handles.  The standard models have a white plastic
&gt; version.
