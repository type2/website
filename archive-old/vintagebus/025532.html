NO GEX!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh my god no!

if you want a brand new 1600 from the factory in mexico (solid or
hydraulic lifters-same cost) with EVERY SINGLE PIECE BRAND NEW, check
out http://www.aircooled_dot_net they are selling them cheaper than anywhere
else ive seen, and the customer service was awsome.

i just bought the hydraulic longblock from him, and love it! no more
valve adjustments!  :D  and super quiet too!

&gt; i know this is about the engine in my bug, but, it applies to bus engines as
&gt; well (sorry everybody but i need help:( )
&gt; 
&gt; While driving home from the NIVA show in Villa Park, IL. last weekend, my
&gt; clutch started to act up. It was slipping terribly. I figured, no big deal
&gt; ill take the drive back to peoria taking it  easy while Neil followed me in
&gt; his 71' panel. We pull over again on 355 and oil is just pouring out of my
&gt; sump.Dooh!!!!!!! My Buddies Neil and Jason (jasons engine in his bus locked
&gt; up 10 miles previously and had to get towed to a friends house)  gave it a
&gt; look and knew that my main engine seal was bad and leaking onto my clutch!!!
&gt; Ended up stopping every 40 miles to add oil. Made it home barely.
&gt; Start it up yesterday and there is a loud knocking (uh oh). Take it in to my
&gt; trusty VW mechanic and find out today my case is shot. The pulley has about
&gt; an inch of play against the case(front to back).
&gt; 
&gt; To make a long thread short-------Who is the most reputable company to buy a
&gt; longblock 1600 dp from. Im thinking of GEX at the moment. Definately not
&gt; MOFOCO.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the bug content , It can apply to a bus -  -
&gt; -pete
&gt; 59' panel
&gt; 74 super vert'
