Ahah,

Diameter, radius what's the difference?  The diameter is
about 26.5 measured horizontally. If you measure the radius
from ground contact to the center, you will find that the
bottom of the tire has flattened slightly depending upon
tire pressure and load.

Just went out to the garage and measured them again.  Rear
is about 12.5&quot;, front is about 12.75&quot;

Your engine RPM will be dictated by the radius not the
diameter.

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; Are you sure?  165SR15s have a 12.5 radius or 25&quot;
diameter.  P205/75R15s
&gt; should have about a 26.5&quot; diameter.   Eric&amp;Barb
