Subject: m-code questions again
Message-Id: &lt;v02140b08b3b510f04e7f_at_[196.2.38.68]&gt;

Hey Volks

I posted this mail at the time the list broke down, and only got one reply,
so here I go again:
&gt;
&gt;
A few questions arise from the M-code plates on my 63 Dormobile and 67
ambulance:

I have translated all the codes on the ambulance, except 007. I don't see
any hidden machine guns or ejector seats, so it's obviously not the special
secret agent package. Any ideas?

And on my Dormobile, I have accounted for all the m-codes. But, the bus has
a chromed VW emblem on the front and, given that I bought it with original
69 000 miles, I assume the chrome emblem dates from new. Was there an
m-code or any other way to tell if a bus was fitted with a chrome emblem?
It does have 181, chrome hubcaps.

Also on the dormer, the m-code plate lists port of delivery as EP. I know
the Kombi was converted to Dormobile by Martin Walter and Co of Folkestone,
Kent, and the finished camper was sold by the main London VW dealer. So the
'E' must mean England. And the 'P'? Which port?
