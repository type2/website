sorry make that $58 for two mirror arms


there is an ad for them on vwplanet under accessories for busses if i am bot
mistaken- i have the guys address at work otherwise. $5 for 2 arms so they
ain't cheap. good point re: the mirrors- then again are the mirrors that
different from the round ones that are being repopped? what makes the mirrors
different??

m
Who is selling them?  Where?  We were hoping they would be wider to give a
better view especially the passenger side.

ones
&gt; w/

&gt; arms. The actual mirrors
&gt; themselves are the hardest part to find.
