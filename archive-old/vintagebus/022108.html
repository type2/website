&gt;This is just a guess but would a Swiss prepped bus have different gearing in
&gt;the tranny or redux boxes to cope with the local topography? O seem to to
&gt;recall folks refering to &quot;mountain gearing.&quot;

Mountain (or Alpine) gearing had it's own m-code, 092.  It is a rare option, 
and out of the 450+ buses in NEATO's Old Bus Registry, none that are 
registered have this option on the build plate.

043 on the other hand, occurs on 15 buses.  All 15 are 1965-67 buses.
