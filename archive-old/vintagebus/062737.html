Subject: It's here!

All right I finally got my sundial today, but am a little sick at my 
stomach.  The battery wasnt secured and beat the heck out of my rear corner 
from the inside and fell out between here and CA.  So now there are about 
15-20 outy dents that have cracked the paint.  Guess the cut and polish is 
gonna have to wait.

Now that it is here I will begin re-doing the interior.  Once complete I 
will post plans on Thom's site.  Only gonna have a problem with 2 panels.  
The 2 rear corner panels are curved and have been shaved and steamed to fit 
in.  Anyone done this before?  Hope, I can remeber how it all fits back in.

Sundial site went down a few months back, hosting was about 25 a month.  
Don't know if I can get the dns servers to point to my home server, but will 
try and get it going soon.
