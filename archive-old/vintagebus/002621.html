I have no idea of the worth but there's a couple photos of another on my web
site at:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/photospanelvans.htm

I was told that that one never came with a passenger seat.

Do you need a 4th Bus?   That's like asking &quot;Do I need to breathe?&quot; :)

&gt;I am in the middle of negotiating the purchase of a double-door panel with
&gt;the famed mcode 199.  What would this bus be worth &quot;done&quot;
&gt;
&gt;As it is, it has cut wheel wells, mildly dented and rusty nose, rusty
&gt;driver's floor, and lots of extraneous holes throughout the bus.  No
&gt;engine.  Leaking reduction boxes.  Alleged new brakes.  Had an engine fire
&gt;and engine harness is wasted, but the rest of the wiring was new.  No
bumpers.
&gt;
&gt;The actuall 199 option was removed at one point, and he has another, but it
&gt;too will need work and donor piece before it's functional.
&gt;
&gt;Also, would such an 199 bus have a passenger seat?  Owner claims no, but I
&gt;think it looks like it did.  One other pic I have of such a bus does have a
&gt;passenger seat.
&gt;
&gt;What it boils down to is this: this would be a cool, unique bus to restore,
&gt;but do I really need a *4th* bus?  How rare is the 199 option?  What is the
&gt;360 option?  It also has 175.
