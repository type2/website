   Original Volkswagen Neuteile, better known as VW Discount Heussner &amp;
Stauber  and Fa. AXLE Stauber
telefon 0 55 43 / 94 11-0.
   For those of you that don't know, Axel has more NOS bus parts then 
anybody
I have ever seen. He is well known at OCTO/Classic weekend with piles of NOS
parts just laying on the ground, it's usully a feeding frenzy when he DUMPS
all the parts out!
   He has a beautiful catalog just packed full of parts and pictiures. You
can call him, I don't have his e-mail but I'm sure someone on the list does
and order a catalog from him, 30 DM's
