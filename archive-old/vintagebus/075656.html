Subject: Re: Electric Heat?

&gt;I am thinking of trying a mini ceramic electric heater in my bus this
&gt;winter for supplemental heat.  I have tried a 12 V electric heater like
&gt;this before and I ruined my generator due to the heater overloading it!

Insulate, or get the heat directly from burning hydrocarbons.  The best
engine in the world only gives you about 30% of the energy in the fuel.
You get to throw away 5% of that in the generator belt, 50% of that in
the generator, and maybe another 5% in the wiring.  So, you can get
0.30 * 0.95 * 0.50 * 0.95 = 13.5% of the chemical energy in the gasoline
as heat.

&gt;My question: Is there a maximum power draw that the bus charging system
&gt;can handle?

Yes.

Numbers, numbers, everybody wants numbers...

For a stock '64 Bus, like mine, at night, in the rain...

High beams         100   W
Wiper motor         20   W
Running lights      20   W
Instrument lights    4.8 W
Fuel gauge           1   W  (estimated)
  Sub-total        146   W at 100% duty cycle

Ignition coil       30   W  (estimated)
Brake lights        36   W
  Sub-total         66   W at 30% duty cycle (19.8 W continuous)

Turn signals        72   W
  Sub-total         72   W at 10% duty cycle (7.2 W continuous)

Grand total: 173 W continuously.  Allowing for 5% drop in the wiring
gives us 182 W.

Stock, my Bus would have had a 200 W nominal (300 W max) generator.
This leaves between 18 W and 118 W to run other things, charge the
battery, etc.

Note that the starter requires around 1200 W under load, so if it
runs for 5 seconds, that's at least 6000 W-sec you have to return to
the battery.  Typically, you have to put back at least 10% more than
you took out, so that's around 6600 W-sec.  At 118 W, that's a little
under a minute to charge the battery back up.  At 18 W, it's a little
over six minutes.

You can run the numbers on your own Bus to see how much juice you have
to play with.  One interesting note is that in the Bentley, the Bosch
generators have nominal and maximum (150% of nominal) values.  They
claim that the generators can deliver their maximum output continously
without damage, but I would guess that keeping the load down closer to
the nominal output would be better.

&gt;The mini ceramic unit that I am looking at is 12V DC input, 8.3 amp,
&gt;the heat output would be 100 watts and 340 BTU/hr.

Per http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/043445.html, you need
at least 210 Btu to heat the air in the back of a perfectly insulated,
non-leaky Bus from 0 F to 77 F - your heater could do that in 8 minutes.
If you plan on heating up the sheet metal, too, you need 2920 Btu.  That
heater would take around 9 hours to do that.
