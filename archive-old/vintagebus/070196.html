Well, for one thing, it looks like the breast plate is wrong. Shouldn't it go
all the way around the oil breather tube, all mine do. And the carb/alt thing.
I ran into that an couple of times and one of my solutions was to cut the neck
bracket off of a trashed center section and file it smooth. You then get
another carb gasket and bolt this between the carb and the center section
extending the height just enough to clear the alt. You may have to buy longer
carb studs. The other method was to buy all the used carbs I could find an get
lucky finding a 74-79 alt type.

I got around to taking a few pics for my questions. 1 question was
exactly what tin I had, since it didn't seem to fit properly. pics of
there are here:

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3115-8-0.shtml
http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3116-8-0.shtml

there is a major gap on the drivers side that leads me to believe I
don't quite have everything I need.

So while putting all the accessories on tonite I got the alternator
mounted then noticed that there was a problem. The carb accelerator
pump linkage is hitting the alternator body causing it not to open
fully. pics of the close proximity are here:

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3113-8-0.shtml

I'm not sure why it is hitting, but I'm gonna have to do something
about that, just wondering if anyone else that has installed an
alternator has seen something similar.

Last but not least the reason I had to get a new long block.

These pieces were once part of the case:

This is the case

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3119-8-0.shtml

pretty nasty. it really should have all those pieces in it :)

thanks for any insights into these issues.
