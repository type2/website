&lt;&lt; Dawn  from PLF sells a product that is supposedly the exact one used for
 that type of canvas. Ive got 2 gallons of it. Called &quot;Preservo&quot;. &gt;&gt;
Hi Wade,
Yup, that is the stuff we used!  The company still makes the same stuff, but 
they have dropped the Preservo name.  We can not remember the new name.  You 
will need at least three gallons to do the job properly if you have a SC.  
Wish we had used the silicon stuff instead.  Eric&amp;Barb
