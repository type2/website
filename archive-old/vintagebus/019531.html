when the speedo in my sunroof crapped out, i sent it to palo alto speedo to be repaired.  it cost a little more than $100... something like $130.  if i'd known that they'd not only fix it but also nearly restore it, i'd have sent the original '56 speedo instead of the '58 my sunroof is using.  the '58 speedo is very nice but when i sent it to palo alto speedo, it wasn't quite so shiny and bright on the back as when they returned it to me.  i've no regrets other than i'd rather have sent the original speedo.  i'll just wait until next time!
