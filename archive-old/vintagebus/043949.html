Is there a reputable manufacturer of reproduction side tents that I could
contact?  It's for a '66 Westy B42SO-42.  I suppose roof racks are best
found at swap meets.  But does someone know if the roof rack that came
with this model was mounted ahead of the pop top, or was it behind the pop
top roof section??
Thanks
later
