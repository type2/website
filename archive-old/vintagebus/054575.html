Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

Easiest way is to pop off the horn button and the nut holding on the wheel,
then squirt a little of you favorite WD40'ish lubricant down the key, then
heat up the pot metal hub of the wheel with a propane or MAPP gas torch.
Heat it up for about 30 seconds then bang on the bottom of the wheel with
both hands, one on either side.  After a few good whacks it should come off.
If not heat it up again and repeat.  This is the only way I have found to
get a wheel of without damaging it.  Obviously you have to be a little
carefull with the torch.

&gt;        You need what is called a clam shell or bearing splitter.  It is
&gt; basically two half circles that bolt together, these would bolt together
&gt; underneath the steering wheel where your turn signal switch is (you gotta
&gt; remove the switch).  When the two halves are bolted together, you can now
use
&gt; a two arm gear puller to pull the wheel off, plus if you feel the need to
&gt; help things along with a hammer, your banging  on the bearing splitter and
&gt; not the wheel.  I scored my bearing splitter at Harbor Freight.  It cost
&gt; about $29 and has treaded holes in the bearing splitter halves.  Included
in
&gt; the kit is treaded bolts for the bearing splitter halves and the puller,
plus
&gt; a few other things like claws for the puller.  Well, worth the cost, this
kit
&gt; has pretty much covered most of my puller needs.
&gt;                                                                Peace,
