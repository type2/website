&gt;There is a wire to the backside of the flywheel housing.  I can't tell
&gt;what it goes to (again... this is a '74 DP engine from a bug).

It's one of two things: either one of the fuel injection pieces, like
E&amp;B said, or one of the sensors for the central test socket that was
in later Bugs.  If it's a fuel injection part (more likely on a '75
and newer) it might be the thermo-time switch, but don't quote me on
that.  Otherwise I think it's a TDC sensor (sensing flywheel teeth)
for the central test socket.

On your Bus, it won't hook up to anything.  You might zip-tie up the
wire so it doesn't flop around and get caught or lay on something hot.
