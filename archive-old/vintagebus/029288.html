&gt; As far as the universal professed altruism that keeps on being posted...
&gt; I know for a fact that there have been multiple requests for help which
&gt; were refused to people who, while not part of the mailing lists or AIRS,
&gt; nevertheless got the info and called members for help.

This brings up the one and only time I helped someone via AIRS.  This
father/daughter team found me via the AIRS print out they stumbled across on
the web.  I helped them with out hesitation, but boy was my wife freaked!
Strange people calling in the middle of the night asking for me and knowing
more than she thought they should know.  My fault really, i should have
informed her that I'd put my self up on the list as a possible source of help
for travelers.

Thinking back on it though, I'd have someone else around (on my side) while I
was helping the next person that comes along.  Good to have eyes in the back
of your head sometimes.  I hate to be a pessimist, but it comes with driving
a bus and always being prepared ;-)

On the other hand, if anyone is that concerned, just remove yourself from the
site.

Steve
