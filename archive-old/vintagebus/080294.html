Yes, since you suggested it last time Fleetlines were topic
of discussion, I have started to collect VIN plate info. Not
too much to work on yet, but I've been contacting all the UK
Fleetline owners who post on thesamba_dot_com and ssvc forums
and asking them to send me the info, as well as asking all
the SA Fleetline drivers I know.
