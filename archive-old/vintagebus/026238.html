I agree with Thom. makes a BIG differennce in the final outcome.
There is also a neat trick you can use if you plan to get all new
rubber..and you are *certain* that there will be no body work or rust
repair under the window rubber.... take a razor blade and cut off nearly
all of the rubber on the outside of the bus. But leave the windows in.
This will make masking a piece of cake, will insure that no paint
oversprays into the bus, and will give you plenty of paint up under the
new rubber when it is in place. 

If you are painting the inside as well, or need to do any work on the
window area, just take the windows completely out. But the razor trick
is a good one if you are going to get a cheapo paint job and dont trust
Earl Scheibs masking abilities....

When you reinstall the windshields, consider using some of Eric and
Barbs roofing tar. Works great!

&gt; Absolutely!  If nothing else, it looks a LOT better if you paint *under*
&gt; the rubber and don't try to mask it.
&gt; 
&gt; It's quite easy to put new ones in.

&gt; &gt;hello all    hey  i have a question,    is it worth all the trouble sense i
&gt; &gt;am getting my bus painted to go ahead and get all new rubber around all the
&gt; &gt;windows even though none of them leak now, but they look pretty bad,   and
&gt; &gt;also, if i should replace the rubber, how difficult is it and are there any
&gt; &gt;hints on how to keep the job as easy and simple as possible.
