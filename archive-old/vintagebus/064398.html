Subject: Re: [VB] $100 reward for felts

Yeah, but if you keep up with Mr. Mayes' site, you will see, he has kept
EVERY VW he's ever bought. So buying another one will just cause him to have
to keep it, heh.  And if his wife is anything like mine can be, that's a
hard row to hoe.

&gt; I've been thinking...
&gt;
&gt; I think Mr. Mayes would be better off purchasing a rusty but all original
&gt; Single or Double Cab from which to remove parts from.  I have seen several
&gt; for sale since his search for original parts began and I have a feeling
&gt; he is getting close to, or may have surpassed, their asking prices.
