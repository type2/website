&lt;&lt; Now I've got to replace that home-made cardboard bushing :-) Is there 
supposed to be a bushing at the other end (rear) of the tube too? &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
Should only be the one plastic bushing on the front of the front end short 
shift rod.  On the rear long shift rod inside it's tube there are two plastic 
bushings in lots of grease which by now has probably turned into puddy.  Plus 
two rubber boots one on each end of the tube to keep out the sand/dust from 
prematurely wearing out these two bushings.  These rubber boots are now 
availible through Wolfburg West.  Of course there is also a bronze bushing in 
the nose of the tranny nose cone which also should have a rubber boot over 
for the same reason!
