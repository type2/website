Joe,

I will repsecfully disagree with not por15'ing the
brake drums.  I have a 73 Bettle that got the
treatment about 6 years ago and I have not had a
problem with overheating or warping.  They still look
great and not one bit of rust has infected them since
the application.  por15 makes high heat paint, and you
think it wouldn't do as well as some barbeque paint
from Wal Mart?  I did it to the rear drums of my 66
Crew, and as soon as I figure out what part number to
purchase (211 405 615B or C?), the fronts will get the
treatment as well.  I think the look of black drums
against white rims looks really good.

As for slopping it over everything, I agree with you. 
Make sure the surface is clean and invest in some
Metal Ready, it works great to help with the adhesion
and effectiveness of the job.  Putting por15 over
paint does noting except protect the paint from
rusting, not the body itself.

Just my opinion,

Paul
66 Crew (with por15 coated rear drums)
