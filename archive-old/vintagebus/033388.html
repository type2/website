Hi Cecil,
Doubt that.  If you can handle a paint brush properly.  Plus can you buy 5
gallons of it for $32.00?

 &lt;&lt;Won't melt in the hot sun, won't make the bus to stiff to drive in the
winter. &gt;&gt;
Actually tar will not melt either if appied thinly due to the fact that it
will dry also.  The Rhinoliner will not increase the thermal insulation value
of the bus which will keep in the heat during the winter and keep the heat out
during the summer.  Plus the Rhinoliner if it is just plastic or rubber will
become a green house for rust.  Please see the past post about this problem.
