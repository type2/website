Yes I checked the Archives.



My left rear wheel has grease or oil all over it and in the inside.  I took

it to a brake place (because I thought it was brake fluid) and the guy said

the leak was coming from the reduction box.  WHAT DO I DO NOW ?  Should I

even try to attempt this repair or let someone else do it ?  Keep in mind

I'm new at all this and just had a bad experience with the muffler thing....



Is there any chance it could be something simple ?

well, you can smell if it's gear oil.   Very simple.  
if you can reach through the brake drum with your pinky, feel in there- is it
wet with gear oil in there?   I can reach through the brake adjustment hole,
but evidently some people cant so use a tool if thats you.   Well, that mean
sthe axle tube seal is leaking.   

Seals are cheap ($3.50 or $5 per side), but you do have to take the drum and
brake shoes etc off to do this job.  And drain the oil out of the r. gear box
into a pan or it will drain itself out on you when you pul the seal holder
thing off the backing plate.  Well, you really should clean or replace your
shoes if they have oil on them.  

Aoother place it could leak is between the spring plate and the gear box, by
that round plug, but it wouldn't get in the brake area in the drum.  Eek-
scary.
