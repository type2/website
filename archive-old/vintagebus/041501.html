Curiously
So42's did they always come with a headbanger cabinet?
Interesting that in 68-69 so67s they changed to a rear cargo net and in 70
back to the headbanger. hmmm.
also why did they see the need to change the so-42 to so-67 designation
when the interiors are so similar yet from 69-70 even though they made a
radical change of net-&gt;cabinet and major change to the icebox unit they
didnt feel the same need to change #s?
Hmmmm........
