Nathan,

Pomona Swap meet  June 6th (I think)  at the Fairplex in Pomona CA.

Hang around a week and catch the best bus event of all time, the first
annual O.C.T.O/N.E.T.O. main event at the Pond in Anaheim on Sat. the
12th and the VW Classic the next day down in Irvine CA.

A good week to come to Cali!
