Well it's after midnight and I'm pretty darn tired so I'll make this short
'n' sweet.  My brothers helped me put in the new front glass in the bus and
it looks wonderful!  It's the tinted stuff from Ronnie and it's cool!

I also received a box of stuff from Ronnie that I ordered.  This allowed me
to put the rubber boot on the nosecone of the tranny.  I also installed the
rear brakes - complete on both sides.  Tomorrow I'll hopefully torque those
axle nuts down and then I can put the rearend back down on the tires.  I'm
wanting to get the bus rolling so I can take it over to the heated garage
this winter for the front axle rebuild.  That will be a major chore but I'll
be glad when it's done.

I gotta get to bed guys and gals - I'm burning the midnight oil.  Later...
