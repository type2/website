There is a painting process that can paint the whole side of a vehical off
of a photo, I saw this also at the SEMA show. When you see those delivery
vans with a whole mural on the side, it was probally done with this process.
It's a huge paint/grafics machine that moves down the side of a vehical and
paints the mural in one step, I could have bought a franchise for
250,000.00, would have to do a lot of buses for that price, I can find the
companie's name though, I would do my 1962 panel this way, but it's sold and
going to Utah, congradulations to another newbie bus owner, if anybody is in
the Salt Lake area pmail me and I will pass it on to the new owner of my old
(famous swap panel) panel.

First the dream, and now this.
Everett, I think you have a problem.
Do the graphics in vinyl, and seam them together like a billboard.
As far as the tatoos........youll look like the puzzle guy in all the tatoo 
magazines.

&lt;&lt;A couple weeks ago, I was thinking about how it would be cool to have a 
short-sleeve button-down shirt with that pattern. 100% cotton, of course.  
Hint, hint.

I was also wondering how I would paint my Bus with the pattern.

Hmmm, what if I tatooed my entire body like that, interesting...
