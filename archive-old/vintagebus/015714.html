&gt; John,
&gt; 
&gt; Another question.  Is 'Glasso'  an automative paint brand in
&gt; the US?  A product line by one of the companies?  Name doesn't
&gt; seem to ring a bell with any of the auto paint places here?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to hassle you again......
&gt;

Glasso Paint company is a German company and good automotive paint stores
should have some history on them and how to convert the orginal formulas to
American mixing colors.

Good Luck,

John

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
