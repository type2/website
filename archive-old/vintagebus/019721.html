door panel clips or screws....the PO of ,my bus bought some new door panels,
and installed them without any plastic backing...they immediately warped, and
also seemed to shrink.

He said the door panels came without any holes in them, and he just kind of
guessed as to their location. I have straightened them out a couple times, but
the holes he made never line up with the holes in the door. I am planning on
making some new door panels, possibly out of baltic birch, like the rest of
the cabinets in the bus...hopefully i can get the holes in the right spot...

probably no info here, just sharing what is going on with my '65 kombi...hey
it's friday.
