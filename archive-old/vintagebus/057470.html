Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Paint-Sikkens or Special Kolor

I'll buy that. Farbsonderkombination makes sense. And dropping the F makes sense too, since it's obvious that color is what the code is all about.

I got a good laugh out of the way David Mayes managed to twist this thread to fit his og bolt fetish. 8^)

And Robert, What thread was more boring than this one? No wait, don't remind me, it might take it a week to die down again. 8^) It's been fun digging in the minutia (it *is* minutia, right? Not manuer?) and I think we actually got somewhere with it this time.

&gt; I, too, spectulated in a NEATO Old Bus Review article several years ago
&gt; that SK came from Sonder and Kolor.  I was rebuffed on several fronts
&gt; until last year.  In communication with Dave Eccles, who is the author
&gt; of the &quot;Spec Guide&quot; which came out several years ago and author of the
&gt; new edition of the &quot;Spec Guide&quot; about to be released, he came back with
&gt; a reference to a 1963 dealer SO catalog which refers to Westfalia camper
&gt; two-tone color combinations as
&gt; 
&gt; Farbsonderkombination
&gt; 
&gt; and then lists Skxxxx followed by paint names.  If we're using logic,
&gt; Farb (color) Sonder (special) and Kombination (combination!) could be
&gt; FSK, but why use the &quot;F&quot; in a place on the M-Code plate designated for
&gt; color?  It would be redundant.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm with John Kyte, SonderKombination.
