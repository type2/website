Subject: Hazet tools
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

John Kyte just mentioned that my friend Jon Furst is a Hazet tool dealer, but 
he neglected to mention that the prices Jon charges are very resonable.  You 
can get almost any Hazet tool in the catalog for 25% off list plus UPS 
shipping from Albuquerque.  He seems to order quite often, I never have to 
wait long for my tools from him.  

His home number (which might be a better place to call him instead of at 
work) is 505-232-2582 and he said between the hours of 5 and 9 Mountain Time 
is the best time to catch him.
