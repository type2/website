Well today I got word that my bus rims are finished.  I haven't seen them
yet but my little brother went with my grandfather to go get them.  It used
to cost me $20 per rim but my total with tax for 5 rims this time was $78.38
for gloss white.  This is really darn cheap for powdercoating you know it?
So far I have this much dough in the rims:

15&quot; rims
------------
$50 to ship 4
$40 to ship and purchase one more rim
~$12 for clips
$30 for sandblasting
$79.00 for powdercoating

Now I just gotta get me some tires (Hello Ronnie!) :-)
