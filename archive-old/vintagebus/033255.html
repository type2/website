the guy in NC probbably isn't interested, as I live in W Washington state.
But I have a 2/3 length industrial roof rack FS.  It has been described to me
as the 60s type- lots of reinforcement s the length of the bus.  Anyway, it
was thrashed and repaired at some point, so it could be prettier.  Durn
sturdy though.   Get your clamps as turnbuckles at the hardware store.   I'm
wanting $130 for it.
