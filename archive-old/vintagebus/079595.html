How bout this...

Narrowed beam/airbag Mondays

Tire Size Tuesdays

Air Scoop Wednesdays

Thursday with Ferdi

Vintage Nazi Fridays

Synthetic Oil Saturdays

Nuts and Bolts with David Mayes on Sunday-interactive talk show

PS: Ricky----I don't care for those Taiwan hubcaps, too cheap, they tend to fall off all the time, easily dented and rust too easily.  Why do you think I pawned them off on you?

&gt; If not I propose opening up Thursdays for Porche discussions - call it
&gt; &quot;Thursday with Ferdinand&quot; or &quot;Thursdy with Ferdy&quot; for short; start some export
&gt; bashing about them going to England this time and remove Kabayo's definite
&gt; tire
&gt; size comparison chart on type2_dot_com; oh as for bus content did I tell everyone
&gt; I
&gt; drove it this weekend for 1500 miles. Ah the good times.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; p.s. No Taiwanini hubcaps for you, Beto! ;)
