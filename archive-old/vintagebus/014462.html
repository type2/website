Subject: operation panel van cab divider rebuild

Hey list,
With my bus in the body shop I am struggling to keep busy, Veedubically
speaking, so today I finally dug out the the panel van cab divider that Rennie
sold me last year. For a bit of history: in a no-fault situation (actually i
blame UPS) the divider was broken into 4 pieces plus miscellaneous bits were
lost when they snuck out a corner of the box.  So today I got a sheet of very
similar paneling and went at it.  I removed all the bits from the old panel-
window glass and seal and metal braces, set all the remaining pieces out on
the new panel and traced them down with a fine point sharpie.  I then took the
new panel to the sawhorses and went at it with the hand held jigsaw.  It
turned out really good.  Sanded down the braces and shot them with some grey
Rustoleum primer that looks really close to the original.  Now I am wishing
that the bus was here so that I could test fit the panel to see if it needs
any work around the edges before I spray it grey and reassemble it... It will
have to wait until monday when the shop is open..
Back to the westy rack,
Dan
