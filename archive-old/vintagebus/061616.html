&gt; I just replaced the windshield windows and seals on my 65 last week. Today
&gt; was the first day it rained and it wasn't very hard either. Well they 
&gt; leaked. The metal wasnt rusted through , no holes. I wire wheeled it with 
&gt; my angle grinder and the primed and sprayed it with some rustolem. It was a 
&gt; nice smooth finish. 

Hi Byran,
You have to use a sealant at least between the seal and body, even VW had a 
special sealant for this!  We use roofing tar there and between the seal and 
glass to prevent the nasty white haze from water attacking the laminated 
glass at the bottom edge.  Roofing tar is the only sealant we have found to 
last more than six months and has the added avdantages of repelling rust and 
would reseal if need be when it rewarms in the sunshine.  See the archives 
for &quot;windshield sealant&quot; and &quot;roofing tar&quot; for more info.
