&gt; for easier download for other VW enthusiast. (who already
&gt; have access to this material for free.) How does
&gt; this act of kindness constitute &quot;an act of theft&quot;.  Please explain.&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes,please. Do explain! I agree with Steve. Mike is just doing us ALL a
&gt; favor by making the info easier to get to so that more of us might benefit

 Bob Hoover's writings are Bob Hoover's property. Bob doesn't want them
zipped and distributed in this way. Therefore, don't do it! Why does
anyone need to explain? I hate it that every three weeks we need to
again explain copywrite law to the newbies.
 I for one am grateful for having the information available as Bob has
allowed, and it pisses me off that anyone needs to screw with it. Leave
it lie! If you keep mucking around with it, we will lose what is now
available.
