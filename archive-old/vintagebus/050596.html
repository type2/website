Subject: 67 master cylinder replacement

I have a 67 Single Cab with original dual circuit brake master cylinder.
After replacing my rubber brake lines to each wheel (two completely
clogged), and bleeding the system, I thought I was finished with my brakes
for a long time. A week ago I had to dynamite my brakes when some less aware
person pulled out in front of me. Shortly after I started noticing less and
less pedal untill it was dangerously close to the floor and would not pump
up. I carefully drove home, and after some troubleshooting found that the
front piston had no pressure at all when pedal was engaged. It was a day
after that when I found that a replacement master cylinder for that year
only was $126 from NAPA and $229 out of most adds in HVW. (not sure about
NAPA part). I had read several articles on exchanging the one of a kind 67
master cylinder for a 71-79. So.....

I went to my local Bow Wow and got a master cylinder and to a vintage place
and got the spacer and boot plus bolts, (see, I was listening). Since my
original reservior was OK, I figured that it was pretty much down hill from
there. The article on installing it was vague on hook up althought it did
describe the front line to the front bottom 45 degree downward pointing
fitting. That left one to assume that the rear lines go into the rear
downward facing 45 degree fitting and the two sender switches go into the
holes on the side.

My question is, does anyone have pictures of this installation? I am am also
interested in pictures of a Single Cab treasure chest tire rack so I can
weld me up one for myself.

Thanks alot, I also have pictures of my spring plate compression tool and
degree plate I
built to raise my truck back up to factory height.
