&gt; but I made it clear that the bus needed to be picked up within 30 
&gt; days after the sale.I also informed him that he will need to pay 
&gt; storage per day after that..but still nothing and he now owes over 
&gt; $500 in storage...what should I do next???-cameron

Well, if your notification was in writing, you might be able to file a
&quot;mechanics lien&quot; and regain ownership of the bus in lieu of the storage
fee.  That's what towing companies do with unclaimed cars.

Not very neighborly, but imposing on you for two months isn't exactly nice
either.
