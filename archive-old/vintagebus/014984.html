Subject: '58 wiring harness/master cylinder
Date: Sun, 30 Jan 2000 09:05:27 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;Hi , I am in need of a complete, good used wiring harness. Any leads or 
&gt;hints greatly appreciated.
&gt;Also has anyone replaced the single type 2 master brake cylinder with a 
&gt;larger dual circuit type 3 one? Or have any recommendations to upgrade 
&gt;this?
&gt;

Thanks Trevor
