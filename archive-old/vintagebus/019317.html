Is the outer edge square or peaked?  If it's square, they're 
repro; I don't think the CE repros with the correct profile
have been out long enough for a set to have found their way
into your garage that long ago.  Also, what logoing, if any,
is on the glass?  The wolfgang safaris have a HUGE annoying logo
on the lower outside corner.

&gt; How do I determine if they are &quot;real&quot; or aftermarket?  I didn't 
&gt; notice any markings on them at all...
