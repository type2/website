I use a combination of the plastic dip and fuel line for my rack. Just split the line on one side and it's a good fit over the feet, easily replaceable and very neat.
 BTW anyone know how much it would cost to have a full length rack repainted?  I slapped some rustoleum silver on it when I bought it, but the paint just isn't holding up out there in the weather.
Thanks,
Jon, 65 standard
