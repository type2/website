maybe there is a way to communicate to your neighbors that the price of 
living in a free society is sacrafice. that is to say in order to protect 
their right to do as they please, they must in turn learn to tolerate their 
fellow countrymen, their individuality and personal taste.  i for one cant 
stand people who grow beautifull lawns and then tell you that it is not for 
walking on. but then i cant exactly call the mayor because the lawn next to 
my house tends to make my bug look bad.
venting,venting...ahh much better now.
