Subject: Re: [VB] new bus, naming it

After having my 66 Splittie sitting in my driveway for 45 days and
starting a restoration just for the purpose of resale I continue to threw
$100.00 bills at it.
Seems an alternator is $100.00
Brakes are $100.00
Two tires are $100.00
Paint supplies are $100.00
Used seats are $100.00
Door seals are $100.00 the set.
CV Boots and one CV is $100.00
New carpets are $100.00
New Door Panels are $100.00
Rebuilt carbs are $100.00 each (Its got two).
Geed news the new 009 was just $49.00
So I appropriately named mine the 666 Bus.
Great engine though ............... &quot;Praise the lord&quot;.
Its a hoot to drive and I just wish I knew all the engine mods's done to
it.
From the looks of the mods it was a real fanatic (Perfectionist) that had
this van before me.
