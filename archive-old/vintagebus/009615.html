Archive searches reveal that 15&quot; tires have NOT had nearly the discussion of
14&quot; tires.  My results say that 6.40&quot; x 15&quot; is what is supposed to be stock.
According to several on the list, this comes out to be close to 195 / 75 /
15 tires.


Stephen,
I'm no tire expert but went through similar troubles last spring so I'll
just give you my experience on buying 15 inch tires.
Lots of people around here run either 205s or 215s.  I couldn't find LT in
205s.
When I went to buy my tires I had an original 6.40 spare.  (You could peel
the rubber off with your fingers)  I compared 205s and 215s with the
original.  The 205s were about and inch shorter and the 215s were about an
inch taller.  The problem is the widths.  The 205s I compared with the 215s
and both were the same width.  They are both about  7.5&quot; at the widest
point.  I ended up getting Yokohama SD-05 tires.  They are sort of a highway
tread with some fairly grabby edges. They are similar to the Geolander but a
little more agressive.   They have handled great.  I jam with the big boys
going up and down I-40 everyday with it and it has really straightened out
since I put heavier tires on it.
Those trucks scream by me at 75 and while I feel the blast, it's no problem
keeping the bus on track.  Used to have to grab the wheel whenever I saw a
trucker coming by.  The only problem I have is that my bus is a 58.  I had
to really jam to get the rear tires on.  I believe this problem is less
after 61(?) when the wheel openings were changed.  It is VERY hard to find a
skinny tire nowdays that isn't at least 7.00 like for a Chevy pickup.  There
are some Michelein tires available from Coker tire I think, but when I
checked they were about $750 for a set and so I did the best I could.  I
think I paid about $365 from Discount tire for a set of 4 with all the
warranty/rotation stuff last spring.  They had to order them from California
so it took about a week.

John
