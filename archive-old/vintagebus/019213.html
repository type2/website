The same!  But it isn't saved just yet ;-)  Did you get the chance to meet
George?  Man did he have some stories to tell about that bus...Dave Easterwood
even remembers him as being quite a motorhead.  He's been out of buses for 
quite some time now, when I used to keep in better touch with him he was trying
to put a bay Westy back on the road, but I don't know how that went or if it
went at all.
