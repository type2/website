Subject: My trouble filled trip to Omaha.

It's amazing that during my trip to BNNTA, I didn't have a breakdown other
than just over filling the crankcase on oil once.  Yesterday I headed up to
Omaha to see Rob and attend the OVWC meeting and about 3 miles from the
meeting place, I heard about 3 pop/bang noises and lost power.  I limped
into the parking lot of the meeting locale and decided to eat first and let
things cool down before commencing trouble shooting procedures.  I snuck out
of the club meeting to grab a little daylight and found out I had munched
the spring clip and washers for the #4 exhaust rockers.  An APB went out and
Phil Cram of Cram Foreign Auto Parts in Omaha came to the rescue.  Terry
Wolfe took me in the Westy to Phil's place and Phil graciously gave me a
couple of washers and a spring clip.  After returning to the parking lot and
monkeying around with the rocker assembly, I got it to run good again.
There was still a ticking noise which alerted RandyYates (owner of the Olds
455 powered Ghia) that something was wrong but since I had heard it before,
I attributed it to the chromoly pushrods.

I got up at 5:00 this morning and took back roads home.  About halfway home
around Cook, NE the engine was running absolutely great.  It actually ran
too cool - about 150 degrees at 65 mph and then all of a sudden - no power -
this time with no pops or bangs and sure enough, upon closer inspection, the
number 4 exhaust rocker spring broke.  I dug through my stash and found I
had left the ratio rockers in my stash so I moved all the stock rockers over
onto the ratio rocker bolted shaft.  I fired up the bus and not only was the
ticking noise gone, but the bus ran even better.

I've ordered a set of bolted rocker shafts from Phil in Omaha to help cure
the problem.  Thanks for reading...
