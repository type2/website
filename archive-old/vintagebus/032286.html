Hey Beto,

Well I've gotta say that you moved to the right part of the country if you
want a family type club. Strictly Vintage 2s is based in San Diego, but we
have a bunch of members up near you too. There'll be a big bunch of us at
Havasu, so we'll meet up there if not before.

Send me email if you want more info, or stop by our website at

Cheers,

Scott
