Just got back from another bus hunt. Yesterday I got the location of a
Desert stash that I have heard about but never found, so off I went to see
what's there. Upon arrival 20 miles down desert  roads, in the middle of
nowhere( kind of like Havasu) I arrived at the location, it's amazing how
people can live out in the middle of nowhere and he's been there over 20
years! Here's what I found 4 bay windows and 1 split, the split was a 64
walkthrough Sundial camper pretty well stripped but a lot of good stuff
left, it would have been very salvagable but the property owner moves
everthing around with a Bulldozer!! so you can imagine what things looked
like. One of the bays was half burried, the owner is building a house out of
tires and has been useing car bodies as filler around the structure, I had
to drive over a huge mound to get to were the split was and was informed
that I just drove over 30 plus VW bugs and buses, It's a pretty amazing
site. Anyway I asked him when he's moving stuff around if he would at least
put all the VW's in one area and when it cools down I will come back to
strip them, that would be better then seeing them become his East facing
wall.

ps. I now know why he asked if I had a 4 wheel drive vehical, I don't know
if I could have got one of my buses back there.
