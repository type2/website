So I went out today after sealing the fuel tank, thinking I'd make short work
of finding the necessary fittings for my remote oil filter mount, and some
hose too.

Ha ha ha.

I was only partially successful after a couple hours looking around.  Maybe
that's kinda sad, but I've never ever messed with an oil filter in my life :-)
I know, now, that I need 3/8&quot; threaded fittings, preferably with a 90 degree
elbow, with a nipple for a 1/2&quot; ID hose.  I thought I was squared away when I
got done at the hydraulics shop, but the fittings and hose were too small.
As a consolation prize I found the necessary fittings at Home Depot tonight, 
but they are straight.  I'm going to go back to the hydraulics place tommorrow
to return this other stuff and see if they can give me the 90 degree fittings
and hose that I want.  It's not their fault, I was exceptionally vague in my
description.  Being a newbie to this kind of thing, it looked ok to me...

Digging through the archives tonight (THANK YOU Matt, David, and the rest!) I
looked at several people's ideas of where to mount the filter.  I decided 
thanks to Adrian that I want to mount the filter upright, since I'm pretty
uptight about making a mess.  I'm really not sure where I want to actually
put it, though.  

Option one is a kind of hybrid I made up.  I get a piece of metal with four 
holes, mount this to the upright strut in the engine compartment (driver's)
and mount the filter to this.  I need two holes somewhere to route hoses.  I'd
like to have grommets for the hose openings, too, but am clueless as to where
to get such things.

Option two is &quot;somewhere&quot; under the bus.  The main gripe I have about this is
rocks and heat exchangers.  Sure I can shield the hose (this was discussed in
the archives) but I can avoid most of the problem entirely by putting the 
filter in the engine compartment.  Then there's rocks which might do bad 
things to the filter.  In the engine compartment, if a rod flies out of the
case it might get the filter, but then I have a little more to worry about :-)

I'm leaning towards putting it in the engine compartment, but I want to do
the best thing.  Does this seem reasonable?  If anybody has any suggestions
for better hose routing I'd love to hear it, what I'm planning seems fairly
safe but I've never done this before.
