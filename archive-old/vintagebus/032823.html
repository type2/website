Hi Don,
You did not mention how many miles you have on your engine, or how hot the 
outside air was then.  It might be that the weather was hot that day, or if 
you have less than 500 miles the engine is still breaking in and in town stop 
and go for 30 minutes here and there allows it to cool.  Instead of a steady 
high speed at high MPH making the new engine work harder pushing you through 
the atmosphere.  Remember it takes 4 times the HP to push you down the road 
at 60 MPH than at 30 MPH.  Most likely the hoses are not adding any real 
measurable amount of engine heat or cooling due to thier small outer surface 
area and probably made of a non-metalic insulating material.   Eric&amp;Barb
