That's a circlip.  Could be the one from the clutch cross shaft.

&gt;So I found a clip (I think that's what it's called) - one of those round

&gt;maybe 1 1/8 &quot;.  It looks like a washer with a little piece missing and two
&gt;little holes that the special pliers go into (I know this sounds stupid and
&gt;that I'm probably the only person on the list who doesn't know what this
&gt;thing is called.)  Anyway, I found it where I was recently working on
&gt;replaceing my clutch cable (I couldn't do it as simply as Muir says and had
&gt;to remove the whole clevis type deal) and removing my front shift rod lever
&gt;and shift rod etc..  Could this clip be from one of those things?
