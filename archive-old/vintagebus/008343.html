Hi Steve!
What a great post! You are SO right! I found my bus when I started
using a different bank because my old bank moved. I pulled out of the
drive-thru onto a back street, and there sat the '65 21-window that
was to be mine! :-) Now if that isn't karma!!!  Never would have
known it was there otherwise.  What luck! And now I am IN LOVE just
like your post said!!!  Thanks! It made me just want to walk out and
smile at my bus! And she smiled right back!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not an accident you decided to turn down that street on the
way
&gt;&gt;to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;instead of your normal route. You had a calling, a subliminal
&gt;&gt;compulsion to
&gt;&gt;&gt;choose that route.  Then you see it in the distance, a flicker of
&gt;&gt;color, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;unmistakable shape, your heart speeds up and your palms get all
&gt;&gt;sweaty. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;has been waiting for you. And the current owner knows it. They
sense
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;automatic connection the bus has for you. It is time to move on and
&gt;&gt;live
&gt;&gt;&gt;another life. There were good times but now the magic has gone and
&gt;&gt;rebirth
&gt;&gt;&gt;is the only way to find happiness. All busses and drivers have been
&gt;&gt;through
&gt;&gt;&gt;this.  It is the ritual, the right of passage.
