&gt;
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; You are probably going to be stuck with using a 165SR15 tire which is for
a
&gt; type 1 and really not wieght rated for the bus.  In other words you use it
as
&gt; a get to the next town and get the flat tire fixed/replaced.  Especially
&gt; since if you use differant sized tires on the rear axle for several
thousand
&gt; miles can cause damage to the differential!

I don't like running without the same tyres on - and over here(UK) it is
very rare to be more than 10 miles away from a tyre shop - so it wouldn't be
too far.

Don't know about in the USA, but over in Europe nowadays most cars come with
a spare that is around a 125 width on a 14 inch rim whereas the car normally
runs a 195 width tyre.  The spares come with a big sticker saying do not
drive at more than 35mph on them!  Not much use if you are on the freeway!

Thanks
Paul
