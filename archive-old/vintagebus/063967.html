Subject: RE: [VB] gas tank felts

To clarify that, I need the felts that go on the divider plates, not the
anti rattle felts for the straps that hold the gas tank down.

Hi All,

With all this info on gas tank dividers...

I'm willing to fork over $50... yes, you read that correctly, $50 for a nice
set of original felts from the gas tank dividers.  The things I'll do to
keep the double cab OG.

If you have them, either give them to Ronnie or send them directly to me.
I'm willing to trade for good stuff as well if that's a better enticement.
