Subject: Re: [VB] Are 67's supposed to have reverse lights??

Reverse lights started mid-year '67.  My '67 doesn't have reverse lights,
and it was produced on Dec. 5th.  I'm not sure when exactly they started,
but it was obviously sometime after that.

67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)


&gt; Are ALL 67 buses supposed to have reverse lights or
&gt; was it just a factory option?
&gt; I have recently picked up a bus with no title, VIN
&gt; numbers tell me it's a 67, but then someone else told
&gt; me that 67's have reverse lights, and this bus has none.
