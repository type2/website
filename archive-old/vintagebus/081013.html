basically, karl VS is one of the true wonders of the VW community -if 
you need a part, often karl simply asks for your address and SENDS it 
to you. i have been the grateful recipient at least twice. hopefully, 
the crappy vw keychain i sent him is at least partial payment.

the bay community decided to do him an impromptu honor.


he also is not to be trifled with in trivia contests... i hear he has 
the vw microfiche implanted in  his skull.
