&gt; &gt; hey all,
&gt; &gt; I recently picked up a 66 standard bus that I've
&gt; &gt; been working on, but it is
&gt; &gt; missing the &quot;black box&quot; that runs all of the brake
&gt; &gt; lights and everything.
&gt; &gt; Being, as I am, new to the world of VW's, I am
&gt; &gt; having a very hard time
&gt; &gt; locating a new one. I was also wondering if it is in
&gt; &gt; any way possible to
&gt; &gt; wire my bus without one&lt;&lt;
&gt;
