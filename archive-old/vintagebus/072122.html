&gt; hi all, my 1967 bus doesnt have keys, so i need to get them made, are the

Hi Josh,
The keys would be the same, but by now who knows which handle or if the 
ignition switch has been replaced with a part off an earlier or other type VW!!  
Best to remove all your door handles and the ignition switch (The last with the 
battery disconnected!!!!) and check all these parts for Key codes stamped in 
them.  Plus with these parts removed you can clean and lubricate them with 
graphite (Except the ignition switch!) and lube up the latch mechanisms with oil 
and grease.  1964-67 key pattern was a &quot;T&quot; and is stamped on all those parts 
followed by several numerals that the code for the pattern of cut of the key.  
Then take these parts to a local OLD locksmith and ask them if they can make a 
key.  If the locksmith says sure we can grind one up, RUN AWAY!  The only way 
to properly cut a key for a VW is with a special tool that vices the key in 
place and bites out chunks of the key to get you the proper key code.  This 
makes a huge differance on how well the key/s works!!!
  There are a couple of VW locksmith guys one in Texas is on this list and 
Gabriel is in California.
