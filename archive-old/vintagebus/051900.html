Subject: a carb rebuild question

Hi all-

I know that I am probably going to get some interesting responses, but here 
goes.

My brother Joe and I drive the vw's, and I have a 66 deluxe type II and he 
has a 68 bug. It has gotten cold here and his carb has been doing nasty 
things. we have narrowed it down to a carb rebuild.  The offending beast is a 
Solex 34-pict 3. Is the standard &quot;rebuild kit&quot; all we need, or are there some 
tricks that you folks could turn us on to? 

It seems to be sucking air somewhere, but finding that somewhere has been 
difficult. The regular old tune-it-up is not the answer.

Like I have written, I am sure that I will be rewarded with much teasing, but 
overall, this seems to be my best resource.

Any help is appreciated. 

Nicholas Miller
