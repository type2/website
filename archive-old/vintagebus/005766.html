&gt;-he is asking 4500 canadian.
&gt;too much or good buy??


Here's what you do Kenny - take that list of yours and write down how much
it's gonna cost to get the bus on the road and into the shape you want.  You
can get a rebuilt tranny for $460U.S. + but bus interiors are hard to find
(that is if you are missing all the seats.)  You can find seats - they're
out there but they cost a fortune.

Add up all your figures (don't cheat yourself - add in cost of shipping).

Then see how much your bus would end up costing you.

Compare this to what other buses are for sale keeping in mind any gas money
and lost time you would cause if you had to drive across the country to
pickup another in &quot;better&quot; shape.

If the body is rust free - it may very well be worth it as body work is the
#1 expense in fixing up any old vehicle.

Good Luck Kenny!
