Subject: Should I rebuild?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Crawled under the Binz this morning for some routine maintenance and notice 
that on the left side reduction box one of the attaching bolts was missing, 
one was sheared off, the top corner of the spring plate was broken off 
rendering yet another bolt useless, and the remaining bolt was loose...and 
the shock was broken.  Wow!  I guess I should consider myself lucky for not 
having a total failure yesterday while driving it.

Anyway, I am currently running small nut boxes and was planning an upgrade to 
big nut boxes soon anyway so it looks like a good time to go ahead and do 
this.  I have two sets of boxes from two different RWP (Ran when parked) 
field busses.  Question is should I just go ahead and put one of these in 
without a rebuild first and see what happens or go ahead and rebuild first.  
Normally I would rebuild first but I am a little concerned about the quality 
of the bearings available.  Seems like all bearings are made in China now.  
If the originals are good I would rather just leave them.  Any way to tell 
without taking the boxes apart?

Thanks,
Dan
