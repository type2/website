Subject: My Splitty Lives On!!
Date: Mon, 24 Aug 1998 12:08:54 PDT

Hi there everybody
For those of you who remember, about a month ago I was wobbling between 
replacing my bus and fixing it.  Well, it's fixed.  Woo-hoo!!
I called every mobile welder in my area (about 15 guys) and one was 
actually willing to weld up my bus.  So he did.  After I did the 
grinding.  Next time I'll wear gloves.  Ouch. 
$400 later, me and my crusty, rusty, barely holding together hippy bus 
are back on the road.
I ground off the old welds and the broken shock mount, and the welder 
fixed it all up.  I'm running upside down type 3 shocks (KYBs) and it 
rides great.  I'm so impressed I'm tempted to take a long trip and 
torture you all with a description of it :-)  
One small setback: my wiring (two fuses worth) was heating up like crazy 
on her maiden voyage, plus the turn signal switch started smoking (uh 
oh) so I had to pull over and find the problem: on the back side of the 
frame where the new shock mount was welded on, the wiring harness was 
stuck to the frame a little bit.  I pulled on it and felt it pop off 
(just a very tiny bit was stuck) but I fear further problems down the 
road.  Since I can't really reach in to where the problem is (was) I'm 
not sure what to do.  Probably I'll just Mickey Mouse something to keep 
the wiring from touching the frame again.  I know, I know, BAD Veedub 
owner, but at least I didn't ignore the hot wiring and drive on until it 
caught fire.  I never thought to check for wiring back there beforehand, 
so it's my own fault and I guess eventually I'll probably have to pull 
out all those wires and fix them, but for now everything seems OK.  
Touch wood.  

I took her to the great Canadian VW show yesterday, and although I 
didn't find any parts, there were some nice campers to check out, and a 
couple of kids wanted to buy my bus then and there.  Of course I 
declined, although I was so proud somebody else actually thought my bus 
was KEWL!  They even said they would have voted for me if I had entered 
the show (people's choice) but I'm just waiting for a show with a &quot;worst 
of&quot; category :-)

Crazy Chick with '66 Hippied-Out Rustiera Camper

I know it's not Friday, but I have to sneak in my email time when I can, 
so on the topic of crazy bus chicks:
Sure, I guess I must be crazy, since according to most people's 
perceptions, any female who ignores the advice of all the old, 
supposedly wise men in her life (eg. don't buy a VW, buy a Toyota) must 
be certifiable.  I must be crazy to drive around in this rusty old box 
of stripped bolts and mickey mouse &quot;improvements&quot; in spite of my 
father's offer to buy me a Toyota (god forbid).  But, were it not for my 
&quot;insanity&quot; my bus would be in a junkyard right now, as any sensible lady 
would have given up long ago.  All my friends think I'm nuts for laying 
out in the yard up to my elbows in CV grease, or replacing my axle on 
the side of a mountain road.  I guess it just takes a certain level of 
insanity to want a splitty in the first place!
