Subject: Re: [VB] VintageBus.Com - Opnion Wanted

&gt;I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of
&gt;bay-window
&gt;pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I
&gt;allow
&gt;the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail
&gt;from
&gt;my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I don't
&gt;support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for
&gt;bay-windows -
&gt;does one exist?


I say no problem.  Put 'em in a completely separate area though.

Just my opinion, that and $3799.98 could have you the '70 Beetle I missed
out on...

P.S.  In the interest of full disclosure:

I just bought a 95% complete and original 1970 deluxe Westy.
