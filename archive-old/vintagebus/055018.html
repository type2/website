Subject: sundial vs westy

I have a chance to pic up a 66 Sundial, and at risk of a flame war, can
anyone give me the pros &amp; cons of a Sundial vs a Westy. By that I mean is
the quality of the camp gear as good as a westy, do they hold their value,
that sort of thing. I know some of them were built on panel buses and this
one appears to be also, any pros or cons?
Thanks
Chuck
