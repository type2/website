HI Bus fanatics!

I got a call yesterday from my retired AutoShop teacher, his buddy's father
(90 years old)  has a barn full of &quot;OLD&quot; vw parts.  The old timer's buddy
just died and it was his stuff, he had been stashing it in the barn for
years, this was years ago.   Get the drift?   Stashed it in there in the
50's-60's!
   I have a Saturday morning appt to go see it and help myself.   They don't
want to have to pay anyone to come and haul it off.  I guess I can be of
service to them.
Why does this happen to me a couple of times a year?
Someday, when I have a website, I will post some of the barnyard/vw photos
that I have.
 I wonder how many trailer loads of Safaris and sunroof mechanism and middle
seats there will be?  What about those big ugly rear engine lids off those
old buses, worth hauling off?

I'll keep you posted.

If it is all broken crankshafts, I'll give you the address!
