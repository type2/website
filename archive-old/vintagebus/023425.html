I should be there too.  I am looking to find someone willing to do
restoration work on my 1963 Double Cab... if anyone has leads or can offer
assistance, I would greatly appreciate it.

  -- Front nose needs repair, I have located a doner front nose in Seattle
off a 1963 that is nearly perfect... but I'm not sure if my truck's nose is
bad enough to need a complete swap.  I want to hire out the whole job on
this, any leads on someone who can do this job appreciated.
  -- My engine lid hinge is broken internally on the right side and I'd love
to get that replaced
  -- Ultimately the whole truck needs blasted (rust removal) and painted...
but not planning that right away.

thanks.

I am going to make it for sure. The whole family is coming too. I will
be driving a primered 55 Single Cab. The single cab is for sale for
$2800 OBO and I don't want to drive it home. (Not that that is a
shameless plug or anything.)

We will also have the 60 Crew Cab back. I can't wait to drive it again
it has been too long. 



Come up and say Hi.
