I have come across some left over VW parts counter reference manuals that
were copied and found last PM.
There are 5 copies of the '67 print...covering '58 thru '67, 8 copies of
the '58 printing covering '54 thru'58 only.
Interested in one of them?
$40 includes S&amp;H for the '67 edition and $22 includes S&amp;H for the '58
edition.
later
