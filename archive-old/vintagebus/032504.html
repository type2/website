Hi Chuck,
Then are the latches pulling tighter or just loosening up when you undo them? 
 We found it extremely helpfull to pick up a cheapie stethoscope, remove the 
chest listening part.  Then use this to find the whistle/s location at 
highway speed while somone else is driving your VW.  We finally had to use 
foam tape cut down in several places on the rear of the wing glass.
