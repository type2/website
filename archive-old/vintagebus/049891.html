Subject: ANOTHER Cool item on Ebay

OK, you guys pooh-poohed the swivel seat I found on Ebay a couple of days
ago.  Here's another item *I've* never seen before, but no doubt many of
*you* have.  :-)  A dual generator stand!  Genuine Bosch.


http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=322700170&amp;r=0&amp;
t=0

Since there are bound to be a few of you running one of these on your bus
or schwimmenwagen, can you give some of the interesting details on setup?
What is the second generator?  Is it a special one?  How about the pulley?
Does any of the standard schrouding interfere with the v-belt?

Thanks!

Kabayo
