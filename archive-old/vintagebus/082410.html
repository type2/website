Subject: Re: [VB] Cibie H4 headlight conversion

Hi Bob,
Try:
_http://www.alfacybersite_dot_com/ACSCibhl.html_ 
(http://www.alfacybersite_dot_com/ACSCibhl.html) 
 
    We found with our 1963 Sc and 1960 walk thru panel  camper conversion 
that even going from the stock 50/55 Watt sealed beam bulbs to  55/60 Watt H-4s 
that we had to go through the entire wiring system checking for  ALL voltage 
drops from loose, corroded, connections.  Soldering  together the post-1960 
brass clips in each socket of the fuse box, or the  rivets on the forward side of 
pre-1961 fuse boxes, and soldering the riveted  connections (see type2_dot_com 
library for the headlight switch article we  helped Matt write up) in the 1955-67 
head light switch was a must.   The H-4s got a lot brighter and whiter, the 
headlight switch and wiring  around and in the fuse box went from finger (and 
wire) scorching hot to  just warm to the touch.  Plus all the other electrical 
items like signals,  wipers, etc. got brighter, and faster.
