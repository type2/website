Subject: Replacing your Jalousie window panes

I just completed making some replacement jalousie window panes and wanted to share.  The original safety glass was all getting bubbles in it that you cannot see through :(

First I went to Home Depot and got a sheet of quarter inch Plexiglas(really .22 inches and not .25), of course get a size that is right for how many panes you need to make.  Quarter inch plexi is not cheap, so do not go hog wild on the stuff...  I thought it was pricey for what it is anyway.  Okay now set yourself up on a workbench or saw horses and mark a template from the old window pane.  Now use a fine toothed circular saw or a fine toothed bayonet (reciprocating) saw and start cutting.  Use fast and accurate cuts otherwise the plexi will melt and you will have to recut the same line.  You will probably make more than one so reuse the original glass for another template and keep going,  if you use the plexi as a template they will end up too big because your line will get a little fatter each time.  Also keep the plexi steady and if it starts bouncing and clapping the table stop, otherwise it will shatter.  

You can sand the edges if you want, but I think a good cut is all that is necessary.

Fitting them in is really straight forward.  The original panes seem to be .2 inches thick so the plexi ones fit snug in the grooves when completed, be careful not to knock the rubber friction pads out when putting the plexis in.

Now you are ready for summer camping!....  Just remember now people can look in at you....  Drat now I need to make curtains and get the brake lights working to be road legal.

Enjoy,

PS.  I have been missing from the list for about a year so it is great to be back and hopefully will see a bunch of you all on some summer camping trips... Once I get some electrical issues resolved!  Arg.

PPS.  Some may also notice I ditched the 1969 Beetle for a 911 SC.  A darn good move in my opinion,  the 911 is fairly easy to work on also and much more fun to drive than the Beetle.
