Hi, all! Just wanted to relte a good experience with Kymco. My 
significant other ordered me a torquemeister for my birthday, along with 
a piece to be used on six volt engines. She never opened the package, 
just wrapped it and handed it to me. Lo and behold, when I opened it, no 
six volt piece.

I called Kymco, explained the situation to a gemtleman named Ronnie, and 
after two minutes, he decided to just send me a new piece. The one that 
didn't arrive might have gotten lost in their shipping department. He was 
very apologetic, very courteous, and a pleasure to del with.

Anyway, now I can get to work on the three engines in my garage, and go 
back to six volts on my 65 Deluxe!
