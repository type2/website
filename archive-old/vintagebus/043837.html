Howdy volks!

Anyone else tried the HPC coating treatment
on their heater boxes?  I just dropped mine 
off.  Regular machine shops around here don't
seem to hot tanks anymore (environmental costs),
so my original strategy was out the window.  

It's kind-of expensive, $150 for my 2 heaters,
but the examples of their work I saw look really
good.  http://www.hpcoatings_dot_com  if interested.

Before I spend even more huge amounts getting a
whole header done, I'd like to hear from you.
Gotta consider the pros and cons of stainless 
exhausts also.  

Hey Ronnie, did you bolt on one of those brit
ss headers yet?  Wonder what would be better,
a ceramic/aluminum stock exhaust, or that SS
number?

Guess I'm also wondering what other options there
are for stainless bus exhaust.
