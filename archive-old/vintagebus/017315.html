I've just ordered several of these; we'll see what I can come up with
once they get here.  Tomorrow, I'll be cleaning up all the contacts
and such, since I currently have this intermittent problem of not
getting any flashing when the head lights are on.  That's partly why I
was hoping to get away from depending on the flasher relay....

In any case, cleaning up all the relevant contacts (particularly those
in the switch, which are the most suspicious at this point) ought to
help things immensely.  The LEDs, when they're installed, will just be
an added bonus.
