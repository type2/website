Subject: South African VW Busses

Dear Sirs, 
I have scanned an aricle with photos from a Motormagazine on to stiffies in PDF format.

I wanted to add this to an email to yourselves and the list, so that you folks over there
in the States may enjoy our Busses.

You see, the one made since 1982 is now no longer made in the VW factory in Port
Elizabeth, we have now the front drive version which is utter rubbish here, as we are
towing our caravans about and Johannesburg, ZA is some 6000ft above sea level. Front wheel
drive and caravans do not go well together in desert like conditions, such as the Kalahari
and the little and great Karoo.

My question to yourselves is this: Why does my mail get rejected and comes back with some
language only a computerboffin would understand?

What I gathered is this: The attachment can not be accepted.
How then, can I let you have this quite nice ode to a beloved family vehicle?

Kindly let me know and maybe you'll give me some advice, of what to do.

In the meanwhile, kind regards from Michael Bernard in johannesburg, ZA
