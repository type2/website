&gt;&gt; Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
&gt;&gt; along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to.
&gt;
&gt;wow! that just gave me a great idea. in theory, you could take a heated rear
&gt;window out of a baywindow to replace the 63-67 rear window, couldn't you?

If the glass fits, this would work in theory.  That wire, however, is shown 
in the VW wiring diagram for my '64 as an 0.5 mm^2 (about 20 gauge) wire.
Fine for a few watts of audio, but not very good for several tens of watts
of heated window.  You could use that wire to switch a relay in the rear
of the bus that could supply the heated window via heavier gauge wires
directly from the battery.  That way you'd have a heated window and
fewer hassles with trying to string a wire from back to front.
