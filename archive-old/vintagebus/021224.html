Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Look at this photo please...

From what i understand the sump only has one
disadvantage and that is the reduction of ground
clearance. I do wish i had Thoms' &quot;problem&quot;, who
wouldn't want a westy hitch! The sump provides an
extra quart and a half and in an aircooled vw that
isn't a bad thing to have. I have one and a doghouse
set-up in my 65 Westfalia and have NEVER overheated my
bus!

&gt;   To each his own, but I honestly don't see any 
&gt; advantage and several drawbacks to using a deep
&gt; sump. 
&gt; Additional cooling would be negligble, just more
&gt; time to 
&gt; reach operating temps and to cool down.  
&gt;   Does it run hot? I noticed from the picture that
&gt; your 
&gt; barrels are missing the cool tin air
&gt; deflectors!...maybe 
&gt; the dpo was trying to solve overheating problems by 
&gt; adding the sump he saw in the kewl, sano rags. 
&gt;   Kinda of like cutting your head off to get rid of
&gt; a 
&gt; headache! Don't treat the symptom, fix the problem.
