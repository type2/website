If the puck's level and supported by the wheel at mid-span with equal weight
on either side of the wheel (generally how a trailer would be designed), it
would balance there. If there's slightly more weight toward the hitch (on
which it is supported), then all you would be lifting is that extra weight
(i.e. ~ 50 lbs). It could weigh two tons, and if supported at the center of
mass, all you would have to lift is the extra weight that is keeping it down
on the hitch.

Just an engineer's end-of-the-day Friday thought :-)

&gt;Pucks are so light, I don't know how heavy they are,
&gt;if u pick it up at the end of the puck, it's like only
&gt;50 lbs, Im sure u can tow it w/ a 36 hp motor (okrasa
&gt;that is =) )
