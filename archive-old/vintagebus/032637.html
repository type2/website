you never know.   and what &quot;really nice&quot; means to somebody from wisconsin
is probably not the same as someone from california, or florida, or
pennsylvania, or.... the problem with what i see in your email are the
words &quot;early camper&quot;, the dollar amount, and then the driving home part. 
hard to determine mechanical condition from a quick spin around the parking
lot (sorry, scott),  and alot of people want early campers, but you really
never know what will show up.  why not try octo, too, if you're coming this
way.  i don't think the classic is exactly the best place to be buying a
bus anyway, with the inflated pricing going on, but if you've got the time
and cash to fly out, may not be bad to at least check it out, just be sure
to get a return flight just in case.   also, as the saying goes, it's not
what you know, it's WHO you know, and i've often found busses through
people i just started talking to at shows, and there will definitely be
alot of bus people from around the country there.  that's how i got my
curent driver-a 61 westfalia-just started talking to a vendor at a show,
and he said those magic words--&quot;i've got this camper in my carport
and.......&quot;. couldn't sleep for days. i paid less than what you are wanting
to, but i had to go to north carolina with a motor, assemble most of it
before i could drive it, took a week.  but i got both tents, westy owner's
manual, child's cot, extra interior parts, some nos parts, and on top of
that a freshly painted, clean-to-begin-with westy hatchtop.
 i guess it really depends on how bad you want a bus/camper, your time/$$$
situation, if you're willing to go home empty handed or make a snap
decision 2000 miles from home, what you mean by &quot;really nice&quot;, or if you're
willing to wait to find the one of your dreams. i surely wouldn't sell mine
for 4k. 
 good luck, and if you get out here, look for me at octo, in my 61 westy,
shiny maroon/white, new mexico plates, probably the small tent set up, no
hubcaps.

&gt; What are the chances I could fly out to the Classic in Irvine this
weekend, 
&gt; find and buy an early camper ( to 1966) really nice shape and drive it
home 
&gt; to Wisconsin all for $5000 (4k for bus, 1k travel)?
