Hi Dre,
Engine oil, ozone from the generator, or even sulfuric acid fumes from the 
battery or a combination of these, just do that!  You can replace these 
brittle wires with new ones (Talk to &quot;No loose screw too small!&quot; David about 
sources he found.) or as we have done scavange wires out of wiring harnesses 
used in 1950s-60s-70s VWs.  We have been collecting boxes of old wiring 
harnesses from totally wrecked VWs and found that the wiring covered by the 
outer sheath is in new condtion.  All you have to do is to clip off the old 
wire ends you have solder and heat shrink on new/used wiring and crimp or 
solder on new all brass terminal ends.
