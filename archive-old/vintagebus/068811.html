Hi Don,
We do not remember your location, but Rancho seems to be the best from what 
we have heard.  So unless you can find a reliable tranny rebuilder in your 
area we would suggest them.  You might try contacting them through Ronnie of 
Old Volks Home of AZ.  Last we heard you might be able to get the Rancho 
rebuild at a slightly lower cost through him.
  Figure at least $500.00 for a quality rebuild of the center section, and 
$200.00+ for the eight RGB bearings.  To keep cost down remove your RGBs 
yourself and ship the center section to Rancho.  While the tranny center 
section is away you really should drill and tap the RGB mounting bolt holes 
to the swing plates deeper so you can install 40% longer new bolts to prevent 
stripping holes when torquing these down later.  We used to have at least one 
bolt hole strip with stock length bolt during each tranny installation 
otherwise!   Also you can have your axle tubes, RGBs and brake backing plates 
sand blasted and powdercoated.  When you get the tranny back install the axle 
tubes and RGBs with the new bearings and enjoy!
