They are opposite, the can style. Drove me nuts on a brandy new engine,
used to stock stuff, couldn't understand for life of me.

I've only done this with a pump not installed on engine, but I think it
should work either way. Cover an fitting with your finger and operate
the pump a few times. Remove finger. If you here a little &quot;pop&quot; of
vacuum being released, then you have identified the inlet. No &quot;pop&quot;? Try
the other fitting. Still no &quot;pop&quot;? Pump is bad, probably the check valve
flapper inside. Can't rebuild the Brazilian pump to my knowledge. Old
German two piece pump is a breeze to rebuild, kit is readily available.
Instead of a finger you could attach some clear tubing to the fitting
and drop the other end of tubing into a can of gas. See gas being drawn
up the tube? That's the inlet. I've never had to prime a pump, but I
could just be lucky because I have heard some references to it
somewhere.

&gt;   I installed a Brosol &quot;alternator style&quot; mechanical
&gt; fuel pump this weekend and can't figure out wich outlet
&gt; is &quot;from tank&quot; and which is &quot;to carb&quot;. I checked the
&gt; archive and idiot book w/ no luck.
&gt;   Old pump was in at the bottom out at top. This new one
&gt; says opposite on box I think (its in spanish). They look
&gt; the same, shouldn't they both work the same? I tried
&gt; running it both ways with no luck.
&gt;   Maybe it needed to be primed first? and how do i tell
&gt; how long the rod should be? My VW guy said the one I had
&gt; was too long but I don't know if this short style is too short and
&gt; causeing the problem (how do I tell, can i turn the motor over by hand

&gt; and measure how much it sticks up?)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
