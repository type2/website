&gt;I  was wondering if anyone knew if the wheelwells were modified at  any
&gt;time during production for my 67 bus?

It's not mentioned in  Doliwa or the Bentley manual.

&gt;It seems like mine are cut a little  higher up than most of the other
&gt;ones I see, but it does'nt look like  someone modified it.






That's what happens when you wash in hot wate rand  not  cold.
