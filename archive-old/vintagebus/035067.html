Yup, don't think those seats are worth much.  A friend of mine threw one 
away.  oh- the passenger side is the same as other years, just the drivers 
side is the one year dealie.

 &lt;&lt; From what Ive seen 62 is a 1 year only walkthrough seat?? Kerry in New
  Mexico had these in his DD and they had a weird bracket that mounted to the
  side of the pedestal for the seat to slide on (drivers side). Do you have
  this bracket also?

 Barry has an extra set of these 62 front seats. You can see a picture of the 
 driver seat in my 62 DD WT panel by going to &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/busrock/index.html&quot;&gt;1962 double door 
 model215-080 walkthru panel&lt;/A&gt; 
 I would think the pair would be worth $ 40.00-80.00  bucks if you can find 
 someone that needs them.  Ronnie, You better stop by and see me when you pit 
 stop in NM with the side loader (cool looking bus) or I'll kick your ass.
