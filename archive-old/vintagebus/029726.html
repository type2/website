&gt;I have a question.I bartered a bus part with a gentleman on this list.
the deal went as follows.
&lt;big snip&gt;
&gt;Should there be NO time limit for someone to voice his regrets ????
&gt;
It sounds like he wanted to check his side of the deal first, thus the 2
week delay in sending your part out.  If he felt he got a bad deal, he should
have sent your part back to you ASAP.

Sounds like a person not to do business with.

I think that complaints against other listees should be kept off list. 
If you are thinking about doing a deal, I say send a note a note to the
list asking for feedback about person xxx.

I never do any deal over ~$100 without calling the person on the phone and
seeing how they sound.
