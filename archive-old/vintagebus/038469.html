Hi,

EveryBus 2000 is coming up on April 14,15,16 in Greensboro North Carolina.
Last year about 60 buses showed up and this year promises to be as large if
not bigger.  The people are demanding T-shirts but I am a talentless hack.
Is there anyone out there who is going to attend that would like to be
incharge of the T-shirt concession? You design, you produce, you front the
cash and you turn the profit. I would like to hear ideas from people who are
truly interested in doing this.

Stickers might also be cool.

 Remeber, I am a no talent bum and need your artistic help:)
