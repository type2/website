Hello Everyone!

    Does anyone know of a good place to get replacement front windshields.
The first rain has come and my windows are in need of replacement. I also
have some rust repair to do and this is becoming more of a daily driver for
me. Also I have replaced the rubber seals between the window frame and the
front doors but they still let water onto the door panels what is the easy
fix on this if anyone has had this problem.

The Rain is attacking from all directions on the Cali Central Coast.
Sincerely
Eric
