Hi Joe,
As long as the #1 mark on the rim of the distributor is in line with the #1 
spark plug at the same time.  Otherwise you might be using the #3 section of 
the distributor for #1 cylinder which will knock your timing off several 
degrees and probably cause heat damage to your engine.   Eric&amp;Barb
