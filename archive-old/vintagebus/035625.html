&gt; I haven't heard of a &quot;Go-Go&quot; bar in at least 30 years, Jim.  Boy are you

&gt;  blending in.  It's hard (I imagine ;)) to blend in at a &quot;t:tty bar parking 
&gt;  lot in a primer Double Cab or a RFH.

whatshisname in Phoenix (no not Everett) is (was?) a bouncer at such a bar- I 
had the impression he drove his 51 bd to work.
