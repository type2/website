Subject: Building a Work-horse
Message-Id: &lt;199905300103.VAA04816_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

I'm working on all this tin for an engine . .

Awkward in the least . . .

I don't have a work table per se, and if I did, it
would be covered with important projects that can't 
be moved . . .

After a particular bad day with the tin, I decided
to build a work-horse . . .

This is a stocky saw horse with short legs and a 
6 inch wide top . . a 2X6 actually . .

I have seen the top up to 12&quot; but it's too wide for
my taste . . .

I want something I can stand on the end, drop an engine
on . . .

The top is two 2X6's glued together . . the legs are 
all 2X4's some 16&quot; long . . the whole thing is about
19&quot; high . . the height of my knee . .

I want to be able to walk up to this thing with a load,
rest my knees on the horse and then stand up . .

I also want to sit on the end and work on a part on the 
other end . .

Above all  . . I want to be able to hammer on it . . :-)

The hammering spec. meant I had to lap-joint some then glue 
and screw everything . .  :-)

A lap-joint is where you cut half-way thru, and then clear 
that, do the same on the mating part and the two lap into
each other . . the benefit is a joint 1-1/2 times as long 
as a straight bond . . you  also have a joint that can 
stand loads in both planes  of loading . . 

Ultimately, I think lag bolts thru-out but I just wood glued 
and screwed down with # 6 screws . .

I made this thing waist high . . 33&quot; in my case . .
Once again, I want to stand this on it's end, swing up 
on the end and work with confidence  . .

Thru the top of this double thick 2X6's, I want to drill
some holes for dowel stops . . a pattern for my vise . .
the small 6 pound anvil . . 

At this point I already decided to build a second one, the
same height etc but only about 15&quot; long(cubit) . .

This one will go in the house for when I'm puttering . .
Save the table a lot of grief . .  :-)

Put those same hole patterns in this short top . .

I didn't want to do these lap-joints . . I'm lazy . .

My grand-father had a house full of hand made furniture.

Everything was wood doweled or &quot;mortise and tenon&quot; . .

The mortise and tenon stuff was really &quot;cool&quot; . .

A mortise is a square hole thru some board . . .

The tenon is a square tongue that goes into the square
hole . .

All the legs and chair-backs etc. were &quot;M&amp;T'd . . 

What was so cool was the tenon was long  enough that
a second mortise hole was cut in the tenon where it 
came thru . . and a wooden wedge was driven into it,
pulling the tenon on the leg into the frame as hard
as you could ask for . . .

You want to tighten that chair-back or leg . . take 
your shoe off and hit that wedge there . . :-)

Tho it has only occurred to me, all the furniture 
could be broken down into flat packs in just a few
minutes if you were a mind to move . . .

So OK, I guess I can cut a few lap-joints with-out
falling apart . .

I'm haunted by spooks . .  :-)
