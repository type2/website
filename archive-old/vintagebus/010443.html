Hey Volks

Here's the latest communication from Espen Svensen, the young Norwegian who,
with a South African, Wernher, is travelling from Cape Agulhas to North Cape
in Mabel, a basically stock 1959 Kombi. They're now in Aswan in Sudan,
considerably behind schedule, but past the worst. Now it's just Egypt (good
roads) and Europe. Cape Agulhas, in South Africa, is Africa's southernmost
point, while North Cape, in Norway, is the northernmost point in Europe.

&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;This is just to inform you guys that Wernher is now a computer-freak.
&gt;We are in Aswan for the time being, and are soon going to Cairo. The trip
so
&gt;far has been with minor problems, such as tyre-explotions in northern
Kenya,
&gt;engine out because of valve burn in Ethiopia and some small electric probs
&gt;that we haven't figured out jet (but we will).
&gt;We are very sorry for not sending updates, but Espen's mind has been sort
of
&gt;....... lately, just can't find inspiration to write. We will write a trip
&gt;report, but you might have to wait a while still.
&gt;
&gt;Wernher's E-mail address is: vw59beetle_at_hotmail_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;See you all later
