I just went through removing the 'blankets' from my pipes. Most definately
a messy bad experience, mask required. over the years it totally turned to
crusty free flying dust held in only by the crusty old vinyl or whatever
it was making up the outer skin. 

The simple act of opening and pulling
them off made most of the immediate area a white out of asbestos dust.

I also lost an uncle this way. Lung cancer because of asbestosis and
silicosis. He used to strip old buildings on a work crew w/o masks of any
kind.

&gt; &quot;second point i would be willing to bet thtat the original insulation is asbestos containing (i.e. carcinogenic)- don't want to breathing that stuff in&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Since the insulation is on the outside of the pipe, how would you be breathing it?
