My Dealer VW parts book lists center brake light up to chas # 351735
which falls somewhere at end of 57 early 58. My 58 Binz chas # 343475
has a center b/l and after sanding decklid it is the original ivory
paint as rest of truck. It does have the high taillights and there was
on wiring that i can find to the center b/l only for the lin. light.

not sure of that meaning of the last line.
 .. .  . .
My theory it that VW used up what was left over at end of each model
year and put on next years buses until supply ran out. My binz also has
an earier body number ( # 317249 ) so that could have something to do
with it.

the change at 351 736 (intermittantly) and 357 388 (standard) was April/May
1958 and refers to the change from the flat decklid t o the decklid with the
bulge over the liscence plate.    

The flat decklid was adopted a year earlier on 5th April at ch# 246 964.    

please note:   a flat decklid is more unusual than a brakelight decklid

Neither are at model years.  They are just whenever.  there are too many
changes at non model year times for me to really think that the model year is
too meaningful.    they just were constant making changes here and there, not
saving them up for the next model year.     It is extremely unlikely that a 58
would have come with a brakelight decklid.   The VIN you quoted indicates it
would have more likely come with a flat decklid.    

body numbers tend to be closish to the Vin, but on more unusual models (23
windows, probably binzes) the difference is larger,
