I'm looking for a rebuilt 1600dp longblock for my '67 Westy. Has anybody had
any luck with Fast German Auto? They mostly deal with pancakes and Vanagons,
but their rebuilds look prety decent (new pistons, heads...).  Any others
worth looking into? Personal experiences? I don't  think my engine will make
the long trip from PA to TX, and won't have enough time for an engine
rebuild.
Thanks in advance for any and all responses.

Jim
'67  Westy
