&gt;Does anyone know of a source for wheel bearings for
&gt;single wheel trailer wheels? (2&quot; hubs) 

Take the ones you have out and take them to your FLAPS on a slow day.
They can probably fix you up with some that will work.  Just have them
look in their paper bearing catalog - the trailer won't be listed in
their computer.

Don't be shy about opening the box they give you and comparing new to
old right there at the counter.  I was trying to do the wheel bearings
on a 2-wheel trailer and bought a prepackaged set of &quot;standard&quot; 1.25&quot;
wheel bearings that wouldn't fit over the spindle.  I tried a different
brand - same result.  Finally I went up to the counter and the guy
looked in the catalog and came up with a bearing that had a chamfered
and slightly larger ID that exactly matched my old ones.
