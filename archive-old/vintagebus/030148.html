&gt; My question to the list is this:
&gt; On a Kombi grey hardboard door panel, how is the edge of the door panel finished off at the pocket opening?

Robert,

I just climbed up into the attic to take a look at the set of DC door panels that I have saved for the very purpose.

The edges are rough.

1. Make the pocket
2. cut the hole in the door panel
3. Rivet the pocket to the door panel
4. you're done

Scott
