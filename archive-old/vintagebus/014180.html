68 and 69 front beam is a direct bolt up. There were some changes made in
1970 models and they may not bolt up. As for disc brakes, 1971, 1972 and
maybe early 1973 models had a smaller caliper and pad setup and although the
pads are cheap enough for the short time they seem to last the calipers are
a bit pricer and harder to find. I have not replaced the rotors on the '72
but I am betting that they are not cheap either.

Not sure what kinda front end problems you are having but it might be better
to set straight the correct beam, steering  and braking mechanism. I have
driven a coupla spilts that had wondrful steering and braking. I hope to get
mine in there soon:)
