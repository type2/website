I have heard mixed things about the new Mexican engines.  One guy I know
likes them and I just heard a horror story about a bad batch that leaked
and had to be returned for warranty.  Anyone on the list have actual or
very immediate experience with them?  Of special interest are the
turn-key engines.

Last month they ran a small ad in Hot VWs; maybe we can cover this now
and not repeat for a while.

Thanks,

Mike
