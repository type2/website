Last I checked, DBH didn't have the doglegs, cargo floors, jack points, and a
good amount of what they list on their sales sheets.  Maybe they do now but I
can't get ahold of them... I really want the Schofield panels and I hope that
things will work out (and that Alan's health improves!).  But as of now, we
have just been able to get the cab floors, inner and outer rockers, outer
panel behind front bumper, and the outriggers.  If Mary and Clay could maybe
forward some revised office hours to Thom for the DBH page he hosts then it
would be a lot better. Getting that answering machine during posted office
hours just isn't doing their business any good...
