Subject: Re: [VB] panel for $1.00

&gt; A '57 panel in San Francisco will go to the crusher unless somebody
&gt; takes it for one dollar. Good for sheet metal parts-- a shell only. Nose
&gt; has already been taken. Registered (non-op) and owner has all paper
&gt; work. If you need [most of] roof, corners, sides, etc., this is could be
&gt; what you are looking for. For info call Lloyd at 415-753-0180. You would
&gt; need a flatbed to haul it.

There is money even in shells.  If you take a weekend of your time and
sawzall parts off the bus, you can ebay/sell this stuff for bucks - even
donate it to the needy.  I'm slowly getting things set up around here so
that I can take rusted out shells of bugs and buses and part them out to
make some dough.    Someone should jump on this and go for it.  I would.
