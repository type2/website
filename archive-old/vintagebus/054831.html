&gt; On my recent Mexican 1600 DP I just used the old fuel pump from my 1500 (as
&gt; well as my old generator, voltage regulator, and dizzy).  By the way, I love
&gt; it...it is running great.

&gt; &gt; I have been told that the Mexican engines also use a different selection
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; parts for the Oil Pump, fuel pump etc..  True? False? Sometimes?

Oil pump outlet hole is different as I recall.  Fuel pump is not
different.  Stock one works fine.
