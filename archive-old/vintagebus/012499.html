This story  cannot let our hero leave Clearwater with out some free
plugs.
Kenny's VW inTarpon Springs gave our hero a couple of free hubcaps and
some much needed, un-heeded advise; torque your heads before you go. And
Mahalo to that little repair shop (name withheld) in Largo for the help.
63mph to some long forgotten berg to drink hot Chocolate and catch some
ZZZZ. He woke up a couple hours latter to florida frost on the split
screen (paradise... in a pigs eye)
he took the shore route to the pan handle and the bus sputtered up a lil
ole hill and coasted down to a FLAPS manned by my other brother Darrel.
Our hero procured another fuel filter and some poor man's carb cleaner.
&quot;What year is it ? that's an old one etc.&quot; from the locals going in and
out of the FLAPS. While he wielded the screwdriver with as much ablomb as
he could muster. jets out, count  the turns in and then remove. Squirt in
the float bowl vent tube and the jet pukas. Replace the clear and now
black disposable fuel filter.
Was our Hero thinking clearly?
Peer review come on...

The road is a tattle tale tell tale to all . If you think wrongly,  and
you think you have her beat, she'll find you out and drag you to her side
where you'll stay like a bad blind date. you just cant wait to move on.

 there is a lot of talk about the venerable can distributor (Dizzy?) but
what would happen if the thing should happen to go. how about power on a
hill?

Before we can finnish this we have to say  what happened to our hero
before and in between.

His power dropped about 5 hours after the chocolate ZZZ stop. he pulled
into a un-FLAPS in panama beach, the worst kind have tow trucks and a
shop out back, and backed out fast when he saw the prices.
This culminated to a sunset to dark head tightening and valve adjusting
session in he sand lot next door. The boys from the UFLAPS lurked like a
bunch of vultures on the curb their cigarettes glowing in the dark. The
only bus nut amongst them had a tow call to go to New Orleans.
He must have looked a fright with the sand burrs in his hair and grease
&gt;from head to toe.
The woman in the 24hr stop and rob next door showed him the cheap
flashlight batteries with out his asking; was it the bus or his overalls?
(Oh for the white LED wind up radio....) the nuts on the drivers side
head were loose.
 Back on the road with out the benefit of a CR tester  (the readings on a
little push in gauge proved to be 150psi all the way around when he found
a FLAPS with a  more reasonably priced gauge)

&gt;from there on his power was still down on acceleration and hills. After
he limped into the next Auto zone in  he procured some more tools and
aked were the local Air cooled mechanic was (there's one in every town)
What would you say said mechanic (the one with the dayglow psycodellic
bus out frount) said?

right!  put in a 009.
