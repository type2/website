You need a single cab with a bashed front end but a usable bed, then you
could make a &quot;Lassley&quot; (sucessor to the binz)

Heck, why not split it - put the pickup bed in the middle of the busm with
the extra cab section at the end; then you could put the kids &amp; wife back
there and never have to listen to 'em!

Or, how about a single-single cab, like the one on Everett's site
somewhere: they removed 1/2 of the cab, and extended the bed forard.  Carry
12' lumber without it hanging over!

Or make a full-size quad-cab - just tak the entire SC bed onto the back of
the &quot;double cab&quot; section.  Kyle will be your friend for life! (well, you'd
have to put a V8 in it...)

&gt;I have my old 66 13 window deluxe (rusty special) sitting out on the back
&gt;porch and I've actually envisioned it as a DC.  Right now I'm just pipe
&gt;dreaming and thinking of various alternatives to getting a double cab
&gt;(remember - on a budget!!!).  I think making a DC is a neat idea but I hate
&gt;conversions where it looks like Jethro and the boys drug out there
&gt;arcwelders and had a good time.
&gt;
&gt;So I ask, does it sound feasible to look for a DC with a decent rear end but
&gt;maybe a smashed up and totaled out front end?  Then take the front of my 66
&gt;walk-thru and cut the whole bus in half, merging it with the DC bed?  The
&gt;only mod required then would be to put a back on the cab or do as I have
&gt;seen done with a baywindow, just weld the hatch area in place so you still
&gt;have a hatch that opens up into the bed area.
&gt;
&gt;Just an idea - it sounds like it would be fun but yes,a lot of work.  Can
&gt;you say spools of welding wire? :-)
