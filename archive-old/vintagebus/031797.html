A couple days ago I got a call from a gentleman from Mass. who was in
Colorado with a 65 DD panel on a trailer for sale. He asked me if I wanted
it, but being short on fundage, I had to pass. I gave him the phone numbers
of a couple people  in the area who might be interested and low and behold
he just drove up with the bus on the trailer. It seems he might have struck
a deal with a fellow busser here in town and here it might stay. The
interesting thing was that this bus came from Az. and is a rust free (very
dry) double door panel, with a fresh paint job. All it needs is new rubber,
tires an engine and it's a done bus. So we'll see how the story plays out,
that will be 5 DD in Havasu now, see them all at BBB V in a couple weeks.

On another note another fellow came in today and asked if I wanted a bunch
of 6 volt parts and of course I said sure. A few hours latter a beautiful 67
Sundial camper pulls up to the shop and out comes this guy with a bucket
full of parts, heck with the parts, I wanted to see the bus. It seems this
fellow  moved to town and has this original Sundial camper, been repainted
and had chrome overrider bumpers, but it's the camper section that blows my
mind, 100% all original, except the curtains his grandma made.

gotta go, just about done redoing (driver status) a 65 (bug) rag top (out of
a earlier bug) for my wife
