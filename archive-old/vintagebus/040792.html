Lots of great new stuff happening that I need to let you know about...


NEW ILLUSTRATED PARTS CATALOG:
I'm really excited about this. Many people have been asking me to do it for
years.  Yes, there's the website, but a nicely indexed and illustrated
catalog can be easier to use (particularly when you're not near a computer
:-). What an incredibly huge job this was!  I've never worked so hard on
anything in my life, and I'm a hard worker.  Lots of all-nighters downstairs
on the computer while Evon and Haley slept.  Still, I think it was almost
worth it.  It's not perfect - I've already discovered a handful of typos and
other relatively minor flaws that stand out like neon to me, but probably
won't matter to anyone else - but it's a decent first effort if I do say so
myself. While the website still lists more products, the catalog goes into
more detail on what it does cover, such as exhaust diagrams, shift linkage
diagrams, cooling system diagrams, sheet metal and body rubber, air
conditioning parts, etc.  And I find it faster than the website for looking
things up quickly.  I think you'll also find it a very useful reference
particularly since virtually all of the part numbers used are actual VW part
numbers.  While in the past, my website has catered more toward '68-79 bus
owners, in the catalog I have made a real effort to offer more splitty
stuff. There are body panel and rubber diagrams, and more splitty parts in
general - if not for the barndoors then at least for the later splitties -
and still at lower prices than virtually anyone else.
The catalog is $1.00 if you add it to any parts order.  (A few oil filters,
tune up parts, whatever).  Otherwise, sent separately, it's $3.00 but comes
with a $5.00 off coupon toward your next purchase, so you actually come out
ahead $2.00 if you place an order from it.  If you're placing an order via
the internet, you can add it to your order for a buck when you check out.
(There's an option there for it.)  Or you can request it when placing a
phone order. To order it by itself, you can either send $3 by mail (4801
Gravel Pike, Perkiomenville PA 18074), or call with a credit card number.
I know some people may not understand why they should pay for a catalog when
Motorworks etc. mail them out for free.  Nothing is  free. Those who offer
&quot;free&quot; catalogs are simply incorporating the cost of the catalogs into their
parts prices. I will NOT raise my prices to fund this catalog. You will
continue to pay the cut-rate prices I always offer, plus a buck if you want
a catalog.

TOLL FREE NUMBER:
It's 1-888-819-DEPOT.  This starts on TUESDAY.  Please try go easy on us
Monday because we are still backed up from Friday!  This number is
_strictly_ for ordering BY PART NUMBER.  The people I'm hiring to answer
this number do NOT know how to look up parts, answer questions about parts,
etc.  They are simply phone operators; they are there to take your order,
and that's it.  Again, this goes back to keeping my prices low.  It costs me
money to give you a toll free number (about 7 cents a minute every time you
call.)  It also costs me money to train/pay people to look up part numbers
and answer questions.  I can afford to do either, but not both (unless I
raise my prices, which I refuse to do).  So it's your choice which service
to avail yourself of. If you can do the lookup work, you get to call on my
dime. Look at my website or print catalog (suggested), look at a Motorworks
catalog, check with the local dealer, read the number off your old part, I
don't care.  On the other hand, if you need customer service, part number
lookups, answers to questions, checking on orders, etc., the regular number
(215-234-VWVW) or sales_at_busdepot_dot_com will continue to reach people who can
do this, just as before. As to why it's an &quot;either/or&quot; option, we're back to
the &quot;nothing is free&quot; theme.  My goal is to keep my prices as low as I
possibly can, without sacrificing parts quality, and while maintaining
decent customer service.  This is what it takes to do that.  Anything more
would raise my prices.  Note: please be a little understanding if you call
over the next week or two, since we do have some new people answering the
toll free number (and are also short two people all next week).  Gradually
they will be faster and better at it, and hopefully there will be more of
them.

LIST MEMBER DISCOUNT
Until now, I've basically handled list member discounts personally, looking
at each invoice and taking a buck off here, five bucks off there, depending
on whether the items you ordered were profitable to begin with. Problem is,
when I wasn't in, no one got much of a discount, which wasn't fair to people
who happened to call when I was gone.  And also, the guy who just by luck
happened to order all low-margin parts didn't much like being told nothing
qualified for a discount. So I'm going to average it out from here on in.
The discount is 5% off the top, on any order over $50.  This roughly offsets
the shipping cost on most orders, so you can look at it as pretty much
getting free shipping on almost anything you buy.  Given that my prices
before the discount tend to be a good 10-20% cheaper than anyone else's to
begin with, I think you'll find this hard to beat.  Engines, transmissions,
special order or made-to-order items (i.e. carpet/upholstery/curtains),
items that we have to buy from VW themselves, Specials/Bargain Page items,
or items covered by other offers/promotions are excluded, because we don't
make much on that stuff to begin with. Of course, the discount does not
apply to shipping charges or core deposits.  Also, I will continue to post
special offers to the lists that are exclusively for list members, as I
always have.  Note: You must SPECIFICALLY request this discount when placing
your order.  The website shopping cart will not calculate it, but if you
mention it in the &quot;comments&quot; section we'll manually deduct it prior to
shipping.

Sorry for the long e-mail.  I was going to break it into separate e-mails by
subject, but figured that one big one would be easier to delete.  :-)
