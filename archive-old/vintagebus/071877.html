Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

If big oil lines are bad, and small oil lines are better, then why not run
1/4&quot; lines, or better yet, 1/8&quot; lines.  ;-)

Like George said, if you push X amount of oil into one end of the oil line,
then the exact same amount of oil will come out the other side. Oil line
size does NOT change this.

Now, the speed at which the oil travels through the oil line will change
with oil line size, but, regardless of oil line size, once the oil line taps
back into the main galley, the oil speed is the same.

If an engine is suffering from low oil pressure, it is, without a doubt, not
from an oil line being too large. Low oil pressure is a result from worn
main, rod, or cam bearings (usually rod bearings), using a cast iron pump
instead of aluminum which allows air to get sucked into the pump between the
case and the pump, or a loose oil pump pickup tube in the case.

I don't like to be a trouble maker, and I hate to say this, but if you've
diagnosed 'hundreds' of engine's with low oil pressure caused by too large
of an oil line, then you've made 'hundreds' of incorrect diagnosis. I'm
sorry.
