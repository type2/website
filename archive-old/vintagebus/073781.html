&gt; Now, I've installed all new wheel cylinders, metal

&gt; back on it won't turn again! the adjusting stars are
&gt; turned down as small as they can go. what gives? the
&gt; drum is totally hanging up on the shoes...
&gt; will this be resolved when i put fluid in the system,
&gt; and pump the pedal a few times?
&gt; do i need to have the inside of the drums resurfaced?
&gt; they're a little pitted and rusty, but still about 50%
&gt; shiny surface.

Sure you have the correct year shoes?  '64+ are bigger.  If you can find
a machinist who isn't really picky about the &quot;legal&quot; thickness limit of
drums have them turned.  Lastly, I recently had to take a grinder to the
leading edges of some shoes to get them to slip on.  You only need to
take them down a small amount to allow the drum to fit.  Crappie reman. tolerances.
