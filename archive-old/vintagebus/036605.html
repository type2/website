Aren't those the same as in a bay window westy?    I have some spares, if you 
didn't already find one.

 Hi all - The other day my overly excited dog Simon spun around
 repeatedly in anticipation of our swimming as I pulled up to a lake.
 Well, I heard an ugly snap and found that his rear had broken the light
 switch to one of the interior, side lights.
 
 Anyone have a spare switch available? The Westy is a 67 and the interior
 
 lights are the striaght sided shades with a white pushbutton switch. The
 
 broken part is the white pushbutton and cuff.
 
 Thanks - Tim
