&lt;&lt; 've been told US dealers would chrome the bumpers on occasion, usually 
only for Deluxe models, as an &quot;add-on&quot; or as a justification for the 
additional price of a Deluxe.
 
 My ex-'54 Single Cab had what was supposedly an original chrome front ribbed 
bumper (non-Barndoor).  It was removed from a Deluxe by the PO.  Details were 
a bit shady.
 
 One of my friends has a chrome front Barndoor ribbed front bumper, picked it 
up at a show for $75.  I do not think that one is original.
  &gt;&gt;

the early style front stamped bumper with the wider stampings was used 
through part of 56, then they went to the style with the narrower stamped 
bits and the wider area for the liscence plate.    I call this Wolfberg or 
Hannover stamped bumper, rather than barndoor, as it was used on circa 60K 
buses post barndoor.


Have seen a poster of many early panel van with logos, and many of the 
barndoors had chromed bumpers and the 53 and earlier panels the trim on the 
rear corners.  I believe it was available to get chromed bumpers, but only 
cause of hearsay.   Hey if you paid someone they would chrome it.  Though it 
mnay be tacky
