&gt;I see a LOT of stuff advertised on ebay as being barndoor that is NOT.  Barndoor is one of those magic words that people search for, like &quot;NOS&quot; and &quot;Empi&quot;, and cojures up dollar signs in people's eyes...
&gt;
On that note, I have seen quite a few sets of bubble taillights on eBay, all were dual-filament but advertised as &quot;Barndoor&quot; taillights.  Case in point:
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=313193414

Barndoor = single-filament bubble
55-57 US-delivered Bus = dual-filament bubble

They would have a bigger market if they were described correctly.  I've had at least 4 people ask me for dual-filament bubbles in the past few months!
