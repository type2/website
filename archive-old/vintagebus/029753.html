&quot;Lars Christensen&quot; &lt;larc_at_tdk.dk&gt; wanted me to forward this to the list,
please respond to him or on-list:


The Question :

Choke Adjustment

My bus stall when the oil get to a temp. around 30 degress celcius (when
it
just got hot).

I have try to adjust it between the 3 marks. It seems that the best result
are a little further down that the lowest mark. I have also changed the
choke, it helped a little. The idle got better, but it still stall.
I live in the mittel of the city so it pretty annoying.

VWenligst Ciao
