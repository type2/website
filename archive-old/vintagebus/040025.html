We need to aknowledge Jon Furst's (hazetguy) leap of faith is parting with 
this manual to an unknown to make the manual available for the &quot;list&quot;.  
Without him this would not have been possible.  As said so many times before 
on the &quot;list&quot;, this is what makes this group special among all the web lists 
out there.

I want to reiterate my offer to help in the scanning of any documents 
considered desirable for sharing among our fellow enthusiasts. Thanks.
