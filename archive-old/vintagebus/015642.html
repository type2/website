This works fine on shoes that have the material RIVITED to the shoe
plates.Most new shoe sets have the material bonded to the shoe
plates.Soaking in gas would scare me let alone burning the material,just
remember this the next time you heat the brakes up.I sy this because I
worked in the testing department of a company that manufactured auto and
heavy truck friction material and have seen many failures due to
contamination.A lot of this was in over the road tests with a fully laden
vehicle,some of the places we ran were: for you SoCal folks Mt. Palomar
grade(look for the onelegged guy riding his bike up to the observatory),The
Lincoln Hwy east and west out of Jennerstown Pa.Som eof the failures did not
take long to surface.This is something I would not do or feel safe with.

..... had to take off the right front drum and reinstall
(didnt have to repack though) , as i forgot to tighten the brake lines in
there and spewed brake fluid all over my new shoes :(  This angered me so
i used a trick i learned (from hoover i think) Soak the brake shoes in
gasoline... then light em on fire... this dries them out... worked a charm
for me anyway (move the shoes well away from your tin of gasoline, and if
you blow yourself up its not my fault.  Use your own judgement as to
safety of above procedure.)
