Subject: Door Handle Removal?

OK folks another of my many questions.  The door handle on a 67 Bus, how do
they come off?  This 67 Panel has 2 different doors and one simply screws on
and the other I'm not sure.  I've tried looking behind it for a clip that
you pop out and a pin, but don't notice either.  I know I missing something
here.  I ask also because I get to take a week off to head to Virginia and
strip a 66 (I think) and what's left of a 61 or older.  Not much on the
older other then Speedometer, switches, Bullet Housing (going on my 67) and
what I think is the cool Church key style gas door.  Anyway that one has
some neat looking chrome door handles I want to get off.
