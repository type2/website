First off I want to say thanks to your replies on the wiper motor.

I was wondering if there were any of you within a reasonable distance to me 
that could help me replace my dogleg with an used factory one.  I also need 
some help on some MINOR pass rocker repair.  The part that needs to be 
replaced is the upper part that goes  over the rubber seal.

If none of you could help me do you know of any decent body shop.  The only 
good ACVW body shop i could in MI has a 3.5 year wait.

I would be happy to pay in cash or labor exchange.

I live in reading MI which is 12 miles from OH or IN.

thanks
