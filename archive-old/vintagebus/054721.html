It sounds like their are a few that are interested in this. I am working on
finding a supplier for the plastic sleeve material (leads anyone???). I have
already made the molds for the caps.
Unfortunately for everyone except me, I just sold my house this weekend and
will spending most of my free time packing and looking for a new house. So
my disclaimer is I will be doing them but it will probably be after the
first of the year before they are ready. As far as cash up front, I don't
think that will be necessary.
Anyone have a house they want to sell in North Tacoma in the $125 to $175
range?
Thanks

  Shawn,

    YES! I planned on using a bay middle seat for my 21w and upholstering it
in vintage style. I would buy a kit to add the grab handles. Need some $$ to
get started?

  Oh the ever sought after middle seat!!

  I am wanting to re-sleeve my middle seat grab bars (63) and noticed that
the
  material on the dash grab handle is the same. since the dash handle is
  reproduced does anyone know who makes them or can supply me with that
  material? I am also in the process of making molds of the chrome end
pieces
  (Deluxes and Standards 62 to 67) so I can reproduce them. My idea is to
sell
  the pieces separately, to allow people to either fix the seats they have,
or
  to sell them a conversion kit to add to a bay window seat.
  If this sounds like a good idea to anyone please p-mail me to let me know,
  for right know I am only making one and reproducing them for sale is only
an
  idea.
  Thanks
  Shawn
