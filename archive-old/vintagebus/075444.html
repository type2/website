Subject: Popout windows

Does anyone have any experience with chrome plating their popout window
trim? I need to pull mine and get rid of the rust anyway, and I sure like
that shiny stuff. I THINK the extra metals are basically too thin to
affect the fit or anything like that, but I'd rather not totally screw
them up.
