I have a '64 Camper. It looks identical to the ones in the ad Josh
posted with a couple of exceptions.
1) my bed does not have extra support legs that fold down. Wheather it
did at one time and they have been removed I don't know. I do know that
the bed doesn't need them. It hold my 200+ frame just fine.

2) Mine is a walk-thru. The one in the ad is a bench, but that may just
be a preference to the customer.

3) On my cooler unit is a sticker saying &quot;CAMPMOBILE&quot;. It appears to be
the same unit as in the picture.

All of the cabnits, the bed layout, table, etc appear to be the same. I
have never worried too much about its real identity as it sits in my
garage awaiting my attention, but now my curiosity is peaked.

Comments and feedback welcome.

BTW, I still have recieved an answer to my question about metal
replacement parts.. I am looking for the name of the peice that the
cargo door's bottom latches go into. It sits inside the rocker panel and
runs the width of the doorway.
