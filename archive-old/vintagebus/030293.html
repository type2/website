Here's what the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot; has to say about ballpark values
for a mid-60s single cab:

1--mint condition (trailer queen):  $11,500
2--well-restored or excellent original: $8,100
3--older resto showing wear, or partly restored but complete:  $4,600
4--driveable, may need minor work, or deteriorated resto:  $2,300
5--needs complete resto but isn't wrecked:  $1,400
6--parts car:  $450

The prices represent data from &quot;collector car auctions, expert opinion,
and verified private sales&quot;.

&gt; A vague question for you.  My youngest son wandered in today after being MIA
&gt; for two days snow boarding in the hills and asked if I was interested in a
&gt; single cab.  Right out of the blue.  I have seen it from the street:
&gt; relatively straight with no obvious cancer, no apparent hits to the nose,
&gt; has all the gates in what appears to be good to very good condition, doors
&gt; and windows.  Fried egg lights I think they are called.  Oh yeah.. it
&gt; changes position and since they live on a rather steep hill in the
&gt; development it has gotta run a little.  Has some sort of rack that you would
&gt; see on a pick up truck for carrying lumber but it is attached to the bed as
&gt; best I can tell and not to the gates.
&gt; 
&gt; So... given your time and experience on the list and with buses in general
&gt; (sorry for the obvious kissing up) what might be considered a reasonable
&gt; price on something like this (if there is such a thing nowadays)?  My son
&gt; said he was selling it cheap but would have to get back to me on how much so
&gt; I really have no idea what's up here other than my wife will hang my exposed
&gt; backside outdoors if I pursue this. (Actually she is very indulgent of this
&gt; poor souls interests).  A crew its not... but a bus it is.
