Subject: [VB] troubleshoot weird engine noise/vibe


Yesterday as I was leaving Home D_at_pot, I noticed when
my rpm's got up just before time to shift to 2nd,
there was some vibration going on.

And along with
it comes some vibration. To me, it sounds as if it's
coming from inside the fan shroud. Any ideas on what
may be causing this?

Thanks,
3DPete
