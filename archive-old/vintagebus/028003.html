Since you guys are discussing beer as well, you should check out our website at gorgevwclub_dot_com and find out when in August our show is this year. Our location is directly across the street from the Full Sail Ale brewery with tours every hour. I do not indulge in the barley basted beverage but most people seem to
think it is one of the better brews.
