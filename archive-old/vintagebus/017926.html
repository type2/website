In a weird way it warmed my heart to hear that the
show sucked~ only in as much as my wife and I decided
not to make the long haul from Phoenix. Over the past
three years we have looked forward to this meet (never
have attended in the old location) but collectively
were too  exhausted in general and our VW enthusiasm
(a sign of parenthood, perhaps?)

In another way, I am disappointed to hear that some
attendees thought it sucked as I have always imagined
this show to be (or to have been) one of the premier
events outside of Bad Camberg, Kelly Park, the Old
Classic/SOTO/OCTO weekend, St.Louis BBTA and the old
location Connecticut show.

VVWCA has always been slanted toward TypeI's (IMHO).
Either mondo old cabriolets or the GeneBerg go fast
stuff. The Kelly Park event that we attended lumped
our 67 SO42 in with the deluxe buses in a &quot;Luxury&quot;
class and biffed the year range by having a 1964 to
&quot;pre-1967&quot; category. Had to get an official ruling on
the '67 splittie!

Did my 'shroom eating obnoxious Jerome camping buddy
&quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; (buttmunch!) from Sacto show?
