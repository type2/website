Subject: Looking for the NC guy with the late model air conditioning parts
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Over a year ago, I was offered some parts from a late model to make my 
vanagon air conditioning work again. For the life of me, I cannot remember 
your name, and have lost my old E-mail file in a computer switch. The parts 
were near Asheville, NC as I remember.

You still out there? Drop me a note.
