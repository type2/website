Hey all,

I checked a few pages of the archives with no success....What's the bolt 
pattern for a 66 bus?  5 X 130mm?  Would love to know?

On a side note my bus is evolving well in the 5 months I've owned him.  
Finally got the dual circuit MC conversion working well..pedal is super 
stiff but have heard this is normal due to lack of booster.  My shifting 
problems are pretty much cured...clutch cable needed tightened a bit and 
wasn't disengaging fully?  After I put in a new front coupler which is 
currently nonexistent he should shift perfect!  Greased the beam which made 
an intense difference! A fellow list member was kind enough to let me check 
out a 33 pict 4 on my 1600dp (currently I'm running a 30/31 with the adapter 
plate) to see if I want to go that route...hoping It'll climb hills better 
and get a little better performance without compromising my 24mpg to much!  
I stripped my whole nose with a stripper wheel on a drill which took 
FOREVER!  Now all the bondo from the previous artist is gone so I can iron 
out the nose for real with out paper mache!  Thanks for listening to the 
progress!

Sprout is Happy and so am I!
