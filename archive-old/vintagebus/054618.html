Subject: Horn problems solved...

Hi all,

Thanks again for the responses to my questions and diagnosis of the horn
problems I was having on my '59 Double Door Panel.

While many had great testing tips, Barb &amp; Eric hit the nail on the head. =

After removing the offending horn, I carefully disassembled it on the
workbench last night.  I marked everything for proper re-assembly.  Once
opened, corrosion was plainly visible as white fuzz all around and betwee=
n
the two &quot;contact&quot; point surfaces.  Once carefully filed and Dremel wire
wheel cleaned, re-assembly was a snap!  And for those who were following =
my
initial questions, If you want to test a horn with an analog multi meter
for continuity (pretend you don't have a auto battery handy), just touch
each tester lead to one of the two wiring contact points.  On a properly
functioning horn your continuity tester &quot;needle&quot; will swing to indicate
full continuity (no resistance).  Anything less will indicate
corrosion/resistance which should be cleaned up.  If you have a auto
battery handy, then just run a wire from the negative terminal to one of
the horn wiring contacts and another wire from the positive terminal to t=
he
other horn wire connector.  You should have a loud, working horn.

Anyway, thanks for the help and advice, my '59 Panels' horn is now able t=
o
blare away at my command.  =


Watch out for the little monsters running around on the streets tonight. =

Have a very safe and Happy Halloween.  =
