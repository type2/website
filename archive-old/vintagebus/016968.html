In addition to the production costs that Kyle
mentioned you would then have to calculate shipping
costs of all items. Figure palleting and ground
transport via Semitruck-tractor. Then on top of all of
that you should try to include some profit margin.

About 1.5 years ago I had the oppty to pick up the
entire NOS inventory of a well known American camper
conversion company for a pretty reasonable price. I
passed on the deal due to cost of running to get and
transport the stuff, then having to warehouse the
stuff, then market it, then figure out how to price it
then figure out costs on and means toward shipping to
potential customers. Not an easy profit maker.

What I have been tempted to do is to draft up proper
plans for various interiors and create a web page or
market the plans. Minor changes to all existing &quot;of
course&quot; to avoid litagation. Sell the plans and let
the customer hack at the wood. Then again *that* is a
limited market. The effort would be for the love of
drafting, I suppose. ;-)
