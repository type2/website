&gt; The IRS conversion is such a variable thing it is hard to

&gt; The only Thing components I know of that are used in a
&gt; regular swap is the
&gt; IRS tranny and/or inner flanged for the CVs.  I have never
&gt; seen Thing CVs
&gt; used.  Normally people use the baywindow CVs 28 degree
&gt; working angle or the
&gt; T4 CVs with a 32 degree working angle (expensive like $75
&gt; each).

&gt; Check out Bus Boys for details on what seems to be the route
&gt; you are going.
&gt; Volksworld did a DIY article on this a while ago as well.

&gt; From my research you will need to buy modified axles,
&gt; control arm mounts
&gt; (clamp on or welded), and maybe spring plates.

&gt; Old Speed has a stock height kit that uses Beetle stuff...=20
&gt; Which means you
&gt; can put early 944 rear brakes on it :)   Or T3 brakes.

&gt; The shop talk forum usually has loads of custom information
&gt; if you want to
&gt; check it out.
