Subject: Broken Fan

My generator was giving me some trouble last week or so I thought. It
was making some grumbly noises, so I checked the belt and pulley, no
problems there.  I did run the engine for a second or two sans belt and
the noise went away, so my first thought was to remove it and shot put
it through the window at the Auto Zone I bought it from (only two months
ago).

So we go to a local foreign parts store and the kid hands me a
&quot;reconditioned&quot; generator  that looks like it was put together by a nine
year old from the Far East. It had a quarter inch of end play and the
woodruff key slot was welded shut on the fan end! &quot; The end play is
normal&quot;, the Lobot owner tells me from behind the safety of his counter.
I had to throw a smoke bomb to make my escape.

Long story short, it turns out my fan had a crack in a complete circle
below the 36mm nut.
