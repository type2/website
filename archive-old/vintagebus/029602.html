I have a freeway flyer in my 60 Double Cab with a 1776 running dual Weber 40
carbs. No other really special hop up bits or pieces and it does fine. I ski quite
a bit so do lots of mountain driving. Sure the 2110 was nicer but this works great
at half the price and less reliability issues. I am convinced that big motors can
and do live fine normal lives it just takes a little more money (like twice). That
is the beauty of the 1776, more power without a ton of cash. I do have stock size
valves which might help keep the torque on the bottom end. Maybe the combination
of big valves and ratio rockers is sucking away your bottom end in place of real
top end power. There are a lot of variables in this debate.
hope this helps,
