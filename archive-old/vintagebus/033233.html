&lt;&lt; Thanks. Does this apply to an 009 too? I hear so many different stories on 
how to time. When I picked up my rebuilt long block, I put in a new 009, and 
then when I asked the shop about where to statically time the engine, they 
went on about how static timing is only good for the vacuum advance 
distributors, and I needed to get an adjustable timing light, and....
  That was about two years (and only 5k miles) ago, and she seems to be 
running really well with my static timing, but I would really like to dial it 
in right, just to be sure. &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
Yes, static is best because when you time it at 0 RPM it is exactly 0 RPM!  
With a strobe light one has has to have the engine running and a tach to show 
where the timing is according to engine RPM.  While using the strobe is fine 
to show where it tops out without a tach it is not showing the whole 
condition of the distributor.  If the distributor is not advancing enough and 
set by strobe light for top RPM advance the timing is going to be way too 
advanced at idle and a little higher which will not be good for the engine.  
Set by static light the same problem will result in an engine that will not 
advance enough which will not result in detonation at any RPM.  Anyone with a 
VW should check out the Old Volk Home web page about distrbutors to find out 
as much as they can about what they are running!   Eric&amp;Barb
