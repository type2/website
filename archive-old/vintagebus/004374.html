Hi,

How can you tell if the rings are seated?  What does that
actually mean?  Do you really want to use crappy oil and let
the metal wear out a little for the first 500-2000 miles?
Why do the car manufacturers use new oil on a new engine?
They could save a bundle loading recycled oil into all the
new cars.

&quot;I gots to know.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Anyhoo, crank it with the coil wire off until the oil
light goes
&gt; out. Plug the coil in and fire it up.
&gt;
&gt; It probably wouldn't hurt to pull the rocker arms off
during this
&gt; procedure.  After you have cranked it for oil pressure,
squirt plenty of
&gt; oil on the rocker assemblies,valves etc. re-install, check
valve
&gt; clearances.  Double check oil level before running in the
cam.  I even
&gt; overfill it.  As Kyle mentioned, don't use something like
Castrol until
&gt; you get the rings seated or they won't ever seat. BTDT.  I
used to use
&gt; Kendall 20 wt. non-detergent for the first few hundred,
running it
&gt; gently then valvoline 30wt. non-detergent untill about
2000 miles, but
&gt; I've had trouble finding the Kendall oil lately.  At about
2000 miles
&gt; Castrol goes in.
