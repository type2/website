Well, so far the concensus is that there is something wrong with the idle
jet.  I did use almost a complete can of carb cleaner on it, pulled the jets
and blew them out with the cleaner.  I also went thru EVERYPLACE that even
remotely looked like it might be a passage ( had carb cleaner in my face
when they weren't).
Thanks for the responses so far, I'm still working on it.
BTW, for those of you who suggested a vaccum leak, nope, all connections
etc. are good and tight, no holes where they shouldent be.

Jon
