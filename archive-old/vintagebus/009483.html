Subject: Jeremy Vreeman is still alive.

I just got off the phone with Mr.VW himself and he's still doing well.  We
talked for 1 and 1/2 hours!!!  There's lot's to say but I was glad to hear
that he's still working on VWs!  His current ride is an Audi A4 and his job
is in downtown Chicago as a financial advisor/planner for people and
businesses.  He just finished restoring a Ghia that cost the guy $36,000 but
it's a show quality car and the fella drives it all over.  Jeremy said it
was his best project to date.

He has thought about getting on the list but has so much going on now.  I
think after talking to him, I can say that he might make a surprise
appearance eventually on the list this year.  He wanted me to let you all
know his email address and welcomes all the mail you can send him at:
mrvw74_at_aol_dot_com

Those of you who emailed me about Jeremy had your emails read in full to him
on the phone.  He remembers all of you and would like for you to email him
directly.  He remembered:

Russ in Spokane
DR Wahlgren
Michael Pelikan
Wes (that now owns Jeremy's bus) - Jeremy wanted me to give you his phone
numbers so I'll be doing that in a private email - he wants you to call him.
Brian Brookhouse
Drew McCoy

So there you have it - Mr.VW is still alive and surprisingly still restoring
and occasionally driving ACVWs.  His GTI got totalled when he was broadsided
at 40mph by a guy trying to cut across the median to get into his proper
lane.  Thankfully, all it did was bruise his hip.   His car was fast
though - 97mph in 15seconds in the 1/4 mile when he dragged it.  It was cool
to talk to him and we are planning to meet face to face in Omaha in July
sometime when he passes thru enroute to Colorado this year on a trip.

It was good to hear our buddy is still around.  He was totally blown away by
the fact that we still talk about him and his amazing feats.  I think one
might go so far as to say he was honored. :-)
