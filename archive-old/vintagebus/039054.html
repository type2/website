&gt;Would not wood work better?  If you used strips of wood they would 
&gt;stick to the glue far better.  Wonder if thin plywood could fit in there?


I made a complete set of panels (door, kick, and headliner) for my 58 sc out
of &quot;Luan door skin&quot;.  I believe this extremely thin, 1-ply wood is used to
replace the covering on hollow-core doors in you house.  Comes in a 3x7
sheet from your local discount hardware store for about $6.  The hole
project cost me under $20 (including stain, new trim screws, and a few
jig-saw blades) and took about 8 hours work.  Probably would have been a few
hours faster if I'd had some old panels to use as templates!

The door skin wood is really easy to cut and work with and is just the right
thickness for panels.  It can be warped to fit the necessary curves by
wrapping a hot, wet towel around the areas to be be bent.  After they dry,
they retain the shape so you can test-fit them and adjust as necessary then
sand them down and finish them in your favorite color or stain.  Not
original, but very nice looking and a WHOLE lot cheaper than buying repros!!

I'll try to take a few pics this evening and get them loaded up to the Web
and let you all know where they are.
