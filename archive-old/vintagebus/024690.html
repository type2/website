As far as liver transplants go . . .it is true that you cannot &quot;buy&quot; one. 
But I am reminded of the joke where the child asks his father to explain 
the difference between fantasy and reality. The reality here is, there is 
a waiting list. But basically, the doctors making the life and death 
decisions can call it the way they see it and do. Personally, I could not 
handle that responsibility. But they do every day. And if they think a 
man with a pocket full of money just might make a donation for, lets say, 
a new wing on the hospital and the docs involved think that ultimately, 
they can accomplish more, then what decision do you think they will 
make?? And, if they like the music that doesnt hurt either. Or if they 
have 2 candidates vying for the same liver and one of them has never 
accomplished any thing in his life and the other is a star in a rock and 
roll band bringing joy to millions. . .

Fantasy vs. Reality

By the way, my brother in law is waiting for his FOURTH!! liver!!!!!
