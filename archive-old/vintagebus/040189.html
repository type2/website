Hey All,

Hope everybody had a great weekend.  About a week ago it was real cold and I 
pulled my wipers back during a phil up to wash the windows...when I pushed 
the wiper arms back to the glass the wiper shaft snapped DOH!  Today on the 
way to work with rain I utilized my euro single wiper converions (ha ha)on 
the drivers side only to have it snap off into traffic minutes late 
_at_!$!%$^$DOH!%!$^^&amp;^!  No biggie I was runnin beetle arms anyway have a set 
of bus arms but need blades and the nut/bolt that holds the arm to the shaft 
not the bolt on the spring.  Is there anyway to jerry rig the shaft with 
welding or something or do I have to score some new wiper linkage?  Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.

Eric
