&gt; I've been shy about spending my money on this type of thing ever since.  Is
&gt; there a real *quality* (as in today's OEM quality) electronic ignition for
&gt; VWs out there, which doesn't cost an arm and a leg?  And is there any
&gt; noticable benefit, aside from the elimination of points and condensor?

I'm pleased with the setup I've got.  I use the Pertronix Ignitor (sp?) + 
Universal Corporation's Tiger 581 capacitive discharge ignition (CDI).  
I got both of these some time ago from aircooled_dot_net.  I like not having
to mess with my ignition very often, although I do check it at every valve
adjustment.  Plus I can gap my plugs almost twice as wide.  And if you thought
starting a 12V bus with a 6V starter made it easy, you haven't tried CDI :-)

You cannot get to Bob Hoover's 1999 posting to RAMVA on the subject thanks
to the former Deja archive's current state, but I have a hard copy of it.
It's a bit long for me to retype (5 pages), plus maybe I shouldn't given how
he seems to feel about his copyright.  But I'd be happy to answer questions
from it :-)

Also, to Adrian whose post just appeared as I was typing this, the Tiger 581
is made in Colorado, not Taiwan, and from what I understand they are happy
to replace defective units.  I've never had one go bad so YMMV.  You should 
try giving 'em a call when you have more time:

970-242-5267

Of course, no dig if you decide to go back to points either!
