JUst learn it's limits, the rotor's were used on Volvo's and BMW's and come
in different rev limiting RPM's, but I don't think there is one that will go
down to 4000 or less RPM's, I put these in the maniac off road machines
around here but use a 5500 to 6000 g's one.

-subject: [VB] Rev limiting distributor rotor arm?


Hi list,

I was told over the weekend about an accessory rotor arm used to limit
engine revs to a predetermined level. Are these available and if so from
whom?
