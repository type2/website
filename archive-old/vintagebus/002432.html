Thom - thanks for the info on the Safari windows.  I was wondering if it's
possible to just get the safari window seals.  I would assume they are all
pretty close in design in that you need a clamping action of the seal to the
window frame and then a flat surface in which the glass mates to the seal.
I'd like to get ahold of a seal or at least a section of one so I could kind
of see how it all works.  I would like to try making my own Safari.
Someone's gotta do it right...
