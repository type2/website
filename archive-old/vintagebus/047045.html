 Is there anywhere that shows the colors available for busses? I have a 
 '62 and I'd like to find out my options. Also, I have seen busses that 
 are one color and some with two colors. Are they both correct or is the 
 two tone just for the deluxe models ?
  &gt;&gt;
about 99% of the time, the passenger models (deluxe and standard micros) were
two tone, and the commercials (kombis, panels, trucks, etc) were one colour.

in 62 the two tone schemes were turquoise/blue white and sealing wax red/beige
rey, while the one tones were I think SWR, dove blue, some sort of white- i
think pearl white,- no Ivory  and I think also ruby red (very rare).   

Hope this helps.
