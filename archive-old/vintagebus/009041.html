Clara-
If you could forward some original paint codes
i will try to find the corresponding powdercoat #'s.
i.e. silver white, pearl white, etc.
Powdercoat can also be made to match the &quot;fade factor&quot;.
As you know, a perfect match for the original color
may not match that color as it is now, after years of
exposure and such.
Powder can be applied any way you want, it
would require an extra &quot;bake&quot; for the extra color,
because of masking.
There's no reason to not powder where the tire
mounts- it's essentially the same problem with
paint being damaged by improper technique or outdated
mounting equipment. A proper tire machine never
touches the rim in the bead area, a machine which
can mount alloy rims is capable of this.
