Subject: Re: [VB] clutch/flywheel question

  You can remove the collar for the t/o bearing on the 1200 engine to get the clutch to work. Not a good thing for long 
term but will work in a clinch.
  You will need a 12 volt to 6 volt starter bushing to install the 6 volt starter and again you can run it on 12 volts for a 
while

&gt;I have a 1200 out of an early bus. A buddy of mine wants to put it in later bus. A 71 camper. He is getting his 1600 
rebuilt. What clutch/fly wheel combo does he need. The flywheel on the 1200 is a 6volt I`m pretty sure. The problem I 
See is that the 71 tranny has the collar for the t/o bearing.  Any suggestions?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Dave
