&gt; I just acquired a 66 microbus from an auction for $150.. yeah!... but i'm in
&gt; the process of moving so i can have more room for the buses... does anybody
&gt; know of any place in the East Bay, CA that I could temporarily store the bus
&gt; until I move?  Thanks.

Take it to one of those &quot;U Store&quot; places, where you can stash it
short term for ~$30 a month.  If you were closer I'd say
bring it to my house and we could put it out to pasture with my '55 and
'56.
