I epoxied the L bracket type under my tray, out of sight. 

Saturday's project is to cut the dash and lower windshield section out of a slowly disappearing bus at a junkyard. A good old junk yard with old bikes, washers, donkey sh*t and donkeys. Hope it's dry under the windshields. 

In my tray? Church key, ashtray because it won't fit with a bay wiper mech., wires, junk. 

I'll miss the Solvang/Buelton show, a buddy is getting married on Sat., which he regrets because he'd rather drive his '64 Ghia to the meet. 

Just heard of new law enforcement technology that can shut off a car's fuel supply from a pursuit vehicle. No details yet, but probably only works on newer cars. Another reason to drive an old VW bus.
