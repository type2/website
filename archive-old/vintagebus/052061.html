&gt;    We just recieved the ultimate auction prize. A limited edition 60's
&gt; BARBIE, this is a must have for all you bus people. 

hey ronnie, do you have the 70s barbie yet?  i remember you really wanting her and telling me that you'd be mad if i got her before you.  well, i'm not gonna have her for bbb but will for the next bus adventure... oh yeah, you can be sure i'm gonna get a bunch of raffle tickets for the 60s barbie!  who needs a tranny or a turnkey engine when you have barbie?  haha!

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://www.stanford_dot_edu/~rahaha/pig.html
