                           :ATTENTION  ALL  CAMPERS:

  Officially Jerome Jamboree IX is a 2-day event, not 3 as some people think. 
  Unless you are on the list to help out at the event, or are from out of 
state, there will be no Friday night camping. NO one will enter till 12:00 
noon on Friday, there are NO exceptions.  Also PLEASE no reserving of camping 
spots.
  JEROME JAMBOREE IX does not officially start till the caravan from Phoenix 
arrives.  Also NO raffle tickets or t-shirt sales will commence till the 
caravan arrives...

                          -----MONSTER CARAVAN-----  

  The caravan from Phoenix to Jerome is a very BIG part of the whole Jerome 
weekend experience.  While we would like everyone to participate in the 
caravan, we know this is almost impossible.  There`s nothing like seeing 100 
to 150 VW`s single file heading up I-17 (right lane of course).  The looks 
you get from passing vehicles and the thumbs up is something to remember.  
THIS IS A CARAVAN NOT A RACE.

  The caravan will be in 3 stages.
  (1) Caravan will leave from the Home Depot at 7:00 am (meet at 6:00 am) 
I-17 / Thunderbird Rd.  Every registered vehicle in the caravan will receive 
a free raffle ticket good for 2 special raffle prizes on the way up to Jerome.
  (2)  Approx. 60 miles later, we will stop at Sunset Point to cool the 
engines, bathroom break etc., and the first caravan raffle prize will be 
raffled.
  (3)  Then on to Prescott Valley for our second stop.  There we will 
converge on BACKROADS FOREIGN ENT. (VW SHOP). Craig &amp; Co. have stepped up and 
offered his place for the second stop. B.F.E &amp; Co. will provide refreshments 
and host the second caravan raffle.  After the raffle we will all regroup and 
head up Mingus Mtn. to the Gold King Mine in Jerome.  Arrival time should be 
somewhere around 11:00 am.
  Only 2 caravan raffle prizes will be given away.  Everyone else hang on to 
the raffle tickets, as they will be put into the main raffle at the event.  
There is a probability that a caravan raffle ticket could win the 1965 CREW 
CAB.  Which means, by your participation in the caravan, you could win the 
Raffle truck and save .50 cents........................ 

THE CARAVAN ARRIVING AT THE GOLD KING MINE OFFICIALLY STARTS
                                 JEROME JAMBOREE IX
