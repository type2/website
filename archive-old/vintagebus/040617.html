Subject: snow closing today

Importance: Normal

Due to today's unexpected blizzard (they predicted 1 inch in our area; we
have 1 foot so far!), we will be closing early today.  Unfortunately,
neither UPS nor the mail are offering local service, so all orders
(including next-day-air orders) will be delayed by one day since we have no
one to ship them with.  We will be reopening tomorrow during normal hours,
11-7 E.S.T.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

Now I have to go see if my Vanagon can make it out of the parking lot, up a
hill that's a foot deep with snow.  I might not be leaving after all. Sure
wish I had a Syncro...
