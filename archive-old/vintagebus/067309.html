Subject: Re: [VB] Upper front grease fitting.  And ramble...

&gt; Small problem with fitment and the upper axle grease nipple/fitting.  
&gt; Right now I have a 90 degree angle fitting, and it rubs a little bit 
&gt; on the wheel inner edge.  Very little around sharp turns, but still 
&gt; annoying.  I ground some of the edge off the grease fitting, but want 
&gt; a better solution that does not stick up so high.

All of my grease fittings are straight on both buses. Most likely a PO 
replaced it with that 90 degree because it was handy.

&gt;
&gt; I am guessing a stright nipple fitting will plop right on there?  

I would expect.

&gt; Any experience on switching this fitting?  

Nope.
