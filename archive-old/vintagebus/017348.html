Ahhh....just so you know, there is a big difference between MIG and TIG especially in price.  A quality MIG (metal inert gas) welder from Linclon or Miller will run you around 600 bucks +.  I like my Miller XP130.  It has metal guide rollers that most of the cheaper brands don't.  It's never let me down or jammed once.  

Yes I'd love to have a TIG too, but those run about 1500 and  take a bit more skill to run.  Nothing too hard but still takes more practice than zapping a mig bead.  Still though the quality of a TIG weld is far superior plus the benefit of far less heat buildup and excess weld to grind.  

Stick with the quality machines...stay away from the 299 POS's.



Steve

Lincoln or Miller are the best inexpensive brands.  Get MIG/TIG
