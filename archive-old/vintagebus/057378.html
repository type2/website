Subject: Re: FW: [VB] Early high-roof

I believe all european buses dropped semaphores after
61, and in 62 went to bullet turn signals, regardless
of the rear tail lights. They got bigger rear lights
when us Americans did.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Rich,
&gt; Believe 63 was the first year for highroofs.
&gt; 
&gt; From 1961-64 Italy and some other Euro countries had
&gt; those as standard 
&gt; equipment due to thier traffic laws.  Check the
&gt; parts manual for the bullet 
&gt; turn signals for specific dates/chassi #.
