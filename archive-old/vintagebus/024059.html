Subject: 67 brake converstion and door stop Q

Hi all...

I have a 67 bus with bad brakes (master cyl).  I went to our local
'bow-wow' and the people there said the best thing to do is to convert
my master cylinder to a 68 mc.  Ok, great... so has anyone done this? 
Does it work well.  I bought it, took it home and held it up to the (i
suppose) stock 67 mc.  So, the existing reservoir will not fit.  Any
ideas for this (how about two small ones).  Any hints from listees who
have done this conversion would be SUPER cool.

Also, I want to install on my bus those cute rubber side door
stoppers... you know, they attach to the body near the hinges and stop
the door from crashing into the body when you open it all the way up. 
Anyway, I bought those rubber stoppers and want to install them.  I need
to know how far (inches or cm) from the edge of the door I should put
them.  I suppose I could guess but I sorta want to do it as close to
stock as possible.

Thanks,

good to see the list up again.

Darin
