Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

I put pink fiberglass in the front doors of a bus I owned in the 70's. I did
it because I was basically freezing to death in the winter. I was amazed how
much warmer it made the bus by just putting the bats in the doors. Wasn't
even worried about condensation or noise. Is styrofoam as good an insulator
as the pink fiberglass stuff?

I used 1&quot; thick styrofoam w/ foil on one side and plastic on the other to
insulate my kombi. Before I had a big problem with moisture due to the cold
metal inside would attact moisture during the night and in the morning the
whole roof and sides would be wet. I mean like dripping wet. Installed the
styrofoam panels and no more moisture. Between that and padded carpet boards
on the floor and parcel deck it quited it down allot. The styro panels were
about 7 bucks each at Lowes for a 1&quot; x 4' x 8' sheet and it took like 4-5
sheets to do the whole bus. Now if I could just get time to finish the 2
worse places to panel......the roof and the rear corners...... Got a DD
Panel to get rolling so I guess it waits......lol.
