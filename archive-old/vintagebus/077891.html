Subject: Re: [VB] Wiper Switch needed/and suggestions?

You have a  67right?, with this talk of 2 speed wipers.   Before assuming the 
switch is bad, you should make the motor work w/o the switch.  I cant 
remember which wires you need to give power to.   When testing a wiper motor I always 
have to figure it out again.  however, there is this double ground idea they 
have which is very odd.  I recommend taking a wire and clipping one end to the 
wiper motor and the other to the bus just to check if the ground was bad.  
does it work now?

Also, did the wiper motor used to work ie just stop one day, or has the bus 
sat for years?...  Does the motor do nothing, or does it make unhappy 
complaining noises and not move?   If the latter it wants to be taken out, have the old 
grease cleaned out, and given some nice fresh grease put in the gears, 

after I painted my 65 and put the wiper motor back in the wiper motor didn't 
work till I added teh extra ground wire cause i forgot to sand where the motor 
grounds against the frame, which had been covered w/ paint.

oh, some of the wires operate the self park system.

&gt;Here's what I've done to check it.  I've jumped across to the low and &quot;high

&gt;OK.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know the function of the other two wires running to the wiper motor.
&gt;Is 31b ( I believed that's the lettering on the switch), the brown wire on 
the
&gt;switch a ground of sorts.
