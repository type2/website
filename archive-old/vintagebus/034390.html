Subject: RE: Judson Supercharger

I've read in a couple of places (Wilson and an original
motor mag review of the judson?) that they cannot
be 'realistically' used in a bus without causing
*severe* overheating problems (like meltdown)........

For some reason, while Judsons are rarish here in Aus,
they are around and the component most often missing 
seems to be the pulley rather than the oil bottle etc

Has anyone here run a Judson in a bus?

&gt; Hello all.  Well I finally broke down and did it.  I bought a Judson
&gt; Supercharger today, just had to have it.  I know they don't do a whole lot
&gt; but I have always wanted one.  Does anyone have any experience with these?
&gt; 
&gt; Performance secrets?  Bus installation?  Any help is appreciated, 
&gt; otherwise I guess I'll figure it out.  My count only includes one 58
&gt; double
&gt; door at present I have been cleaning up as to start bying again.
