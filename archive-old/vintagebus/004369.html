Mike writ:

&gt; I am planning on going down south from Sacramento. What I am looking for
is a
&gt; good route to take from people that have driven down before. What hills to
&gt; avoid and where to avoid them. I guess what is the most popular route for
the
&gt; busses?

Looks like the consensus is 99 south and over the grapevine. I'm hooking up
with Harry and Karl in Fresno, so it just doesn't make sense to try to use
I-5. Also, there is better availability of gas, food, rest stops and auto
parts suppliers on 99. I spoke to Jethro and Sandy from Sacramento and  they
expressed the same preference. Thom, are you going? When? Perhaps a
disorganized caravan is in order for Friday?
