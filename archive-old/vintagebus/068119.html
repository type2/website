Subject: Re: [VB] (friday's) Bright Idea?

For some reason I have loads of 6V light bulbs, and only one 6V VW.

My stack of 12V bulbs has gone low.

Last time I had a headlight go out I went to the closest FLAPS and got one 
for cheap.   wouldn't hurt to have a few spares I guess.

&lt;&lt; Nope, youre being prudent. I started collecting litte stuff for my bus
 back when I bought it in 73 - it's the way to go. Now I continue to buy
 what I need, but one of these days, theyre gonna run out, and I'll have
 that piece I bought in '78 or 82.
