Hi Steve,
Just went out and got a long board and some sandpaper to go along with it.  I will update you all on my progress.  Thanks for the input.

&gt; Ed,

&gt; Are you guide coating before sanding?  Do you know what it is?  If not, you should be doing it.  It is a process of spraying a little flat black or colored primer over the area to be sanded.  This will allow you to see where your low spots are (they will be the areas where there is still paint left).  You should also be using a long board to help you get the area straight (at least 14&quot;).  Use a cross hatch sanding pattern.
&gt;
&gt; As for the rounded corners try soft foam blocks and or bendable flat faced sanding board.  Try Eastwood for the boards for corners, they are made out of bendable metal with a foam face.  I've not tried them, but they seem like they would work.
&gt;
&gt; Check out autobodystore_dot_com for a great BBS and good prices on body work stuff.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck.

&gt;
&gt; Decided to do what little body work needs to be done on my '67 Camper
&gt; myself.  Being an original California car, there is no rustwork/welding
&gt; that needs to be done.
&gt;
&gt; My concerns are mainly in both rear corners, which already had body
&gt; filler applied from the previous owner, (I'm the second owner of this
&gt; camper).  I've sanded and re-filled both corners about 360 times each.
&gt; With the curves in the metal, I seem to just keep sanding off all of the
&gt; filler that I apply.  The other area I'm having problems with is above
&gt; the rear wheel well lip, just below the air vents.  I fill and then sand
&gt; this area until it is smooth, but when I run a straight-edge over this
&gt; area, it is constantly bowed in, indicating again, that I am sanding off
&gt; too much filler.  I expect a certain amount of re-doing what I've done,
&gt; and I don't expect to become an expert body repair person in just a few
&gt; weekends, but does anyone have any tips for doing this work?  I've
&gt; decided not to fill in the sides of my bus and block sand them with the
&gt; 14 inch sanding blocks to get that super-smooth, mirror like flatness to
&gt; the sides.  This bus will be my daily driver, and my sides are already
&gt; pretty straight.  I want to be able to park it without worrying about
&gt; it.  Any help or tips would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Ed Richardson
