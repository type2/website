Subject: Pomona, Want Passenger Door.

Hi All,

I am still looking for a particularly good passenger door
for my early 64. I would like a flip out handle style door.
Additionally, I am looking for a passenger door pillar and a
front skin out to the V. If any of you guys want to sell
one, bring it to Pomona on Sunday.

P-mail me if you will bring one. Let me know who you are and
which booth you will have if you can. I will make a point to
see you and buy the parts if I like them.

Thanks much,

Chris
