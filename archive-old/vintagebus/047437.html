 I have just done some stuff to my '60 DC with a dual-port 1600 with
 H30/30PICT Solex, stock exhaust and air cleaner, 009 distributor, probably
 between 12K and 15K on the engine, which turns an early '67 tranny and
 RGB's.  Rear tyres are 215/75 15's, fronts are 165/? 15's.  I have installed
 (temporarily) a SunPro MiniTach (which I checked against my new digital
 gauge from Actron), would like to report that my shifting tendencies are
 between (max-acceleration) 3700 and 4000 from 1st to 2nd, 3500 to 3800 from
 2nd to 3rd, and 3000 to 3500 from 3rd to 4th.  Repeat:  These are MAX, and
 are made by driving like I normally do, and checking....as opposed to
 changing my driving to accommodate the tach.  My preferred top cruising
 speed, 60mph, tachs at 3500 rpm, while my &quot;other&quot; preferred cruising speed,
 55 mph, comes in at 3000.  I guess these figures are OK...any comments?  I
 am trying to abide by the 1500-3500 rpm rule of the thumb.
= = = = =
sounds normal for max speeds when shifting.  some people like to cruise at 
4K, but I am not one of them.  I VW says top/ cruising speed is about 
3500-3700 rpms, but I believe the motor runs cooler/less stress at 3K for 
cruising.  But I run the rpms up to about what you do for shifting too.   
depends on whether I'm on the flat or not too.

 I checked my compression today after adjusting my valves.  My (new last
 week) plugs are dry black around the edge, and the tips are light tan to
 almost black (#2 is the darkest).  I suspect that I'm running rich. (Gee,
 you don't say....really?).  The compression results are as follows:  Engine
 cold:  #1=120,#2=125,#2=125,#4=125.  Engine hot:
 #1=135,#2=140,#3=140,#4=140.  So what gives?  Maybe PO did not cc the heads?
 =  == = 

you are supposed the do a compression test with the engine warmed up.  Now I 
know why.    they are all close to each other- dont worry.
 However, all the plugs should be the same colour.   I would inspect the plug 
wires and cap.  is it running evenly on all 4 cyls?  do the pull one plug 
wire off the dist at a time, then hold it close to the hole in the cap (use 
rag to not shock yourself) and listen to the diff sound as you let it run on 
4 vs 3 cyls.  do this for all four.   the sound change SHOULD be the same for 
all 4.  if not, you probably have a spark distribution prob- examine the wire 
for the one that makes the least dif (which is probably the darkest plug)   
and also a new cap can change this.   maybe you need new wires?

 Then I messed with those neat screws on the carburetor.  Don't know what the
 hell I was doing...I was trying to figure out why my plugs are black, and
 why I'm only averaging 20mpg.....any help on that?  Also, this carb has a
 weird dual-adjustment idle speed screw...it sits on/adjusts a bent plate
 with a rubber bubble/foot on the inside that keeps the main idle speed screw
 from contacting the fast idle cam when the engine is hot.  I would love to
 know how to properly set up this carb!
= = = = 
what I do with a 30/31 pict is adjust the big screw first.  turn it in till 
it starts to die, then turn it out 3 half turns. (or 1 1/2 turns if you like) 
 then take the little screw driver and turn the little screw in till it 
starts to die, then out 3 half turns.  then do the big again.  back and 
forthe till they are adjusted to each other and you dont change the setting.  
 this usually means the big screw is about 4 half turns out from closed.  I 
have runs a 30/31 pict on my bug for 9 years and it's fine. (and a 009- no 
flat spot)

 Dwell is around 43-47????  What the hell does that mean?
 =  == = =
it means something to do with your point gap.  Think it is supposed to be 50 
plus of minus a few .  try readjusting your points till it is closer to 50.  
such as 48-52.  This is off the top of my head, I could have this wrong.

 So the thing still makes funny noises upon startup/warmup.  I don't want to
 hear noises like that, but then again, I'm a paranoid one.  I'll be heading
 off into the snow country (Mt. Shasta) with Brian Piercy and crew this
 coming up Friday, and I don't want to leave anything to chance.
 
 Later, &gt;&gt;

also, check for vacuum leaks.  are your carb bolts to manifold snug?   are 
the DP boots between center and outer manifold good?  get a screwdriver and 
check that the hose clamps on them are snug.  are there leaks around the plug 
in the rear (faces you as you look at the motor) of the carb?  I have had to 
JB weld this back in, or if it is gone file a dime down slightly and use that 
instead.  Perhaps I should get some pfennigs to use to be cool?

what are your funny noises like?  you did adjust the valves, ya?   have fun 
on your trip, and keep a flashlight with good batteries behind the drivers 
seat.
