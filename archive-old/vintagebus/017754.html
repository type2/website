Interesting...sounds like it could be unsafe if not
done correctly though?  

How do they 'bend' the control arms and weld them
up....just curious :-)

&gt; &lt;&lt; Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone
&gt; that's actually done it), 
&gt; that
&gt;  you can swap the spindles in the front from the
&gt; left side to the right, and
&gt;  vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting
&gt; the camber, or bumpsteer.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Actually there is a guy with I think a 67 hard top
&gt; deluxe that lives in
&gt; Vegas 
&gt; and works at a casino there.  Its lime green and
&gt; white.  He reversed the 
&gt; spindles on his but from the description of the
&gt; work, I would rather just
&gt; buy 
&gt; some dropped spindles.  He had to cut the spindles
&gt; and reweld, i wont go
&gt; into 
&gt; detail because I kinda think it's rather rediculous.
&gt;  Alot of work and time 
&gt; when you could just buy spindles. JMHO
&gt; 
&gt; See you all at Jerome!
