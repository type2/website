Wasn't the item sent by woody incomplete?
That's what I was told.
He sent the other party and ambulance partition form a bus, it was to be 
complete less glass. The partition was missing the inner frame to hold the 
glass entirely.
If I was to sell a bus popout, and claim it was complete less glass, you 
would expect a frame right!?
I saw that hanging light that was traded to woody in person, looked good to 
me, no cracks or chips.
Whats your idea of a restoration? Dish soap? Adding a bulb?
Nothing against Woody, he seems like a nice guy, but he is telling *HIS* side 
of the story.

Hi All,

    I have a question.I bartered a bus part with a gentleman on this list.

the deal went as follows.

We each had a bus part the other wanted.We both decided to send each other

the parts at the same time.

I sent this fellow the part the same day.Three weeks go by and I have not

received the part I was suppose to get and he has received my part and had

it for 2 1/2 weeks.I email him and he apoligizes

and says he will send it out asap.A week later I receive his part. Another 5

weeks goes by and he now wants to reneg on the deal .In the meantime I have

completely restored the part he sent me.(It wasn't

in the condition he claimed).How fair is that ?? My opinion is if he wasn't

happy he should have contacted me sooner.I have invested a lot of time

restoring the part he sent me.

What is the lists take on this ?

Should there be NO time limit for someone to voice his regrets ????

I feel in the 2 to 3 weeks he had my part(before he sent me his part) he

should have realized it was not what he wanted.Then it was another 5 weeks

before he said anything.
