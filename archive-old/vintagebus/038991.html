Fig, that was *exactly* what I was referring to. Since I'm replacing original parts, I didn't know the shape was a result of time and pressure. Thanks for clearing that up for me!

&gt;I don't know if it's what you're referring to, but there are two o-rings in
&gt;the seal kit in addition to the axle oil seal and the bearing cover
&gt;gaskets.
&gt;
&gt;The larger o-ring fits between the bearing cover and the bearing, while the
&gt;inner o-ring slips over the axle, snugs up against the bearing inner race,
&gt;then is mashed in place by the spacer on the axle. This mashing makes it
&gt;sort of wedged in section, tho it started out round. Geddit?
