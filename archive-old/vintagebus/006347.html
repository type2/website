I have been looking for a long time for tires for my 60 with 15&quot; rims - I'm
currently running on Goodyear Aquatreads - 235/60/15 (or is the 65) anyway,
in today's junk mail I see that crappy tire is selling 205/75/15 roughrider
tires, load range SL for $70 Canadian - anyone have experience with rough
rider tires - they also sell the big name brands but not in the 205/75/15
size - I don't know what load range SL means but they do say they are light
truck.

Sorry about beating this tire horse into the ground again

TIA
