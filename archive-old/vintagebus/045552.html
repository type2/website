 That would be a 70.  Worthless IMHO.

a

in
 &gt; it, thought someone else might be.  The yard is in Fairfield, CA.

well, just in case the junkyard guys have it wrong, check the VIN on the bus. 
 look in the windsheild from in from of over by the drivers side, there is a 
tag there I think starting in 1969 models and should read ie 230xxxxxxx if it 
is a 70, the 3rd digit being the yast digit of the model year.  oh, ya, you 
may have to move the dash detritus.
