Okay list,


A question for a change...

Several yrs ago, i had a rebuilt tranny installed, which had a different
TO bearing setup than the old stuff I was used to . It has a brass sleeve
surrounding the first two or three inches of trannie shaft and is mounted
to the trannie housing with three screws. I am told that this setup is the
'71 or 'later' type setup. In addition, the pressure plate doesn't have
the inner ring that the TO bearing contacts in the older style setup.
Instead, there are just the fingers coming into the center area of the
pressure plate,and the TO bearing touches them directly. Additionally, the
TO bearing is different than the old type TO that we all know and love.

My question is in regards to compatibility of the two systems.

In a pinch, if the pressure plate went bad, could I unscrew the sleeve,
replace the late-style TO bearing with my spare old style, and replace the
pressure plate with my spare old style, and be on the road again for the
long term?  Ditto question for the case of if the new style TO bearing
failed - could I do the above replacements? Could the old TO bearing run
on the sleeve and use the ring-less pressure plate?  What are the
compatibilities here?

Thanks,

cal
