Subject: To Buy or Not to Buy--65 Bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all. I'm pretty new to all this so bear with my questions :~). I'm 
considering buying a 65 Bus, and can't quite figure out what model it is. The 
VIN is 285097285. As far as I've checked, that comes up as a 7-seater 
sunroof, which this definitely is not. This is a Kombi camper conversion of 
some sort--but no louvered windows, all pop-outs. I wonder if anyone can help 
with this VIN mystery. I haven't seen the bus up close yet, so I'm going on 
pictures right now. Thanks...

Sue
