I was *amazed* at the reasonable rates he charged. You will burn out
if theres now money in what you are doing.

I know how to work on them. Ive worked on a lot of electronics.
Ive decided to fix my own Sapphire and quickly ended up working on 
another sapphire and  a friends tubed Blaupunkt. But I am sorry I just
dont want to make a business out of it.
Working on old stuff like that takes time and care. I would not 
work on stuff like this for a flat rate like Brad charged. And if I charge
$40 hour 
to restore an  old  radio it will be 150 and up for a repair.
Sorry to see him stop working a I had considered myself to send him
my old 3 band blaupunkt (hint hint).
