Subject: Poweder coating parts a home??

Anyone tried the home powder coating system like Eastwood and Harbour Freight
sell?  I want to powder coat some parts for the Bus, like handles westy
hardware (that hold the cabinets in) bumper steps and such.  Got a price to
have it done and it would be cheaper to buy one of these since most of the
parts fit in a toaster oven.
