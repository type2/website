John,

I will be heading out to see you tomorrow (Sat - 10/13) but don't have your 
phone number. Ronnie tells me that you are aware of this, but I wanted to 
confirm that. Please reply to this address with your telephone number so I 
can call you. I expect to get there around dinner time (-ish).

Thanks...
