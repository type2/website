Subject: Valve Spring Installation?
Date: Sun, 6 Feb 2000 00:24:39 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I started putting the valve springs on the heads tonight and realized there
are 2 ways the valve springs could be installed.  One end of the spring has
a few tightly wound coils and then the rest of the spring is pretty much
uniformly spaced.  Anyone know if it makes any difference which way the
springs are installed?

I also remembered to grind the valve keeper ends just a tad to make sure the
keepers were fully seated on the valve.

Later!
