Subject: Re: [VB] bumpers

Just an F.Y.I.: depending on how model-year correct
you want to be, you might want to get the &quot;pointed
end&quot; bumpers. That is, the blade ends come together in
a symmetrical point at the center of the end of the
blade. In earlier years (ending some time in 65?) the
lower edge of the bumper rises to meet the top end of
the blade, commonly referred to as &quot;slash end&quot;
bumpers.

Like I said, I'm not sure exactly what year they made
the switch. I've even seen an old 23-window bus ad
with a pointed end bumper on the front and a slash end
on the back.

But particularly on a deluxe, like you have, the
deluxe trims are different, to match the profile of
the bumper end. i.e. There are &quot;slash end&quot; trims and
&quot;symmetrical end&quot; trims.

But, if you aren't reallt a stickler for year/model
correctness, then the slash-end ones that WW sells
should do fine. 

Heck, you can even get out a welder and do up some
wicked diamond steel and two-by-four bumpers if that's
your thing.

&gt; I will be ordering bumpers this week for my 66
&gt; Deluxe and I am wondering where to order the best
&gt; repro ones at reasonable prices (unless Ronnie has a
&gt; couple of good used ones laying around.)  I plan to
&gt; salvage the deluxe trim off of the old beat up
&gt; bumpers.  Any recommendations or have any to sell?
