&gt; I'm wanting to attend the RMMW and Bandimere shows August 9th.   Can someone please confirm the dates for
&gt; me and give me directions to Bandimere from I-70?  
&gt; 

The RMMW show in Woodland Park, CO is on Saturday, August 8th, the big
show and swap are at Bandimere Speedway outside of Denver in Morrison is
on Sunday, August 9th.  I will post more this afternoon after I get some
info that is at my house.  

Something has come up that might prevent me from making my annual trek
south.
