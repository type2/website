Subject: New VA NEATO Chapter
Date: Thu, 10 Dec 1998 18:42:11 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Any listees interested in starting a new NEATO chapter in VA? I live in Va
Beach VA and already have about half a dozen people interested. I used to
have a chapter called &quot;Middle Eastern Bullis&quot; but we folded due to lack of
interest. I want to make this one work this time. Right now I'm planning on
having a meeting around the first part of Feb to vote on it and see if we
even have enough interest. I'll be sending a notice to all present NEATO
members in VA in the near future when I can get a list of all the members
from Tom in NM. If you are interested either e-mail me or give me a call at
(757)490-9650.
