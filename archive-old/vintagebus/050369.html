The other day I picked up a CO gastester. It was on sale for quite a 
reasonable price so I thought I'd add it to my inventory and see if 
it could help more accurately tune my bus.
I've read through the manual and I'm not quite sure I follow the procedure.

Try, I say, try to stay on the same page with me,
boy. (He's a good li'l fella, but it's like talkin' to a brick.)
&lt;/Foghorn Leghorn voice&gt;

I've calibrated the tester to 2 percent after a long warm up with 
both the tester and the bus, and when I take a reading I measure 1.6. 
So is my CO emission 0.4 (2 minus 1.6)?
I've been hunting around and can't find any information suggesting 
what CO levels I ought to expect from a 1200 with a 28 PICT carb. Any 
suggestions?
Glen
