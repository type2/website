&lt;&lt; I was droven down the autobahn to the 50 years of anniversery for the VW
 transporter in a sunny weather with about 95 km/h my oil temperature meter
 said around 117 C.
 The oil temperature meter stops at 120 C.
 If I drive longer south and it get's very sunny, I think my oil temperature
 meter will blow away.
 Is the oil getting to hot ?
 If NOT why this high temperature ?
 If YES what can I do to bring it down (the oil stick says that there are
 plenty of oil in the tank) ?
 I have heard that the oil temperature raise with about 10% if the windows
 are open, is that right ?
  &gt;&gt;

not sure what year bus, or what size motor.

yes I think 117C is too hot.  My temp guage is also in C, and I am happy with 
70 to 100 C.   above 100 I watch it, above 110 is too hot, at that temp oil 
degreades they say, and I believe them.  (read Bergs stuff on his website).

1.  I do a spit test, spit on motor if it sizzles and evaporates instantly, 
it is too hot.  if it sizzles a little it's okay.

2.  is your temp guage accurate?  remove it and place in boiling water to 
check.  water boils at 100 C.

3 of course, tune the bus up, this can help it runs better and cooler.  An 
old dist cap could be a problem.

4  how are your engine compartment seals- engine to body, around engine door, 
etc, holes plugged in tin?

5.  how you drive, there is an optimum cooling speed, try different speeds, 
stay at that speed for ten mins, then go 5mph faster.  how does your oil temp 
compare?  what may be fine to drive in the winter may make your motor too hot 
in summer.

hope this helps.  you also may want to change you gear oil and check/repack 
you front wheel bearings and make sure your brakes aren't dragging or 
sticking.  The doghouse cooler does cool better, and the typeIV doghouse even 
better.  Themostat flaps also help it cool better.

then again, the motor will run warmer in summer than winter no matter what, 
especially when it is hot and dry and you packed tons of stuff in your bus 
for a trip and your mottopr pushes all that up a hill.  Thus since you do 
have a temp guage, it is good to find the coolest driving speed for your 
motor, and let the speed demons pass.
