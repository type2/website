Hi Shedberg,
 As you increase the diameter of the carburetor venturi, intake, exhaust 
manifolds and valves, you have more and more flow metering problems at low 
RPMs due to too low of vaccum below the venturi.  To solve this you have to 
go to FI. 
&gt; 
&gt; As long as we are at it.  Why the loss of low end torque anyway?  Is this 
&gt; due to the more completely evacuated cylinder after the exhaust stroke 
&gt; having to &quot;work more&quot; on the subsequent downstroke?  Hence adding breathing 
&gt; 
&gt; up front to pack more in on the intake compression and burn cycle?

If you have too big of diameter muffler for the size of carburetor/engine, 
you vaccum the cylinders out, you vaccum out the intake manifold while both 
intake and exhaust valves are open.  This reduces the amount of air/fuel in 
the cylinder which in turn reduces the compression and HP and torque output.  
Kind of like finding out a tire on your VW is halfway flat.  So you deflate 
it all the rest of the way down and only reinflate it the half amount it 
needed in the first place to be full!
  We wish NQ was still on this list.  He built a bigger, big valve, 
non-stock, better breathing engine.  He ended up soon after taking it apart 
and asking fellow list members if they wanted the non-stock parts in trade 
for stock parts.
  Since the stocker muffler flow is just fine for at least up to 1641cc size 
and well over 4,000 RPM.  We are happy with better MPG, low end torque and 
about double engine longevity running 3,000 RPM as a cruising RPM.
