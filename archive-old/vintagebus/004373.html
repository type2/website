 Who cares about torque, go by feel and run with it. 33 or 34 or 35
BARNDOORS at OCTO, WHO CARES. There were over 350 splits there, 10% or less
BD's. If it were not for us &quot;other split bus drivers&quot; there WOULD BE NO
SHOW. Let Mark and the boys have a Barndoor only show and see who shows up,
the same group showing off their same Barndoors. Get off your BD pedestal
and enjoy the rest of the split buses. Sure they are rare and cool but
feature another model next year.  I have emailed Moe about this and he said
they would thank about it. Charlie has the right idea with all his
commercial buses, all years and all styles.
How about a panel or crewcab or singlecab or camper lineup next year?, with
the Barndoors mixed in like all the other buses.
Nothing against Barndoors ( I have owned one, a 54 DD panel and almost
bought the 53 BD walkthur in 91 from back east for the asking price of
$1875.00) and am trying to buy another 54 panel right now, but there are
other very nice split buses out there. No flames as I have asbestos skin by
now, just throwing out another idea. Like to get the list and others going.
Love my panel and it is not going to Japan, but staying in LHC with me. OCTO
and NEATO RULE !!!!!
