I just went out and found a cedar tree in the road ditch (they grow like
weeds around here)cut it down and put it up! I used to help my old land lord
clean apartments after people left and I got a box full of Christmas
decorations from one apt I cleaned out.  So I put them on the tree and they
look wonderful! Wish I had some splitty lights or ornaments, but these fill
me with cheer! Oh well I couldn't afford them anyway. Happy Holidays to all
[vb] members.

Thanks,
Kevin Sullivan
