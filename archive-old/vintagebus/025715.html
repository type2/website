Subject: Search for the owner of my 64 SC
Message-ID: &lt;378DF088.D4FE34FD_at_arts.greenville.k12.sc_dot_us&gt;

While I was checking out the Texas Type 2 Guy's web sight &quot;Thanks Rex&quot; I
read his story of the history of his 59 Kombi.
As mentioned it changed hands several times, to end back up in his
hands. Then another list member was searching for the very same bus that
he once owned, Neat Story! It got me to wondering if any one on the list
ever owned my 64 Single cab?

The SC is originally from New Mexico. It was painted Blue and White. It
had the rear wheel wells cut out. Inside panels where covered with a
heavy black cloth material. The one true giveaway would be the New
Mexico License plate cut and used as a Radio Speaker mount. This truck
was sold to Steve Martin from Beaver Pennsylvania in or around 1994-95.

If you think you might have owned this truck please pmail me with info.

Thanks
Meredith Murray
