 Got the best advice from Harry Houck on posting the pictures ( Harry,
advice worth at least a 30 pack of the Beast at BBBIV ). He said go to
www.egroups_dot_com and sign up. Never knew of this site or just blew it off.
Signing up and scaning pictures. Will be interesting to see some of your
coments after seeing my pictures.
