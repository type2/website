Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] window rubber?

tar? 
you'd think that with all this modern tchnology and marvel chemicals,
there's something better than tar. geez, if i break a window, i like to
re-use the rubber (if realistic to do so). plus, it must be a real b*tch to
clean up after using tar, especially if you mess up or want to change it
(like some of you who for some reason like safari's). i'd hate to pick all
those little tiny glass shards out of tar if i wanted to reuse a seal.
i've used vw window sealant with good success, as well as plain olde
permatex window sealant. the key is to put it in the channel that the
window sits in, as well as the outer grooves of the rubber AND on the body.
the bentley/vw manuals describe this process.
tar? (cringe)


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Yes, tar is the best way to not only seal the window seal to the body,
but 
&gt; the glass to the seal to prevent the white haze of water damage when
using 
&gt; laminate glass.  It also is great because it lubricates the seal when
being 
&gt; installed and repels rust!
