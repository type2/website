Subject: oil bath air filter id

i recently came across an oil bath air filter that i cant identify.  somebody
told me it was for an early ghia, but it looks like it would be for an early
bus.  the part # on it is 261 129 611A.  the lower part screws on instead of
attaching with the bail clips like the style im used too seeing.  any help
would be appreciated.  thanks!
josh
