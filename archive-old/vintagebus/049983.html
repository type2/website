Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Tank Grey Paint

Seems to me that the gas tanks (beetles also, but those were black of
course) and the engine sheet metal were painted in some sort of satin
finish or semi-gloss paint.  Maybe someone who is expert in paint
formulations can explain how to convert a regular gloss acrylic enamel to
something with less sheen?

&gt;I guess it depends on the AR factor.  I'm content to do mine in
&gt;Krylon &quot;Battleship Gray&quot; which is a little bit lighter, but adheres very
&gt;well.
&gt;
&gt;Go to the gas tank section of my howto page to see a comparison.

&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a good modern day source for the grey paint originally
&gt;&gt;used on the gas tanks?  Is it flat?  Seems to be, but then again flat
&gt;&gt;paint normally tends to show grease, oil stains and this paint doesn't
&gt;&gt;seem to do that, especially considering where it is.  Rather than search
&gt;&gt;through every paint store looking for something close, I thought I'd see
&gt;&gt;if someone else has done that leg work.
