Subject: Re: [VB]  1700 lb Kennedy Pressure plate (in)compatability ?

Hello Guys   I will not use these pressure plates in a bus.  They put too 
much pressure on the crosshafts and really give you no better performance than a 
stock plate. If you want to make it even better use a Rabbit diesel cltch 
disc. These were designed for more torque. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
