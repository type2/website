Subject: Re: [VB] '65 new tranny replacement saga

--Ted,

Was it a square head (with safety hole) set screw like on the baywindows?

Mine was totally missing, I have nothing to go on.

I bought 2 new M8 bolts to cut down, one 1.25 pitch and one 1.5.

Neither fit, but an old bolt laying in the back of the bus screwed right in!

Billy

IF you have a lathe any bolt can be turned ino the right one,just use an old one as a guide.
If there are recyclers around that have bugs the rear shift coupler to trans coupler has the same screw.
