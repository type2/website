&gt;The 1st ticket on the Jerome raffle bus was 900325, the lone person standing

the numbers and details are a little different, but uncle jerry can 
be forgiven for some blurriness in all the excitement! i was planning 
on zipping out as soon as the second number eliminated all my tickets 
(933xxx vs my tickets of 917xxx), but the drama was so good i 
stayed... there were actually TWO women standing at the end of the 
first drawing; an older hispanic woman and devon(?) who i believe is 
the daughter of the ABC VP. the hispanic woman had the ticket that 
was one number before the first drawn. her three (what looked like) 
sons looked very disappointed!!

the second round, devon looked ready to pass out - had she not won, i 
think she would have fainted. there was some grumbling behind me 
about the VP's daughter winning, but i witnessed BOTH tickets being 
drawn, and there was no fishiness - just random chance.  ya gotta 
fell REALLY bad for the guy who slept thru the raffle and missed 
winning... unless, of course, he was one of the idiots trying to ruin 
it for everyone all weekend :p
