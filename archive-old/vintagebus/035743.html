&gt;  &gt; remove the nasty soaked shoes, you need a new set.
&gt;  
&gt;  So.. I don't mean to sound dense, but the shoes don't look soaked.  I think
&gt;  this has been an ongoing slow leak, there wasn't any actual liquid (brake
&gt;  fluid), more like an accumulation of dampness and crud.  So ya, the shoes
&gt;  have some of this black crud on them in a couple places... Do I need to
&gt;  replace them?
&gt;

oh, I just had the impression there was a soaking leak.  If they are just a 
little damp, you can clean them off with brake cleaner.


&gt;  &gt; remove the piston from the wheel cylinders on that side (I put an oil pan
&gt;  &gt; under neath to catch the drips)   take a rag and a flashlight and look
&gt;  inside
&gt;  &gt; the cylinder.  okay, wipe the old fluid out so you can see better.  The
&gt;  &gt; cylinder should be nice and smooth- no pits./   Pits are bad.  if they 
are
&gt;  &gt; very slight you may be able to use a brake hone and rebuild the wheel
&gt;  &gt; cylinders, but if they are more than very slight you will need to buy new
&gt;  
&gt;  I can't see any sign of pits or grooves.  So I'm wondering about this
&gt;  rebuild kit idea.  Is this a VW-specific part or something generic?  The
&gt;  VWflaps in my area don't seem to carry them, at least they don't show up on
&gt;  the websites. (bow-wow and Cal Imports)  What does it contain exactly?  Is
&gt;  it just new rubber rings?  I'm just wondering so I don't sound like a total
&gt;  idiot when I call around on Monday... the parts places around here 
generally
&gt;  have staff that knows zero except for how to work the computer, so it can 
be
&gt;  kind of frustrating.

well, I am sure all sort of brakes have rebuild kits, but you want ones 
specifically to fit your VW's wheel cylinders.    Each kit contains one 
scraper ring to go one the piston, and one dust cap to keep crud from getting 
in there.   They should be cheap.  they are not always locally available, so 
you may have to mail order.    need one per cylinder I think, may be one per 
wheel.  hm, I forget

wheel cylinders have different inner diameters, and there are diff styles, 
even between old VWs.  right.  but some over lap.  The front wheel cylinders 
on a BD bus take the same rebuild kit as a 69 bug, which causes much less 
heads scratching and blank looks when you ask for it.
