&gt;I have never done this before. Muir says to use two scissors jacks and a
&gt;block of wood. Is it possible to use a floor jack?

Hey Brad,
I have found that a floor jack works great,just as long as you have the jack
propped under the engine stratigically.
I would suggest using a piece of plywood cut just a bit smaller than the
size of the motor and a 2x4 to put against the jack. Jack up the jack
untilyou have just enough tension to support the engine and start your
unhooking.
Just to be safe, after you have your engine pulled out,with the help of a
buddy,wife,girlfriend,neighbour,passerby or whatever,gently slide  the whole
thing,plywood and all onto a dolly or something preferably with wheels. Then
its easy to wheel the motor to your bench or wherever.
It worked good for me...
