 Assuming you can't find a pair of armadillos (I know they're
 endangered, but surely someone is still making them), I've had
 reasonable luck using heavy rubbery-plastic hose with a helical wire
 stiffener in it.  Got the stuff at a car parts place, but I have no
 idea what it's official purpose in life is (it certainly doesn't look
 like it was intended for handling liquids).  Get good hose clamps to
 go with it (and a sharp knife, if you don't already have one).

you can use ones out of a bug or late bus.   but if you use the plastic ones 
and you fan belt breaks and the dead belt whips your pass side fresh air hose 
to shreds the heater box there will get real hot and melt the plastic  heat 
tube to body.  It will reek, and you will have to stop and pull the hose off 
in the cold rain and snow.   This is why I like to use a plastic fresh air 
tube on the battery side of the engine compartment.    You can also use the 
flex tube stuff used as the fresh air hoses.  Duct tape helps.   unless you 
have a baffler in the tube, extra engine noise is sent to the inside of the 
bus.   I heard they were reproed, though.
