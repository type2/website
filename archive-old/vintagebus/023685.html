We have a lot of experience with restoring gates on single and double
cabs. Check out the latest (July-Vintage) issue of Hot VWs for an
example of our work on the Green '67 Single Cab. Certainly they are time
consuming, but not generally a problem depending on their condition. I
have a set of very nice gates for a double cab in stock for sale as
well.
Also, we are located in NORCAL, 20 miles east of Oakland near the
Benicia Bridge off of Hwy 680.
