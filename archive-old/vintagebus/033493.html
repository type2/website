Subject: RE: [VB] Buses by the Bridge NEWS FLASH 

Ronnie,
   There was some talk of relocating BBB to a different/better place 
nearby. Any changes for next year?

&gt; &gt;   Buses by the Bridge now has the possibility to be extended one day.
&gt; &gt;Looking at the 2002 calendar it turns out that January 21, 2002 is Martin
&gt; &gt;Luther King day, which is a holiday. So those of you that were worried
&gt;about
&gt; &gt;getting back home should not worry as it IS a Federal Holiday.
&gt;
&gt;Even in Arizona??? :)
&gt;
&gt;So, would you guys extend the show to Monday as well? Or leave that as a
&gt;travel day for those few of us that don't live in Havasu? Not that it
&gt;matters to me, I'll be there either way. That's a fun one. It's somewhere
&gt;between a show and a campout and a swap. It has the best of all three
&gt;without the negative parts of any.
