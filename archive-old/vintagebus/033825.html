 I'm planning to by a 21 window deluxe.
 I've seen the bus today, but still have some question about missing (?)
 parts.
 
 
 Are the bumpers on a deluxe the same as on other splitties ?
 (I know they have extra trim on them, but are they the same shape, ...)
 =  == = 
yes, same except for thr deluxe get trim
-  -- -  
 About that trim :
 Everything is with the car, but i noticed that the bolts to attach it to the
 bumper are broken.
 Is it possible to fit new bolts ?
=  == 
yes  if in front and they are broken off in the bus it is fun to drill them 
out, but possible
 ------------------
 The only things missing from the trim are the 2 pieces that are fitted on
 each side of the bus (underside)
 I haven't seen holes for them. Can it be that this splittie never had those
 ?
=  ==  
deluxes came with them.  3 or 4 small holes each side.  if the rockers are 
rusty that is why you can't se the holes.
 -------------------
 The number on the motor starts with F.
 Can this be the original motor ?
 1500cc ?
 = =  =
no, its a 66 bug case.  look in the back of your Muir Idiot book for engine 
numbers to chassis numbers
-  -- - - - - 
 In front there are to single seats.(for one person)
 And no, it's not a walk-thru.
 Is this normal ?
 =  == = 
a 65 bench seat would have a separate drivers seat that slides on a track.  
the passenger side is 2/3 width (twicw as wide as the drivers seat), and does 
not adjust.  if someone stuck a one person seat on the pass side there it is.
======
 The seats in the back are missing.
 Is it still possible to get those things for a reasonable price ?
=  == 
well, um, not neccessarily  people may want a lot of a middle seat if you can 
find on.  The back seat back on the deluxe is supposed to have a luggage bar 
on it, and the frame has special pieces fro these to attach.   the bottom of 
the back seat has to have legs that dont hit the heat log.   splittys are 
like this, but late bays have the center leg positioned wrong.  I think 68/69 
bay rear seats will work.

 Also most of the interior panels are bad or missing.
 possible to find ? price ?
= = = = 
used random- you can buy interior panels repro from TMI that are very nice 
for what $600 or $700 a set.
- -  - - -
 
 I've noticed some &quot;jail-bars&quot; at the side windows but not on the back
 window.
 Is this normal ?
 =  == 
no- the back window should have them as well as the rear most window on each 
side.  the there are not screw holes for the ends, then I would think the 
back hatch was replaced.

but hows the rust?   sunroof stuff all there?
