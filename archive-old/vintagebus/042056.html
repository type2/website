Think about it from VW's point of view.  They want to sell modern
watercooled cars.  To do so they use a bit of nostalgia for their antique
models in their advertising.  However, don't mistake a few advertising
photographs for an appreciation of their history.  In fact, VW would just
as soon lose that part of their history that reminds potential customers
of underpowered, poorly heated, noisy vehicles driven by hippies.  The
last time I saw a VW bus in a automobile ad, the ad was for a _H*nda_!
It contrasting the Neandertal bus with H*nda's latest technomobile.  

&gt; I get the 
&gt; same treatment as you guys on not only my pre 1977 vws, but my 81 rabbit as 
&gt; well, and the parts guy at my local VW is a real cork screw of a jerk, he 
&gt; wouldnt fit in at any parts store (or anyplace that he had to come in 
&gt; contact with public society)

I think that you may have committed the sin of working on your own car.  I
sense that some dealers attempt to make the experience of working on your
own car as unpleasant as possible so that you will bring it to their
professional mechanics next time.  It also seems that they perceive anyone
driving a car more than 10 years old to be depriving them of their new-car
income, and therefore beneath contempt.

OTOH, there are dealers and parts folk who are a credit to their
profession in their helpfulness and knowledge.  Unfortunately, my local
dealer isn't in this catagory, since they have never sold an air-cooled
car.
