&gt;   I have been in contact with Chriss about making the wheels again and 
&gt; he
&gt; has been busy with his real business. I have asked him to PLEASE make 
&gt; wheels
&gt; again, as he still has the molds and maybe when he sees this thread he 
&gt; might
&gt; consider it again.


Have I missed a message or two in this thread?  I didn't see an 
important question asked or answered:

How much does Chris sell his wheels for?
