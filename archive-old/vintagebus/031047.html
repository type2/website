Nick,

One more check that I know a lot of people here use.  Could you hold your
dipstick after a good long drive???  If so, I'd think again about your
&quot;overheating&quot; problem.

I'm going to go against the grain here and upset all the GB faithful and say
I'd suspect the &quot;temp-a-stick&quot;.

I have one of these things and like you after rebuilding my motor (stock
1600 DP with dog house and no flaps..then) thought it would be a good idea
to put one on, seeing how they were cheep and so highly touted.   Well, with
that thing I couldn't drive the freeway for 30 minutes with out it coming on
and flickering.  This was with driving at about 62-64 mph (stock big nut and
205 15&quot; tires...I don't have a tach) and about 70 degrees ambient temp!   I
checked everything and to no avail.

I finally got around to putting a cyl head temp. and oil temp. gauges on the
motor to get some numbers (as skeptical as some say those can be).  Well the
damm thing has NEVER ran oil over 210 and cyl. temp. stayed at 700 all the
time I've been running it with the gauges (up to 100 degrees ambient).

I guess what I'm saying is not to trust ONE gauge.  corroborate it with
another verified source...one you know to be correct.  Sometimes you
discover you really don't have a problem at all.

I think the stick temp gauge is a good thing...just not sure how to verify
if it is correctly calibrated.

&gt; ok heres the scoop....
&gt;
&gt; i have a new mexico 1600dp with a type 4 oil cooler.
&gt; when i put oil in 2.5 quarts filled it to the top mark.
&gt; i have a gene berg dip stick sensor. i coldent drive
&gt; more than 5 miles without the light coming on.
&gt;
&gt; now all my tin is correctly installed all my seals are
&gt; in place. my timing is set a 7.5 btc. nothing is in my
&gt; fan either, now here are my questions.
&gt;
&gt; 1. since i have a bigger oil cooler should i pour in
&gt; more oil? and if so how much more?
&gt;
&gt; 2.if i have to put in more oil should i just put in a
&gt; deep sump?
&gt;
&gt; 3.since its a 59. type 2 and it originaly had a 40 horse
&gt; the vents on the side arent big enough?
&gt;
&gt; 4. if the vents arent big enough should i put in air
&gt; scoops?
&gt;
&gt; oh and it was a about 90-95 degrees f. outside but i
&gt; wasnt able to go more than 3-5 miles.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; nick aragon
