To this day my wife still thinks my buses are ugly, to the point where she
doesn't really like riding in them (maybe if I cleaned them, it would help)
but she really liked the &quot;NEW&quot; microbus? Just another concept that will sell
for 1000's over sticker to the yuppie gen x crowd who will be crying the
blues in 2 years when they can't sell it for what they still owe on it. It's
pretty bad when you can find 98 new beetles on car lots and the net for sale
for 10,000 dollars (or less) that were bought new for 26 g's plus! But just
think!!! buy a &quot;NEW&quot; microbus put it on blocks and sell it for a huge profit
in 30 or 40 years! Even better, start buying up all the replacement parts
and have a killer stash of NOS bus parts in 40 years.

yeah it may not be what we wished it would be but lets
not be afraid of somthing diffrent. the early bus
probably looked as ugly then to people when it first
came out but we see the beauty in it now, maybe the
new bus will do somthing like the new beetle did for
the older ones much more accepted....who knows maybe
people wont be flicking us off because we are moving
to slow they just might understand.no i wont waste my
money on the new bus but lets not totally reject it.
