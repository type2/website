&gt; I'm thinking of putting safaris in my 54 Single Cab.  Is anyone familiar
&gt; with the repros that I've heard are out there for a barndoor? If so, what do
&gt; you think of them?   Is it better to hold out and search for an original VW
&gt; set of barndoor safaris?

A couple things:

BD safars are vastly different than normal ones.  The rubber runs in a channel
on the outside like a side popout, and they attach with two big tabs up top
with bolts thru the top of the windsheild header.

Some people cut down normal safaris and mount them.  I think this is hokey.
You did know that BD windshields are ~1 1/4&quot; shorter than normal 
windshields.  Of course you did.

Safaris leak.  Anywhere above redding,, CA, don't bother.

There's a place in England, something like &quot;Creative Engineering&quot; which is 
supposed to be making repros BD safaris.  Last time I checked they 
were ~$1200 US.  THere was a guy in the US making them, by modifying popouts,
or so I heard, but I also heard the attention to detail wasn't what it could be.

I have a strong lead on some which I want to put in my '54 RHD deluxe
when the time comes.

I think RVB has them on his ambu-westy.  Contrary to popular opinion, arizona
is not the driest place on earth.  that title belongs to dry valley in
antartica.  the only place you can use safaris and a gas heater at the same time!
