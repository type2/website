Subject: Re: [VB] Carlsbad VW show this weekend
References: &lt;34.1455321a.281a18f5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'll be there in a way ugly baby poop tan '61 Sub hatch westy.  It is the SV2's show at Bob Baker Volkswagen in Carlsbad.  I don't know that I'd call it a little show, it pulls some
quality talent.  They clear out the show room and the entire front lot for us, and we fill it with Vintage VWs.  The showroom is filled with some of the oddities of the Vw makes.
Last year there was a Heb in the show room along with a couple other models.  I've heard rumors that they were trying to get a Rometesh (sp?) this year and a couple other models that
haven't been in the show room before.  As far as busses, the Sv2's will all be there, as well as many others, it is a fun show.  Plus, the Carlsbad Flower fields are just down the
road, and usually in full bloom this time of year.  My girlfriend actually enjoys this show, because we can go get fresh produce at the little stands on the side of the road, and we
go to the flower fields after the show.

Later,
Aaron
