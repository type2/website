&gt;As time... marches... on... (I hate that phrase), I notice, more and
more,
&gt;how less and less there is which defines the number of qualified
vintage bus
&gt;mechanics at a given locale for those of us who love the bus but need a
&gt;professional for those unseemly occasions where said bus pilot has
exhausted
&gt;all his/her clues.

That, and much more.

I've had my '67 Deluxe since the 1970s, watched as the local VW dealer
became lost in the alphabet soup of  acronyms and Japanese brands and
have pretty much had to deal with doing everything myself.  I've been
fortunate to have the luxury of a daily driver for transportation while
I explore the inner workings of  the bus my kids grew up in.  The owner
of the local independent shop retired.  His son and their mechanic have
a clue, but not the experience.  They're now referring air-cooled
customers to me for parts and advice.

A few years ago several northern Illinois bus owners showed up at my
farm for an overdue maintenance party of sorts.  Split window buses
littered the barnyard concrete as one would adjust valves, the other
would renew transmission and reduction gear lube.  We'd get through the
simple stuff and reach a point where a puzzle needed a solution.  That's
when it dawned on us.  We were the experts.  At least the local experts.
 There was no nearby performance shop, no VW dealer looking for us in
the service bay and maybe a few independent shops who knew what
air-cooled meant.  It was down to us and we were a pretty sorry looking
group.

A few years ago a Vanagon owner was referred to me by someone at work. 
The kid had an oil leakage problem and his mother said the van would
have to go (no oil spots on HER driveway!) or be fixed.  It just needed
pushrod tue replacements.  I went to the service counter at the
Authorized VW Service place and talked with the guy behind the counter. 
Mind you, this was an '84 Vanagon, not that old.  He had no clue what I
was talking about.  Pushrods?  And you say there's tubes around them?

It wasn't too long after that I found bus lists online, before the
Vintage, Type2, Vanagon split-up.  Hey! There are other folks out there
with the same problems, the same mindset!  It's different than sitting
around an oil-soaked garage exchanging ideas on smoothing out the idle
with a screwdriver in one hand and a beer not too far away.  I prefer a
bottle of wine, but that's another story.

Here in cyberspace the smell of tranny lube doesn't permeate everything.
 The questions, advice, suggestions, trials-and-errors, kidding, bad
ideas and sympathy are still there.  We do have one advantage which
makes up for the face-to-face camaraderie.  That's the archives.

Who stops to record the wisdom or stupidity revealed on a late summer
night in a garage with the door open?  It passes.  The bus either comes
to life or doesn't, but the magic of two old farts puttering around with
tools and a trouble light doesn't get videotaped or photographed or
written down until it's retold in a forum like this.

Still, it takes considerable effort to wade through the bullsh*t to find
a hint worth pursuing or a bright idea worth trying, a place to get that
elusive part, how to rebuild a light switch or just to laugh at
ourselves.  We leave a rolling legacy.  So keep it up, keep the bull to
a minimum, pass whatever vice you prefer to the next outstretched hand,
and pray for a tailwind.
