Message-ID: &lt;374E679E.B80ACA9B_at_SOLdesign_dot_com&gt;

thanks thom for that generous offer... since it's friday now i think i
will expand...

i initially wrote that i acquired a 66 kombi... well, i tore out the
funky wood interior that one of the PO's did... somebody please tell me
why he put R-11 insulation in there... the cargo floor and the floor
above the engine compartment are rusted all to hell... i couldn't hold
back the tears... 

i happened to be going to take my mom out to lunch one afternoon and saw
a 66 in a lien yard... needless to say i got the info and went to try
and bid on it... i got beat out for $150 (didn't know it was cash only),
but the guy called me the next day and said i could have it for what he
paid... thus came my problem with trying to store another bus... but it
was a walk through... and other than parts of the cargo and passenger
floors... in much better condition... 

one question i had about the kombi... it has trim with it... i thought
the trim came on deluxes only... or is this just another option?  here
is the m-codes i got, but there didn't seem to be too many that were
available on the type2_dot_com library... any help is greatly appreciate... thanks.
