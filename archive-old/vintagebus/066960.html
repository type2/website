Subject: Re: 4mm tap source

&gt;From: Thomas Boyd &lt;meyra21_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Anyone have a source for a 4mm tap?  Home Depot only goes down to 6mm
&gt;and Lowe's doesnt have squat.

Try a True Value hardware store or possibly an Ace.  Home Depot and
Lowe's are not hardware stores.  Around 8 years ago, my Dad and I were
searching for an 8mm tap for his Bug and it went like this:

     Home Depot: &quot;Metric?  Huh?&quot;
Builders Square: &quot;No, we don't have any metric taps.&quot;
     True Value: &quot;Sure.  You want regular or fine pitch?&quot;

One way to find a good hardware store is to ask somebody who owns a
50+-year-old house where they buy hardware.

Another possibility is Harbor Freight tools.  I know they sell sets of
taps and dies that are inexpensive and I think they sell individual
pieces.  The quality may not be real great but for chasing threads,
as opposed to cutting new threads in hard steel, it's probably OK.
