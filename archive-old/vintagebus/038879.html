My 67 has an after market emblem with threaded studs that fasten with wing nuts.
I used a wire grommet in the hole to help seal out the rain

My 63 has the original emblem with non threaded studs. I've used a small piece
of fuel line to fasten it.  But this week I ordered the emblem clips from
Wolfsburg West, however they don't carry or reproduce the seals, I know that
there were seals of some sort because remnants still remain stuck in the yellow
paint. 

what have other people done to deal with this and don't tell me roofing tar.

for those that live in arid climates and don't know what rain is or what window
wipers are for pmail me back and I'll send you a photo
