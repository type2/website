&gt; Why bother with all that and just install two 40amp relays  and a fused #8

Hi Ted,
When you do all that cleaning and soldering for the head lights you also 
increase voltage to turn signals, wipers, ignition, starter solinoid, 
E-blinkers, etc., etc....  Otherwise one would have to install many, many 
more relays, and complete removal of the stock fuse box to get the same job 
done.
