 was writ:

Hello, someone please tell me what a hoover bit is! I cracked a little L

shaped piece of metal that bolted to my cooler last time I changed the

cooler seals. Is that a hoover bit? Is it important? Thanks!

BAck in the days of yore, there was vanagon_at_lentil.soup_dot_com.

A list for all box shaped VWs

And this list was blessed by a guru Hoover

who spake of the L shaped deflector bracket for the doghouse cooler , that no 
one had known of

And Hoover proclaimed long about this L shaped deflector bracket for the 
doghouse cooler , and how the  L shaped deflector bracket for the doghouse 
cooler  was important for keeping the cooling air going through the cooler, 
rather than around.

And people didn't want to say &quot; L shaped deflector bracket for the doghouse 
cooler &quot; so they called it the Hoover bit

so, the idea is to keep that  L shaped deflector bracket for the doghouse 
cooler together, get it welded together or something.  It does help.
