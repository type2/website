Subject: re:binding door hinge



My door on my 60 single cab also stresses out when I close it....have to
really
slam it in fact. I discovered that the top hinge was actually bent and
slightly
cracked. One person felt it could be welded, but I don't think that's
the best
solution. Replacement, obviously, is the best option. I think maybe a
strong wind
caught the door at some point and over-extended it. Anyone know where
hinges can
be had and are they easy to replace? I've heard the horror stories of
backing
plates falling down into the bowels of the bus, never to be seen
again....any
ideas?
    Thanks!
