Subject: Re: [VB] no brakes

Don,

Pardon the stupid question, but you didn't mention bleeding the brakes at all.
DId you bleed them and still have nothing?

&gt; In my 65, the pedal went all the way to the floor when I bought it.  Bone

&gt; accomplishes nothing.  Underneath, from the outside, all components are
&gt; attached, and appear to be ding their job.  I plan on re-doing the whole

&gt; ability to roll it in and out of the garage for now.  Any thoughts
&gt; appreciated
