&gt; Okay.....the bus has been running great since this spring other then minor
&gt; brake adjustments....
&gt;
&gt; Driving home Sunday late at night and about 7 miles from home ......
started
&gt; to slow down for a stop light and put the clutch in. Omnious snapping
sound
&gt; and pedal turns loose but still functions. The clutch cable is starting to
&gt; go and the spare is in the bus... so fine. Made it home by minimzing
&gt; shifting and timing the stop light sequence plus as bonus got to watch the
&gt; Canada Day fireworks from 5-7 miles out from the city park. (It's the
plains
&gt; out here, folks..... nothing to obstruct the view!!!!!)
&gt;
&gt; Replace the cable the next day and find one strand left on the broken
cable.
&gt; Reached the point in the repair where the cable wing nut had to go on the
&gt; new cable and of course the cable is just showing 1-2 threads at the
&gt; throw-out arm. You can only access this by one hand and you can't see.
&gt;
&gt; Gave up for a bit........ got a bungee cord hooked around the the clutch
&gt; throw-out bearing arm and stretched it forward to hook onto a chassis
part!!
&gt; The wing nut went on in 5 seconds and problem solved!!!!
&gt;
&gt; The broken cable...... my fault. I put too much bend in the bowden
tube....
&gt; probably 1.5 to twice as much as required because I took the measurement
&gt; wrong from the workshop manual.
&gt;
&gt; Now I've got it right and need to get another spare cable.
