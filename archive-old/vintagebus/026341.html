Scott,

What type of paint system are you going to use.  I think you do it
differently if you are using single stage versus a two stage base coat/clear
coat finish.  Make sure you make your line with 3M Fineline tape!

Check this site out.  It's BBS is full of just paint information.  The
admin. is Len Stuart and he can answer ANY question you will have.

Also check the archive.  I know the question has been asked before...maybe
not about a bus though.

&gt; I'm getting closer to being able to put the paint on the double cab and
&gt; am looking to find out the best procedure for masking the two paints.
&gt; Upper half will be the original light gray and lower half will be L337
&gt; blue-gray.
&gt;
&gt; the dividing line will be at the lower edge of the rib that runs the
&gt; length of the truck and makes the distinctive splitty front end.
&gt;
&gt; Do I mask off the bottom, paint the top and then reverse?
&gt;
&gt; paint the top, then mask it off and paint the bottom not worrying about
&gt; the over spray?
&gt;
&gt; How long should I wait before I put masking tape on fresh paint?
&gt;
&gt; Any other comments or suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Scott
