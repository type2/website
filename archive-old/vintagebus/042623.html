&gt; I'm not trying to steal anyones bus here. I didn't know all this was set up..I
&gt; did know you were INTERESTED though..nothing else.  so I pounced on the deal as
&gt; it is very near by.  I have had some VERY attractive offers ..ie 67 westy in
&gt; maine for a good price...but can not get out to maine or even travel anywhere
&gt; for this.

i have offered compromises, and you didn't like any of them.  All of them
involved you getting the bus and me some of the parts.  Yes, i wanted some
of the good parts, but i think in a compromise both sides loose a little
and both sides gain a little.  I pay half, loose the bus, gain some
stuff. You loose some stuff but gain the bus.  Fair.

&gt; I just wanted to clear things up.
&gt; Please don't publicly insult me.  In my book, THAT is bad karma.

i have insulted no-one.  I am merely relating what happened.  I am sorry
if you took it as an insult, but the situation is at it is.

&gt; anyways...how far away are you? there are PLENTY of buses in between here and
&gt; there I'm sure.  just look.  I had to.

i have driven hunderds of miles repeatedly to find a split i like.  If you
are insinuating that i havent been looking you are wrong.  Search the
archives for &quot;christine&quot; and read about one of my adventures.

as i have said, stepping on another persons deal is bad karma,  do what
you will and enjoy.

i wish you all the best,

Steve

p.s. i will post no more to the list on this, sorry to waste the
bandwidth. please direct flames to me, i probably deserve them as i have
lost my cool a bit over this.
