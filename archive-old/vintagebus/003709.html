          You hit it on the head &quot;if the Archive is working&quot;.  I tried to
doa  search last night on a 2.0 liter question and it wasn't working.


     Thanks all for the help.  I've ask a ton of questions in the past nad
well probaly have more.

    I bought the 66 that I ask about back in Oct 00.  The he wanted $800 for
it.  I got it for $500, hope I got a fair deal.  I'll post it on my page
shortly.

Dave
