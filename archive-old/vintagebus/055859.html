Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

VW did put mech advance in the T3 with FI. It was a combined mech advance
and vacuum advance. Does anybody know why they didn't follow this scheme on
the FI busses?

&gt; &gt;Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently
common]
&gt; &gt;009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;...david
&gt; note that vw DID NOT put mech advance in anything after a 25hp or so as
&gt; stock... more from a 'driver friendly' reason than any other. i assume the
&gt; old birds in the vw shops knew how to properly time for 'em.
