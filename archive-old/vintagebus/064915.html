Subject: Pile o' Crap Dbl Cab. - I respect the truth!

Gawd, I like seeing the truth posted in plain sight. No over priced, fresh from
Europe bullchid. No title, no tranny no engine no rear wheel wells, no problem?
Forget the wheel wells and get a bonded title and drive it. Who cares. Give
this guy a case of beer or a couple of fresh buds and I'm sure that you could
come up with a POS rolling tranny enough to get it home. $650. for a starter
just before the start of WWIII? Hell yeah! There seems to be alot of fairly
cool vehicles on the market for reasonable prices. I'd jump on this ASAP. Good
luck to you and tell the wife that at least she'd know where you are for a
change if you bought this.

Good luck to buyer and seller. Here's to realistic pricing!
