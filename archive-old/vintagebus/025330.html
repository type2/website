Just to note, my '66 westy has the sticker to the left of the
steering column that says &quot;12 volt&quot; with the lightening bolt.  Of
course Ive seen these as reproduction, but knowing some of the
history of this bus, I believe this '66 was  a 12v  from birth.  Was
this an option, or did they get an early start with mine?  Maybe I
have the very first 12v bus in the world.  Talk about &quot;rare&quot; ;)

&gt; &gt; Out of curiosity, do early model year 67 busses have 6v or 12v?

&gt; 12 V started at the very beginning of model year 67 as standard
&gt; equipment in Busses.
