&gt; My spare sits behind the left rear roller cabinet on the cargo area above 
&gt; the engine in my bus.  There is no spare tire well in the back... there is 
&gt; a gas heater in the 2nd battery tray so it would get in the way.   
&gt; Also...no bulkhead.  It never had one (flip seat)

Hi Isaiah,
That is a problem with the dealer installed Stuart and Warner gas heaters in 
walkthru buses they cut out the well and bolted in a plate.  Plus all Flip 
Seat SO-34 &amp; 35 were built on a walkthru front seat.....

  Also...no bulkhead.  It never had one (flip seat)
