Pardon my Georgia roots but I would have to say the best would be The Allman
Brothers &quot;Live at the Filmore East&quot;.

But then Bob Dylan 1966 Concert at Lord Alfred Hall would also rank pretty
good.  I know both are different types of music, but that being said I guess
there are different types of moods as well.

I also have an Allison Kraus bootleg that makes one's soul smile even on a
weary day.  Bluegrass that kicks ya in the ass and says &quot;Wake up you fitful
fool and fill your head with light-hearted air&quot;.

Just a humble 40 somethigns opinion of course.

Charlie
