Subject: intake leak

My 1600 SP has  a pernicious intake leak on the 3/4 head... I can see that
the manifold is cocked about 1/16&quot; towards the head, as opposed to flush
with the seat . I have loosened all the studs and worked the dang thing
back and forth, to and fro, hither and yon. I even took a pipe and tried
using it as a pry bay to flex the manifold out a bit. No dice, I still get
a sucking sound to a greater or lesser degree. On the other hand, the thing
idles wonderfully w/ all the extra air :P
Does anyone have any other tricks to try before I am forced to drop the
beast, dismantle it and take a broomstick to the manifold to bend it well
and properly?
