Subject: Error in the Tom Wilson rebuild book...

I just got the following email:
===================================================
Hi NQ,

I was browsing the type2 list from the web (egroups_dot_com) looking for
help and I noticed a post indicating you were once in the same boat as
I now find myself in!  I'm hoping maybe you can provide some advice.
I'm in the process of rebuilding my bus motor and am just about done.
I've been primarily using the Wilson book and specifically used it to
orient the dizzy... basically straddle the bottom case seam with the
two dots on the crank gear, dot on the can gear fits between and rotor
points  to the notch on the distributor body... hmm.  Well, when I did
it I thought, this makes no sense, the rod for #1 is in mid throw,
nowhere near TDC.  But, I decided okey dokey, who am I to question
Doc. Wilson?  Well, now that I've built the engine up to the valve
train I *know* that what he describes is just plain wrong.  Hence, my
search and up pops your message.  I'm guessing you were using Wilson
too ;-).  Did you pull the gear and reorient?  If so, how?  My biggest
nightmare is trying to do this and losing those shims at the bottom of
the gear in the case.  Following is your message to jog your memory.
If you have any suggestions, please respond directly to me as I'm not
currently described to the list.........................
===================================================

The reason I bring this up is I had the exact same problem.  The book is
either vague or wrong in this area and it has caused yet another VW engine
rebuilder to make a mistake.  I think the problem deserves correcting - does
anyone have any thoughts on this?
