Subject: heads up - yard sale :)

&gt;All,
&gt;Last weekend I came upon a VW shop w/hundreds of old Vdubs sitting around &amp;
&gt;a big &quot;commercial property for sale&quot; sign out front. I wandered through the
&gt;yard, taking pictures. Looking at the pictures I can count 30 type IIs, from
&gt;splits to vanagons, 14 of them campers. The building is a huge rambling
&gt;affair, just chock full of partially finished  Vdubs &amp; parts, mostly used.
&gt;I don't know what will happen to all this stuff when the property is sold,
&gt;but I have a bad feeling the crusher is waiting.
&gt;I have no connection to the place, I'm just a gear-head Vdub fan passing on
&gt;the info to anyone who might need parts or a project, while they are still
&gt;there.
