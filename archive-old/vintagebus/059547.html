Subject: RATS!

Volks,

Muh 20 year old just called me.  He has been using my '74 Burnt Orange =
&quot;Phoenix Red&quot; Bug that I restored back in 1990, because his '97 Buick =
Skylark won't pass emissions.  He just blew a rod through the side of my =
1600 dual port.

RATS!  I do have the old 1600 dp out of my bus when I put in the 1835 =
Bergmann.  But still, the thought of it!  Now we have to fix up the old =
1600, I am sure it needs new rear main seals.  It leaked oil like a sieve. =
 It could have been the dog house cooler though.

sympathy, anyone?
