Subject: Self-Tapping Cylinder studs???

Hey Y'all,
This is almost a re-post, almost.  I got some info
from Mark Dearing and Phil Cain last week about
self-tapping cylinder studs. Unfortunately, I lost
that info and I need some additional info. 
Background: 66 bus 1600 SP engine belonging to a
friend. In Helping her with valve adjustment I found 2
cylinder studs stripped on the case side.  Mark and
Phil told me there were self-tapping cylinder studs
that I could use. Here are the addtional questions:  I
can only find the 10mm self-tapping studs in catalogs,
so do the 10mm SELF-tapping studs replace the 8 mm
studs??  I am assuming that this engine has 8mm studs.
 Also, I see 2 different lengths, I am assuming for
top\bottom studs, but I can't find whcih size goes
where.  The stripped studs are the ones INSIDE the
valve cover, under the rocker arms, these are the
BOTTOM studs, right??  ARe the bottom studs the longer
or the shorter of the two???

Peace, John Baker
