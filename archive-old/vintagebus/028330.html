NQ,

It is indeed a 356/912 pulley.  The unfortunate part is that all 3 pieces are
usually sold separately.  Not all that cheap, but will last forever when taken
care of.  Don't forget to get a smaller belt also.  I seem to remember running a
9.5 x 895 or 890.

&gt; Bergmann's solution to the problem is to run &quot;Porsche&quot; pulley on the
&gt; generator.  The pulley is smaller and increases the air flowing over the
&gt; engine at any given speed.  A call to Bernie confirmed this.  He said your
&gt; cooling problems will be solved with a deep sump and Porsche pulley.  Then
&gt; he dropped the bombshell and said something along the lines of taking a
&gt; couple days to order it and then shipping it UPS ground blah blah blah.
