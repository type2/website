Well, I hope to be there, but I will probably be in my '55 Ch_at_vy Panel Truck 
w/ the flatbed trailer on the back after transporting a DD panel out to 
Monterey.  Let me know if anybody needs a bus transported.  Buy something at 
the Red Barn, and I could get it as far east as Phoenix or Flagstaff!

Probably camping in a tent on my trailer
