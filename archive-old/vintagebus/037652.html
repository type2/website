I agree with the &quot;Porsche people,&quot; we been using SEWPCO in our 
off-road race cars for over 20 years and haven't had any problems yet, 
and that is using everything from a type 1 IRS to a type 2 IRS to a 
Hewland.  The proof is in the pudding...I'll stick with SWEPCO.

Changing to SwepCo 201 has made it much easier to get into first, although 
I still get the steel wall every now and then, but I'll hazard it's 90% 
better.  Getting into 2nd and 3rd is much easier as well.  Porsche people 
swear by swepco.  The swear *at* redline MTL.
