&gt; In all reality if my memory serves me right it was #!$% MAD MAN MUNTZ. I'm
&gt; almost positive he was the pioneer of the four track decks, I remember
going
&gt; to his store over 31 years ago to pick up my new 4 track deck after I kept
&gt; scratching the 45 records on my under dash record player, I think his
&gt; downfall was the big screen TV, this MAD MAN was way ahead of the times.
I'm
&gt; not a good web search guy but MUNTZ logo was as memorable as Felix the Kat
&gt; or was that Fritz the Cat, oh my poor memory!
