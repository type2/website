My wife just walked in to help me finish loading for the Classic weekend and
in her hands she had a box, low and behold she bought me a AC/DC 9&quot; color
TV/VCR, now I can lie in bus and watch VW videos to lull me to sleep and
help me have pleasent dreams. Ah yes, camping in style.

see you all this weekend

ronnie

ps. now if I could only get her to buy me a 12  volt ice maker, then I'd be
set.
