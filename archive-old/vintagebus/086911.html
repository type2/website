I have no idea about these, but they sure look nice!  Any idea of the
history of these?

 

------------------------------

I have been looking for a LOOOONNGG time in search of a matching pair.  I
cannot remember where I found these two.  I have one other but the logo is
an &quot;X&quot; not VW , so there is another variation. They just barely fit a bus
because they are not very deep.  &quot;Bessie&quot; my bus loves them, but as for now
there is just two on one side

Hopefully my quest one day will be fulfilled, Bless you all and thanks, uj
