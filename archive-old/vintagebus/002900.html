&gt;He didn't convert it to an upright, but made a rear apron and kept the
stock fan and used &gt;a progressive carb.  I think he also fabricated a rear
hanger for the motor too.  It was &gt;pretty slick.
&gt;FWIW, he said he was pleased with the results, but that he would never do
it again or &gt;recommend it to anyone.  It might have been because he also
went to (had to?) an IRS &gt;bus tranny.  There was something about the
conversion that turned what he was hoping &gt;would be straight forward swap
into a nightmare.

It should also be noted that by not converting it to upright, he could not
run a decklid on the thing because the standard T4 fan housing stuck out too
far.  Surely not a good situation for any type of bus...

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
