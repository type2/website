Still working on a fan shroud . . 

The hardest part of this thing was getting it clean
inside . .

I have a few words to say about clean . . :-)

That oil was soaked into the pores of the steel . .

In the sink twice, the car wash 3 times  . . I finally
borrowed this horses watering dish and boiled the sucker
for 24 hours in TSP  . .

Don't worry about the horse . . dummy thinks I'm his new pal
brought him a present  when I brought it back . .  :-)

So what is clean ? that's the biggy here  . . :-)

When you can run water over it and it does not bead or
seperate . .

I don't mind eating off the plates in your house, 
but they're not clean enough to paint or plate . .

Use distilled or de-ionized water for the test . .
You don't need the effluvia they pump into your house 
on the parts either . . fish do nasties . . power boats
little kids in DIAPERS . . . . !

Now if you leave your clean part sit there for an hour 
and come back and do the water test again, it will fail . .

Never mind looking for the source of this contamination,
it's what you breathe . . 

One example is the jet planes in the sky above you . .
They pump thousands of tons of fuel thru those engines
every day . .

Even if you give them full due for efficiency . . no pilot
likes to climb off the ground with a lean engine . .

Just like us huh . . ?   :-)

Anyway there's all these hydrocarbons and jet fuel(raw) 
sprinkling down above you all the time . .

So it's the car we speak of . . yes, cover it . . 
then just before you use the tack cloth, wipe it down 
with rubbing alcohol . . take both dirt and oil off . .

The tack cloth is to pick up all the lint , right . . ?

You're wasting time if you haven't  got a filtered booth
and have filtered the air for 24 hours to get the lint 
out of it . . get your good flahlight out . . you can see
it in the beam if you look . . snowing in here !

Then you are wearing those street clothes . .

No way dude . . go get one of those paper lint-free coveralls

Oh yes  . . how'd you like to get one lousy hair out 
on the hood ?   :-)

None of the above is meant to discourage you . . paint that
won't stick does that . . :-)

So you do the best you can , , the lint is one of the reasons
you're going to rub that paint out anyway . .

The shroud got clean . . then I did some calking and bonding
inside . . roughed everything one more time . . car wash one 
more time . . first coat of paint as soon as dry . .

Rustoleum rattle can . . it ain't no piano . . :-)
