&lt;&lt; i am havng a problem with my '70 bay window, and was wondering if i could 
ask about gas in the oil.....i've been smelling gas recently and i changed 
the oil today...couldn't believe it....what would cause this?  even as i was 
draining the oil, i just watched what appeared to be gas, continue to drip 
out....any thoughts? &gt;&gt;

Hi John,
If it the dripping of fuel was continuing to drip out of the sump then it 
sounds like torn/cracked fuel pump diaphram.  If not the diaphram, check fuel 
pump rod hieght.  If the problem does not go away then replace carb shut off 
vavle and/or float which could be too heavy or compromised.   Eric&amp;Barb
