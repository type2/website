I will make my last post on this. I really like the idea of a double
door walk-thru van with an original sunroof. I don't really need the
side windows or the barndoor front (although I think that was a nice
touch). I think Mr. Ellis and I agree more than disagree. I was very
aware of the controversy that would arise from saying I liked the bus. I
much enjoy good heated debate. This was a good one. Plus I was very
excited to see someone put together one of the combo's I would love to
own. I too am being priced out of the bus for everyday driving game. At
least partially. I never thought I would let my Deluxe go but when I
started hearing the prices they were going for, all of a sudden I
couldn't afford to not sell it. My 60 Double Cab I am much more attached
to. It is staying. I have turned down some pretty silly offers on it. I
guess I am just a commercial guy at heart. It does worry me sticking two
daughers into that unpadded metal box so that limits some of the time I
can drive it. It will have shoulder belts all the way around (custom),
it will be sand green on top and palm green on the bottom (custom
again), it already has a 1776 with freeway flyer tranny (custom again).
I guess I am a custom guy at heart as well. I still drive air cooled as
much as I can. It is not my only transport anymore.  I do still
(carefully) load rocks, horse poop, mt. bikes, and windsurfing gear in
the bed so it gets used heavily. I would like to see how many people who
rip on the Ellis barnambulator, this purple double door creation, and
any other non stock beasty, are actually driving rigs with all numbers
matching, with original paint, glass, the right amount of orange peel in
the paint, the right hose clamps...you get the point. We all customize a
little bit, it just depends where you decide to draw the line. As long
as VW people are as friendly as they are, and we all keep the passion
(even if I disagree) I will stick around. It is a good crowd.
