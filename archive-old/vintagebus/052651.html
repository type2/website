David has caught me...  It should be the Y370, must have fat fingered that
one with my perty Lee press on nails again :) LOL

I could not get the US site to load so I went to Canada's site...  I cannot
verify either way that the Y370 is still available in the US.  Anyone...
Anyone...  Bueler... Bueler...

&gt; -Yokohama Y360  http://www.yokohamatire_dot_ca/main/index.htm

Do you mean the Y370LT?  Is it available again at long last? (looking at
that website it would appear to be, in the 195/75R14 size..hush george.:)
BUT thats a yokohama canada site.  Maybe the 370 wasnt killed in canada?
any canadians want to back this up? (and export a set to florida for me? :)

As for the Y356...blah. Drive at your own risk.
