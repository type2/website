&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; I was watching a video tape of Vintage VW ads and a couple talked about VW's 
&gt; new revolutionary &quot;Medi-Car&quot; diagnostic system and that a purchase of a new 
&gt; VW gave you 4 free &quot;Medi-Car&quot; diagnostic checkups.  It aslo stated that this 
&gt; system was able to &quot;find problems before they became problems&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else heard of this &quot;Medi-Car&quot;?  What was it?  Does anyone have 
&gt; pictures?

I think that it had something to do with the diagnostic connector that
appeared in mid-'71 on buses.  Supposedly, everything in the car would be
wired to sensors that led to the one big plug in the engine bay.
