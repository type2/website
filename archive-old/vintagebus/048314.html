&lt;&lt; Anyone volunteering to cut a NACA duct into the side of their bus?  It 
would
 have to be a barndoor in order to be a valid test subject.

There is a fellow in town who has done just that(not a barn door though) He 
is Known as Dr fix All. no kidding. he use to have a bus that had been hacked 
into a walk through complete with what looked like some sort of lawn chair 
for front seats, had the  NACA ducts , wheel wells cut, 72-79 tail lights, 
And MUCH MUCH more. Word is he roled that one over(some blame it on the lawn 
chairs) and hes cruising a new bus around, Looks to be an original 
paint(maybe just original colour) 62 0r 63. Wheel wells done, lines drawn in 
marker where the NACA ducts will be, I'm sure it will be much like the first.
