Subject: The best bus cam? 

Just wondering what cam you all like for a heavy Westi?

I am leaning towards the plain jane stocker, but would not mind a little 
hotter mild cam if it does not kill the torque needed for a heavy beast of 
burden :)

This is for a 2007cc Type1 running a 30PICT carb with DP heads heat boxes 
with a header and fat boy.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
