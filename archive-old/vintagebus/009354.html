&gt;I've got the tent for my 67 Riviera, and it does indeed have a rope sewn

&gt;There are 3 pieces of canvas:  The roof, and the two sides which wrap
around
&gt;and also become the front

&gt;That is a bit wierd since you have a Sundial.  It sounds like you have a
&gt;Riviera Camper tent.  Does the tent have a rope sewn in the edge that
slides
&gt;into that aluminuim channel over the cargo doors?  If so you might want to
&gt;buy the proper tent from PLF and then sell/ trade off what you have now.


I believe I DO have the original tent that came with my bus...from what
christen described the Riviera is similar...but NOT the same...my sides do
not wrap around...they meet with a third panel at the corners and all zip
together to completely enclose...I know it's not the usual Sundial tent you
see, but I do believe it is original and not a Riviera...I am not interested
in replacing the tent, just finding the original poles.

Thanks for all the input....but still looking for someone who knows where I
could find those poles!
