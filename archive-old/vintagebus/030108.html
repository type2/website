Subject: Re: [VB] '67 &amp; adjusting brakes
References: &lt;000b01c06ba2$1ecd0300$ba8898d1_at_churchill&gt;

&gt; I noticed that as the star turned (in the non-functioning, seemingly
&gt; upside-down passenger -side brakes) there was a significant hollow &quot;clack&quot;
&gt; noise as the star turned - all of the spindles were replaced (according to
&gt; p.o. repair invoices - which called them cylinders) during a complete brake
&gt; system overhaul in '95. All the other stars were greasy and made no
&gt; 'clacking' as I turned them... is it significant that the one that isn't
&gt; working is bone dry?

...Well, it might be significant, and it might not. At the bottom of the
adjusting stars are spring clips that keep them from un-adjusting. Many a time I
have seen these bent or broken off, so it may be that the one you hear clacking
is the only one that has the spring-clip.
