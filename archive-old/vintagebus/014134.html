Well,
I think if you put the bus up for sale, yoj are morally obligated to sell it
as well. It would be like putting your house up for sale, and then not wanting
to sell it because the people offering the asking price are a different race
blah blah blah...I remember calling about a bus that was for sale, the guy
didn't sound too interested in selling it. It really pissed me off. He didn't
tell me this until I had talked to him about it for about 20 minutes on the
phone, and set up a time to see it. I guess he at least told me before I
wasted my time going to look at it.

on the other hand i don't ever plan on putting my bus up for sale, as when
ever I drive around I have people tell me how they had a bus like mine at one
point and regret selling it ever since.
