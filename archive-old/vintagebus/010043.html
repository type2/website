Go to a decent marine supply and get some BRONZE wool.  Standard item used
in refinishing boats, especially wood boats.  Softer than steel so gentler
on your chrome.

Steel wool leaves behind itty bitty pieces that will rust and mess up the
finish, hence the bronze wool which can't rust as it's non-ferrous.
