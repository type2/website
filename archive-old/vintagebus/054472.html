Subject: Re: [VB] 65 wont take gas..solved!

There may be other solutions out there. But one that I have come 
across is http://www.por15_dot_com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.html.

-Rocky

&gt;at the advise of a freind, i got a new filter, that has white filter paper
&gt;instead of yellow. i ran the tank to almost dry and took apart the
&gt;filter...and sure enough, it was FILTHY. anyone know a good gastank cleaner?
&gt;is it easier to just get a new aluminium one?
