&lt;&lt; The door catch return spring is missing on our 65 Dorm and we can't get the
 passenger door open. Anybody out there who have experienced this have a fix?
 I know the obvious thing is replace the spring, however, we can't get the
 door open to work on it.

Is this a new problem, or did you just buy the dormobile?     When I got my 
65 westy it was near impossible to open the doors.  I used wd40, liquid 
wrench to open them.  I actually took the door panels off then, remove the 
mechanism, and cleaned and greased them, and reinstalled them, but often you 
can just spray it at the mechanism.  

Which spring in there is broken?
