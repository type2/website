Hello;
You may want to check out Willson Safety products (think that's their 
name). They make a disposable Tyvek / Clear plastic full face hood designed 
for people with beards. The only place I've found it is
htttp://www.labelmaster_dot_com
of course their site is written in visual basic with many problems. I would 
suggest calling them at 1-800-621-5808 and asking about product # Q2302 
(Continuos flow hood $59.40 for 1) They also sell a 10 pack of replacement 
hoods (these do not include the apparatus for holding the hood away from 
the face as the first item does) item # Q2303 ($135.85)
All this info is from their 1998 full line catalog.
I would be wary of home brew hoods as the chemicals in some of the 
paints/primers may not be compatible with the plastics used

Hope this helps
Ben

&gt; &gt;Before i have always used a standard canister respirator, but you cant use
&gt; &gt;one of those with a beard the instructions say, it wont seal right.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I now have a beard and dont really want to remove it, but i dont want to
&gt; &gt;destroy my lungs either...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;any of you other bus-nuts bearded and have a solution for this dilemma?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;You might want to rig up your own fresh air helmet with face shield, or
&gt;even purchase one (which may be a bit expensive).
&gt;
&gt;These things are great for all kinds of hazardous tasks such as sand
&gt;blasting, spray painting and paint/body putty sanding.
