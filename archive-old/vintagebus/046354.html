Subject: [VB] Re:  Benefits driving a Splittie
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

My benefits are a bit different and somewhat very important to me.
I was 15 when I first started driving my splittie.  It was a time in which I 
was heavily into drugs and alcohol.  I know i was 15 but it happens.  I was 
living on the streets and the bus was an incentive to go back home and make 
things better with my father.  Well in order to get a job to pay for the bus 
I had to of course get a job and the jobs available were drug free.  Along 
the way since then I have encountered many different things.  Tradgedy from 
drunk driving.  I lost around 15 friends.  I learned so much just from having 
a VW.  I learned not to hate people because they are older than me.  I now 
have many cool VW friends that are a *little* older than me.  Hey jerry!  And 
one things else that I got from driving VWs is giving.  I have never givn as 
much to people in need as I do now.  Wether it be a little time to listen to 
someones engine problems or donating to charities.

Its been fun!  And im loving every single second of it!
