From: Matthew Henricks &lt;mjhenks_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
Subject: List members in Oceanside (CA) area
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Do we have any list members in the Oceanside (CA) area
who would be willing to check out a Westy that is FS. 
I have been contacted by a guy out of the state who
needs a bus looked over.  I can not get down there
right now and am looking for someone who can.

This is a 67 Westy that has been advertised on VW
Planet that we is interested in buying.  It is suposed
to be real nice and original.  I am looking for
someone to give it a once over and report back to
either me or the person who is interested.

Can anyone help?

thanks
Matthew
