------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1CE72.706511B0

Hi all,

I'm forwarding this to this VintageBus List because I've seen it's &quot;subje=
ct title&quot; referred to in Steve Lashley and Thom's recent post's, but I ha=
ven't seen the &quot;body or text&quot; of the post in any digest I've received.  J=
ust is case, here are the true facts, right from the mouths of the MVVC O=
fficers who host this great Midwest event.  No speculation, just the fact=
s...read on and be truly informed, and make up your own mind.  I look for=
ward to seeing many of you Midwest VW enthusiasts there!

A very satisfied &quot;MVVC Festival&quot; attendee...

swagen Club


Recently there have been a rash of e-mail pertaining to the MVVC, it's re=
lationship to VWoA and the MVVC May show. I would appreciate if you would=
 take a moment to read the following. If you have any questions I can be =
reached at ed_at_mvvc_dot_net



What the MVVC is,

A group of 300+ members, primarily in Michigan. We started as a group  in=
terested in air cooled VW's. As a chapter of the VVWCA we went by the gui=
delines of any VW car 25 years or older being eligible to join. That focu=
s was fine tuned in 2001. After two surveys and a vote of the membership =
we have changed the by-laws of the club. While ownership of an air cooled=
 VW  is not a requirement to membership, they are the only cars in the cl=
ub. No water cooled VW's. Or to put it another way, the theme of this yea=
rs MVVC show is &quot;Air Is Cool&quot;. We are also a social club. The May show is=
 our main event, but we have many other events planned around the state o=
f Michigan. For more information on our events and our survey on the chan=
ge to air cooled please go to www.mvvc_dot_net
The May show is our money maker for the year. It funds the show for the n=
ext year. It also allows us to donate every year to a wide variety of loc=
al and national charity's and has enabled us to offer no interest tempora=
ry loans to other VW clubs (you know who you are!), struggling or just ge=
tting off the ground. Our May show draws primarily from the mid west, but=
 we have cars come each year from as far as Maine to California as well a=
s Canada. In 1995 the Gene Berg Memorial cruse was at our show. In 1999 t=
he DKF club joined us on their way to Bad Camberg. This year the DKF club=
 will be attending, and having their first ever national meeting at our s=
how.


What the MVVC is not,

In any way, shape or form affiliated with VWoA or VWAG. We are an indepen=
dent organization founded in 1986 for the enjoyment of air cooled Volkswa=
gens. As we are in Michigan, and the majority of members in the Metro Det=
roit area we have over the years had out May show at VWoA in Auburn Hills=
. Our Contract for the show is with the Landlord that owns the building V=
W rents. We receive no monetary support of any kind for having our show t=
here. And in the past it was a great place to have it. With the building =
open to view the VW museum it was a little something extra we could offer=
 to our show goers. And in the past we were happy to be there. VW was, to=
 a degree a friend to the hobbyist, and we were happy to have them show t=
heir new cars, again something our show goers appreciated.

 We are well aware of the headaches that the hobby is currently facing, t=
hanks to the _at_#&amp;%  mentality at VW. Remember the 300+ members, well we ha=
ve several that are small business owners (service&amp; parts for VW&quot;s) and h=
ave felt the wrath of the VWoA legal storm troopers, we do not have to re=
ad about the VW induced headaches, some of our friends and members are li=
ving it!. We have agonized as to the location of this years show. And lik=
e many others we are furious that VW is being so underhanded in their dea=
lings with air cooled VW fans and business people. We recognize and agree=
 with VW&quot;s right to protect its trademarks, but to go about it in such a =
heavy handed manner, and with out any concrete guidelines for the hobby a=
nd its related businesses is unbelievably stupid, amazingly shortsighted =
and asinine.

The MVVC show is at VWoA again this year. As this is our &quot;main event&quot; we =
cannot just walk away from this venue, this year any ways, and for severa=
l reasons. We have signed contracts with the near by host hotel (Marriott=
), landlord for the VWoA property, event permits with the city of Auburn =
Hills, insurance coverage for this specific day and location and others. =
Many of these were signed late last summer, and some have very stiff pena=
lties ($$$) for cancellation. Had we known then ,what we know now, the sh=
ow would be at another location!.  We want ALL of our show goers to have =
a good time, to feel comfortable in their surroundings, and to enjoy all =
the events we have scheduled for the weekend. If we were to change the ve=
nue now, it would financially ruin the club. No more events, yearly donat=
ions to charity, no more loans to other VW clubs. We have been working on=
 several other locations for the 2003 MVVC show. If VW continues to abuse=
 the very people that helped them along, in good times and bad, then the =
MVVC in 2003 will be somewhere else.


What you can do,

Come to the show, in your AIR COOLED VW&quot;S!!!. Yes, VOA people will be the=
re, let them see what the air cooled hobby is all about, the number of pe=
ople, the enthusiasm for the hobby. Talk to these people, let then know h=
ow VWoA and VWAG is hurting themselves, their sales and their position wi=
th the VW hobby. This show is for the air cooled enthusiast, don't let it=
s location keep you from enjoying one of the best shows in the Midwest, a=
s well as the country.

But if,

The location is too much to handle, you cannot bring yourself to set foot=
 at VOA, we understand. We are, at this point not too wild about it eithe=
r, but we are not going to let VW's current mentality destroy our show or=
 our club. We do however ask that you not direct your anger at us, we are=
 not the bad guys here. We are enthusiasts, just like you, and we are, qu=
ite frankly, just as PISSED OFF at VWoA as you are.

 We have seen recent e-mail's that suggest you should &quot;blow off the MVVC =
show and come to ours&quot;, that we are &quot;tools of VOA&quot;, and are being &quot;prosti=
tuted by VW&quot;, pimps, unwitting dupes. In other words, almost as moronic a=
s the current reasoning from VW!. I will say it again, WE ARE NOT THE BAD=
 GUYS!, DO NOT LET YOUR ANGER DESTROY THIS HOBBY!, or promote bad feeling=
s within the hobby. We are all in it together, lets keep it together.

Thanks for your time

Ed Karmann, MVVC Secretary
