Subject: Re: &quot;Partial&quot; 12V conversion. Has anyone done it this way?

&gt;
&gt;The &quot;main&quot; 6V battery would be drawn down by the starter and need lots
&gt;of current to recharge it, but would the regulator even sense this with
&gt;the other battery being fully charged?

The regulator would &quot;see&quot; the total voltage across the two batteries,
so it would &quot;notice&quot; one of the two being discharged.  However, it may
not charge up the string as fast as it would with a single 12 V battery,
for the reason you mention:

&gt;And would the non-starting battery even allow that much current through
&gt;to the other battery when it hasn't been discharged as much and doesn't
&gt;need the same amount of current?

It is possible to charge series strings of batteries that are at
different states of charge, but it requires charging techniques that
are a little more complex than what the generator and voltage regulator
can provide.

In my opinion: it would work, but not as well as a straight 12 V or 6 V
system.
