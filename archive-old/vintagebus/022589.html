I musta misted the previous posts: what's the pupose of putting silk in there?

&gt;    I brushed a light coat of permatex on the left case half, and then went
&gt;all the way 'round it using several strands of silk, since there are a few
&gt;gaps designed in there, and I could do that. The permatex was tacky enough
&gt;to hold the strands in one place with light finger pressure. After a little
&gt;while I brushed another light coat of permatex over the case half, and
&gt;installed the right case half over the left &amp; began putting the hardware
