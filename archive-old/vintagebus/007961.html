It looks like we're set today on going after each other. Why does it matter
what people do with their possessions? I mean once they buy the bus, it's up
to them if they want to turn it into an ice cream van or want to put it on
display in their living room. To some Busses are means of every day
transportation to others very cheryshable &quot;Vintage&quot;, &quot;Classic&quot;,
&quot;Collectable&quot; whatever.
Just remember that a few days ago we were bashing the guy selling his Bus on
eBarf and stipulating that he will not sell it to someone that will drive it
cross country or put big a** speakers in it. That was not right too.

What now? Does it mean that owning busses should be limited to a few chosen
VW fanatics-snobs?????????

Live and let live.

Later,

Andre



&gt; That's right! Use it like it should be used! I can't wait to get my
&gt; rusty 58 23 window done so I can drive it like it should be. It's not
&gt; gonna set in the garage and collect dust. It's gonna get seen!
