Subject: Parts Mavens

I'm trying to identify a few items on my '61 panelvan.  The previous owner
lowered the bus and I am going to reverse that process.  I'm hoping against
hope that I have at least a 64-67 axle beam so I can switch to ball joints.
I couldn't read the first 3 numbers because they are covered by the rubber
stop (which is number 111 401 273), the last 6 numbers on the beam are 635
682.  can the year be identified from that number??

Also I have what I believe is a bug IRS transmission.  I'd like to know if
that is the  case and also what year it is.  The numbers on that are 113 301
303 and below that AO 335 116.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Don.
