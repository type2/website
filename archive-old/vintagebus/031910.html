&lt;&lt; i bought a trans from a 67 and when the drain plug was removed a piece the 
 size of a chicklett bit in half comes out? it was a shiny and kinda pointed 
 definetly broken off on one side and looked to be worn on the others? the 
 van was running and driving, should i worry? i am planning a rebuild but i 
 wonder if i should do it before i install?

do you know what a fulcrum plate looks like?   If possible, find someone who 
has a loose one around and compare it.  When I got the 59 truck a couple 
years ago I was told it ran fine, until the motor died a month or so before.  
 Yes the motor was seized (and later turned out to have a broken cam, or was 
it crank?)   I replaced the boots while the motor was out, and changed the 
gear oil.  The old oil was so dirty, and had plenty of metal on the magnets, 
that I put motor oil in at first.  (thanks Dad for that idea)  It also had a 
couple large chunks that looked like pieces of fulcrum plate.  I was in doubt 
as to the veracity of the story I had that the tranny worked fine, but when I 
had the replacement motor in it was true!!!! smooth shifting, no grinding, no 
popping out of gear.   I drove about 15mins with the motor oil in, then 
drained it and put gear oil in the tranny (the oil was already filthy, 
cleaned off more shavings from magnets).  Changed the gear oil again about 1K 
later right after getting home from freeway driving when everything was warm 
and stirred up.

However, there was a certain large amount of axle slap.  This means when I 
accelerated suddenly, or shifted and stepped on the gas less than extremely 
smoothly, it would have a noise from the rear axle.    I had planned on 
removing the axles/RGBoxes, and replacing the FPs, but ended up selling truck 
first, of course I recommeneded this to the NO six or so months later, dunno 
if he ever did.    i drove the truck around town alot, and cleaned out my 
yard (trips to dump, get rid of old fridge, trip to scrap yard to get rid of 
scrap metal etc) so it did get miles on it and the tranny was fine - though 
the axle slap was noticable.  Also on braking hard.   This does increase wear 
on those moving parts.

From what I have seen of bus axles, they get so much more chewed than bug 
axles- the spade end that goes into the tranny (fulcrum plate/crown gear 
assembly area) gets worn.  Maybe one out of five will not produced any axle 
slap.   Eric (Veewee) was talking about getting axles chromed and machined, 
so that they could be assembled within spec, as nice un worn bus axles are 
hard to come by.  Sounds like a good idea to me.

So I don't know if I would do a rebuild now, but I would pull the axle 
tubes/RGboxes off (how are the bearings?) and check out the FP situation 
before assembly.   It depends on how much money you have to spend if you want 
to rebuild it now.  Did t=you drive the the bus before the tranny was pulled? 
  known history?  It may well be good.  then again, it may not, but that sort 
of chunk you found sounds like a piece of fulcrum plate to me, rather than 
anything to do with the center section.  

If what I am talking about doesn't make sense, read the section on axles in 
your Bentley reprint of the 63 ed transporter workshop manual, to see how the 
axle pieces fit together into the trans, and what fulcrum plates are.
