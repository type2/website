 Next, I want to add the cover plate to the oil pump that allows a
&gt;remote oil filter/cooler. I'll mount a filter next to the left wheel
&gt;well. In the oil filter line I can add a second cooler.

I go with Jason  S. on this.  Try the doghouse out first before adding the
second cooler.
You can always add the lines later.   For the filter use AN fittings and
Teflon lined SS braided lines.
I've had trouble finding 1/2&quot; ID line for AN8 fittings and have the smaller
ID lines on my vehicles.  Most of the hydraulic shops around here don't want
to mess with the larger lines.
The AN8 fittings are going to restrict the flow down to that level anyway
but there would be less restriction with larger lines.  Maybe you can check
with the local aircraft mechanics.
I mounted my filter as I had seen on the Vanbondo RFH at about a 45 degree
angle using one of the bumper bracket holes.  The filter is a little inboard
of the rear tire and I haven't had any problem with rocks etc.  Use either a
Fram HP-1 filter or the K&amp;N equivelent or something like a System 1 filter.
I've been using Berg pumps with 30mm gears thinking that maybe this would be
good since I'm running through all that extra plumbing, but it isn't really
necessary.  If using a big pump, it might be good to use a pressure relief
cover since the oil doesn't see any relief until it's gone through all the
add on plumbing.


 A hole would be cut in
&gt;the bottom of the box and in the tray below the box allowing air to exit
&gt;the box behind the left wheel.
Bob Hoover had an article on this.  It sounded like a good set up to me.
Alot of people mount coolers in front of the torsion bar.  That makes for
alot of tubing to me, but then the other way you have to cut a hole in the
bottom of the tray.  I was thinking having some rear-facing louvers maybe?
I am considering an oil cooler next year (have most the parts lying around
ready)  and have considered the options.  The only other option is to mount
it on the outside of the bus.  I did this twenty years ago and it worked
great, but buses are more valuable now.:)


 I'll be watching the oil temps with a new
&gt;gauge to see what each step does to the temps -

Make sure your gauge is reading what you think it is before you start.
Stranger things have happened.

&gt;sump,
I run sumps on my vehicles as well.  They won't do much for the temps,
except keep the oil from warming up quickly in the winter.  Ground clearance
is something to consider if you like to go camping in the boonies as well.
I haven't had any trouble, but it does reduce your clearance and if you
knock the sump off in the boonies be sure and have your hiking boots.  I
have to admit I get a little worried about that sump being on there
sometimes.

,doghouse

I think Jason's temps sounded pretty good on that.  Maybe it will drop temps
20 degrees.

,second cooler.
A second cooler can help alot I think.  I would think it would need a
by-pass set up so if you are running in the winter you won't be cooling the
oil too much.  There are automatic temperature controlled switches for this
but I was thinking maybe a manual valve with dual ports?  Another
possibility I've considered is just switching the lines over for summer and
winter configurations and capping off the cooler.  I've been thinking on the
cooler for some time now and it's more of a question for me than the rest.
Everything else bolts up nice and easy.  The cooler means either I punch
holes in the driver's battery tray or I run a bunch of extra tube under the
bus.  I worry about oil starvation on startup with all that tube.  Might not
be a big deal, but then again, if the oil is cold it might take awhile to
get going through all that?  I also don't want to cut up my bus, but it
should be possible to do the louvers without really making an ugly mess?
