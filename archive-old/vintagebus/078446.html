Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area?

I agree, seems to be a severe lack of documentation to back up either point 
of view.  

I have seen a *very* rusty 63 23 window body flex as it drove down the road.  
  In a bad way.  

re:  cutting the divider... some years ago i met this guy with a new bus in 
town and was checking it out.   &quot; Bummer how someone hacked the spare tire 
well.&quot;  I said.   He got all offended as he had just done it!!!  lol

if there is any actual info on something like this, or if it's just one of
those things that gets spread around enough that it just becomes &quot;common
knowledge&quot;.
