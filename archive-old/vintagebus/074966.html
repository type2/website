Subject: RE: [VB] SW gas heater question.....

Rick Taylor [busbarn_at_Prodigy_dot_net] has all the information, parts and can
even rebuild it for you. He put on a seminar a couple years back on SW
heaters and even has a video on it. He also has manuals for these.

Does anybody have a good information website on these?  I'm probably going
to be looking into putting a gas heater in my bus (supposidly, type 4
conversion means no heater), but don't really know much about them.  Thanks.
