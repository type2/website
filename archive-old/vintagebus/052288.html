Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

That's because you didn't ask enough for it!  If you'd asked $8k somoene
would have been along to offer you $6k!

Sheesh!  Do I have to think of *everything*?

&gt; We couldnt sell the bus we donated to the AZ Bus Club 2 years ago as a raffle 
&gt; bus for $500.  it was a 60 Kombi that needed floors, and a motor...paint 
&gt; would have helped too.
&gt; 
&gt; We couldnt sell it so we gave it away.
