&gt;  Same rules apply, when you get a full ring of bright on seat and

I'd be very careful about how you do this!  If you leave any lapping
compound in this most critical of passages, it will be delivered
directly to the bearings, which most definitely do not need to be
lapped.  Worse, the lapping compound will remain in circulation until
the next oil change.  Not a happy thought!

I think that lapping operations are better done on disassembled
motors, followed by a through cleaning.
