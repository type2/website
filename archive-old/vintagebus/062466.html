Subject: RE: [VB] chicago area vw shops

I only know of two or three guys in the country that does that level of
work. If it were my bus, I would gladly take it to him with bells on. I
was just making an observation.

Sorry,
Rich

Know of any other places within 800 miles that do work as good as Kelly
Brown's?

'67 Deluxe Bus

&gt; While I will agree completely with your recommendation, I feel it's 
&gt; prudent to point out the roughly 800 miles that separate them...
&gt;
&gt; There is someone on the list that specializes in VW restoration work 
&gt; and he's damn good. I know because, I've been to his shop. His name is

&gt; Kelly Brown and you can't see pictures of his work at www.metwiz_dot_com
