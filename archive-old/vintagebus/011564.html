&gt; John's recomendation on disabling the auto choke, anyone agree /
disagree?

Muir had some eccentric ideas, and quite a few people disagree with
him on the issues of automatic chokes and centrifugal distributors.

As long as the choke is adjusted correctly, it shouldn't cause any
problems.  The carb has a diaphragm designed to open the choke pretty
quickly after engine startup.
