&gt;How can I remove the steering wheel, without damaging it further.  It is
&gt;in good shape, just not lined up with the wheels.  My turn signal switch
&gt;is pointed to the 11 o'clock position, so it will cancel.
&gt;
The turn signal is mounted to the column and is turned by loosening the two
screws and turning it. If the steering wheel is off center, before you move
it you need to find out if you steering is centered. From center turn the
wheel to lock in each direction. If it is an unequal distance, your drag
link needs adjusted. This is the adjustable link from the steering gear back
to the center pivot. Basically, you find center by turning the wheel an
equal distance from each side, then adjust the link till the wheels are
centered. Not an exact science, takes trial and error. If you are not sure
of yourself, have it done by professionals.
