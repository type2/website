I have to agree.  I have seen two of the Dr. Joe tow bars - both were bent 
after normal use.  The angle iron used for the uprights isn't strong enough 
to resist the load put on it during turning without deforming.  Also, as 
mentioned above, it is too narrow and requires some sort of rigging to keep 
the bar from sliding back and forth across the beam and knocking off the 
grease zerks, etc. not to mention the safety issue of a bus wandering while 
towing.  I'm not sure why they were made so narrow.  Seems like an obviously 
wrong thing to do.  Any ideas?  For what it is worth you can pick up a tow 
dolly for about $500.  Yes, they do take up a bit more room but they are a 
hell of a lot more safe to use.  I'm lucky enough to have one I can borrow 
for free while I am still in Missouri...guess I will have to buy one when I 
get to Florida.  8-(
