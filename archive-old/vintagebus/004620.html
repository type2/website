Thought this would be useful for any of you folks who collect Split Window
Bus Ads. It's a list of what issue of Life Magazine had Bus Ads. I got the
list from another site (listed on my page) and have started adding pictures.
I only have two of the ads linked to pictures so far.  But more will come
soon, I have about 20 in my collection so far.
