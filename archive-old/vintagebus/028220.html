Subject: RE  TIARFOMB - ANCRONYM

Well  &quot;Busers&quot;  There has been some VWonderful answers to uncle jerry's ancronym
test.
There is at this time one person REAL close--If no-one can hit it Right-On--I
will mail them a bus prize--The answer according to   uncle jerry   will be
posted  June 1st!! So you have untill them to come up with a winner!!
Trust me, some of the answers are some of the funniest i have ever seen! as i'm
sure you have read on Both Bus lists--could the winner be on type 2 or
vintage?   Enjoy--that's what this VW Hobby is all about!!
