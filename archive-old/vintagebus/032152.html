&lt;&lt; Driving with a spare clutch cable and some simple tools and grease is a
 better skill to have. It takes one half hour or less (my time) to replace
 a clutch cable and adjust it, and be on your way. &gt;&gt;
Hi Cal,
Hmm,
Yes that is as always a good idea to carry spare parts, but what if it turns
out not to be the clutch cable that went out.  Say, the clutch disc explodes
so the pieces lock, or the bracket that the forward end of the clutch cable
attaches to wears out letting loose the cable end, or the new clutch bearing
throw out arm brakes with out warning.  These all have happened to us
personally and can not be fixed with just a spare clutch cable.  Even if you
have all the spare parts like we do let us say you are in busy city traffic
in a place that tows ($) away broken down autos cause there is no place in
the area to pull over and park, or even better in moving high speed traffic
and you do not have time to move your bus over several lanes due to heavy
traffic with just momentum.  Are you going to be happy sitting waiting for
the police to come along to push you, while wondering when one of the idiots
behind you is going to slam dance into you.  These are a few reasons why we
suggest that learning to shift without a clutch is a really, really good
idea!   Eric&amp;Barb
