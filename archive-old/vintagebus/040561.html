Are there plans for camping out at Irvine Lake?  Last year people were
handing out flyers telling about a campout at this lake.  I had a blast last
year and was planning on doing the same thing.  My wife is bugging the dodo
out of me to make sure there are plans BEFORE we leave.  She has no since of
adventure and is making me consider a New Acronym TIARFOLW (you figure it
out. Matt don't you dare tell her).  With that said, does anyone know of
campout plans?  TIA
