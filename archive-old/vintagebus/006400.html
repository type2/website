Let me start by saying that i do not strive to accumulate trophies.
But, there are two members of our club who win every bus trophy
in the region.They also happen to be my best friends.So the rest of us
in the club got a little tired of hearing about it ,so a few years ago I
thought
 I would try to do something about it.Now my 64 bus competed with them
 but did not have the detailing they had acheived( my bus is a daily driver,
there's are not)
So a few years ago I started bringing Italian beef sandwiches to the shows.
I then told anyone I gave one to, to vote for me and that would be payment
for the sandwich.
Well sure enough I started winning with regularity.I even won a best of show
! This really got the goat of my trophy whoring friends.:-)
It started getting out of hand and I could no longer afford to feed dozens
of people, so I started using a Hawaiian
theme for my bus.It started with tiki statues,slack guitar music,old
Hawaiian books etc.Now 2 years later it has avalanched into
vintage13 foot surf boards,tiki toes stickers all over the bus,vintage
hawaiian shirts,my daughters dressed in grass skirts etc.etc...
I have been shutout this year from winning a trophy, but do I ever get the
laughs from spectators.Not to worry I have some new
gimmicks up my sleeve for the rest of the year.Rusting doglegs or not. Watch
out BBTA goers !!There will be a little bit of Hawaii in
Missouri this year !
    All in good fun !! That is the point , is it not ??
Sorry ,Brian and Chris.But what is a plastic trophy good for anyway?


            Mahalo,
