Subject: re:worth the wait-Tom Conner Roof Racks

sounds nice...any pics?

I used plasti-dip on my clamps. I would probably not reccommed it, the st=
uff
eventually will creep over time, and become real thin where you need it m=
ost.
Next time I will probably just use some inner tube from a bike tire, cut =
to
fit, maybe epoxy on. As for the legs of the rack, i just use some clear
plastic tubing. Very cheap, easy to replace, and protects the roof. But I=
 am
not sure exactly how the legs of your rack are made.
