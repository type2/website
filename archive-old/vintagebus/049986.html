&gt;An experienced and reliable local tire outlet claims that at least half the

What I hate is when an alignment shop (really a tire store or car dealer
who also does alignments) finishes working on my car, charges me $50-$60,
and the car still pulls strongly to one side (the very reason I took it
in).  When I complain, I get the same old be &quot;the car is aligned perfectly,
so it must be a radial tire pull&quot;.  Then they suggest swapping the front
tires side to side.  I'm tired of hearing this BS cop-out excuse for not
figuring out the real reason for the pull.  I don't want to swap my tires
from side to side, and then wait for them to separate.  Aligning to spec
doesn't work for every car.  Cars can be bent slightly, suspension bushings
can be worn unevenly, etc.  It may be necessary to figure out what's really
going on with the suspension/frame/body relationship to figure out how to
modify the alignment settings to compensate and make the car track
straight.  These guys don't want to bother with that process, it might take
brainpower or extra effort.  Oh, no, not that.

I'm just sick and tired of these guys using 'radial tire pull' as an excuse
to take my money, while giving me zero satisfaction.
