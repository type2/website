Subject: Early bus gas mileage

Got a 1960 dealer bus sales comparison catolog and it has a bunch of
neat bus charts in it. All are from the northwest U.S. One Seattle
area fleet lists 17 VW panel buses from 1957 to Sept 1559. 2 of the
buses have over 81000 miles. The lowest miles is 14673. Total fleet
mileage listed is 21.2 MPG with 17 buses over 2 years. Clara, find
these 17 buses for us! Another one compares a Oregon TV company that
had 1 bus and 2 Chevy 1/2 ton pickups. From Oct 1, 1957 to Sept. 30,
1959 the VW got average 21.84 MPG and the Chevys got 8.41 and 8.38 MPG.
There is another one from Portland Or.  that switched his 57 light
bumpers for 59 Heavy duty bumpers. Just throw the ribs away and put on
override ones. He got 20.8 MPH over this time period. Anyway it looks
like 20/21 MPH was the norm for early 36hp buses. Great VW catolog, ask
to look at it if you see me at Jerome or elsewhere.
