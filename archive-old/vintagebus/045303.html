making the plug appear to be a bigger thread.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
This is why we hate to use helicoils in areas that must be unbolted even on 
occasion!  Best to see if you can have it solid inserted instead!  You could 
remove then engine yourself tear it down to a long block, and then either 
have it inserted by a local shop or do it yourself with a kit from 
&quot;Time-Sert&quot; or just replace the one head.  While you have it down to a long 
block you can then retighten all of the case, and head fasteners.  Plus clean 
out all of the fins of the heads, and cylinders.   Eric&amp;Barb
