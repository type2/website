  My '62 standard walkthrough is white over grey, the colors are original
I believe.
  BTW- I must shout HAPPY BIRTHDAY out to my &quot;old&quot; '62. He has been a bit
neglected due to the aquisition of the $1 &quot;new&quot; '62. But tommorrow is his
37 birthday. Festivities will include a paper hat, *NEW* &quot;vanillaroma&quot; air
freshener, and a hat full of &quot;I married a madman&quot; looks from my wife!
 All well wishes, cards, carpets, doorpanels and other gifts should be
sent to:
Otto the '62 Bus

Fresno, CA

[Clara the VW encyclopedia broke away from her parts books long enough to 
write]
in 62 the two tone schemes were turquoise/blue white and sealing wax
red/beige grey, while the one tones were I think SWR, dove blue, some sort
of white- i think pearl white,- no Ivory  and I think also ruby red (very
rare).

Hope this helps.
