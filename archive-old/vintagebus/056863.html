Subject: Re: [VB] Detergent oil, new engine?, When?

Hi Al,
We used detergent oil from the get go!  The detergent only helps keeps the 
engine case inside clean from carbon build up and sludge by keeping it 
suspended in the oil.  In the olden days (1930s or earlier?) automobile 
owners had to dissassemble thier engines about every 30,000 miles to decoke 
(Clean out all the carbon!) the engine.
