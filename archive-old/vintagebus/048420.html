Subject: Axle boot survey

Our club has been keeping a tally of makers and durability, and we have not
come up with a winner yet. We have tried VW boots and bilstein boots
(sometimes they have both marks) and a few others. I remeber my axle boots
used to 5 or 6 years, now it seems lucky to get that many months. One of
our members is keeping a running tally of the brands and how long they
last. I am actually thinking of trying the eurethane ones to see if they
last better. I hope they make them in black I don't think I could live with
yellow axle boots.
Does anyone have any insight to this dilemma?
