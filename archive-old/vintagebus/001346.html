Subject: Funky wiper control (IDEA)

I've had this idea for quite sometime and wondered if anyone has actually
tried it.  Is it possible on an old bus (or maybe even a bug for that
matter) to flip one of the control arms on the wiper frame so that when you
turn on the wipers, instead of them going back in forth in tandem, have them
come close together and then apart again?  I think it would add a neat psudo
vintage flair since our dubs are kind of odd anyway (compared to modern
vehicles).  Has anyone tried this?  Is there even room under a split window
dash to allow for the linkage to take a slightly different path?

More later - gotta get back to work and deliver some shingles...
