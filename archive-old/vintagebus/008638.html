I just bought a NOS in the box (box is worse for the wear), kilometer
speedometer.  What (in your opinion) is the thing worth? I'm asking because
I thought it was a NOS mph, but turned out to be km.  It goes up to 120 km,
and is mint. Is this one worth more here in the states than the mph speedo?

Thanks for any input
