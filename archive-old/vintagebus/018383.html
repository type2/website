Always PRE filter the gas as it goes in the tank.  You'll be glad you did.

Subject: [VB] RE: Mexican Gas




Greetings Fellow Bus Friends:

For Thanksgiving, we are driving our '67 21DLX (1600DP) down to San Felipe,
Baja, Mexico. This will be our first maiden voyage into Mexico with an Air
Cooled VW. My question is: I will need to use Mexican gas in my Bus. Is
octane booster advisable for use in my Bus? if yes, any recommended brands?
Or, is there another type of fuel additive that some would advise? Or, is
just straight Mex gas acceptable? Or, Is there any tune tips before the
Trek? Or,. . .

As always, Thanks for your time, I truly enjoy and appreciate this resource!
