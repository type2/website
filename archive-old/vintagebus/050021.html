&gt;vintageveedub wrote&gt;&gt;&quot;to all on the list i got scamed
&gt;by this guy (mr.kdf)  i got a listed as
&gt;nos
&gt;36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for
&gt;sure if it was
&gt;nos,
&gt;but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking
&gt;cosmilne on it.&quot;&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;To list, I am sorry that this unfortunate incident had
&gt;to be taken to a public forum such as this. This
&gt;person has refused to talk civilly, and refrain from
&gt;emailing me threats, and profanity among other things.
&gt;I have tried to listen to his side of the story and
&gt;make a fair judgement. It seems in truth, there is not
&gt;a problem with the case as much as the buyer was
&gt;apparently bidding outside of his means. What I am
&gt;saying is that he expressed concern over the amount he
&gt;had bid, even BEFORE he received the item. I listed
&gt;the item with as much info as I knew for sure about
&gt;it. I asked that all questions be posed before
&gt;bidding. Only two bidders did this, frankiehil being
&gt;one of them. When he received the item after I refused
&gt;to let him back out of the deal, he immediately said
&gt;it was trash. Folks there is no scam here, but rather
&gt;maybe a little overzealous bidding on an item in
&gt;hindsight. I am sorry that this had to be aired on the
&gt;list and I will not perpetuate the argument here.
&gt;Thank you for your time.

Just REFUND the guy's money, and all will be settled.  What's so hard about
that?
