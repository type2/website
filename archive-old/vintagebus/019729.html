Howdy Bus Nuts!

There's been quite a lot of comments made lately on this list about our
various perception's of the changes to the format of the upcoming Golden
Gate Chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America's (GGCVVWCA) Kelley
Park Meet held in San Jose, California on April 22nd.  Some of our more
outspoken listee's sound either disappointed with, or perhaps fear the
announced changes, believing it will affect the way they usually
participate in this great event.  I've even heard that some even plan to
travel to the area for the weekend to attend Saturdays Red Barn swap meet,
and then won't attend the KP event on Sunday because of their perceptions
of how the rule changes will affect them.  And after listening to some of
us state here how they &quot;believe&quot; it's going to be, I think that there has
been a lot of mis-conceptions about the KP changes, and that the negativity
is kind of feeding the mis-information about this years event.  

Without going into great detail, the event (as previously run) reached
&quot;critical mass&quot; last year, and changes had to be made to keep the event
functional at the Kelley Park site, within the rules and regulations of
both the City of San Jose and Kelley Park .  A lot of the VW's entering the
park weren't entering the show and parking in their appropriate class area,
and were using the lawns as spectator parking, reducing the available area
for use as car show area.  This caused many of the later arriving cars,
many that wanted to show, to be turned away as the site reached full
capacity in the opinion of the city/park officials.  There was some damage
to the lawns by some inconsiderate, immature vehicle owners that then had
to be re-imbursed by the GGCVVWCA (almost a annual thing).

Before we go on, let's be clear about where my personal priorities lie in
this discussion.  For those who don't know me, I'm a predominantly Vintage
VW and early Bus enthusiast.  I've been a member of NEATO since 1990, and a
past President of NEATO for seven or eight years.  I own both Vintage (3)
and modified (1) Busses and several other VW's, and I appreciate the merits
of both treatments.  I am NOT a member of the GGCVVWCA who hosts this
event, although I know several of their members very well, including the
long-time President of this VVWCA Chapter, Rick Spohn.  I am a member of
the national VVWCA.  Okay, now we kinda know where I stand.

I have made the Kelley Park event a part of my annual tour of &quot;must&quot; attend
VW events for the last ten or eleven years, and like a lot of you, I've
seen the event grow in size and complexity.  I don't envy the GGCVVWCA the
job of organizing and hosting and successfully pulling off an event of this
magnitude.  It's a whole lot of work and a big time commitment of effort
for the show committee members, and there are many volunteers involved in
getting it pulled together for the rest of us.  It's a very costly event to
host, the dealings with the city/park officials have been costly and
complex at times, yet the GGCVVWCA continually comes up with a great Spring
event to start off our VW event season.

For the last few years, I've been invited to stay with the Spohns when I
travel out (by plane from St Louis) for this event. They are delightful
folks to be with, and like the other event volunteers, they are hard
working, very organized and sacrifice a lot of their personal time to
hosting this event.  On arrival I'm delighted to assist them in any way
needed while I'm with them, and I'm delighted to usually be asked to drive
one of their Vintage VW's for them to the event.  

The other day while ordering parts from Ronnie (www.VolksHome_dot_com), we
discussed the upcoming event a bit.  He expressed some disappointment about
the rule changes, and I told him that I believed that there was a lot of
confusion/mis-communication about this years changes.  Since I know the
Spohns pretty well, I volunteered to call Rick Spohn and try to further
clarify the changes to the event.  I did so on Saturday, and in hopes of
clearing a few things up, here is what I found out.

Mis-conception:  &quot;Only &quot;show cars&quot; are allowed in the gate&quot;.

Fact:  A lot of folks are reading way too much into the words &quot;show car&quot;. 
The GGCVVWCA is NOT insisting that only gleaming, concours, stock
Volkswagens will be allowed into the park.  A lot of our Listees seem to
think this is the case, and it is definitely not!  The are eliminating the
use of the limited available ground inside the park for purely &quot;spectator
parking&quot; purposes.  Two city operated parking lots just outside the Park
entrance are available for spectator parking use.  They plan to more
efficiently use more of the property to park all the VW's that want to be
inside.  So, if you have either a stock, modified or custom VW, whether
beautifully finished or still in primer or oozing patina, you can still
enter the Kelley Park event!  And here is where the change takes place! 
This year to enter the gate with your vehicle, you will need to pay either
the &quot;car show&quot; fee or the &quot;swap meet&quot; fee.  (We'll discuss the swap meet
and all fee details in a moment).  Whether or not you want to really &quot;show&quot;
your 1976 or earlier Volkswagen, to enter Kelley Park this year you must
now park your vehicle in the appropriate designated class area for your
type and year of VW (all 1967 and earlier Busses parked together in either
the &quot;working class&quot; or &quot;luxury class&quot; in one area, all &quot;Oval&quot; Bugs together
in another, all Type III's together in another, etc.).  You will be
directed by event volunteers to that area and your parking spot.  If you
only intend to spectate, then you can lock up and walk away and enjoy the
event!  If you want to compete, then climb out and detail away to your
hearts content.


Mis-conception:  &quot;They'll be keeping modified/custom/unfinished VW's out.&quot; 


Fact:  You now know from the explanation above that this mis-conception is
wrong.  You CAN enter the Kelley Park event with any 1976 and earlier
Volkswagen in any style or condition.  In addition to the explanation
above, I've been told that this year the GGCVVWCA's Kelley Park awards will
be decided by participant balloting (each paid car entering the park with
the exception of swap vehicles will receive one ballot sheet).  Again, all
types and styles of stock and modified Volkswagens will still be welcome to
enter the Kelley Park gates and the event as long as they park in their
respective vehicle class area.


Mis-conception:  &quot;They're gonna charge me for my trailer&quot;.

Fact:  If you are towing a trailer with your VW that is obviously a part of
your display (i.e., a Eriba Puck or similar trailer, a cool Allstate or
similar vintage trailer, etc.) there will be no extra charge.  If you have
any kind of car trailer, swap parts trailer, etc., you won't be allowed to
bring it in as a &quot;car show&quot; entrant.  You can pull a car trailer or trailer
of parts into the event when you pay appropriately for a swap meet
space(s).  Those hauling a &quot;garage queen&quot; on a trailer to the event will
have to unload somewhere outside of Kelley Park, park their rig legally
outside, and then drive (or push?) the &quot;garage queen&quot; into the event.


Swap meet:  Any VW or any other vehicle may enter the grounds to sell VW
items in the swap meet area after paying the appropriate swap meet fee at
the gate.  I'm told that a single swap space will be $30 and a double will
be $50.  For extra large loads and spaces, they will make a determination
at the gate.  Questions? Contact the GGCVVWCA web site listed below for
more info and contact info.


Mis conception:  Spectator parking?

In the effort to provide parking for any non-VW vehicles, for any 1977 and
later VW's, and any vehicle whose occupants choose not to enter and park
their VW in an appropriate VW class inside the park, there will be two
nearby parking lots operated solely by the city.  I am told that the city
will charge a flat fee for all day parking of $4.


Cars brought inside the grounds of Kelley Park need to remain parked in
their class areas until 3pm.  I'm told that with 3000 spectators and over
600 VW's on the grounds, that the Fire Marshall and Police Dept. of the
city of San Jose insisted on this rule to try to avoid injury to any of the
spectators milling about.  The police and staff will crack down on
&quot;cruising&quot;.  Rick understands that anyone needing to leave the grounds
early for emergencies or for the long drive home (NOT coming and going,
cruising) could do so carefully.


Cost/fees:  Car show entry is $20 and includes one 1976 and earlier VW and
it's driver only.  Extra passengers pay the spectator rate of $5.  Children
between 6 and 16 years old pay $2, children 5 years old and under are free.
 A single swap space will cost $30 and a double will cost $50.   Contact
the GGCVVWCA for KP Event vendor info.  (there are already almost 30 paid
KP event vendors).

Over 100 Volkswagen enthusiasts/guests are already booked for the GGCVVWCA
banquet held Saturday evening.

If you still have more questions use the following web address for more
information:  www.GGCVVWCA_dot_org

I hope that the clarifications that Rick has provided will assist you in
preparing for this great event.  I'm looking forward to it myself, and I
hope to see many of you there in a couple of weeks.  If you still have
other questions or comments please go to the GGCVVWCA web site.

Thanks for your understanding, and I'll see you there!
