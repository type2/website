Subject: Re: [VB] Rear shift rod coupler replacement

I believe I got mine out by putting the shifter in first, loosened the 
bolts, shifted to second which disconneted the coupler, and it either came 
out then or I dropped the fromt mount and nose of the trans down to get the 
clearance, cant remember.  Either way, I didn't have to mess with the 
shifter.
