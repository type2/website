Subject: Re: [VB] 59 dc/sc gastank divider screws and strap pads

Before you start strapping down, do you have the rubber boot cushion that the
tank sits on?
As far as the divider fastners go, phillips sheetmetal screws.
I can mail you a pic of 4 the felts in case you never find any and decide to
make em. Theyre no big deal.

&gt;Most that have respond to the gas tank divider fastener quest say a phillips
&gt;screw.  I think later busses used a machine screw and a nut welded to the
&gt;backside.  The 59 double cab requires some form of sheet metal screw.  I
&gt;should look at the 67 tipper and verify the later model thing.
&gt;
&gt;So, I'm in need of any og screws that anybody may have.  I think I have some
&gt;gas tank felts coming already but as usual, I won't stop the quest until
&gt;they're in hand.  Too many times stuff comes and it's either not correct or
&gt;never does show in the first place :-(

&gt;that may be one of the cases where they changed teh fasteners used.  yes,
&gt;they did that.  On the wiper motor some where installed with the slotted
&gt;macheine screws, some with the 10mm hex bolts (same size threaded part, just
&gt;the top changed)
&gt;
&gt;Or is this like the splash pan unde rthe pedal of the bus, where some of the
&gt;fasteners are one kind (reg screws) and some another (machine screws)
&gt;
&gt;from my original post::&lt;&lt; ok, ar question #2476453.... I put my gas tank in
&gt;the dc last night and
&gt; started thinking about putting in the divider panels.  I counted 6 screws
&gt; needed for each panel and then went to look in the parts manual to see what
&gt; size/type fastener should be used.  The manual states a hex head screw but
&gt; in the work shop manual, it shows a guy removing the panels with a screw
&gt; driver and if you look real close, they appear to be a phillips head.
&gt;Also,
&gt; there appears to be a washer but it's unclear.  So I got to my sheet metal
&gt; screw bucket and I definitely do not find 12 matching screws. :-(
&gt;
&gt; Also, from the pics in the workshop manual, there appear to be some form of
&gt; pad that goes between the tank strap and tank... info please!
&gt;
&gt; So, can anyone tell me what is supposed to be there and then next, I guess
&gt; I'm looking for screws, possibly washers, and some original tank strap
&gt;pads.
&gt; Top dollars paid or trades.... you know the drill.
