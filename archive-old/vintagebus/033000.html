Hi NQ,
Not us!  We have been more than happy with our 1641SP with a 3.875 R&amp;P and 
.82 fourth freeway flier and running 215/75R15s on the rear!

We are not big into big HP engines, but wonder if the setup you have results 
in less torque in the lower RPMs below 4,000 RPM?  From what we understand 
the stock 1600 DP does somewhat the same compared to the 1600 SP.  While 
having a high RPM, high HP engine is nice, torque is what gets you up the 
long hills.   Eric&amp;Barb
