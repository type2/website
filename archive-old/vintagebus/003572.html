Got my first issue. Very similar layout design and content to Volksworld. I
thought it focused way too much on late model buses,  although it did have a
54 SC and a nice 61 Westy, both full features. Best part was the 51 &quot;tempo
matador&quot; coachbuilt VW which used some type2 parts (Its a single cab
wanna-be).  A small snapshot of Jerry Jess's &quot;bessie&quot;? hippy bus made it in
there as well. I think the magazine itself was kind of a disappointment
(unless you like late models), and the last 10 pages of the magazine were
printed upside down? dunno what the deal is with that....
just my 2¢
