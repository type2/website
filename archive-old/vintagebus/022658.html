&gt;Are the popouts in a '54 barndoor kombi any different than the '55 &amp; up 
&gt;popouts?

One difference that I've noticed, and it may be a wolfsburg/hannover thing,
is that there are &quot;cutouts&quot; for the screws *and* for the stationary brads
on the outside of the frame.  Other than that, I haven't found any
significant difference.  Both my '55 and '54 had these type of popouts.
