&gt; Hmmm, my '71 would be just about topped out at 70 and I've a feeling that

&gt; going 62 (and it's more accurate than the one I replaced!  :)

George,
This sounds about right for 3.88.  Mine does 80 at 3800 I believe with
215/15 rears.  Speedo agrees with the &quot;your speed is&quot; signs around
construction sites in NM and AZ.  I have 195 14s in front that should
agree pretty close to stock.  I'll have to assume the tach is right
though.  I think 75 is 3500 on mine.  The 71s had a pretty short R&amp;P
didn't they?
John
