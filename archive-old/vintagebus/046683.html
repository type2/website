&lt;&lt; This sounds exactly like the turnsignal problem I had with my Panel. Only
 thing wrong was that the taillight bucket was not properly grounding. I
 properly grounded the bucket and the indicator light in the speedo light-up
 and the left side taillight/blinker started to work. Check to see if all
 your connections are clean and you have a good ground wire directly from the
 bucket to the chassis. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
This is why VW finally riveted a male slide connector to the forward side of
the 1968 and later buses and ran a grounding wire from there.  We do the same
to any bus we get and run the ground wires directly to the battery ground
strap where it bolts to the body.  This makes a huge differance compared to
the little sharp point of the bulb holder that is to make this grounding
happen.  Even if your signals work without ground wires you might have a
flickering of light level in the tail light that is not blinking due to back
feeding of the electricity through the running light wiring.  Electricity like
water find ways of getting where it wants to go.   Eric &amp; Barb
