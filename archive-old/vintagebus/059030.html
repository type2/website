Subject: RE: [VB] 412 gas heater in a bus?

You could place it above the transmission and pipe the exits right to the
body heat tubes.  Talk to Shad Laws as he has one placed there in his
fastback.  If you need any parts for it let me know as I have about 6
complete units with fuel pump, relays, wiring , etc.

Subject: [VB] 412 gas heater in a bus?

I am getting a 412 gas heater for free and was wondering if anyone has
adapted it to work in a bus?

The design of it is different than a typical BN4 kind if thing but I am sure
I can mount it somewhere effectively.

I am thinking about making a custom westi rear facing seat (non-walk thru)
and adapting it in there.  Maybe mount it under the bus and tap into the
stock heater channel.

I am not going to use the stock heat exchanger system, so I need some sort
of heat...  Planning for winter already :)
