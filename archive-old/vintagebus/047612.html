Pmailed us:

&lt;&lt; there are 2 wires in a semaphore, one to activate it and then the wire to 
the bulb......if you isolate the bulb wire you can run it to the blinker 
switch, thats how they do it in Germany to be legal........ &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Definitely, but one would still have to have a seperate semaphore switch to 
keep the semaphores from pounding up and down with the signals.  Unless one 
is willing to be rid of the USA flasher type signals to get down to only one 
signal switch.  Eric&amp;Barb
