Subject: Josh Rodgers

This is in regards to Josh Rogers.  Brad Beyer another friend of Josh's
from OK emailed me about the sad news just a few minutes ago.

I havn't known Josh but for about the past 3 years, but his love of the
hobby was contagious.  He was always excited about busses and buggies.  If
you need to get &quot;pumed up&quot;, all it took was a call or an email to Josh.

It is difficult to think about not talking with him anymore.  Those who
knew him have lost a good friend.

I will be going to the funeral, it is on Friday, December 18 at 2pm.  When
I get more details, I will send them out if any of you would also like to
attend, or send a tribute.
