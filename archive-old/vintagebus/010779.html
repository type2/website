How are you with woodworking?
How &quot;hippie-fied&quot; is your bus?  How about macramé'?
There's always good old black electrical tape.

&lt;&lt;i've got a steering wheel that's missing about 95% of the bakelite
material. Seriously, it's basically just the metal frame!

Seems like one of those times to try something custom. Any suggestions?
Anybody done anything wierd with an old steering wheel?
