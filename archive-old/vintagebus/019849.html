  After having temp and oil pressure guages in my '62, I 
feel paranoid without them when driving my '60. I would 
like to get some Moon guages (which are actually 
manufactured by autometer I believe) for my oil temp, 
pressure, and cylinder head temp. Do you think VDO 
senders will work with these guages?

  On a sad note, Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth passed away on 
April 4. His cars and Rat Fink creations made him an 
icon in the Hot Rod and Kustom community. To find out
