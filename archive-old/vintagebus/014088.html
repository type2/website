Here it is, thanks H. Steve. Sorry for the bandwidth
use
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/68bus/

I am clearing the yard out in expectations that H.
Steve's 67 Westfalia will be joining the arsenal. 
This bus is clearly a parts bus but has the following
items:
Z bed
All Cabinets
Jump seat
Table
Jalousie Windows
Deluxe trim
Steering column/box + extra steering box
Transmission
COMPLETE DUAL PORT 1600, cranks by hand, Shop guy said
it ran. I'd bet it does
All glass except rear window, have a spare w/defroster
lines if need be.
I know I offered the carcus of this bus to a list
member in Philly for free but I haven't had time to
part out and have lost your email address. If you
contact me I will cut a deal. I would like to get $300
for this bus or best offer.  Trades for split window
stuff is possible. Here are the bad things
No Title
No turn signals or back up lights
No instrument cluster
Sliding door is shot
No engine lid or apron.
I will wait a couple days before I post off list, H.
Steve will have some digital pictures available for me
in a couple of days.  Cherio,

Patrick Flynn
75 Campmobile Deluxe
67 SO42 Benchseat
