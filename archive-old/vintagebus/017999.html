few more I final cut the rubber and installed it.

Ellis pops out into the open long enough to suggest
leaving the rubber window vent seals, the front door
upper half rubber strip and most all other door
&quot;gasketry&quot; a bit long until the weather in your area
cools off. Cutting the rubber to it's &quot;proper&quot; length
when it's screaming hot out like August in Arizona or
stretching it longer so it fits into the seal
groove(s) will leave you short and sad when it cools
off. Trust me, no one wants to be short and sad when
it's cold outside ;-) hahaha
I leave the upper door frame seal at least 1/2&quot; beyond
the track, on each end, to facilitate the run off of
moisture. Take a second to really look at how that
seal will lay into the door opening, especially on the
leading edge.
Silicon spray, stretching and big old wood clamps
works great. A traditional press is the real ticket if
you can find one. Try your glass shop at last resort.
Beating the hell out of the wingframe with a rubber
mallet is a PITA method.
