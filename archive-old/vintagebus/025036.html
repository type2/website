Sounds to me like the reproduction deck lid available from Wolfsburg
West and a few other companies.  I have seen these in person...strange
beasts..they have the `58 deck lid style but with the later push button
set up.

Also, a friend of mine also has a `85 Brazilian Double cab which sports
a very similar deck lid...maybe these are the late Brazilian bus style
deck lids?  I heard they will fit earlier buses despite the strange
appearance.
