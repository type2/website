Actually...that costa mesa pickup also had a rear tailgate!
My friend alex bought it....Its now restored and far far away (japan)
he still has the tailgate....pretty beat up though, even had angled aluminum 
poprivited over the top edge.
My singlecab sat in Ojai (Near Ventura) for a NUMBER of years.
It had been in Ojai all its life.
It was dove blue and pretty damn solid.
I think a few people might have seen it at keppy park with hoops and canvas.

&lt;&lt;Could that  be the one I looked at two years ago down in Costa Mesa?  This 
SC
was fairly rusty and it did have a smooth rear gate.  The guy wanted 2K for 
the
truck (he advertised it as a '60) and when I told him that he had a very rare
rear gate...he looked at me like it didn't matter.  Truck was more project 
than
I wanted.  Any here buy it?
