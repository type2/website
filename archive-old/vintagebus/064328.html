Subject: Re: Lowered Bus Question

&gt; How do you guys with slammed buses change your rear tires?
&gt; I was trying to remove the rear wheels from my doublecab last
&gt; night, and it was a royal b!tch.  With the bus completely
&gt; off the ground, shocks disconnected, I still couldn't get
&gt; the wheel off without bending the quarter panel a *lot*.  I
&gt; had to bow the hell out of it to get the wheel out of there.
&gt; As Johnny Cochran once said - &quot;it does not make sense!&quot;  Now
&gt; I know why I see so many bent quarters on lowered buses - the first
&gt; flat tire out in BFE instills metal-mangling-mania to get the
&gt; wheels off and on and back on the road.  No thanks.

The usual way I see people do it in the UK is to use a bottle jack to push the
spring plates down.  Wouldn't want to do it when it's raining though!
