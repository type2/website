and can I have it for 50 bucks?   

but actually a garaged rust free original 67 pop top westy would be a
showpiece.    How much do you want to spend, there was a really nice low miles
westy at the Octobugfest show (64 hard top I think) for a reasonable sum of
circa $15,000.

I bought a 65 westy (bench seat hard top, which I wanted)  not running for
cheap, but it was worth it and more, as a good starter, mostly complete,
decent body rust wise for around here.   I recommend going to VW shows,
hooking up with a local club, and finding out what is available and going
rates in your area.   And realise that virtually any splitty will require
catch up maintenance, as well as the 3,000 mile tune ups, and you should be
prepared to either find someone qualified and experienced with vintage vws and
pay them to do it for you, or learn to take care of some it yourself.    If
you can find someone trustworthy  who knows old VWs who will look at it for
you to let you know of any impending repairs it needs that would be helpful.
I know someone who bought a nice looking westy, and had the motor die within 2
months- the oil in it looked muddy grey flecked with metal shavings- a bad
sign.  Be patient, you can find the bus you want if you wait, and keep an eye
out.   I know a guy who found a splitty dormobile for $200, and it ran, even
if the seats were a bit tatty, though I am sure it needed a little TLC.

It's not just a car, it's a cult
