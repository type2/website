&gt; If you can figure out how to get them into the US legally, let me know.

The disclaimers also state that they don't guarantee legality in the
country of delivery.  I know that UK residents can import Brazilian buses,
but they have to switch to RHD.

As far as importing to the US, forget it if you want it legal.  I _think_
that you can import it as an ORV (as they do for SCORE class 11 bugs) or
show vehicle, but there is probably a heavy bond required.
