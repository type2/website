&gt;&gt;This weekend I had Sarah, this girl I've been going out with for a couple
of months, drive the extra bus to the RAMVA get-together and to the 'rama.

&gt;&gt;She also commented on the amount of attention she got while driving the
'55 home from the 'rama.

I followed Thom and Sarah across town after the RAMA.  Three busses in a
row, a '60 panel, a '55 westy, and a '62 westy. It was HOT in Sacramento.  I
had the windows open and could hear the comments of other drivers at stop
lights.  The comments had two theme's: 1. Bug-O-Rama is in town.  2. Did you
see the chick driving the bus?

It was a parade.
