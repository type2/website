Subject: Grateful Dead Bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Due to popular demand (two people on the list asked), I put up a picture of 
the artwork on the Grateful Dead bus that I got at an auction a little while 
ago.

It takes a minute to load, be patient.

If anybody went to a Dead concert in this bus, I'd appreciate a story!

Greetings from the great Southwest,

JP
