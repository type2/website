i know this subject is a little old, but i'm kind of behind on VB things (i
have that other life to live). I came up with a good idea for a camping
shower setup in a bus that any of you are welcome to steal/borrow/make use
of. first you open your back hatch. see how it stays open above you? now
imagine a curtain rod going around the whole hatch with a curtain attached.
now imagine a shower spiggot (sp) clamped to the little panel below your
window with a hose running to it from a water tank located above the engine.
see where i'm going with this? pretty neat huh? for a base, you could get
one of those plasic water heater stands from home depot and drill drain
holes in the bottom (so you don't have to stand in mud, defeating the
purpose of taking a shower). and voila! now you have fully imagined a neat
little shower with a sun window. how you pump the water is really up to you.
you could use a hand pump or one of those electrical pumps that are found on
later model westy sinks. also, if you have a monza-style exhaust, you can
use it to hold your soap! (bumpers work too).
