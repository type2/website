Subject: Re: [VB] RATS!

Plenty of sympathy from here. Sounds familier. I suspect 
my 23 year old of scheming to get my '65 21 Window by 
removing the cars in the way. Machiavellian if you ask 
me, and it's still under resto! He's a step behind your 
son... shedding rice-burners to get my '71 Bug.  You 
should worry if he's able to sabotage a Buick and kill a 
Bug! Don't let him near your food and drink unattended! 

   -Harry in Fresno 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Muh 20 year old just called me.  He has been using my '74 Burnt Orange &quot;Phoenix 
&gt; Red&quot; Bug that I restored back in 1990, because his '97 Buick Skylark won't pass 
&gt; emissions.  He just blew a rod through the side of my 1600 dual port.
&gt; 
&gt; RATS!  I do have the old 1600 dp out of my bus when I put in the 1835 Bergmann.  
&gt; But still, the thought of it!  Now we have to fix up the old 1600, I am sure it 
&gt; needs new rear main seals.  It leaked oil like a sieve.  It could have been the 
&gt; dog house cooler though.
&gt; 
&gt; sympathy, anyone?
