Removed the cargo floor on the 21-window this weekend. Thinking of licensing the RFH moniker from RVB! A couple really nasty problems reared their heads and I started thinking about chopping the top and grafting it onto another bus. Mice urine is the biggest culprit in the really bad problems:

1. At the top of the front door frame, the lip for the seal is rusting away on both sides. Also, there are rust holes in the front window pillars.

2. A crease in one of the pillars (by the right passenger's foot) looks like it will be very tough to straighten/repair. I do have a spare nose, however, and I kept this section.

3. About a quarter inch of bondo smathered across nose.

4. Damage in the rear of the roof, by the rear cargo door, both from a dent, and from mouse piss.._dot_causing rust. Very difficult place to get into.

These don't represent 20% of the problems, just with the body; then there's the drive train to think about. I realized at one point that normal people walk away from buses this bad off. Then I shrugged off the thought and got back to work.

It occurred to me that in this particular case, it probably would be easier to graft this roof onto another bus. I checked out the m-codes today and there's nothing particularly exceptional about this bus to keep me from considering the conversion/parting. I knew of a good candidate for this, but I think it's sold. I'm going to check out another good candidate this week, but I have no money, so I don't know why I'm bothering. I *swear* I'm not an addict! I can stop anytime I want to!

Either way, I set my sites on Christmas, 1999 to have this bus on the road. That's a personal challenge and will require some effort to accomplish.

Thanks! Joe
