I bought a complete 36 from a small swap in phoenix for 45 dollars. Guy
&quot;gave it away&quot; cause he was &quot;tired of the oil dripping...&quot;? I also know of a
guy who sells good cases for 100. has a pile of em. prolly be more worth it
to part out that engine instead of selling it complete.

&gt;The 36 horse guy from Aloha, Oregon  ( I can dig up his name and address
&gt;if needed) was at the McMinneville, Oregon show with rebuilt 36hp
&gt;engines, $500 turnkey, and $250 long-block.
&gt;Seems like less and less folks are interested in these.
&gt;I sold a good rebuildable core last month for $20.
