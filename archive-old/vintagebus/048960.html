Hey to All:

Sold the '65 Double Cab.  Summer is coming and I've got to get in a camper.  I'm so tired of projects, with 2 sitting in my driveway, that I've decided I need to find a nice camper and just have fun this Summer.  The projects can wait until Fall.

I've gone back and forth on bench seat vs. walkthrough.  I think walkthrough is the way to go hands down.  I'd love to find a '60 or '61 Westy, but in a walkthrough that ain't gonna happen anytime soon I don't think.  I'd rather have a Westy over an American camper kit, but from what I've found the American kits are actually more &quot;practical&quot; in terms of usage.  Maybe ain't as vintage as a German kit, but seem to work good if you're going to &quot;camp&quot; and not just go to shows and show it off.  I want to camp.

So, who has my camper sitting in their garage waiting to find a new home?  Original paint or original color is mandatory, *zero* rust (ha ha) is close to mandatory and definitely preferred.  I've had the rust buckets.  I'd rather pay more up front for something solid than get a cheap project and pour hours of time and money into it instead of using it.  Westy, Sundial, COA, Riviera....bring 'em on.  I'm motivated today cuz I have a few bucks in my pocket.
