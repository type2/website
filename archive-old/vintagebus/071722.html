mailed out a list I have included a few more cars I thought  I might keep.
This will be a big auction with great opportunities to get those hard to
find parts or cars. Many cars are parts cars some are driveable some are
very nice. I hope to see you there. My mom will be providing food, great hot
beefs locally made hot dogs etc. Our local vw club will be driving some of
their vws it should be a fun day. Bring a trailer and a camera. No
registration fee, Cash or certified check accepted.  All buys must be paid
for at the end of the auction. You will have 7 to remove any vehicles
purchased.  Please pass on to friends who would be interested. Thank
you-Mark Oman
