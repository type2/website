Subject: Repairing Moulding?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

After inspecting the rocker mouldings and portions of the beltline moulding, 
I notice quite a few small pits.  I have heard through the grapevine of a way 
to fix this and bring it back to like new condition but I can't figure out if 
it was true or if they were just blowing exaust out their heads.  So does 
anyone know any tricks or tips?  Come on you deluxe guys and share your 
secrets! =)

Thanks to Thom for the info on being able to chrome the housings for the 
t-lights, I am taking the set along with everything else, ie. door handles, 
latches, spoons, ashtrays and interior trim down to the platers this week.  
Just have to make sure they don't screw up them up!!  That would just be 
wonderful.  At least they came well referred.  

Well time to get back to stripping the bus apart.  I have found quite a few 
little goodies in there for example...I found a dash plaque from a car show 
put on by the Four Cylinder Club of America, &quot;The Ghost of Funky Henry&quot; from 
October 1968.  Have to put that back in there when shes done!  Anyone know 
anything about that show??  Anyone want a pic?

See all you nuts from AZ in Prescott!!
