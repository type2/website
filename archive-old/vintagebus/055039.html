And if I ever get a Moto Bike its Gonna be a BMW. From the 60's of course!

I am currently in the process of fixing my Kadron carb. Again I am looking 
at fuel pump pressure and the relaibility of the regulator (fuel inside the 
carb). Its amazing to me that a stock carb can put out too much pressure, 
but that seems to be the problem with alot of after market carbs.
