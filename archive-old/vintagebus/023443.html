Howdy Volks,

I'm trying to get my side wall lights working in the '67 Westy.  From what I
can see, the rear celing light wire goes up along the driver side raid and
to the switch on the left side of the speedo cluster.  I see only one wire
that goes up front on the left groove.

Do the two side Westy camp lights go to the back (engine compartment) of the
bus or some other place?  Or do the go up front to the fuse box and I'm just
not finding the wire?

Thanks.
