Gary:

    You could start by telling the list [it's kind of like group
therapy] what kind of shape the splittie is in ... that is to say, maybe
you should be parting it out as one piece ... you would be surprised
what some of us consider restorable [ no need to believe me ... just ask
VanBondo ... the man knows rust ...even when he doesn't see it ;)].

Not that I'm making an offer yet ... but with a nice French-Canadian
name like Girouard, where would this '67 be located ;)
