In a vintage VW auto body repair manual (owned by the infamous VW &quot;HOT
PANTS&quot; Howard) it has the prices of all the parts and the labor to install,
I did not see front floor sections or halves. Will check further and will
try to make copies of this for all to enjoy.

I've seen NOS barndoor floor outers, so it may have been a production item.
Given that's it's a common area for rust, and for damage in front corner
collisions, it makes sense.

passenger sides only, or was this an aftermarket invention??
