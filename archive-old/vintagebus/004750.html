Chris Burke took my brothers 67
&gt;SO42 to Havasu this morning.  Didn't make it.
&gt;
&gt;He currently is at a pay phone in Parker.  The bus is sitting at mile
marker
&gt;16 on Hwy 72 about 3 miles east of the 95.

&gt;According to him there was a loud noise that had occured. Possibly a rod.
&gt;Anyone on the list know of a way to contact anyone at the BBB show?  Cell
&gt;phone or whatnot?

&gt;Dan Howard
