Subject: engine lid locked!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, list_at_hvwc_dot_net

Is there an easy way to unlock a t-handle without the key? It seems that the 
guy I got it from has never had a key for the locks (only ignition) and some 
how the handle locked when I closed it last. So now I am unable to get to my 
engine compartment and I need to get this thing going, I am sick of looking 
at it (Ok, I'm sick of pretending to drive it) 
Is it possible to unbolt the apron from underneath?
Anybody in Houston know a locksmith?(that wouldn't charge an arm and a leg?)
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Brian
