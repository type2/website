To paraphrase your .sig, &quot;If Dr. Porsche was still alive he'd walk in
there with a pistol and shoot those people who have kludged up his
cooling system!&quot;

Take cooling air from _under_ the bus?  Perhaps, if you only drive on
smooth paved roads, but what bus will _never_ find a bit of dirt or
gravel now and then?  There's an excellent reason why the vents are up on
the side of the vehicle!

I've had my engine bay get filthy from the dust that made its way past
fresh engine seals.  I'd hate to imagine what it would be like if I gave
it free entry via the front engine tin!  With that cooling fan, the
engine bay is like a vacuum cleaner, and your engine also has to
_breathe_ that air (you, too, if the heater is on!)
