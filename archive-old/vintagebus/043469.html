&gt;How much pressure did you have to put on the muffler to get it into place?

I didn't have my spring scale handy, but before I did anything, the
muffler was off by about 3 or 4 mm.  Once the jack contacted the
muffler and the frame, it only took about two strokes of the jack to
get it to where it was lined up.

&gt;I'd be a bit worried that the continuous force on the head might cause
&gt;a problem if it is 100+ pounds  the barrel studs aren't under that much
&gt;torque, especially with small studs.

I actually did think about this, and decided to live with the results.
I realize that loading the studs in shear is not the best thing.  When
I got the left side to go, I didn't have the right side cranked down
tight...just a nut engaged a few threads to keep the muffler from popping
off.  That way, the outward force should be more-or-less evenly 
distributed across both sides.  The flange nuts cinched down OK...the
flanges didn't seem to hang up on the studs as they seated down, which
I might expect if there was really a lot of sideways force.

One of the responses I got suggested maybe the heads were flycut a lot.
I'm not sure that heads would be flycut this much, but I do know that
my heads are not identical, per the part numbers and marks cast into
them (I noticed this when adjusting the valves).  They're both 1500 SP
heads, but not both exactly the same.  So the problem might be in the
heads, too.

&gt;I had a similar problem with a manifold (mexican, never again!) getting
&gt;the heat riser to align.  I ended up heating and bending the left
&gt;connection to make it align properly.

When I got the Bus it had headers on it...those four snaky tubes that
go into a big triangle flange.  I don't know if that was a performance
choice, or maybe the PO ran into the same problem I did...headers would 
be easier to squeeze in slightly than a muffler would.

&gt;Personally, if it was an alignment problem involving the cylinder 
&gt;studs, I would have seriously considered rejecting the part.  There's
&gt;just no reason for this part to fit badly, since it is easily constructed
&gt;on a jig.

Because of my location (not Southern California), rejecting a part
usually involves shipping hassles.  I can get cheap mufflers locally,
but to get a German one means ordering it in.  &quot;Making it fit&quot; with
the $12 bottle jack gives me a muffler so I can run the Bus now,
instead of waiting another couple of weeks for another muffler which
may have the same fitment problems.  Besides, I wanted another bottle
jack anyway.   :)
