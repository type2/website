Having read some posts recently about how well VW trannies and motor cases
burn is always intriguing.  Sets off a picture in my mind of the high
heat, white light fun stuff around the campfire on cool nights with a host
of friends and some Rumplemintz too most likely.
But have you seen where a 250,000 pound pile of titanium shavings caught
fire outside a mill in Oregon last night?  Now that must've been quite the
fire!  And not much could be done....anyone know what would happen if you
tried to douse a titanium fire with water hoses????
oooooooh boy!
It's Friday and I can bring up this kind of rhetoric right?
later
