Subject: 205/75/15 tires

The Tire rack has some really good sounding Dunlop light truck tires.
According to one of Kabayos old posts the 205/75/15 is one of the most
accurate sizes. Anyway I do not want to start a huge good tire bad tire
thing...All I want to know is has anyone put a set of 205/75/15's on a
stock height early bus. I am using the factory 15&quot; wheels which are way
skinny and I have a 60 Double Cab so the fender lips come down a little
more. I would like to hear from anyone who has actually ran this tire
size on the stock wheels. I don't want to have to let air out to change
tires and stuff like that. I am just looking for a good tire that will
handle a load and last. These tires have a load capacity of 1598 each
and sound really good. I just don't want to be stucl with a tire I can't
use.
thanks in advance,
Craig
