&gt;and this stuff seems to be made specially for putting on the inside of cars
&gt;or at least in their applications.

My guess is that these guys are simply buying the stuff from Home Depot in
bulk and reselling it as sound deadening material for a profit.  That site
has been posted to the list in the past, although there is a lot more info
on the site than there used to be.  I have ordered the free samples and
will report back to the list when I get them and try them out.
