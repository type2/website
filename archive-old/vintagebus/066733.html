Subject: 40hp heads

Is the 373 really so much better than the 371F?
I'm rebuilding a 1963 40hp. The heads I have are the 371F kind. One looks great,
the other is missing some cooling fins, and I can't convince myself to use it.
Should I be asking the swappers on the list to go through their parts
collections for one decent 371F or for a pair of decent 373 heads to sell me?
Thanks.
