Subject: Re: [VB] German Parts

Some are still out there, but they's gettin' scarce to come by.  Drums will
be the most difficult to find NOS.  I haven't seen NOS Brake Shoes in over
20 years, but I have used what's been available on the aftermarket
(rebuilt/relined) on a 59, 60,  61 &amp; 67 I used to own awhile back -
generally quality is decent as certain FMSI standards have to be met on
relined shoes to legally sell 'em.

Check with Bus Depot first to see if Ron has some stuff kickin' around at
usually the best price.

http://busdepot_dot_com or 215-234-8989

Or, get on the phone to:

Vintage Parts (Shawn) 818-500-8778

BFY Parts Obsolete 714-639-4411

Wolfsburg West (Rich) 951-549-0525

Locally there in Phoenix, AZ, contact Competition Engineering (Dan)
602-454-1555

The above places are bound to have some German-made stuff.  Watch out for
hydraulic items that have been sitting around for more than say, 5 years.
If the &quot;shelf&quot; life is more than that, expect to buy at least the rubber
rebuild kits to renew them (I learned the hard way with 67 only Master
Cylinders that I had laying around for 15+ years in dry storage).

Don't expect to find everything at one shop.  Be prepared to buy a little
from each source above for the whole ball o' wax.

With that said (this is an experienced personal opinion), I have used the
Brazilian variety of Master &amp; Wheel Cylinders on my old ex-Type 2s in the
past, VARGA being pretty darn good of the lot.

&gt; Hello All
&gt; Are new German parts still being produced? Are they still
&gt; available?  Where
&gt; I get them?
&gt; I am looking into rebuilding my brake system for my 61 bus.  1 Master
&gt; Cylinder, 6 wheel cylinders, 2 sets of brake shoes.  4 Drums. Did I miss
&gt; anything?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
