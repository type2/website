The Bentley Manual might be a good place to look.

&gt;From my 63-67 transporter reprint:

&quot;Following are the tire specifications:

Transporter models with 
			3/4 ton payload have 6.40--15 tires, and those with
			1 ton payload have 7.00--14 tubeless tires.

Note: From Dec 1963, Chassis No. 1 222 026, all transporters are fittied
with 7.00--14 tubelesse[not my typo] tires.
The designation of the wheel for these tires is 5JKx14 and part no. 211
601 027 F

[inflation charft omited, you oughta check it out]

6.40--15 Tires

Carcase strength: 4 PR (Pr= ply rating)

Dimensions:
		Outside diameter	690mm+- 6 (27.16+- .24&quot;)
		Width		   max  163mm (6.42&quot;)
		Effective static radius 321mm+- 3 (12.64 +- .12&quot;)
   	       Effective dynamic radius	328mm +- 3 (12.91 +- .12&quot;)

[more pressures skipped]
[tube replacement procedure skipped]

Tires 7.00--14

Only variations from the 6.40--15 tires are described in this section.

The 7.00--14 tires are of the tubeless type and are marked &quot;Scglauchlos&quot;
or &quot;Tubeless&quot; on the sidwalls.

Note:

to comply with a unification of standards for Europe, in future ALL tires
must be given a PR designation.  Previously a designation was only
necessary from a carcass strength of 6 PR.

PR means Ply Rating and is the international designation for the carcass
strength.

In addition, new maximum permissible loads for idividual tire sizes have
been decided upon so that tires with stronger carcasses must now be used
on Transporter Models.

For type2 vehicles, therefor, tires bearing the following description are
required:
	all Models		7.00--14 6 PR tubeless
	all Models with M 171	7.00--14 8 PR tubeless

As only tires comforming to the new standards will be manufactured in the
future, the aformentioned designations also apply to older vehicles with
the immediate effect.

All tires manufactured to the previous standards and bearing no PR
designation must only be used as 4 PR tires.

Dimensions:
	Other diameter		666mm +- 6 (26.22 +- .24 in.)
	Operating width:    max 189 mm (7.4 in)
	Effective static radius 307mm +- 3 (11.88 +- .12 in.)
       Effective dynamic radius	313 mm +- 3 ( 12.32 +- .12 in)

[pressures deleted]&quot;


now, from the 68-74 bentley.

&quot;the 68-0 models are equipped with 5JKx14 rims....the 5JKx13 wheels have
an offset of 47.5mm (1.7/8in)...

...the wheels on all models coverd by this manual are suitable for use
with tube or tubeless tires of the correct size, including radials. Tires
of nonstandard size may be used only if the tires manufacturer specifies
them for your particular make and model VW.

13.2  Tire types and Pressures

Conventional (bias ply) tires are factory installed on all models through
1970.  All 1971 and later models are factory-equipped with radial ply
tires.

CAUTION---  Not all bias ply or radial tires are the same.  when you buy
replacement tires, select only tbias ply tires designated &quot;reinforced&quot; or
-- for Delivery Vans and Station Wagons -- with the suffice &quot;C&quot;.  other
tires of identical size may have inadequate load-carrying capability.

[descriptions of conventional/radial/winder tires omited]

and that is what is what.

if anyone has the .shop. book for the bays, we could get more data,
perhaps.


Have fun.
