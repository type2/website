&gt; Can't you _make_ a 220v circuit using 2 110v circuits? Isn't a 220v circuit
&gt; just 2 110v hot leads, one going to the hot side and the other 110v going to
&gt; the neutral?

If you have both sides of the like going to your house you can do this,
but some houses only have one side and the neutral.  Some poking around
in the fuse box with a voltmeter might be instructive.
