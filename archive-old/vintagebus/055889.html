Subject: Jalousie window rebuild question

Has anyone gone so far as to replace the steel hinge rivets in 
camper jalousie windows? Mine are rusted and binding badly.
I thought I would replace them, but realized that the rivets would
have to be loose to be able for the aluminum pieces to move.
I thought about pop rivets, screws, and various other schemes but
don't know how any of these would work.  Any ideas or experiences??
Thanks, All....

DUCK
