&gt; So I got my front shift rod coupling welded and it look perfects.  So upon
&gt; reassembly would it be a good idea to use anit-seize in there?

I do.  I haven't noticed any more loosening of fasteners that have been
anti-siezed than those that haven't.  The only fasteners that I wouldn't
put anti-sieze on are the wheel nuts, but I've never had one of them
freeze on me.

I also drill and safety-wire the special bolts on the couplings, since
they would be quite hard to find out in the boonies.
