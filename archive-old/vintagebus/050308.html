Subject: Busses at San Diego Swap Meet

Two busses at the &quot;Big Three&quot; swap meet today:

66 (I think) non-walkthru 21 window.  Decent shape.  Looks like it is
mostly all there.  Says it has a freeway flyer trans and a 1600 engine.
Body looked pretty straight.  Asking $12.5, or offers over $10.5.

67 21 window walkthru SLIDING DOOR bus.  Crappy paint job, and cut dash.
No rear seats.  Looked like a sloppy paint job on a collection of spare
parts.  Body looked pretty straight, though.  $6K.

I have the phone number of the first bus.  I can probably get the number
for the second one.  Pmail.

Dave
