To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It just occurred to me that since I will be in Michigan this weekend that I 
will have an opportunity to attend the Michigan Show at VWOA Headquarters. 
Whoo-hoo!

Any listees going to the show? Would like to know specifics like early bird 
time, resale lot items of interest, specific show location. 

Please feel free to respond to me off the list. Hope to meet some of you.
