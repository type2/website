Total VW (formerly FL4T) is an excellent magazine. They always attempt to
cover the whole of  AIRCOOLED VW scene and always feature  a camper or two.
The editor, Paul Cave, is a genuine enthusiast and one of the contributors
is a Splitty owner who has used his '66 as a daily driver.(Step forwards Mr.
Ben Hayes!) I may be biased as my brown 'n' red '55 Devon camper was
featured when it was still 'FL4T', but it seems to me it's a magazine that
attempts to cover 'real cars and their owners'. If anyone wants details of
the subscription address, I'll happily e-mail it to them.
If you're still struggling to get an issue, Richard, I can either scan the
pic's in for you or post you a copy.

&gt; Is there anyone over in England that gets Total VW and could send me a
couple copies of this months issue?  I'll gladly cover costs plus some beer
money.  My friend in London told me my bus appeared in Total VW this month
but she can't seem to find a copy for me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Richard

&gt; FLAT 4 is now called Total VW. This magazine is getting better and
better...
&gt;
&gt; But VolksWorld RULES!!!
