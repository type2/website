Subject: 6V wiper switches
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 1998 18:08:50 PDT

Hmm...
My '66 bus has a two speed switch and a 6 volt wiper motor that
runs at two different speeds (currently extra fast and super fast, since 
I didn't put in the voltage drop yet.)  As far as I know it's
mounted in the usual old style way with a screw on the bottom.  Anybody 
know if this is normal?  Chances are good that it might not be a stock 
setup.
               Diana

&gt;That's true.  My error and I'm sorry..  Is there another 2
  speed switch that mounts the same even if it doesn't come from the
  motherland?
