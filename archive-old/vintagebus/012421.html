I think I have a clue to what this person is illuding to.  When I
played musical tires a couple of weekends back between the 66 and 67,
I destroyed 3 19mm bolts in removing 4 tires (Craftman/replaced).  I
finally was able to remove either with an impact wrench or a extra
superhuge breaker bar my neighbor had.  When using that  breaker bar
my arm strength actually moved the front tires (spin freely by arm
force, not jacked up at all). I must be a muscle head? I had my
neighbor put his foot on the wheel while I jumped up and down on the
breaker bar, that worked.  Can't believe I watched the PO put the
wheels on with an air compressor, can't really complain it was a
pretty good deal.  Hope this helps.  The 67 is tagged and titled and
has cruised Annapolis a couple of times, love driving the split!  The
66 is still available if you all know anyone who is interested.  The
camper interior went to a listy, otherwise is a decent fairly complete
van.  If I absolutely have too I will part out and keep the motor and
tranny, don't want to do that but I need to support my VW habit.

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I took the wheeles off in the front and the bolts are on so
tight, how or
&gt; what do you use to brace the drums so they dont move while you screw
the bolts
&gt; off. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; Are you saying that you took the front wheels and drums off as a
unit and now
&gt; can not remove the lugbolts?  If so then best thing to do is to
remount the
&gt; drum/wheel assemblies back on your bus.  Lower the bus back onto the
ground,
&gt; block the rear wheels and engage the E-brake.  Then use a least a
1/2&quot; drive
&gt; rachet wrench or breaker bar and matching 17mm socket.  You might
also have to
&gt; use a breaker bar to improve your torque.  Eric &amp; Barb

&gt; I was unclear on what he was trying to undo from what- but this
interpretation
&gt; makes sense.  It is helpful in saying things like the front or back
wheel.   I
&gt; always loosen lug nuts with the rim on the car, resting on the
ground, then
&gt; jack it up to unscrew them.  Lug nuts (or bolts really) take a 19mm
socket,
&gt; though, which is the same as a 3/4 &quot;.   I use a 3/4&quot; impact socket
1/2&quot; drive
&gt; on a long flex handle.   The long pipe (tall as me) is always close
to hand if
&gt; needed.  Never broke a lug bolt yet :)
