Subject: Alert: Possible FRAUD

 
Volks,

Many of you know that we run a classified ad page as part of the
www.type2_dot_com web site. The classified site is called &quot;Aircooled Buy &amp;
Sell&quot; and I think it's probably the busiest VW classified site on the
net. That doesn't really matter, except that we know a LOT of money
changes hands over ads posted to BuySell.

We received email this past week alleging that an individual was using
BuySell to liquidate busses and parts in an unscrupulous way. Normally
we don't try to police transactions on BuySell, but the amounts of money
mentioned in the email were pretty astronomical and we felt we had to
look into it. Since the individual was alleged to be using several email
addresses and we couldn't tell which ads in BuySell might be bogus, we
pulled the BuySell site down for the time being.

Having asked around, we turned up enough corroboration that we think
there is an obligation to tell the VW community that we are no longer
accepting advertisements from this individual, and to ask for your help
in letting us know if he tries to post ads under different addresses.

The gentleman's name is Frank Leach, doing busines out of Provo, Utah,
sometimes using the name Christy Motors. We think these three email
addresses are associated with Leach:

	rubberbus_at_aol_dot_com
	vwbusnut_at_aol_dot_com
	bootsandsaddles_at_aol_dot_com

I've been told there are additional &quot;throwaway&quot; addresses, hotmail or
yahoo, like that; but nobody has actually given me any of those
addresses at this point in time.

There is at least one web page devoted to exposing Mr. Leach, it is run
by Jack Stenner:

	http://www.pursebuilding_dot_com/bus/completion.html

I am also told there is an investigation being handled by the State if
Utah. If you are an unhappy customer of Mr. Leach you might want this
contact information:

	Dennis Ige
	Utah Dept of Motor Vehicle Enforcement/Investigations
	(801)371-1070

I actually hope that Frank Leach will pop up in these public forums and
explain why all this concern is unfounded so I can retract everything
said in this message--it would be better to be wrong about this, I hate
to see vendors go bad although regrettably I have seen it again and again.

Special thanks to Yvan R., who carries the BuySell site, and Paul who
keeps BuySell cleaned of duplicates and spam. For every predator there
are a hundred good guys and it's important to remember that.
