Subject: 40 HP lives!!!

Hey All,
Well I got the 40 HP that I &quot;half&quot;  built in the 64 started and running today!  It actually sounds pretty strong.  There just seems to be a lot of valve noise.  Can anyone tell me the right valve clearances for the 40 HP?  The manuals all say that the setting should be .006&quot; for all type 1 engines, but I think I heard somewhere that you should set them at .008&quot; for the 40 HP.  Anyone know if this is true?  Would the setting beiong off .002&quot; cause excessive valve chatter or is it more likely that the noise is just because the engine has been sitting for about a year?
