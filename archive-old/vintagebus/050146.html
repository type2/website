&gt;Speaking of turns to lock, I recently popped off the pittman arm(correct
&gt;name???) so I could straighten the wheel (wasnít too successful as there
&gt;is too much play in the center pivot).  Upon centering up the wheel I
&gt;reinstalled the arm.  To my dismay, I must have turned the wheel too many
&gt;times as my turn to the left is WAY to short!  I think the QEII could make
&gt;a left hand U turn in less space.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in its
&gt;throw??  How many turns from lock does the output shaft have to go to get
&gt;centered??

I believe that the pitman arm in NOT supposed to be removed and reindexed.
Seems to me that the splines are sometimes made (on some cars) with one
different from the rest, so that there is only ONE way to put the pitman
arm on.

I believe that the CORRECT way to center your wheel is to loosen all of the
tie rod end clamps and rotate the tie rods with a pipe wrench or similar
tool.  Each tie rod has a right-handed thread on one end, and a left-handed
thread on the other end, like a turnbuckle.  This means that turning the
tie rod will cause the length between the tie rod ends to grow shorter or
longer as the tie rod is twisted.  By shortening one tie rod while
lengthening the other tie rod, the centering of the steering wheel can be
affected.  Don't forget to reset your toe-in before tightening up your tie
rod end clamps.
