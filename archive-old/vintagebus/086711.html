Hi Donna &amp; Lili,
Could be lots of connections or switches in the wiring causing the  problem.
  Get a copy of the wiring diagram for your year and VW.   Vintagebus_dot_com has 
these in COLOR that you can print out.  Then get a  multimeter, and set it on 
a low DC setting that your voltage fits into.   Check for voltage at battery 
posts.  Then check each connection for  any drop in voltage while going 
forward to the starter, fuse box, headlight  switch, ignition switch, and back to 
both the coil and starter solenoid.   You should have less than half a volt drop 
by the time you get back to the coil  and solenoid.
  Good to take apart, clean, apply dielectric grease, and  tighten each 
connection to avoid future connection corrosion  problems.  Also do this to the 
place the battery ground strap connects to  the body and to both ends of the 
grounding cable that goes between the front of  the tranny and the body.
  If you have not done so yet, check out the headlight repair  procedure in 
the type2_dot_com library, and soldering together the brass pieces in  each socket 
of the fuse box.  Doing this greatly helps to get rid of  voltage problems in 
these areas.
