&lt;&lt; &gt;last night a buddy and i were shooting the sh*t and admiring our type 2s
 when i remarked that the front bumpers on our volkswagens are different.
 they're both pressed bumpers but the one on his panel has a wider area in
 the center between the two raised areas while the bumper on my truck has a
 smaller area between the two raised areas.  his panel is a '54 and my truck
 is a '56.

 The earlier/Barndoor style (pre-March 8, 1956) has a smaller license plate
 portion which equates to a longer ribbed piece:

hey Everett, where did you get the March 8 56 bumper change date from?
