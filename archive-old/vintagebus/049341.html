I am taking my 67 21DLX and camping for a week on the playa, a (mostly)
dried, prehistoric lake bed. I will be traveling off road about five to
fifteen miles on the playa to camp site (could be thirty miles round trip
off road). A good number of vehicles will be attending, causing a lot of
this dust to be airborne. Also, dust storms occur from time to time.

A few tips...
1. Don't park it where the burning man will fall
2. Put a &quot;sock&quot; over the air intake, get 'em at an off-road shop. No need to change oil. 
3. Try not to drive in dusty air.
C. Let the 4 dimensional, grey-with-red-pulsing-stripes-3-headed giraffes lick the playa magic dust off your van on the way out.
