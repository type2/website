im am building my 59' kombi to be a traveler.now i did not want to lower the 
bus becouse i as well like the ground clearance. so i just recently purchased 
a 1967 big nut tranny with a 4:12 r&amp;p now with 25&quot;tires il be crusing at 
65mph now there is several different set-ups where you could be crusing a 80 
mph with stcok reduction boxes. i personally want to live here on earth a 
while longer so 65mph is alot better than 80 mph in a bus.i bought my tranny 
from I.T.S in el cajon but i here ronnie at old volks 
has many freeway fliers in stock .


p.s dont lower it .:)
