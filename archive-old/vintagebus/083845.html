Subject: Re: Front Seat adjustment...

Thanks for the input. Thats a bummer though. I really like those old buses 
but if I cant even drive in traffic with on/off clutch pedal leg straining, 
seems like a no-go. Was there no-one over 6 foot pre-60's???????
  It seems like the seat is not so much of the problem as is the seat back. 
Does anyone have any ideas or things they've done to modify it to work with 
longer legs/taller people? My 67 drives fine! ---- JD



&gt; Would anyone know if the cab section or seat set up is any larger or
&gt; smaller than that of a later years split bus? Is it an issue of bench seat
&gt; versus walk-thru?

I believe the bench seats in at least 60 &amp; earlier are closer to the
steering wheel than later.  I know that is the case between my 63 DC &amp; a 60
DC in any event. (seems to be about 2&quot; closer?)

Clara, help?
