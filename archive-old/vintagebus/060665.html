&gt; any experience with these? 

Hi Kevin,
We have used them and they are the best ones being made today that we have 
seen so far.  With a stock muffler you have to either cut and reroute the 
muffler left side heat riser tube or cut and reweld at a downward angle the 
neck of the cover of the oil filter/pump so as to clear the heat riser tube.  
We have done the latter with good results and this also allows use of a 
larger filter.  Which ever way you go make sure the filters you use have an 
internal pressure relief valve or when cold weather hits, BOOM!  BTDT.
