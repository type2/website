 i'm doing my first two splitties, 66 and 67 standard.
 i don't have a good knowledge of the vintage yet.
 i am in western new york, not much chance of local
 used parts, and i need lots ...
 i think clara  mentioned splittie glass pop-outs could be
 had for $ 10-15 each , i need  a dozen ! my glass is
 mostly sigla, the few parts on these busses without rust,
 but the frames are rusted out. i don't know if the glass
 will mount alone, or if frames can be found to fit them..
 also looking for a set of roof glass, i have the clip to fit...
 making a 19-window bus !  i would like to connect with
 a used parts source... anybody ?

you do need to have the frames to mount the windows and though Sigla glass 
can be hard to find, sekurit is not that bad to find, though rust free frames 
do tend to be hard to find, and possibly not cheap.   sorry dont have a 
source of nice ones.  

If you are really thinking of grafting a 21 roof on you bus, read the 
archives, there is much on subfloors and why sunroof buses need them. Putting 
a huge hole in the roof of you bus reduces structural strength, thus 
reinforcement under neath.

you may consider the idea of converting to less pop outs.
