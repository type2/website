Hi all,

I just checked RAMVA to see if anything exciting was going on in that
neck of the WWW.  Surprisingly I found that the new editor of VW trends
joined and asked how his first magazine was.  I don't know if any of the
rest of you are interested, but I made my voice heard that the vintage
VW community would love to see a less soggy magazine and that it would
be fun to see a monthly feature on &quot;Whats in your garage&quot;, and really
get down to the heart and soul of people Rustoring their cars.  I know a
lot of us here for example like to hear about people and there finds and
rescues.  Maybe it won't change things, but maybe it will.  With the
third mag no longer in publication maybe a little change will occur with
on of the other two.

Just a thought.
Later,
Aaron
