I happened to watch most of the auction on TV over the weekend.  I thought
it amusing how the announcers kept reassurring viewers that the buyers
were buying very intelligently, not throwing money around, knew what they
were buying etc.  In the next breath a 40K Mustang sells for 80K, and a
Vector (car which never was mechanically sound and for which you couldn't
even repair-no parts, assuming you drive it...) goes for 400K!  The show
displayed awesome cars, but clearly catered to rich cats who wanted a
fancy showpiece.  I never saw a VW up on the block, and I was wondering if
any were in attendance.  
Given what I saw, I can understand the hype around a Sundial!
