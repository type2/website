&gt;&gt;Twice now I have blown the gasket out of my oil filter in the bitter

&gt;
&gt;Make sure the make of oil filter you are using have a relief valve.  We 
&gt;used to use Fram filters and had two blow up due to no relief valve
&gt;during cold weather at only about the freezing temps (32F).  The WIX
&gt;filter with thier relief valves have been no problem in temps as low
&gt;as -6F.

Both filters probably have relief/bypass valves, but the one in the
Wix filter is actually working right.  The Fram bypass valve is plastic,
while the Wix one is metal with a rubber seal.  Also, for one size of
filter, the Fram filter has 193 square inches of filter area, while
the Wix has 349 square inches.  These tidbits are courtesy of the
following interesting pages, all by the same guy...

retailer to quit telling people that a particular manufacturer's
filters suck.

Two special features, one on a popular (water cooled) VW/Audi filter,
and another on some popular Mopar (Chrysler) filters.
