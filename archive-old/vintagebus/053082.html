Subject: Re: [VB] m-codes mystery

&gt; one thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the same 
code meant different 
&gt; things in different years. 
  
Ok, so codes mean different things in different years - 
did they also mean different things in different models?
 &quot;199 - Driver's seat as swivel seat Types 211. 213, 214 
 and Camping Car&quot; would lead me to think so, since my 
model 265 is not specifically listed maybe M199 means 
something different for the 265 that we don't know about.
Thom what is your source?

&gt; Do you have the special 59-60 truck rear bumper?

 Unfortunately no, I have slash bus bumpers. No splash 
pans on the back, Westy bumper on the front (both very 
straight and powder coated white if anyone has a truck 
bumper to trade).

&gt; I thought 361 was a US spec code.   I have never found it on any list, just 
&gt; on lots of US spec buses of about your year.

&gt; 
&gt; Interesting that 175 is used for us bumpers for non trucks, and 176 for 
&gt; trucks.  later US spec code packages include the bumper,  your code package 
&gt; doe not include us bumper, so you get extra us bumper code.
