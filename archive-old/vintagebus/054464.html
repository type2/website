Subject: Re: [VB] front end question-related to my steering problem

Hmmm?  Rod from steering box to engine?  Might be the shift shaft or
perhaps the clutch or throttle cable tubes?  Could you describe it more
completely?

&gt; i was looking under my '67 bus today to see if i could see what was causing
&gt; my steering problem when i saw something abnormal. there is a rod that runs
&gt; over top of the tie rod ends from the steering box-all the way to the
&gt; engine-what is this tube called? i am slowly getting more familiar with bus
&gt; anatomy but could use some help. any way that tube is loose and resting on
&gt; the bolts of the swing arm/tie rods- and not letting me steer normally-
&gt; is this a major problem? would it alone cause my steering to be very loose
&gt; and creaks and pops when i steer? any professional diagnosis out there?
&gt; thanks for you help.
