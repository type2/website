&lt;&lt; It appears to me that using tar to apply plastic bags full of insulation
would work, but due to settling and the awkward unstiff nature of an
insulation-stuffed bag, it would make dow foam board more practical if not

Hi NQ,
Right on all counts.
 
&lt;&gt;
Sounds good to us.  Had not throughly looked into all of the availible
products yet.

&lt;&gt;
Right!

&lt;&lt; This all brings to mind several questions - who is actually going to
volunteer to slather tar on the inside panels of their VW?  Is tar the best
solution to this? &gt;&gt;
Well it is the best we have found so far.  It is the only material we have
found that actually repels rust.  VW itself used it for glue to stick down the
sound deadening panels on the type 1 floor pans in the 1960s-1970s and also
used it to glue tar board sound deadener into the front doors of the type 1 in
the 1970s.  Both areas in rusty VWs are rust free under and just around these
tarred areas 20-40 years later.  Due to this we paint the inside of floor pans
in out type 1s and at least the lower 1/3 of the inside of all doors of our
VWs to keep the rust away.

&lt;&lt; How do companies like Dynamat get by with using their product without
causing rust?  What do manufactuer's on today's auto manufacturing front lines
use to accomplish what we're trying to do?  Could we accomplish the same thing
by applying styrofoam to the interior panels rather than to the sheet metal?
&gt;&gt;
Have a bad feeling that they do not worry about this due to the fact that most
folks do not own cars for more than five years.
