Subject: 63-71 Euro tail-lights into US spec Bus

Hello to the Lists,
I found some cool European rear lenses, bulb holders (dual bulbs in each) and seals so thought I would fit them into my 1970 Westfalia.

I have read some of the archives regarding Euro (Red/Orange) tail lights being retrofitted into North American spec busses.  The article I paid attention to was the one from Matt Roberds.  I followed his instructions wiring the two running lights together then attached the turn signals and brake lights.  Now my problem is when I step on the brakes, my brake lights are now my flashers (orange lights).  How does one separate the turn signal/brake light wire?  Is this physically possible without running a new wire from somewhere?  Somebody must have performed this operation!

Thanks in advance!
Paul Klein
