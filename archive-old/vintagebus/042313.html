&gt; &lt;&lt; Is the fuel cap in a 60 single cab supposed to be vented?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi John,
&gt; You bet it it should in at least all 1949-67 buses.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; My new cheapo repo is not, and with no gauge sender or other leaky places 

&gt; Yes it will.  Have known some to end up crushing the sender due to this!

I'll solidly second this.  My once-mint condition original tank in my 66
was crushed after 2 fillups from a nonvented RMM cap.  Mashed the sender
pretty bad to.

Contacted RMM, they stated that they knew about this problem, and that
every cap they sell is not vented.  They also claimed that no one makes an
aftermarket cap for splits that IS vented.  They also refused to replace
the tank, sender, or even refund the $ for the cap.

alas.
