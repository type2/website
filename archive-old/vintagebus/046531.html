&quot;The truck bumper does exist, it is indeed more squared-off than the bus

Well that's just GREAT!!!!  I'm so proud. . .  Now ALL you single/double
cab &quot;truck&quot; owners can just send those ugly, incorrect, non-lookin'
right, obsolete &quot;bus&quot; bumpers straight to ME.  I wouldn't want to be
accused of encouraging folks to &quot;customize&quot; their trucks. . . especially
around here!!  ;-)
