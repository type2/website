Beware! This sounds frighteningly familiar.
I flew to LA to pick up my '64 Sundial, which the seller assured me
was in fine running condition and in plenty good shape to drive back
to Hood CA. He even took it to an LA VW mechanic for a tuneup and
lube. The mechanic didn't see anything amiss. I drove it around LA a
bit, and indeed it seemed just fine. Compression, oil pressure, etc.
was all good, and I thought I had nothing to worry about. But less
than 100 miles outside LA disaster struck: rod through the case. Why?
When I finally got the bus home (trailer) and started tearing into the
deceased engine, I found the spaces between cylinders to be just
packed tight with a hardened mixture of motor oil and sand. Rust-free
desert bus, you see. Had I trailered the bus home in the first place I
could have saved that engine. I had no idea and there was no obvious
sign. I even pulled the engine myself in LA to put in a new generator,
and didn't see the problem. Be careful, if you are going to drive it
home maybe you should pull a little engine tin and get a better look
at the motor you expect to be carrying you home. I had a hellish
journey home (hitch-hiking in USA just plain sucks) and wouldn't wish
that upon anybody.
Good luck, and congratulations on your new bus,
Joel
'64 Sundial (with unnecessary and expensive new engine, wish I could
have spent the $ on a new tranny instead)

Original Message:
After more than two months of searching I found a suitable bus to buy;
a 1963
Riviera. The bus has 69,000 original miles and is supposedly in
excellent
original condition including original engine. I am buying the bus from
David
Ireland in Salt Lake City Utah; anybody know him or know of him?

My plan is to fly out there this Sunday July 1st and drive it back
home to
Wisconsin over a 2.5 day period. I have joined the AIRS and emailed
some
members along my intended route. The replies have been outstanding,
what a
great community to be a part of.

It has been recommended that I take along an extra fan belt; any other
things
to watch out for? The bus will have recieved a tune-up prior to
departcher.

Thanks everyone,
Jay Cronen
Sheboygan, Wisconsin
