&lt;&lt; broke my original non frosted oem windshield trying to install it. &gt;&gt;

Hi VWbus,
Did you start to pull the window seal into the body frame at bottom center?  
If not you are pretty much guaranteed to shatter the glass due to the tapered 
shape of the window opening.  Plus using roofing tar as a sealant painted on 
the the body opening also lubricates the window seal and allows it to pop in 
way easier.  Eric&amp;Barb

- -   = = = = =  --- - 

FWIW I have always started pulling the string to start the lip of the seal 
over the window edge at the middle of the top, and never broke a windsheild.  
 I do oil  the channel I put the string in, as it makes pulling the rubber 
lip easier  (started this after I saw the string cutting into the rubber), 
and I oil the face of the seal where it will seat against the body,  and even 
use wd 40 also as it's a thinner lube.         I have seen glass break during 
installation, once 3 pieces one after another original windsheilds... boy was 
mike pissed!!!!   Then he cut up that weather strip into little pieces and 
jumped up and down on it.  Using another seal the next windsheild did not 
break.   Also if your rubber was cold it could be less flexible?    Did you 
(or your helper) spread out your fingers with palms flat against glass 
pressing in gently yet firmly using both hands, so as to not press hard in a 
small area, but distribute the pressure?     I have had more trouble fitting 
non original windsheids, as they are cut slightly different, and have a diff 
thickness, than the original.    I replaced the windsheild in my bug 
recently, the new glass was made in Brasil by Sekurit !!!  and fit 
beautifully.    I have been priveledged to use NOS seals a few times, and 
they are so much sweeter than the reproes.   Molded corners.  drool.  
practically install themselves.
