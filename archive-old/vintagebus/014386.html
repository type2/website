I've replaced the half-worn-out Uniroyal Laredos (195/75R15, C) on my
front wheels with new Bridgestone RD603s (185R14, D).  The same
Bridgstones are on the back wheels.

After the first couple of drives I'm surprised at how different the
handling is.  The steering effort is much lighter at low speed.  The
bus seems much more nimble around town.  The ride is smoother, as would
be expected with the taller aspect ratio, and I can even sense the
slightly-higher (about 1/2 inch) front height!  

It's amazing how you get &quot;tuned&quot; to the state of a bus and the smallest
change tends to stand out.

Haven't had the chance to take them out on the highway, but on our
50MPH streets they are working fine.

The Uniroyals will be kept as spares, and to serve as snow tires, as
the Bridgestones are not rated M+S.

I bought the Uniroyals by mistake (I listened to the tire guy) before I
figures out what was really going on with bus tires.  I'm much happier
now.
