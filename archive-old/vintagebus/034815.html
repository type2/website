&lt;&lt; What super bus do you all drive?  This sounds more like Ronnie's speeds in 
a
 fully prepared bus, not just bought with unknowns. &gt;&gt;
Hi P&amp;C,
Normally we drive our 1960 panel camper conversion with 1641cc SP and 3.875 
R&amp;P  freeway flier tranny on long trips.  Going to and from Seattle to 
Olympia which is a 80 mile one way trip (Including about a five mile section 
in a 50 MPH zone.) we often get this trip done in 80 minutes (60 MPH average) 
to 90 minutes (53 MPH average) minutes even with the hills/winds we have out 
here while trying to do 62-63 MPH at about 2,800 RPM.
  Drove our 1963 SC with big bore 40HP and 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier tranny 
this last weekend and took carefull note of time these same trips took.  
Results 105 minutes (45.71 MPH average) to Oly against a small head wind and 
100 minutes (48 MPH average) to Seattle going with the wind while trying to 
do about 60-62 MPH at about 3,000 RPM.
  Most likely the fellow in question is going to be driving a 1600cc engine 
with hopefully at least a stock 1960-67 tranny.  With this lower gearing he 
should be able to hold a 45-50 MPH average easily especially since he should 
be traveling with an almost empty bus.  If not, one can do eight hour driving 
days to make up the differance if they drive four hours in the morning, lunch 
and take a nap then do four more hours of driving in the afternoon/evening.  
Also taking breaks to walk around for about fifteen minutes every two or so 
hours really helps.
  Yes, with any unknown bus there is the good possibility of having break 
downs and slow downs due to bad mechanicals.  Hopefully he will change the 
tranny/engine oil, fill the steering box, tune the engine and install some 
new parts such as plugs, points, rotor, distributor, etc......  Then change 
the engine oil at least once on the trip if not more times if it gets real 
dirty fast visably on the dip stick.   Plus carry lots of tools, tach, spare 
parts and oils just in case!  With all of this above hopefully he can keep 
down time to a minimum!  Eric&amp;Barb
