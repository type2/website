Subject: Cheers,Dave Palmer!

I have never met Dave Palmer but i hope at some point
to install a pair of his safaris. My bus boys are
well, you know! 
Anyway, I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if
everyone who produced an aftermarket part for a bus
took as much time as he did to get it right. It would
sure save a lot of headaches, that's for sure.
