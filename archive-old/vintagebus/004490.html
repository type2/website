I had the same problem when I first fired mine up. Red wire with fuse and (I
believe) the gray wire were hooked to pos. The Brown was hooked to neg. The
pump wouldn't start till I turned the spring loaded screw on the bottom of
the flame switch counter clockwise a quarter turn. This started the pump and
Viola! I had heat! I was advised not to run the heater without the temp.
regulator in line as to not over heat the furnace.
