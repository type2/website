Ken,
   I didn't know Bob wasn't on the list. I've seen him post stuff on it so I
figured he was on it. No it isn't fair that he can't defend himself. But I
am not going to do battle with him either. For sure not on the list.
   Honestly, you are the only one that has sent me anything standing up for
Bob. One other person said I should let it go. All of the other mail I've
received ( which surprisingly enough has not been overwhelming) says that
they have had a similar experience. So I guess he wasn't having a bad day.
   Bob's original reply to me gave only one piece of advice, buy a Toyota. I
am not kidding. He did not have one nice thing to say about VWs in general.
   I see all of the people on the list praising the 'Sermons' and adding to
the Hoover Hoopla. That's their opinion, fine. But I'm willing to bet if
most of those people ever met Bob or had any personal contact with him that
they would be very disappointed.
   I get a newsletter from a club that reprints a portion of the Sermons.
They do have permission to do so. I don't read them anymore. I skip over
them. I don't go to them on the internet either and I delete any and all
messages related to such. So I don't whine and mewl and still make use of
his writings. I don't want to be a hypocrite like Bob and his Toyotas.

Rick
