&gt;and you'll see the alternative.  So unfortunately, sometimes you have to
&gt;take the good with the bad.  And to be fair, Motorworks doesn't screw up
&gt;orders all that often, so this was the exception rather than the rule.]

I agree.  I've ordered from the bus depot many times and am 110% satisfied.
Steve Johnson, one of our listess, visited Ron's outfit and he said there
was a lot going on in a small space.  It's Ron's devotion to the VW arena
and his low overhead that allows him to have the lowest price on any VW
parts _bar_none_.  I'll continue to deal with the Bus Depot and recommend
them to anyone I run across who needs to order parts.

If everytime someone ordered and received their item from Ron posted a
&quot;good&quot; letter to the list, we'd literally have a daily flood of good
e-mails.  One could only expect a hit-or-miss 'bad' message occasionally.
It's this slow to commend (and lack of bandwidth), quick to criticize world
we live in that can really skew a person's perception of a business.

I would suggest that anyone who really finds dealing with the Bus Depot an
unpleasant experience, to order direct from RMMW or any other VW outlet and
be sure to post how much more money you spent with them than with Ron.  Also
make sure to post everytime you have a bad experience with any other outfit
(to be fair.)

Of course I'm saying to &quot;post&quot; with a tongue-in-cheek approach.

I'm not being paid to say this nor to I work for The Bus Depot.  I am not
related to him in anyway and I did not supply him with that &quot;Meep Meep&quot; horn
you hear on his web page.  I'm just a satisifed customer who thinks that any
critiquing(sp?) should be met with some positives.
