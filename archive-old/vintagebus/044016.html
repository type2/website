I too have a Westy that has the &quot;UT&quot; code and the original owner said he
bought it overseas when he was stationed there in the army, new.  When he
was shipped back to the States, he had it shipped too.

&gt; Off the top of my head, I can tell you that you have a bus that was ordered for pick up in Germany and then shipped back to the States.  &quot;UT&quot; stands for United States &quot;tourist&quot; delevery.  Is this bus a camper?
