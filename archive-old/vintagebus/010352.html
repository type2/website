I've used Castrol 30W all year round in 1600SP engines for 22 years and
300,000 miles.

For 200,000 of those miles I was running an external oil cooler with an oil
filter in the circuit.  And for 143,000 of those miles the engine had a
heavy duty oil pump.  The filter used a standard &quot;Ford&quot; screw-on cartridge.
All the hose connections were the push-on type, with barbed fittings and
hose clamps. This setup endured all sorts of temperature extremes, including
innumerable cold starts in zero or even sub-zero conditions.  In all those
years and miles with this system I never had a problem with blown filters,
seals, or coolers, or with oil leaks of any kind.

Because of this experience I have a difficult time accepting that various
engine problems are due to &quot;thick oil&quot;.  I'm _not_ saying cold starts with
high viscosity oil never cause blown seals/coolers/filters, just that such
claims puzzle me based on my own experience.

More dumb luck on my part, I guess.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  the theories behind oil are many...all i know is what i have beeen
using...for a little over two years without any problems-that could be
attributed to the type of oil i am using-Castrol 30W.

I decided to use this oil as the previous owner was using it and recommended
it...and said to just use that oil-don't change it.  &lt;&lt;
