Subject: [VB]  WTB  complete gearshift housing for a '64 big nut trans? 

The spare trans(complete side to side) I've got the DCO cut off the
gearshift by sawszalling the coupling on the trans side(bad day).      By
reading the Bentley it looks like the gearshift housing comes off as one
unit?            Background= '63 camper will not select gears in the right
place, I've tried every ajustment I could think of(took of complete
gearshift&amp; rod,couplings back to trans, put trans into neutral and put back
together)  I've got 1,3,4 but 1st you have to push down and back( like into
reverse) and there is no reverse, at least that I could find ! Looks like
I'll end up sending the '63 trans to Rancho but in the meantime I'd like to
put in the '64 big nut and try out it's gearing &amp; to see if the bigger
brakes really make a difference.      So any leads on a complete gearshift
housing ?       Lloyd in Eureka,Calif    '63 camper
