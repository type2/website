&gt; &gt;..... So, what do you get for a 44 year old double cab for 
&gt; it's birthday?

I got my bug new taillight lenses and fixed the reverse lights (which had never worked since I got the car) for our 10 year anniversary.  

I've taken my '61 to the  Kelly Park show for its 40th birthday  (or was it Red Barn?)

I thought I was the only one who did dumb things like that.

ya, flames on the spring plates..  kewl, dood.
