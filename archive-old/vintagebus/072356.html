Subject: Re: [VB] headliner questions

I got sold a headliner that was just too damn small. Well anyways here
are some pictures of my awful headliner, anybody help?? Please! john

Nobody wants to back up and start all over but I'm thinking you should
tumble the headliner in a clothes dryer or lay it in the sun for a while
to warm.
The pre warming made a world of difference when I recovered the seats on
my 66.
