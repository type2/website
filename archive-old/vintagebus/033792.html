&lt;&lt;  can't for the life of me figure out what is supposed to be different 
between
 a bus heat exchanger and a bug one (fresh air)!  I'm at a bone yard with my
 old one and I see that he has a bunch of used ones - but they all look the
 same!  Mine was never hooked up so I don't know if it was right for the bus..
 
 If they are different, will a bug one work?  Why are they different? *I'm 
sooo
 confused*
  &gt;&gt;
bug ones are the same as splitty ones,

the bay window ones the attachment for the heat cables is different, 
otherwise they are the same.
