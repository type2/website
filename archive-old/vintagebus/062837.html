Subject: RE: [VB] A/C for a Baywindow

  I.C.E. in San Diego. They do not sell a KIT for a bay window, but will
sell you all the components to do it. They told me to bring the bus in and
let them install the AC. I said all I want is components, mounting brackets,
switchs, relays and all assorted parts necessary for the install. I will
have all the hoses made here. I now have all I need to install the air in my
60 DC except the compressor mounting bracket for the European 356 Porsche
engine I am going to put in it.

Subject: [VB] A/C for a Baywindow


Hey everyone,

A buddy of mine is in serious need of an A/C system for a '72 bus.  Can
anyone direct me/him to a seller of A/C kits?

There used to be a place that offered the whole kit but I cannot remember
what shop.

At worst case we can salvage a lot of it from junkyards since it was a
dealer accessory, but he would rather have something that is known to be
good right off the bat.

His motor is a Jake Raby built T4 2.0+ so it should have no problem running
the compressor.  Hopefully a Sanden one over the old York.


Thanks for your help!
