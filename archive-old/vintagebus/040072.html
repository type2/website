Reminds me of a line from an original 'Coneheads' skit on SNL--'Astronauts 
on
the moon?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!'   67 Deluxe manual?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

But seriously, the '67 Deluxe owner's manual might as well be the Holy 
Grail.
No one selling auto literature on the Internet ever has one.  About once a
year you may find one on eBay.  The last one I saw there was mint and sold 
for
over $140.

Good luck on your quest.
