Subject: re: [VB] Aridzona Fires - Report from Rob Muir

Have been a resident of Phoenix (Arizona with no D) since 1956 and have NEVER
seen dry like this season. Was a member of a hotshot crew during of summer
1974-75 and never saw anything like this year. Crowning tree fires were thought
to be for the radical Wyoming/Montana/Idaho/Washinton/Oregon fires. Have always
thought that Arizona/New Mexico fires were God's way of cleaning out the
underbrush- not to decimate the entire forest... &lt;sigh&gt;
Heard statistics today that stated that kiln dried lumber at the average lumber
yards is dried to 15% dryness. The living Arizona NORTHERN Arizona forests are
at 6%. You can imagine what the Southern Arizona territories are like. 
Dave and Cee Eccels taking Holiday in the USA? Great! but strongly suggest
areas north and west of Arizona.
Ya'll adjust the valves at 6 straight across and lift a thought, but please
don't light a candle, for Arizona.
