was writ:
&quot;you should take your old engine and just start rebuilding it! That way  you
can take the time to do it right, which only you can/will do it. Then in a
year or so you will have a spare engine and the knowledge that you did it
yourself! Eric&amp;Barb&quot;

well the case has already been bored out once, and i was told that it was not
a good idea to bore it out twice(align bored) The crankshaft needs so much
work to fix, i was told it would be cheaper to buy a new one, same for fly
wheel. plus if they were fixed they would be weaker. then the bearings are
shot, the p&amp;c are borderline.

what is worth saving is the oil cooler(although it is not a doghouse) my heads
were good, camshaft, heads, i will try to save what is good. 

also i am moving again soon, i can't imagine it being worth the effort to move
the case...
