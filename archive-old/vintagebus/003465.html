&gt;&gt; And you expect to have room for luggage AND people as well?  You'd be
lucky
&gt;&gt; to fit all that stuff in a bus with you passengers, and if driving a
pickup,
&gt;&gt; I guess be prepared to fill the entire cargo area up with parts!


I carry at least that much stuff, plus enough extra food &amp; other necessities
to handle a few head of extras when we go on the road. All stowed. Nearly
all of the tools are in a 6 drawer lockable add-on cabinet from Craftsman.
About 8W x 14H x 12 D. No problem, switches from the limo to the singlecab
in a jiffy. The parts are in a small divided plastic case from Kmart and a
500 round ammo can from the army surplus.
Ground cloth or board fits under the rear cargo area mat, floor jack under
the rear seat, oil and stuff under the clothes in the closet. Piece of cake.
I do my tune-ups right out of the parts boxes, swapping the rebuilt dizzy in
and getting the other one fixed up later. Oil changes, etc. keep the fluids
fresh. I can service the VW at work if I get bored. In my old '63 I did a
roadside rebuild on a guys engine with parts from my onboard stash. I think
a set of pistons and cylinders and bearings may be a bit extreme, but I
lived in a townhouse complex and had nowhere else to keep them anyway.
Still, no part or tool is more useless than the one left at home when you
break down on the road. I seldom use this stuff for my ride anyhow, mostly
for the folks who's cellphone battery is dead.  8^)
