Here's a project for somebody: collect measurements of all of the 
Westfalia kits, draw them all to the same scale(s), and publish the 
drawing and information as a CD. (Maybe Ron Salmon would distribute)? 
There should be enough information in the drawings and measurements to 
repair a cabinet or part, or to make one from scratch. Also, information 
about proprietary stains and varnishes that match originals, sources for 
exact or close hardware, etc. 

(Then there are also Devons, Sundials, E-Z Campers, Rivieras, etc. But 
lets not go there).

A similar project , not practical in quite the same way, would be for 
someone to make a &quot;coloring book&quot; of bus assemblies (like the human 
anatomy coloring book, etc.). It would be great for learning, and a super 
supplement to Muir.

As I'm still thinking about making harnesses, I toss these out for 
someone else.
