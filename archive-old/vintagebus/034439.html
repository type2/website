To get really technical, the brake drums, stub axles, etc., were 2 month only
M215 parts.  These were indeed later 64-67 (rear shoes) on an early small 
spline
type stub axle, which is about 1/2&quot; longer, ask me how I know!  Some d_at_mn PO 
put
one of these in my 65 deluxe.  What a nightmare.  Turned out that Bill &amp; 
Steve's
 -- - - --
actually the 63 M 215 option was available more than 2 months- think the 
entire 63 model year it was available.  (But I have not checked any 
refenences for that )  Why do you say it was only used 2 months?
