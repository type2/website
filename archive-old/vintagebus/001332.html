This afternoon I went out to the guru's shop and he helped me set the
endplay on this engine.  Of course he goes through the usual chiding and
critique of my engine building skills which goes along with a trip to his
shop.  I hear what he does and how it's worked better than the way I did
something, etc.  It used to make me mad to hear him talk like that but not
anymore.  It's humbling (something I have a problem with anyway) to say the
least but one thing we have both agreed on is that there is nothing like
experience to help you make decisions as to what YOU want to do with your
engine.

Ernie showed me the pictures of an engine that came into his shop which had
a sudden and catastrophic lock up.  What had happened was the shaft in the
oil pump that does not contact the cam (the non-driven-gear shaft) had come
loose and launched itself into the cam nuts and totally shattered the cam
gear, stripping teeth off of it in the process.  Nasty nasty nasty.  His
concern was whether or not I peened the shaft in place on my pump.  Of
course I hadn't and he said that I'd probably be alright.  He's never had
one come loose on him but at the same time, Ernie told me he's always peened
them too so who's to say?

I was able to talk to Ernie about his engine building history this time and
learn a little more about him.  Ernie learned about VW repair from an old
guy in California who had 20 years of engine building experience under his
belt.  This was in 1970.  The old guy has since passed away but Ernie spoke
highly of him but never mentioned his name.

Anyway, my endplay had been set correctly all along.  Ernie likes .004 and
spec is .003 to .005  I found out the Ernie vehemently dislikes assembly
grease.  &quot;I only use oil,&quot; I heard him mumble repeatedly.  The grease I had
on the shims was the reason why I couldn't set the endplay properly.  That
must be done with totally dry parts in order to set it accurately.  I
learned something new yet again.  Interestingly, the shims which originally
came off of this engine are the same 3 that are on it now and it's right in
spec.  Neat.

The only other thing I found shocking was that Ernie never bothers to check
compression.  He told me he just bolts them together and runs 'em.  He
primarily does stock engine rebuilds on cases that haven't been refaced on
the cylinder bores.  He did agree that checking the compression on a faced
case would be a good idea.

So I guess on the next rebuild, I'll try it without the grease and see what
happens.  I was just concerned that since it's going to be a while before
the engine is run, that the oil might all run off and leave me with dry
parts.  This way they at least will be lubed up on the initial start-up.

I'll have more to tell later.  I'm traveling the 80 miles to get my heads
and then I'll be all systems go.  James Lindsay chatted with me at length
about how to check the compression and cc the heads.  I understand it and
I'm ready!

Later
