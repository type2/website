I just bought a '62 bus, so I thought I would subscribe to the list. Is 
there anyone out there from Florida? Close to Gainesville would be nice. 
I need a few things for the '62, so if anyone has parts to sell, please 
email me off list. The bus had been or started to be changed over to 
12v. Im not sure what all was done, but I know it has a 12V regulator. 
The lights do not work at all. Does anyone have any suggestions as to 
what I should look for as far as it being changed over? I know I need 
windshield wipers. Will any years fit or will I need to find a '67?

Congrats on the new bus!  

There are a lot of parts on a bus, so you might want to srt out a want list.
DO you know if the 6-&gt; 12V conversion was completed?  There is a lot on that
process in the list archives.   You can also use a test light at the lights to
see if they are getting power- a lot of times just cleaning up the connections
and grounds does wonders.  And sometimes fuses or bulbs are bad.   You want to
make sure ALL your bulbs are 12V, including the ones in the overhead lights.
Use only 5W bulbs in the dome lights, or the plastic covers will melt.  If no
covers, then 10W works, just dont put the covers on unles you use 5W bulbs.

You should consider getting a copy of the Bentley reprint of the 63 ed. of the
VW Transporter Workshop manual.   Yeah, a year later than your bus (it was
made for 63-67), but has stuff on the body, rear axle, front
suspension/steering, wiring diagrams (62 is the same as 63) and all kinds of
useful info you can't get in any other book.    And an Idiot guide (by John
Muir) if you dont have one.

The wiper blades and arms from any splitty bus can be used.   The wiper motor
should get a voltage drop.  A 67 wiper motor would only fit if you mash the
heat tube, which can be done, but I personally wouldn't do.   Besides, the
65-67 style wiper motor is a PITA with the pivots that break and harder to get
parts for.   I like the 55-64 better.

Hope it's a driver soon.  :)
