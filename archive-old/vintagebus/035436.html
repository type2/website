was writ:

Chuck Notmeyer has a very early '67 Kombi.
Build date of July 6, 1966, VIN 000559,
probably on the first day of '67 production.

My Deluxe was built on October 5, VIN 036384.
Chuck's has backup lights, mine doesn't.
I have the later 7 1/4&quot; wide radio opening.
Don't know about his yet.

Any other data points out there I can add?
Come on people, we need to fill Clara's head
with almost useless bus trivia, such as 
when the radio opening and Bl were changed
in the 67 busses.
 -- - - -         -------------------
The back up lights were a mid year change.  Either his were an option, or were
retrofitted (if you pull them off- is there paint around there?)  Not sure of
exact date.   Similar to how the dual circuit master cylinder was a mid year
change- not all 67 buses came with them.  My head is already filled with
ridiculous bits of bus trivia, oh dear,  the dual circuit master cylinder was
standard before backup lights, however.
.  .  ... . . 
On the dash oopening, the Split Guide indicates
that for those supplied without radios, the 
radio hole was blocked with a Beetle radio cover.

This implies that a Beetle radio of the correct
vintage would not only fit into the late '67 opening,
but would also be correct.
- - - - -  ---
the difference between the 67 radio block out plate and the beetle one is the
beetle one has holes drilled in it for the chrome dash trim.  You can use a
beetle one if you dont mind the holes.  There may be a clip differnce.  oh
cool- you got the thing I can check-  

211 805 181 Cover plate- radio grill up to chassis no 216 190 000
111 805 233A   Cover plate- radio grill from ch No 217 000 000

which mean the dash radio hole change was on the first bus of the 67 model
year.   

Also, yes the block out plate for 67 is a bug parrt (number starts with 111)

The guy whose early 67 has the smaller hole  may have had a nose/dash
transplant.  I mean the bus, not the guy.  

also odd the info you wrote as the beginning of the model year is Aug 1st, and
you said your friends bus was made in July.  Perhaps something was misread.
