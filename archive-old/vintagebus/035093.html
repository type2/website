&lt;&lt; try as we may the rear drivers turn signal refuses to work. all 3 other 
flash happily. turn on the flashers and all 4 flash. with all 4 flashing I am 
under the assumption that the wiring to the light is good. including the fuse 
too. do I assume too much? I am leaning towards the flasher. I have reseated 
all the connectors on it. removed the fuses cleaned and turned over swapped 
locations etc. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rory,
Sounds like a bad wire somewhere immeadiately aroung the turn signal switch 
or the switch itself.   Eric&amp;Barb
