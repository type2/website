Subject: Split bus prices

Ronnie and I both sold split buses this weekend. A lot of listies ask
what there bus is worth, a hard ???? to answer. Following is an honest
discription and selling price of each bus, maybe this will help on the
difference between asking and selling price. Asking price might be
$5000.00 and seller thinks its worth that much but selling price is
what makes the difference. My 67 hardtop walkthru deluxe sold for $3000
and Sharman drove it back to Phoenix, az. It was a clean bus with all
seats ( new TMI covers on all) full roof rack, 1600 s/p,67 b/n trans,
all deluxe trim and glass good, missing rr bumper,w/w tires good,brakes
good, body still had a few minor dents but little rust. Headliner had
some tears and non stock interior panels. It was a bus you could drive
anywhere and work on as you wished. I was ashing $3200 and sold for $3k.
Ronnies was a 64 low rider kombi with full bus boys front and rear
converson. 1600 s/p and also a very good driver in primer and no
interior at all. Sold for $2000. Hopefully this will give some true
selling prices, not inflated $10000.00 prices on good driving easy to
restore splits. Both these buses were rust free and only minor body
work to paint.

see you in vegas and buses by the bridge and tucson.
