Mike,


 Look for a non-quartz Mercedes Benz round clock from a junk or salvage yard. 
The back is identical to the Bus clock and has all the winding mechanisms and 
you can use the front knob to set the time. Easy transplant and 12v.  


 If you can't find one, I have an extra you can have for the shipping and 
pintage costs.

&gt; The winder mechanism in my clock is burnt out. I have heard you can put the 
&gt; gubbins from a battery powerd clock in its place. Does any one know where I can 
&gt; get one from in the UK . What mechanism to use. TIA Mike
