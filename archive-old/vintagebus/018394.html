I don't know if any of you recall a year or so ago when eBay announced
they were changing their reserve policy: the new policy would require
the opening bid to be x% of the reserve price.  A tremendous hue and
cry resulted, and ebay backed down.  I think they shoulda stuck with it;
it would have prevented a lot of bullsh*t.
