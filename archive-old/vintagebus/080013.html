&gt;What size wrench do i need to buy to take the spindle
nut off? I don't have my bus with me or I'd check.

&gt;We use a 12&quot;  cresent
OK I went down to the barnyard and pried off the dust
cap for a look.
my cresent is too small by about 1mm so I hitched a
ride to the salvage store and bought a big enough
cresent but its too big to get any double nut action
going on. the cresent works on the outside but to
bring the inside nut up snug i need a thinner wrench.
I need to go to a sears craftsmen website and order a
wrench, but what size?
