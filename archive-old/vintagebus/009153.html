Subject: Re: [VB] difference between middle seat bay and split ??

... beg to differ concerning the holes in the rails for a '67 (not that that
trivia is going to change the world &lt;&lt;grin&gt;&gt;)
The (original) middle seat on my '67 does not have holes in the rails.
There is a clip that connects to the nub and bolts over the top of the rail;
there are eight of them total.  I know this to be a fact as just this AM I
pulled the middle seat out of the bus so I can haul an RV generator to the
loal repair shop tomorrow.

&gt; 1967 (one year onlyish ) has holes in the rails for the nubs.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There's differences, but a bay seat will _fit_ in a split.  The bay seats
also
&gt; &gt;use the seat clamps with nubs on them as opposed to the split kind, which
are
&gt; &gt;smooth.  The nubs go into holes on the seat legs.
