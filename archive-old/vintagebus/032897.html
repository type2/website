I used this black PERMATEK stuff I got at the local auto parts store.
Never a drop on the ground.

&lt;&lt;Hi Peoples...


I have a brand-new 1600 sp in my '67 Kombi, and I find it interesting that

there is already a growing spot of oil on my garage floor.  I drove this

vehicle once, and although I had noted some oil under there before, did not

see any sign of leakage once it was going.  The PO, who built this engine,

did not use any sealant of any kind when he mated the case halves, as there

were no instructions to do so in the manual.  I, however, have found that

&quot;in a perfect world&quot; scenarios do not apply to VW's, and that a small amount

of blue RTV could work wonders.  Are VW's chronic leakers?  I've had 6, and

except for the one engine I rebuilt using blue RTV, they all leaked enough

to require a good wipe at every fill-up or so......what gives?
