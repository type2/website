Subject: 1st road trip, any suggestions?
Message-ID: &lt;dad6bce0.249e8deb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

     I am planning my first short trip in my bus and i was wondering if any 
of you have any suggestions to keep it from going badly.

I have a 64 with a new 1600 DP with just under 1000 miles on it. i plan on 
changing the oil, checking the points, and adjusting valves before i begin. 
the trip will be from wichita, KS to Kansas City KS, about 400 miles round 
trip. i will also be hauling 4-5 other people in the bus with me.
I plan on taking my tool set, an extra case of oil, and 2 extra fan belts 
with me, am i forgetting anything?
