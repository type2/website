&lt;&lt; I have to agree about the gas line routing...I have more than once gotten
 gasoline into my eyes, despite wearing safety goggles!  I hate that thing
 :-)  Just can't seem to get it plugged/back on fast enough.
 
 Anyway, I think I'll try running the line on the '67 through the body as
 you're thinking the next time I play the engine pull game.  It would make
 engine R&amp;I much cleaner and less hazardous and I don't think it'll detract
 at all from the appearance.  Just put a shut-off behind the new hole...hmm.
 I want to try it!  I can't think of any possible problems as long as I throw
 a grommet into the new hole.  Heck, and one of the POs cut a hole for a BN4
 cable already, so I can use that one!

I solved the gasoline in eyes probalem by 

1 dropping the motor down a few inches first  , then reaching over the motor 
to get to the fuel line

then using vise grips or fuel line clamps

then pulling the hose off the metal line.

look ma, no gas in eyes!!!    

installation is the reverse of the procedure.

I wouldn't put a shut off valve on the forward side of the metal there, and 
next ownere (NO?) may not know it was there. 

  I do think this routing  may have something to do with that buses came with 
fuel taps through 61- eleven years- so you shut the tap before pulling motor, 
right
