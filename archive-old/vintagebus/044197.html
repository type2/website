Actually, I had just been back there about 3 days ago checking oil (the fuel leak day was the first day I had driven it since this check), and 3 days before that replacing a carb.  This leak was a brand new development, it was small, and now it is fixed.  The reason I found it while it was still new and small is becuase I do check it out every couple of days.  The recent thread about fuel filters just prompted me to go out, right then at that moment, and check the condition of the filter.  Coincidence that the leak happened just after the thread on fuel filter issues.  So, I will take all the reprimands that I deserve when it comes to mechanical neglect, and I'm sure there are many ;), however, this circumstance was more of a &quot;See why you want to check back there&quot; scenario and not a &quot;See what happens when you don't check back there&quot; scenario.
Peace, John Baker

     MY MESSAGE: 
 how often do you check your oil?  lubricate your distributor (if
applicable)?  didn't you smell gas?   
  it seems to me that not very many of us look back there often enough. 
it's also sad to me that a discussion on a list prommpted someone to check
their engine compartment.  this should be a ritual!  not that you need to
put a video camera in there to look at all times, but it only takes a
couple minutes to pop the lid an scope things out.  plus i'd think that
even if you'd drive your bus only to the supermarket, you can smell what's
going on in the engine (excessive heat, raw gas, etc...) or glance
underneath for puddles of leaking juices. 
  again, i must express my thoughts---these are old vehicles.  they are not
mazdas, 6cyl passats, or even a (insert your favorite american car here),
with modern brakes, engines, maintenance schedules, etc.
  my owners manuals clearly state: &quot; BEFORE YOU DRIVE AWAY (in big, bold
black letters) please check:  engine oil level, fan belt tension, quantity
of fuel in the fuel tank, tire pressures, efficiency of brakes, position of
the rear view mirror, and,if driving at night or in foggy weather,  the
exterior lights.&quot; 
  now, i may be a snob about stuff, but even i don't do this every time,
but i do check stuff a few times a week, and if i notice an electrical
problem while driving, i fix it as soon as possible, since i like people to
see me turning and stopping. i noticed a puddle of gear oil under my car
last weekend, and yesterday i replaced both axle boots.  a dirty way to
spend an hour, but now it's fixed and i don't need to worry about it.  
  people here have been worrying about driving long distances on their
&quot;mystery motors&quot; lately.  don't you ever do maintenance? you just stuck the
motor in there by means of a magician, and haven't even looked back there? 
you can't just think this is a low maintenance vehicle and drive it without
looking at stuff of performing the scheduled maintenance rituals, and doing
them even more frequently than recommended on some things. 
well, enough rambling.  why not log-off and check out your bus and do some
things that will make it happier, and you sleep better.
