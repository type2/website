Howdy Friends:

Finished stripping down the Westy over the weekend and took it into the shop yesterday to go under the knife.  Not too much needed, front right cab floor corner to be replaced, cargo door bottoms, windshield frame cleanup and a few dents pulled.  Should only come to $3000 or $4000 and be in the shop for 4 or 5 months.

My biggest challenge of the moment is to locate a donor flip hatch, or a perfect one to replace mine.  The hinge bolts on mine a close to being destroyed.  One of the four bolts has been completely sheared off at some point in its life, another is broken half way off.  Both are frozen in the hinge plates.  If one wasn't missing and the other partiallly missing I would say it could be salvaged.  The hatch itself is in great shape.

So, if anyone out there has a crappy flip hatch with good hinges and bolt assemblies, or a nice flip hatch all the way around I love to take (buy) it off your hands.

The cabinets and seat bases are progressing nicely.  All I have left to strip is the rear linen cabinet/ice box unit.  I went over the top and also stripped the insides of all the cabinets and closet, shelves and all.  Then it's time to sand and polyurethane.  There might still be a chance some winter camping down south is in the cards, but I'm not counting on it.  I just keep thinkin' of David Carradine (sp?), &quot;patience Grasshopper, don't rush a good thing.&quot;

TIA.

Robert
