Subject: Cheap Jalousie window seal!

This is the cheap way to keep those darn Jalousie window seals from leaking!  Vintage Nazis please skip ;)

I went to Home Depot and picked up a tube of GE Silicon II white caulk to seal the edges of my leaky died up seal Jalousie windows.  The GE caulk has a lifetime guarantee and claims NO SHRINKAGE or yellowing.  

I slapped it into the caulk gun and went to work.  It is straight forward, just hit the outside edges and leave room in the bottom for a moisture drain.  Use your finger to smooth it out and sqish in all the seams.  Be sure to use a rag to clean the edges and your fingers.  The caulk seemed of very high quality and adhered very well. 

Should provide a leak free camping environment for many years of enjoyment.

Take Care,
