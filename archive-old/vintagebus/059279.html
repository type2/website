Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Stolen Bug!!!! why not take the bus?

Where I live, someone would be more likely to dump off an old air cooled VW in my driveway than to take one of mine that are already there! 
Kind of one of those &quot;funny&quot; stories, a guy who lives just outside of my litle village dropped in one day and said he had this old &quot;Beetle Bug Car&quot; that he was going to have towed to the scrapper, said he always saw me working one these things in barn and wondered if I wanted his old one. If I wanted it, all I has to do was come pick it up.  So after thinking about it for about, oh, 10 seconds or so I said sure!  Went out to his place with a chain and my old pick up truck and pulled it home.  Cleaned out the mouse nests, threw an old engine in it and fired it right up.  I gave the car to my nephew and his new wife as a wedding present and they still drive it today.
This little story has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING but, hey it's Friday, right?!?!
Peace! John Baker
