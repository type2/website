Have a couple of VW wheels I need to ID. The first is a 16&quot; with NO
hubcap clips or holes for same. The wheel is welded in the 12 spots
where the rivits usally go and welded every 3&quot;s or so on the back. One guy
told me it is a war wheel. No date codes anywhere on wheel.
The next are alloy 14&quot;x6 1/2&quot; 5 lug and kinda look like early american
style Hallibrand mag wheels, again no stampings or name. They are
real lite. Thanks for any help on IDs for these wheels.

John Howard
