Steve did you drop a washer down the intake??? thats what the sound you
discribed mentally sounds like to me, I had this happen to me once on a gh#a
engine that i was working on, tore the heads off and low and behold, the
little wave washer imbedded it the head

Well,

I finished the 1600 DP with all the trimmings on Friday and finally got
around to see if it would run last night.

The background is that I did a Kyle top end rebuild (no implied
liability Kyle)on this 71 DP stock AS41 German never split case.  I put
new P/C's and heads on it and blasted/cleaned/painted everything.  New
seals, ignition, exhaust, etc.  After checking all the things I could on
the short block I figured the bottom end should be OK.  The short block
had only relatively few miles on it and it turned over smooth as butta.
The rod side clearance and bearings looked great and well with in spec,
as did the crank and end play.  About the only thing I couldn't assess
was the cam and lifters with out splitting the case. I think I should of
checked those too :-(

I hooked up the empty tranny case I have and my 8 buck junkyard self
supporting starter and all the associated wiring.  Got out the gas can
and the fire extinguisher.  Hooked up the starter switch I have and set
a 20 minute timer so I'd be sure to go the full 20 min.  I also attached
a tac/dwell meter to it and crossed my fingers.

I cranked it for about 15 seconds with the coil unhooked to get the
pressure up and stopped.  After a brief bit of cranking with the fuel
pump hoses backwards, I primed the carb with gas and she lit off.  I set
her to 2K and stood back.   Hmmm.  That sound seems different to me.  A
tic tic tic....almost but not quite a knock....hmmmm.  Hard to pin
point.  I'm thinking internal toward the front (FIF) and not the
valves.  Not bad enough to warrant a shut down, but still not what I was
planning on.  It seemed to subside by the end of the initial run in, but
not by much.   The motor didn't seem to have any pep either.  It revved
up ok, but would want to spit back through the carb upon a quick blip of
the throttle.  The timing is statically dead on and so is the carb.  The
only real exterior problem was a leaking left side rocker gasket...easy
enough to fix.

I did the rev and listen for the tell tale rattle of a bad
rod...nothing.  Just the significant tic tic tic.   I used a screw
driver to try and pin point the sound, but couldn't.  I checked the T2
sound archive, but not much help.

Any simple ideas of a quick easy fix (ha ha )?  Timing so off it's
causing a pre ignition?  Wires are not crossed...I checked.  I'm
thinking the worst here and dreading tearing the entire thing
apart...save me from my self!

It sure is pretty though...would make a nice door stop.

Ronnie I might be calling for a short block :-(
