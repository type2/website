Subject: 1300 to 1600 engine case Q

Hello all

Turns out the engine case i got with my DC is in good shape.  The S/N#
turns out to be a 1965 1300 Bug case.  (Case # F6xxxxxxx)  This case had
a 69mm stroke and i think a 77mm bore originally.  From my &quot;hot rodding
a VW engine&quot; book it said something about needing to modify the heads to
allow it to be a 1600.  I test fitted the cylinders, crank and heads and
did not find anything that looked wrong.

Any input out there?  What are the differrences in a 1300 case and a
early 1600 case?  (besides case savers, dual relief oil, larger oil pump
stud's.)  Anything that is not obviouse that i will find when i try and
mate the assy?

Thanks
