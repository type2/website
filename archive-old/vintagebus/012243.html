Subject: rear seat, bed??
Date: Tue, 08 Dec 1998 00:53:11 PST

    I want a rear seat-bed, i know that this not exist. I mean a rear 
seat to do the function of a seat and a bed in the back of my bus. I 
think i shuold need to make a experiment or invent something.

      If you have one seat like this or you have an idea, please make 
know it.


                     

                             &quot;Enjoy the life y viva el tequila!&quot;
