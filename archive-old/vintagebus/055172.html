Subject: Okrasa, Judson, and other 36hp parts for sale

Hi all,

A friend of mine is an old-skool V-dubber - he was racing them before
many of us were even born.  He's retired now, and looking to get rid
of a lot of his goodies.  He'll cut me a deal, but I need to buy his 
stash in bulk in order to save much.  And that's some cash that I don't 
have laying around, that's for sure.

Anyway - if anyone is looking for 36hp Okrasa heads, 40hp Okrasa heads, 
36hp Judson Superchargers, NOS 36hp heads, etc. - drop me a line and
let me know what you'd like.  He's got about a dozen sets of Okrasas,
and lot of other neat stuff to include (what I believe) is a (mostly
complete) '46 or '47 engine.  He's got nearly everything a guy could
ever need for a 36hp engine - most of it NOS.   This includes a bunch
of cases - some of which have never had engine numbers even stamped
on them...

He's not looking to get rich, nor am I.  But he's got somewhat of
an idea what a lot of his stuff is worth, as he's still around the
hobby.  I want a Judson and some Okrasas for one of my Ovals, and 
I'd like to get them as cheap as possible is all.  I'm hoping a few
of you will as well - and if we buy in bulk we can all save.

I'm going to cross-post this to VintageBus - I know a lot of the racing
stuff doesn't apply - but many of the 36'r engine parts will.  For now,
just pmail me your wish list, I'll assemble a list and see what kind
of buying power we potentially have.

Peace, Milo
