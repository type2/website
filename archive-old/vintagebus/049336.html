Was looking at the new, long, pre-curved, horizontal engine to body seal and looking at the '66 camper's undented seal channels and went for it. You can spend about 15 minutes and half a handful of pink liquid anti-bacterial soap and install the seal without cutting it. Push and tug a bit and the apron bolts on.
