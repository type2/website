&lt;&lt; Were there ever any panels that were placed inside the panel van?  And, 
are there any people out there with photos of their panels so as to 
reference? &gt;&gt;
Hi Christopher,
Yes, no, and yes.  One could always order what they wanted from the factory 
and Westfalia if they wanted to pay the $$ and wait for it.  Also there were 
many, many camper interiors made out of panels at the dealerships and 
aftermarket shops.  From the factory direct to the show room floor without 
special ordering then the ansewer would be no.  There was an insulated bus 
&gt;from VW and probably made/adapted by Westfalia for VW.  It came in two 
thicknesses of insulation in the cargo bay.  One about 2&quot; thick, the other 3&quot; 
thick.  It was given a SO-6 model number which is very Westfalia sounding.  
We have a sales brochure for these insulated buses and it seems they were 
maybe only offered in the late 1950s.  Eric&amp;Barb
