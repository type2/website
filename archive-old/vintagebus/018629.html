A basic organic canister respirator will handle most of the nasties,
but what you REALLY need is ventilation.  Make sure the doors are
open, and a fan is a nice bonus.

Drink lots of water, take some aspirin, and you should be OK.
I feel for you - I used that stuff to clean 40 years of grime out
of my DD's engine compartment.
