Subject: 40 HP heads - long studs

------=_NextPart_000_0009_01C24B46.961D6D20
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After searchin' and a searchin' I found some 40 hp heads.  These are NOS =
113 101 371 heads - so that means these are the long stud heads.  I =
really didn't want 371 heads, I was hoping for 373 (short stud) heads, =
but these are NOS and I got them both about $150.00 U.S. - so what could =
I do.  I plan on running the long studs for a while - given that these =
are NOS heads - but I figure I'll need one of those short stud kits that =
Muir talks of.  Anyone have any leads on the short stud kit?  I would =
expect a machinist would be able to jimmy something up but I would much =
rather just have the stud kit.  I've heard some people suggest a =
helicoil in the head and I've heard others suggest some sort of dealy =
that is bigger on the outside of the head such that when the rocker =
assembly is torqued down the stud wouldn't be able to pull through - I =
dunno.  I would just like the VW short stud kit I think.

TIA
