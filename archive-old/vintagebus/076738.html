Subject: Re: [VB] A Very Off Topic Post

sorry to hear about the health tragedies of the people in your life, best wishes.

Yes, I don't think 3 hours is unreasonable.   I personally would remove the wheel, drum, put that corner of the bus on jack stands (under the torsion tube) and pull the RGBox off the spring plate, then drill the old bolt out.   Other wise it is likely to cut into the spring plate with the drill, 

Maybe that's just fussy, but that's what I'd do.

It took me a LONG time to drill out the front shock bolt on my 53, when I finally got new shocks for it,  well that bolt had been there for 50 years and broke instead of moving out.  Those bolts are hard!!!!!  and I had to be careful to not bugger up the threads.

I got good at sharpening drill bits, though.

&gt; the right bolt .. I will worry about that, but while on that subject, so far
&gt; both mechanics say about 3 hours labor to remove the broken bolt and replace
&gt; it.  JEEZ .. one says &quot;maybe he can do it without removing it ..and would
&gt; try that first .. the other wants my money or doesn't think 
&gt; he can do it
&gt; without pulling the wheel or whatever to remove the bolt.
