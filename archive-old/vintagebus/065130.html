Subject: Re: [VB] bus seats wanted!!!!

Would anybody out here know where I can get one close by?? How do you
guys find these things??

---------------------------
Try All Foreign Auto Salvage on Elliott Reeder Road in Fort Horth.
He has nice middle, rear seat from 65/66 in Gray vinyl.
If you'rwe needing parts its worth looking at this donor van for other
stuff, he has just to one so this isn't a splittie glory hole.
