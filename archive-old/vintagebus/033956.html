Hi There,

Check out our events web page at:

http://members.aol_dot_com/OurVWs/events.html

We are maintaining a list of all the VW events in the US on this list.  We 
list the location of the show, as well as a contact number for more 
information.

If you have a web page and would like to put up a link to this page - feel 
free.

Thanks Much

Hope it helps some
