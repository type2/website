  CB Performance new 34 pict 4 duel set up blows the doors off of stock
kadrons and eat ICT's for lunch. We have dynoed all three and really find
the duel 34 solex trouble free and reliable and easy to work on, you can
gets parts anywhere for them and they made more power and torque. Dynos
don't lie

&gt; Hi Volks- has anyone who uses Kadron carbs ever had the secondary venturi
&gt; (the little circular thing in the throat of the carb) come loose and be
&gt; sucked into the engine?

I got a set from AJ and when I opened the box, the secondary venturi was
rattling loose in the box.

I've run ICT's, and I've run Kadrons, and personally, I like the ICT's a LOT
more. The quality is much better IMHO. The Kadrons are more popular though
due to the racing AJ has been doing with them.

I would recommend checking both carbs (ICT's and Kads) side by side before
you purchase, if you haven't already.
