I read a paper somewhere about this years ago. As i remember the resistance
of the wire does something wierd and the glow is as a result of the gen not
able to cope with the distance and glowing globe faintly happens even though
the battery is doing fine.
The advice was to fix the connectors in the loop, fat wire instead or stick
tape over it.

&gt; I have noticed that the red light has a  very slight glow.  I have
&gt;noticed that it tends to go away then I hit  sustained higher
&gt; RPMs as well (like when I am going 35 MPH in third gear).
