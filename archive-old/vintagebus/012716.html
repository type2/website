&gt;On an aside dad put
&gt;regular plate glass in his '66 years ago he told me once but after all
he
&gt;had the sense to realize in a front collision he was probably dead
anyway.

Questions and comments:

Ok that's fine but around here we have what's called safety inspection.
i know my kombi  won't pass with the glass that's in it (cracked drivers
side glass)
 i don't know if mr. safety inspector looks at what kind of glass is put
in a split.
he looked under my bug's back seat to see if the #'s matched with the
registration (!)
was/is your dad a motorcycle rider also?
 am i being macho if i say that safety weirds me out?
I can see looking out for the other  guy and making sure your lights and
turn signals work and being in a good state of tune to avoid collisions
and or stalls.
Oh, and having a fire extinguisher for that outer guy when his VeeDub's
gas line splits.
But siting in a antique over it's front wheels at any speed is not my
idea of a safe time.
all you unbelievers out there are better off in a volvo until you get
saved ;-)
( that otta stir up all the vegans out there; peas man, think about your
karma)
when the EMTs put me in their meatwagon (see our hero) they flipped when
i told them i didn't go through the splits windshield when i hit that
bridge. i guess they think it's a given that if a victim is't strapped in
then,-- there he goes, through the windshield!
