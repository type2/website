I bought some cheapo 205,75,15's at walmart for about $47.00 each, that's
maybe $30.00 U.S. each - rated for 1596 lbs and 100,000 mi warranty - I
searched really hard for LT's but I couldn't find any so I had to go to a P
tire - MS tires which is important here in canada. I like them and I would
buy them again if I couldn't find LT's.  Sure Walmart sucks but the do stand
behind thier warranty and the tires look really nice with the white stripe.

jdd 60 std - finally cruisin' on a 75 tire instead of the 65's i use to have
