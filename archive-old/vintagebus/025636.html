a right upper door hinge for a 67 bus?  I've a hinge pin type mirror to
mount but don't want any surprises when I remove the old hinge for
drill/press/cuss the hinge pin. Much prefer aa simple bolt in of another
hinge.   I'd be willing to send you my old one (excellent shape of
course) once the install's complete.  I'm willing to pay fair $ +
shipping.

Dave
