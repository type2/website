One has to drive the Oregon / California border to go back and forth...
requires snow tires :)  Traction tires required.

I actually went the non traction tire route as I had a set of 185R14
chains... finding the Bridgestone highway-tread 8-ply tires 185R14 was a
score.  Medford Oregon, 15 miles before you have to chain up!

I officially live in my camper, where ever that happens to be.

In further irony, it is 35 degrees at night down here in Arizona right
now... and I just purchased an electric refrig :)  $89 at Wall Mart for a
40Qrt Coleman... recommended!  Not perfect, but 4 amp draw and manageable
size for Westy. Haven't decided if I will pull my icebox (and properly store
it for later return)....

Oh yha Thom, I found those two front tires we put on at your place were
mismatched.  One was 195 and the other 205.  Yuck.  That wasn't helping
handling. I fixed that, have two new tires on front now...

  Stephen

8-ply snow tir es


What's snow?

My '54 had Hakkapeliitta studded tires on it when it came over from
Sweden, ja!

Am I the only one who notices the irony of Steve posting about snow
tires now that he's moved to AZ?

&gt; But don't try to pronounce &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot; in mixed company.  Yes,
&gt; that's how it's spelled..  I'm looking at the word right now.
