Attended last year with my '66 Westy, was surprised at the listees I was
able to meet.  No swaps at this event, but since show entry was free ,
we entered the westy with its rusted out rockers,(included a free
t-shirt, cap and some stickers). Had a lot of fun hanging out with all
the other splitty owners. 

If any one needs more info on this event or campgrounds/motels email me,
RMMW sent me a lot of info on this year's event.

Will post little bit of info about the Fineline Bug-in held Sunday
August 9th near Denver, Colorado, in a separate post.
