It has become increasingly apparent to me that organization is the key
factor in how well a restoration of a vehicle goes.  This is something that
I'm severely lacking in and has caused me numerous stupid delays over the
years.

   For example, let's say that you jack up your VW and start doing brake
work, and like an idiot, you start screwing around with the adjuster stars
and break off the little tab that prevents the star from turning.  Okay, so
you'll either have to fix it by drilling and tapping a hole and using some
spring steel banding or get a new backing plate.  The VW is due the next day
at the body shop to fix that dent in the rear quarter you caused by backing
into a post.  Since you are going to tow the VW, you just put the drum back
on so you'll have a wheel to roll on and you can put the backing plate on
later.  While the dub is at the body shop, you realize that had you put on
another set of old tires and rims you had laying around, you could have been
working over the rims you were going to use for real.

This is just a 'make believe' example of what it's like when I'm trying to
restore a vehicle.  What I want to know is if there is a flow chart or a
list available of some sort that gives an optimum order to follow while
restoring a vehicle?  It never fails that I get interrupted by some
unexpected repair and then I have one hell of a time trying to figure out
what I can be doing while I'm waiting for parts/repair/other stuff to get
done.

I suck real bad at organizing but I would venture to say this is why most
restorations take years to complete (besides working with meager spare time
allotments.)  If I have something unexpected come up, I can almost sit for
an hour on a stool in the garage trying to decide what I should do next.  It
seems my mind functions best if I can proceed in a serial fashion but oh how
I wish I was parallel minded...

Anyone else have these problems?
