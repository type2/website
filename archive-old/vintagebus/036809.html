I just looked around on there web site and found absolutely no trace of VWCC 
at all.
as if it never existed.
They wonder why it doesn't sell and they have absolutely no effort to promote 
it.
Thank you rex for your very generous offer.
In going to try to get this place (mercury news and music) to get the mag.  
I've asked several times if they have heard of or seen them and they said no. 
 im going to see if they can get it one more time and present more info about 
it when I do.  
If they don't get it I will have rex send me possibly two every quarter.

thanks for your replies
