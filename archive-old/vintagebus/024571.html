Subject: Re: EZ Camper ID Plate

I have a '66 EZ Camper and the plate you speak of is originally
pop-riveted to the passenger side immediately to the left of the cargo
door. Below the passenger door and above and behind the passenger side
front wheel. Mine also has a State of California metal tag certifying my
camper as a &quot;mobile home&quot;.
I'm assuming mine are original. Hope this helps
