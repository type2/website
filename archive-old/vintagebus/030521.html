Subject: Friday: My Lab

Since its Friday, I had to post a link to a photo of my Robotics Lab at LBCC that
I am in the process of pulling together.

The bus content: They actually pay me to do this stuff, which keeps the wheels
turning on the DC  and, not visible in the photo behind a large brown storage
unit, is my NC mill that has been know to be used to make a bus part or two.
