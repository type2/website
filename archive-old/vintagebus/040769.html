Andre:

It means the publisher of the magazine may have a history of slow-pay or
no-pay with their mailing bureau. The mailing bureau is the company that
actually puts the addresses on the magazine and drops it off at the Post
Office. Many of the mailing bureaus I've worked with require cash up front
before they'll accept your job at the loading dock. Why? Because those are
the terms they get from Uncle Sam.

I have seen some of you volks talking about the latest VW Trends magazine.
Does anybody subscribe to it? I haven't received it yet and have seen it at
the stand. Does it mean that my Mailman is going through it first before
dropping off at my mailbox?

Thanks,
