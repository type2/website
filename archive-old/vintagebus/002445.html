&gt;&gt;i drive slower - my 71 i was always pushing the envelope in, 70 on the
&gt;&gt;highway.  But in my 61, i am happy to go whatever speed, it just feels
&gt;&gt;right no matter how fast or slow i go.

Well, I envy you for being able to drive your split as mine is taking longer
and longer than expected to get back on the road but I do know that when
driving the 58 ghia with it's 36 hp engine, I don't really mind being passed
by the trucks going up long hills... yes, life seems simpler and more
carefree in an old VW.
