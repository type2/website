Subject: update on emergency brake cable

i am thinking my emergerncy brake cable is somehow locked up inside it's
tube...

well...i took the rear hub caps off, spent an entire day trying to find the
right size socket for the rear axle nut-I found 1 13/16&quot; pretty easily, but
it was 3/4&quot; drive. I only have 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2&quot;. So a bunch of phone calls
for a different socket, or an adaptor...the only thing I could find was via
a snap-on guy. he had an adaptor. no one else had anything in stock, would
take a couple days to order.

actually one of my FLAPS claimed that they had it, i repeateed exactly what
i was looking for THREE times, and he said yes, right here, got it...I went
there, and is was a 13/16&quot; socket. no apology, nothing.

anyway so today i had to do some work on my squareback(fuel lines starting
leaking like mad...so replace all of those.

I get to my bus, trying to get the rear nuts off...I practically lifted the
bus and spun the passenger side wheel...lots of penetrating oil...on both
wheels. try again with two foot cheater bar...no go.

well I guess I will leave that to soak for a while, I'll go pull the pedal
pan off, as I will need to get to the brake cable there anyway.

I notice that the base of the brake arm looks a little rusty and dry...so I
spray some penetrating lubricant all over it, and guess what...it appears
right now as that was the only problem. just needed a little oil on it's
fulcrum pivot....good news. now I need to get new cotter pins for the rear
axles!

well guess i get to drive my bus this weekend, off to a wedding, and i need
a place to crash.
