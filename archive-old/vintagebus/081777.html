&gt;&gt; This is the carb that Clara installed in her 65 a while ago - manual choke 
- but there is an electrical connection on it - maybe for the 12V idle jet?  
I'm wondering where that wire should go to - coil? &lt;&lt;
Hi Jdd,
If there is a auto shut off pliot/idle jet, it would be on the left side of 
the carb.  Thing is that if the carb ran before without an electrical 
connection there than it should work now.
&gt;&gt; I've been having trouble getting my bus started.  It hasn't run in about a 
year.  I just noticed that wire on the carb isn't hooked up - think that 
could be my problem?  &lt;&lt;
More likely you need to take the carb aprt for a full cleaning and give the 
engine a complete go over and tune up.
