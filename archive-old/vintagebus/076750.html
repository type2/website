Subject: Re: [VB] 40HP Muffler from WW

Hi Greg,
The one thing of the stock bus muffler is the pipe part of the dampener where 
it fits into the muffler is almost always not round and because of this the 
doughnut shaped exhaust seal will not seal for long if at all.  We finally gave 
up and now weld the dampener into the muffler to prevent monoxide from 
leaking there and getting into the engine compartment and into the heating system 
and into the interior.  
   If the doughnut exhaust seals are not a tight on the heat exchangers 
because these areas have rusted down you should cut off these parts of piping and 
weld on new ones.
  Plus if the sheet metal of the heat exchangers is loose around the pipe 
going in through it you should weld up in these areas, or lose heat and exhaust 
will get sucked in the rears if any exhaust leaks by the exhaust doughnuts.
    So you might want to go ahead and purchase that wire feed Mig/Tig welder!

We also have found that applying a layer of high temp silicon sealant to the 
doughnut seals that are used to seal the muffler to the heat exchangers does 
help seal them.
