Subject: Re: [VB] Another clutch question

Hi Lee,
It depends on the diaphram clutch if it is with the thrust ring or without 
type for the early or later TO bearing setup.  We would just insall a 200mm nine 
spring pressure plate which has been the only one we have found to be just 
about bomb proof in our buses.
