&gt;I'm seeking to find something to fill my newly rebuilt trans after it's
broken in.&lt;

I would strongly recommend Swepco 201 80W-90.  I am not sure of the rating
on it but it is liquid gold for trannies.  It is dino juice but has some
interesting additives that cling to the tranny gears and provide very smooth
shifting.  It is about $35 a gallon and should last 2 years or 20,000 miles.

I got turned onto it from some Porsche friends and have really enjoyed the
results in my 911.  My 911 has the 915 tranny which is a bear to shift and
is noted for not being that smooth.  The Swepco tamed it dramatically,
especially on the cold morning shifts.  I have been a slacker on putting it
in the bus but will do it in the next few weeks.

Since your e-mail has GA State on it you can get the Swepco at Automobile
Atlanta which is down the road from Marietta Polytechnical off the lower 120
loop.  http://www.autoatlanta_dot_com/.  This is not a plug for them because
their customer service is horrible, but I do not know of another local place
to get it.

Good Luck,
