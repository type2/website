My 85 year young dad titled &quot;Babcia&quot; (69 westie) over to me. He finally 
realized he is too old to drive her safely. You have to hold your mouth just 
right. :-(  I have been driving her for a while and have wanted to get her 
off his insurance to save the expense to him anyway.

Kinda sad in a way, but life goes on. Hope to have him at EVERYBUS with us 
this spring. He loved it last year.

Also have a new email address. Can any wiz kid out there give me any quick 
instructions on how to delete this account an re-up to type2 and vintagebus? 
HELP!

New address:
 
docric_at_preferred_dot_com

So far, I can tell that AOL is sooooo much easier, but had to lose the long 
distance access charges. I live in the sticks. :-)

Will need to update my airs address also.
