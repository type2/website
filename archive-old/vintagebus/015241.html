I've never seen one myself, and don't recall seeing one in
the manuals or anything.

But don't depsair: you canget one of those cool &quot;foor&quot; gas pedals, or,
go down to the hardware store and get some of that rubber non-slip,
stick-on surface stuff.  In my '56, my then-girlfriend liked to
ride with her feet up on the headlights, so I put a strip on the top of
the backside of the bucket.
