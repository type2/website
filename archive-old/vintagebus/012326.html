hey,

if anyone is interested, i added three new bus shirts to my page. you 
may want to check them out. i got a couple of responses that questioned 
&quot;where are all the bus shirts&quot; i only had one. i guess if i am going to 
advertise on the bus list i better have a few. 

Thanks, Bob Margiotti
