Subject: Re: 205M dizzy with Brosol30/31?

&gt;Can I run an original 205M dizzy with a &quot;new&quot; Brosol30/31PICT?

See below.

&gt;Which vacuum port do I use? The one I think I should use (left side)
&gt;looks really tiny...

All the engines I've seen (which is not too many compared to some on
the list) that had a vacuum can on the distributor had it plumbed off
of the left side of the carb.  One of the uses for a fitting on the
back of the carb is EGR in the later models.

&gt;The engine is a 1600sp, runs well but only just breaks 20mpg with a 115
&gt;main jet.

You probably know about it, but the &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manuals at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ will tell you the stock jetting
for damn near everything, in case you want to experiment.

&gt;
&gt;yes, you can, and should, run a 205 distributor, especially if you do a
&gt;lot of stop and go driving.

Maybe there's a more specific meaning for &quot;205&quot; that I'm not aware of,
but every single VW part number for a distributor found on
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm is a &quot;205&quot;.  The letters after
the 205 are important too.  There are three 205M distributors listed:

111 905 205M   '65 Beetle, '64-'65 Bus
113 905 205M   '68 Beetle MT, Bus
025 905 205M   '86-'90 Vanagon

On a '68 Bus, the 113 905 205M would have been on a 1600 sp with 30 PICT 2.
On a '64-'65 Bus, the 111 905 205M would have been on a 1500 with 28 PICT 1.
Either will probably work, but the '68 Bus application is closer to what
you have.  According to http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm , the
advance on the 113 905 205M comes in sooner:

113 905 205M  17-19deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 32-35deg _at_ 3.2 In. Hg
111 905 205M   5-11deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 23-28deg _at_ 3.5 In. Hg
