&gt; does anyone have any tricks on freeing stuck valves in car??

I just had to deal with this same problem. I tried using 600 grit sand
paper on the end of the valve to polish off the little bit of rust that
was causing the valve to stick in the guide, but I couldn't get it
smooth enough that way. I finally resorted to valve grinding compound.
It freed the valve up in almost no time. I spent more time trying to
clean up the mess than I did freeing the valve. I guess I have a couple
of oil changes ahead of me too, just to get rid of what's now &quot;ring and
bearing grinding compound&quot; 8^). The engine sure does run a lot better
now, though.
