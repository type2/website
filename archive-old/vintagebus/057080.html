Volks,

YES!!! They must be recharged!

A buddy of mine lost his entire bus to a broken gas line on the way home
to Napa from Redwood City when I lived in CA.  His extinguisher had no
charge, he clicked the handle and nothing.  The gauge on toward the
handle tells when to go buy another one.  I check mine when I change my
oil.  Bad enough losing a bus to not having one, even worse when you have
one that's &quot;empty.&quot;

Having a charged extinguisher saved my '61 15 window once.  The bus sat
in my driveway for nearly a year, just getting washed and started
occasionally.  It had been a while and was a cold winter, and I decided
to turn it over.  It would turn but not start.  I took a can of Starting
Fluid and sprayed in the air cleaner mouth as always, but in my haste
forgot to open the butterfly.  The starter fluid spilled out and dripped
into the engine compartment.   When I turned it over, there was enough
fluid in the air to start it, which, coincidentally, caused a
nearly-flooded induced backfire, which shot through the aircleaner, and
ended up igniting the starting fluid.  The bus sounded wierd when this
all went down, and I jumped out to open the lid in back to see FIRE! 
Grabbed my extinguisher from between the buckets and had it out
immediately, with no damage but some rippled PO paint.  

What would have happened had I not had the extinguisher handy, I have no
idea.  Talk about panic.  Keep the extinguishers handy!  You never know.
