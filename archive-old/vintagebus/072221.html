Subject: Re: [VB] The ups and downs ..

Wow.  that's a really horrible story.   my sympathies.  please tell people 
what this place is so they can be spared what happened to you, maybe post to 
that online shops list as a avoid place.   maybe you should go with that other 
mechanic you met.  Funny how they suddenly found time to work on your bus when 
you were taking it to someone else.  Sounds like they figured you for the bus 
on the back burner they could work on when they needed cake.   But that's no 
way to run a business.  Report them to the better business bureau, maybe after 
you get the motor sorted out.  they can't even attach a coil.   what losers.   
what do they think, you signed a contract to take their crap?   

Isn't there a VW club in your area?  googling on 'vw club' I found 
http://www.sevwc_dot_com/index2.html

there are a number of local chapters.  Check it out.  Might meet someone 
who'd help you 'talk' to the ex-mechanic into doing the motor right.  Not that'd 
I'd really want to take the bus back there at all, but the cost of a rebuild+ 
installation is a bit much to swallow.   explore your options.

&lt;&lt; Before starting my rant [hope you don't mind if I vent] I will post again 
the
 URL of my bus project ...
 
 www.qoam_dot_com/67bus.htm
 
 So the last time I posted I talked about a steering problem .. and the 
cracked
 &quot;case&quot; that they are supposed to replace.  NOT REPAIR ~~ I am hoping there is
 someone here on the list in the Orlando area that would like to play the part
 of either my brother, son or uncle [depending on their age.] for when it 
comes
 tThey told me they couldn't work on my bus until Thursday
 
 .....Another VW guy in town, very well known I guess with VW people,  said 
yes, he
 could do it.  I asked a price and he said &quot;3 hours labor [60 per hour] plus
 the kit.&quot;  He didn't think he could get one today, but I knew my mechanic
 ...........Mechanic Jr said &quot;no, I will
do it for you today, I promise.&quot;  .............he hands me a bill for ... 
EVERYONE PLEASE SIT DOWN !!!!   ALMOST $400 ... YES .. $400 ..
 $300 labor and $50 for the kit and tax ..  I said &quot;wait a damn minute.  My 
car
 was here less than 4 hours... it wouldn't be $300 in labor .. &quot; He tells me
 that is the price I was quoted and I tell him that is not true .. .......... 
So Mechanic
 Senior knocked $100 off the bill.  I wasn't happy but paid and then the old
 guy started SCREAMING AT ME .. saying &quot;how DARE YOU threaten to take the 
bus.......................
 
 END OF STORY .. Horrible horrible experience .. Never going back except to 
get
 my engine made RIGHT !!
