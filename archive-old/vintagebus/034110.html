In 1959&lt; Binz changed the way the door opens! I have only heard of 1 1959
Binz and that was from Mike Baily of Tucson. The gentalmen he bought his
1958 Binz from also has a 1959. (ps. Mike bought his Binz a few months ago
out of an LA. CAL newspaper ad.

&lt;&lt;I have noticed in some of the pictures of the Binz's that the rear door is

hinged on the front of some and the rear of others,all of these being LHD

vehicles.Was there any format to door placement?
