[...] what?
&gt; An informal, casual gathering of Bus minded people.
&gt; 
&gt; Where?
&gt; Tuckahoe State Park campgrounds, Marylands Eastern
&gt; Shore.
&gt; 
&gt; When?
&gt; 23-25 Aug 02
&gt; 
&gt; What can i expect?
&gt; Level padded sites, water and trash on site, bathhouse
&gt; with hot showers and an additional hot water tap
&gt; ouside. Wooded, quiet campground :) rental cabins
&gt; available. Dumping station.
&gt; 
&gt; Wildlife !!!! Bald Eagles !!! Whitetailed deer,
&gt; beavers, muskrats, groundhogs, squirrels chipmunks,
&gt; rabbits birds and more birds, and more furry little
&gt; woodland creatures !! bring a camera :)
&gt; 
&gt; Activities - 
&gt; canoeing: excellent canoe trails on upper and lower
&gt; rivers, and on the marsh/lake itself. Canoe rentals
&gt; thru park service available, and launch sites for your
&gt; canoe.
&gt; Trails - hiking, biking and horse trails run thru the
&gt; entire park area.
&gt; for the kids - many playgrounds
&gt;  
&gt; Adkins Arboretum - a 500 acre site in the park,
&gt; displays and propagates trees, shrubs and plants
&gt; native to Maryland.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be reserving a few sites next to each other. If
&gt; more turn up, then i will ask for donations to help
&gt; with the expense, but we can fit three per site :)
&gt; 
&gt; DIRECTIONS : 
&gt; from Annapolis Maryland - take rt 50 east, across the
&gt; Bay Bridge ($2.50 toll one way pay) to rt 404 east.
&gt; Cross the Tuckahoe river, and at the top of the hill,
&gt; turn left at the light (rt 480), make your first left
&gt; (Eveland rd) to the T (its a couple miles), turn
&gt; right, then an immediate left on Cherry Lane.
&gt; campground is about a mile on the left, go straight
&gt; back to the camping loop .. we will  wear a volkswagen
&gt; bus so you know who we are :p
