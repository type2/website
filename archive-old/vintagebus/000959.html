I sent them a nice crisp ten dollar bill (at the time, it said 10 DM instead
of 20).  I'd send them cash since your check will take forever to clear and
they take quite a hit trying to cash a money order from the states.

My double cab is a 59, maybe the 59 microfiche is in better shape than for
65.

Good luck.
Dave

&gt;&gt;David Mayes,  You said to send Volkswagon Museum 13-20$ , should this be
money order cash or check?  The letter I got from Volkswagon in Germany
said &quot; extremely fragile microfiche, unreadable through overuse.&quot;  What
gives?   Jon 65 Sundial
