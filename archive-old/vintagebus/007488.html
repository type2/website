Hi David,
I think I may have used the incorrect terminology.  I'm think of a belt with
a lap part and an over the should part - similar to how new cars are
equipped.  The person doing the body work  will add a support plate for the
over the shoulder belt. Still with the over the shoulder part I wonder, as
you say, about getting into 3rd gear of just leaning over the steering wheel
comfortably to drive.

Thank you for the reply.

&gt; &gt; whether to use the standard lap belt or a 3-point harness.  I have read
&gt; &gt; messages in the achieve discussing the pros &amp; cons.  My local VW shop
here
&gt; &gt; sells EMPI 3-point retractable harness.  They claim that it is long
enough
&gt; &gt; for putting into a bus, but are not 100% sure.
&gt;
&gt; Are you talking about a full over-shoulder harness? (which would generally
&gt; mount to a rearward point._dot_usually a back seat bolt hole in a normal
&gt; car..)
&gt;
&gt; Or are you talking about a standard 3 point shoulder-strap seat belt?
&gt;
&gt; If you really are refering to harness i would HIGHLY not suggest it.  with
&gt; such an unsupportive lowback seat as a bus has, I can forsee serious back
&gt; injury in an accident..not to mention the potential illegality for street
&gt; use. (a harness doesnt allow you to move. In most cars you have to
&gt; unharness to change radio stations...in a bus you'd probably have to
&gt; unharness to hit 3rd gear!)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If a normal belt, I'd suggest checking the archives again. There has been
&gt; much talk about this.  The biggest concern is that the B pillar is not
&gt; designed to support the pull from a belt, and withouth proper
&gt; reinforcement the bolt woult pull our, or the entire pillar would bend in
&gt; a crash....leaving you with a useless shoulder belt.  And depending on the
&gt; belts design, possibly a useless lap-section as well.
&gt;
&gt; my few cents.
