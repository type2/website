Since I don't have a stock T2 running at the moment, I won't be at KP. Nah,
I'm not that strident, there's a GREAT beer festival in Booneville, CA
Saturday hosted by the Anderson Valley Brewing company. I'm hauling pulque
up for a local Fresno brewery, so I'll miss the fun. I predict the fun will
be the 4 hour wait to drive in because the gate will be arguing with every
driver about the definition of a show car. 
I'll be in the orange/yellow DC on 580 and 5 Sun. afternoon. 
Of course the Red Barn is to KP what OCTO is to the Classic, right? Sorry to
miss that.
