Plenty of possibilities. Looks pretty nice!

Like I said before, I can't wait for the Chicago show. I'll be the first one
drooling all over this thing. Once again, just to point out, I'd trade all
my non ACVW's for it but not my Bus.

My bus is in hibernation right now waiting for spring. I won't drive it in
the snow. Some of you guys might think I'm a nut, especially the ones that
own nothing and would not buy anything else except for a Splittie. I hope we
can all understand each other well.

Later,

Andre

&gt; A double cab, and a single cab.
