     Speaking of calendars, Santa Claus brought me &quot;The 2002 Volkswagen 
Historical Calendar&quot;.  It's way cool, but I did notice a problem with it.  
Seems VW can't tell the difference between a split single cab and a bay 
single cab.  The month of January shows a very nice split single cab, but the 
caption says 1969.  You would think that they would proofread there stuff?  I 
guess not.....
