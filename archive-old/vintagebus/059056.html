Subject: RE: [VB] '65 bus 6V to 12V wiper motor conversion

The 6 to 12 volt modification of my '65 wiper motor was a success:)  I am
very happy to say that the single cab is now voltage drop free!!!  I don't
know why someone didn't cover this before since it is so easy and the only
downside is that you have to cannibalize the beetle motor to get the
necessary parts:(  Oh well too bad for the beetle people;)  As a side
benefit now that the motor is fed 12 volts even my intermittent wipe mod
works as designed.

Hi, Thomas....
Great! I would like to hear if it is a success, as I too have a '65
wiper
motor sitting on my bench and I am changing my bus to 12V.
Let me know if it works ...
Thanks in advance...
