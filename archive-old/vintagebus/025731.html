Seems to me that 98% of vehicular safety is due strictly to the operator of the vehicle.  Those built today are not designed to give the 'driving experience'  the advertisers try to push on consumers.  The cars of today are so very capable that 99% of the drivers simply cannot utilize the vehicle's complete capabilities.  Instead, they are made to insulate the occupants from the road.  The remaining 2% I attribute to environmental conditions (road or weather hazards).

There is no feedback, no feel through the steering wheel, power brakes don't even give you a feel for the effort the brakes are making.  Call it tactile feedback.  All you feel is the 'exhilarating rush of power' when you step on the gas, centripetal force when you corner.  You're in a cushy environment with your 6 speaker surround sound 6 cd player, air conditioning, and cruise control.  Oh yeah, don't forget the cell phone.  All these distractions.

I chose a bus as my daily driver because I enjoy 'tactile driving'.  In the Tinkertoy, I feel what the tires are doing.  I feel the bumps, changes in the road surface, and how much effort I put into braking.  I know when the right rear tire is down that 3 lbs of air it loses every 2 weeks.

I have to drive 'tactically' because of all the insulated drivers that don't have a clue what the road (or they) are doing.  They are so insulated from what they're doing that I almost have to drive FOR them.  I know the Tinkertoy is down the scale for acceleration, cornering, and braking.  For me, it's a worthwhile trade.

My other daily vehicle is an older BMW motorcycle.  I can look into most all 4 wheeled vehicles and am constantly amazed at what people do while they SHOULD be driving their vehicles.  Drinking, reading books, newspapers, masturbating, you name it.  No wonder the most common phrase heard at an accident scene is &quot;I never saw him&quot;.

Case in point, rainy overcast day.  School crossing.  Crossing guard holding sign perpendicular to my lane.  What would a reasonable person familiar with the driving laws do?  That's right, stop.  I did.  In my mirror I see an SUV with a female busily chatting on her cell phone zig out of the lane to my right because they were stopping too.  She's so busy talking she doesn't see me, the crossing guard, or the kids in the road.  She was doing all of 60 in a 40 zone.  Guess what she did?  That's right, lock them brakes up baby.
I watched her slide closer and closer.  It was real apparent she wasn't going to stop before her vehicle attempted to occupy the same space/time as mine.  I thank whatever deity that was watching over me that day.  The kids had almost passed and there was a gap. I put the bike in gear and crossed behind the kids through the intersection.  I moved just in time, the )*(&amp;^%( &amp;^%(^ in the SUV hit my left rear turn signal.  Broke it.  I felt kinda bad having to do what I did, but if I hadn't I would have been road pizza.  I was
fortunate that I chose the bike vice the Tinkertoy that day.  The bus wouldn't have had the space and I would have been pushed into the kiddies that were crossing the road.

Saw an appropriate bumper sticker:  &quot;Would it help you drive if I shoved that cell phone up you ass?&quot;

Thank you for allowing me to rant.
Dave
