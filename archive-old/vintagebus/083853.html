Subject: Busses and winter

Morning everyone,
   
  Quick question.  How does the busses fair in the winter?  (other than the interior heating issues :) ).  I'm in the process of purchasing a 66 bus.  It is for the love of the bus, but the bus will have to make a 50 km trip once or twice a week during the winter (it get's to -26 C here) in return.  Do the air cooled engines struggle more with starting up in the winter than the modern counterparts?  How much more so?  I know I can fix the heating problems, but need to have to car service year long for the family.  Thanks
   
  Jim.
