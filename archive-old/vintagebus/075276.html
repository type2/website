Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

JOHN! PUT DOWN THE GUN AND STEP AWAY FROM THE WELDER!
Flux core welding for body work is nothing short of a mess and not a new
type of welder/welding. Like the saying goes &quot;You get what you pay for&quot;.
Flux core wire leaves just that &quot;flux&quot; in and on the welds. Just more work
to make sure it is cleaned out after welding. For a beginner and for body
work a gas mig is the way to go. I have a Lincoln 170 mig and love it. If
you are in the market for a mig unit buy a name brand (i.e. Miller, Lincoln,
etc.). As for cost you pay more but get a far superior machine than some
cheapo brand X machine. Also if you are going to buy a mig I always
reccomend buying one that is bigger than what you need. Due to the fact they
have more finer adjustments and once you learn how to weld with it , you
will find more and more projects to weld and wish you had went for the
bigger machine. Also go with a 220 volt unit and a good 220 supply (I put in
a new 6ga. supply line to my garage just for my welders). The 110 volt units
are ok with a good power source but most 110 feeds are too small of wire to
supply a mig welder with the power (line voltage fluxuations) it needs to
produce a nice weld. My Lincoln 170 is good up to about 1/4&quot;+ depending and
anything over that I have a Lincoln 250 ac/dc arc welder. The 250 is a
pretty old one but they are very hard to kill. I also have a Lincoln 225 ac
arc welder but since it is ac only it is up for sale (I got it in a package
tool deal).
