having bad laws passed that effect our hobby and lifestyles don't wait till
fridays.  i get scared when people try to pass their lame ideals on me,
especially when it comes to cars.  i am coherent, and i know it's not
friday.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; A couple points:
&gt; 
&gt; a) it's not Friday yet (not even in Australia)
&gt; 
&gt; b) similar programs *already* exist, but with the credits instead going
to other industries?
&gt; 
&gt; c) there's nothing that indicates they'll come and spirit your 1970 westy
away in the middle of
&gt; the night; this is a voluntary program on the part of the people giving
up the cars.  Now the
&gt; auto recyclers have another potential customer for some of the early iron
they're already
&gt; processing.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the actual text of the bill:
