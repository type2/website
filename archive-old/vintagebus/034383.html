Don't forget that the cargo door side also has an 'inner 
rocker strengthener'.  A sorta Z shaped bit that sits
between the outer rocker (sill) and the inner rocker 
panel.  It 'strengthens' the sill in terms of loading
stuff across it AND keeps the doorway (for cargo doors)
properly spaced or aligned (or however you want to
describe it.....8-))

&gt;         &gt;On your sheet metal question, there are three parts to make
&gt; up the
	&gt;area that you need.  First, and obviously, the &quot;outer rocker
panel&quot; (app.
	&gt;$40).  It has square holes in the middle of it with tangs that
stick up and
	&gt;go thru the second part, the &quot;outer ten inches of the cargo
floor&quot; (app.
	&gt;$45).  The floor will have the &quot;check plate&quot; that you are
looking for
	&gt;prewelded on it.  Usually, when you replace the &quot;outer rocker&quot;,
it is
	&gt;necessary to replace the &quot;inner rocker&quot; (app. $15).  This piece
is simply &gt;a
	&gt;long, skinny piece of channel-iron-shaped sheet metal that tees
into your
	&gt;frame cross supports.
