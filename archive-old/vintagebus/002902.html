Bob Hoover's writings are Bob Hoover's property. Bob doesn't want them
zipped and distributed in this way. Therefore, don't do it! Why does
anyone need to explain? I hate it that every three weeks we need to
again explain copywrite law to the newbies.
I for one am grateful for having the information available as Bob has
allowed, and it pisses me off that anyone needs to screw with it. Leave
it lie! If you keep mucking around with it, we will lose what is now
available. 

Geez! No need for the &quot;newbie&quot; flame! Excuse me for my free speech opinion!
Yes, I DID check out the VWWO site AND bookstore and thought it would be
nice to buy a book I would have bought elsewhere to help you guys out and
I'm NOT EVEN CLOSE TO OREGON!!! Now I'm not only sorry I dared to share my
opinion as a newbie, but I'm also sorry I helped out the club of someone so
quick to lash out at me for not knowing EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING!!!
