Hi P&amp;C,
Hmm, in our 60 panel camper conversion with the rear bottom of the 68-71 bus 
tank dented it goes in/out without pushing and pulling.  When removing it, a 
slight pull to the left with tilt to the rear allows the hump in the rear top 
of the tank to dip below that horzontial support that stiffens the sheet 
metal of the top of the engine compartment.  Thus leaving more of the paint 
intact and unscratched in the engine compartment!  Eric&amp;Barb
