Subject: Re: [VB] Observations of a Former Counterman (part 2)

More often than not, I see the counter guy disappear
into the warehouse and re-emerge with a box of Bugpack Cal-look window
rubber no matter what the customer really had in mind.




So that's why all these &quot;restored&quot; Beetles I see for sale have Cal-look
window rubber.
