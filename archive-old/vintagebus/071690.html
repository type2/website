Subject: Re: [VB] Air shocks on a bus?

I understand needing articulation (wheel travel), but most of my problem is
approach angle. Like I say, i've already dented my bumper overrider, and
raising the bus is really the only option if I want to keep going where i'm
going. It would be sweet to be able to rotate the center connecting point on
the torsion bars with a hydraulic ram to raise the bus up while keeping some
good suspension, but, that's not much of an option for me right now.  :-)

I 've heard of people T'ing the air shocks together so you still get
suspension movement (they all share the same air), but heard it makes the
car/truck/bus lean more in the turns. But, any turns I would take at any
speed would be paved roads, at which point the shocks would be aired down
and I would be back to normal.

Hey Raymond, you say the shocks that you have are short? Probably wouldn't
work for what I'm thinking then, huh?

Maybe i'll just have to bite the bullet, and slap some on to see if they fit
my needs. Probably buy a pair, and try them out on the front then the rear
to see how they handle and how much they lift with what air pressures. Then
if they don't do what I was hoping for, I can sell them on E-barf and try to
make back half of my money.

Any other experiences with them, i'm still all ears though.
