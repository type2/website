Saw this in the vw newsgroup. Since people are always asking about
AC's I thought I'd post it. Please contact this guy as I know
absolutely nothing about it.

Awhile ago, I purchased an A/C setup for a VW, thinking I may salvage it for
some parts for my own custom setup.  Well, I never did :-)  However, it is
collecting dust and it's open to anyone who wants to buy it.

First, I should explain this is NOT your typical A/C setup.  It's main unit
is designed to go behind the rear seat of a bug, with ducting that blows the
cooled air out from the rear tray over the headliner, and you use the
sunvisors to direct the flow.  The main unit includes:
- all wiring
- ducting pieces
- condensor, condensor fan, etc. (I assume it requires a hole to be cut back
there for exiting air)
- evaporator, blower fans
- dryer, expansion valve, thermostat, and all other misc. devices except
compressor and control knobs
- all plumbing within these units - needs only plumbing to and from
compressor

In addition, it also has the control knob unit and the wiring for the
controls that is to be mounted under the dash and a mini-York compressor
that has never been used.  Currently, it is configured for R-12.

The kit has no instructions.  However, after playing with placement for
awhile, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.  You could use it behind the
rear seat of a bug as intended or perhaps in the rear passenger area of a
bus... (just brainstorming).

Although everything should be in excellent condition (looks good, never been
used, no cracked hoses, no bent pieces, etc.), I really can't make
guarantees.  If my sources were correct, this kit was originally sold by JC
Whitney some time ago.

The kit also comes free with constant nagging calls to me to help out with
designing various aspects of the system :-)

Anyone interested?  I'm in Southern California and I want next to nothing
for the kit.  I really only want $60 o.b.o. for the whole thing.  E-mail if
you're interested...

Thanks,
Shad
