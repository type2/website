Yeah, it exists...  But I have no idea where you'd find it.  I used to use a
kit that would do this when I worked for SpectralDynamics to make the little
&quot;rubber&quot; feet to go on the equipment.  Was little stuff though and it's
durometer hardness wasn't very high.  Might take a walk through a
McMaster-Carr catalog... Or do a search on aerospace products...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever heard of a kit that you could use
&gt; to make you own rubber parts?  I'm looking for something
&gt; that would let you make a mold of an existing
&gt; part and pour a new one? It would be great to be
&gt; able to make your own instead of paying $20
&gt; for a *used* Empi camber compensator axle pad.
&gt; Not that I mind looking through hundreds of boxes of
&gt; VW junk at a swap, but there are some things you just
&gt; *know* your not going to find first.
&gt; Any chemists out there with an idea?
