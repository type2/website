 First off, I want all and Steven to know that I will be blunt on this one,
as I am on most things. When did you ever go to a VW show where drinking was
not present??? posted or not. When was the last time you went to a VW show
and had a BMW parked right in front of the sound booth where the raffle
tickets were announced? Both infractions of the rules at your VW show? or
not? The show has outgrown the field as of this year. Where will you put all
the VW's next year? need a bigger area anyway. Why do we get 3 million
dollars in insurance  ??? To cover all the STUFF that happens, thats what
for. I was walking around most of the day and saw people drinking out of
beer cans all over the place. At least I poured mine into a diet pepsi can
to walk around in and took my empties out in the cooler. I'm as guilty as
all, but covered my butt well I thought. Steven,  ask all your club members
about seeing drinking going on, with all of them walking around all day they
had to see something and should have announced something or asked the guilty
to leave the show. As for next year announce a non drinking show and check
all ice chests before anyone enters, hopefully this will be OK with the
school. Be sure to announce this new policy way ahead of time so all will
know. Put on all fliers, emails, ads to cover yourselves. I think if you do
this you will have more than enough room on the field next year, maybe even
enough room to have a BMW class also. Loved your BMW, but not at a VW show.
Is NA beer OK? only 1/2% booze, but still booze. Seems to me there is alot
of areas around you to have a show. Look for a place where beer is OK and
you won't have to worry about the drinking. A big open field in Prescott
Valley?, at the campground where we stayed off Hwy 89. Links Lake?. In
closing I would have to say VW's and beer go together and always will.
Steven, I think you are a great guy and the one who makes the show happen,
think about what I and others will say. Hopefully they will be as forward as
I  was. John Howard
