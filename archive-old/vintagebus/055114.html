Please do - I have an ad-hoc list courtesy of the workshop manauls but a =
definative one would be better!

This
book has every tool listed for VW's with pics of them all.

       I suprized to hear no mention of the other wonderful spring =
plate=20
tools. (brb head'n for the shop).  Bummer mine is numberless, does have =
a=20
bunch of German writing on it.  I've scored the factory fluid level=20
protractor a few years back.  It makes setting up spring plates a breeze,
oh,=20
great for checking camber too.   As for the spring plate jack, I made my
own.=20
 All I can do is laugh when I remember my first spring plate job, floor
jack,=20
chain, level, protractor with string and a rock....you get the idea.
                                                                  Peace,
