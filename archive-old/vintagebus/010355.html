Hey yeah, I kind of like it too.  Just as with the new beetle I wouldn't
want to own one but seeing one of these going down the road would be cool.
I can see an aftermarket add-on in the making.  A strip that fastens down
the middle of the windshield to simulate the split window design.  It's
gonna be hard figuring how to make safari windows out of that big slab of
glass though. :-)
