I can't do anything about the price of gas but if we all get together we 
might! No really the only way to drive the prices down would be to block off 
the fuel racks. You know the ones with the big tanks that look very dangerous 
right in the hart of the city. Block these off and in one day all the 
stations that are within 100 miles will be out of gas! Instant slap in the 
face! We may be one of the richest countries in the world but we don't need 
to pay a lot for that petro.
