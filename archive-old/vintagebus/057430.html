&gt; &gt; Bus content... Went to a beer festival in Anderson
&gt; Valley, CA. A sub-hatch Westy, double door panel
&gt; from a cider company.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran into these guys in Healdsburg Friday
&gt; afternoon. I told them about the Vallejo show, but
&gt; they told me they were on there way to a beer fest.
&gt; The white Westy owner was who I talked with. The
&gt; logo on the Blue DD led me to believe they were from
&gt; the Sacramento area........
&gt; 
&gt; When I drove away he said, &quot;maybe we'll see you at
&gt; BUS-O-Rama&quot;. I've never heard that, but I liked
&gt; it................
