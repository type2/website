Subject: Heater blower questions / ideas

Ok,

At the Phew-al-up swap Sunday, I picked up two late loaf air blowers.  Now
I'm trying to figure out where to mount one.  (I purchased two just to get a
spare, price was right $15 for one, $10 for the other -- both had relays
attached).

Anyway:  having thought about it, I came up with some questions:

Reference:  Stock air flow takes air out of the doghouse and pumps it
through the two holes on left and right.  Then you use your tubes to put it
into the heat exchangers and go up to the front.  The faster the engine
spins, the faster the fan blows, so at idle there really isn't much air
coming out of vents.

Ok, my idea:

  1)  Am I correct to assume that the air coming out of the doghouse is not
warm, it is just outside air and really hadn't had a chance to warm up UNTIL
it hits the heat exchangers?  In other words, the doghouse cooling air isn't
yet warmed...?
  2)  If #1 is correct, couldn't I just plug the two holes entirely, and use
the electric fan to generate all of the air flow?
  3)  Advantage of #3 is that a) I can turn on air only when I know the
exhaust is warm.  b)  The air is at a constant speed, as the electric fan
doesn't change with RPM.  c)  At idle I get better heat as the fan is still
running at full blow.
  4)  Any idea how much flow I get from one of these fans?  Is it equal to
the &quot;stock fan&quot; at 2000 RPM or more like the flow I would get at idle?
  5) If air flow isn't enough from one fan, run two -- one for each side?

Any assessment and info appreciated.
