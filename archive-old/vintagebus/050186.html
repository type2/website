Subject: Chicago area VW repair shop found

Hello all:

On a recent trip to Chicago to pick up an Ebay bus, I had to remove the
engine and change a head on a weekend (dropped valve seat).  I'm from
Minneapolis and had no idea where to go for parts on a Saturday afternoon,
but I was lucky enough to get hold of the number of Spencer's Home for
Battered Bugs in Addison.  Jeff Spencer sold me a brand new Brazilial DP
head for $125, and various gaskets, screws, spark plugs, PR tubes, and a
used doghouse exhaust duct for another $30.  Pretty fair prices these days.

Jeff has at least a dozen parts cars, and a mill and other machines for
grinding valves and flycutting heads, and a pretty good knowledge of air
cooled VWs.  His used parts prices are a bit high, and his labor rate is
$70 per hour (yow!), but in the frozen north, where can you find a good VW
mechanic anymore, especially on a saturday?

I would definitely recommend Jeff for those who are passing through
Chicago, or who live in the area and haven't found a reliable shop.  Here's
the contact info:

Spencer's Home for Battered Bugs
21 W 301 Lake St
Addison IL 30101
