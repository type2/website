gee, i don't know. you still have the bearings the stub axle goes through,
plus the 2 cv's on each side. that's still 4 bearings per side to me. you
still need to repack bearings and cv's, too, which is a goopy mess. and if
a boot is torn, you have to remove the axle and the cv just to do it.  that
can be a real pain, especially if the heads of the 12 bolts (6 per cv) get
boogered up or stripped. plus you need to check those bolts for tightness
somewhat regularly. i've seen them break, which requires the removal of the
axle again. from what i've seen, too, the sharp angles a type 1 cv is
subjected to if keeping the bus at stock height is quite severe and that
can't be good for longevity of the joint. also i've seen (type 1 joint,
don't know which axles) the axle actually popped out of the joint because
it wasn't long enough to make up for the angle and the extra length to make
up the space between the two cv joints when the suspension was
over-extended during severe use.  must've been a surprise to the driver! 
i don't mind stock, but if modifying the rear end, there are alot of things
to pay attention to and to me, more deviations, more modifications, more
parts means more chance for failure.
good luck, though.

&gt; Whats the maintenance on the CV joints Mike??  Look at them once in a 
&gt; while (at oil changes perhaps?) to see that the boots aren't torn.  Wow, 
&gt; that sounds hard.
