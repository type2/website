I've managed to get the oil dipstick adapter on and in the same old place
where it was before.  After looking things over, I came to the conclusion
that it is impossible to have the dipstick convertor in the beetle locale on
a T3 case.  It's physically impossible.  So I guess I'll live with the
dipstick cheating death by the belt.  :-(

I managed to get the rear pulley tin on and the Berg pulley.  I've got the
fuel pump, oil cooler, and alt stand all in place as well as the oil sump.
Stock rocker shafts were buffed on the wire wheel and all the stock rockers,
washers, clips, etc. are soaking in the carb cleaner can tonight.  I also
found a GREAT use for my bushing puller.  It works absolutely great to pull
the ends of the stock pushrod tubes back out without damaging them or
tweaking the out of round.  I buffed every single one and managed to take
them from scrunched status to upwards of 1 1/4&quot; longer so that I can reuse
them.  They look nice and shiny now!!  They also and say Made in W. Germany
on them which I find interesting.

The evening was rather boorish but I got some important stuff done that
needed to be done so it's still considered progress.

All for now...
