&gt;ps. Does anybody have a copy of the DEALER INSTRUCTIONS for installing
&gt;safaris. Just want to know where they drilled the holes in the winshield
&gt;post brackets.


Ronnie,
I'm assuming that you meant where the holes were drilled in the windshield 
posts for the brackets.

Since you are talking about OG here, and I'm not sure whether you are 
talking about the brackets that are on the inside of the bus (vertical 
portions of the safari) or the bracket for the hinge.  The OG had a metal 
bracket that was pretapped and slid above the window frame.  Clearance 
holes were drilled in the frame for the hinge to screw to this bracket.

I extended a straight edge along the centerline where the brackets were 
mounted, were that line would extend out through the wall, I measured and 
scribed a line on the outside of the bus.  I think a 1/2&quot; hole was large 
enough to drill for the bracket to squeeze through.  I think I had to drill 
through 2 or 3 layers of metal and then had a straight shot at sliding the 
bracket in place.  The holes were predrilled to help with alignment of the 
bracket.  The hole was welded closed.

Scott
