Subject: RE: [VB] I've been screwed

Hi Ronnie,

Most (if not all) of those are 4mm machine screws.... of various lengths.
However, I believe early busses (pre 59) use a sheet metal screw for the
over head fresh air vent cover (i.e. my may 59 dc has machine screws and
RobDs westy (late 58) has the sheet metal screws).  The latch screws are
varied depending on what type of latch you have.  I searched for ever for
the 4x12mm dome head screws for the latch to body screws for my 59 dc pop
out latches.  Doesn't the parts book list them?

Ronnie pondered:
  What I am looking for are the sizes of the screws that hold the hindges on
the pop out frames, the latchs to the frames, the latchs to the body and the
fresh air vent cover. The rest I have covered.
