 I have always wanted a bus, and I am now thinking
 about buying one.  My reason for buying one is for a 9
 month trip around the states.  I recognize this list
 is biased, but would you recommend the bus to me?  How
 much would I be looking at spending for a bus that is
 in good enough condition to handle the trip?  I know
 little to nothing about buses except that I have
 always loved the way they look.  Where should I turn
 to learn more about buses?  Any input is greatly
 appreciated.  I would also appreciate any input on
 where I can purchase a nice bus, or at least give me
 an idea of where I am headed.  
 
 I really like the Westfalia from 63-67.  They may all
 look the same and spread out over longer dates, but I
 only know what I have seen on web sites.
 
 Thank you

well, Keith, I think the idea of driving around and camping in a splity westy 
sounds great.   But I would worry about someone new to buses doing such a 
thing.  That camper is 32+ years old, and my experience is they all have 
delayed maintenance, and a VW bus driver should be able to do minor repairs 
at least.   So my recommendation is read this list, you will find the same 
problems come up again and again- these are things that tend to go wrong with 
buses.   A lot of people babble on and on and on on this list, so this is a 
good thing, cause you can see what goes on.Find a local VW club, and join 
NEATO (there is a website) you would find the Transporter Tourist Directory 
useful.   Look at buses.   When you see someone getting out of a bus (bay 
windows too, particularly the kind with the oval tailllights, they havethe 
upright engine) go talk to them.  THis is okay, we do it all the time.   Go 
look at buses for sale.   Drive one, do you like the way the splitties drive? 
 some people don't.    Find someone locally who knows VWs and have them look 
w/ you.   Get an idea before you buy.  Buy the Idiots guide by John Muir and 
read it even if you don't have a VW yet.  When you get a bus drive around 
town for at least a few months to get to know the bus before heading out in 
the boonies.   Learn how to tune it up, and do a 60,000 mi service before 
going on a trip.   Where do you live, maybe there are some listmembers nearby 
that coiuld help you.   There is a 67 (I think ) bus in Oly FS that is 
supposed to be mechanically in great shape, is pretty straight, funky grey 
paint, not sure about rust, but no obvious gaping holes, interior not 
outfitted,  think the guy wants about $2500 for it, which if it does run 
great as claimed, seems fair to me if the body is decent
