Not sure if you'll get much support for that event on this list Andrew.  I
could be wrong though.  Most people that I run into are going to support the
NEATO sanctioned O.C.T.O. event that will take place the same day down at the
Pond in Anaheim CA.   This event is being promoted as the co-event to the VW
Classic that is put on by Rich Kimball of Periscope Ent.  The O.C.T.O. event is
Saturday the 12th and the VW Classic is the 13th.

This &quot;head to head&quot; scheduling was done for a reason I believe.  Many people
were fed up with things that happened and didn't happen with the &quot;non-profit&quot;
SOTO club.  Turn outs to both events will tell if the people have spoken.

See you at the O.C.T.O. and Classic!

&gt; Anyone making the trek from afar to check it out?
&gt; I was planning on driving my 67 down from BC but I think it needs a bit more
&gt; work and I need more than a week to get down to Cali!
