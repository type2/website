Subject: '54 Deal-Part 1

VanBondo recently purchased a 1954 VW bus. Here is Part 1 of the adventure.
I will break this report up into several smaller sized segments.


'54 Deal-Part 1: Fish Tacos and Promises in the Dark.

May 8, 1998 was just a typically busy Friday. I looked forward to crawling
home and reading the usually whacky world of VW email which is a relief from
the seriousness of  my &quot;real life.&quot; During that time there were discussions
regarding VW tents and the identification of a rare 1954 Banjo steering
wheel. My thoughts rolled over to Joe Clark's great website as the instant
source for general tent information. It was also the source of the banjo
info hunt. Joe had included a link to Klaus Jacobsen's Strictly Vintage
Volkswagen site. 
Once at Klaus' site I spied a VWs For Sale button and quickly stabbed at it.
What appeared just about bowled me over! The featured item was a 1954
Ambulance which had been converted into a camper. Oh Jeez, another camper.
JUST what I needed. But it looked so cool sitting in that picture, The price
had to be wrong. I guessed a mistake on the seller's part in the difficult
conversion of Dutch Kronners to U.S. Dollars. You know how those Europeans
are... ;-) The bus was yelling at me to get it out of that picture and into
my garage. I got that queasy feeling like when you eat bad Fish Tacos from
an unknown stand... I hated that feeling. The ailment caused me to grab
another beer and repeatedly send email to Klaus until I obtained his
telephone number. I dialed the planet Denmark and confirmed the asking price
and obtained the answer to a million and one questions. The fish tacos were
really starting to kick in. Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Now here this! Battle
Stations...
By that time my wife had arrived home in the '67RFH Westfalia. She looked so
happy to be finished with her work week.  It was a shame that she was about
to loose her natural high. The smile inside of the Westfalia soon changed to
a frown as it progressed toward me in the driveway. She had seen that look
before. It is an expensive look when it appears. My overly joyful demeanor
was a sign that all was not right at the Rusty Ranch. I quickly made all of
the promises of a young man attempting to secure his first sexual experience
after the Junior Prom dance. I would sell the Buick. I would stop snoring
and loose weight and become instantly wealthy through placing classified ads
like that twitching dude on the infomercial. I would take out the trash and
never EVER buy another VW *EVER* in my life if I could nab this cool Bad
Ho-Daddy of a bus from the planet Denmark. I would respect her in the
morning as well... At least I intended to keep one of the promises. That
Buick will be missed...
