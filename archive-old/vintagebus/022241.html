I'm a SysAdmin for a startup telecommunications co. headquartered in
Nashville. We provide xDSL services in the southeast. My primary job is to
admin Unix boxes, with a few NT boxes thrown in for the sole purpose of
making my life more difficult. :)

We're still a small company, so recently I've been spending more time doing
customer installations and working on our core network than actually doing
what I was hired for, but I don't mind too much. Unfortunately I haven't
had too much time to spend on my buses lately, but that's starting to
change somewhat.
