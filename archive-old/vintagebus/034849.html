Subject: bad tranny  :(
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

my 65 westy started popping out of 2nd gear once in a while in October, felt like it didn't go all the way into gear, if i held the shifter and made sure it was all the way into 2nd I could let go and it wouldn't pop out.

that was about 2000 miles ago, now shifting into 2nd is funky, kinda pops/clicks, a sort of noise which is not smooth and worried me about what it is doing to the metal in there, could I break something.  1st gear shifting is also starting to get a bit odd.   If I wiggle it a certain way it is better, though with only 10K on this tranny, it should not be like that.

Double checked my shift linkage to make sure that is all fine, which it is.   I believe it is internal to the tranny.   I now have a bit over 10,000 miles on this 3.88 r&amp;p Todd Hill tranny (sigh) and will probably shortly swap it out, though I don't really want to deal, I don't like the way it shifts at all, and think it will only get worse.  On the other hand, I have done 2 splitty tranny swaps including rebuilding RGBoxes in the past month, so at least I am in practice.

Rancho thinks it could be an incorrect 1st/2nd slider.
