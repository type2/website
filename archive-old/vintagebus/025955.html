Subject: Freeway flier for sale soon. (kinda long)
Message-ID: &lt;38092FB6.60BA3A51_at_gateway_dot_net&gt;

As some of you know, I am getting ready to sell my Freeway Flier.

Just to address some of the questions that i have gotten in the last few
hours, i thought, hey, i'll just let everybody know more info on the
tranny.

It is a Transform tranny and has about two years of driving on it.  that
comes to the neighborhood of 30,000 miles on it.  It shifts fine, doesnt
pop out of gear, and is not a whining tranny.

now for the big question ive been getting a lot of.

&quot;Why are you selling it?&quot;


in stop and go traffic, they are less enjoyable to drive (compared to
stock), and why do i need to go over 65-70?  i drive 28 miles round trip
to work, and it is all on regular roads.  no freeway for me.  i need the
drivability of a stocker.

i would recommend this tranny to someone with a 2.0 for best results,
but you can put whatever you want on it.

i'll post to the group when i get my trans pulled out and ready to go,
it might be two weeks, it may be more.  it all depends on how soon i can
get a few days off work to do this chore.  

i would rather not ship it, unless i have to.  i am in Las Vegas, NV, so
someone from southern CA or AZ might find it easiest to buy it.  my
asking price is $200.

ive had a few offers, but i wont commit to anything until i actually
have it pulled out and ready to go, just incase for whatever reason.

anymore tips and tricks on swaping axles on these two trannies is still
appreciated!
