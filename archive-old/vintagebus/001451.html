Well everyone, I want to thank you all for the generous offers of help and
encouragement towards my current project.  I wanted to rebuild the engine
fairly quickly while it was all still fresh in my mind from the disassembly,
unfortunately, I've forgotten most everything now and will have to read the
damn book and watch the video and go thru the slow process of it all.  I can
do it quick and do it right if I get the time from disassembly to reassembly
cut down.  Anyway, to those who offered the free assistance and Ronnie who
offered the parts for nothing until I can pay for them - thank you deeply,
however, I have a this thing where it is very very hard to accept charity or
generous offers when I'm down and out (when I need it most) - it must be a
pride thing.  I even get mad if it's forced upon me so I must politely
decline.  Thanks anyway...

I did call Barrett's today and they are sending me new guides and valves but
I still have to pay to have the seats reground and the guides pressed in.
More money - money that I shouldn't have to spend at all.

I've currently unsubbed from the vintagvw list and wouldn't have even posted
this had I been able to figure out how to unsub from the type2 list last
night.  It's tough as hell.  In the worst way I wanted to get the bus
running by spring break of 2000 so take some college buddies out for a ride.
Then I planned for about a month to get Peter Davy's engine in my brother's
bug and then that would free the rest of the year to build my ultralight.  I
have no problem budgeting time like this and holding to it but when the
places I order parts from give me the shaft and waste my time, I get so damn
discouraged to the point where I don't have any fun doing it anymore.

So there's the latest update.  If anyone wants to cross post to the vintagvw
list to let the gang know how it's going, that would be fine.  I'd also
appreciate it if someone could tell me how to unsub from the type2 list.  I
don't think I'm leaving forever from the lists but I just need a big long
break to see if I really want to continue doing this or just simply move on
to something else that I really would like to pursue - flying!!!
