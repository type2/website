I'd like to see any metal convect heat!  Convection is transporting heat
with a material that goes from one place to another, like air or water.
Solids don't convect!

I think what you are looking for is conductivity.  Alloys close to the VW
case material have conductivities of about 90W/m K  Aluminum is around
200W/m K, while steel is 40W/m K, so magnesium alloy is about half as good
as aluminum at conducting heat, gut twice as good as steel.

However, you must also consider the thickness of the metal.  You can make
steel parts much thinner than you can aluminum or magnesium parts, so you
gain conductivity there.
