FINALLY made it home so my baby daughter and I can
share a bottle... ;-) Yea, the weekend! 

I checked the thin aluminum adhesive backed OG
sticker/label on the rear horizontal bar of my 3/4
rack. It reads:

ZVW 153203
Rear of Carrier
Max Load Cap 220 Lbs
Vendor Code B-1

Text is centered in the available space with aluminum
base text against a medium blue field.

Note that it says15320&gt;3&lt; not &gt;4&lt;
To reiterate, mine is a 3/4 length rack.

It works well and looks great centered on the bus.
Most  folks assume that it's full length. Unfortunate
for you all it is not for sale.
