HI, If you follow that advice, I would like the little big nut rear axle 
parts.

 &gt; Hi I'm looking at my 1963 rear brakes 36 mm nuts, they look just like '64
 &gt; brakes with the 46 mm nut any other differences I can look for?
 
 Hi Loyd,
 If you have complete 1963 only rear brakes and suspension you should have 
 brake drums with &quot;D&quot; at the end of the part numbers cast inside the drums.  
 Our best advise if you have this 63 one ton suspension is replace it with 
 1964-67 suspension if you plan on daily driving it or long trips.  Then 
give, 
 trade, sell the 63 only parts to someone who has a bus with the proper 
 Mcodes.  If you decide to just keep the 63 onlpy suspension then you will 
 need to get at least enough spare parts to replace one side for roadside 
 emergencies.
