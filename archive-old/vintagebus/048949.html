Gary &amp; List:

I purchased the headliner set from Wolfsburg West, $85.00 as I recall.  Dave E. is correct, the color and texture is really close.  Be aware, the rear section, which is the largest section, will sag (as the originals did) within 4 weeks of installation.  I guess that makes it even better as no one will be able to tell if it is original or repop!
The sag is only really detectable from certain points inside the bus, primarily the rear seat.  Probably over time it will really stand out, especially when people bump their head against it when getting in and out of the rear area.

I'm not sure what the *easy* solution is.  I believe Craig Sauls solution (Rosie the Rocket Sled) is to use 1/8&quot; ABS plastic.  It's original, but it won't sag.
