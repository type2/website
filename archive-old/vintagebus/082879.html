Subject: '59 SC Truck...WW sheet metal panels

The cargo area rocker on my '59 Single Cab truck is basically 
non-existant. A couple years ago I got a replacement piece off a 
truck from someone on this list (can't remember who). I spent a few 
days cutting out the rusted metal and prepping the replacement part. 
I never could get it to fit just right. And the replacement pieces 
where gonna need some body work. So....

I bit the bullet and bought some repro replacement body panels. I 
passed on the Alan Scofield metal due to price. I gambled with the 
Wolfsburg West pieces even though I was told they don't fit great. 
Have to say I'm glad I did. The pieces I bought will work just fine 
for this truck.

I got the inner rocker for both sides. The under cargo area rocker on 
the passengers side. The solid rocker on the drivers side. And the 
little piece to go on the passenger side front wheel well rocker. Non 
are bent or dented. Test fitting shows they will all work out great. 
The Alan Scofield parts would have cost more than double the price. 
Can't see these particular parts for this truck being worth the cost 
difference.

I will still use some pieces off the original truck part I got from 
the list member...so that's good.

Still might need to replace the front lower dogleg parts. Will donors 
from any year split window bus work? I see Alan S. makes these. Does 
anyone else sell them? Or does anyone have a junk bus with these in 
good shape? I need the drivers side. Will check thesamba_dot_com.

Now I just need to secure some fairly affordable replacement corner 
sections...I need the WHOLE corner, vents and all. From bed to bottom 
of the corner.
