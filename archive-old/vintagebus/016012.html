I imagine that at some point in the future, when the novelty wears off,
and the attention - and money - turns to something else, a lot of those
buses will be liquidated to buy the car du jour.  That's when some of
them will wend their way back here and to Europe.

&gt; The funny thing is, when was the last time you saw a bus that was sold to 
&gt; Japan, ever again? Remember the 53 or 54 deluxe that was blue and white and 
&gt; it was in Hot VWs years ago, the title of the article was sayanora. And I 
&gt; don't remember ever hearing about a sweet bus that someone picked up in Japan 
&gt; at there last vintage meet.
