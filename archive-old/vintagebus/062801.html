Subject: RE: [VB] Clear Speedo needles.  What year did that end?

  From what I have seen the clear needle 80 mph speedo were in all late 60
buses when they went to the 8 fuse, screw terminal fuse block and with the
wedges in the high hindge doors, basically a 6 month thing from what I have
seen. Only 1 of my 5 1960 buses has the clear needle 80 mph speedo and it
just broke! bummer

Hey, I think I can actually answer one for a change!

The last three months of the 1960 model year had the
first 80mph speedo.  This switch occurred at the same
time as the switch from the bastard 40 horse to the
regular 40 horse.  (I believe these were clear needle
speedos still.)

1961 saw a new needle color, I believe at the front of
the model year.  Check out the middle issues of 1995
HVW's for the &quot;definative&quot; answer though.  (around
May/June of that year.)  They did a once a month
series on the bus from sometime in '94 through
sometime in '97.
