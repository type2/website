Since we're talking middle seats, I thought I would put this out:
I purchased a middle seat for my bus ('65 Kombi Walk-Thru) and it doesn't fit.
I thought it would fit because it's a 2/3 seat, but the rail closest to the
passenger
side doesn't line up with the doomafloggits in the floor.
The seat is from a bay window, has a plastic ashtray, no hold rail or rails on
top, 
and the armrest on the right is only supported from the back.
I paid 80$ for it, plus something ridiculous for the brackets and bolts from
BFY.
I've considered making the seat fit my bus by moving the right rail over
(cut&amp;weld), but I just hate tearing something up like that.
It seams like I'll never find the right seat for the bus, so I'm leaning
toward
customizing the one I have to fit my bus. 
Anybody know what I have and what I need?
Thanks
