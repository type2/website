Subject: Rear Seat - FREE
Message-ID: &lt;fe6c0edf.2485f7f7_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Non-VW friend found in his garage...

Rear seat (rear, not middle) from a Bay window free for the taking.  
Upholstery is even pretty good.  I think the base is interchangable with 
splitty and the back may work or may not.  Better than an orange crate in 
either case.  

Seat is located just east of Kansas City - YOU PICK UP.  First come, first 
serve, will not hold.

Email for details.
