 I received a certified letter today that said im a bad boy because I am 
 using the word BUG. It looks like they are saying they OWN that word. Anyone 
 had this problem? I wonder if they are going to go after Disney world for 
 making the movie....A BUGs Life ?
 
 Sounds to me like VWOA is getting a little silly. I'll bet they don't have a 
claim to the word &quot;bug&quot; either. I believe that I'd tell them - matter of 
factly -- to go screw themselves, I'm not changing -- sue me. Then we'll 
really know. Of course, that sounds pretty bold from a person who doesn't 
have &quot;bug&quot; in his company's name.

My company's name is Garies Volkswagens. Reckon they could get after me? I 
don't care. They can go screw themselves.
