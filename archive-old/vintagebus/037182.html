&lt;&lt; The downer is that these are set up for right hand drive vehicles so they

I think all &quot;euro&quot; lights do this.  It's not so much what side the driver 
sits on, but rather what side of the road you drive on.  The European 
(german) lights on my GTi have the fluted lense and throw a nice bit of light 
off to the right while driving.  Makes it great for those road signs that 
appear rather rapidly at times.
