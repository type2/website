Basically a true story. Details provided to make a decent post...

A few years ago by a friend who is now in Rhode Island was searching for a
cab divider for his panel bus. During this time he ran across some
&quot;WhoaDudes&quot; who mentioned that they had one before they ruined it.
Imagine a bunch of partied out High School kids returning from the local
inner tube river floating adventure &lt;Salt River, near Phoenix area&gt; riding
in the panel in the Arizona heat. Several of the folks were sweltering in
the back. Due to the heat and the lack of airflow to the rear area, the
future engineers removed the divider and strapped it to the top of the bus
with light weight twine. By the time that they reached fourth gear the thing
turned into a giant Frizbee and shattered along the Beeline Highway in a
million pieces. The brain surgeons kept on flying fearing that they'd
recieve a citation for DUI, possession of whatever else, stupidity and
excessive youth. Longhaired Jeff was pissed that they didn't even stop to
claim the vertical supports or rubber gasket. I had to comisserate with him
and laugh at the same time.
