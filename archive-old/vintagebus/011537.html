I just mailed off four boxes of the new issue of OBR to a club in
California, who will in turn mail them out to all members.  This issue
guest edited again by Dave Easterwood, giving Tom some help that no one
else ever cares to give.  It has fallen behind lately, and Tom needs help
in some way, (he's always asked for help), but perhaps someone can offer
up a suggestion for a new plan.  I suggest 6 editors, one per issue
annually, so that enough time and concentration can be applied to each to
make it bomber...   just a thought-

watch your mail
