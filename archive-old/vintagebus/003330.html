Been working on the 71 1600 engine rebuilding. It is to go into the SC and
now is the time to chose the clutch assy.
I understand that I must cut the bellhousing to fit the larger flywheel but
what clutch assy should I use? I currently have the early shift fork that
appears to be pressed together (will weld it before use) and uses the large
bushing in the bellhousing. I assume (foolish me) that any late clutch,
pressure plate and TO bearing will work, right? Any thing else that I need
to do?

Note: The SC is missing 3 of the M12 bolts securing the redux boxes to the
spring plates. Cannot find the proper ones locally. Does anyone have spares
in their hardware box?

TIA
