I predict, as an industry follower, that VW lovers will stay away from this
concept in droves.  And they also mention that it would be produced at the
Pueblo plant to keep costs down.. Yhea, great idea VW.. it really worked for
the New Beetle didn't it?

--------------------------------

   Seeing that the New Eurovan is stickered at $30,000+  VW probably thinks
that $27k is cheap enough. They say the New Beetle is an entry level vehicle
at roughly $18k. You can buy a GEO for less then $10k, now that's entry
level.
    I wonder if I could get on at VW at an entry level position. I'd bet
that the starting pay is pretty good :)
