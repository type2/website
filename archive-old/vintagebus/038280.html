&gt;  I guess you missed the once only issue of VW CLASSICS 
&gt; magazine, it came out
&gt; about a month ago and was dedicated to the air cooled VW and 
&gt; it's drivers. &gt;&gt; I am also tired of the way to many 
&gt; cheap trash ads
&gt; and 1 sided tech articals in VW Trends and Hot VW's, I could 
&gt; basically make
&gt; up some tech one sided bulls#hit, pay a 1 year ad rate and 
&gt; get it published

I second that in a big way. The articles do not stand up to scrutiny and the
authors sound as though they lack any real knowledge. More than once I've
finished reading an article and been left with that 'late night infomercial
about the latest diet product' taste in my mouth.

If you stripped the words 'awesome', 'mega', 'sano' and 'cool'from this
publication there wouldn't be much except pictures of cars and (not even)
naked girls left.

VW Classics was a very different proposition. The articles were informative
and read like there was a bit of research behind them. 

I hope they manage to make a comeback.

Later 

Michael
