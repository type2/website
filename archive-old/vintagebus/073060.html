&gt; them work, you mash em, they grab drums, bus stops.

I can't remember if this has been covered during all the dialog on the
list, but here it is anyway. The description hard is a bit hard (pun
intended) to interpret. If you mean:

hard as in lots of foot pressure to cause the bus to stop--
	this is normal w/ our busses. there is no vacuum assist like in
	newer cars to help you push the pedal. It's all you, baby! As long
	as a hard pedal push can cause a screeching halt, you probably ok

hard as doesn't want to stop the bus no matter how hard you push--
	this is a problem, old bus w/ good brakes will stop quick

hard as in it drags--
	this is also a prob, but I don't get the impression this is the
	case, usually just needs adjusting. 

either way, brakes are a good thing, um-kay.
