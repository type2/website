Subject: Re: [VB] RE: 6V battery questions

Why would they sell a smaller motor for a bug?   same motor, eh? so if it 
wont turn a 40hp round in a bus it won't in a bug.  

Clara (who tends to buy batteries at Sears, as whenever I have got them 
elsewhere they seem to die early)

Ah, you had the Group 19L one that they sell for Bugs.  The one I run
is a Group 2 and weighs about half again as much as yours.  Suggestion:
if you get it exchanged, trade it to somebody who has a Bug and keep
running the bigger battery in your Bus.
