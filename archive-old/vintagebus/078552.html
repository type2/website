Subject: Re: [T2] 71 engine into 65

Snoopy,

Take the hanger off, it will get in the way. BTW, you can take the 
hanger off without removing the exhaust.

A few random notes in no particular order.
-You will need to swap out the front tin because splits use the 
curved front tin.
-68 to 71 heater boxes are different from split bus which are like 
beetle boxes. They will fit but you will have to wire them open if 
you want heat.
-I &quot;think &quot; the tranny on the split will have no studs for engine 
mounting. Mounting is carried out by the D bolt through the starter 
two studs on the bottom of the engine case and the mean and nasty 
upper left engine bolt. I hate that thing. Best solution is a 3&quot; and 
6&quot; extension with ratchet and 17mm socket. If you have skinny arms 
you may be able to reach up there and do it with a gear wrench. A lot 
of people just leave that bolt off which I think is a bad idea. 
Anyway you may not run into the above issue at all.
-You may have to swap the clutch plate and or throw-out bearing 
depending on which style is on the 71 motor. It should be obvious 
when you compare the two clutches on the motors to see if they are 
the same.

Good luck
