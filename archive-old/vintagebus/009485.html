Hello Everyone

    I just wanted to let everyone know that there is another VW car show
here on the Central Coast (CA) if anyone is in the area and doesn't want to
drive a long distance. I am not affiliated with the group that is holding it
but I know there is many shows this weekend and I thought I would let
everyone know. Central Coast Chapter of Vintage Volkswagen of America Club
is holding it.  Http://www.tcsn_dot_net/4618/vw/id2.htm
