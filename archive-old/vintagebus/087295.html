&gt; Does anyone know if I have to jump the brown wires emerging from the
&gt; driver's buckle? I have no annoying buzzer when I don't fasten the
&gt; buckle, so a PO must have disabled it. But will the van start/run?

It shouldn't be a problem.  The relay that wouldn't let the starter run
if the belts aren't buckled was a 1970s thing - my '74 Bug has one and
I think they may have been installed for one or two years after that,
but I'm fairly sure Vanagons never had them.  You will probably have an
annoying light and buzzer but you can still start and run the car.

I don't remember what it was, but I saw a movie or TV show on TV that
was probably shot in the mid-70s, and one of the cars (some American
four-door) had the same relay.  The guy got in the driver's seat, shut
the door, and buckled up, but the engine wouldn't start.  He had to open
the back door and fiddle with the rear seatbelts to get the car to
start.  I seem to think the guy was a cop and getting the car started
was a prerequisite for chasing the bad guy, but I don't remember for
sure.
