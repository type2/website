 &lt;&lt; Here in Havasu it cost my wife $34.00 to transfer title and register her 
VW
  for 2 years, then you add in the $25.00 for prsonalized plates (OLDVLKS) and
  another $25.00 for Arizona abussed children plates, but it was worth the
  extra 50 bucko's, not as cool as JP though.
  
  ronnie  az (soon to have SWAP BUS plates on one bus, BUSPRTS on my other) &gt;&gt;
 
 Or you could go with some messages that you see in junkyards, PRTSBUS, 
 NT4PRTS, and INTOW
  Mike &gt;&gt;

That NT4PRTS is a good one.  I was swapping out of my 61 a couple years ago 
at Kelley Park, and people kept wanting to buy parts of my bus!!!  (ratty OG 
paint, rocker rot,  but had all that correct nice trinkets on it)

(such as interior panels, roof rack, deluxe trim/vent trim, safaris window, 
bumpers!!!!)

To register a car classic in WA state, you need YOM style plates and  also 
YOM TAGs.   (unless you buy the cheesy 'classic vehicle' plates)
I went and found a pair of 1950 plates  and the metal 53 tags, which is what 
a new car would have issued in 53 in WA state.   You have to have the car 
currently registered to buy classic reg, and it is not supposed to be a daily 
driver.  I haven't paid reg on this bus in years. I have heard of someone 
getting pulled over and being told their tags are 40 years out of date by a 
cop who did not know of this old plate law.

Now daily drivers are all supposed to have the newer reflective 'mountain' 
plates.  Which means if I had kept it as registered to the 63 plates it had 
when I got it, they would have made me buy new plates.  (in 63 all cars here 
were issued with 63 plates.)  They said the old white with green letter 
plates (issued through late 80s) weren't reflective enough.  and everyone 
will have to buy new plates every 7 years.  What a crock.
