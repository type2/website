&gt;&gt; &gt;  I have seen so many single cab conversions it makes me sick.
&gt;
&gt;You know, these were inexpensive commercial vehicles that were made to
&gt;be used, and modified so that they could be used. They were not
&gt;manufactured so that thirty years later a bunch of us pencil-necked vw
&gt;geeks could get all steamy at how straight the rockers and gates are.
