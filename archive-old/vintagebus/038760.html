Made it home ok this evening; the poppin' fresh tranny held together (with
help from a lil' bungee cord) and with the Albuquerque Clutch Job
notwithstanding the bus did great. Mucho thanks to JP and John for taking
time out of their day to help a pair of travelers. I had planned on changing
clutches in an abandoned parking lot, but JP offered his shop and a lift to
Foreign Aide for parts to boot.

I had adjusted my pressure plate arms out to soften up the too-stiff pedal
(within spec) a couple of years ago and it must have been too light for the
mountains and that last gradient out of Albuquerque put the final glaze on
the disc. We made it about fifty miles out, turned around and went back down
the hill to look for a parts shop and a mayday call to JP. My backing plates
came loose from the generator and needed some work, too.

Stopped in to pester Ronnie for a while and met VWHoward and Tommy as well.
Bought a Rancho 3.88 that Ronnie had sitting in the shop and I plan on
changing out the Bungee Cord Express as soon as possible.

Haven't worked the mileage out yet, but we probably hit 5000 miles more or
less.

More trip stuff to come and pics, too

PS: Take your bus on a road trip, if you haven't yet. I heartily endorse
this product and/or event.
