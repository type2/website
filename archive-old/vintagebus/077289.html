&gt; Greasy Airheads,

&gt; Over the past weekend I watched a really interesting program on the
&gt; History Channel.  It was a history of the Pacific Coast Highway...
&gt; My question is, has anyone done the whole road, from San Diego
&gt; to the Canadian border in a bus, a Splittie or a Bay?

Never did it in a bus, but when I graduated from college I decided to take
a long motorcycle trip and one part of the trip was to travel from LA to
Washington state on whatever road was closest to the water.  i was young
and dumb and one thing that a desert rat like me forgot was the it's
pretty chilly along the coast, even in summer.

The trip was great, but took a long time and had a few long detours due to
the &quot;closest to the water&quot; idea.

If I had to do it again, I would do it from north to south, since this
puts you on the water side most of the time.

George
