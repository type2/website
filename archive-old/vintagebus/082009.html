Subject: Re: [VB] BBB?????

Glad to see Chris George got a couple honorable mentions by
roamingwesty!

&quot;...And then there's my 
friend Chris George out of Vegas waiting for us.
...        [and furthermore]         ...
Chris George, being an authentic French chef, hauled out
like 10 pounds of clams and mussels, and started cooking
them with seasonings from scratch. ...&quot;

If you see him again, you tell him that the Chili cookin'
(er, I mean eatin') fool from TN say, &quot;Hey BUUUUU-dy!&quot;  and
that, by golly, I've lost his instantmailafucation address.
 (really draw out the Buuuuuuu-dy part)
