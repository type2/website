Subject: Intake manifold gaskets 

So I'm putting my engine back together and things look good.  But ... does the
metal ring kinda gasket got right inside of the head and then does the
manifold fit right inside of that hole and crush down that gasket?  The metal
rings that I got in the engine gasket kit is too big to fit inside of that
hole.  They are just a tiny bit too large.  Confused ... OK.  My 40 hp heads
are single port and I'm taking about the gasket that goes between the head and
the pipes that come from my carburetor to fasten on to the heads.
