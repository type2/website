Subject: RE: [VB] Warming up a cold engine....

While admitting that Lycoming and Lincoln engines have much closer tolerances
and higher compressions and require a little pampering before a heavy work
out, VW air cooled is not the same.

You will notice that when you pull your engine down, even after it has been
sitting a few weeks, that there is a fine wash of oil remaning in the
cylinders. Scouring a dry wall is a non issue with these engines unless you
assemble it dry, that's a different matter. Oil is pumped to all points of the
engine within one minute or so and the bypass valve ensures high pressure oil
to the bearings and rockers.

The way I learned it was to grow your engine from the head to the block to
ensure a tight seal and good compression. Ring break in was always remaining
up the motor to 2500 or so for a couple of minutes to break the glaze and seat
the rings. We did that with all of our Formula Vee engines and they ran
great.

IMHO:

Not so fast unless you want to rebuild your engine sooner than necessary!!
 The
engine gets maybe 30 seconds to a minute before I go above 1500 RPM.

When I worked on aircraft engines, we were always told not to exceed 1000
RPM until you had 125 degrees F. of cyl head temp plus oil temp had to start
increasing.
Seems like the risk of scouring dry cyl walls would be greater if you rev up
the engine. I think that extra idling uses extra gas and emits extra
polution but saves the engine.
