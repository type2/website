I had always been told that there was a bus only version of this grab
handle. The difference was that the bus one has rounded ends on the part
that connects to the dash (to fit on the curved dash). I was told that the
bug version has flat ends. Seemed to make sense to me. The one on Greg's
bus has the rounded ends...I've never looked at a bug long enough to notice.
