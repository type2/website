I've found quite a few passenger doors for my '65 single cab. The problem is the cost of shipping such a large/heavy item. Due to the shipping, I've passed on a few really good ones. I've found others where the current owner was not willing to ship. Sooo - are there any New England, Eastern New York, Northern New Jersey listees with a door they would like to part with. It would be my pleasure to help you liberate some of that valuable storage space.
