&lt;&lt; I put my windshield in with roofing cement... it was mainly asphalt, is
 this the same stuff? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Nope, you did good!  That is just another fancy way of saying roofing tar.  
Which you can get in fiber or non-fiber type.  As long as it is a petroleum 
asphalt product either will work.  We have been using #108 Henry  Asphalt 
roof coating and lap cement.  Non-fibered, Brush grade, Solvant based.
Kind of reminds me of the time I replaced a leaky water pump out of my 
parents Rabbit.  My Step-father wanted to know if I had figured out what had 
cause of the trouble.  I told him that the water pump shaft seal's integrity 
had been compromised.  When he looked confused I restated it simply as &quot;It 
leaked!&quot;.      Eric&amp;Barb
