&gt; We got in Saturday night at a pretty decent time, got into my spot then helped a buddy unload a car in the for sale area. We took a walk through the America section and found tons of cool lights, racks, bikes, coolers, etc. at decent prices (1/2 of what is seen in the VW section) picjed up a few items then off to bed.

This is the real ticket.  All the good stuff is usually scored the day/night before.  If you're serious or just greedy.  Spend the 20 and go early.  Really it only 8 bucks more to drive a car in and park it in the car coral.  Do take off anything of value if you're driving and parking vintage iron.  The lot is a haven for criminals!!!!!  I watched a guy discover at first light that his 1950 split window bug tail lights had got up and walked away during the night!

It looks like 1/2 of L.A. County's jail population was dropped off at the gate on Sunday morning.
