i think the difference is between busses that had the &quot;dormie&quot; top put on for
the euro market rather than the NA market.

the only real diff is when you are trying to fit a front &quot;dormie&quot; roofrack
(made for the euro market) on a bus that was destined for the NA market. i.e.
the roof sits too far fwd to fit the front roofrack on

i believe the crandalls (if they still sub to the list) ran into this
pronblem..

m.

Not sure why this is or why it matters but I have been told the Westy Dors
have the roof installed an inch or two forward of where the UK Dormobiles
had them installed.
