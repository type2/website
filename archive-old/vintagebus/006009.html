Subject: Re: [VB] The name game

In this &quot;naming&quot; trend for Buses.  I going to call the 66, when it's done,
Doghouse.  My wife does like VW Buses and tells me I;m going to be sleeping
in it if I'm not careful.  So the name Doghouse seems right.

&gt; '59 Deluxe = &quot;Jack&quot; named after the guy I bought it from
&gt; '61 Westy = &quot;SB&quot; (Stupid Bus)  Girlfriend named it when I brought it home.
It was the third bus at the time and she was a little bitter.

&gt; &gt; To Da'List   Hi bus people I was wondering if anyone
&gt; &gt; would care to share the story of how their bus got the
&gt; &gt; name it now has.
