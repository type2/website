&lt;&lt; I acquired a roof rack this weekend, and I'm trying to figure out what it 
is. &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
Looks like the same manufacture of roof rack that Steven Howell just got in a 
bug model.  Yours should have at least four hold downs that are both threaded 
and spring loaded for quick ease installation/removal.  The rack you show in 
the image is the 2/3 length bus model.  So the one you have is probably the 
1/3 length.  We have not been able to find this manufacture of rack 
advertised in any of our VW accessory literature so far.  They are the wimpy 
manufacture of racks for bus.  Though thier bug model rack is much more 
robust in comparison.  Probably due to it's smaller size the thinner tubing 
just works better on the smaller bug rack.  We would love to find out the 
manufactures name of these racks!
