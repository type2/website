Subject: Re: Restoring front beam and greasing it!

&gt;First I will start with the greasing part as thats easy - when I grease
&gt;should I first be wiping off the excess grease that is pushed out of the
&gt;seal or should I wipe it off after filling them up?

I usually wipe off the old grease with a rag or paper towel before I
start, mostly so I can better see the old grease coming out as I pump
the new grease in.  If I pump a lot of old grease back out I will
wipe it off again but if it's just a little I leave it.  The Bentley is
adamant about not getting any grease on the brake hoses or tires, and
wiping it off right away if you do.

In VW's &quot;Journeys under difficult conditions&quot; manual, for driving in
places with bad or no roads, VW says &quot;The collar of grease which forms
at the lubrication points should not be wiped off since it guards against
the ingress of dust and sand.&quot;

&gt;What is involved in restoring the beam, should I just sandblast it and 
&gt;get it painted or powdercoated?  Are there any bushes that I should
&gt;replace whilst it is off?

Eric&amp;Barb gave good advice.  I would add that the Bentley manual has
good procedures for completely tearing down and rebuilding the front
beam.  Since Monday, there are Bentley manuals for every Bus we talk
about on this list (1950-1967) so there really isn't any good reason
not to have one.
