Subject: [VB] alternator vs. generator
Message-ID: &lt;384BF688.1624998B_at_silcon_dot_com&gt;

In the past few weeks, many listees have advised me on the conversion of
my 66 to a doghouse.  Thanks, if I didn't get back to you personally,
and thanks again if I did.

Well, as some may recall, I found a 74 beetle at a wrecking yard in that
had an engine which appeared to be in excellent shape.  This was a score
for my oil cooler and doghouse conversion.  I even found thermal
vanes!!!

To the point&gt;&gt;&gt;  a mechanic friend of mine mentioned that I should have
also scavenged the 12V alternator.  _at_%#$!!!  Rookie me didn't realize
that my 12V (converted by the PO) was a generator, and not an
alternator.  I am told that the alternator will be better for
charging/running extra 12V batteries for camping accessories...

Question&gt;&gt;&gt;  Is the alternator THAT much better???  (i.e. should I go
back and grab the alternator and it's associated parts?)

Ugh,
Mark
