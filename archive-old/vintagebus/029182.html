Subject: Tuning dual Kadrons

Today I took a 2 hour lunch and tuned my Kadrons.

First, I had to find something that would fit the top of the carbs, to
connect the vacuum sync tool to. Turns out that those little plastic
axle nut covers that fit into a stock Beetle wheel are perfect. I had to
cut off the closed end, then tape it to the vac/sync tool...

Pinched off the vacuum line that connects the two carbs, disconnected
the linkage from the left carb. Adjusted the idle screws on the carbs
till the vacuum was the same on both. Adjusted the volume screws (or are
they air correction screws?) till I got the smoothest idle, then out
another quarter turn. Had to go back and forth between the idle screws
and volume screws until both carbs balanced and the engine ran smoothly.
Put the air cleaners back on, adjusted the linkage and took the clamp
off of the vacuum hose...

Does this sound right? She idles beautifully, accelerates well and
sounds good, but when I let off the gas, she &quot;pops&quot; some. If I goose the
throttle back at the engine compartment, where I can watch the exhaust,
I'm getting a little bit of black smoke. Timing is dead on. I'm guessing
she's running a little rich. Any quick suggestions from the Kadron gods?
