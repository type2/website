Hope its an opera and not pop goes the weasel...
actually I didn't pop put going back over the hill
maybe that trans fluid change did the job.(I Wish)

Actually, sense driving an air cooled vehicle makes me more &quot;in tune&quot; or
paranoid of engine temps and because the engine and trans are one assembly I
do think that transmission temperature is important as well. That's why this
GL-4, GL-5 thread has been so interesting. I'm going back and reread this
from that perspective. Have all of you ever noticed a difference in shifting
performance after the Vee Dub warms up? I'm a tropical person so I don't know
about radical temperature differences.
