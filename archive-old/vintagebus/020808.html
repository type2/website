&gt; I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.

&gt; They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, but
&gt; what pressures should I run?

ON a camper with 185R14 radials, the manual pressures are:

30PSI front, 37PSI rear at 3/4 load.
30PSI front, 40PSI rear at full load.

If you run more pressure, the ride will be be stiffer and you'll wear the
tires in the middle of the tread.

&gt; The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
&gt; adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are
&gt; balanced correctly. Anyway, as I drove off there was no roughness in the
&gt; ride. They seemed very smooth until I touched the brakes. When I touch the
&gt; brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a warped
&gt; drum. What the?
&gt; Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not make
&gt; any sense to me.

Retorque the lug nuts.  Uneven torque might warp the drums.  I never
let a tire shop near my lug nuts.  I take the wheels off myself and
take them the bare wheels.  That way, the tire jockey can't forget to
reset his air wrench from &quot;Peterbilt&quot; to &quot;Volkswagen&quot;.

Take the tires to some place that balance the wide-5 wheels properly.  As
the VW ad said &quot;Are you paying someone to learn how to fix your VW?
