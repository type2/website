Subject: Re: [VB] Repro semaphore lenses?
To: dworkin_at_village_dot_org, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

what kind are you wanting?   I know that the lenses for the grooved 
semaphores are reproed as I supplied the sample and got a pair.  I don't know 
about others, possibly they are.  Jeff Slater is very knowledable about 
semaphores.  There were several versions VW used.

 Is anyone making repro semaphore lenses?  If not, how many people
 would be interested in some, and how much would you pay?  I need a
 set, but if I'm going to have to go through the hassle and expense of
 getting molds made, it'd be nice to maybe get some of the investment
 back.  Finally, are there any differences between bug and bus
 semaphores?
 
 Tangentially related: has anybody come up with a good way of theft-
 protecting their semaphores (other than by not installing them)?  I
 suspect the answer is &quot;have someone repro the whole units for much
 less than stolen/used ones are currently selling for&quot;....
 
 Thanks. &gt;&gt;
