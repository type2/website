Subject: Re: [VB] AN INTERACTIVE VINTAGE BUS EMAIL!


&gt; 1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac?

6 or 7.  Mom bought a Bus (Bay window) new off the showroom floor.  Loved
it.

&gt; 2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if
there
&gt; not all the same)

1st car and 1st VW - '66 Bug, I was 15 at the time.  Didn't run when I
bought it or when I sold it but I made $125 on it.  I was hooked.  First
bus - '66 21 window which later became the Novus Garcia Bus.

&gt; 3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this
email
&gt; wiill be HUGE!)

One really but technically zero.  Drove my '58 Binz crew cab 3200 miles from
FL to CO to have the bodywork done.  They have the engine out of it now so
it won't run until the paint is done and the engine is back in.

For Binz resto progress check out:

&gt; 4. do you have a favorite? wich one?

By far my Binz.  Got to love that truck

&gt; 5. stock or custom?

I like them all.  Stock body and color with a freeway flier and bigger
engine are my personal preferences.


&gt; 6.would you punch an alien?

Not unless he/she/it hit me first.
