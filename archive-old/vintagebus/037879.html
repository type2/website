Subject: towing a '65
Date: Tue, 13 Oct 1998 12:45:49 -0400

I pulled my 62 single cab for approx. 100 miles using the towbar that I
bought from a fellow in Arizona a couple of months ago.  I found that the
single cab fish-tailed a lot, which is a scary situation to be in when you
are traveling at 60 miles per hour.  I tried putting some large hose clamps
on the torsion tubes to keep the bar from sliding, but it was still not
right.  I then put some inner-tube rubber around the torsion tubes to
tighten them up, and it was better, but it still did not feel very confident
when towing.  

Also, while towing a '56 panel van, I had the rear drivers-side wheel come
completely off while moving at 60 miles/hour.  The lug bolts had worked
their way out.    Don't underestimate the importance of torquing them down,
and check them every couple of hundred miles. 

Towing a bus is a serious undertaking, not to be taken lightly, or done
without preparation.
