&gt;Walter at The Bus Boys has given me a lot of insight into the steps
&gt;and procedures necessary to PROPERLY rebuild a steering box.

I'm pretty sure one of the VW rags had an article in the past few years
on how one of the shops (I think it was The Bus Boys) rebuilds steering
boxes.  I don't think they gave all the specs and tolerances but they
did show which parts get machined, which are replaced, etc.  It was
probably in Hot VWs since I usually read it more often, but I don't
remember what issue.
