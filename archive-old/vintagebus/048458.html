Subject: KS shop auction Sunday

I am drooling on my shirt. If you have a lot of space and are in or real
close to KC Missouri... well, the '67 camper sounds perfect, includes side
tent, he's asking $1200... I told him he could ask twice that and no one
would blink...

BUT he wants to sell it all as a piece, he said he has the state on his
back and it's costing him money, and he is **NOT** in a position to answer
a bunch of phone calls (like the one I just made) or to piecemeal it away...

I wish I was within driving distance of KC and had a heck of a big back
yard to hold all that stuff!!!
