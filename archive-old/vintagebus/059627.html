Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

The pics I took are of the 111 953 505 switch I took out of my 66 hardtop
deluxe, vin 246126769. As far as I know, it is original.

Funny thing is, this knob does not light up like my 67 does. But the parts
book says 111 953 241 is the swtich spindle with knob (6v) for switch 111 953
235 which makes it sound like it lights up.

In the 63-67 Bentley, E-1 page 13, shows the wiring diagram. J4 is the hazard
switch. It only shows 2 wires and the case is grounded. No bulb filament.
Page 17 is 67, J5 is the hazard switch. In the center of J5 is K8, emergency
light warning lamp.

I don't believe the parts book. I believe I have the correct switch.


&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; 211 953 235 Switch - Emergency light relay up to Chassi No. 215 190 000
&gt;
&gt; 111 953 235 Switch - Emergency light from Chassi No. 216 000 001 to 216 190
&gt; 000
&gt;
&gt; 111 953 235 A  Switch - Emergency light from Chassi No. 217 000 001
&gt; Which has 111 953 243 A spindle with knob (12 V) 8/66 - 043 grey black.
&gt; We have a couple of these.
&gt;
&gt; From dealing with a fellow a while back there seems to be a EURO flasher
&gt; system that has more then only two wires on the switch though!

&gt; The images from Karl look like 111 953 505 switch that we have a couple of
&gt; and can not figure when or what they were installed in.
