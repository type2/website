Steve,

stay away from Transform! Do a search on some recent threads concerning 
their whiney transmissions and lousy attitude featuring a post by B 
Hoover re his experience with them. I am getting ready to replace the 
whining Transform tranny in my 67 with a Carter's Gearboxes unit with the 
3.88 r and p. I wouldn't be doing it if their workmanship was as good as 
their old reputation was. 

Carter's is in Big Bear, CA.
