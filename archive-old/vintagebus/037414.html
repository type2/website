what do you use to brace the drums so they dont move while you screw the bolts

Hi Mark,
Are you saying that you took the front wheels and drums off as a unit and now
can not remove the lugbolts?  If so then best thing to do is to remount the
drum/wheel assemblies back on your bus.  Lower the bus back onto the ground,
block the rear wheels and engage the E-brake.  Then use a least a 1/2&quot; drive
rachet wrench or breaker bar and matching 17mm socket.  You might also have to
use a breaker bar to improve your torque.  Eric &amp; Barb

I was unclear on what he was trying to undo from what- but this interpretation
makes sense.  It is helpful in saying things like the front or back wheel.   I
always loosen lug nuts with the rim on the car, resting on the ground, then
jack it up to unscrew them.  Lug nuts (or bolts really) take a 19mm socket,
though, which is the same as a 3/4 &quot;.   I use a 3/4&quot; impact socket 1/2&quot; drive
on a long flex handle.   The long pipe (tall as me) is always close to hand if
needed.  Never broke a lug bolt yet :)
