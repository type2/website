&gt;&lt;&lt; Hi All,
&gt; After letting the 62 sit for a couple weeks,
&gt; I thought I'd better fire it up and take her around the
&gt; block a few times. It's got a fairly new battery (3 mos), but
&gt; it was deader than a doornail. I figured out that I had
&gt; left the radio on the last time I drove it, so It's been
&gt; suckin juice for about 2 weeks. Now it doesn't want to
&gt; take a charge (6v _at_ 6amp). Is this battery toast??
&gt; Can it be serviced?? Or should I take it back and play
&gt; dumb? BTW does everyone else's radio stay on when
&gt; the key is off? Never had a VW with a radio that worked
&gt; so I'm not sure if it is wired right.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;wierd- the battery should take a charge even if you left the radio on.
&gt;
&gt;I believe the original radios were wired so they could be turned on w/o
&gt;theignition on.
&gt;
&gt;I put my music in that way so I can play music while parked w/o leaving the
&gt;ignition on, but some people prefer to have it hooked up to the other fuse
so
&gt;only works while ignition on.   I guess you could hook it up so it only
works
&gt;with the headlights on if you want.


I guess I'll get used to turning it off when I park. I did with the
headlights.
I do like the idea of not
having to leave the keys in the ignition to use the radio. I think I'll to
keep it as is.
I gave the battery a good 15 hrs and it came up to half charge. I think I
was
just a little impatient. I wonder if it would charge even more if I hooked
it back
up for another 8 or 10 hrs. It *was* kind of sizzling (sp?) I don't want to
cook
the thing.
