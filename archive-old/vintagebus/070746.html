Subject: new (old) engine

My 1600 single port began making knocking sounds. I have no idea how many
miles are on it. It probably needs to be disassembled to find the source of
the knock. Meanwhile, I bought a used engine from a '71 Ghia. It's a 1600 cc
dual port, push-pull distributor, single carb, dog house set up, quiet pack
exhaust. The guy started it up on the ground for me. I sounded smooth. Who
knows how long it will last. I paid $450 for it. Before I put it into my 57
van, I want to at least clean it up. I pulled the fan off and found solid
baked-on grease between the jug cooling fins closest to the case. Signs of
overheating. Hopefully not damaged. I plan to do a compression test after I
put it in my van. Does anyone think I should pull the heads off first? What is
the downside? Any precautions other that the obvious? The push rods tubes look
like they could stand new seals. Maybe would be a good idea. What is your
opinion? Come on, I know everyone has an opinion. I appreciate reading your
advice. What do you think?

Dave
