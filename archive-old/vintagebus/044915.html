congrats!!!!!

I have so
many questions.  I don't know where to start on the bus.  The cab floor
in the front seat is almost gone.  I bought the two patch panels but
they leave a big gap in the middle.  Does anyone sell that panel, or do
I have to make it?  I have to replave the rocker under the 3rd door
also.  There are a few visiable hole around the windshield, what sould I
do about that?  I was thinking sand blast them and weld the holes shut,
and the grind them down.  The passenger side dogleg is in bad shape, how
much do they cost, and how hard is it to replace it.  the drivers side
is not great, but it is better than the passenger side.  How hard it it
to install the IRS transmission kit?  Are the lower spindles worth the
money?  If I install a IRS transmission, and 3.5&quot; lowered spindles what
kind of rim/tire combo am I going to need to get?

I would suggest starting by getting a running motor in it and doing the 
brakes, and making sure the electrics work.   This may sound boring, but it 
is a lot of fun to drive the old VW.   Then go about fixing the body, when 
you get it going, as long as it is solid enough that is.    And you get a 
kick out of the people going, wow, check out his stylee VW truck  :)    .  I 
find stock height nice,  don't recommend changing i, which and IRS kit would 
be a PITA, AFAIK.    Did you want the IRS for higher gearing?   The gearing  
to the engine is also affected by tire size-  bigger tires means more 
distance per RPM, and smaller diameter tires means higher rpms for the same 
speed.

  I have a number of
14&quot; bus rims, but they are in ruff shape.  could I go with empi 5
spokes?

you could use them if the bolt pattern is the same, I don't know exactly what 
the rims you mean look like or how wide they are.
