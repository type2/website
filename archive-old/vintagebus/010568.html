&lt;&lt;I was wondering how Thom sees behind his panel while he's driving ?

No rear window and the little round mirrors !!

Have you ever left the right lane ?

Is changing lanes conducted via the braille method ?

How many neighborhood kids have you backed over ? :-)

My 56 westy is the same way.........atleast i got side windows......but those 
curtains get in the way.
