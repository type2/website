Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt jump-starting

&gt;So the &quot;dead battery&quot; subject reminded me of a problem I've not yet
&gt;had, but fully expect to encounter some day: needing a jump on the 6
&gt;volt microbus.  Doing that from a 12 volt vehicle just won't work
&gt;(well, it'll probably start, but it'll also blow all the indicator
&gt;lights).  I have my doubts regarding random jump-start services.  Any
&gt;suggestions?
&gt;
Don't do it but if you *have to*:

It will work but you need 2 people:
Person #1 to crank the engine/turn the key.
Person #2 to hook up the cables.  Do not hook up the + cable to your 6v
battery, just touch it to the battery post when the time is right and for a
very short time to get the Bus started.

For me, jumping my 6v '55 always failed (due to other electrical problems)
and I ended up with a tow or push.  Jumping another 6v VW I had resulted in
a burned out generator but the PO had jumped it foolishly and incorrectly
many times so I blame him.  :)

And if you call AAA for a jump, be wary of any AAA driver that says &quot;I used
to have one of these, I know exactly what to do.&quot;
