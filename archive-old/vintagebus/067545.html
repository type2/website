Subject: Identifying Transmission

I'm trying to figure out which / what transmission I have in a 66
Splittie with a late bus engine (70/71) in it.
The case appears to be the same as the DK Vanagon series but the shifter
is a front center mount.
The number on the case is located on the drivers side of the case /
forward 0004-7342 (stamped into the case).
This bus has an independent rear suspension conversion with open drive
shafts.
Don't think it helps but the tranny is painted shiny black.
If anyone can help I'll search for other numbers and try to broaden the
description to the required markings / configuration.
