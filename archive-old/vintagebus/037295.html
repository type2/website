&gt; Clara, I salute you.
&gt; I am now on my 58th VW.
&gt; I NEVER drive on freeway.
&gt; Folks actually drive their VWs?

Yep Everyday. Sometimes for hours on end.
&gt; Maybe I live in the wrong place.

Dunno about that, seems like I may have driven down your way, although I
live in Oly WA.

&gt; VW won't do this:(
Mine Does.

&gt; Weekends, Tijuana, Bad roads, playing bumper cars. to change lanes
&gt; you must push car in lane you selected out of the way.
&gt; VW won't do this:(
&gt; Come back to Sandy Eggo, wait at border, up to 2 hours idling.
&gt; VW won't do this:(

Mine would actually cool down by sitting and idleing. And if you are going
to sit that long, just shut it off.

I am not sure what the problem is with vapor lock. Never heard of a VW
having that problem. Carbicing maybe? Not likely in your local.

About your fan shroud, I would replace the vanes. On a doghouse they direct
the air where it should go. I have tried my engine with and without, and it
ran cooler with them in place.

I can understand the worry of your bus getting stolen, dented, etc, but just
driving it? I have done freeway miles accross many many states, in 100
degrees and down to 0 degrees. My bus just doesnt mind. During 90 degree
weather at 65 my bus oil temp is about 220 or so. I have a doghouse, a 1600
single port, and a 30/31 carb. Thats it, no extra oil cooler, no sump,
nothing fancy. Oh yeah, except the &quot;freeway flier&quot; tranny.
Many, many people are driving their busses, and if yours was in good shape
you could too.
