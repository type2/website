Subject: RE: [VB] Rear sway bar/camber compensator

Hey Paul,

Sorry no pictures yet of the IRS swaybar install.  It is really straight 
forward though.

The bar connects with &quot;U&quot; anchors to the torsion bar housing and than 
connects to the arms with down rods attached to the lower shock bolts.  This 
is for IRS though so with swing axle I do not know what the product would 
work like.

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
