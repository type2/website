&gt; 1. Is the correct oil pressure for a 1500 the same as for the smaller 
&gt; engines (i've only got access to the '61 Without Guesswork)?

Hi Andres,
40 HP through 1600 were all the same pressurewise.

&gt; 2. Where do i want to be measuring my oil temp &amp; pressure?
&gt; 
We do it off the idiot light circuit with a brass X-fitting we machine from a 
T-fitting.  The best place for the oil temp is probably in one of the engine 
case plugs just downstream of the oil pump or perhaps we will sometime put the 
oil temp sender in the oil filter/pumps we use.
