You should go with an offset doghouse cooler.

You will need:

* cooler and adapter
* new cooler seals
* doghouse fan shroud, including the venting pieces in the back
* thicker fan (23mm, I think)
* doghouse rear tin, or modified normal tin, for cooler vent

while the dog house undeniaby has better cooling than the non dog uprights,
you can use a upright with less collection of items.   Just get an upright
cooler and new seals for it.   Clean it out first (solvent, compressed air)
There are ones with smaller and larger passages,  just like the cases, so try
for a larger one if you aren't going the doghouse route.

BTW, if you go with the doghouse (which is better) it is a good idea to make
sure the sealage is good.   I like a thin piece of foam around the cooler to
prevents the air from blowing around it- in the 'doghouse' part of the fan
housing.       There are rubber seals around the pieces of separate tin.  It
may sound like extra work, but it's worth it.
