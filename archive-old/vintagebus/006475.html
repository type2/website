1500 miles?  Hell, buy you a ticket to Lake Havasu and drive one of Ronnie's
buses to the event.  Ronnie is like that.  He tried to get me fly down to
Havasu last January for that event.  I know that if I wanted to head down
there, Ronnie would either drive me or let me drive one of his rides.  It's
more fun in your own VW but it beats renting a Saturn.
