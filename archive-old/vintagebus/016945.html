Subject: Oil leak &amp; High pressure

Maurice &amp; co:
I have the same oil cooler setup on the Tinkertoy (67 d-lux) and went 
through the oil leak blues as well.  I'm assuming you used the diverter 
plate where the oil coller goes on a stock engine.  Mine leaked like a sieve 
for a while and I pulled the engine 6 times to cure the leak (after buying 
another engine thinking I had a cracked case!)

Do not use the doughnut shaped oil cooler seals with the diverter plate.  
They don't work worth beans for this application.  Get ye down to the local 
VW acessories FLAPS and get the flat gasket that matches the plate.  Pull 
the engine, yank the tin (again).  Remove the diverter plate.  Clean it and 
then ensure the mating surface is flat.  Best way to do that (I found) is a 
large thick piece of glass and wet/dry sandpaper (medium then fine grit).  
Keep the paper wet on the glass (I really use a piece of botched tombstone 
{long story}) and run back and forth with moderate pressure until the mating 
surface is flat.  Right before you apply the gasket to case, coat it lightly 
with engine oil, bolt it tigether using correct torque specs.  No more leak.

As far as the high oil pressure when cold, they can do this.  80 is really 
high.  Check your oil pressure relief valve, make sure it isn't stuck with a 
chunk o'dookie.  Hopefully whoever built your engine didn't use pookie on 
the big-ass screw.

Good Luck
