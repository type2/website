&gt;
&gt;Also, can you run ambo fans on 12v? I've got my set of chrome ones I want
&gt;to install in a while 

If the fans are originally 12v, go for it.  If they are originally 6v,
you can use them with no voltage drop ONLY IF you discipline yourself
to never turn them on past the first click.  See, on low speed, the
two motors are wired in series, and on high, they are in parallel.
In a 6v Bus, a 6v fan set would have 3v across each motor in low
and 6v across each motor in high.  In a 12v bus, the same fan set
would have 6v across each motor in low (OK) and 12v across each
motor in high (no good).

Using a voltage drop is a good idea because sooner or later you or
someone else will forget.

&gt;(I'll prob be asking for wiring help later!)

Check out the wiring diagrams at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html .
The &quot;Euro&quot; Buses will have an ambulance fan hookup diagram on their
wiring diagrams.
