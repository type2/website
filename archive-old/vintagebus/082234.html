Subject: Re: [VB] apologies to karl!

I'm proud to say I'm Karl's VW buddy here in Fresno, land of BIG salvage 
yards and little rust. We get the castoffs from the SF bay area and 
maybe from the LA basin where they discard vehicles like last year's 
Grammy winners.

Even though my VW involvement has diminished lately, Karl is still 
pulling strong.  You think he knows VW's?   He's also on Mercedes Benz 
lists with his all encompassing knowledge (no bullshit in that or the 
next tired cliche!) and unfallible wisdom. Some feel his backhand if 
they're not paying attention and I know he doesn't mean them harm 
because I've asked the same stupid questions in front of him and he 
didn't clock me. Have you ever learned something without a memory spike? 
Imagine how he responds to  MB owners who have never adjusted valves or 
changed their own oil?

Karl's a pillar and a great guy. We'll make a library of his posts 
rivaling Bob Hoover's!

&gt; my abject apologies to king karl, who - for something like the 5th 
&gt; time - came across with a much-needed part... and much to my chagrin i 
&gt; forgot to write him and let him know it arrived :P
&gt;
&gt; in penance, i kicked some money to the List fund.   i think if 
&gt; EVERYONE that karl has helped out were to make a donation, we could 
&gt; buy google!
&gt;
&gt; thanks again, karl!
