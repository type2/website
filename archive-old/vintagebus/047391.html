&lt;&lt; Easiest way is to use 68-79 bay window wheel bearing nuts.
 I can get them in the wrecking yards here in Fresno, Calif if anyone wants a
 pair. Let me know. &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
The only problem with these is they will not fit pre-1964ish spindles!  Since 
we have converted to the later 64-67 suspensions in our 60 panel and 63 SC we 
have been using the later locking spindle nuts that use a allen wrench for 
locking loosening.  Eric&amp;Barb
