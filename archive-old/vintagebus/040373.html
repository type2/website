Subject: Front Door weatherstrip and door adjustments

Hi, I ordered a bunch of weatherstripping to finish off my bus (yeah
,roight!) and can't figure out the front door weatherstrip. 1965 splittie.
It looks like there should be weatherstrip on the bus all the way around the
front door. The door has rubber on it, but the body doesn't.
 Anyone know the how to adjust the cargo doors on a splittie? With
weatherstip in place, the two doors rub together at the top and bottom. I
need an extra 2mm for clearance, but am unsure of how to adjust doors. I
need to keep from scraping more door paint off.
 I really like the soundproofing and weatherizing that was done at
http://bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/ , so I will do that too as time and $
allow. I have used the Ice guard (construction roofing used as Dynamat$$$$)
for sound dampening before, and it works great...

Thanks,
Raymond McGill
