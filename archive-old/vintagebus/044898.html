 &gt; hey all, i have a couple questions...
 &gt; i have been driving my bus for almost 4 months since the snow stopped 
flying 
 &gt; and have a few questions. (1) im only getting about 17 mpg, whats the 
order 
 &gt; of things i should check to improve? carb? points? plugs? my mechanic says 
 &gt; thats ok, you guys all seem to get 30!!
 
 Asking someone about their gas mileage is a bit like asking them about
 their sex life.  The only person who is likely to tell the truth about
 either subject is a priest.  I'll pretend I'm a priest, but I'll only tell
 you about my mileage, not the other thing.
 
 I get a truthful 18-20MPG in my '71 bus running a fresh Mexican engine.  I
 got about the same with my tired original engine.  This is over typical
 Western terrain of flat deserts and mountain passes and cruising at
 57-60MPH (actual). &gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I get about 20mpg around town in my 65 westy, but 23 -29 mpg on the freeway, 
depending how fast I drive and how flat it is 26- 29 was flat driving ~50-55, 
but usually it is somewhat hilly on the freeway and I drive about 60, get 
more like 23-25.

But I did honestly used to get 31mpg in my first splitty, a early 59 with a 
splitcase tranny, a 1500 with low compression in #3, 28 pict carb, and 14&quot; 
rims.   freeway, round town, etc for over 3 years.  In retrospect, that was 
crazy good.

I write down the milage at fill up,. then again next time with the gallons 
put in, and can see how much gas is used (math for milage), rather than 
estimate by a guage.  Just do this in my record notebook I write down tuneups 
etc in.


To improve your gas milage would start with a good  thourough tune up, make 
sure your fuel pump isn't leaking, all lines good, check air in tires etc.
