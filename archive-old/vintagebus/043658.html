&gt;I know what to do electrically but does anyone have a suggestion for a
&gt;nice clean unobtrusive location?

I've never put one in, but in my Bus, the coil mounting holes tore out
of the fan shroud.  A PO fabricated an L bracket that bolts to the
roof of the engine compartment and has holes for the standard coil
clamp.  (They also made up a plate to cover the holes in the shroud
and put it on with sheet metal screws and RTV silicone).  The coil
ends up pointing straight down (left-to-right) and about 20 degrees
off vertical (front-to-back), just in back of where the stock location
is.  Maybe a similar mounting to the roof of the compartment could
work for the CDI box.
 
&gt;Also what have you done with the 12v which now needs to go to
&gt;tiger,pertronix+,cutoff,choke and brakelites. 

Er, back up lights, right?

&gt;Im thinking terminal block because splicing 5 wires just doesnt sound 
&gt;that appealing to me.

Far more than you ever wanted to know about hooking wires together...

You can &quot;daisy chain&quot; wires with those crimp connectors.  Just use
the next size bigger...most wires on a Bus take the blue-barrel
crimp connectors, but go up to the yellow-barrel ones and you can
usually get two wires in there.  Definitely twist the wires before
putting them in the connector and solder them too if you're into
it.  

Bus coil terminals are usually small studs; you can either use a
ring terminal directly or get one of those push-on adapters; the
male tab terminal with a hole in it to go over the stud.  I have
seen 2-way and 3-way ones fitted to coils; then you can get more
adapters that let you plug two push-ons onto one.  Stack enough
of these up at the coil, and you should be able to use this as
a &quot;distribution point&quot; for the other devices - just use a wire
with female push-ons at each end to hook up each device.

There's something I have done with larger cables, but there isn't
any reason why you couldn't do it with small ones: crimp a ring
terminal on the end of each wire you want to join and run a small
bolt through them all, with a nut on the other side.  This has
the advantage that if you want to hook up more wires, all you need
is a longer bolt.  You do need to insulate the bolt somehow after
you're done, however.  If you're junking, mid 80s and up Chevy
trucks tend to have something like this as an &quot;aux battery terminal&quot; -
basically a nice insulated gadget that bolts to the firewall and has
a stud or two (if two, they are connected together) on it.

A variation on this is a gadget Radio Shack sells as a battery
terminal adapter.  Basically it's a little plate with three male
tab terminals on one side, a big slot, and four little holes.  The
idea is that you slip the slot over your battery cable terminal's
clamp bolt and use the tab terminals as power points.  Or, you can run
bolts or screws through the holes and into the body and use it as a
ground cluster.  It may not be quite right for this application, but it
can be handy in other places - for example, I ran ground wires from
all my tail-lights to one of these, and I slip it under the bolt
that secures the battery ground strap to the body.

You can also get something called a &quot;closed end connector&quot; or &quot;bell
connector&quot;.  Basically it's a one-ended crimp connector with a plastic
sleeve over it.  You can get a big one, stick all 5 wires in it, and
crimp it down.  Note this is *not* a screw-on type wire nut!

For any crimped connection, give it a &quot;pull test&quot; after you make
it.  You shouldn't be able to pull it apart with your hands.

Finally, a terminal block.  :)  If you want to be really &quot;OG&quot;,
use a European-style terminal block - the white nylon kind with
the recessed screws.  Rat Shock sells these too.  On most of these
you can cut them in between the screws to the length you need,
if the one you have is too long.  The &quot;standard&quot; flat type,
exposed screw terminal block will also work just fine.

Here's something I recommend NOT using: those &quot;guillotine&quot; tap-in
connectors.  These are the ones with the plastic housing and the
metal blade with two slots.  The blade slides down over the two
wires and makes a &quot;connection&quot;, and then part of the housing folds
over the blade.  There isn't much contact area in one of these,
and they tend to get corroded and fall apart.  They are OK for
*temporary* lash-ups, testing, or emergencies, but not so great
for long-term use.  Again just MHO.

I hope this helps!
