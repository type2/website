Subject: Re: Restoration Question - Blasting

Thom--FWIW  I had my Fridolin media blasted first thing upon arriving in Phoenix before
any body work was done--Needless to say it looked like a large piece of Limburger cheese--
With several pieces missing--Thank goodness the Westfalia Factory in Germany was kind
enough to send us photos   so we could see what the Swiss version of a Fridolin looked
like.--Of course i knew i was in trouble when we drove the Fridolin off the docks in
California and a piece of the body fell off that was siliconed on. There are no Fridolin
wreaking yards in America--But i did find a Fridolin Club in Germany for parts. Ergo the
Fridolin was my 1st and last &quot;Ground-up&quot; restoration--I think i should have started off
with something that was easier.-But upon completion i sent a photo to the Wesfalia Museum
and received a reply that they were very pleased with the results--So it really was worth
the effort--
