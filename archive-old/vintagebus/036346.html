Thanks for the info. You could crash at my place but I am an hour east of Portland. That makes two hours total out of your way. I hung with the Berg guys last year and am probably part of the reason for the 70mph ruling. A small nut tranny doesn't like to go much over 60. I found myself at 65 a couple of times trying to keep up. I would much rather cruise with a group of bus people. What day do you expect to go through Portland?

Thanks,
