Hello Listees,

Haven't posted for awhile with an update on my bus, but things have been 
going well lately, so I figured I'd chime in.  I got in contact with a guy 
in my local VW club because I was looking for some 15 inch rims.   I've got 
two, and I just need a couple more.  Anyway, we got to talking busses, turns 
out he knows my bus.  He almost bought it before I swooped in and picked it 
up.  He didn't pick it up because he has enough projects already ('58 kombi, 
65 DC, 65 E-Z camper).  Anyway, he said he had some long seat cushions that 
came with his '58 that he had no idea what they went to. I figured out that 
they were two of the cushions that make up the side facing seat/bed for 
flipseat westy's.  I said I would be interested in getting them from him, so 
we worked out a trade for some sheet metal that I had around.

I went out to pick up the seats the other day, and in the back of his 
garage, I noticed a set of white formica covered cabinets.  Turns out that 
it is the passenger side clothes closet and cabinets, and the icebox from a 
SO-34 camper.  He had no use for them, so we worked out a deal, and I picked 
them up tonight!  I'm excited to finally be piecing together the interior of 
my bus.  These cabinets are not in the best condition, they will need work, 
but I am very happy that I found them.  The icebox door is missing a handle, 
though.  Does anyone out there have an extra one?  I've heard that any 
handle from SO-23, SO-34/35 and SO-33 will fit.  Also, if anyone has any 
cabinet hardware (hinges or latches) for this vintage for sale I'd be 
interested.  I will still need to fabricate a couple of cabinets.

Bodywork is still progressing slowly, someday I'll throw together a webpage 
and direct you all to see it.  Until then, everybody will just have to be 
satisfied with my infrequent postings ;-)

Thanks for the help everybody,

Mike A.
'64 SO-35 (with SO-34 cabinets, so maybe its an SO-34.5)
