Subject: Initial report on tires...

Okay, I went with the Bridgestone RD603V's 185R14. They have a tread
similar to my long-standing fave tire, the Michelin XZX, which has been
discontinued, and are 6 or 8 ply, with reinforced sidewall.

I just drove from south Florida to Long Island, NY, where I'll be staying
for a while. The driving was mostly dry, no real wet weather. The most
impressive things at first glance are that they are quiet! Maybe cause
they're new, but they are quiet! ;-) They feel really nice under the
stearing wheel too - easier to turn. They seemed to resist side thrust
from winds nicely too.

More reportage after I get to experience them more.
