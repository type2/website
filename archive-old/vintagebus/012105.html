&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Right, but do not forget to change your oil if more than 6 months
has passed
&gt; by even if you ran the oil in the running engine for only 5 minutes.
 After 6
&gt; month the oil changes into acid more and more.  Have two cases that
the oil
&gt; ate it's way through the bottom of the case.  Eric &amp; Barb

Don't worry, I put on more miles than that!  Good point, though!  

It seems that VW cases are a lot more prone to corrosive attack than
other engines.  Another reason for frequent oil changes, since no
filtering method removes the corrosive impurities in the oil.  The
only way to get rid of that stuff is to replace the oil with new.
