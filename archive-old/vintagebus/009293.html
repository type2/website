&gt; Well, the stars must have lined up wrong or something; I actually have
&gt; *3* dates this weekend.  At this rate, the '54 will never get done...
&gt; I wonder if I could get any of them to pose with the bus; the '60 DD
&gt; will be the date-mobile as the 911 is funked up with a fuel injection
issue.
&gt; It pays to have at least one presentable VW!

Hey way cool there Slick.  You have to get a photo of at least one of your
dates up on vintagebus_dot_com so we can see what kind of taste you have in
women. I really wanna see if the look on her face is one of bliss or
outright disgust as in (wtf am I doing here with this computer geek taking a
photo of me and this god-forsaken hippy van.)

&gt; If you're at NQ's house working on the bus, and you drop a wrench, be
&gt; sure to kick it over to the wall before you go to pick it up...

BWAHAWHAWHAWHAW!!!  I about fell out of my chair laughing on this one.
Seems like Thom always has a good comeback or wise crack.  I'm looking
forward to meeting you Thom.! :-)  One of my favourite sayings was, &quot;Is that
a semaphore or are you just happy to see me?&quot;

As for a good pick up line, you could say, &quot;How about we go for pizza and a
night of loving?&quot;  When the gal says, &quot;No Way!&quot;  You say, &quot;What?  You don't
like pizza???&quot;
