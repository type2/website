Subject: Ellis cant make OCTO/Classic Weekend

I'm learning to understand that there is a reason for everything...

After missing Kelly Park, I most definitely wanted to attend the OCTO/Classic
Weekend in the worst way. Seeing old friends and getting away was looked
forward to.

Life and death issues keep me at home. Pending birth of a son and anticipated
funeral of a life long friend. A million dollars would not prevent me from
missing either one. Family/Friends first, VW's are down the list at this point.
Thanks to those willing to tow, take, drive, show or pimp the '67 Westy RFH but
I will keep it at home with me.

Everyone have fun and travel safe. Take lots of photos and post them asap for
the rest of us to enjoy.

The '67 Westy remains for sale. Pmail me for details and pricing if interested.
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
