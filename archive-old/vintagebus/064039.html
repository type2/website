&gt;
&gt; This is an unattributed copy of Ed Hackett's &quot;Oil Faq&quot; v1.2.

Ed does not go into any explaination about what happens when the plastic
polymers breakdown at 100C temp.....

For that info, go here and click on 'Viscosity Index Improvers' and then think
about all the people that use multi-grade dino oil and ask &quot;Is 250 too
hot?&quot;.....
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html

I have written Castrol repeatedly, asking them how they got past the 212F
polymer breakdown threshold to back up their slogan &quot;Engineered for Greater
Protection Against Thermal Breakdown&quot;. They refuse to answer me. BUT they did
change the slogan on the front of the oil bottles!!!  They dropped the word
'Thermal'.  Sorry, the BS lie is still on the back.
