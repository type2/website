Subject: Re: [VB] new window seals, glue???

no. but sealant does help keep water out. i knew nothing of it when i put
the glass in my first bus(66 panel camper) and it was fine, just got a
little water on the dash in heavy rains.


&gt; hi all, i just got my order in. i ordered my 2 front windshield seals and
my rear window seal. my question is, is it ABSOLUTELY necessary for me to
use window rubber glue for the seals? im going to just use these seals till
i get enough money to get my bus painted, then im going to replace all of
them again. so these are temporary seals. thanks in advance.
