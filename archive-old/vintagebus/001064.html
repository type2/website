I just took my old bumpers down to have straightened and chromed and was
amazed at what the guy could do.  He showed me a rear bus bumper that he
said was completely caved in and was now very straight. In the end, I'll end
up spending about the same as for a new set of repros.

Take a look at your old ones first; you might be surprised.
