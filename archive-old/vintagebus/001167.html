Before I go any further, I just wanted to check with all of you.  I've now
got the engine assembled out to the heads and I took a couple of pictures of
it.  Looks just like where I started last April except this engine is NEW.
I'm wondering if now would be a good time to hook up the starter and do a
compression check on the engine?  This is a step I regretted not doing on
the used engine I had before.  Anyway I managed to remember to put my
cooling baffles on underneath the cylinders.  I was so proud of myself. :-)

I think the next step will be to put oil in this thing and check for leaks
as well as prime the system to check for any crap that maybe lodged in the
oil passage prior to the oil cooler.  Once that is checked, I think I'll
start putting the cooling tins on.  Oh and I almost forgot, I should yank
the rockers and recheck the torque on these head bolts.  Any need for
loctite on these?  The rebuild book doesn't say.

Sorry this is kind of a rambled message - I'm late for an appointment and
wanted to churn this out before I left.  Later!
