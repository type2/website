The message from Dave about an 0.82 4th gear
sounds pretty good, but there is something else to
consider.

The speed of your bus does not signify the amount
of air blowing over your cylinders.  VW made the
bus this slow because of this problem.  They
considered all of the main uses for the vehicle
and made the tranny to suit.

Gene Berg did a lot of research in this field
also.  He found that a 0.77 4th gear was not right
for a bug or bus.  The engine would not turn fast
enough to get the air it needs to stay cool.

Now you want to go 15 mph faster than it was made
for, AND spin 500-1000 less rpm....it just won't
work (or won't work for long).  Spinning the
engine fast won't solve anything either.  I think
Gene figured out that at 4000 rpm, the fan is
blowing as much air as it can over the cylinders. 
So even at 4,500 rpm, the same amount of air is
cooling the engine, even with all that extra heat.

not sure where this all is going...     or what you mean by it.  With a .77 
4th I would expect someoone to have a fat motor, as a stock motor  just isn't 
going to want to push it and you will find yorself dropping into 3rd more 
often.   But are you saying the bus cools better at lower rpms or lower road 
speed.  It is my opinion (with some documentation) that there is a cooling 
CURVE, where at low rpms it does not cool as well, then the cooling increases 
with the rpms, till it hits a point where the increase in heat produced by 
the motor is more than the cooling from the fan blowing more air, or if as 
you say the dif between 4K and 4500rpms, not blowing more air.
.................
I run a 3.88 r&amp;p with the .089 4th in my stock 67
(1600cc SP, 195/75R14).  It will go 80 if I push
it.  But loaded up with camping gear and a full
roof rack, I'm lucky to get 65 (downhill,
windstorm).  Hills are a nightmare too.

funny about that.  I have a 3.88 with a 82 4th in my 65, and I assume also in 
my 61 as it tachs out the same.   Soon can report on that!!!!  But I find 
that nice, except when loaded down going in mountains.  So I drop into 3rd.  
big deal.    Thinking what is the difference beteen a 4.12 r/p and 82 4th and 
a 3.88 r/p and a 89 4th?   would think my hill pulling ability would be 
better with the 89 4th than the 82 4th keeping the same r/p, while my 3rd 
gear cruising speed would be higher.    but then on the flat  i'd get about 
the same speed.   Would be interesting to hear what speeds you get at 2K and 
3K rpms in each gear.
