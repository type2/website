So Bob took his marbles and went home - GOOD - if that's the way he wants
to act then it shows i think that he is little different than then the
snivelling whinners that find it necessary to complain for months after a
bit of sarcasm in an email.

It must be admitted that Bob did set him self up for the barage of email
that he gets.  He might as well have put up a sign that says:  &quot;Send your
stupid questions here.&quot;  Look at the list crowd - there are a number of
serious restorers and collectors, and a number of flakes that do well to
change a tire and who find it necessary to post to the list when ever they
change a light bulb (im in the later group).  Who is suprised that the
flakes (me included) find it necessary to ask hundreds of people how to
support a car when they jack it up.  It is exactly the nature of the list.

Then there are a certian number of people who refuse to recognize that
others have a right to own property.  Copyright exists for a reason.  One
of the reasons is to foster creativity.  If people are not allowed to own
intellectual property then many simply wont create intellectual property. 
Whenever you question the law or some aspect of it sit down for a moment
and try and think of the social policy behind the law.  The law is nothing
if not pragmatic.

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION

Maybe Bob could have a system whereby access to the sermons must be made
via a password - you want access you must agree to respect HIS right to own
HIS sermons, you must agree not to email him until your question is
screaned by the list, you must agree to make a reasonable effort to solve
your problem via idiot manual, sermons etc.. before you bother Bob.

It seems to me that the people who suffer now that the sermons are gone are
the people who respected his intellectual property rights - the thieves
have already downloaded the sermons.  But that is usually the way it goes
it seems.  The majority suffers becuase of the actions of a few.
