&lt;&lt; You have completely ruined my day! How did the model years run? &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
&gt;From 01AUG to 31JULY of each year.  Remember that then and even now that 
automobiles are shipped the less costly way.  Which means that they can take 
months to get to there farthest sales destinations.  Also us silly humans 
having to keep up with the &quot;Jones&quot; always want the next newest model.  So 
instead of suffering slack sales the auto manufactures.  They realised that 
if they made the model changes in late summer they would avoid these 
problems.  Just watch, this July for the new 2,000 advertisements coming out 
and shortly there after these to be out at the dealerships in August of 1999.

PS The only production VW that we know of that did not go by this since the 
model change about 1953 was the K. Ghia that came out in MAR55 and was 
considered by the manufacture as a 1956.  Though there are parts of this 
model that are very different from the 01AUG55 KGs.
