I will be traveling across country starting a week from Sat.I will be
starting by the Michigan, Indiana, IL. border and heading kinda southwest
down to I 40 West, I will be passing four corners (?) and hope that NQ is
close by or on the way, The only places I know I have a place to stay is in
New Mexico with JP or Berry or Kerry. This is a 2000 mile journey and I will
be in a Ryder with trailer with my new finds (bus content) comeing back to
AZ, if anybody is on this route and can offer me a driveway it would be
great or wave as I pass through.

ronnie

please p-mail me if you have any questions of my route or would like to meet
me. My goal is to be back in Az by the following tuesday, have to do at
least 700 miles a day. If somebody has nothing to do and would like to ride
back, also let me know.

520   680=7664
