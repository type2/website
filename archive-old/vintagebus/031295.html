At the Lake Havasu, AZ show three years ago there was a guy who asked me
three different times if I was interested in selling my '66 right hand
drive Westy.  This is a pretty nice low mileage original condition bus
that I brought  from New Zealand when we moved from there to Tucson.  He
was not part of the Arizona Bus Club and had no vehicle in the camp
ground.  He also did not look like a bus person, whatever that means.
I kind of thought that he was a car buyer but I didn't quiz him on what
he was up to.  I also did not ask him to make an offer so I can't
comment on whether or not he wanted to low ball me.   I think that to
some extent that we are liable to be mined by business people.  In AZ,
we are an easy mark.   Modest income folk enjoying the best of what type
2's have to offer.  Others with more will always try to trade away our
quality of life...
