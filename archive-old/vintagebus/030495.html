(long msg, but I don't write too often... sorry + thanks)

Hello list,
I just returned home from visiting my folks in Taiwan. After reading all
the e-mail from the list I feel I should contribute to this thread in
particular, hopefully to provide another perspective as part of the
Asian contingent. Sorry to reply so late, as most of you are tired of
it, perhaps.

I have only one bus. A 66 camper. I am not a hoarder, but I do dream of
eventually changing our household vehicle lineup to all classical VW
air-cooled. My other vehicles are MGB, 4Runner, and Ford Escort
wagon--all could be replaced with ol' VeeDubs, and hopefully so. Be it
Bugs, Type3 or Bus, I love them all; they are the only cars that make me
turn my head on the road nowadays. Own one for a while, and one would
appreciate the beauty in their designs and purposefulness.

After taking up the homely restoration on the Westy, I have learned that
quite a few made-in-Taiwan parts that's not reliable. Sad for me
especially, but I do heed the advice, for I love my bus and rather not
encourage the 2nd-best craftsmanship from the land I was born. You and I
both know they can make better stuff, like the semi-conductors hidden in
front of us... it's the not-so-skilled folks that dwell on lousy copies
of auto parts, and I wish more than anyone that they would put in more
efforts on parts re-pro.

Yes things come and go in fads sometimes. I know nothing about Porche
356, but I've seen bell bottom pants come and go, and come again. Yet
for you and I, we appreciate what made Busses and gang stand out
throughout these years. We understand that it symbolizes more than a
mode of transportation. As John Muir have so wisely shown us, it is a
way of life, a statement and belief of our existence. Maybe some of us
got so well versed in it that they can rely on them for a living.
Nothing wrong with that! Trading old VW's sure is neither crime nor sin,
and on the contrary should be encouraged. It's a great philosophy, and I
only wish more can see what the classic VWs have that today's cars are
missing.

While I was back in Taiwan, I so eagerly wanted to spot one on the
street, the ol' Bus. You know, you who took snapshots of busses foreign,
here and there. Too bad the kinship/tribesmen ship, the backbone of our
clubs everywhere, was never rewarded. I saw none on the street of
Taipei. I thought, &quot;If one day I am returning Taiwan to live there,
count on me to be bussing around, with luggage racks even! (I just got
mine made by Tom Conners in WA, boy they are great!)&quot; I feel that if
properly introduced, Taiwanese folks, specifically the smart and
tasteful ones, would find them irresistible just like we do. It's a pity
that they missed out and don't even know it.

One recent magazine mentioned a craze in Japan for ol' VDubs. I wish I
was there to see it! Yes their English might not be quite that savvy,
but I thought ol' VDubs themselves spell out a language to us all? Over
here we even had enough grammar to regulate what's to be said on Friday
only. Cheesy assimilation to Engrish culture does not a lousy Japanese
VW owner make?! Superb English commands does not a great lawyer make,
unless he's cool enough to show up in court in his Bus? If I were
Japanese I'd be proud for the appreciation they showed on the air-cooled
front. As to them gobbling it all up: I am wondering if somewhere in
Japan there's a person drooling about the ol' bus, but has not enough to
afford one. We happen to fall in love w/ out-of-print editions, us all.
Affordability only gets more scarce. That's the nature of it. Some
profit from it, some see it getting further out of reach, but all are in
it for the beauty of it. It's the taste that brings us in as a group,
sharing the same affection. Please do not blame the scarcity of
out-of-print editions on its collectors? There are other limited edition
items that no one rather collects, like a nuclear power plant. I don't
see anyone arguing about who has them all. Its all in the market. This
point has been made by others before me, so I stop here.

I was hoping, back in Taipei, that amongst the tens of thousands of
scooters and taxis would emerge me in a 2-toned bus all shiny and proud,
putting about like &quot;Turbomium&quot;, and make me the envy of town. Is that
your feelings already wherever you're at? Good for you. Let others get a
taste of what it feels like then, if they seek? Be a wised one in the
tribe who guides the seeking then?

My long, wordy 2 cents.
Ricky
