Scott,

How about sitting in the drivers seat of your bus every other day for half an
hour or so, dreaming of hitting the open road, instead of getting off your ass
and putting in the brake system you bought two months ago that keeps you from
hitting the open road.  HA HA  Talk about a lack of priorities and waste of
time.

Anyways, for that matter, who has the newest of all the models?  Who has the
last 23 window? There are a couple more ways to waste somebodies time, I've got
enough to do...sitting in mine and all.

&gt; Ok, so it's late at night and I've got an idea. Actually, I've had this
&gt; idea for awhile but now's the time to get it out there and share...Everyone
&gt; is always looking for the oldest bus, the prototype, Barndoor number
&gt; 20-00001 (or whatever!). Why not go the other way and look for the youngest
&gt; split? Any of you 67 owners out there ever compare chassis numbers and see
&gt; who's is newest?
&gt;
&gt; According to the numbers at www.splitwindow_dot_com we're looking for number
&gt; 217 148 459 produced in July of 1967. Of course, maybe this is even more of
&gt; a waste of time than I first thought...maybe it's sitting in the museum in
&gt; Wolfsburg? Anyone know? Anyone care?
&gt;
&gt; Ok...off to bed now!
