Hey List

I have this can of paint called Zero-Rust
(http://www.zerorust_dot_com/index.html.)  Last fall I applied the stuff to
the roof of my bus directly on rust without any sort of preparation at
all and the rust still hasn't revealed itself no big suprise maybe,
considering it was not that long ago and  covered for the winter and i
read somewhere that rust is less active in really cold weather, but that
was in a spray can, this time i have a quart.

It contains Methyl Propyl Ketone (107-97-9), Xylene (133-20-7), N-Butyl
Acetate (123-86-4), Napta (6472-95-6), Magnesium Silicate
(14807-96-6).   Maximum V.O.C. 400 grams/liter.  (What the does that all
mean?)

I don't see zinc listed anywhere.  A recent posting mentioned that high
zinc content is essential for rust control.

My plan is too apply this stuff with a paint brush to the interior of my
bus on the cargo floor and the interior of the doors etc.... and
anywhere that will not be visible once i insulate and put the interior
panels back in.  I'm thinking about maybe using Rust-Seal (formic acid),
or Rust-mort (75% phosphric acid) on the surface rust on the interior
before applying the Zero-Rust, though that maybe unnecessary and could
even be detrimental as i plan on removing as much of the rust as
possible first with a wire brush and apparently the rust treatment
chemicals don't work if there isn't rust present.

I also plan on using this method on the underneath of my bus.  Once I
clean all of the black stuff off and wire brush, scrape, etc... then
Rust-Mort, Zero-Rust, the black stuff, then old oil to penetrate any
seams then spray the underneath with old oil every year.  I'll drill a
few small holes into the outriggers and spray lots of Rust-Seal into
those, and they'll also get an annual oil spray treatment.  I plan on
putting in a gas heater next fall and using my bus occasionally in the
winter for ski trips etc... Not as a winter daily driver but as an
occasional winter driver and a summer daily driver.  (It would really be
stupid to drive my bus all winter as there is just too much salt and
sand on the roads here.)

Well, i guess im wasting bandwidth and ought to make my point, which is,
is anyone familiar with Zero-Rust, is my plan good,  how could i improve
it.  I sand blasted the cargo area floor last summer, used dupont metal
conditioner (5717S) this chemical that isnt phosphoric acid but some
other acid that is supposed to be applied on bare steel before priming,
then i primed and the rust is through already, granted it is very
minimal but that is not reassuring.  But in the cab area floors i didn't
sand blast but used rust-mort and aerosol zero-rust paint and there is
no sign of rust.  What concerns me is that Zinc is not mentioned
anywhere on the Zero-Rust, and my experience with it is covers less than
1 year.

thanks again list
