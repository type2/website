George, et al;

I disagree...(with most, apparently...)  The description is ambiguous.
 Only in the fact that the &quot;1600DP&quot; motor is listed in the &quot;Goodies -
Extra Parts&quot; section of the ad.  To me that implies that there is an
&quot;extra&quot; motor.

&quot;extra parts include 12V fuel gauge,67 fuel tank with sender,1 set of
58-61 tail lights with NOS glass, clear needle speedo,
complete set of polished jail bars and rear deluxe seat, polished coat
hooks (2) church key, original key opens a doors 1600DP motor
complete not installed condition unknown. &quot;

Might be time to notify ebay that the sale did not complete and try again.

Just MHO.
