Subject:  BBB V &amp; reviving my 61 deluxe
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi folks,  I am writing this to the list as I have received a number of 
pmails re BBBV, and no, I stayed home and did not go.  SO this is my what I 
did while I was not at BBBV report.  I spent a number of hours reviving my 61 
deluxe, which is an ongoing process.   
to put this in perspective, I took this bus off the road after driving back 
from Kelley Park april a year and 9 months ago.  there was a noise from the 
back that bothered me, and the $35 swap meet tranny that had 20K miles since 
began to be harder to shift, and changing th oil showed more and more 
shavings. so tokk it out, found the gearing, got it rebulild, and got 
interested in other things, and red bus just sat in the garage a long time.

For some reason, the transmission assembling took ages,   finding good axle 
shafts, and every parts of getting it into a installable transaxle just took 
time and more time.   One major set back was the amount of play at the axle 
shafts where they go into the center section.   there was too much, even with 
only one paper shim between the flange.   AFter bugging folks about this, and 
no one having had this, I was given the suggestion to shim up the Kaiser 
Spheres (aka daisy wheels) so I said what the hey, and ground two Kspheres 
down to shim the tubes out so that with some paper shimes under the flange 
there is the correct amount of friction, and no thunk thunk.   

Then one of the axle tubes/RGB went on fine.  However the drivers side had 
something funy with the way the inner upper bearing shifted in the housing, 
then when the tube was on the gear was slightly tilted which is a fine recipe 
for self destruction.  I tried a bunch of stuff, then decided the whole axle 
tube.rghousing was junk.  as it was on the side where the upper outer bearing 
had gone bad (ball bearings falling off when I removed the outer housing and 
bouncing around) and so I think it hammered the inner upper bearing around 
enough.  DId I mention that the upper gear had started to eat into the outer 
housing?  The RGs were not all that noisy, really, amazingly.   so I put a 
different axle tube/housing on it.  and put the bit all together and the axle 
shaft is nice and snug not sloppy yea. and assemble some brake parts etc, and 
i'd put NOS bushing in the shifting andNathan helped me lift teh transaxle 
off the workbench and install it in the bus wow check out the space.  Okay 
that was a week ago on Friday.   Then I sorted out the motor with new oil 
cooler sealsand main seals and a fuel pump as I thin the old one leaked into 
the oil, and a generator and put the thermostat stuff in and had to find a 
smaller fan belt as I have a small pulley on the generator (will it be 
coller?  I dunno, I could put guages in and see)

So got the brakes bled and the motor in.    low battery.  Had to charge it a 
bit, stas right up.  Drove it out, swept up the garage, and drove in in 
facing the other way. let it run about 20 minutes, and drained the oil.

Funnny thing is one day it poured , but most of the past week has been warm 
and sunny and looks like it again today.

went and bought a 12V tire pumper upperer at Schmucks for about 27$ as the 
tires were all low (one flat- I had put a 14 on instead at that corner) and I 
always wanted one of those for road trips- like if you are retreiving a bus 
from somewhere with low tires.

still needs some things.  I'm replacing the seals in the air vent as it 
leaked before- needs the top of the drivers side window (why did I take it 
off?), tags are expired, dumb DP carb doesn't idle well. Maybe I should take 
off the stuff piled on the roof rack.
 not too bad huh  almost drivable.   but I wish I had a digicam and could 
show you the front floor (I had to take the mat out to make it easier to put 
the stick shift back in)   it is swiss cheese.  This is an OG safari bus.  
The hole the brake pedal goes through is rusted larger.  there are holes of 
course at the front corner unde r the major drip, but there are holes 
randomly and cracks everywhere.   I guess I will bite the bullet eventually 
and cut and weld (I have a perfect floor to put in) but just now I feel like 
I want to drive this guy.  It is such the cool bus.  and he looks so proud 
and alive now.   I think maybe he was sad and worried being neglected for so 
long.  but at least not left in the rain.   Okay I am getting froo froo here, 
but this is really one awesome bus.   when I get my tags I will do an RPM 
report  the tranny is a 4.37 with .82 4th with 1.26 RGBoxes.   (it does have 
a 64/65 front beam)

okay bye,

Clara
