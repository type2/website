Hi John,
To stop the heat exchangers from blowing heat into the interior you just need 
to slacken off the heater cable clamps.  As for blocking off the fresh air to 
the heat exchangers this is not a good idea at all!  The heat exchangers have 
a double valve which when the heat is shut off to the interior of the VW it 
vents a small amount of air through the heat exchangers and out through a 
clamshell like vent on the rear of the forward end of the exchangers.  
Without this cooling air the heat exchangers just get hotter and hotter till 
the exaust gases coming out of #1 &amp; #3 cylinders do not condense but keep 
expanding which not only heats up these cylinders due to the high temps of 
the exchangers under and connected to them, but due to added exhaust back 
pressure!  Also oil temp will rise at least 20F more!   Eric&amp;Barb
