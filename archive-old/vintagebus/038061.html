To All:

I'm been working on Grendel's noze, tying to straighten out the results of at
least three collisions.  The dents are coming out fairly well -- I'll probably
need a few gallons of Bondo to smooth things up, which is barely a quarter of
the Bondo I excavated to get down to bare metal.  Progress :-)

But the rust around the windscreens is far worse than I expected.  After
removing the seals &amp; glass several large holes were evident.  Today I went
after the inner lip with a flapper-wheel.  The metal vanished in a powdery
cloud of rust.  And revealed some interesting details about the anatomy of the
metalwerk around splittie windscreens.

The nose-skin stops at the windscreen, just abaft the kick-up where the wiper
shafts come through.  The windscreen sheet-metal overlaps the nose-skin in
front and butts up against the dashboard sheet-metal to the rear.  The
matching lip on the dashboard is bent upwards (you can see this by inspecting
it from the inside) to match the lip on the windscreen sheet-metal.  The two
lips are then spot-welded together about every two inches to form the flange
that captures the rubber seal.

But where the windscreen sheet-metal overlaps the nose-skin, there were only
five spot-welds in twenty inches, making this a virtually open joint.  Of
course, it's out of sight, tucked up in the attic under the dash.

Unfortunately, the radius of the nose-skin and the windscreen sheet-metal are
different -- they are not an especially tight fit.  And the curve of the nose-
skin serves to collect and hold any condensation that may form under the dash.

 This joint is going to rust whether you have good seals or not.   And if you
have bad seals it will rust that much faster.

You can get at the inboard edge of this poorly welded seam with a wand-type
applicator and probably get some Waxol or other body-panel sealant into the
space but the odds are, the seam is already rusty -- it's just a matter of
time before you'll have to replace it.

I'm replacing a lot of sheet-metal on Grendel -- rocker panels, jacking
points, wheel wells, most of the floor(s), all of the rear body below the
hatch, lower portions of the cargo-bay doors, lower portion of the front door
sills... and the lower portion of both windscreens.  I ordered replacement
panels from Mill Supply, JC Whitney, two local (socal) sources and Das Bulli
Haus but I've found the quality generally very poor  regardless of the source.
Consequently, I've been making most of the panels myself.  I'd planned to use
.050&quot; stock to rebuild the windscreen sheet-metal but after seeing the extent
of the rust, I cut it back a bit farther and am using a bar of .125 x .75
stock to rebuild the lower portion of the recess, using .090&quot; stock to
fabricate the lip.  Before welding in the lower portion of the recess I'll
passivate the rusted lip of the nose skin.  After welding, I'll try to seal
the space with Waxol (or similar).

I found similar water-traps in the design of the rear jacking points and two
of the frame cross-members.  The rear jacking points have several opening
facing forward that can scoop in anything thrown up by the front wheels.  The
joke here is that the openings are larger than the drain -- the space can
collect objects larger than it can get rid of, meaning it will eventually
become blocked.  Once blocked, the space forms a perfect water-trap.  The
cross-member has the same design flaw -- holes where stuff can get into the U-
section cross-member are larger than the drain. All four of mine (two rear
jacking points and two U-section cross-members) were solid with silt &amp; gravel,
as were both rocker panels -- there wasn't much metal left.  Might be worth
your while to take a look.
