&gt; Since my Leatherman has several blades &amp; tools
&gt; broken, I went to Sportstown 
&gt; the other night to step up to a SuperTool, since
&gt; they had them on sale for 
&gt; $39 (regular $59).
&gt; 
&gt; I got home &amp; looked up their website and there is a
&gt; vintage bus reference 
&gt; on the site.  Go to
&gt; http://www.leatherman_dot_com/default_frame.html 
&gt; 
&gt; and scroll down to the sales pitch on the Leatherman
&gt; Flair...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm more of a Guiness man myself, so I did not need
&gt; the girly corkscrew...
