If you own a shop and have insurance, overhead, a mark-up on parts and have
employees to pay labor to, workmens comp. and they do a complete job,
master,wheel cylinders,hoses, shoes, turn drums, repack/replace front
bearings, replace all hoses, etc. figure 8 to 10 hours labor, at Pheonix
shop rate of 55 per hour, that's 550.00 in labor alone, so 700 dollars could
be a bargin. I know of a person in Phoenix who went to a highly recomended
VW shop and paid over 800 dollars for a complete brake job, no new drums or
metal lines, but everything else replaced, (no new hardware), so if you
deduct labor you can do a brake job for substantualy less yourself, or have
a friend help, buy the Bentley (around $75.00) it's less then the labor and
you get a good book out of the deal. Get hold of the bus Co-op in New Mexico
and let JP,Jon and/or Berry help you. Jon works at Foriegn Aid so he can
help you on parts and JP and Berry can do or will help you do the work.

Make your way to Albuquerque and hook up with JP
Henrikse at the Bus Co-op &lt;JPHenrikse_at_aol_dot_com&gt; or
order a Bentley's Workshop Manual 1963-1967 and do it
yourself. Doing a brake job &quot;the right way&quot; is not
hard even for a novice mechanic. It is *very* basic. A
few tricks help but is basically watching how parts
come apart and replacing them the same way.
First determine/isolate the systems' fault(s) prior to
abitrarily replacing everything just for the fun of
spending money. Repair and/or replace the offending
problem or part(s). I do agree that brakes are not a
system to skimp on. Make sure that the system is solid
prior to driving your beast! Keeping your health is a
priority. 

Don't be afraid of anything exception being the ripoff
artist who floated the $700 bid. There are only five
million VW bus lovers in New Mexico. Swing a dead cat
on a short rope and you'll probably hit one.
