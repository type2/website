called a bunch of people who build VW trannys today. (Wed)

----&gt;  No one know about early/late fulcrum plates, so they wouldn't know it
the noise mine made would be typical of a trans with mismatched plates.
&lt;----

It was chewing itself up lik a dog with a flea allergy - three of 4 plates had
small bits broken off in 150 miles (not good at all) - is this enough to do
what it did?   Would this be the cause of the noises I heard?   A simple
question, I hoped.  ha.    I figure they are chewed because of the
mismatchedness.

The guy at rancho laughed at me when I said, yes there are differnt kinds, so
I said firmly that  I wanted to speak to someone who knew more than he did.
(good p r there, d%^kweed)   The next guy was nice,  but he didn't know about
these early flat (no rockability) plates, as different from the later ones
which when you put them rounded side down on a flat surface there is
rockability end to end (.2mm by the book) and also seemed to suspect I was
making it up.       Told him I found the info in a book- the VW book by VW for
VW, and have some of the early plates.      Sometimes I  it seems very
difficult for these guys to take me (aus frau?) halfway seriously, and even if
they know what they are talking about, they can't say it.  Wish they 'd take
off the blinkers.    No one else I talked to knew of early/late fulcrum
plates.     Wierd

Fighting my way through molasses.  Need a tranny guru who has been doing it 20
+ years who has heard of the early fulcrum plates for a tad of advice.  Need
Nellie on the road.  Went out to get coffee and the clutch cable in my bug
snapped, so I didn't get coffee, but speed shifted my way home.   Not my best
day.  

Lay  on the couch for a hour mind blank staring into space.  Cat curled upon
me, very fuzzy.

Woo woo time.   Meditate on the tranny.    let it say if it is happy. 

okay, here I go.    

Clara
