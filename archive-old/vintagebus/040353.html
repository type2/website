&gt; &gt; To help in your preparations, you might want to peruse
&gt; &gt; VW Werke's Technical Recommendation Z4, Journeys Under
&gt; &gt; Difficult Conditions.  You can find the 1984 edition at
&gt; &gt; &lt;http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties/index1.html&gt;.
&gt; &gt; I also have the 1960 edition scanned, but not set up and
&gt; &gt; online yet.
&gt; &gt; ------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to see this! please post a URL when
&gt; &gt; available!!
&gt; &gt;

I put that doc online. It is VW Service Bulletin Z4, September 1960,
&quot;Instructions for Tropical Climate Operation&quot;.

You can see it at:
http://www.mg.co.za/mg/oldvolks/z4contents.html

Jim, and anyone else, please feel free to rip it off and repost it
elsewhere. The site where it currently resides is a former employer of mine,
and there's no saying how long it will stay there.
