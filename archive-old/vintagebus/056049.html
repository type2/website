Subject: Re: [VB] Swamp cooler on my bus.

&gt; Now the questions
Okay.........

&gt; To fit the &quot;single piece of plexi&quot; right to hold the swamp cooler? Our
cooler requires the &quot;glass&quot; to go up to lock in in the channel, how s this
done?

I had to remove from the frame, the metal piece with the window channels in
it, then put the swamper in the top of the frame (holding the frame upside
down on the ground), then put the plexi in, then put the bottom metal
channel back on.  The only way to remove the swamper, is to remove the frame
from the door, and remove the bottom channel.

 &gt;Does this &quot;blow on the passenger a lot?
Not that bad, actually.  Then again, I usually just cruise the freeway at
60-63mph, so there's not a lot of speed there.

&gt;  Do you have a inside pic?
No, but that's a damned good idea.  I'll get one up later tonight, I have to
go to a class right now......

&gt; Did this require any mods to the frame?
Nope.  I only had to remove the two pieces of glass, and that's it.

I'll work on an inside pic, and post when I have that updated.
