Subject: Re: Hauling stuff

I, too, cherish my Splitties for their load carrying capacity. Over the
years, I've owned mostly vans (a Chev, 2 Fords, about 9 Splits, and 2
Bays). The VWs had more headroom in the center section (no driveline
under the floor), more ground clearance, and were rated for a heavier
payload (on 1 Ton rated Splits). The volume of payload is significant
too, but probably not as high as the big vans I've had. And I too have
hauled loads that amazed/impressed family and friends... it's pretty
cool!

Be careful, though, you _can_ break the torsion bars! In fact, I'm sure
you can wreak all sort of havoc on your suspension that would be
hard/expensive to fix (spindles, king pins, etc). I've personally never
broken a rear torsion bar, but I know someone that has broken one in
each of two 3/4 ton Splitties... swore VW's were a POS and ignored the
fact that he abused the hell out of everything he ever owned or touched!
(end rant)

I don't have the load ratings for Busses in front of me, but I'm sure
I've got them in a book or something and they should be readily
available. I advise leaving a margin for age; the load ratings were
probably not calculated to be accurate for 35 years/200k mls of wear!

When in doubt or when the load is really ugly, I use my utility trailer
to the hilt. I would rather destroy its suspension than my Bus'; the
leaf springs I've broken were easier and cheaper to replace and it's
easier to load/unload. Make sure the load is balanced to minimize tongue
weight (Tongue weight should be about 10% of loaded trailer weight).

&gt; I once took my 67 doublecab to the quarry to get a load of gravel.  Weighed
&gt; in at 2600 lbs, had the guy with the front-end loader fill it up real good.
&gt;  Weighed out at 5500 lbs, for a net 2900 lbs of gravel.  Yikes!
&gt; 
&gt; I took it easy on the way home...
&gt; 
&gt; Not many small trucks will carry more than their own weight...
