Howdy bus folks,

Long time no post....just been lurkin' for the past several months.  First 
things first, I've got a used 34 PICT 3 off the 63EZ up for grabs.  If anyone 
one the list is interested p-mail me.

Anyways...seeing VanBondo's post regarding the kids gave me a good 
chuckle.(quick tip---forget the music-dope the little bastards up on 
childrens' tylenol and play whatever the hell you want)..that's the main 
reason I haven't been doing much with the bus either on-line or real life.  
Hell, the last show the bus went to was OCTO in June.  The bus has had the 
engine pulled for 2 or 3 months now....waiting for me to get off my ass and 
re-seal and fix misc. other crap that it needs.

Finally ordered the last few parts from Ronnie and then I just need to kick 
my ass back into gear.  I'm hoping to take the bus to the OCTO show coming up 
in a week or two.  

Mike Alcorn...p-mail me, I lost your addy---again =)

Beto
