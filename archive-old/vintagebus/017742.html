Subject: monterey, ca to phoenix, az

i'm getting a little bit of static about driving alone to arizona.  i am leaving early evening today - prolly around 5.  my route is monterey past bakersfield to los angeles and on to phoenix with a hopeful e.t.a. of thursday noon in phoenix.  is there anyone along the way that would like a road companion?  my single cab goes 55 and is almost assured not to breakdown.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
