Subject: Re: [VB] Was Bus Engines, Now More Cooling

how about cleaning out the flashing from the head fins.  If you take a head 
and look there, at the casting seam there is all this crud blocking the gaps 
between the fins.   clean that out ( with a file, drill, saw, whatever) and 
more air flows, carrying the heat away.  You'll be surprised at how much 
metal dust you end up with.

That and the type IV doghouse worked for me.
