Subject: RE: [VB] help on engine black paint

Its not the sheen I'm concerned with as that is easy to adjust... I just
don't want the blobby powder coat look hence my thoughts on lacquer.
However, I am interested in a product that is gas and oil resistant....
that's the question.

Stan suggested:
Automotive paint companies have a glaze reducer that you add to paint.
You just get the color you want and mix the glaze reducer.
It just takes a little experimenting to get the semi flat finish you
want.
