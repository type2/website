&gt;any parts for em? i've got a handful i'd like to fool with on a 40hp, bu=
t
none have caps/rotors/points.

ent

it's in the archives if you search for bastard engine info.

it was years ago.  For the correct restoration minded people, they don't
sell the original L-style rotors or correct brown-colored dizzy caps, exc=
ept
for when they have a limited supply of NOS units.
