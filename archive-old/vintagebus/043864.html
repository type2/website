hi all,

We returned successfully from our adventure, and it was indeed an
adventure. Thank you to all who offered kindnesses, with the hectic nature
of the last couple of weeks I am sorry I havent composed replies with
thanks to everyone, the trip has worn me out. 5500 miles in 2 weeks. I've
done 4500 in a week in my 71, but this seemed like more for some reason.

(could be driving straight through from western nevada to saint louis
missouri that tired us out...)

Notable sightings, a green &amp; white 64+ splitty in corvalis, OR.  A 58-60
panel camper in Newport OR. A bunch of later splitties in CA, an early
splitty with safaris on Haight street, and a 64+ single cab in the nevada
desert on Hwy 50.  We saw too many eurovans and vanagons to count, and
quite a few baywindows as well, oh and got up close and personal with a
black bear in the redwoods. (well 100 yards at the closest, personal
enough for me, heh.) I'll be putting pictures on my site someday soon
(like in the next week)

Anyway, we made it home but my engine overheated the whole way
practically. And everything seems to be right, I cant figure it out.

* 1641 DP with 6.8 or 6.9:1 compression
* no exhaust leaks
* Jetting right (140 mains, 55 idles, dual weber ICT, slightly black
	plugs no vacuum leaks)
* Kool tins, all tin Stock, sealed up &amp; in proper place
* doghouse shroud, hoover bit, brand new brazillian cooler
* thermostat and flaps functioning properly (disconected just in case, no
	help there)
* Turning 63-6400 RPM at 60
* oil pressure 10-14 at ilde 42 at speed
* all engine comp seals in place (even around the wires!)
* tried both with tubes from shroud to heaterboxes, and with tubes blocked
off for more air to the heads. No difference.

temps ranged from 220-230 or so in cooler weather to 260 in the
desert.  By driving 55 or so we could usually keep it under 240, unless it
was over 90 out then it was 250 all the way, spiking to 260 uphill at
times. I would say the gague lies, but we had major vapor lock problems
and putting spit or water on the block it boiled instantly, so it was too
hot.

Idling would cool it down, as would driving slowly through a town. I tend
not to think gear ratios is the problem as it overheated in third uphill
as easily as in 4th on the flats. But that is really my last guess....

I checked the valves and none were stretching that I could tell.

Any ideas appreciated, my ideas are:
* the oil pressure relief spring is a non-stock item, perhaps it is
somehow keeping a higher pressure at the expense of flow? (i/e less oil
circulates as it is at a higher pressure...) i will test this theory by
puting a stock spring back in.

* CR too low, the engine has to overwork to keep speeds up?

* Transaxle geared too high. 6300 at 60 might be off, i *think i have a
64-66 tranny with 27 inch tires but it could be 67 gearing?? i am going to
put a small nut back in on principle I think.

* transaxle put together wrong. Perhaps this transaxle was assembled by an
amateur and the diff shims arent in right leading to a high rolling
resistance...

* .60 over linebore making this thing a heater rather than a cool engine.

* Just in case webers are the problem i'll try a stock carb.

* header hits rear apron, thus heating up metal in engine compartment at
the rear.

Any suggestions appreciated, I'm not taking another road trip till I can
get it to stay under 240 in the hottest weather I can find. I might just
tear it down and rebuild again, maybe with a new case... *sigh* a
neverending obsession this bus stuff is... i could put on an external
cooler, but know it can be fixed to work without one and hate to cheat.

take care,

Steve

P.S. perhaps this bus is just posessed, or wants something of me and I
havent been listening to it ask... what are you saying dear greyhound? new
paint? Bodywork? safaris? a radio? an extra battery? what will make you
happy...
