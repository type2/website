Were are the early westy interior parts?
i'm interested in obtaining them for my 61 Kombi
Matson says that i can't ship a Bus with a bed to Hawaii so I'm going to
convert here
in Hawaii
the west coast of the mainland U.S.  or central MO. would be a good place
for me to hunt these parts and then crate them and ship em  home
