Subject: Buying a used engine

Hi all,

As you may or may not remember, I'm building a '65 standard and had to
put the (early) '59 deluxe on the back burner.  Well even though it's on
the back burner, I'm always keeping an eye out for parts.  So any ways,
I may have found a 36 horse for it and am going to look at it this
weekend.  Supposedly it turns over, is complete (less and after market
exhaust).  Does anybody have an anal type inspection procedure for
inspecting a used engine?  What kind of clearances and the like can I
check for with out breaking down the engine?

Thanks everybody,
Aaron
