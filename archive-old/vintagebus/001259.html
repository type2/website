&gt;&gt;  The earlier/Barndoor style (pre-March 8, 1956) has a smaller license plate  portion which equates to a longer ribbed piece: http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/scrapbook/bdfrontbumper.jpg

&gt; hey Everett, where did you get the March 8 56 bumper change date from?  
&gt;
The data Hannover started producing Buses, correct?

I'm sure there were some left-over bumpers, though, so the change probably didn't technically start then, like all things VW.
