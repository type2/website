Subject: Re: [VB] Oil strainers-Magnetized?

Al,
  I found some super magnets in an old computer hard drive and stuck it to =
the outside of the drain plate to capture the ferrous bits of metal. Much =
more powerful than the magnetic drain plugs. Find 'em on E-Bay or tear =
apart old 8&quot; hd's. The companion magnet is on my fridge and snags any beer =
bottle cap that comes within 6&quot; of it!=20
Don't think magnetic screens are made, and I wouldn't use 'em if they are. =
Better to trap the metal at the bottom of the sump, not in the direct flow =
of oil.=20

I need to stock up on these, and hear (like all damn parts now) there
are ones to avoid with larger screen mesh...How has these in the correct
mesh then?
I need the larger style (interior top hole) one, I think the 175B, gotta
rip it out to check, but I have tons of the smaller ones, no larger.
Seems that they all have squished mesh, the kind I need. Will have part
no to buy the right ones, just want to know where they are.

Has anyone experimented with magnetic screens?

Al
