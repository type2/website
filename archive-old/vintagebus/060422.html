It's time to get ready for Picasso Moon (Sept. 6 - Sept. 8), so pack the =
bus, the dog(s), the kid(s) and the cooler-we're heading to the =
mountains!!

http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_net/PicassoMoon.html

We're planning on doing something different on Saturday night for =
dinner-no chili cook-off.  We were not able to change the web page, so =
pass the info along!!  We're going to grill kabobs!  Bring cubed meat =
and/or vegis, we'll put it all out and you can create your own =
masterpiece! We'll provide the skewers and will have 3 grills going.  =
Also bring a side dish (salad, rice, pasta, etc.) to share.

We will be posting the combination to the gate on Thursday, Sept. =
5...however, the gate will more than likely be left unlocked.  We will =
also have signs to help you find your way.  For those of you that have =
not been to this camp out in the past....don't worry about the creek =
crossing...it's very tame.

email us if you have questions,
Brent &amp; Debbie Jarrett=20

Could someone please post to Vanagon list... Please....Or any other bus =
lists
