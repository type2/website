Subject: Re: [VB] RE: oil temp.

I think you are on the right track. The warmest part of the engine would be
inside the combustion chamber. The location between the top of the piston
and the inside of the head near the exhaust valve too. After that the heat
conducts through the metal to all the other parts.

&gt; I wonder whether there is a point where the engine temps increase faster
&gt; than the oil temp?  When pushed hard, my engine smells a little hot when
&gt; I stop for gas (different than normal), even though the oil temp is
&gt; within &quot;normal&quot; ranges.  With an added cooler, perhaps the higher
&gt; readings are &quot;inaccurate&quot; (low), in relation to increases in head temp.
&gt; At a minimum, it seems like there would be a lag.
