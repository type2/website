Subject: Re: [VB] Dead mouse...

Every bus has the obligatory &quot;dead mouse&quot; mine was in the compartment under
the driver's seat, he was months beyond smelling bad, but the smell from the
huge nest he and his pals left in my westy's overhead rear storage cabinet
took months to neutralize.

&gt;
&gt; I found a crispy mouse stuck in a hole under the dash of my 67 beetle when
I
&gt; started restoring it, (guess he thought he could fit!)the shopvac took
care
&gt; of him though (he was beyond smell)
&gt;
&gt; later,

&gt;
&gt; UUUUGGGG.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, my suspicions are confirmed ~vomits loudly in the corner~.
&gt;
&gt; There is a dead mouse in my heater tube somewhere.  His nest started
&gt; spitting out of the heat vents the last few times i drove...but there was
&gt; no smell.
&gt;
&gt; I stuck my head in the bus the other day (been sitting a week or so at
&gt; that time...be two weeks this next friday) and OIY.  smlled like dead
&gt; mouse.
&gt;
&gt; Today the sun was out so i opened her up...she aired out decently.  But, i
&gt; started her up and turned the heat on....and in just a few minutes....OIY.
&gt; yuck.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions for getting the bugger out? Or should i just get the
&gt; oil temp up around 220 on a nice 90+ degree day (like today...) and cook
&gt; him? maybe cooked-dead-rotten-mouse doesnt smell as bad?   Or maybe he's
&gt; already cooked and now he's a rotting dead cooked mouse. mmm.
&gt;
&gt; UG.
&gt;
&gt; help?
