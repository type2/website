Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

Ron is correct in that I messed up on the dates.  It was Dec and not Nov.  I
want to make sure everyone understands that the order placed on the 7th was
completed and shipped in good time for a company.  The order I problems with
before was corrected and an expectable apology was made.  The other item was
more then likely a cross in numbers since there was no message on my machine
and I was home that evening.

&gt; &gt;  I took folks advice about calling to check availability of parts that I
&gt; needed soon.
&gt; &gt; Young man on the phone was polite and informed me (8 Nov) that the
&gt; Jackpoint I
&gt; &gt; needed was  available for shipping.  Well,  today I thinking &quot;it was
&gt; available&quot; it should
&gt; &gt; be here by now.  Guess what, the order was cancelled and I WAS NOT
&gt; CONTACTED.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dave,
&gt;
&gt; It was actually recently (December, not November) when you placed the
order.
&gt; Perhaps the jackpoint sold out between the time that you called to check
&gt; stock, and the time that your order was entered/processed.  If there are
&gt; only one or two of an item in stock, this can of course happen.
&gt;
&gt; That said, it is not true that you were not contacted.  In fact, I can
even
&gt; tell you WHEN you were contacted. At approximately 5 pm E.S.T. on Friday,
&gt; December 14, Mike left a message on your voice mail to say that the item
was
&gt; out of stock for at least a month, and that you'd be best off re-ordering.
&gt; Before doing this, he spent quite a while calling around to other
&gt; distributors first, in the hope that he could still locate one for you
&gt; elsewhere and have it dropshipped to you at our additional expense.  But
&gt; unfortunately all of our suppliers were also out of stock, since the
&gt; backorder originated from the manufacturer.  When he left that message, he
&gt; immediately documented in your customer file both the date and the reason
&gt; for his call to you, which is why I know all of this with such certainty.
(I
&gt; have been insisting that my employees do so, just so I can check up on
this
&gt; sort of complaint. So I researched it and indeed found the record of the
&gt; call. I even spoke to Mike myself just to be absolutely sure and he
&gt; specifically remembered leaving the message.)
&gt;
&gt; Then, when you called today, Paul (whom you spoke to this time) also told
&gt; you that Mike had previously tried to contact you about it, since he saw
and
&gt; repeated to you the same documentation that I am reading now.  So before
you
&gt; sent this email, you ALREADY know that we HAD in fact tried to reach you
&gt; about this.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps you inadvertantly overlooked or erased the message on your machine
&gt; or voice mail, or if there is more than one member of your household,
&gt; perhaps someone else got it and forgot to pass it on to you.  I would also
&gt; be more than happy to confirm your phone number with you via p-mail if you
&gt; think there is any possibility that we have it wrong (although this would
be
&gt; a long shot).
&gt;
&gt; So, I do apologize for any inconvenience caused by the fact that the item
&gt; sold out.  I do understand your disappointment.  But we did attempt to
&gt; contact you about it, and in fact left you a message.
