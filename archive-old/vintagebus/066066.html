Subject: Re: [VB] Back seat discovery

Good to hear from you agian Matt, I was the one parked next to you with the
'76 yellow westy pulling a Scamp trailer.  Next summer, I hope to have
either a '63 Turkis hard top deluxe or a '64 Double Cab doing the pulling
honors.  Of course which either bus I use, it will have an upright 2 liter
for the power plant.  Out here in the Midwest as you know, the closest
campouts are at least 6-8 hours away and having the extra pulling power
makes for a much shorter trip.

Anyway, what you have is a REAL Z bed.  Most people mislable the Westy
folding bed as a Z bed, which is not correct.  Here is the site for your
bed:

Hope to see you again at a campout.  I'll be heading up to the VW Fest in
Herman about an hour west of St. Louis in a couple weeks, maybe I'll see you
there?

 
&gt; So this is neat; I didn't even know my Bus had this!  The JRMC would have
&gt; been more comfortable if I knew.  :)  My question is, what do I have?  Is
&gt; this in the direction of a Westy &quot;Z bed&quot;, or does it sound like something
&gt; else?  I have found a few pictures of SO-34 Westy interiors with the Z-bed
&gt; deployed and it looks like what I have, but I'm not sure if I have the
&gt; real Westy part or some aftermarket copy.  I will have pictures in a couple
&gt; of days if that will help identify it.
