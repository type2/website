Subject: Re: [VB] No start not ground related, fuel pump... won't

This is going to sound really stupid, but I have more than once put the hoses
on the fuel pump backwards!  The pump is trying to pull gas from the carb and
push it to the tank.  Don't work too well huh?  Anyway I usually figure it out
after a bunch of cus'n and a bid doh!

Check it out before you go pulling the pump or buying a new battery.

&gt; I am not sure if I am not getting a fast enough, long enough spin out of my
&gt; aged battery, or if the engine builder got a defective pump, or no rod! No
&gt; fuel at all to carb, I have got several starting revolutions, seems I should
&gt; have gas by now. Is there an RPM min to get the pump to go? I tried priming
&gt; with a syringe, no luck, this thing didn't even get the air out of the lower
&gt; supply line, came out when I pulled to check for gas from tank. Any
&gt; suggestions before I buy a new pump and rod and go in there?
