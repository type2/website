 I'm not sure where people get the idea that the 34 PICT-3 is a POS carb.
 I'm also no engine guru, but I find it amusing all the people who advocate
 the use of the adpater plate and a little SP carb over properly tuning the
 34, but I digress. &gt;&gt;

I get the idea from them not being conducive to cleaning out.  If you have 
one that works, great. They work well when they work.  When they don't, it is 
another story. But my experience is that often the idle or accerator systems 
are clogged, so it will do one and not the other.    It is possible to keep 
it going by tapping the pedal when you stop, but Not so great really.  
Changing the timing does not affect this.  Soaking and spraying often do not 
help, like they do with a clogged SP carb.  I have no clue why.  It's easier 
to put a SP carb on that works, as I am not concerned with having a 34 pict.  
You are welcome to rebuild one of the 34s I have that is clogged, and prove 
me wrong.  I would like to know a way to get them to clean properly.
