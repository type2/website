I scored a good copy of a February 1974 hotVW mag. at the local swap fest
yesterday.  In the beginning comments, they talk about the nasty fuel and
paper shortage and that is why &quot;this&quot; issue is printed on such inferior
paper.  The mag is in good shape and I paid for it what it sold for new back
them - one dollar!

They have a section on replacement hood kits for the beetles including a
homemade one that features the likeness of breasts.  Hmmm...

Anyway, there is an article reprinted from the Muir guide as well as one
dealing with the factory production in Puebla, Mexico.  The average age of
the workers was 21 and it shows them putting VW Things together.  The
article goes on to say that Things originally came with reduction boxes but
were replaced with IRS suspensions later on.

My question is this:  Does anyone know what the gearing on Things was and
how it compared to the last year of the reduction boxes on 1967 buses?  Any
increase in the ratios?

All fer now...
