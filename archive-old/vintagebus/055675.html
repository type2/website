Subject: Re: [VB] Bye Friends!(long)

Now this just plain sucks,

I too have been on list list for 3 or 4 yrs. too.  VWHoward turned me on to it after buying my first bus from him.
I have made may good friends and met many good people because of this list.  It's kinda like a family to me.  i know I don't post much and lurk more than anything but I read the list everyday.  The list has taken quite a downturn well before 9/11.  It just doesn't perk me up to read this list as much lately.  
It really sucks to see people like Scott leaving because of this off-topic crap.  I have followed his DC since day one....hoping to go typeIV one day.

I know I too would hate to leave the list, cause basically, it has become a part of my day...hell, life even.  

Let's all just get back to the buses and stress that our new listees read the FAQ's and charter.  Stress the importance of the archives too, mucho mucho good stuff in there.  They're there for a reason.  I don't want to see any of these guys leave.  Everyone relax, have a beer and let this crap blow over.

Hell, I think I only saw a couple of Jerome reports!

Let's get back to buses and move on.  I hope Scott, rethinks before leaving, and anyone else thinking about leaving.  This list is a great thing...I have have seen it, and I know alot of you have too.

Lately it seems like I meet a new listee at every show I go to.  I hope to make a lot more new friends in addition to the ones I have due to this list.

Sorry guys, i think I'll go and cry in my pillow now....

In a message dated Sat, 29 Sep 2001  1:37:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Scott Fraser &lt;kn6f_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt; writes:&gt; The signal to noise ratio on the list has reduced to the point where I
&gt; will say my goodbyes for now.  It will be four years in Nov that I
&gt; started lurking on the list in anticipation of buying my first bus.  I
&gt; was specifically searching for a DC.  The list has served me quite well
&gt; during that time and I hope that I have contributed in kind.
&gt; 
&gt; I first thought that much of the current trouble was due to the events
&gt; that occured on my 44th birthday which will forever live in infamy, but
&gt; a search of my local archives back to 05/01/01 show that the barbs,
&gt; flames, name calling started well before that.  Those that are in the
&gt; process of throwing barbs and using 9/11 as an excuse are exposed by
&gt; seeing what they were up to before the 11th.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm getting pmails from those wishing to continue their diatribes
&gt; but have been pushed off the list.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll happily correspond to those who may have questions about my DC and
&gt; what lies benieth it,
&gt; 
&gt; I understand why the rules are as they are on this list.  Friday's
&gt; flexible envelope gets pushed beyond recognition sometime, but the list
&gt; has always kept working.  Free speech advocates, there are upteen places
&gt; on the internet where you can go to vent your anger, frustrations.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, to my friends that have helped me so well, its been fun and
&gt; THANK YOU, see you on pmail.
&gt; 
&gt; My best wishes and regards to all,
&gt; 
&gt; Scott
&gt; '60 DC w/2L Type IV
