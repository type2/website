&gt;  Dear list
&gt;  I have a 67 single-cab .
&gt;  
&gt;  1) are my final ratios 0.82 / 4.37 / 1.26 ??
==========
I believe those would be what it came with. - no I think 67s came with a 4.12 
r/p. However,  In the past 30+ years odds are the tranny has been out at some 
time, so there is no guarantee that is what you presently have.    If you 
have big nuts (46mm) on the rear drums, it has a 99.9% chance of 1.26 
reduction, if 36mm nuts 95% chance of 1.36 reduction.   There is a website 
tells you how to jack up one wheel, mark a chalk line on the tire, tunr the 
motor  and fuigure the gearing from the ratio engine turns to wheel turns.   
there is also loads in the archives on gear ratios.

fwiw, the tranny that was in my 65 westy when I bought it was a 4.12 r/p with 
.82 4th and 1.26s- probably someone swapped the center section out of a bug, 
flipping the r/p.
..........
&gt;  2) If so I am planing to swap 4.125 , my current engine is a 1.6 single 
will 
&gt;  it result worse ? I am not planing to load anything heavier than 500 kg 
&gt;  (1100 pounds).
---------------
depends on what size tires you have.  If you have 14&quot;, the 4.12/.82/1.26 
combo should be fine with a 1600.  It might lag if you use 15&quot; rims.  (any 
comments?)

&gt;  3) Did anyone try an external oil cooler adapter which mounts under the 
&gt;  original oilcooler ?. If so does it serially add the external cooler after 
&gt;  the original one or before it ?
------------
never tried it, no clue
...................
&gt;  4) The oil-temp seems to increase easly over 120 C ( 250 F) I am not 
feeling  
&gt;  happy with it , is it normal ?
------------
no, it is not normal.   Under what conditions does it do this?  driving 
around town in regular stop/go/turn situartions?  If so double check all your 
fresh air tubes are hooked up properly etc, no rag in fan etc.   or on the 
freeway?  ANd what speeds/rpms do you drive on the freeway?    Seems that 
around 2600-2800 rpms is the best cooling speed.  2500 you run hotter.  3K 
you  run hotter.  3500 you run hotter.   4K you run hotter.  You may want to 
find out with a tach what you speeds are at 1500, 2500, 3k, 3500 in each 
gear.  You dont have to install it permantly, just hook it up and drive with 
it on the seat and a pad and paper maybe a friend to write it down.  Putting 
a external cooler may be a bandaid

&gt;  5) Can 0.82 4th gear be fitted to a bug ? my bug has 0.92 with 3.88 , 0.82 
&gt;  can be cool with 1776 , 100 hp .
yes, you can fit a .82 4th in a bug.  and a .89 in a bus.  the center section 
is the same for swing axle bus or bug- your bus has bug part number on it.  a 
3.88 tends to be in a 72 and a half and later super beetle, which has a 
single side cover, not two like the earlier cases.  takes some mods to swap 
parts over, but it can be done-   people do get 3.88 r/ps in their splitty 
bus trannies for higher speeds (though the higher gearing will make a stock 
1600 feel tired.
