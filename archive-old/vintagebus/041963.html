&gt; hi guys and Clara,
&gt; I have a question for everyone.  Last week I had my bus on ebay that
&gt; sucessfully reached the reserve and the high bidder said that I
&gt; misrepresented my ad
&gt; 
&gt;     my question for everyone is this.  After reading the ad  would you
&gt; assume that the bus is running?

&quot;1600DP motor complete not installed condition unknown.&quot; kind of says it
all!
