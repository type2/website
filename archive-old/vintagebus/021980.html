&lt;&lt; For instance, I have a 1955 westfalia.  But is it
 really a westfalia?  Doesn't have much, if any, of the
 real westfalia stuff, so in cold brutal honesty it's
 a 1955 kombi with a hatch on top.  I've even considered
 welding up the hatch and making it into a kombi if
 I can't find any of the westy stuff. &gt;&gt;

Ahhhhh!!! Don't do that. That is almost as bad as cutting a sunroof in. Lets
say you get the thing painted, why can't you look for the westy stuff down the
road? There isn't that many early westys around, and you wanna delete the
proof on the roof on that one? I would go ahead and do the important stuff
first, rust, mechanicals, and then find the interior. If my aunt had a ----,
would she be my uncle?
