Subject: side spotlight score

A buddy of mine called me up today to go check out a lead on some old VW's.

The story was that his buddy had an old neighbor who died many years 
ago. His daughter came down and wants to sell the old family farm. 
She talked to them and worked a deal that if they'd clean off the 
property, they could keep what they wanted and sell the rest. So he 
called us to go look at a couple of weird VW's on the property.

We got there and immediatly looked for the VW's. They turned out only 
to be a 411 and a '69 fastback. Darn.

But we started going through the many buildings and barns on the 
farm. We found all kinds of vintage stuff and antiques. Old gas pump, 
old bottle Coke machine, 5 ft. pepsi clock, hand worked drill press, 
vintage champion spark plug checker, a vintage Lincoln welding/tool 
cart, and tons and tons of NOS auto parts...like glass taillights for 
american cars galor!

  I could go on and on and on about it all...but the main thing was 
there wasn't anything &quot;VW&quot; there other than the 2 cars.

I did however grab an old side spotlight to put on my '59 truck. The 
guy told me to just take it, but I gave him $20 anyway....just the 
way I am. It was still an incredible deal.

I'm thinking about going back and getting the set of NOS bias tires 
with 3 inch whitewalls...and probably the Lincoln cart as well.

It was tons of fun. Here's some pictures of the spotlight. Sorry 
about the long link...you might have to cut and paste a little:
