&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; A buddy of mine is in serious need of an A/C system for a '72 bus.  Can
&gt; anyone direct me/him to a seller of A/C kits?

Here is an email response from a company who is manufacturing a completely
NEW system that is OVER TWICE as powerful as the original!!

ON OUR A/C UNITS, THEY ARE BUILT WITH 2 EVAP. ASSEMBLES EACH HAVING 16,000
BTU EACH. WE USE A ROTOR SANDEN 508 COMPRESSOR, THAT ONLY PULLS 1 1/2
HORSEPOWER OF THE MOTOR. THE FACTORY COMPRESSOR PULLED 12 HORSEPOWER.
THE FACTORY EVAP. WAS 12,000 BTU SYSTEM, THAT IS WHY THEY WOULD NOT COOL
DOWN THE VW BUS. THE COST OF THE COMPLETE SYSTEM IS $1,800.00 THE SAME COST
VW DEALER CHARGE BACK IN 1973,  1963 STARTED MY TRAINING WITH VW OF AMERICA,
AND  WAS THE A/C MAN FOR 20 YEARS, THEN I STARTED MY OWN COMPANY.
IF I CAN BE OF ANYMORE HELP PLEASE CALL ME AT 972-771-3791.
