Subject: Wanted - more BBB pix
Date: Sun, 28 Jan 2001 18:44:36 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I know I wasn't the only one with a digital camera at BBB V.  I would like
any of you who took photos at the event to email them to me at
silent_at_beatricene_dot_com so I can get a comprehensive gallery that really
encompasses the event.  Please email them to me a few at a time and try to
scale the bitplanes back if possible.   Also, I can just go to URL's and and
save pix from there if anyone has set up there own website.

Thanks!

NQ
