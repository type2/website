&lt;&lt; My steering box leaks a tiny bit in my Kombi from the seal around the lever
 shaft (the shaft that connects from the box to the pitman and then the
 drag link).  A local shop mentioned that when that happens, they usually
 fill the steering box with wheel bearing grease instead of tranny fluid,
 instead of replacing the seal.  This is assuming the steering box is not in
 need of a rebuild.

Hi Everett,
Well if it is just a small leak then top off the box every 3,000 miles instead
of 6,000 miles.  VW started to use the grease instead of the same oil as the
tranny in the mid to late 1960s.  We never liked the grease due to the fact
that the metal shavings end up not dropping into the bottom of the steering
box.  We like to drain the bus steering box every 30,000 miles by loosening
the four bolts on the bottom plate and out comes the old oil.  Make sure that
there is nothing between the sealing surfaces except the paper gasket and
retighten the four bolts.  Then refill the steering box.  If your steering box
leak gets worse you might want to look into replacing the seal.  If there is
any noticable back forth movement in the pitman arm axis that would cause the
seal to leak then you will have to rebuild you steering box.   Eric &amp; Barb
