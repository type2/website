YES!    

Old locksmiths are very cool.   I got new keys cut for my 65 when I got it 
(came w/o keys) both for the doors and the steering lock, which has a different 
key, that is unique to 55-66 steering locks.   

I go and get keys cut to code there for $15 the pair plus tax.

&gt; Hello Everyone

&gt;     I learned a little bit today that if you need a key go find the
&gt; oldest locksmith in town and they will be able to help you out.
