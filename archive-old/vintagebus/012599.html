First off, is it just me, or is there a fundamental difference
between Arizonans and Californians, in that Californians don't
post 5 times a day about a show coming up in 2 weeks....

Anyway, the weather is looking pretty crappy for this weekend:

I guess that's another fundamental difference between California
and Arizona...

The '55 westy leaks like a seive; not sure I want to take it if
it's raining...
