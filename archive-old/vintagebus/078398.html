Subject: Re: PLF Dawn's Reduction Box (longish)

&gt;
&gt;On the way to OCTO, PLF Dawn's reduction box cracked. [...] So my
&gt;question is: if this was not caused by a ball from a bearing, then what?

I'd take a WAG that one gear tooth or part of a tooth broke off and
caused mayhem.  Maybe even a small part of the inside of the housing
broke off, but probably a gear tooth.

(I just pulled a transmission out of a '96 S-z-ki truck, 127k miles, and
it had gear teeth bits in the oil - I think that's what happened to it.
Nothing came through the side, but it just got noisy as hell.  I am going
to take it apart and see.)
