Yesterday I yoinked the gas tank out of the 66 and did the old chain on a
wire trick.  I'm sure I pissed off a few neighbors with my wild thrashing of
the tank and the loud noise it produced.  Anyway, after a few blasts with
the powerwasher inside and out, I felt I had the tank cleaned out well
enough that I wouldn't be sucking mouse turds into my carbs.

By day's end, I worked it over with the wire wheel in the drill and
slathered on a liberal amount of POR15.  It wasn't until I sat on the john
and started reading some chioce vw mags from months gone by, that I
realized, &quot;Hey, I don't have a sending unit.&quot;  I've got a fuel guage in the
dash but why don't I have a hole in the top of the tank?  Was this an option
in 66?  I wonder if I can do the modification and add a sending unit because
I'll be damned if I'm going to drive around blindly with no idea what my
fuel level is.  I thought maybe I would have a reserve tap somewhere if
someone adapted an earlier tank but I don't even have this.  Nothing more
than a tank, fuel filling tube, cap, and a spiggot to let the fuel out.

What gives?  What can I do?  (seriously)  Have any of you encountered this
on an old bus tank before?  Is this aftermarket b.s.?  If I can add a
sender, is there anyone out there who would like to sell me a 67 sending
unit and guage?  Thanks again for the help!
