greetings,
i used to own a '63 single cab and the rear gate had 2 holes in it so
that when the gate was dropped, you could still see the tail lights. it
looked stock, but i've yet to see that type of gate again. did i have
something ultra rare or just a good hack job?
any info would be appreciated. i no longer have the pickup, but have
wondered this for some time now.
thanks
