&lt;&lt; Well i will open this up with a question of length on splitty roof
racks--they do come in many sizes---from 1/4--1/2--3/4--and &quot;full&quot; length &gt;&gt;

Actually 1/4-1/3-1/2-2/3-3/4-Full ...and probably some 1/8 and 1/16 sizes in
there too.  8-)

&lt;&lt; --so my question is--what is the &quot;correct&quot; length of a Full Length metal
roof rack for a splitty bus that was made by VW? &gt;&gt;

There were LOTS fabricators of the roof racks for both Bus and Beetle when you
figure in all the aftermarket folks.  I don't think anyone could come up with
a figure for &quot;full length&quot; and have it be correct.
