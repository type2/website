Was writ:
&gt;&gt; Is the crash that Ronnie predicted happening yet? &gt; crash?? what crash? I
don't think &quot;they&quot; will alow that...... as long as MR. Greenspan is alive
and well.....lol &lt;

This &quot;recession&quot; talk is a bunch of hoo-haa!  I think it is all hype from
the press and big business lets it happen so that no one gets a decent raise
this year...  Except for the airline pilots, who already make multiple times
over what normal people make. Crazy!  I do not consider pilots blue collar
workers, why the union?

Anyway there is no way that consumer spending can go UP in Q1 of 2001 by
either 0.2% or 2% and the economy be is such a &quot;poor&quot; position.  Interest
rates are still crazy low so money is cheap, where is the problem?  I love
how before the investment &quot;professionals&quot; would blab about how the stock
market had already taken into account future changes in the interest
rates... BS!  The stock market corrected itself and people are whining, that
is all.  Look at the P/E ratios of companies and they are sane again, I look
for P/Es of under 60...  A stock with a 300 P/E ratio is waaaay overvalued
and going to be unstable and eventually tank big.

People who have had their 401K and personal portfolio go down the toilet
want answers.... No mater how lame the replies from &quot;professional&quot; market
analysts.  I love the BS quarterly letters I get from Smith-Barney, good for
toilet paper after a lively constitutional I suppose :)

All the people I know who were laid off have had zero problem finding new
jobs.  90% of the shake up has been unprofitable dotcoms who have been
poorly managed or just not a great idea.  Pure Darwinism.

On a bus note I am supporting the economy trying to get some stock valves
and roller-ball adjusters....  Long story, but will have the detailed
complaining on Wednesday...  When the new parts come into my FLAPS.

Hey its Friday!!!!  Woo Hoo!
