 &lt;&lt; I have a 65 deluxe...  I am having trouble with 
  the front cargo doors bottom hinge, it just wont break loose. &gt;&gt;
             
Dave (and the List):

First, go take off your right front wheel....  Now go find yourself a rivet
gun.  (Trust me.  I'll pull it together in Chapter Three.)

Have you tried Kroil?  And on the BACK of the hinge?  (Kroil is a super
penetrant, more effective than Liquid Wrench.)

The threads of the hinge-screws extend through the backing plate.  They
accumulate rust which not only welds them in place but makes them extremely
difficult to unthread. 

To gain access to the back of the hinge-plate you will need to drill a couple
of 1/8&quot; dia. holes.  Locate them as accurately as you can and err on the high
side rather than too low.  The upper hole should fall about in the middle of
the welded flange of the box-section at the rear of the right-front wheel
arch.  You'll see what I mean once you get your head under there, assuming
you've scrubed off the crud. 

It's easier if you remove the wheel.

Use the nozzle-tube to get the Kroil onto the threads.  

Got your rivet gun?  Good.  Put a dull-pointy-tool into the gun.  (I use an
old 3/32 rivet set, polished down so it won't bugger up the screw.)  Press the
point of the tool into the bottom of the Phillip's head screw and give it a
burp.  

Now you can unscrew it.  It will be tight but not frozen.  Work it back and
forth a fraction of a turn at a time to polish the rust off the threads.

Didn't work?  Wait a while and give it another burp.  No torque and no heavy
pressure, you want the vibration rather the force.  Burp.  The screw moves.
It can't help it -- Laws of Physics and all that.  And it moves at a slightly
different rate than the hinge or the threaded plate.  You can't see the
difference but the molecules of Kroil can.  Every time you give the screw-head
a burp, it is the Big One as far as the Kroil is concerned.  And it will flow
into the fissures opened by the burping earthquake (or screw-quake.  One of
those).

Kroil.  Burp.  Unscrew the damn thing and get on with the job.  (And don't
forget to put the wheel back on :-)

But about those holes you just drilled....

Before drilling the holes it would be wise to scrub down the area.  Get it
really clean.  (It helps if you take the wheel off first.)  After you get the
door off, the first thing you want to do is to soak a Q-tip with Rustoleum and
dob it on the raw metal where you drilled the holes.  Let it dry and then seal
the holes with seam-sealer.  Now it won't rust.  But the holes will still be
there should you need them again.

(No Kroil?  No rivet gun?  Well.... you may still be able to the screws to
loosen up if you can get at the back of the hinge to soak it with penetrating
oil... most of which will just run off.  To see the thing come off like magic
you really need to squirt it WHILE vibrating it with the rivet gun....  but
tapping on it for half an hour with a small hammer will usually produce the
same results.   Small means small, by the way.  Like a six-ounce ball-peen
swung only with the fingers &amp; wrist.... You aren't hammering as such, you're
setting up a vibration.  And before you discount the effectiveness of
vibration, that's how you drive a 40-foot concrete piling into frozen
tundra... using the vibration from a 1/4hp motor mounted on the top of the
piling. The 'vibrator' is a piece of bar-stock about two inches long mounted
asymmetrically on the motor's shaft.  Just plug it in and go home, leaving a
crew to maintain tension on the guy-wires.  All that vibration won't do the
motor much good but the piling will be at grade-level when you show up the
next day.  And motors are cheaper than pile-drivers.)

-Bob Hoover

PS -- Having drilled a couple of holes, you may wish to drill a couple more.
You can keep the backing-plate from dropping down inside the door by catching
it from behind, using one of the holes you've just drilled or a third hole in
between them.  A nail ground off flat will work.  Ditto for stiff safety wire,
welding rod, a coat-hanger...
