Subject: ISO: mag. article + other bits o' info

Hey all-
Well, I was just talking over insurance w/ my ins.co. and they seem to
think insuring my '67 Deluxe for $5K is off the mark. I didn't bring
them a copy of it's last appraisal because it was done 3yrs ago &amp; I only
have a copy so the photos are totally useless... but it does refer
specifically to my bus, and you can tell- I'll try using it anyway.  

But my quesstion is: I remember a thread awhile ago about a magazine
article that named values for restored Deluxes - collectability &amp; such-
does anyone remember the article, what car mag? I'd appreciate it.

Other topic: Stories &amp; Finding posts
- LOVE 'EM!! -
Besides the high E.V.(entertainment value) scores, the added helpful
hints are always good. Nothing like having a stored memory of someone
else's experience to make a daunting situation a bit easier...though
that old story about using a cut up pair of pantyhose for a fan belt
*still* is far-fetched to me :) I got hooked w/ Charlie Ford's ramblings
and kick myself for not making a mental note to save those... It was a
fine travel-log - even if low on helpful mechanical hints :)
