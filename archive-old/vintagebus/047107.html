Hey list----
From what I've heard, The Gene Berg balanced degree pulley is the  best way  
to go if you've got the cash... 
(otherwise stock is always good!)
My good buddy Neil has one and the word is they are VERY accurate,but, boy 
are they expensive _at_ around 100$ a pop...
I think a few DBG guys use them also, and are happy w/ them. Those guys 
really drive their busses as do many of the list members! Doesn't Brian have 
one on his immaculate westy DBG'ers?
Where did you get the EMPI pulley Isaiah? Is it balanced?
Just a new dimension--
Pete
