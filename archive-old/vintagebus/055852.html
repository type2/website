	I would just pull the ignition switch and rearrange the tumblers
to a VW key if you have one of that time frame. I did that with my 67
bus and I will do that to my 65 as well.

the drivers exterior door handle,Find a competent locksmith and have a

Subject: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus


The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a
VERY long time.  So it goes to figure that the ignition key is missing
in action.  I will eventually get around to getting either a new key or
a new switch, but I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if
the current engine appears salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone
could tell me how to hot wire start thie bus.  I assume you can jump a
wire between between the battery and starter some how, but does anyone
know specificaly how to do this? Maybe some of you California guys have
done this before! Just Kidding ;^)
