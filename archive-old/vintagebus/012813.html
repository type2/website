I once drove my 1961 rust top (I mean rag top) standard from Vegas to Phoenix with no clutch and no generator.  I stopped half way to charge the battery after driving with the headlight on for a couple hours.  Starting it in gear with no charging system got scarier the lower the battery got, but I made it home fine.  The worse part was in Sun City (a retirement area where everyone drives golf carts) where everyone seemed to be stopped at green lights when I was trying to keep moving.  Once I made it through there the rest of town was cake.

Driving without a cluch is definitely a skill every bus owner should have.  You never know when you will need to get to work on a holiday weekend when no parts stores are open or the part isn't available.

Hi Zac,
Whoa, stop the presses!  First get out the Idiot's manual by John Muir and
read on how to drive without a clutch.  Yes, you could just tow it, but this
is the best time to learn so you do not have to later abandon your bus
sometime just because the clutch goes.
