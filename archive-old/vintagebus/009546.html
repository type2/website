&gt;a) good price?
&gt;b) enough for basic things? (air-tools and bit of painting?) no
&gt;sandblasting.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Andre


I don't agree with the slam of the oil less compressor. However as with any
other subject, you must know your limitations. I'm a contractor and have
three oil less compressors that I use all of the time, some times even
continuously for weeks. They live well enough for me but this is just for
shooting nails. I would not ask them to do any thing else. At home, just
like Thom, I have a 5 H.P. 80 gallon unit that will almost keep up with sand
blasting and my IR 1/2&quot; drill. No problem with impact wrenches, air hammers,
crimpers, shears, or sanders.

Save your pennies Andre, you'll be glad you did.
