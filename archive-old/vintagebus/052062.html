I am in need of a fuse block for my '59, it is supposed to be the 6 fuse =
type. Does anybody have one they want to sell?  While searching the archi=
ves I came across some information about emergency brake cable problems w=
ith the big nut trans. in an early bus. What is the problem and does anyb=
ody have a good solution- I need to buy cables for my bus. Thanks.
