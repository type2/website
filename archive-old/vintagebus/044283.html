&lt;&lt;  I was planning to get some bondo fill it in and sand then paint it up.  
Would this be a waste of time? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Using bondo just will start to recrack open about 6 months later.  Best to 
use epoxy which you can get from Eastwood and you can get an instruction book 
on steering wheel repair there also.    Eric&amp;Barb
