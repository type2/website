Subject: Re: [VB] door seals

There's no secret; when you've got them scrunched up fairly well, and
they're still long, then cut them to length. That's my policy, and it's
worked well. Others may have different suggestions...

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; I am putting in new seals on my doors, cargo doors, and engine lid, and the

&gt; they shrink later, which makes sense,  but I just can't seem to squeeze them
&gt; together enough to fit them in at their present length. Is there some secret
&gt; to this?
