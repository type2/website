Hello to the group. I am a new subscriber here and just wanted to introduce
myself. The bus and I live in Weston, Missouri. Its a very nice 1966 Micro
bus and there are lots of photos at http://home.att_dot_net./~Clalb2
I am currently in the begining stage of installing a brand new brake system,
I have some plans to install a new trany and engine, stock, and to get the
front end re-built or replaced. Its been a labor of love for me to work on
the bus. I am looking forward to learning here and maybe sharing what I know
with the group about getting one of these type 2's back in shape.
Hope you all have a nice day.
Clancy
