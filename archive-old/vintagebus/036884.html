&lt;&lt; Also I have a spare tranny from a 70 I got...these are
 swappable correct?... &gt;&gt;

Pretty much any 002 (1968-1975) is interchangeable.  
There are some minor differences but nothing really 
enough to cause problems.  Just make sure the T/O
bearing clutch arm is the one you need for the 
clutch style your using.

As a side note.  The 1968's are a one year only style.
They had a very poor ring and pinion design originally
and the pinion bearing is a one year only as well.
Whenever I get one of these in for overhaul the 
customer pays the core charge and gets a '69 or 
'70 back.  Its cheaper than trying to locate a NLA 
one year only pinion bearing and the R/P set is a 
much stronger 8 tooth version (5.38 or 5.42) than 
the '68 only 7 tooth.

Interestingly enough VW went with a 6 tooth 4.83 set
in the later 091-1 Waterboxer transaxles as a replace-
ment for the 7 tooth 4.86s.  For street use the 4.83 
set is  just fine but for racing I use the earlier 4.86 
version.

Good luck with that 28 year old transaxle!  When it,
too, gives up the ghost send me an email!!
