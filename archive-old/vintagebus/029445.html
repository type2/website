Subject: vent wings

After 28 years of VW ownership, { 61 ragtop, 63 convertible, 67 bug, 69
bug }I have finally purchased a bus. Don't know what took me so long.
But in those years, I've never had a problem with vent wings. Untill
now. My recent aquisition, a 67 model 221 has a broken latch on the
passenger's side and a broken lower post on the driver's side vent
wings. I have heard that the glass to frame seal is difficult to
replace. Does'nt look that hard to me with the proper tools and a little
common sense for pressing the glass into the frame, However, the broken
lower post, with the spring tensioner, is another matter. Is it as
simple as welding another threaded rod to the frame? Any suggestions on
either problem would be appreciated.
Thanks,
John
