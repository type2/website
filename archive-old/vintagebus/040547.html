I’m new to the list. I have a ‘67 Deluxe (13-window, sea blue/cloud white) 
that I purchased in California about four years ago.  From May to October it 
is my daily driver. I recently purchased a ’72 Westfalia to be a winter 
driver but have yet to get it running.

I seem to be going through speedo cables a little too quickly. The first 
one, I believe it may have been the original, wore out (the square that fits 
through the dust cap became rounded) last August. I replaced it with a 
Brazilian one. After about 2000km, the new one broke two weeks ago. The 
cable broke about a quarter inch from the end that fits through the dust 
cap. I replaced it again, with the same brand cable – from California 
Imports, if that makes a difference. This time I made it just 20km before 
the square end that fits through the dust cap came off the cable – the cable 
didn’t break/twist/wear, the end just came off, like it wasn’t crimped on 
very well.

Did I just get a bum replacement cable or should I be looking to the 
speedometer as the guilty party? Is the speedo something I should be messing 
with? I’m tempted to reshape the end on the original cable and try using it 
again.

Any suggestions for troubleshooting the speedo would be appreciated.
