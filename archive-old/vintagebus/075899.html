Subject: blown fuses

Hi after changing the carb on my 67 deluxe I decided to go on a test run.
About a mile and a half later the bus cuts out back fires warning lights
come on
as I coast to a halt. Ah I think a blown fuse, replace fuse check wiring for
anything obvious try to restart engine fuse blows, start disconnecting wires
from radio electric cool box, replace fuse turn engine over fuse blows,
remove
kick panel check fuse remove fuse holder replace fuse get underneath van
short
across starter motor to spin engine fuse blows, remove ignition switch
change
fuse turn over engine fuse blows, I have now run out of fuses walk to
friends
place and get tow home. The engine starts but as soon as it does it blows
the
main 16amp fuse on the right hand side. Tomorrow I will have to put it right
any body got any ideas its a 1600 twin port fitted with petronix electronic
ignition. If not can I run the engine with the dynamo disconected will it
harm
it? I know the dynamo shouldn't have anything to do with the fuse system but
the
fuse seems to blow just as the engine starts. I guess it a good time to
replace the fuse holder with one I soldered earlier!  HELP Mike
