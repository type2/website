&lt;&lt;Small ass world. Clayton is my next town over. I'm from Concord, and now
officially reside in Martinez. Even smaller world is that I also have a 1963
deluxe 15 window that I purchased under 6 years ago.&gt;&gt;

I have a '61 15 window DeLuxe.  I live in Napa, CA for two more months.  Is
yours the M code &quot;no windows or skylights&quot; or is yours the model that didn't
come with one at all.  Any thoughts, anyone?

I haven't found many that are this spec.  Anyone have one of those?  (M
coded 15 window)
