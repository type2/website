Jason,

Jason, fight the reaper bro, don't let the man get you down.  I find
that
happens quite often, not with Taxis cabs, but with everyday people. 
Cruising
down the freeway at a steady 55-60 in the slow lane, I look in the
mirror,
and there they are for miles and miles, just sitting behind me as
content as
can be.  It amazes me, how there is nobody in any of the other lanes and
they
still just sit there rolling along like the days of old when everybody
cruised at those speeds.

Later,
Aaron

&gt; I kept checking the rear-view for angry yuppies
&gt; (although at 6:30 am they're not even at Starbuck's
&gt; yet). Then I suddenly noticed a taxi driving behind me
&gt; (for those of you who don't live in L.A. there are no
&gt; taxis driving around waiting for fares. You have to
&gt; call them for a pick-up and a ride.) Anyway, here's
&gt; this driver with an empty taxi following me, going 50
&gt; mph for several miles.
&gt;
&gt; Then I got to thinking: &quot;Is he waiting for me to break
&gt; down?&quot; Like he knows I'm a potential fare? Tailing me
&gt; the way vultures circle above an injured wildebeast on
&gt; the Serengetti?
&gt;
&gt; Brutal.
&gt;
&gt; Finally he pulled off, but the whole time I was
&gt; thinking like &quot;oh, you're not getting me, bastard!
&gt; Today is NOT my day.&quot; Like he was the freakin' grim
&gt; reaper or something.
