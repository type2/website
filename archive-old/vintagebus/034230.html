I have installed the type 1 and 3 masters in buses, but have not been very
happy with the end result. The problem I have had is a spongy pedal, the
brakes work excellent and haven't seen any failures in over 3 years, but
some people can't live with the spongy pedal, this was not done by my
recommendation, but done at the owners request, if you want safer braking
install the duel circuit 67 only bus master, is your life worth the 150
dollars that I sell them for?

&gt;Hi , I am in need of a complete, good used wiring harness. Any leads or 
&gt;hints greatly appreciated.
&gt;Also has anyone replaced the single type 2 master brake cylinder with a 
&gt;larger dual circuit type 3 one? Or have any recommendations to upgrade 
&gt;this?
&gt;

Thanks Trevor
