I've been trying to catch up on the list mail, and
have been reading some of the comments about sales
tax.
I'm not sure exactly what the case is in all states,
but in Wisconsin, you do not have to pay sales tax on
items purchased by mail, phone,etc., from out of state
vendors if they do not have  a business location in
Wisconsin.  For example, if I order something from
Ronnie in Arizona, he doesn't charge me sales tax. 
However--I am liable for &quot;use tax&quot; payable to
Wisconsin in the amount equal to Wisconsin sales tax,
if it is a taxable item.  
My wife, who was an income tax professional for 18+
years, always insists that we pay the &quot;use tax&quot; at the
end of the year on our Wis incometax forms, as she was
beginning to see the Wis IRS checking into this and
penalizing some people for non-payment of the &quot;use
tax&quot; on out of state purchases.
Someone mentioned that they were in a state that
didn't hae a sales tax, and shouldn't hae to pay sales
tax in other states.  Not true, if you are physically
in the other state buying the item, rather than doing
it mail order, etc., you need to pay the sales tax.  
Regarding online sellers not having collect sales tax,
this is complicated and difficult to find accurate
sources about due to all the rumours and false info
out there on the subject.
