Subject: marantz 4 track player
Message-ID: &lt;t968776358c10_at_d701302117.iopener_dot_net&gt;

early to mid 60's marantz made a 4 track tape player. the 4 track tapes had very few songs on them, probably only 3 to 4. most of the players were the type that you sat the tape on the player, you pulled a lever and it engaged the tape against the mechanizim that played the tape. as things progressed they came out with a player that would play 4 or 8 track tapes.			paul																																				    61 sc																																				morgan's point resort, texas
