Subject: 61/62 hump back seat

Over the weekend i spent some time stitching up a new
seat cover for my 61 DC.  The hump back style.  I was
able to secure an original pattern to help me do this.
 So far so good but i have a questions for anyone who
has an original one of these.

Is the center seam a single or double stitch?  

What i mean by that is did they first sew the two
pieces together with a standard 1/4&quot; seam and then
fold the seam over on the back side and again sew it
up.  I think you can tell this if the seam has a
stitch showing and it is not where the two pieces of
material come together.

I took my pattern apart and failed to note this.  It
looks like a double to me. 

anyway, i will post pictures when i get mine done.

Matthew
