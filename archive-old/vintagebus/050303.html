Subject: 68 clutch/pressure plate fit

I posted earlier this week IRT the hub on a new clutch disk  interfering
with the ring on the pressure plate.  Sachs tech support straightened me
right out on this.

There are two 200 mm clutches for the application (bus 62-71, bug 67-79).

The Sachs# AMTX 5225m  is the common one, used with a diaphragm type
pressure plate. It has a noticeable taper on the hub for about half the
lenght of it.  The Sachs guy said it goes from ~30 to ~27 mm in OD.

The Sachs # AMTX 5202m is the one for the earlier style (3 arm) pressure
plate with no center ring.   The hub is ~30mm in OD for almost the whole
length. It has just a tiny bit of taper on the very end. It will not work
right with the later, diaphragm style pressure plate.

Apparently the one I received in a Sachs clutch kit was mislabeled.  Live
and learn. Thanks for all the responses.
