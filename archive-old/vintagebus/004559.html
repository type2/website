Subject: Lens and Clock

Long time reader...first time poster!  Hope someone on this great list can
help me find for my 1970 single cab:

left front directional signal lens
clock

Naturally, I would love for the clock to be NOS but don't think that's going
to happen so just want the correct one in excellent condition for my little
truck, Maggie T.

It's really enjoyable to read everything that is submitted, and I am envious
of the knowledge that all of you have.  I'm new but eager to learn.

Thanks,
Ruth
