Here's an e-mail Eric &amp; Barb sent me when I was chasing a similar deal:
Hi Dave,
The stock bolts are N 10 119 1   Bolt, hex. head M 12X1.5X25 DIN 961 -
Spring
plate mounting from Chassis No. 20 117 902.
We really advise against using this length of bolt in this application.
During tranny installations over and over again we ended up with having
at
least one if not two of the stock bolts strip the threads out of the
reduction boxes when torqued down to stock values.  So now we drill tap
and
retap with a bottoming tap the holes and then install bolts that are
about
40% longer.  Make sure to use Grade 8 or it's Euro equivalent to make
sure
that the bolts are not too soft and stretch or too hard and shatter
under the
stress.
This ought to help!

Dave
