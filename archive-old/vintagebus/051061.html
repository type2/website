Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Troubles...HELP!!!

Jon, Have you set up a vacuum gauge? We know how much you like gauges.
Because like Ronnie we think vacuum LEAK but where?  Intake manifold sounds to
be the only thing you have not exchanged externally.
What about a High lift and over lapping cam??
What did Rachel think about -- (later i held up a white towel to the tailpipe
for about 10 minutes--came
away clean)?

&gt; idle is rough, alomst sounds like a cylinder isn't firing (they all are),
&gt; and the engine is visibly shaking (but not super bad, but noticeable to me)
&gt; at idle. runs good when first starting it and the choke is closed, but when
&gt; off the choke, it runs like crap.
