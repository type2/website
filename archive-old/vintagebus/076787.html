Casino&gt; between March 20-26th

&gt; They were right.  The Nike Mojo bus will be at Silverstone Golf Club,
form 8:00 am until 12:00 pm on Thursday, March 18th.  If you are not
familiar with Silverstone golf club, we are located in the northwest at
I-95 and Durango.  If you follow the link provided below, it will give
you exact directions.
