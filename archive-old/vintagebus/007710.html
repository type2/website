So, I finally went out and finished taking my motor apart.  It had been
sitting on blocks in the backyard since October, when I pulled the motor out
and pulled all the parts of it, then bad weather and laziness got the best
of me.  Anyway, it's been nice and sunny, so Tuesday I finally got it
stripped right down and split the case.

i'm doing the rebuild on the advice of my mechanic, who couldn't find
anything wrong with the motor after it failed emissions, and told me either
the cam was shot or lifters stuck, since #2 and #4 cylinders were not
functioning properly, but compression was good, it's about 125-130 on all 4
cylinders.  So I took it all apart and the cam is fine.  Damn.  And the
lifters aren't stuck or anything.  Oh well, i wanted to do a proper rebuild
anyway, about a year ago I put on new p &amp; c's and heads but that's all.  And
it had been overheating ever since.  I did notice this time that when I
pulled on the pulley it kinda went thunk.  As in, moved.  But the clutch and
pressure plate were off, does that matter?  And in any case, I'll be getting
new main bearings, so would that take care of the problem?

One thing I am wondering about, in the idiot book it says when you take the
distributor drive gear out that there's a spring with it.  I saw no spring.
What's the deal?

And lastly, I bought a new carb. a couple years ago.  It's some kind of
aftermarket p.o.c. It's sold as being a solex 30-pict carb but it's not, I
guess it's the next best thing.  Does anyone know what size of jet(s?) would
be good for this?  I really am clueless about this whole jet thing, I have
rebuilt a carburetor before but this part escapes me.  And I'm trying to
track down the cause of the overheating.  I think all that's left is the
distributor or a lean mixture.  But then a lean mixture wouldn't have failed
emissions, right?

Whatever, I'll figure it out when I get it back together.  Thanks for
listening to my confused ramblings.
Diana
