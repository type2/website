Hi All-


&gt;     UV  231 SK  654C    551426
&gt; 


As I recall SK stands for a &quot;Special Kolour&quot; (sic) designation from the factory. Listmember Steve Mighetto (sorry forgotten your address Steve, are you still on the list?) who has a nice quite original flip seat 62 westy also had the &quot;SK&quot; designation on the m-code tag so he may able to fill in some blanks for you.

Generally the colour code would also be listed on the headlight bucket of the pass side headlight if memory serves..

michael
