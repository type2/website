The interior I had stripped out earlier, and didn't feel like hanging the new roof panels, especially as the front one I hadn't finished. Got more of that shiny bubbled wrap insuation, and stuck more in the walls, and installed the new long panels,

What is the bubble wrap for? sound/heat insulation? 
Would that be a potential trap for moisture, if it is doubled over I mean.

I wonder if one could insulate the doors too.
Anyone have any ideas on that?
