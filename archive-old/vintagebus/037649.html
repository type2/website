Subject: Re: type 4 upright conversion 


&gt;subject says it all. I'm now torn between a 1776 or converting my 1.8 type 4 
engine to an upright. Anyone got some type 4 carbs for sale or a
conversion
fanshroud and alt.stand? Again thanks for all the great info.

FAT Performance in SOCAL makes an upright type 4 kit that includes 
everything you'll need including the carb linkage which is a little 
unique in that it has to go behind the shroud.

Be warned!  The upright kit uses a 911 fan, alternator, alternator 
ring, and airflow direction vanes.  These are not cheap!  On the other 
hand...it works GREAT.  I installed this setup on a 2.0l type 4 in my 
baja way back in 1983 using the original upright kit that came from 
Willibald Tuning in Germany.  Talk about fun ;)  I still have that 
engine sitting on the floor of my garage under a tarp.  The original 
Weber IDFs were switched out for CIS fuel injection (another Willibald 
kit) which increased performance and drive-ability another few 
notches.  Someday I'll find a new toy to put it in.

Have fun,

Jeff
