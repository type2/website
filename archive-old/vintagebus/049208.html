List:

I just came upon an original set of early Westy clam shell lights.  These are complete, bulb holders and lenses.  These are the smooth opaque lenses, not the pebbled white ones.

My bus came with a set so I don't really need another, although it would be nice to have a spare set for when one of the kids smashes one with a fishing pole or something.

If someone has something interesting that they'd like to trade I'd be up for that.  I'm at the point where I really only need cool accessories, like a black pattern gear shift knob for one.

Robert
