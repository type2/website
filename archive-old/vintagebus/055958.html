Subject: RE: [VB] door screws

Wolfsburg west or wolfgang have all that stuff... if you don't mind non-og
fasteners.


john asked:
   I was putting my passenger side door together today after painting it a
coupel of months ago when I realized i've misplaced some misc. screws. These
screws are long gone as I searched for them the rest of the night. My
questions is, where can i get these screws?
The screws in question are the 4 main screws that hold the window frame on
the door. They are 4 big machine screws with counter-sunk heads on them. I'm
also missing the little claws that hold the scraper seal metal cover on.
these are the claws that bite down in the felt. Maybe a listee out there has
a door with these parts on them they would sell me?
