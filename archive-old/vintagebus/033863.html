This weekend I decided to re-grease my sticky accelerator cable in my 67'
camper.  I pulled the cable out, straightened a few kinks and put it back
in, greasing it all the way.  The problem came when the cable came out the
end of the accelerator cable tube at the rear.  To bridge the gap from the
end of the cable tube to the tube running through the fan shroud, the cable
is exposed and it also is rubbing against the tranny.  It looks like it has
been this way for some time, as the cable has sliced a nice groove into the
tranny case.  Is there supposed to be any tube or flexible housing that runs
from the end of the accelerator cable tube to the tube that runs through the
fan shroud?  I checked the manuals and the parts guide but couldn't find
anything.  thanks...
