If y'all are like me, you're disappointed with the long term results of
&quot;Armor All&quot; type tire detailing products. It looks greasy when you put
it on, and turns brown in a few days. I was reading a magazine recently
with a story about a new Meguiar's product called Endurance that they
claim is a &quot;water resistant tire protectant&quot; and &quot;lasts for weeks, not
days and prevents tires from turning brown.&quot; Meguiar's is sending out
free samples. I ordered a sample but haven't gotten it yet so I can't
vouch for their claims, but I wanted to pass along the number: (800)
347-5700. They'll ask where you heard about the product - I saw the
story in &quot;Cars and Parts&quot; magazine.
