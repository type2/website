Subject: So. Cal bus headliner source

Can anyone in So. Cal. (or anyehere else) recomend a shop to install a
headliner and sunroof into my 65 Samba.  I know of 4 places right now
that have done this type of work:

Dave Lumetta in Burbank               ($1100)
Import Interiors in Anahiem            ($1300)
West Coast Classic in Fulerton        ($????)
Kustom 1 in Orange.                        ($????)

Anyone have any personal experiance with any of there?  What did you all
pay to get your headliners done?
Any words of advice as i look for someone to do this.

Thanks
Matthew
