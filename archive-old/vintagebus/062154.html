Hi Ronnie,
A little casting flash that does not block the fins closed might do that, but 
what we have seen is stuff completely blocking up the fins.  Mayhaps drilling 
straight down between the fins with just the right sized drill bit would 
create a corragated like surfaces which would in turn create more surface 
area and cool better.......
