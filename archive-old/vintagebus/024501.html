Hello, all...

the way
&gt; that worked for me, which you will want to try/use is to screw an
&gt; appropriate sized metric bolt into the end of the axle, one which is of
&gt; proper length to fit all the way into the axle. Use a washer as well on
&gt; it. Then, lift the axle tube assembly with your left hand, and gently pull
&gt; it towards you as you hit the bolt's head carefully with a sledgehammer (4
&gt; Lbs is fine).

Thats neat.... I used a brass punch that fit perfectly in there to do
the same thing a few days ago, learning that technique originally from
one of the transmission videos that came in the parts stash with my '65
and adapting it to my situation. I think that the bolt/washer technique
is better, though... no chance of messing up those threads on the
inside.

 This method was taught to me by jwilli (Todd) on the list
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; That will get your upper bearing off.  You will need a clamshell
&gt; attachment and puller of the correct size to do the lower outer bearing. I
&gt; tried two screwdrivers and it didn't work. It may work for you, however.
&gt; 
&gt; Be sure to wear eye protection any time you work with pullers.

	I haven't gotten there yet, though it is waiting for me to do. 
	I pulled the transmission out of a donor bus, a '64 IIRC... to put in
my '66. It worked great, except for a leak around the gasket on one of
the right side tranny cover plates. This was vexing me... and it was
time to replace the spring plates anyways (the old ones had holes
enlarged to fit larger bolts for redux boxes that had been retapped
larger, the old threads long stripped out... next time I'll try
time-sert or something else for a professional fix)...
	So I pulled the tranny out and R &amp; R'ed the spring plates, setting the
&quot;new&quot; used ones to 20 degrees, 0 minutes exactly, relative to the angle
of the frame members... with the help of that mitutoyo angle gauge from
my combination set. They are both right on spec... and I'm pleased that
it went together without too much finagling or readjustment, after a 3
or 4 AM trip to Kroger's for some talc for the rubber bushings. 
	I had a set of tranny gaskets in stock just for this kind of occasion,
and decided to start tearing down the tranny to freshen it up with new
gaskets/seals/whatever.... I hope the fishing expedition is fun and not
too expensive.
	I used to have a cheap set of tranny tools years ago, but lacking the
press and so on, and the knowledge to use the jig, I sold it to a
friend. i have since regretted this, but he has made use of it so it
isn't a bad thing. I think it was made by Crown Mfg... but I'm not sure.
As with everything else in the parts stash, I am fairly certain it was a
JC Whipme item. But... I sold the jig and that tool that is used for
exerting pressure on the pinion gear to push it and the gear
stacks-section away from the rest of the tranny. I'll improvise on the
pinion tool, but will probably need to find another jig if I discover
anything that necesitates disassembly of the gear stacks. Synchros are
the main thing, really. I personally wouldn't mind double-clutching, but
you never know who might have to drive that bus.... guess I'll whip out
that video again and watch it for the heck of it. 
	So... as it stands, the tranny is sitting out on the floor of the
garage, minus the redux boxes, axle tubes &amp; axles, crown gears &amp; fulcrum
plates, and the rest of the differential... Maybe later on tonight I'll
undo the locking tabs that keep the pinion gear nut in place, and do
something with that.... 

Have fun...
