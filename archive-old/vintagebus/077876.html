Subject: Re: [VB] It's alive! And rear wheel seals are leaking...

Having all the gaskets and seals in the correct place is a must.  We have 
found that the outer spacer for the rear wheel bearing can be so worn or pitted 
from rust as to allow the axle seal inner lip to leak.  Plus we have had 
leaking when we tried to put on this spacer first and then the seal in the bearing 
cover onto the axle.  It is too easy to not get the seal lip onto the spacer 
properly and get the lip distorted.  Works much better to slide the spacer into 
the seal and bearing cover so you can visually make sure the inner lip is in 
place properly and then slide all these pieces onto the axle shaft.  If one 
does not torque down the axle nuts on the drums the O-ring seals will leak.  Did 
you check the bore the outer part of the axle seal seats into?  If there were 
any scratches or rust/debris there it will leak.  The bore might need a 
polishing out with sandpaper and as always us a little oil in the bore before 
sliding in the seal.
