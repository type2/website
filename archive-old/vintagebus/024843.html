Hello to the list,

found out today my fuel gauge is shot on the 66 micro.  AND it was a 6
volt original!  the mech.  specified that some 6v gauges would still
work even after the 12v. conversion.  is this true?  I mean, it never
worked that well, was never properly calibrated, etc, but still
registered dutifully up until the end.  so it looks as if I'll have to
install a 67 gauge since that was the only pre-68 year for 12 v.  of
course, I'm not terribly interested in an aftermarket anything, but any
suggestions?  anyone out there got a spare 67 gauge?
