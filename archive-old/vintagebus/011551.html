&gt;Hoping to remove the cargo floor from my 21-window this weekend and would
like some wisdom. The outer supports running length-wise on the bus are
pretty rusted out. Should I plan on welding in some supports to keep the
bus from caving in under it's own weig!
ht? I may have to move this bus after I remove the cargo floor and before I
replace the cargo floor. Should I postpone this part of the project until I
have cargo floor supports?
&lt;

Whoa Joe!

        The main frame running length-wise down the center (that is *
inner* not *outer*) of the bus IS the main support of the bus....so if they
are OK then you dont need to worry about the center caving in.

          Basically, you have those two main inner braces running all the
way from torsion to torsion serving as your spine.  Then, the crossing
cargo supports are like a rib cage that are tee'd off at their ends by your
inner rocker.  These cross supports are &quot;I&quot; shaped and usually dont need to
be replaced.  The inner rocker is in a &quot;U&quot; shape with the open end out and
drain holes down.  Your outer rocker just butts up against the inner
rocker.

        Are you replacing the entire cargo floor?  You do know that you can
buy just the outer 10 inches of the floor for about $40?  The whole floor
half is like $100.  What shape are your inner/outer rockers in ($17 &amp; $34)?
 All the floors I replaced had shot rockers which makes floor removal easy
after the rocker is removed.
        
        As far as removing the floor, you will be amazed at how easy the
spot welds break loose from cross supports.  I dont know about  how
necessary the air chisel is.  I cut the entire driver side floor out of my
'64 Single Cab last night with just a hammer and chisel in about 45 mins. 
I did cut/hammer out the inner and outer rockers with a grinder first. 
Remember SAFETY GLASSES!

Happy operating Doc Joe....beep.....beep.....beep...,
