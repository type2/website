Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Dist Q

This is one of the prime examples when someone only
gives a partial number and not the complete number.
It could be a 111 905 205M like Matt says or.....
it could be a 113 905 205M!
The curve on the 113 is a lot more:

Bus &amp; Pickup 1968 * 1600 and Beetle 1968 * 1500 Man

So I took my 010 dist out and replaced it with a
vacuum advance 205M.
I set it at 7.5 BTDC with the vac hose disconnected
at 850rpm. After
I re-attach the vac line it goes up to around 10
degrees! Is that right?
 
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm#B6465 says
the 111 905 205 M is
the same as Bosch ZV/JU4R3, which means you can look
on page E-9 12 of
your '63-'67 Bentley for the advance curve in
tabular form:
 
 mm Hg        crankshaft degrees
 18.5 - 24.5  Advance begins
 29   - 38    10 degrees
 50           16 - 22 degrees (end of advance)
