Subject: bus pictures

Hey all,
Does anyone have any pictures of a NICE turquoise bus?  If any of you
own one, in any shape, let me know.  I'm looking for pictures of a white
over turquoise standard...  That and pictures of an all turquoise
interior.  The bus can be original or restored...  I've searched
thesamba and vintagebus and came up with only 1 or 2 pics.  Turquoise
was a 2 year only color correct? 62 and 63?  I'd like to see pics of a
62...but there really isn't THAT big of a difference between the
years...just mainly the front seat configuration...so its not a big
deal.

let me know if you can help me out...
Thanks!
