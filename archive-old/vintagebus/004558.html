Chip-

Because of the length of my commute (120 mi. r/t) and the amount of stop and
go traffic (San Francisco Bay Bridge) my 67 bus is my backup commuter when
my 40mpg import is down.  The bus handles the 90 min each way commute ok.  I
don't have a tach installed but I can't help but feel like the motor (1600
sp dual kads) is working extra hard to keep up with slow lane traffic.  The
recent heatwave also doesn't make stop and go traffic very comfortable
either.  If I had a shorter commute I'd have absolutely no reservations
driving it.
