&gt; I have a 67 VW van and I need to replace the front and rear axles. Does 
&gt; anyone know where I can get the parts I need for a complete overhaul? 

Hi Thor,
Well the front end uses spindles which might require rebuilding by Bus Boys 
or Wolfgang International.  As for the rear axles you can and shoudl rebuild 
those yourself.  It is time you bought a Bentley reprint of the VW Bus Shop 
Manual for 1963-67 and did some studying.
