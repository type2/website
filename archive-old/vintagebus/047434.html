This is a hole in the dash tray of my October-1955 westfalia camper. 
Ordinarily would think some P.O. driled this, but there are paint drips 
(original paint as applied by westfalia). I have never seen such a hole 
as applied by the factory, so it must have been drilled by westfalia 
prior to painting. Anyone have any thoughts? Any ideas as to what westy 
might have mounted here????
