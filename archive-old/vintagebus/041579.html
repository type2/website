&gt; Hi David,
&gt; Sounds like the cheapo Dansk heater boxes.  Did they have fins inside of the 
&gt; exaust tubes?  If not then they are the cheapo ones, and will cause the 
&gt; engine to run hotter especially during warmer weather!   Eric&amp;Barb

Uh. Fins in the exhaust tubes?  Do you mean where the exhaust gases flow?
I didnt look, but i can tell you for sure that the numerous rusty old
german boxes that i own have no such fins....nor can i see any reason for
fins inside the exhaust tubes, they would only clog up with carbon over
the years, as well as increase backpressure on two cylinders...


Now, if you are refering the the actual fins inside the box (outside the
exhaust tube, between the tube and the metal casing), yes, these boxes
have them, and they looks just like the ones I use.  The boxes are nice
and heavy, the linkage works right, the flaps work right, they fit
right...I have no cause to suspect that they are not what GEX claims,
remanufactured German.

As for running hot without these fins...I'm at a loss to explain this.
Please, fill us in on how the lack of fins inside the exhaust tubes will
cause the engine to run hot...



later...david
