Subject: Re: [VB] Crows foot rims

jp told me one time that as far as he could determine the crows foot rims were outfitted on commercial type2s for just one or two years - '63 and '64 i think.  he said he'd not found any information that stated whether the rims were installed both front a rear or just rear.  his truck now sports a complete set (including spare) though his truck's production isn't within the years these rims were used.  is this information of jp's inaccurate?  is there some source that has the specifics?

&gt; I dont think they really took preferance about which model got what.
&gt; I think the lemerz/crows foot wheels got fazed out after about 1960 or so.
