Hello all:

Just raised my head from my stubborn engine rebuild long enough
to do a little website housecleaning and add some info on the
mysterious 1977 tent -- now identified by Bill Bowman.

As always,
- I don't sell tents &amp; don't know where to get them other than the
stumble-across method.
- The VW Camping Tents site lives at
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/index.html.

Seems like I had some other recent submissions but danged if I
can't find em.  If you sent something my way recently, please
refresh my memory -- always looking for more info &amp; pix.

Joe
