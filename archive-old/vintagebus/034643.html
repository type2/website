&lt;&lt; This came from the Houston VW Club list. It's not really bus related but 
 maybe someone has seen the body?         (bus content...   I figure the 
trans 
 problem I was having is the fact that the trans was 2 qts low on gear oil)
 &lt;&lt;Charles Boucher, who was supposedly restoring my Hebmüller #6, the oldest 
 in 
 North America, has lost the body to my car. He now will not return my calls. 
 If anyone knows the whereabouts of body #6, please contact Don Garies at 
 dgaries808_at_aol_dot_com. Thanx.

How do you lose something that large?  I have misplaced my cup of coffee, 
keys, feeler guages etc etc etc, but never an automobile.  


poor guy.  ouch.  I've dealt with soime VW folks who were less than honest, 
but in comparison it was very small, and I feel lucky.
