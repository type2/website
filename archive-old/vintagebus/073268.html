&gt; I was given a SW gas heater on Saturday (woo hoo!!),

HOT! Mine is almost completely installed.

&gt; couple of T1 SW gas heaters that did not have mechanical fuel pumps
&gt; on them, and one had an electric pump mounted to it that looked
&gt; original, although it does not say anything on it stating
&gt; manufacturer. I fixed the electric pump (I think it sat full of
&gt; water for a while) and plumbed it straight to the burner. The heater
&gt; fired right up and kicked out some serious heat, and after figuring
&gt; out that the electric pump had to be powered where the coil is so
&gt; the thermostat would turn it off along with the coil when it kicked
&gt; in, it was functioning perfectly.

The literature I have found about the SW calls for the pump to put out
about 5-9psi.

&gt; But, because this is the only first hand experience I have with gas
&gt; heaters, I was wondering if it was normal for the exhuast to put out
&gt; black smoke (just faint, but it is there). It's not a lot, but you
&gt; can see it. Is it supposed to burn perfectly clean, or is this how
&gt; it is? I'll be installing it next weekend, and want to make sure
&gt; that something isn't 'funked' before I go through the trouble. I
&gt; assume it's fine, but it never hurts to double check!

After I got it in fine working order mine doesn't seem to really have
any noticable black smoke. It did have more smoke when the combustion
fan did not turn fast enough. Try drilling a small hole in the motor.
There is a felt spacer thing in there. Soak it in elec motor oil for a
day through the hole. it will help that motor a LOT.
