Let me say up front that I too think that the bus
looks great but...

An early double door panel with roof line
modifications including a &quot;DELUXE&quot; roof clip in
colored primer on top of another coat of primer for
$10,000.00?

Are you all insane or WHAT?

And I took sh*t for over a year in my attempts to get
decent dollars out of a really nice bus that had all
kinds of correct accessories, a very nice paint job, a
correct and very nice drivetrain? Gimme a break! I
consistantly got capped on from all angles because it
had an incorrect poptop and a real functional camper
interior in lieu of the &quot;correct&quot; and totally
non-practical ambulance interior. Yeah it was whacked
but it was really well done. Y'all busted my balls
because it &quot;wasn't correct&quot; enough.

I have been watching the hoards of rusted, beat to
death, extended or shortened saws-all candidates and
lawn jockey shells being marketed like they freshly
came out of Ben Pon's butt. Pffft! Is it just me or is
the &lt; *general &gt;quality of VWs being marketed and
shown at shows over the past 18 months REALLY sliding
like the recent stock market? *Exception given to the
obvious high end market and eye poppers.

Sorry to come off as a grumpy SOB but come on! I can
NOT express how happy I am to be primarily on the
sidelines watching the action. Perhaps I might stumble
 back into a project for the fun of it but it won't be
for stupid money. 
- Good buses deserve good money. 
- Cobbled buses ought to go for realistic prices. 
- The DD-Deluxe bus is extremely cool but to get $10k
as is in primer? 
- Or market an average fat chick bus that has &quot;little
rust&quot; for super strong money is a bit much.

I still enjoy reading and seeing finds like the recent
23 and 15 window score. It is cool to read of someone
scoring a free or a $150 bus that is being redone. It
still makes me drool to see a very nice original or
exquisite real resto or cleverly engineered custom (of
any type). But I am *very* tired of seeing trash being
pawned as gold.

Flame suit on and I dont G.A.S.- As the country tune
goes &quot;That's my story and I'm stickin' to it&quot;.
