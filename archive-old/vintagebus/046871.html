Hi Thomas,
It is not a bad idea to try a compression check, endplay, look for oil leaks 
and seeps, but...  Quite often some volks will take a tired old VW engine and 
replace the P&amp;Cs and possibly the heads.  Unfortunitly all too often the main 
and connecting rod bearings are worn to thier limit or at least close to it.  
The new extra HP from the new P&amp;C and heads that the short block is not used 
to puts too much pressure onto the old rod and main bearings.  Resulting in a 
complete engine rebuild soon after! 
  It is much like the first successfull heart transplant patient.  The poor 
guy had such low blood pressure from his bad heart he passed out easily.  
Once the new heart was installed he started to bleed all over!  His system 
was not used to normal blood pressure, so the doctors had to lower his blood 
pressure with medications.  Then slowly over time lower the amount of this 
blood pressure medicine to allow the blood pressure rise slowly and the body 
to repair and thicken blood vessels to deal with the normal blood pressure!
