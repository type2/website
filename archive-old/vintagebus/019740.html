Okay, I'm sorry but I have got to get this off my chest.  Hail to the
great NQ for allowing us the priviledge of seeing his &quot;private list&quot;. 
I loved the part in his message several weeks ago about after he is
done looking at it he will put it up for the rest of us.  Oh, and if
you buy something from the list let him know what a great job he did. 
Gee NQ, I know you've been around for a long time and go to all the
events and add alot to this list, but please, if your ego needs
boosted, do it on some other list.  Preferably nothing pertaining to
VW's since I am on acouple other list.  If I have any information that
would help a fellow listee, I'll give you the website address.

Kevin

&gt;   2 weeks ago you brought me over 500 hits to the page so
&gt; &gt; let's try for a 1,000.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Congrats, Erin.  I just checked out your ads page and I was visitor 
&gt; #623   It is quite a deal to get that many hits. Keep up the good 
&gt; work in passing along those ads - you are definitely doing the vw 
&gt; community a service.
