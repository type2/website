Hey Volks

After the hassles of the grenaded clutch plate and then
breaking the accelerator cable in my 75 Fleetline panelvan,
I was enjoying driving the bus again but, within days of
getting it back on the road, the clutch started making odd
noises and eventually it wasn't disengaging properly,
leading to crunching gears and slipping clutch at traffic
lights.

So I pulled the engine again on Monday morning to find that
the needle bearing in the flywheel gland nut had
disintegrated. I wish I'd noticed that when I changed the
clutch plate two weeks back. I swapped the gland nut for a
good one and the bus is running great again.

I guess I should be grateful to the Ratmobile for bringing
up all these niggles now, before we head out on a planned
long road trip around Easter.
