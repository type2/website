well, my corner window may have been feeling a bit neglected, since I brought
Mr. Truck home,   so I figured I'd send a bit of tlc that way.

I took the old decklid off the other day.  The beautiful one I got in Montana
has a hinge on the right side, but not the left.  SO I undid the screws on the
left lid to hinge, and tried to undo them on the right hinge to body.  That
was not fun, so I trie dthe hinge to lid, and those undid.  I seem to remember
it coming off about 4 years ago, my ex welded some holes in it.  He did not
grease the srews, but they came undo.  the right side hine was still on, and I
ended up drilling.    i used a left hand drill bit, and left an extractor
removed the left screw.   I couldn't get he right one, so squirted lotsa
liquid wrench like holy water as per Muir, and switched over my liscence
plate, and wandered in some other direction.   Looked at the rear bumper for
it.   I had let go of the rear bumper I had had, as I had a better one, but it
needed assembly.  I had put one side together, and I noticed a broken bolt in
the other side.  So I drilled that out.  Extremely boring.   Drilling out
hardened bumper bolts is not my favorite way of spending a summer evening.  

Today I pulled it into the garage to get out of the sun, and stared at the
drilled through screw.  It was pretty durn centered.   I tried the extractor
again, but no go.   I ended up using a slightly larger drill bit (1/64 inch
larger)   I checked against the other hole, to make sure of the largest size I
could use.   Then I went up another 1/64 inch.   I think the third one popped
it out.  Hooray!!   Attached the beautiful new sealing wax red decklid, with
the engine prop that has the paint over the bolt  :)   Greased all the bolts,
selecting good ones from my bolt bins and tossed the marginal ones.  The latch
was stuck, even though I has soaked it in Liquid Wrench last night, but with
out much ahssle it came  free and I added oil and it was happier.   Lid closed
funny.   Pulled apron.   Pulled tailpipe damper.  Replaced leaky donut with
new.  Replaced muffler bits.    Replaced apron with a thick washer behind on
left side (apron was slightly bent, may get replaced)    Cleaned groove for
engine lid seal and replaced seal.   Closes nice now, even if it is a bit
stiff to open.  oil hinges, any moving parts around there, engine lid stay
moveing parts etc.   Cleaned liscence plate light lens, connected wires,
replaced old 6V bulb w/ 12V one to match bus.   Works great.   Engine lid has
the little chrome thing around the church key hole  *with the spring*.  So
clean I'd eat off it except that would make the lid dirty.  (please excuse my
gloating)

Assembled bumpers- including tubes, guars, brackets &amp; splash pans.   Tried to
put it on, but it didn't line up to the bolt holes.  ?brackets left and right
sides?  the parts list does indicate so.  Will have to disassemble and re
assemble.   Went out for pizza and beer.  

so, what's for sale?      two project buses
