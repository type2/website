Warning! Do not be taken in by the Porsche side!  They don't have rockers, they have &quot;longitudinal members&quot;. 

Thom and other Valley listees who aren't going to BOR in Sacammena. You're invited to Fresno this weekend. No show, but you're welcome to stand around my doublecab and drink beer while I strip the 21 window for it's body and paint work. Might clean out my garage too.
