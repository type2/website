Hello...........it's not because of race, its because you know where its 
going. And why don't people want the buses to go there, because look what its 
done. Driven the prices to an insane level, and taken the fun out of it. WAKE 
UP and get a clue, does everything have to be racist? But at least Greg was 
straight up and said he was in the business of selling buses to japan, while 
others deny the fact and try to hide it. And everyone on the list can flame 
me, cause you know what, I will hit the delete key and go to sleep. G'night
