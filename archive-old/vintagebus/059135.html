Subject: Distributor and Latch quest.

Two questions:
Has anybody used a vacuum only distributor on a bus with H30/31? It's a
1679 with single port. (thanks to JP cutting and clearing a manifold
finally) I'm pretty sure it's a 68 bug distributor.
A question I thought I would never be asking is:
Who makes a good quality safari latch, especially stainless?
TIA,
John K.
