The holes should be the same size and location , all you should have to do is 
add a couple holes or something, I have been modifing the large holes (like 
62 up big light holes )back to the small  holes on several buses 1was  57 and 
another a 58and a 56 , if your going to do it cut a panel to fit the large 
hole and not slap a plate over the back and fill it with bondo. I have a 55 
here now from Fla that was hacked for the big lights , then later a cut out 
from a corner slapped in from behind spot welded ,then bondoed over.. bad 
part was the damn lights were still not in the rite place, not  a big deal to 
re do tailights . Later
