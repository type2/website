You can get these from any of the mail-order houses.  I've seen
two styles; the ones I got from Ronnie are soft rubber, and the ones
I got from Wolfsburg West for the '55 were plastic.  I liked the plastic
ones slightly better, because they had a &quot;flat spot&quot; on one side, which
made them fit the channel better, and they have a flatter profile, so
they didn't stick up as high.  I think the rubber ones were an adaptation
of a bug part.
