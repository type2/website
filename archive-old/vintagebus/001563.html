Subject: So how far is too far? and just wanted to pass this on

Namecalling can really get you nowhere...

Just wanted to forward on this little tidbit on to the concerned folk.

So on to newer and more productive topics...

How far is too far to cut up a bus?  Should the region matter?  A beater or
cut up candidate on the West Coast of the US would be a daily driver or
resto candidate on the East Coast.  Simple as that.  When is it a marginal
decision to cut it up vs. consider relocating it?  I paid $1,200 for a DC
that would most defintely have been a donor on the West Coast.  I drove it
home, but was fortunate I didn't have an accident it was in such poor
general shape.  By the time I get it back on the road, I will probably have
put more than $8k into it.  I will drive it everyday.  If I had bought a
California car, I would probably have put less than $4k, only because there
most likely would be fewer metal parts to replace.
