&gt; Then, following the directions on the web page mentioned above, I added
&gt; water, iron rods, salt, laundry soda, and a battery charger.

I went to the website you referred, but I didn't find any mention of salt to the
solution.  Is this your addition, or did I miss a something (a page somewhere
else perhaps).  If it is your addition, what does it do?

Thanks,
Aaron
