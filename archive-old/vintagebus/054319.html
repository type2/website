Subject: how comfortable is a vintage bus for a large human being?

------=_NextPart_000_00D0_01C166A8.A357BE60

In Jan., my wife and I will be outnumbered by our children, and so we =
require a larger vehicle. Although an SUV is an option, neither of us =
are sure that it is the best option. By a stroke of genius - ?!?! - we =
thought we oughta consider a vintage bus. This would be an &quot;every day =
driver&quot; -- and I *am* concerned about the *reliability* of an old bus; =
but before this concern comes my concern that I, at 6' 5&quot;, might not fit =
behind the wheel of one of these buses.

Can anyone speak to - and hopefully allay - this concern?...

Other thoughts / suggestions / advice would also be *much* appreciated.

Thanks,
Matthew Weymar
