    You could dig up some sensitive material with this thread....
    Something that I witnessed years ago was an amazing sense of wonder and
happiness visible in my girlfriend at the time when she drove my '65 for a while
on a trip back from a university-level environmental conference in Ohio...
     I'll never forget that moment when she exclaimed &quot;I'm driving the
*bus*!&quot;...
    There are a lot of bus-guys that are IMHO overprotective of their buses...
they won't let their wives/girlfriends into the drivers' seats. neither do they
try to involve same with routine maintenance or repairs.
    clearly, you are missing out on something potentially wonderful.
    encourage and build up your partners...
    I feel it is much more desireable to have your mate as a partner in this vw
bus thing than simply as some kind of accessory...
    whooo... soapbox, there...
    anyways... if things work out really well, encourage her to take *you* for a
spin in the bus. it just depends on the situation, i guess.
    It is a leap of faith, mayhaps...
    an act of trust, definitely...
    the payoff is in the reciprocity.
