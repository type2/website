Anyone have an extra set of wiper arms laying around? Mine were ripped-off (literally) years ago, and I finally replaced the broken off shafts. Now all I need are some arms and blades. I'm not real concerned about great condition, just as long as they work and are not bent. Even just one for the driver's side would be a good start.

Thanks,
