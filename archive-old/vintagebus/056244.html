Joel,
You are correct. Mixture was due to HUGE main. Leakage was just bad
luck. One had wasted shaft bushings, one had a bad lower body. Might
have been damage in shipping, as the idle cut off plastic was all
busted, sign of droppage. I best the Brosols, CAN work great, just gave
up in favor of old metal.
AL

Al-
Congratulations on finally getting that carb issue sorted out. Don't
knock the Brosol 30/31 too hard, I think you just had bad luck with
them. I have two, and the only problem I have with them is they come
with a 120 mains, way too big for a stocker motor. I rejet mine like the
1970 30 PICT 3 and am quite pleased with the results. I have a feeling
that there are a lot of VWs out there running way too rich.

Replaced the Brosol 30/31 that was routinely drenching my motor with gas
yesterday. Flipped it upside down for giggles, barely a drop left in it.
A nice crack through the lower body left/right halves created this,
visible slightly from the back of carb.

The 1970 Pict 30-3 I replaced it with was jetted to stock specs for a
1600SP from 1970. 112.5 125 air 65 pilot. Sanded down exhaust pipe to
get silver, and slapped her on. Barely had to tune for idle, very close
off the bench. Bus ran clean, strong, no hesitation, leaks, good pickup,
better engine temps, better heat (slightly) and a nice grey exhaust
pipe...Moral of story, KIGS....Keep it German Stupid... I had poor luck
with two brosols, both new to near new, both leaking and running rich
beyond what the jetting should indicate. Now for the accel bowden tube I
found and real preheat...
