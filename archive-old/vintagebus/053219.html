Subject: Re: [VB] VW ads in 1963 newspaper

There are 2 versions. I have seen another one that also includes a 'thing'
and a ghia. The car they see coming down the road is the new Micrcobus, at
least in the version I saw.

earlier
&gt;this week.  Briefly, it showed line drawings of people standing around
&gt;a Beetle, then a splittie, then a late-model Jetta, then a New Beetle.
&gt;The last scene shows people standing looking down a road, presumably
&gt;at the next vehicle from VW.
&gt;
&gt;I don't remember if the Bus was a Deluxe or what, but I do remember
&gt;that it had the later turn signals.  I think the Beetle had a big
&gt;rear window, too.  For some reason, the logo on the front of the Bus
&gt;wasn't fuzzed out.
