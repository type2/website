Subject: Gettin' a '66 Westy!
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 1998 13:37:41 PST

Hey there fellow bus freaks,

You might remember I crashed my bus a couple months ago, when a Honda 
hit me at a courtesy corner (his fault) and it got written off.  Poor 
cannabus. :-(

I looked for a splitty in the neighbourhood for awhile, but after I 
looked at a totally rusty, moldy shell of a dormobile with no interior 
and most of the parts in boxes, for the bargain price of $1200, I 
decided that hey, for that price I might as well take a road trip too.
I may be crazy, but I'm going to Tennessee to get a '66 westy 
walk-through in April-May.  From Vancouver, BC.  It seems to be ideal 
for me: a very reasonably priced though far from perfect bus with some 
personality that will be suitable for camping and hauling stuff and 
people around.  And my old bus is a '66 too.  Oh, and I'm bringing my 
motor with me.  Among other things.
So, I'm open to comments, advice, etc. from all around.  There's a good 
chance I'll be making the trip back (~3000 miles) solo, which is a 
little scary but I think I can do it.  I've never left the west coast 
before, so this will be quite an adventure for me.
One question: we're trying to plan this trip, but we don't know what a 
reasonable number of miles to travel in one day is, what with all our 
metric confusion.  We'll be driving down in a '74 Bluebird schoolbus at 
about 55 mph tops, with 2 or 3 drivers.  Any ideas?

So, I guess I'm a semi-wannabusser with one yard bus.  Oh ya, you people 
who wanted parts off my '66, I now know pretty much what I need off it, 
so I can sell stuff.  I also have a nice dash section to fix a hacked up 
radio area if anybody needs it.

Happy bussin'
Diana
