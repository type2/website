I know the owner of the DB and the Camper featured on the windshield.  It
is parked on his grandfathers property (for sale, as well).  I went out
to look at it one day, but there is too much metal work involved for my
humble talents.  Bondo everywhere, rear vent has been cut out and has a
hinge on it, engine &quot;runs but isn't hooked up&quot; etc.  I saw the &quot;camper&quot;
too, which is just a panel - stripped - with the windows on the sides. 
If you can handle metal lovingly, the '59 is probably a candidate. 
Nowhere near complete, but you need to know what you're doing.  Email me
if you want me to drive over and get any details for you.  It's just down
the street from my office.
