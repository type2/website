Subject: Re: [VB] Gas drain tube behind filler flap in dual cab

My 67 doublecab has 2 drain holes in the floor directly underneath the 
gas tank, one hole at each end.  The holes drain any gasoline overflows 
from expansion in the tank, as well as any water blowing into the 
compartment through the side air vents.  Each drain hole came with a 
2-inch rubber drain tube inserted in it, the same type used in my bus 
battery tray--which is also the same tube used in Beetle headlight 
bucket drains.  If I fill up my tank without drawing it down enough 
before I let the truck sit, the gas expands past the cap, down the 
filler neck and into the compartment, and then drains down that little 
rubber tube into a puddle underneath.

Still manages to smell up the cab for awhile, though.

&gt; Just working on my trusty but very crusty oz crew and am wondering
&gt; if crews have a drain tube running down from the  gas tank filler spout 
&gt; support(like other splits?).  Hard to tell with mine cos not much was left there.
&gt; If no tube, surely overfill spillages just don't end up pooling 
&gt; on the floor near the gas tank?
