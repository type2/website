Subject: Re: [VB] how many fingers am i holding up? (was: On labels)

&quot;Have you ever noticed how you get flashed the peace sign whenever you are
out driving around in your bus?  Why?&quot;

it's reflex, easier than an awkward &quot;hi&quot; wave, plus you don't have to know 
how to count....

&quot;Oh by the way, after a guy gets stuck behind me on the highway at 60/65
mph for a few minutes I see the bird much more often than the peace sign.&quot;

oh so true, i can't say i'm totally used to it yet or that it doesn't 
frustrate just a little, but i'm always getting cut off, flipped off, 
glared at, tailgated...etc. so for me it's reall, REALLY, refreshing to 
see a friendly wave (any number more than one finger) by a fellow vw 
enthusiest on the highway. it somehow makes it worth it.
