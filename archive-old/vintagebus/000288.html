&lt;&lt; Just had the carb rebuilt -it was so nasty it took 3 days to get back-now

Hi Chester,
Hmm, could be wrong carb jetting for the engine and VW.

&lt;&lt;On the fan housing, rear right lower corner, there's a rectrangle lever 
with a small nut and bolt with a thin wire through it connected to 
nothing-What is this for?&gt;&gt;
That is for about 1968 VW to control the air intake preheater air.  Once the 
engine is warm it does not need so much hot preheated air to the carb.
