Well folks, I have too many projects and a few are going to have to go. I.m
putting my 67 camper up for sale,

Engine is a stock 1600 out of a 72 beetle w/ new cylinder heads installed 3
years ago as well as the clutch being replaced. Transmission  and reduction
boxes rebuilt and BOSCH alternator conversion added 2 years ago. Rebuilt
steering box, swing arm bushing kit, KYB gas shocks, Michelin radials, and a
stock bus exhaust/heat exchangers  installed last summer. Also all brake
cylinders and master cylinder have been replaced.

Hard top (no pop-up), all orig camping interior except for fold-up table
which I made.. Full length roof rack. Front and rear bumpers. Turn signals
and wipers work (just passed inspection). Set of 4 Alpine speakers installed
(pull-out tape deck missing due to me forgetting tp pull it out.)  Body not
perfect but nothing huge wrong with it (except rocker panel under the cargo
door will eventually need replacement due to rust). Color is mostly primer
gray. LOTS of restoration parts including: full set of door and wndow rubber
(ordered from WCM last summer) for after it's painted, extra door
mechanisms. lenses, elect. parts, window glass, new headlight buckets, 4
spare roll out windows, sun visors, etc. These will all be included.

Has to go to someone who cares and will carry on the restoration.  $2500
firm.. E-mail me for phone#.
