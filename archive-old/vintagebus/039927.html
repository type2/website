&quot;I don't think that they should be able to ban any parts that have their 
logo on them unless VWoA actually makes a similar part or replacement.&quot;

well... thats the fault of the person/company that is reproing the parts. 
maybe the genuises should omit the logo in the molds. copyright laws are 
pretty simple:
LOGO or TM'd NAME + USING WITHOUT PERMISSION = NO, NO
its not rocket science. i would sue too! if i see someone using the logo 
that i designed for my t-shirts, im gonna take action. why shouldnt VW? the 
URL trafficing is what i dont agree with. why do some of you vintage guys 
(gals) take it so personally? i actually have a shirt with &quot;volkswagen&quot; on 
it.... im just waiting for them to find me... if they do, ill take it off.
