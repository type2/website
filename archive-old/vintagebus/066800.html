Subject: Re: [VB] lube it or just go at it dry?

&gt; looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
&gt; two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in

&gt; and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years experience
&gt; building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work has
&gt; a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your motor
&gt; and that they are best left dry. Opinions?

The instructions I got with my Total Seal rings said not to lube up the
cylinders.  I had always lubed them.  I called them and they said just a
very thin wiping of oil on the walls if anything.  I did it that way and
they seemed to seal fine.  They used to seal ok when I oiled them.  I'm
thinking you'll be ok either way.  I always do the Bon-ami scrub on new
cylinders so they need oiled right then to keep them from rusting up.
