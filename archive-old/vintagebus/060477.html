Subject:  BNNTA report from mamabus




 I was going to make my post, but there is no way I can top the address
below.

 I will add, a near perfect weekend!  I scored some very very hard to come
by
 parts....

 Hooked up with Steve Sandlin from Texas, the Locksmith, he made two of the
 old &quot;cut&quot;VW keys and re-keyed my side door to fit the key.....awesome

 Found Derek and his father from Demoines Iowa, they are getting me some of
the plastic curtain sliders for the 66 HipyBus...whooohoooooooo

And this one boy had an excellent 70's side tent, immaculate, but a couple
of the plastic hooks broke.  In our discussion, he produced a little baggie
with a few extras, and we
made a deal!!!!!

 And finally, feeling out numbered by the Buskatiers and the Der Busbiezter
Gruppe, with little Full Moon Bus Club representation, I am honored to
announce that my rescue team while parked on the side of the highway was no
other than Chris &quot;mymorningangel&quot; from Oklahoma, a fellow Moonie!!
whoooohoooooooo!

Near Perfect!!

All I can say, as for Steve aka &quot;Aun T M&quot; GLAD IS WASN'T ME!!!!!!

  Hey there,

  I have posted a few pictures.  The captions reflect some of the events of
 the weekend.

  I think Chuck got the day events down.  I am sharing my version of the
 experience at night and adding some commentary from the day.

 The Mamabus, in typical Mamabus fashion, showed up sometime around
midnite.
 Dwayne said he would save us a spot,
 and we apparently drove right past our tribe and made Dwayne get his
 exercise for the  weekend (besides lifting 24 ounce cans).  He
 ran to catch us but gave up at the bathhouse and we caught him on the way
 back.  We set up  camp in the middle of the group.  Dwayne and
 the Alexanders stayed up  for a few hours and enjoyed some beverages.  We
 were even joined by  Frank, who seemed to rise from the dead around
 1:30am putting to rest  false reports that he was in a stupor and possibly
 abducted by  aliens.  This late night adventure might not
 have been a good idea  for Dwayne, as he shot right through his six  pack
by
 sunrise.

  The next morning, Steve had a Guinness for  breakfast (a bleak sign of
 things to come) and we hopped in the HIPYBUS
  and made a really,  really long carabus through the country.  Steve  and I
 are not  familiar with the inner-workings of  VW's and
  thought an alien  spaceship was porting onto the HIPYBUS when we  heard
 loud banging,  screeching, and metal against metal!!  No need
  to worry though, just  the metal end of the seatbelt bouncing against the
 tire rim because  it fell out of the hole in the floor while
  we're cruisng down the  highway!!  That was pretty funny and scary.  We
 finally made it to  Hannibal and ditched the carabus (which was
  awesome with almost 40  buses).  We drove through town and pulled into  a
 GAS STATION, got  Steve his ATM machine (seriously), picked
  Dwayne up a sixer  (seriously), used the bathrooms and left.  We  were so
 close to making  it back to camp...but, as you may have heard
  from Steve's drunken  display at the shelter later, &quot;Frank ran outta
 F%$#_at_!&amp; Gas!!&quot;  Oh the  irony...we were just at the gas station 10
  minutes earlier.  Anyway,  another bus hooked us up with a ride back to
 camp.  Steve took Frank  back to his bus with some gas and they were
  back on the road.  They  then decided to do a &quot;pub crawl&quot; in Monroe City.
 They hit all four  establishments, hooked up some free sweet corn,
  stopped to steal some  of Clint's firewood out of the middle of a field
and
 then settled in  for the buffet dinner.  At some point during
  the night, Steve lost  his mind (must have been Ted's electric  cherries)
 and was a stumbling  drunken buffoon.  It was nice that most people
  were trying to  help &quot;put him down&quot; (like a lame horse)and  there was some
 nice video taken around midnight.  Working the camera
  caused me to lose focus of  cooking my blueberry &amp; cheese pie.  It burnt
to
 a crisp and was not  even suitable for Steve at that point.
  Highlights include him  attempting to urinate on or around Frank's
 hammock, and being carried  around like an injured football player by Frank
  and Chuck...but the  man refused to go down without a fight, thus
 explaining his blood- soaked T-shirt and Frank's ripped shorts.

  The next day (Sunday) was quiet.  Frank and I drank, Steve suffered  and
we
 all had a nice meal at Pizza Hut.  Sixer and Nellie went to
  the St Louis Zoo and we mostly just hung out around the fire.  We did have
 some excitement when we went back to the field to get some more
  firewood (Frank found this firewood in the middle of nowhere).  When  we
 were picking up some more wood, a nice man stopped by and asked if
  we were having car trouble and if he could help.  We said no thanks and
 then he said &quot;Hey, did Clint tell you all to come down here and
  take his wood?&quot;  Uhh, BUSTED.  So we put it back and headed home with
heads
 held low.  We burnt the DBG Christmas tree, which was pretty
  cool, bright and drew a nice crowd.  It was nice hanging out with
 theDBGers....Chicago with the &quot;in need of repair bus&quot; even fed Steve,
  Frank and me steak sandwiches since we had no food.  Mamabus finally  had
a
 story to tell about something breakingdown.  Our fridge
  stopped working and our food spoiled.  I'm sure
  you all feel very  sorry for us.

  We were up very early on Monday and Mamabus took the back roads and
 followed Hipybus all the way to Indy.  We did
  have to stop a few  times to let the 50+ car caravan, that was slowly
 building up behind  us, pass us on the two lane road.  We left
  around 7am and arrived at 4pm....long but relaxing day of driving
 53MPH....Luckily for us, we weren't Frank and didn't have another 4-5 hours
  to go....

  All in all it was a great time and we will not be missing the Missouri
trip
 in the future...It was a blast.

  See you in Richmond!!!!

 (Can someone please put the signs up pointing us the way to ATM before we
 get there Friday night?  And don't let Steve drink Guinness
  for breakfast).
