&gt; Pre-59 westy tent, Any color, poles, no poles, whatever. 

Elvis had one for $100, but last I heard, Jimmy Hoffa was buying it to 
use with his '53 Binz

&gt; Black front seat (Base is 55-59, backrest is 54?-57)(Any condition, Big 
&gt; bucks paid for a nice one)

Why pay big bucks when you can have Lenny make you one that will be so
close nobody buy Hans Knobel would be able to tell the difference.  They
used the same material as the early Porsches, which he has.  

&gt; Pass side front turnsignal housing (Bus, round hole on bottom, pre-57?)

I can't belive these would be hard to find.

&gt; 2 RASCHE 17mm bolts for spring plate to reduction box.

Why do these have to be RASCHE?  Any good h/w store will have the correct
size metric bolt.

&gt; 9-55 dated slotted &quot;smooth&quot; (non crows foot) rims

I've always wondered why people get so AR over the dates on rims.  Has
anyone, ever, ever, ever, in the history of bussing, ever *checked*?  

&gt; Pop-out window screws (18)

Wolfsburg west

&gt; Decklid hinge screws (17)

Ditto.

&gt; Cab door hinge screws (16)

Triple ditto

&gt; Cargo door hinge screws (8)

I'll see your triple ditto and raise you a ditto.
 
&gt; Rubber stoppers for flip hatch (Suggestions?)

Single cab gate bumpers

&gt; Rubber seal for flip hatch (Suggestions)

WW sells cargo door seal stuff by the foot.  I used it on my '55
and the profile was *EXTREMELY* close; probably perfect once you
factor in the age of the original.

&gt; Rubber stoppers for rear cabinets (Suggestions?)

SC gate stops.  No, really!
 
&gt;  

I had a bunch of these, NOS, but now I'm out.

Maybe I'm not as AR as I should be.  I've resigned myself that a 
restoration has be to a compromise, a middle ground between 
doing labor to make the original parts nice, using NOS parts,
or using repro parts.  The tradeoffs are labor and cost.  I could
probably graph it if I was bored.  For instance, I'm happy enough
to have a decent set of 16&quot; wheels; they're not  the &quot;proper&quot;
date code, and the codes don't match each other, but I have 5
and that's good enough for me.  I've 'cut corners' in some areas,
and still have $22k into it to date; I shudder to think what it
would have cost if I'd gone whole hog cadillac like Greg is.
