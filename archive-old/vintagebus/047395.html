Hi Clara,
Up to 03AUG64 there was a metal and ruber sleeve installed in the speedo 
cable hole on the inner side of the spindle from the factory.  From then on 
from chassi number 215 000 001, and installed by the dealerships in earlier 
buses was a modified rubber sleeve.  Both of these sleeves helped to seal the 
spindle to the speedo cable to prevent water splashed under high pressure up 
by the two front wheels from entering the spindle and getting to the front 
wheel bearing on that side (BTDT).  So when you remove the old speedo cable 
make sure to look for either of these sleeves, and if they are missing get 
one ASAP.  If missing for the time being plaster alot of grease in and around 
the inner spindle, and speedo cable once it is in place to help seal out the 
water, and if you do have the sleeve greasing it up before installing it on 
the speedo cable is a good idea to make it easier to install into the spindle 
on the cable, and help it seal perfectly to the cable.     Eric&amp;Barb
