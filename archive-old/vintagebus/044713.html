 Hi NQ,
 Hopefully you mean you drained the center section only.  To drain and refill 
 the center and then drain the RGB will drain off about half of the center 
 section oil you just put in!  This is why it is best to drain center then 
 RGBs.  Fill RGBs first and center section last!  Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;
yes,   do not think  of tranny center section and the RGBoxes as different 
oil wise.  It is one connected container.    changing just part is like 
draining 1/2 the oil from your motor and then topping it up.  when you go to 
change &quot;the other half&quot;, it is all mixed up.
