Subject: change in overhead vent
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was thinking about the overhead vent change that Cameron had described, and 
though I cant remember anything on the part above you head, could you mean 
the change for the on off switch on the left side of the vent?    I am still 
not sure exactly where you mean the changes are.
