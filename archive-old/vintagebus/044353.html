Subject: My Classic compromise

Well after some negotiations it looks like I'll be going to OCTO and 
the Classic for my first time.

The deal is me, the wife, and the kids are going to Disneyland. We, 
of course, planned it around the weekend of the shows.

We'll be in a borrowed Pl*m**th V*y*g*r for the trip...no VW bus.

But at least I get to go.

We'll be traveling that way the week before that weekend from west 
texas to Cali on I-10. Anyone or anything &quot;vw&quot; along the way? Let me 
know so we can plan to make our pitstops in those areas.

Looking forward to meeting a few list members out there.
