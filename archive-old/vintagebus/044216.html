Subject: Interesting Trade.....

Hey All,
I want to offer up an interesting trade for anyone interested.  I have a VW Trek Mountain Bike I would like to trade for either a pre-68 bus camper interior or a post-81 Vanagon Camper interior. Remember when VW was giving away a free Trek Mountain bike when you bought the new Jetta Trek edition?  This is one of those bikes.  It is a black Trek 920 model mountain bike with the &quot;VW&quot; logo in several places.  It has been used less than 15 times and is a SWEET bike.  I am also open to other VW item trades.  Anyone want this rare VW item that you can actually use???



Peace, John Baker
