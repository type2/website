Subject: Re: [VB] swing lever shaft bushing

Go to http://vintagebus_dot_com/howto/ for a detailed procedure on
replacing this bushing, and some other how-to's.

You don't need to drop the beam.

Tightening the steering box to fix slop is roughly equivalent to voiding 
your bladder the direction of a brisk breeze.

&gt;  I was laying under the truck today (62 SC), trying to see how to remove
&gt; the pin holding the swing lever in place. Is it nessesary to drop the
&gt; front beam for this, or is there a &quot;cheat&quot; of some way. The flvwps has
&gt; the pin &amp; bushings cheap enough, and that 2 1/2 inches of play is gettin
&gt; one my nerves. The steering box is tightened to the max, but theres no
&gt; play in it, a new one is in order real soon. Already have new tie-rod
&gt; ends, drag link, tires, &amp; shocks.
