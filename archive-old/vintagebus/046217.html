Hi Jason,
We have been able to get these off with no damage to any parts with a 3/4&quot; 
drive socket.  We also like to grind two or three more locking groves into 
the lower axle to increase the number of times the nut can be lock and thusly 
used more times since these seem to be a less and less common item from the 
VW shops.   Eric&amp;Barb
