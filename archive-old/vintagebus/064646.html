Subject: Re: [VB] wiper motor re-grease

well, it's like this.  You have to pull the wiper assembly.  This is a bit of 
a pain, means removing radio if in stock location, and removing speaker if in 
stock location, which I think means removing grab handle on dash, and undoing 
the screws for dash tray on right so you can push that down an inch or so to 
get the assembly out.  No special tools needed though.

lube all moving parts of the assembly, and check the plastic bushings to see 
that they are not ovalled, as ovaled bushings mean wiper slop.  think same 
bushings used in 66-67. Maybe even on bugs.  Make sure the pivots are lubed- 
the 65 pivots are one year only and AFAIK not reproed.

take the motor off the frame, and unscrew the metal plate opposite the cover 
that comes off easily.   The side of the motor that goes on the frame.  
Remove old grease, wipe off the gears, pack with new grease, install gears 
and cover.  Bench test before installing.-- see how much quieter it is!  I'd 
call it an afternoon job.

You might find the old grease is like a lump of crud.

Use new wiper pivot grommets when installing.

I did this to my 65 about 5 years ago- it just groaned w/o moving before, and 
it still moves smoothly and quietly, so it should last a while.

 how involved/difficult is it to clean/regrease the wipre motor? any special
 tools needed? or just screwdrivers/wrenches...the reason i ask is mine did
 not want to move at all last night-it was groaing away...i think it was
 either due to the fact that i had not used them in a while(over a month) but
 more likely the cold weather-it was as if the grease for the gears had
 gotten too thick...
