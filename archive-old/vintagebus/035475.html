Subject: Tranny Squeeking....and cows :)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Time to reseal one of the 67 big nut trannies today.  Should run pretty much 
leak free now!  Anyways, does anyone have a clue as to what common problems 
are associated with a tranny squeeking?  The squeek starts after the bus has 
run about 10 or so miles and seems to be worst when turning and starting off 
at a stop.  Could this happen to be related to the reduction bearings?  Im 
going to have to pull the thing apart unless I can fiure it out with some 
help and that would be a BAD thing considering its my only car ;)    Any help 
is very much appreciated!

If anyone in phoenix wants to stop by and hang out, come on over!  I even 
have cows you can pet!  
Im sure NQ would look great here on the farm!
