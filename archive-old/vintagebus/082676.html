&gt;i took off the little &quot;caps&quot; that unscrewed from the spark plugs,
&gt;and started her up.

Are you talking about the little brass (or at least metal) things that
are about 1/2&quot; long, 1/4&quot; diameter, with a threaded hole in the middle?
Those get put on the plugs for US-style plug wires, that have a little
metal cup that goes over it.  VW-style plug wires, as far as I can tell,
have a couple of stiff wires that catch on the threads of the bare stud
on the spark plug.  You can feel/hear the wires catching on the threads -
tick-tick-tick-tick - as you push the wires onto the plugs.  If you had
the caps on the plugs, but had VW-style plug wires, you could probably
still make it work, but it would be harder to push the wire over the end
of the plug.  If you had the caps off the plugs, and had US-style plug
wires, then the plug wires wouldn't make good contact at all, which
might lead to the problem you are having.

The other possibility is that you are talking about the plastic
connectors that go between the plug wires and the plugs.  In later VWs,
these had resistors in them to keep the ignition system from interfering
with the radio.  Sometimes these will get added to an earlier VW when
somebody puts a new set of plug wires on.  The ones with resistors in
them might have a little zigzag line (the electrical schematic symbol
for a resistor) molded into the plastic.  If the resistor is dying in a
connector that has one, it could very easily cause no or poor spark on a
cylinder, and rough running.

&gt;i got her to idle after about 30 seconds of nursing the gas pedal.
&gt;after she would stay running, i re-checked the timing, still good
&gt;at 7.5 degreese BTDC, and still running like crap, so i upped the
&gt;idle a bit

If you can get it to stay running, you might try this: Get a clean, dry
rag, grab a spark plug connector with it, and pull it off the plug.
Notice if the engine slows down or stumbles.  (If you get bit, you need
a drier rag or new spark plug wires.)  Push the connector back on to the
plug, and go to the next plug.  If all four plugs make the engine slow
down or stumble about the same amount, then something common to all four
cylinders (ignition, air cleaner, carburetor, exhaust) is most likely
wrong.  If only one of them doesn't make the engine slow down, then
something on that particular cylinder (valves, rings, spark plug) is
probably wrong.  If both plugs on the same side of the engine don't slow
the engine down, something on that head (cracked head, hole in intake
runner to that side) is probably wrong.

&gt;when i noticed a little floppy screw.

&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/186139.jpg

&gt;the carb is i believe a 30 pict 2. the screw i am talking about is
&gt;somewhere in the incircled area. the screw was stripped out.

Does the screw have a flat end or a pointy end?  If flat, it most likely
holds things together, but if pointy, it's most likely one of the carb
adjusting screws.  If it's an adjusting screw, it could very easily make
your engine run badly.  Also, if it's an adjusting screw, it should have
had a little spring around it, but that may have fallen out.

Which way does the screw go?  Up and down - parallel to the carb mounting
studs?  Left and right - parallel to the throttle shaft (and the rear
wheels)?  Front and back - parallel to the generator shaft and crankshaft?

Looking through the parts manual, you probably do have a 30 PICT 1 or
30 PICT 2.  Take a look at page 115 of the '67 parts book at
http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/5867part.html .  A40 is the volume control
screw (an adjusting screw) and if it's stripped out, the engine will
probably run pretty rough.  A35 is the bolt that has the main jet in it;
if this one was stripped out your carb would drip gas and you probably
would have noticed that.  A28 is the idle adjusting screw in the end of
the throttle arm, but it sounds like that is working OK on your carb.
A19 is one of three screws that hold the triangular cover for the choke
vacuum diaphragm on.  If one of these is stripped out, it might cause a
vacuum leak, which would make the engine run a little rough but probably
not really bad.  A21 is one of five screws that hold the air horn (the
&quot;lid&quot; of the carburetor) onto the main body.  There is one on the back
edge of the carb (front means front), just to the left of the triangular
cover for the choke vacuum diaphragm.  If one of these is loose, it
might cause an air leak and rough running, but again, probably not
really bad.  A86 is not a screw - it's the hook that the top end of the
throttle return spring connects to - but it does have a screw that holds
it to the carb.  But from your picture, your hook is holding up the
throttle spring correctly.

If the screw is stripped out, but the thing it threads into is not, you
can probably just get a new screw.  For A19 or A21, you can probably get
something that will work (metric) at a good hardware store.  If A40,
the volume control screw, is stripped out, you'll most likely have to
get one from another VW carb.  According to the parts list, the 28 PCI,
28 PICT, 28 PICT 1, and 30 PICT 1 all take one volume control screw,
and the 30 PICT 2 takes a different one.

If the thing it threads into is stripped out, you have more trouble.
Again for A19 or A21, you might be able to put a metric Heli-Coil insert
in it, if you can find one small enough.  (But the Heli-Coil kit will
probably run you $20 to $30).  If the hole for A40 is stripped out...
you're probably looking at another carb.  :(

Good luck!
