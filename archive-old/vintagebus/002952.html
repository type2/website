The green ones are the adaptor seals for early to late and vice versa, but
they are not included in the engine seal kit. Just ask for the green ones at
the VWFLAPS. Notice the different diameters one side to another and make
sure you use the right orientation.

&gt; Make sure you use the right seals.There are a few different variations
&gt; depending on the case and cooler inlet/outlet size.the reason for this is
&gt; the later cases had larger(I think) ports and when fitting a later cooler
&gt; adaptor to an early engine you need a seal with two different OD's for it
to
&gt; work right.Look in a new gasket kit there should be sets of different
color
&gt; seals red,black,white and green if I rember right.Might be the
problem.Hope
&gt; this helps.
