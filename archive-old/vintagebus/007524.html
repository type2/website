Everett,
   I went to MOFOCO last year. I don't recall seeing any pets. But I was
selling stuff and didn't get around much. I would like to give you one
warning before you leave. Be prepared to get reamed. They charge an arm and
a leg to get in and they weren't very friendly. Everyone I talked to from
that area (over a dozen) had nothing good to say about MOFOCO. I won't ever
go back.
  The DBG puts on an excellent campout that same weekend. Sorry, but I don't
think I could spell what it stands for. They are the Wisconsin guys from
BBTA. After the show last year we went to the Wildlife Refuge for some
beers. It was an excellent time. The DBG are the most excellent hosts.
  I do believe Brian Whittling is heading up that way. I'm pretty sure he is
on the list. If you want his address p-mail me.
