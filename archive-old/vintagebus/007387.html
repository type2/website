People that pay over sticker that much are foolish, I agree.  But obviously
you guys haven't checked into used car prices much.  NB's have a crazy
resale value!  When my girlfriend bought hers(2000 model) she paid less from
the dealer than we ever found a low mile used one for.  The dealers were
paying more for used ones at car auctions than they were buying them from VW
for.  This is 2 years after they have came out!  Her fully loaded 2000 model
with 30k still books for almost what she paid for it! $17,300.  She could
walk into the dealer today and trade it in on a new turbo and only making
payments on it one year not be upside down on it.  You can't name me any
other cars you can do that with paying less than $300 a month.  Like it or
not that's the way it is!

&gt; I know a girl who just *HAD* to have one of the first crop; she and
&gt; her hubby paid *$31k* - she still keeps the paperwork as a reminder of
&gt; their foolishness...

It's
&gt; &gt; pretty bad when you can find 98 new beetles on car lots and the net for
sale
&gt; &gt; for 10,000 dollars (or less) that were bought new for 26 g's plus! But
just
