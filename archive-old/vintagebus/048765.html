Subject: Nothing big...

Nothing big. Just took the '59 Kombi to the gas station for the first 
time. It's about a 10 mile trip there and 10 back. Luckily I live in 
a VERY small town outside of a regular small town...'cause I don't 
have my inspection sticker. But it was a good chance to actually get 
out and drive it a little and try to get a feel for things.

I was grinding a tad bit going into second. I guess i could adjust my 
clutch pedal a bit. But I think it was more of not moving the lever 
into the gear smooth. One thing I have to get used to is that in my 
bus, versus a bug, the stick shift is REAL close to my right leg. 
Almost not enough room there. Maybe I should skoot over a bit:)

Anyways, lots of fun. I'm gonna finally try and get my brakes and 
emergency brake fixed so I can get the bus inspected on monday. 
Hopefully it'll all work out. My luck, probably not. But I've got to 
try and be positive.
