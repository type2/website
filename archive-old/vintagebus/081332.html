Subject: for the canucks

ok, long time listee here, back after a couple years on the road. Time now
to get the long neglected projects back on track.

I need to order some parts, something I havent had to do before. My first
inclination is to order from Bus Depot, but my question for the other
Canadians is this-how much of a hassle is it (read expensive)  for parts
going thru customs?

I'm on the left coast and CIP is just across the water and has a Canadian
warehouse, but I'm leary after some of the posts.

Its not a big deal, just the ignition switch back for my 68, but I refuse to
give BowWow  70 bones for it.

Give a shoutout to Miles-glad to hear your bus is doing good and your
passing along the karma
