Don't you forget that the Volkswagen of today is NOT the Volkswagen of
old...not even close.  That Volkswagen died stopped supporting the older
cars and completely divested themselves from their past.  Well at least
until they could exploit it for the NB.


Possibly true, I won't even argue here. Exploit? I don't know. They came
with the idea of the NB to spruce up their sales. They were on the way down
in the US. US is the toghest market in the world you know. They don't have
to worry about that in Europe. And that's what they're doing with this
Microbus I think. They're not trying to bring back the times when Bus and
Bug used to be &quot;people's cars&quot; simply because that can not be repeated. But
once again, it's just my personal opinion, I kind of like the new Micro
because it looks a bit different that those bulky Caravans and Windstars and
it is in fact a VW. Might not be the same as it was 40 or 50 years ago but
you well know it will never be the same.


Just me,

Andre
