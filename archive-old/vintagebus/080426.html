Subject: Re: [VB] Re: manual choke installl in 60-67 bus?

Hi Clara,
We used a lamp cord tube from the hardware store, because we could not bring 
ourselves to ruin a good VW part.  Yes, it would be best to just copy the 
routing from a pre-1961 bus.  All the holes it passes through will be there.  
  BTW we think you must be using the &quot;forward&quot; to Email back instead of 
&quot;Reply&quot; and thusly the entire previous Email gets copied to the end of your Email.  
Not a good idea because it makes the list archives take a huge leap in size.  
Which will cause problems and more cost with the server, quicker and much 
faster.
  If you need some of the previous Email, highlight the section needed and 
click &quot;Reply&quot; and it will show up in the Email you write.
