&gt; Would like to hear your input and yes am always interested in buying good

Hi Michael,
That is a bit like asking how to tell the differance between gold and fools 
gold without any scientific instruments/tools on hand!  ;-)  The OG ones are 
heavier due to being made of thicker steel and the VW emblem is deeper 
pressed and sharper than any repros.  Have seen ones made a few years back 
from Brazil probably manufactured with the original German tooling that were 
exactly the same as OG, but had fine wire wheel patterns showing through the 
otherwise really nice chroming.  They were about $40.00 each back then 
through Wolfburg Warehouse so you might check with Bill there to see if he 
still can get those.
