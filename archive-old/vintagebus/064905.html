Subject: Re: [VB] Oil pressure dropped

Could it be the external cooler or something else? Would an add-on sump
help?
--------------------------
I'm running a big 12&quot;x12&quot; 30 plate oil cooler, a Ford FL1A oil filter and
an add on 1.5 quart oil pan.
If the oil gets a quart low it should show on your oil pressure gauge /
idiot light.
The oil pickup tube remains in the same location in the crank case, not
down in the lower add on tank.
My Type III engine with all the add ons requires six quarts of oil.
I'm guessing an additional 1/2 quart for the FL1A filter, 1/2 quart for
the Cooler, 1 1/2 quart for the add on oil pan and a half quart for the
lines.
The engines run a little cooler if you run them 1/8&quot; down on the stick
(less foaming, less fan effect from the crank) with less foaming you
should see more oil pressure.
You can see all these add ons at
