I'm doing that right this minute!

I use screw-hooks in the garage ceiling, and suspend them with bungies or
wire.  I get them about 5' off the ground or so, and I can work the paint
for just about any angle.

Vent wings, I stick the rod into a milk crate to hold them.

On the little swooshes, I paint the back first, then let it dry, then use
soft-release tape on the back, and tape them to something, and paint them.

Dash knobs: use finishing nails in a piece of wood, then place the knobs on
the nails.

Emblem: I lay it flat on a milk crate, with masking paper underneath,
arranged so that the little posts hold the rest of the emblem off the
crate.  Tape the paper down! (I learned this the hard way!)  I also paint
the back first, let it dry a bit, then do the front.

&gt;I'd like to paint 'em all at the same time. I want to make sure I don't
&gt;miss spots when I do it. Any tips on how to do it?
