I've got her loaded down with brush, bricks and tree stumps.  The back end
wheel  wells are down past the tops of the rims
(15's).  Since today is the 4th, and I won't be able to go to the dumptill
tomorrow, will I do any permanent damage leaving the weight in thebed for a
day or so??

I doubt it.  I left ~1.5 tons in concrete in my ex-Single Cab for hours -
instant slam job:

No problems, other than it was a pain to stop, I coasted through a red light
standing on the brakes.  ;)

If nothing broke already, it'll break driving to the dump from bumps in the
road.

Someone once told me they hauled 5000 lbs. of sand in their '56 Single Cab. 
They then dropped the taillgate and repeatedly punched the gas to spread the
sand over their property.
