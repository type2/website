Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] R.I.P. 'Rocky Mountain' Motorworks

......the show they had every year on the Saturday before the Bandimere show
&gt; here in Denver in early August.  It was a campout and attended by many,
&gt; some from this list I suspect.  Anyone picking up the ball on having
&gt; this campout this year?  I was thinking about trying to organize
&gt; something maybe at Red Rocks Park, just up the road from the Bug-In
&gt; show.  Thoughts??
&gt; 

I always enjoyed that campout _at_ RMMW, &amp; Red Rocks could be fantastic!
Possibly have The Stones play on Saturday evening?

Go for it-I'll be there to help if needed.
