Subject: Re: [VB] Lost Causes

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I went to the local restoration shop, he looked at me and
dead-panned &quot;there is a 20 month waiting list. why don't you find
someone who works on vw's&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 Well print this e-mail and tell him i have a longer waiting list than he
does probably, and i do almost only VW's. I just spent 20 months restoring
the 56 Standard sunroof,  and the same people delivered a 56 Kombi sunroof
to me when they picked it up, now its awaiting its turn in the shop.
From what i have seen of the work most of these dudes do your better off to
find someone who does buses anyway, regular body shops have no idea of how
to restore a bus anyway and they  don't feel they are worth the effort.
(shows how smart they are huh?).
Put yours on a trailer and send it to me or we'll arrange a pick-up for a
fee. 8 times outta 10 i get the ones every one else is skerd of. (Grin ) i'm
a transplanted Tn redneck, i don't sker easily.
