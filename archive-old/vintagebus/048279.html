 PS Would any barndoor owners like to Beta teat this dual circuit MC on thier 
 rigs and tell us if it fits?   EEE&amp;B
  &gt;&gt;
hey guess what, im the one who is testing this conversion out. i have 4 wheel 
discs on my 53,the MC  sets up just like any other bus .so far the only 
problem i have come across is the adapter has to be trimmed on the bottom for 
the splash pan to go on, no big deal.i dont see any reason yet for it not to 
work.and just so you folks dont get all bent on the modifications on my bus, 
it was like that when i bought it, but i re-engineered it for better. it was 
once the dubbed &quot;cal looker&quot; deluxe, of course on the Hall of shame.there you 
have it!
