&gt; that give it kind of a tilted stance?  and what about rotation and a
spare,
&gt; you said below 5jk x 14, was this the stock rim or was it a 4.5by14?  ive
&gt; gotten so many different responses to my question, im getting confused! &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi John,
&gt; The 15&quot; rim was used from 1955 into very early 1964 model year.  Except
for
&gt; some rare one ton Mcoded buses, and ambulances in 1963, and early 1964
model
&gt; year the 14&quot; rim was used from mid 1964 model year up to 1971.
&gt;      As for tilt we are running 25&quot; dia. radials on the front of our buses
&gt; and 27&quot; on the rear of our 1960 panel camper.  This results in only a 1&quot;
tilt
&gt; from front to back.     When we ran 25&quot; dia. all around, and a early 60s
bus
&gt; tranny we would get a speed of 47MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM in fourth with a 4.375
R&amp;P.
&gt; With a 27&quot; diameter radial in the rear we got 50MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM.  About a
&gt; 3MPH increase due to just bigger rear tires.
&gt;     With 25&quot; all around with a freeway flier tranny with a 3.875 R&amp;P we
got
&gt; 58 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM.  Then with 27&quot; diameter on the rear axle we got 67MPH
_at_
&gt; 3,000 RPM.  About a 9 MPH increase due to just bigger rear tires.
&gt;     As soon as we wear out the front 25&quot; dia. radials we are using on our
&gt; 1960 panel and 1963 SC truck we are going to 205/75R15 radials for the
front
&gt; (And rear on the 1960 panel due to installing the cut out rear wheel
wells.)
&gt; and this will reduce the tilt to less than 1/2&quot; with the 215/75R15 on the
&gt; truck now and later when we get new 1641 SP engine in the truck we will be
&gt; installing the set of LT235/75R15 (27&quot; dia.) on the rear axle which has
given
&gt; us 72 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM in fourth gear with the 25&quot; tires on the front.  We
may
&gt; just wear out the 235s, and then go to a set of 215s on the rear from then
&gt; on.  We will see just how it works out!
&gt;     We carry a 165SR15 radial (25&quot; dia.) as a spare to get ourselfs to the
&gt; next big town to get a repair or a new radial.  In 1960 and later buses
this
&gt; is the largest 15&quot; spare radial you can carry in the stock position.  In
1959
&gt; and earlier bench seat buses, and 1962 and later SC trucks a 205/75SR15
can
&gt; be installed in the spare position.
&gt;   As for rotating tires we have given that up due to we keep our
suspension
&gt; aligned and the tires all wear out at the same time per each axle!
