Subject: [VB] Bus tow bar in Georgia

Well, it's like this.  There is a high possibility that I can arrange a
trade of my Beetle for a '64 Kombi in similar condition, slightly worse body
but I feel it is a fair trade (I am bus biased).  The bus is in North
Carolina, I am in Georgia.  The bus runs but all of my tools and spare parts
are with my '67 in Cleveland (don't ask ;-)), I want to have a backup in
case the '64 dies.  Soooo...does anybody in my state or in S. Tennessee (I
live in North Georgia mostly, Dahlonega) have a bus towbar I could borrow?
I am willing to pay for the priveledge if necessary, or put a deposit on it.
I'd prefer this route rather than $185 for one of my own, as I'm a little on
the broke side right now :-)  TIA for any help.

Andrew W.
