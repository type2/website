Subject: Re: [VB] Fw: [BM-ArtCars] VW junkyard Santa Rosa

&gt;&gt;There is a large stack of VW beetles and vans on the southern end of Santa
&gt;&gt;Rosa, on Yolanda Avenue.  It's in a dirt lot that has a big sign in front
&gt;&gt;of it, announcing the sale of parts.  I know they sell whole units, as
&gt;&gt;well, since the van that was on the top of the stack is gone and another
&gt;&gt;vehicle is in its place.  (I think it's someone's collection, or a
&gt;&gt;dedicated VW wrecking yard, that's being sold out.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Pras
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
That belongs to a shop close by (Vans VW's) he is clearing out another 
one of his lots and the cars in  the dirt lot with the sign are being 
crushed. I was down there a week or so ago with Van (the owner) and 
pulled some misc. pieces off a couple Buses. I'm sure he's willing to 
deal on them since they are otherwise being crushed. Call him directly 
and tell him I sent you.

Here's his number 707.576.1216
