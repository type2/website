Subject: re: Seals for the gas tank doors in the 66 SC tresaseure chest

Rob spilled mead on his keyboard and this is what came out:

Looking for seals for the 2 doors inside of the treasure chest that go to
the gas tank area.  Anybody know what these are called or where to look.

Hey Rob,

  Horray!  I honestly can help you with this cause the side-loader has no
bed and I found there is a lot of room in the gas tank area to store
things. There is enough room for my floor jack, jack stands tool and they
are isolated from the gas tank with wood and rubber and are all in plastic
cases. So I made it vintage vw, but it is not stock.

  Here is what I did...I have put two hinges (westfalia cabinet with the
male-female pin so they can be lowered or removed easily) on the gas tank
covers, which I also put 2 gas tank locks so they can close &amp; lock easily.  
I used the worthless safari seals that came with repo set I bought and
they fit *perfectly* around the gas tank covers and make it waterproof.  
I'm sure front split window seals will also fit. I sent Ronnie a picture
of this, perhaps he'll copy and send it to you if your interested?

All wonderful fermentable things,
