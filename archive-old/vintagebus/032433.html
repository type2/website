It's been awhile but I finally got the proper colored gel sheets in. These 
are the three colors (Red, Green, Blue) for the speedometer indicator lights.
If you would like enough to do a few speedos, send a self-addressed stamped 
envelope to:

Ben Hawley
P.O. Box 881
Sugar Grove, IL 60554

I'll send them off as quickly as I can.

p.s. I'm not asking any money for these, but if you want to.......
