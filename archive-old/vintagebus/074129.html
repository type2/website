Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Restorations, rebuilds, customs and DNA

yes, and did he say you how much we have in common with yeast?   loads of DNA 
research was done on yeast, which actually is applicable to humanss.  Why 
yeast?   easy to grow, doesn't take up much space, is a eucaryote like us, cheap, 
and no one is going to protest if you kill and dissect it.  All mammals, and 
even all eucaryotes are amazingly identical at the biochemical level.  

back to buses... (busses?)   I didn't realise that some people use 
'restoration' to mean &quot;fixing it up 100% original.&quot;  though I can see that point of 
view.   I think of it as 'fixing it up', so I don't really find 'original 
restoration' repetitive or redundant.  

when is it better to restore/replace rather than leave the aged/worn original 
bits alone?

He says that humans have between 98.4 and 98.8 percent the identical
DNA as chimps.  Then he explains how not all DNA is coded, that is, has
a specific function.  Using only &quot;coded,&quot; or known function DNA, the
identical DNA between humans and chimps rises to 99.4%.
