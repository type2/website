Subject: B-J BS!

Just a quote from a Barrett-Jackson car description describing a 60's
Sundial camper up for auction.

&quot;
 EXTREMELY RARE AND MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLE OF A &quot;SUNDIAL&quot; 1960'S VW BEACH
 CAMPER WITH AMAZING ACCESSORIES AND OPTIONS. VEHICLE DRIVES LIKE BRAND
 NEW AND EVERYTHING WORKS. INCLUDES CABANA TYPE PUP TENT(THAT IS VERY
 EASY TO SET UP ALONG SIDE) AND ALL NEAT EQUIPMENT FOR CAMPING AND
FAMILY
 FUN. VERY UNUSUAL SEATING PATTERN ALLOWS INTERNAL ACCESS FROM FRONT
 SEATS TO CAMPER AREA,(DO NOT NEED TO GO OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.) OPTIONS
 INCLUDE INCREDIBLE ORIGINAL ALL WOOD INTERIOR (LOOK AT THE WOOD).
ORIGINAL
 RED LEATHER INTERIOR. FRONT MOUNTED SPARE. VERY RARE ROOF MOUNTED
 LUGGAGE RACK. &quot;

&quot;Very unusual seating pattern&quot;  LOL !!!!

Steve
