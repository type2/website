Perhaps you misunderstood the tone of my remarks; I wasn't denigrating the
event in any way, shape or form.

&gt; What is this list coming to when the list admin. can make remarks like that 
&gt; about people who do so much for not just the VW community, but for very 
&gt; worthwhile charitable organizations as well.  Ronnie and John are just about 
&gt; the best kind of fold anyone, VW nut or otherwise, could hope to meet.  
&gt; Perhaps if you would attend a REAL bus event, you might just realize what 
&gt; it's all about.  Until then, you might want to consider keeping your snide 
&gt; remarks to yourself, thank you very much.
