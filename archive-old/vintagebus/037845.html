I don't know how many of you are Volkswagen literature collectors but I'm curious if any of you know the value of a particular brochure titled &quot;Wer Fahrt Transporter&quot;?  Published around 1951, about 24 pages, some color plates, size is about 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;.

I'm considering the purchase of said brochure.

If someone else has one of these for sale or any other pre-56 Bus brochure, let me know.  :)

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
&quot;A '55 Kombi please, and gimme a side of NOS parts&quot;
