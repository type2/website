While cleaning out the *new* '59 Deluxe, I kept finding these curved aluminum hallow pieces, hallow at one end I should say, and filled with what looked to be mortar at the other end.  Came up with four at the end of the day.  I was about to throw them out, but after owning several buses I've learned to never throw anything out until you're absolutely 100% sure that it doesn't belong in the bus and has no value what so ever to you or anyone else that you can think of.

I then decided to pull part of the middle and rear seat covers off to determine if in fact they were correct for the bus as there were no grab bars on either.  Rear seat checked out. When I took the seat cover off the middle seat, low and behold there was that darn &quot;mortar&quot; at the top corners of both middle seat frame sections.

What to do when reinstalling a new grab bar, if I can find one?  Why in the heck were they ever installed that way in the first place?  I'm thinking I'll drill out the &quot;mortar&quot; and insert a sleeve that will fit snugly in both the seat frame and the aluminum ends.  Anyone else ever run accross this situation? and how did you resolve it?

TIA.

Robert
