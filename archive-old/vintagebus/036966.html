Subject: Re: [VB] Got 40 HP Flywheel to trade anyone?


 where do you live?  I have an extra stepped crank FW 6V small clutch, you 
could have free, but are you going to be at the Puyallup show on Oct 14th
?

 Thanks to many of you here on the list, I have learned that the 40 HP engine 
i picked up to replace the destroyed 1500 engine in the '64, cannot use the 
same flywheel from the 1500.  I guess I should have done my research BEFORE I 
picked up the 40 HP motor (insert string of curse words here!!) Anyway the 40 
HP has no flywheel, and I really want this to be a totally FREE bus when I'm 
finis
