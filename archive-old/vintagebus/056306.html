Subject: should I feel bad or good

Hi All,

We've beat up the topic regarding VWoA and their relentless pursuit to keep
people from infringing their marquee.... I've had mixed feelings about this.
But yesterday and today, two things happened.

1)  A post was made to this list (and several others) asking for pics of
after market wheels.  I was about to email my web page url with my
collection of wheels and I saw he listed a web site so I clicked on it just
to see... and what do I see on the front page?  An image that I've posted a
few times on the samba in the for sale section of an original dealer poster.

2) Just posted today on thesamba gallery are two pictures of my 67 tipper...
one is the original picture from Bob and the other is the picture taken off
my web page showing the hydraulic pump.


I guess the thing that bothers me the most is both of these people never
emailed to ask permission to *publish* my images back on the web nor did
they reference anything.  Sure, I take images off the web and save them on
my hard drive but I use them exclusively for my own reference.  If I ever
use something I try and contact the person that I got the image from to ask
permission and then I try and reference them in what ever I am using the
image for.

Thoughts?.... or am I just being a whiner?


David
