Subject: Generator not charging

At last!! Green bus runs again. The generator not charging issue was
resolved by polarizing it. I followed the Idiot Guide's directions. Before
hooking up the last wire, it said to spin the generator clockwise to get it
moving. When I touched the wire it sparked a little. At first I was
concerned that it might fry the generator. But instead, the generator
started spinning (motoring). I kept it going for the prescribed 15 seconds.
It gets up to way over 100 RPM.

When I started the engine with everything reassembled it felt so good to see
the generator light go right out. Thanks everyone for the solution.

Dave
