When I got some original seats out of a '58 deluxe for my '56, I was told by
Neil Pickett to us a bottle of Pro 409, Scotch Brite Pad, and a bucket of
water.  Spray the 409 directly on the seat.  Let it soak in for a couple of
minutes.  Then take a moistened Scotch Brite Pad (those green things available
at Walmart) and rub clockwise a few times.  Then rub counterclockwise a few
times. Make sure to change the water and pads regularly. 

My wife and I spent the better part of a weekend cleaning two original rear
seats.  But they turned out very nice.  You just have to be patient.
