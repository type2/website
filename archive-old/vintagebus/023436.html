Yes, '67 had a larger tank (11 gal?) that one of the recent mags (VW
Trends?) recently (last 6 months?) did a &quot;upgrade on how to go from 10 to 11
gallon 67-only tank&quot;.  I think they described it having a &quot;hump&quot; on top.

Somewhat of a joke if you ask me... why didn't they mention the possibility
of using a loaf tank?

Hey,

While looking over my new to me 67 Westy HT, I noticed something that is
not on my 65.  It seems that the gas tank is a bit bigger.  Along with
this there are two support struts that brace the floor of the tank bay.
They look all original and don't seem to be a bay window tank retrofit.
Did the 67's have bigger gas tanks?

This bus also has a camber compensator.  Was this a VW part?

Steve
