&lt;&lt; Eric,
  Can you nail down the 15 to 14 change date any closer?  My SC was 
manufactured on 21 Nov 63, #1204409. It now has 14's but are they stock? 
 Thanks for any help.    Bill    &gt;&gt;
Hi Bill,
Here is the info from our bus parts manual.  
Wheel Discs
211 601 023 A  Wheel disc 3.5 DX16  Up to Chassi No. 20-117 901.
211 601 027 E  Wheel disc 4.5 KX15  From Chassi No. 20-117 902 up to 1 219 510
211 601 027 F   Wheel disc 5 JKX14 Up to Chassi No. 1 219 510   M215 option  
Used from somewhere in early 1963 production, 1 ton payload and 1500cc engine 
option.  This dics size was used standard from Chassi No. 1 219 511.

So it looks like your bus came with 15&quot; rims unless it has the M215 option 
code on it's front ID plate.  M215 parts have a &quot;D&quot; after the part number for 
the one year only pieces of this suspension package.  You are welcome,  
Eric&amp;Barb
PS We are looking for any M215 parts.  We only have a full set of the rear 
and would like to complete the front suspension we have and have a few spare 
parts for it all.
Thanks,  EEE&amp;B
