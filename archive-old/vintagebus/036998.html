thats too bad, i went to that show a few years in a row. i remember it being
free, i think...the first year i went there was a cool 56 deluxe mowing the
grass because it was so low,i was surely surprised. the last time i went there
was, from memory, about 8-10 split buses. i rather enjoyed that show. Vermont
is such a nice cruise too, i was formerly of NH now reside in Florida, working
on my 53 deluxe, hopefully about 3 more months to go on it. and daily drive my
64 camper, sometimes a 61 beater singlecab for the work loads!
