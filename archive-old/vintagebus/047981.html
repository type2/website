&lt;&lt; For those of you who like to badger about things like this.....  JUST 
IGNORE THIS MESSAGE!!!! 
 I always wonder why people criticize when all the intention was to let 
people know what was out there and try and help people.....

Hi Mike,
Because it really was badly posted on Ebay.  We actually would not buy it 
from a stranger when posted that way due to it sounding rather fishy.  If it 
worked when removed then just say so and when about it was taken out.  
Generally people have tired of the advertising phrases of &quot;Lifetime Warrenty&quot; 
which can mean as little as less than a day or &quot;Up to XX%&quot; which 0% still is 
up to!
  
   We were hoping in the future you might take these points into 
consideration and thus be able to to post on Ebay better worded and that way 
you are more likely to sell items just by phrasing it better.  
We speak from experience of selling for over a decade up and down the West 
coast at swap meets.  When at home enjoying a good movie we can be often 
found cleaning, polishing, repairing and tagging items for sale not only with 
price but for what and which year VWs the parts fit.  At every swap meet we 
sell at we get compliments from volks who love thier VW but are not into 
studying/memorizing all the parts for it.  They just have to look at the tag! 
 Plus we are almost always loosing our voices after a day of talking at a 
swap meet informing customers about the parts they are looking at (or for)  
even if we do not have the item!

Maybe you did not notice we even gave you a tid bit of info on what year 
buses they would fit.  Many a time we will look over a VW part that turns out 
to be something we are not interested in after all on Ebay and drop the 
seller a note on what year or type of Vw it will fit.  We have always gotten 
nice responses from them which they did not even have to do!

   This last year we did very little selling at the VW swaps due to taking 
care of Barb's dad after he had a stoke just after Xmas 98.  So only Eric has 
been able to make it out to the meets just to look and buy some.  Even at the 
first swap meet, and all the others since, that we normally did sell at time 
after time volks have stopped Eric and inquired if things were alright with 
us.  Plus that they really missed our swap space of stuff!

So if you are going to post stuff on the list expect what could be called 
criticism, but realize that it is probably only &quot;constructive criticism&quot;.  
Then take it on the chin and look at it as a possible bit of info to improve 
what you are doing.  If not then you can always ignore it or ask for more 
info. if you don't understand why the person is responding in that way.  

Eric&amp;Barb
