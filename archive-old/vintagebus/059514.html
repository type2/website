Subject: Re: [VB] Engine install question...

Another trick that I do is chew some gum when I start the install. By 
the time I get to the starter bolt, I stick the gum on the head and 
it keeps it from moving while I get the nut on from in the engine 
compartment. One time the only gum I had was some kind of kids 
apsiren gum. Yuck!!!! The things we do for our VW's.


&gt;You're gonna have to get in there above the starter. There is a bolt that
&gt;goes through the starter and serves as an engine bolt too. Best way is to
&gt;have someone hold the bolt from the starter side and tighten the nut from
&gt;inside the engine bay behind the fanshroud. One thing that makes the job
&gt;easier is to weld a small bolt or something to the head of the starter/
&gt;engine bolt. This will keep the bolt from spinning while you install the nut
&gt;(it's hard enough to get your hand in there let alone a wrench!).
