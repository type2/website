There is a place on the San Francisco penninsula who manufactures reflective 
dash protectors custom sized for your vehicle.  He makes these things for 
aircraft while they are parked.  You have seen them... the aluminized 
rollout/fold-out things you buy all over except these are made to the 
specific vehicle and not one size fits all kind a thing.  Send him a pattern 
and he will custom make one for you if he doesn't have one already.  Been 
using them for years in my other cars... great item.  I have the phone 
number out in the car if you want it... pmail me if so or if the demand is 
there I can post it.

&gt;     Now how do I keep this thing looking great in the 115
&gt; &gt; degree Fresno summer?
