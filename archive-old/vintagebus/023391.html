&lt;&lt; I love the diaphragm clutch, it is much less of a &quot;knee buster&quot; than the 9 
spring, that thing was killing me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
We tried one of those and after a month working with a big bore 40HP engine 
in our 1963 SC we had slipping clutch.  during this month we did not even 
carry a load in the SC!  Rick Crandel with his 1776cc SP dual carb engined 
Westies had the same problem with diaphragm clutches over and over and never 
had a problem with the nine spring once he took our advice on them.  
  We do not sit with the clutch depressed at red lights the whole time which 
helps with both the clutch leg and lengthens the lifespan of the TO bearing.  
If we are first in line or second will keep track of things and have the 
clutch depressed and the tranny in gear just before the light changes.  If we 
are third or farther back one has plently of time to change from neutral to 
first after the light has changed to green.
  Have been wondering about using a longer late 70s model stock type1 rear 
cable arm work on the earlier tranny by cutting and welding the part of the 
swingaxle tranny side plate that holds and aims the rear end of the boden 
tube at the rear clutch cable arm.  This would give more leverage and less 
leg strength needed, but would only being able to do this modification when 
the tranny is out and axles off though.  
  The only other way would be to install a type 4 hydralic master/slave 
system to do the clutch cable work.   Eric&amp;Barb
