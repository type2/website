 &gt; Objet : [VB] engine lid locked!
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Is there an easy way to unlock a t-handle without the key? It seems that the
 &gt; 
 &gt; guy I got it from has never had a key for the locks (only ignition) and some
 &gt; 
 &gt; how the handle locked when I closed it last. So now I am unable to get to my
 &gt; 
 &gt; engine compartment and I need to get this thing going, I am sick of looking
 &gt; at it (Ok, I'm sick of pretending to drive it)
 &gt; Is it possible to unbolt the apron from underneath?
 &gt; Anybody in Houston know a locksmith?(that wouldn't charge an arm and a leg?)
 &gt; Any help would be appreciated.
 &gt; Thanks,
