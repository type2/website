Subject: Re: [VB] women &amp; mechanics

A few years ago I put the motor back into my bus and was trying to get it
running.  I couldn't get it to start.  My wife grew up on a very large farm
and ... those farm folk are pretty self-sufficient - so I asked her to give
me a hand with something - i forget what.  So - of course she whined and
complained and bitched at me but she did gave me a hand with what ever it
was.  Anyway - I couldn't get it to start and I went to the flaps for
something and she went back in the house.  When I got back from the flaps
she had pulled off my fuel pump and had just put the spare on.
