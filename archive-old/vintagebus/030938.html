If I remember correctly, wasn't there even a points system devised for 
this?  If you got a certain reaction out of someone (swerving, slowing 
down, changing lanes, etc) you got X amount of points.  I think it was 
mainly zapping radar detectors...  That had to be a couple years back. 
Probably something in the archives about it.

&gt; I DO recall many discussions on the Lists a while back along these lines...
&gt; a cell-phone zapper, etcetc... we're always ahead of the crowd.
