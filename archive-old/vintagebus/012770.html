how can there be restoration problems when you have to use the bus to get
to work (or the work needs the bus) I can't drive a bus on jack stands.
Am i wrong to think of my split as a escape pod?I drive a volks, i peddle
a schwinn and if i could remove the yuppie i'd ride a harley. you all
have fun on ebay looking for that realy kuwell hazet part im gonna take a
air cooled ride.
