I delivered a bus to the forwarders yesterday and came to the realization we
all have no clue as to how many of our beloved VW's are leaving the country!
The gentleman who filled out the shipping papers told me that there is
somewhere on the net you can find all out of country shipments and there
contents (unless classified) because it is public knowledge, HE said. There
were at least 5-6 more buses leaving, besides bugs and other erotic cars.
These were bound for countries unknown. The funny part was though, how many
are coming in the country, where the bus trade deficit lay? This was from
just 1 freight house, customs brokerage.

Then on the way home I stopped to pick up a bus (1960 DD Panel) that we
found for sale on the net. Very smooth transaction and the bus was
represented exactly, no surprizes, not like the hatch top Westy that is on
Everett's page for sale now (which is a total POS, I went and saw it) and
worth half if that of the asking price. So now that brings the grand total
of 4 DD in Havasu, see them at BBB V in January.
