&gt;But one thing you have to do to run them is make sure your headlight
&gt;circuit connections are all clean and well connected (especially the
&gt;ground).

This is a good idea in general as it will help any headlight shine more
brightly.

&gt;I have heard people talk about H-4's burning up light switches (they do
&gt;pull a couple of more amps) but I have yet to have one fail running H-4's.

The stock sealed beams were 40/50 W.  The H4 bulbs are available in 55/60 W,
80/100 W, and 100/130 W.  In other words, you're running at somewhere
between 30 W (2.5 A) and 120 W (10 A) more than stock on low beam.  30 W
more is probably fine; 120 W more may cause you problems.

For far more than you wanted to know about it, see
