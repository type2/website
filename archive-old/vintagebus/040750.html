Well, I really don't think you're a jerk, I'm just jelous.  Here in Nebraska you just don't run into that kinda stuff.  Yeah, not even like free loafs or super beetles, let alone 3 panels!  I need to go to California and relieve you boys of all that hard work of hauling off free, beautiful busses all day.  Yeah, that sounds rough.  Sorry for the cynicism.
