&gt;Wonder why VW trends and Hot VW's don't get hassled??

&lt;conspiracy_theory&gt;
Because they pay the proper kickbacks to VWoA's lawyers.  Or, because
they have money and equally good lawyers of their own, and VWoA doesn't
want to pick on someone their own size.  Besides, it is in the best
interest of VW Trends and Hot VWs for VWoA to be hassling and shutting
down Web sites that give out honest reviews and solid technical
information for the air-cooled aftermarket scene. 
&lt;/conspiracy_theory&gt;
