Subject: Holiday bus pics, stripping buses, and a SCORE!

Hey Volks

Well, I'm finally back from my summer holiday in the Cape. I
had planned it as a bus journey in my newly refurbished
Fleetline panelvan but that shifted at the last minute when
I got a call the week before we were due to leave from the
press relations manager at VWSA, offering me a New Beetle
Cabriolet to review, and saying they'd like me to have the
car for the holidays. (I have a freelance gig doing a
monthly motoring review for the in-flight magazine for local
cut-price airline kulula_dot_com.) Well, that was an offer I
wasn't about to refuse, as much as I despise the waterbug
and everything it stands for, so Gisela and I left the bus
and the camping gear at home and headed for Cape Town with
the top down, equipped with an overnight bag and two
sleeping bags (that's all you can get in the waterbug
cabriolet's boot!).

Since it wasn't a bus journey I won't bore you all with the
details, other than to say I met a couple of Cape bus folks
with whom I had been corresponding, and we also spotted a
few splitties parked in and around Cape Town while cruising
around posing with the top down. Photographs are linked off
this page:

Before we left on holiday I had to strip the last of my
scrap buses and dispose of the carcases. I spent several
weeks with the help of several friends and hired labour
stripping 10 split-screen buses, moving eight more buses and
selling several others. We stripped all the scrap buses
clean by the deadline, but the shells went for scrap with a
lot of straight, rust-free body panels on them that we did
not have time to remove. My special thanks to listee James
Philip, who made available his wife's Land Rover as tow
vehicle, and who worked like a donkey for several days.

Pics of the epic feat can be seen here:

On my return from holiday I loaded my panel up with a pile
of Beetle parts that I had no use for and which I could no
longer store, and carted them off to the Beetle repair shop
in the same street as my new home. I introduced myself to
the guys and gave them the Beetle parts, and the owner said
he'd recently sold his splittie bus but that he still had a
full-length roofrack cluttering up his yard and did I want
it? He didn't need to ask twice, and I went round his house
that evening and picked it up and what a score it turned out
to be: it is an original VWSA accessory rack. These racks
were locally made and sold through VW dealers as approved
accessories. You can see a picture of one on page 70 of
Volkswagen Bus - Camper - Van 1954-1967, compiled by RM
Clarke, Brooklands books. Page 70 and 71 of that book
feature a reproduced mid-60s South African magazine advert
for the unique-to-SA 10-seater Kombi. The middle pic on p70
shows a bus with an identical rack to the one I just got.
Mine is a little bent and needs new paint and wood slats,
but I should have it on my panel within a few weeks.

It's Friday and another warm, sunny weekend ahead. I think
I'll put the rear bumper on my Fleetline panel this weekend
and do some maintenance. I had to replace the clutch cable
this week after it broke 40km from home. Luckily I was able
to get all the way back without too much gear crunching!
