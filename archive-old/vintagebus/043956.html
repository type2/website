I had researched some of the bus library M code designations and found one
that said the number &quot;430&quot; was &quot;US dual cirquit brakes&quot;.  On further
investigation of my '66 Westy I found it to have the single reservoir
master cylinder, non dual cirquit system in place.  I'm guessing that the
M code is wrong.  The brake hard lines do not seem to be altered for the
single cirquit design.
I also recieved a new pop top seal last night from a supplier in CA and
for the $50 it cost I think this looks to be a good deal!  It's a
reproduction -vs- OEM/NOS.
What year did the engine cases start showing up with case savers??
I'm considering building a 2010 motor for the Bus and want to keep an eye
out for a case that already has them inserted.
I had thought about using a 1500 case but will hold out for a case with
the savers.  Any info is appreciated.
Thanks
