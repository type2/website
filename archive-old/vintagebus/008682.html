Hello George
    I have the same problem with my Alternator I bought a 75 amp Bosch and
when I turn the bus on I have to give it a good rev to turn off the light as
well. I was a bit concerned about this as well but it has been charging the
battery fine and my stereo which is somewhat of a battery hog doesn't seem
to hurt it either.

Hooked up the battery.  Turned the key to &quot;on&quot;.  Alt and oil lights on.
 Good!  Fired up the engine.  Oh-oh, alt light still on.  Blip the
 throttle, light goes out.  Repeat.  Same thing.  Perhaps my idle speed is
 too low or I have a bad connection in the alt light wiring.  In any case,
 battery voltage is 13.7V, so the alternator is doing the job!
 That's it!  Thanks to Chuck Notmeyer for pointing me at parts sources!
