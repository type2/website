Subject: Berg Shifter?

Quick question for the custom guys:

Is anyone running a Berg bus shifter?

&gt;These have a super duty 5/8&quot; shifter shaft that is extremely strong and are
warranted for one year against breakage. Reduces original travel by about
35%, 4&quot; longer and about 4&quot; closer to the driver. No more reaching for the
shifter. All have standard 21.50mm ball for 1960 and later buses. Originated
by Gene Berg in 1978. Made in USA by Gene Berg Enterprises. SW 9# &lt;

&gt;GB 6750 66-79 bus shifter. Fits chassis number 216-028-112 to the Vanagon

I figure it might be time to clean up that vague and sloppy shifting in the
stock setup...  I got to see a buddies old school EMPI shifter (old and
good, not the new crud) in a Beetle and it worked amazingly well!  The gear
changes were like butter and positive clicks into each gear.  Anyway it got
me motivated to try some new tricks with an old bus :)

I know some of you guys are running them so spill the beans if it is worth
the $ or not.

Also you can get custom engraved shifter handles instead of the standard
&quot;Berg&quot;...  Like in the movie &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; I keep thinking &quot;Go Baby
Go&quot; would be kwel :)   (granted no happy gas in this bus like on that
Mustang)   


Thanks,
