Hi Everyone,

    I've been having some tuning problems with my Weber ICTs that I just
haven't been able to figure out.

    I bought the set in good used condition.  I disassembled and completely
cleaned them inside &amp; out.  Everything as far as I can tell, is in good
order.  Here's the problem I'm having:

    It idles fine.  When warmed up, it revs from idle fine.  BUT, . . . If
I'm just cruising down the road at a constant speed, it coughs and seems to
loose some power (not much, just a little so that I notice it).  If I stab
at the gas, it accelerates fine.  It does the same thing when in neutral.
Off idle it sputters and even sometimes gets a backfire out the carbs
(usually the right carb) if the throttle is held in a constant off idle
position.

    I've sync'd them with a uni-sync gauge and they are dead on.  I've
checked/adjusted the linkage to ensure that the butterflies begin to open at
the same time and also hit the full throttle stops at the same time.

    Could this be jetting??  When looking through the archives, I noticed
that most folks mentioned having a balance tube connecting the two
manifolds.  I don't have one of these currently.  Could the absence of a
balance tube be my problem??  If these were my old 40mm Dellortos, I would
say I had a blocked progression port, but these don't have these and I
cleaned everything religiously before I installed them.

    These ICTs are currently installed on a 1776cc engine with 009 dist., a
mild cam &amp; mildly P&amp;P dp heads w/ stock valves.  I'm using a new CB rotary
fuel pump rated _at_ 3 PSI mounted directly under the fuel tank.  Any help you
all could give me would be MUCH appreciated.
