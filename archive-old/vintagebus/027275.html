Subject: steering wheel

Hey list-
Happy Friday.  Thanks for all the advice on the steering wheel
pulling...  I will probably try something without a tool, but not
something outrageous.

The thing is that I don't mind BUYING a puller for 20 frogskins from
Sears.  ALthough it was more than I would like to spend, the suggestion
about the multi tool from JC WHipme from our friend in OZ is not a bad
idea.

Seriously, when I posted I was just wondering if anyone had used the 3
pronger from Sears with success.

Although my whell is not in great shape, with some resto, it could be a
peach...

Which brings me to the next question.  Is the POR-15 wheel resto kit
worth a damn?  That S*#% is expensive, and after doing my floorboards,
despite being duly impressed, I would like to avoid making them rich.

Can't I just whip a little epoxy in the cracks, sand, shape and paint?

Furthermore, were original wheels actually painted?  I saw the thread
earlier on this, and mine appears solid.  Perhaps just a weak
observation in a dimly lit work area...

THanks
Mark
