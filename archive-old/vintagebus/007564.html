Nope, the rear window frame was sarificed. A person at Havasu wanted the
little squares with the cross-brake in them because someone had hacked their
truck to put little rear windows in. Remembered it on the way out to OCTO.
So, you ask, did I carefully drill a hole and use a jigsaw to cut them out?
Hell no. I took the sawzall from the window frame to the door pillar. So
sorry. Didn't know. Never heard of anyone looking for a rear window before.
'Course I never heard of anyone looking for the little squares, either.

Now, if he is looking for the rear window frame for a '66 or '67 that would
be the big one anyway, yes? I had a little one so now I don't feel bad.
