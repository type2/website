Subject: RE: [VB] Big nut RGB bearings and gaskets

I am currently out of gaskets (big nut) till next week. They are not hard to
find both small nut and large nut 1 dollar a piece, you just didn't look in
the right place. Or you can get away without useing them, I have used just
Curil T sealant between the halves without a problem, the few thousands
clearance without the gasket didn't seem to affect anything.

 Hi Thomas,
 If you just need gaskets you can make them out of simular thickness paper 
 with an Exacto knife.

I'll second that.  the gaskets seemed to be hard to find, and five bucks a 
piece if I wanted to wait for them to be ordered.   I traced the cover on a 
paper grocery sack.  You can trace the inside with a little difficulty by 
putting the pencil through the axle hole.  Punched the holes with a punch
and 
then cut along the lines with scissors.  Voila!   gasket!
