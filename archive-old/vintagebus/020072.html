well i finally fired up the new engine yesterday. i realized the electrical
problem..well two...first when i put the fuse box back together i missed
hooking up one of the wires, hence no go when i turned the key, then a 
battery that was on the weak side...

charged the battery for about 45 minutes...started right up. runs real smooth
and quiet, purrs at idle.

i checked the dwell with my new meter-it reads 46. It should be 50, i don't
know if my fingers will be able to adjust that last bit so i think i will
leave it as such.

i now need to adjust the timing, my friend just got a timing light, so i may
try that this weekend.

i noticed after driving home(around 8 miles) that the dip stick was hotter
than hell...is there any way i could have hooked the cooling flaps up
backwards? i put the flaps from my old fan shroud in, then used a linkage from
a doghouse fan shroud(they throw them out down here). i should have checked
the thermostat when i got out of the bus, i guess i'll check it today...it was
working on the old engine...
