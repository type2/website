Subject: Check This Deal Out---

Hi Terry,

Someone in South Africa wanting to buy NOS Vanagon jailbars in the US
for  import would need to be near brain dead. The 'vanagon' only went
out of production here this year. Jailbars would therefore be in stock
at many VW main dealers. They are neither rare nor difficult to get hold
of.

The format and content of that email is very similar to thousands, of
usually unsolicited letters and emails, that have been coming out of
Nigeria for the last 10 years or so. These scams usually rely on the
fact that people in the US and Europe do a lot more direct business via
the mail. When dealing with parties in Africa you would be ill advised
to send goods or payment for goods before absolute proof of the
completion of the deal as arranged was received.

In the event of a fraud being perpertrated via the mail there would be
little to no chance of any official investigation and the chances of
someone actually being convicted of an offense like that would be low to
zero.

Michael
