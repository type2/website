During the ol' warm-it-up, as my engine warms and the revs start climb, just
at the point where you would tap the gas pedal to bring the choke down a
step, it does so by itself. I guess when the rpms get high enough, the
vibrations of the stepped cam thing hit the right frequency and the throttle
arm jumps down a notch or two. Works every time.

I've never had a carb do this before, but this one (30 PICT-1) has done it
since I bought it new two years ago. I'm assuming this is just a bit of
&quot;personality&quot; and not designed into it.

It's perfect for those times when you have to go back into the house for
something while the engine's warming up. There's no need to panic and start
running for the bus when you hear the engine start to scream. I just drops
down to a nice idle by itself.

OK, so it's Friday....:-)
