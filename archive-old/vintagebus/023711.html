Subject: re:SOTO

Just curious, but does anyone know if SOTO was sold to Dave Heard when
he took over many moons ago.  I don't understand why he doesn't bring in
people to help run the organization.  Look at Neato.   They have grown
so much over the last few years.  Hot VW's not only advertises for SOTO,
they advertise for us the consumer.  So write in and express your
interest on the subject to them.  He does write a column for them so
maybe that will make a little difference.  Personally, if he allowed
people to help with the organization, it would be a better club.
