&gt; What is a safe max extended use (as in highway driving) rpm for a stock 
&gt; 1500 in good shape? 

Hi Andres,
That is at 3,000 RPM, in conditions above 80F, and/or steep long hill 
climbing, and/or extremely loaded, and/or head into a very high head wind, this can 
require dropping to 2,500-2,800 RPM to keep the engine cool enough.  Doing this 
jumped our MPG from 18-19 up to 27 with a big bore 40 HP engine!  Also engine 
rebuild lifespan jumped from 30,000-40,000 up to 80,000+ miles.
  Get yourself oil pressure and temp gauges to see for yourself.
