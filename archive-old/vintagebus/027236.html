They're *all* bad. If you're going to rebuild the RGB, just plan on
replacing all of the bearings.

&gt;  Is it possible that the wobbley stub axle is not the result of a bad
&gt; bearing( hoping for lower outer only:)?

Not likely to be anything besides bad bearings.

&gt; 
&gt; Can I get by with garden variety off the shelf pullers to get the bearings
&gt; off?

You can do this job without any pullers at all. There must be something
in the archives on this.

&gt; 
&gt; I am finding Brazilian and &quot;German &quot; bearing available. What to do?

Buy the cheap ones, with the exception of Chinese. I know a lot of folks
disagree with me on that, but I've been very happy with my Korean and
Czchecoslovakian bearings. The most important thing is to get the RGB
clean and install the new bearings without beating the crap out of them.

&gt; 
&gt; What should I expect the springplate to do when I remove the redux box?

Nothing. It will just sit on the lower stop.

&gt; 
&gt; Any caveats of advice would be greatly appreciated.

Don't buy a bus with a wobbly rear wheel. Oops - too late. 8^)
