&gt; I think the racks can hold more than the bus gutters, and they remain
&gt; the limiting reagent here.

&gt; Anyone know how much you can load on one of these racks???

 .....I've lounged/played cards/etc. on a og full length roof rack w/ 5-6
consenting adults, spare tire, gas can, adult beverages, etc. for several
hours at a time, &amp; not a problem at all w/ the rack or gutters. A ladder
really helps to keep a nice bus from getting trashed while volks of various
degrees of coordination/flexibility/sobriety/etc. try to get on &amp; off.
&gt; 
&gt; 500 lbs?  10 4x8 sheets of 5/8&quot; plywood?

 ......My personal record is 12 sheets of  5/8&quot; gyp. bd. on a Yakima style
rack on an A6 wagon! Who says Audi doesn't make a utility vehicle.( only 4
load points &amp; Mfr's limit of 110 lbs. on each rack! NOT!)

Does VW  mean 220# per load point???

63 DC- not sure what its hoops will carry!
65 poptop Westy- doesn't work very well w/ full length rack!
