My point, as stated clearly in the message is that there is no need to go to 
germany to buy an inexpensive puck. I really don't understand why you feel 
the need for so many rude, wise ass remarks. Who are you?

&lt;&lt; your point is ???????maybe your cool? 
 
 Oh yea well!!  I only paid $20 for mine...and I had to
 walk 25 miles each day in the snow to pick it
 up....and I had to eat rocks for lunch and....
 
 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &lt;&lt; I found dozens of
 &gt;  pucks in germany $300-$800
 &gt;   &gt;&gt;
 &gt; no need to go to germany, I bought mine for $500 45
 &gt; minutes from home. Would 
 &gt; I sell it for that? nope.
