Subject: Vw's needed for a movie in TX....
Mime-Version: 1.0

This was from the Austin American Statesman:
------------------------------------------------------------
(1/19/00)
Movie Cars Wanted Looking for cars 1948-1966 to be in a
movie shot in Central Texas. VW Buses to Cadillacs and all
inbetween. Restored &amp; unrestored. Call Bo Franks, 251-7353. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Funny how the VW bus is the BOTTOM of the food chain (with Cadillacs being
the top)! Too bad my '59 bus isn't finished yet. I could drive back and
have it make another cameo! Oh well, they're filming more and more movies
in Austin these days. I'm sure I can get it in one. (kind of a silly quest
of mine to have it in another movie after being &quot;fixed-up&quot;)
