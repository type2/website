where the fan belt

belt down.   I had

road trip last summer

suggested sanding the

and didn't get them

Lucky it was just a rusty pulley.

If a bus is eating fan belts and also making odd noises,
especially when engaging/disengaging the clutch, then it
very likely has a loose flywheel.

If it runs loose for any length of time it destroys the
crankshaft.
