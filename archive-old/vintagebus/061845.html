Subject: OCTO Stickers

Does anyone have any extra '99, 2000 &amp; 2002 stickers floating around. 
These are the small 2&quot; round ones.  I've misplaced my extras that I had.
 More than happy to pay for them and shipping.  Not sure what they went
for at the event.  I think it was a buck or two each.

Thanks!

Steve
