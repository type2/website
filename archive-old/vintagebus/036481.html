 What problems did you have adjusting the beam and how much movement put the
 height back to stock?
 I'm in the process of rebuilding a '69 beam and the ball joints and will be
 ordering the adjusters next week.

Sorry to be so long in replying, work etc.
The difficulty was that it was almost impossible to get the beam to adjust to
maximum high position. My plan was to get it to max height and then lower it
is steps to get the right height. The upper torsion arm had to be rotated
HIGHER than the stop that prevents the suspension from bottoming out to get
the adjuster to the max high position to bolt the adjustment down. My
mechanic figured out a way to do it but with great effort. it involved
removing the rubber suspension stops and making an adapter that fit on to the
adjuster bolt. I can get info on the adapter if needed.
we finally settled on an adjustment of &quot;down one notch from max height&quot; for
the top beam and &quot;down two notches from max height&quot; for the lower beam. This
results in a height about stock, and a pleasant spring rate, almost a
progressive spring rate which is more comfortable than stock. Since there is
some loss in spring tension over the great age of our buses and this is
somewhat variable, I suspect that adjustments will vary. Measure the distance
&gt;from the ground of a fixed reference point such as the fender lip with a
standard load. This will allow you to get the right height.
the belly pan had to be notched slightly to clear the new brake lines. No
difficulty as it was in the back part.
good luck  and keep us posted
