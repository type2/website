OK. I know it was a panel before it was converted to a Camper. I found an
electric heater that was sitting in the engine area for some reason. Was
that an accessory heater or something else? Did they install gas heaters in
campers?

&gt; Andre,
&gt;
&gt; I also have a 64 panel. The same heat diverter set up as you
&gt; have. There is also no heat outlet in the back at the base
&gt; of the engine compartment slope. This may be standard on the
&gt; panel vans.
