I guess I am hesitant because I have never dropped an engine and then 
succesfully reinstalled it again.  I always seem to uncover more problems (or 
create them).  I plan on getting the engine fixed up right, I was just hoping 
to make the car driveable so I wouldn't have to pay $150 bucks to have the 
beast towed to my mechanic.  I am a novice greasemonkey and my confidence 
grows with each job I do so I guess I should just break down and do the damn 
thing.  No time to learn like the present, right?  Carpe Diem!
