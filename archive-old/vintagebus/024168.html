&lt;&lt;  I'm pretty sure Herr Roberds' posting is correct, as I did see one of the 
wires from the relays up front spliced into one of the (supposedly) tail 
light wires. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
The reason we do not agree with this is that if the tail light wires are 
hooked together then both tail lights would blink at the same time whichever 
way the signal switch is flipped.  With no ground on the right electricity 
will go to the closest availible ground.  Which in this case is the left tail 
light via the running light wiring.   Eric&amp;Barb
