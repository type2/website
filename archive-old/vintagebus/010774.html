George,

   Hey. Great job on the ad. I think you gave it away, just my opinion.
I don't know what else this guy could want. With your discription and
the pics that's the bus. As far as the engine goes,....., hell for that
price he should be lucky he gets an engine!  .......... You did a good
job describing your bus.  Heck. It's not your fault they can't read.
