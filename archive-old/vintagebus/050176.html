Subject: Aftermarket parts, VW mags, general bitching and rambling (was:
 Dual Kadrons)

OK, now *this* was a very enlightening post (see below).

I made a post some months back entitled 'Hasty Engineering', where I tried
to explain how aftermarket companies with a small on non-existant
engineering staff have little chance of producing parts which are superior
to OEM parts.  They may be superior for a particular purpose (typically
racing), but for street use, they usually have a lot of shortcomings.

Of course I got shot down in flames.  A few of my critics were in the
business of selling aftermarket parts, so just follow the money in those
cases.  But others seem to have been offended by my heretical remarks.  I
was an apostate.  I needed to be re-educated, perhaps imprisoned until I
would renounce my impure thoughts.  Maybe a good public stoning would help
others to keep the faith, and avoid straying from the true VW path?

Anyway, I'm not trying to rekindle those flames (really!).

My point is that aftermarket parts such as big valve heads (often using
soft stainless valves, with low velocity ports), big carbs (no chokes, no
vacuum ports, rapidly wearing throttle shaft bores, drivability issues, or
made by Holly or Weber - the most maintenace-intensive carbs ever), 009
distributors (drivability issues), all may be great for a race car or hot
street car which can be reworked regularly.  But to expect to throw in an
aftermarket part and expect longevity and ease of use which is similar to
the OEM part is unrealistic.

Now my *real* pet peeve isn't the aftermarket manufacturers, it's the
magazines.  Many seem to think that HotVWs and VW Trends are like Consumer
Reports, and will give unbiased and objective reports on the parts they
write about.  If you believe that, I'd like to show you some lovely wetland
acreage I have available...

Those magazine articles, almost without exception, wax on an on about the
virtues of the particuler part or setup, and never mention the drawbacks.

My first experience, as with many other VW owners, was with an extractor
exhaust.  Do the manufacterers, sellers, or magazine writers mention that
your air/fuel mixture requirements will be changed when you free up the
exhaust?  That you will get a flat spot just off idle, particularly at
part-throttle?  Rarely.

Then there's the 009 distributor.  While they're great for Wide Open
Throttle, what about street driving?  Do the glowing articles ever mention
why a cost-conscious company like VW would employ complicated
centifugal/vacuum distributors, or dual-diaphram vacuum distributors, or
why VW switched from the 019 (which the 009 is a copy of) to a vacuum unit
in the first place?  How partial throttle response is better with a vacuum
distributor?  Rarely.

Then in 1978 I bought a new Special Edition Scirocco.  You know, the white
one with black accents.  I still hadn't learnt my lesson.  HotVWs wrote
that the Weber Big Throat throttle body was the hot setup.  I paid $65 for
one (when I was making $3 an hour), put it on my car, and guess what?  VW
actually had a reason for installing a progressive twin throat throttle
body!  With the Big Throat, it was almost impossible to start off from a
standstill in a normal way.  If you wanted to drag race, fine, but moderate
throttle application, ha!  That thing was like an on/off switch.

Sill not learning, I bought a set of European gennie VW GTI springs, and
Bilstein 'Sport Setting' shocks.  Those shocks must have been filled with
concrete, judging by the bone-jarring ride I got.  The only suspension I
had left, it seemed, was my tire sidewalls.  And the top-rated (in a Car
and Driver mag test) Phoenix 205/60VR 13 tires (made in Germany, $100 each
in 1979!) on BBS wheels (also $100 each in 1979!) had precious little
sidewall flex.  Before long I had a new-looking car, with 30,000 miles,
that rattled and squeaked more than most cars do at 100,000 miles.  But I
was confident that my car and my rear end were at fault.  After all, all
the magazines wrote nothing but priase for Bilstein, and the fabled GTI
(not yet available in the U.S. in 1979), was a supercar, almost perfect!

And the GTI springs, while lowering the car and giving slot-car handling,
defied the efforts of three different alignment shops.  Nobody could get
the car to stop pulling to one side after it was lowered.  Were the struts
and control arms fitted to the GTIs different from those fitted to US cars?
Who knows?  I had no access the a European parts catalog, and no reliable
source of information.  The folks who sold me the springs (German Motors
and Parts, now called GMP Performance) insisted in repeated phone calls
that all I had to do was swap the springs and align the front end.  My car,
or the alignment shops, including the best one in San Diego, must be at
fault.

Next was a header exhaust and Borla stainless muffler.  Do you think I
could feel the 'big power increase'?  Not by the seat of my pants, and not
by a stopwatch either.  But maybe I was just wrong to use such amature and
subjective evaluation.  After all, the gurus wrote that this was good for a
10% power increase, right?  And only the outside of the $105 muffler itself
turned out to be stainless, the tubing and welds were some cheap steel that
rusted much faster then the OEM exhaust, even in sunny San Diego!  Double
checking the Borla liturature, I found many claims of an &quot;all stainless&quot;
muffler, but no mention of the pipes.  Screwed again.

[As an aside, the other day I was paging through a mag which deals with
those Hondas and other cars which are all lowered to death, with megabuck
wheels, clear taillights, and polished stainless exhausts.  You know the
kind.  No Asian teen would want to be caught driving anything else these
days.  OK, so the mag did a test of various headers and exhausts on a Honda
Si.  This engine had around 120 hp to start with, and all they got with the
best of the $500-$1000 headers was about 3-4 hp at 6000-7000 rpm!  And all
they got with another $500 worth of pretty exhaust system was another 2-3
hp.  And this is the car mag version of the story, with the downside edited
out.  Does anyone remember the hotrodder's term 'All Show and No Go'?  When
you see one of those tricked out Hondas, bouncing along like a low rider,
with loud exhaust, then you can just laugh at all the wasted $$$.  My $2000
Mazda MX-6 Turbo 4WS blows tham all into the weeds anyway)

OK, I'm rambling.  Bottom line is that the mags are in business to sell
advertising, at least as much as to sell magazines.  The advertisers are
happy when the demand for their aftermarket products is pumped up by
glowing articles.  And the average Joe Schmoe always thinks that those
gurus who are pictured in the mags must be right, and Joe must have somehow
screwed up the installation of the parts, or Joe must be too stupid to
adjust the timing or carb correctly.  Anything but lose faith in the
magazines, after all, those are the Holy Scriptures of the VW religion!

So, kudos to Thom and the other real folks on this list, who post real
reports on real parts used in the real world, not PR crap about drag racers
and ad copy writers driving on smooth roads in SoCal.

&gt;You're building about the same engine NQ and I did.  He went with Weber 48
&gt;IDEs I think.  I ran a Weber progressive that was so lean I couldn't push
&gt;her over 60 mph for any amount of time.  Got 25 mpg though....  No one was
&gt;forthcoming with jetting help and I was running outta time so I tried the
&gt;Kadrons.
&gt;
&gt;You will find that the 044 big valve heads are not the ideal head for a bus.
&gt;  I've been running 044s, 110 cam, various exhausts.  The trouble with big
&gt;valve heads is that although they flow well, the charge velocity is rather
&gt;low at the rpms buses typically drive.  They breathe well at 4k+ rpm, but
&gt;real world driving rarely supports 4000 - 5500 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;Out of the box the Kadrons were jetted ok for my 1776.  Be advised though
&gt;that they do not have chokes.  If you drive your bus daily (you do, don't
&gt;you?) and it gets colder than 35 degrees your bus will not be happy until
&gt;the heads and intake tract heat up.  Less than 20 degrees and the top end
&gt;runs way too cold.  They do not have vacuum ports for a distributor so you
&gt;get to live with the mechanical advance beast, unless you drill the carb and
&gt;intake manifold for vacuum ports.  Modifying out of the box carbs just so
&gt;they'll work right just doesn;t make sense to me.  You can set your timing
&gt;and adjust the carbs to eliminate most all the stumble, but it will be
&gt;there.  The throttle shaft runs wear quickly too so be ready to pull them
&gt;after a while to get them bushed.  Trial by error, and judicious use of the
&gt;Archives will guide you in your quest.
&gt;
&gt;When I build the next bus engine, it will likely be a 'stock 1776', single
&gt;port, clean up the ports a bit, 205 dizzy, stock exhaust, balanced as best I
&gt;can, full flowed for filtration, doghouse w/type2 cooler.  Either a Pict 30
&gt;or maybe a single 40 IDE for a carb.
