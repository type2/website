been here, done that, got out the goggles and ear protectiuon and cut the 
front shift linkage off the buses with a grinder.  Had bought a repop one 
from WW, it has a slightly too large ID, but worked (not impressed I am)

your 60 standard has the front shift rod bushing under the shift stick, and 
then the two badminton birdies in the shift linkage tube, the front one you 
can replace by poulling the rear shift rod forward (after undoing front and 
rear shift couplings)  but the rear one you can one do with the tranny out, 
as you have to pull the rod back.  

the birdies are differnt than the late birdies- changed at chassis 835 xxx.  
dunno if the early birdies are repopped

 I'm trying to replace my shift rod bushing and it isn't going very well.  So
 it seems that my bus never had a shift rod bushing for the last 3000 miles.
 I guess if felt sloppy but ..... other than the occasional popping outta
 forth (which hasn't happened in a long time)  it seemed to shift OK.
 
 So my 60 standard only has one shift rod bushing right?  And it should be in
 the same way as those in the 63-67 bently pictures - right?
 
 One of the set screws had already been broken off and I broke off the
 remaining one (from the front coupling) now I'm stuck - I've drilled out the
 pieces of the screws but everything is siezed up.  I heated the coupling and
 tried twisting it with 2 pairs of vice grips and not luck.
 
 So, now Ive sprayed loosen stuff on it and I'll give it some time.  I really
 don't want to cut or grind anything but ...... I may have to.
 
 TIA
