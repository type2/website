&gt; supplemented with an electric cooling fan, do you need to change or modify
&gt; the Oil pressure relief valve when installing a system like this?

You might need a pressure relief cover to protect the filter and cooler
from blowing out, especially if there is a large pump installed.  The full
flow means that there is no pressure relief from the pump outlet until the
oil gets through your external plumbing and back into the case.  The pump
can generate quite a bit of pressure when the oil is cold. 
Check you oil pump cover, maybe it already has a check valve in it.
