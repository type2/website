Aaargh!
Would someone please describe to me what the horizontal linkage
between right and left thermostat flaps on a doghouse cooler engine
looks like? I have my engine out and apart and only now discover (as
always) that I have a pre-doghouse linkage instead of the doghouse
linkage that I need. What I have is a bent piece of flat bar: four
right angle bends  making a center section which is offset by maybe
1/2&quot; towards the front. I am thinking if I made a new one with a
greater offset (maybe 1 1/4&quot;?) it would clear the fan shroud. But what
was VW's solution?
So if my horizontal rod is wrong, is my vertical rod likely to be
wrong too? How long is the correct one, and where is it bent?
My bus is my only ride, so I could really use your help in getting it
back together as soon as I can.
Aaargh!
On a positive note, the drilling and tapping of the case for the
thermo bracket mount case went so smooth I wonder what I was ever
worried about.
I cleaned up my New Old Swapmeet oilbath aircleaner so I can even see
that red line and I will put that on with the preheat hose shoved
under the push rod tubes as per a Clara post in the archives. I might
even get fancy like Boeing and tie it in place with baling wire...
The oilbath is a latish one I think, has something about &quot;crankcase
ventilation VW 289&quot; printed on it, and two small hose fittings. One on
the dirty side of the filter (side), one on the clean (top). Which of
these do I hook by crankcase oil breather tube to, and what is the
other one for? Smog stuff on an oilbath?
Thanks everybody, I hope you are all having a fun weekend,
Two weeks to Alaska departure, I bought spare parts ($300 budget but I
want more) but that is another post,
I love my bus but damn if she ain't the little gold-digger,
New cats living in the barn, cutest little orange kitten and young
mum,
Hood CA now population 246, so says the census,
Goodnight everybody, tomorrow I will run faster, reach out further and
something else to do with Gatsby and his flickering green oil pressure
light,
Boats against the current,
Joel
