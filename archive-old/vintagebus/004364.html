Well I geuss I should have saved my self the time and read VanBondo post
first.We obviously agree and have come up with the same conclusion! Funny
thing is I plan to also go with the wood panels up front .My W.W. grey
panels have also warped badly.
I was at a website and noticed the SO34 Westy's with the front &quot;flip&quot;
seat came with the front cab panels done with Baltic Birch( I think it was
Thom's site, in the Westy section). This convinced me to do this conversion
on my 64 Kombi/Westy.
        Sorry for the redundant post!

                                               woody

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;
