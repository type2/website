&gt; I have heard from people who rented furniture and
&gt; antique tools to movie companies to be used as props,
&gt; and got them back with a hole cut in a hutch, tools
&gt; painted, and other terrible things done to their
&gt; antiques.  In that situation, they should have gotten
&gt; full value for the use of the item, as it's antique or
&gt; collector value was destroyed.

When working with the movie business, remember that the only thing on
their mind is getting the film in the can.  Damage to props isn't even
given a thought.  That's for the bean counters to deal with!

If you let them use your car (or anything else), you should make sure that
you go along to protect your goods.  The contract should stipulate that
any damage will be repaired to your satisfaction.

A friend used to rent harleys from his collection to movie companies.  His
contract stipulated that he be hired as a mechanic and that only he and
the talent be allowed to touch the bikes.  He would ride the bike onto the
set, the talent would sit on it for the shot, and he would ride it off.
There was also a pretty rough clause in the contract about making sure
that repairs were paid in full.

George &lt;--- who got his fill of the arrogant movie types while living too
close to the studios.
