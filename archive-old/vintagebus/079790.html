Subject: Re: Wing window Latch

Hello Everyone 
 
    I have now bought four of these Brazilian POS wing window latches that
have all failed on me. I got the last one tonight and turned it and the
handle broke right off. They are made out of pot metal and where they all
break is at the shaft the lock pin slides back and forth one. Can some one
tell me where I can get a good latch. Or if they have a drivers side bus
wing window latch around I could buy. I can use the passenger side bug latch
early as well.
 
 
 
Thanks for you help,
Eric
