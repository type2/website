&gt;&gt;Hi All
Im getting feed up off lying on my back under my bus trying to get it =

bus around its lenght axis.
There has been some talking on the list about these before, so here is =
my question:
Where is the centre of gravity point on a empty kombi shell (without =
engine suspension's interior and gearbox)?  I want to make the bus as =
easy to turn as I possibly can.
Could somebody who owns somting like this give me the messure from the =
bumper-mounting holes to the &quot;turning point&quot;?

Thanx

I too would be interested in knowing the approximate center of a '65 single cab. My plan was to make it adjustable so I could find the center myself, but a head start would not hurt.

Thanks,

Rick
