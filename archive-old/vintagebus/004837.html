Subject: Oil pump stud problem

I've been messing around with the 40hp out of my Single Cab for some time
now.  It had low oil pressure when I bought it so I stripped it down and
pulled off the oil pump cover.  The oil pump looked like someone had done
some home-made &quot;improvements&quot; to it with a dremel (wish I had a picture) so
I tossed it and bought a new, high-volume pump from my FLAPS (all they had).
The high-volume pump is thicker so I found some new Grade 8 studs that
seemed like they would do the job.  A bit long...  Anyway, 3 of the case
holes were either stripped or I trashed them so today I drilled out the 3
holes with a 1/4&quot; drill bit, tapped the holes for helicoils, and attempted
to install the new oil pump once again.  Nope, the helicoils pulled out of
the case in 2 cases, 1 stud stripped in the middle so the bolt just spun on
it and the last &quot;good&quot; hole looked like the stud was beginning to pull out
of it.  So my questions:

Are the helicoils the recommended solution for stripped threads?  Or another
method?
What the heck am I doing wrong?
Does anyone know the correct length studs to use with a high-volume, M6, 40
hp oil pump?

Frustrated,
