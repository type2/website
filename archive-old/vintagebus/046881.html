Thanks to everyone who emailed me with shock advice. I went wiht the KBYs at 
a great price 21.00 each ( i helps when you bring the parts guy fresh pasta).
My Question is, the old shocks where Fichtel Sacks 26x130 /211 513 031E .
are these orginal 33 yearold shocks!!!!! and if they are what do you think i 
can get for them on Ebay?
