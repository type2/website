Barry Wright asked:
&gt; Years ago I had a book with plans for building campervan stuff into a VW
&gt; van. I dont remember its name but the author was one Clinton R. Hull.
&gt;     Anybody got one they will copy and send to Oz collect?

I think the book you are looking for is called:

Plans and instructions for Volkswagen van camper / prepared by Clinton R. 
Hull. 

Our public library here in Austin, Texas has the 1968 edition.  It has plans for 
camper interiors for Bay Windows only.  So if anyone has an earlier edition, 
that's the one Barry needs.
