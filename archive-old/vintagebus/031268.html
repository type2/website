&gt;I have had a fuel pump metal tube pop out of the fuel pump with gas hose
and hose clamp still attached to it.  And this caused a fire.I have since
wired the parts in place and now hear the one on the carb is suspect to
&gt;
The one on the carb is A LOT more likely to pop-out.  Maybe everyone should
go back to 36hp Buses because they use screw connections?  ;)

&gt;I wonder about parts for sale on ebay and stolen buses parted out? (Buy
only from upright parts suppliers?)
&gt;
No, trust your local swap meet guy.

&gt;There is a opening and nut but no zerk fitting right in the middle of that
front beam( king pin?) Zerk it? Grease it?
&gt;
I think that's the bolt to hold the centers of the spring leaves inside
the front beam?  It's an allen head bolt with a locking nut.  No grease
needed.

Let's see... what else comes up a lot:

Only use GL-4 fluid in you tranny, not GL-5, even if it says it's GL-4 compliant.
You may have to search a bit for it in your area.

Grease your front end a lot, the owner's manual says every 1200 miles for
my Bus.

Save the old grease to lube other stuff like the brake shoe adjusters.

Repack your front wheel bearings every year according to the shop manual.

If your steering box leaks, mix some front end grease in with some GL-4
fluid to thicken the mixture, it may stop the leakage.  70s VWs used a thin
grease only in the steering box, according to a recent discussion on the
Type 3 list.

If you don't know how old your rubber brakes hoses are, they need replacing.

Completely flush your brake fluid every 2 years.

I'm sure there is more...
