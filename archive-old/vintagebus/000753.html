&lt;&lt; We have also seen Hirshler (SP?) made antennas used on buses.  These are 
the type of antennas that have a solid metal rod at the base of the antenna 
that 
 has a slight hour glass taper to it.  Have seen these mounted to the left of 
 the left windscreen and also center.  The left mounting the base is mounted 
 at about a 45 degree angle to vertical and then the solid metal base of the 
 rod it actually bent to vertical.  &gt;&gt;

Though I am unsure of the name this sounds exactly like what I am running on 
my Binz (with original safaris)  I can Email a picture to Thom, Everett, or 
somebody for posting if there is interest.  Let me know.
