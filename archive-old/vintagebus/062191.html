Hi Steffan,
Best to find a source for studs that are differant widths for half the length 
of the stud.  Then all you need to do is drill and tap the case in situ.  We 
have been able to find these in our local Lowes hardware store and if memory 
is correct they are 6mm and 8mm widths.  VW used these same type of studs for 
the exact same repair!  So your VW dealer might still have these in stock.
