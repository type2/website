Subject: Re: [VB] fuel flow problems

What kind of gas cap are you using?

This sounds like something is keeping the fuel from flowing into the
fuel line. If it isn't a plug in the tank then it could be a vacuum
forming as the fuel is sucked out and no air comes in to replace it. If
you're using a stock cap and have another one laying around, maybe you
could try swapping them out.
