Subject: Re: [VB] any one know the dimension of sc wood strips?
References: &lt;4a.c16ee48.2718e4b1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I use to have the dimensions. Teac is what i was going to use if I had
made them myself. It has the best natural oil in the wood to keep it
nice in the weather. Boats use Teac because of that reason. Try it out
but it's pricey.
