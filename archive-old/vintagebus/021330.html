Cecil,
I looked at the air box cover too. I couldn't come up with a good solution to
the weather sealing as you have, so I moved on. It is a bit off to the side
for my taste and could require significant angleing of the gauges to make them
easy to read. I like the ability to run the wires along the roof instead of
down the front pillar, down the nose of the bus then under the bus in the
weather. You will need to get a lighting wire from the dash so you can use
your headlight switch rheostat.
I do have my radar detector mounted just below the box on the driver's side.
Good luck and keep us posted.
