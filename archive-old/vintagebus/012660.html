&gt; What is the collective wisdom on the knock-off

&gt; axle nut? You know, the ones that you hit with a
&gt; small sledge to turn?

Jack, Im no expert on the subject, but I do know one
thing, you should NEVER beat on/beat off anything that
is being supported by bearings, be them needle or
rollers. I guess if your gonna change em its ok to
hammer on em to get the nut loose, but on installation
do not beat on em. The only time Id hammer em is
if someone were shooting at me:) What happens is that
everytime you whack em, the impact is transfered from
the tool to the nut to the axle to the inner race to
the bearing itself. When that energy transfer takes
place it flattens a spot on the bearing shortening its
life consideribly. Think of it this way, would you use
the same hammer on/off technic to get your crank pully
bolt on/off? Didnt think so:) Dont know what your
&quot;hammertool&quot; looks like, but mine has a 1/2 female
connecter to put in the ole breakerbar w/ a 4 foot
cheater on it:)
Just my $0.02 worth.
