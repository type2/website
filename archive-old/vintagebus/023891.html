If you are correct regarding VW's demand about stopping production on
the older style racks, we should all be outraged!  Not because some
aftermarket products are no longer produced, but because VW is, in my
opinion, trying to kill the scene that created the demand for the
rebodied golf...oops I me New Bettle...the RESTO scene!

The hypocricy of VW is unbelievable.  They take full page ads in all the
mags trumpeting &quot;With great pride, we're pleased to honor and support
those of you who've spent hours restoring, rebuilding and rekindling an
age-old love affair.&quot; (HVW's 1/98 page 9)  Honor?  Support?  When was
the last time you were in a dealership parts department?  I bet rarely
if ever!  If you did find yourself looking for that certain part to
finish you're restoration did you find it there at the delear?  Were
you  &quot;honored and supported&quot;??  Hey look, I own a 95 Jetta GLX...great
car!  But I've NEVER felt honored and supported by VW...especially with
regards to my restoration efforts.

If the previous postings statement is true regarding VW's P.I.P. edict,
than what is next?  I guess someone should tell Loren P. that he can
make a killing selling bud vases to VW for the NB.  Then they can tell
him to quit importing that shity overseas rubber...oh WTF just stop
selling to the restoration market all together. 

I know that this list has hit this thread before and enough has been
said to sink the Tiatanic, but if the allagation is true, its a SAD day
in mudville Casy!  Can anyone comment on the validity of said VW/PIP
deal?
