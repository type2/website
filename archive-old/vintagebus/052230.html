Subject: Re: Just how fast does your bus go??

yea, the speedo is correct, ive checked it with my GPS... whatever tranny is 
under there, like i said is smooth and quiet, but otherwise SUCKS!

just done know what to do... not too many people to help around here, and i 
dont know if im confident enough to drop the tranny. i have a drum to drum 
big nut, but it grinded a bit when downshifting.

&gt;Hi Bob,
&gt;If your speedo is fairly correct it sounds like you have a badly geared
&gt;tranny.  Possibly a 4.387 R&amp;P bug tranny!  You would save enough $$ in 
&gt;better
&gt;MPG by getting your cruising RPM down to 3,000 RPM to pay for a 4.125 R&amp;P 
&gt;or
&gt;freeway flier 3.875 R&amp;P tranny in less than 50,000 miles and have longer
&gt;engine life to boot.
