&gt; Hi Carl,
&gt; One of the favorites seem to be adjustable KYB gas shocks.  You also should 
&gt; check out your tires.  They could be real wimps and causing alot of your 
&gt; bounce and sway.  Which will get worse not better when loaded.  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt; 

I see at Bus Depot the KYBs and Boges are the same price:

Shock Absorber, Front, KYB Gas Adjust 55-79 Bus - 40% OFF!  $26.95  
Boge Shock Absorber, GERMAN, Front, 55-67 Bus, 54-65 Beetle, 56-65 Ghia 26.95  

Are the Boges oil-filled?  I see there's been a lot of discussion about gas vs. oil lately.

    -Carl
