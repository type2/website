&gt; Subject: crew cab headliners
&gt; I've recently become the owner of an early 62 crewcab. The truck is minus a
&gt; complete interior (do have front and rear seats) but my question pertains
&gt; to the headliner. After going thru the catalogs of various vendors I only
&gt; seem to be able to find vinyl headliers for crews 64-67. I had a 61 single
&gt; that had the thin rigid type headliner that slipped into channels and held
&gt; up by tension (for lack of a better word). Are the early crews the same?
&gt; Mine has a channel around the perimeter of the roof so it looks like it may
&gt; be. Does anyone now of a vendor who supplies these? Does anyone have a set
&gt; they'd either be willing to part with or be kind enough to use as a
&gt; template and draw me a pattern? I'd be more than happy to compensate for
&gt; time and materials.

My '62 crew cab has the gray rigid headliner as you describe. It has several
pieces, which insert into the tracks on the sides, and has a couple trim strips
which anchor it with screws across the middle and read. My '67 (for sale) crew
cab has a perfect gray headliner which looks to be exactly the same. I would
guess that these are the same headliners used in the panel vans and other
commercial vehicles, just cut to the size of the crewcab roof.
