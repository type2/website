Subject: what ever happened to the $500 bus?

Well, not quite $500, but i found a whole barn full of
splitties and an oval in Central Indiana that I never
thought I would see here in rust bucket central.  the
guy supposedly owns only one of them, a '65 double
cab.  He wants $700 for it.  the oval is sold, but
there's a rusty single cab and a kombi (both about
'65) that could probably be had, probably fairly
cheap.  Of course, this is Indiana, so the rockers are
gone, and the floors are ate up, but...anythings
possible.
