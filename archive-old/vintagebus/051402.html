Subject: Re: [T2] Its a boy! take that VWOA!!!

Congrats on the new addition.  You have to start them early in the way
of the VW.  I've been giving my son my old VW catalogs (RMMW, Chirco,
etc.) to peruse and drool on since he was old enough to care.  Now, at
two, he sleeps with them in his crib!

Later,

&gt; We have a new VW enthusiast in our midst!
&gt; My  first child was born January 30th at 8:22 am.
&gt; His name is Kafer and he was 9lbs 12oz's!
&gt; Think VW will launch the lawsuit against me shortly? hahah-  Since
&gt; they
&gt; think they own the word Kafer.
&gt; Think they can go after him for putting his own name in the title of
&gt; a
&gt; certain Automotive business he may run someday?
&gt;  On another note- Someone told me that VW gave college money to a kid
&gt; that
&gt; was born in the back of a Vanagon. Anyone know of any truth to that
&gt; story?
&gt; 
&gt; Bus update- While I was at the hospital my Barndoor got rained on when
&gt; we
&gt; got hit with that &quot;big&quot; storm here in AZ. All that freshly blasted
&gt; metal
&gt; now has a light coat of surface rust-  ah well, have to go over it
&gt; once
&gt; more before moving it inside.
