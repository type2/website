Ken:

Couldn't you pull the distributor drive shaft and reset it a few teeth 
one way or the other to give you the adjustment you need?

&gt; The problem is that I can't align the distributor right because the vacuum

&gt; know if that makes a difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody run into this before? Electric fuel pump? Abandon the distributor?
