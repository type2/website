I was doing some light reading of my wiring diagram a few
days ago (1955 Bus) and I noticed that the diagram
indicates the wiring sizes as in 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 6.0,
etc..  The numbers seemed to not correlate with wiring
gauges sold at my local hardware store so I was wondering
what the numbers meant?

It appears from looking at the nice wiring in my Pick-up
and referencing the diagram that:
0.50 = 18 gauge
1.0  = 16 gauge

Going from there, the main power cable from the starter to
the fuse box, which is marked as 6.0, would be 00 gauge but
I think it's 8 gauge or so.  Obviously it's not a direct
correlation so how do I read it?

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
