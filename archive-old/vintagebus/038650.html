Fellow Sundialers,

same thing here.  My '65 Sundial has paneling everywhere.  Some of the
interior on mine has been replaced and/or water damaged, but the headliner
is in great shape.  It also has the little compartment above the bed, and a
3&quot; closet rod to hang clothes from.  It's almost road ready.  I was trying
to put in a new clutch cable today.  I can;t get the darn thing through the
last little bit of the tube.  Once that's done it's new tires and I'm road
ready!  Anyone have any suggestions for good tires?  (Just kidding!)

&gt; Very nice Bus! Congratulation! Looks like Sundial was doing everything the
&gt; way you described since I had a 64 that was also full of paneling. I mean
&gt; there was a side clothes closet, both sides were paneled, headliner, front
&gt; overhead, front doors and there was even a small compartment above the bed.
&gt; I also thought that it was just fabricated by previous owner but sure looks
&gt; like it was not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi all--
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; snip&lt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; She's a Sundial conversion, at least that's what the little metal plate
&gt; says.
&gt;&gt; Anybody know what's supposed to be inside? This one just has a bed and
&gt; closet
&gt;&gt; to hang clothes. And wow, what a shade of paneling. Do I *have* to keep ot
&gt;&gt; stock? :~) BTW, instead of a headliner there is the same paneling up top.
&gt; Is
&gt;&gt; this the way Sundial's came or is this someone's elaboration on the theme?
