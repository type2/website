Subject: Re: [VB] Time for a new welder

Everyone that does a lot of welding seems to recommend the Lincoln or
Miller brands, which are pricey. But, for me at least, and I think many
others, our welding will consist of a few panels on our own busses and
that's about it. After that the unit will likely sit. Do we really need
the high priced unit? I rarely drive a screw and when I do, my cheap
Black &amp; Decker unit does the job just fine. Can anybody recommend a
welder that won't bust the budget?
