Hey Everyone,

A few weeks ago, I removed my passenger front hub to inspect my brakes while
doing an adjustment. The brake pads were like new and inside the hub was
grease free. I blew out the dust...respirator of course :-)....and decided
to repack the wheel bearing while I was in there. I didn't completely clean
out the old grease, I just began packing some Slick 50 Grease One in the
inner hole. After packing the inner, I moved to the outside opening and
packed until I could smooth off grease on both ends. I cleaned all the
excess from either side and pushed the drum back on the axle. I cleaned up
the grease that the axle pushed out and re-installed the nuts. Shortly after
this, my truck started pulling to the left at hard stops. I've been driving
it for two weeks with this occasional hard pull to the left. Today I decided
to pull this hub again to have a look see.  The entire inside of the hub and
brake parts were dripping with wheel bearing grease!  I bought some brake
cleaner and degreased everything. Currently, my bus is sitting in the back
yard with the passenger front on a jack stand, wheel off. The outer bearing
came out when I pulled the drum, but the inner had to be hammered out with a
blunt screwdriver. There are a couple dents in the inside ring from this
process. All of the rollers move freely. First question, why would the seal
suddenly leak grease into the drum? I didn't tamper with the seal while
re-packing a few weeks ago, and at that time there wasn't a lick of grease
inside.  When I hammered out the inner bearing, the seal kinda got wavy.
It's not a very pliable material, but it doesn't appear to be dry rotted.
The seal has a VW stamp and part number, it's bluish in color and I imagine
it's pretty old. Here are my main concerns:
Do I have to replace the brake pads or will a thorough cleaning be ok?
Does this happen often during repacking? It sucks! This wasn't a problem
before I decided to go and fix what wasn't broken. I have terrible luck with
preventive maintenance :-(
Do I have to replace the bearings...especially the inner one I dented during
removal?
How do you guys pack bearings so this doesn't happen, and what type of wheel
bearing grease should I use?

I'm so bummed...I enjoy every minute I spend in my truck. Now it's sitting
in the back yard and it's my fault.

Thanks in advance for the advise.

-Tom
