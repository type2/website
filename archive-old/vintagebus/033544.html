&lt;&lt; Is there an advantage or disadvantage to using the big nut RGBs over the 
 small nut variety?  &gt;&gt;

And I say much more expensive, much harder to change, lower bearings.  But 
then, if you're going for speed...

Also, I never put the big brakes on the rear without replacing the front 
beam, which gives you the bigger front brakes and the sway bar.  And then, 
how about a 1776...
(This is not a criticism, just an observation.)  I'm building a 1776 myself.  
For my 3.88...  But one of my busses is stock, 6V, 40 horse, etc.  Talk about 
rambling on...
