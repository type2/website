&gt; The only way to get any coating to with stand the rigors of the mother

I've been kind of studying the two at where I used to live where I use
both types of stuff on window frames, doors and decks at 7500 feet.  The
polyurethane is a mess after two years, and you have to re-sand, clean it
up.  This includes polyurethane marine spar varnish.  The oil goes away,
but you can just throw another coat on it.  With new wood, they usually
say to let it weather for six months or so or it won't take the oil
well.  I've found a product called Penofin to be the best lasting.  It
doesn't come in a clear color, so that may be a problem for some, but it
lasts better than any product I have tried so far and has some little tiny
reflective stuff in it, but you can't see it.
