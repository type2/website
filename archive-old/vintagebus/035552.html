To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just returned from 2000+ mile trip, Los Angeles to Portland Oregon, and back, 
in my '67 double-cab.  Rained cats and dogs all the way up, but &quot;Toby&quot; never 
missed a beat.  I'm a couple of MPH slow for the 16-wheelers in flat 
country--I like a hundred &quot;clicks,&quot; they like 70MPH--but no one seemed to 
mind much.  The dual-port 1776 with a aBocar 34 PICT 3 and oversized jets is 
about as perfect a combination as I've ever driven.  Soon as I get some hoops 
and canvas, I'm thinking East Coast and back!
