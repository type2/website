Subject: I have brakes, just no lights!

Volks,

I'm facing two problems: 1) Only my Juno email is working (so I can't get
on the archives) 2) I have no brake lights.

1)  Juno can be easily fixed: Quit using it and pay some money for my
access.  The free stuff always has a price.

2)  Any immediate help here would be so much appreciated: Gretchen's
horn, turn signals and brake lights are not working.  I don't think the
gas gauge is working, but it really never does anyway, so may not be
related.  I checked the fuses at the block under the parcel shelf,
they're all OK.  The block had pushed out of the metal holder a little,
but all the wires were attached.  It really all looks good under there.  

Help me!  Please!  Is there another block somewhere?  Can I just close
the windows and reboot?  Oh, nevermind that's the Juno problem.
