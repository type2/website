Subject: Headlight switch

So I was able to fix my headlight switch.   I found some sheet copper and
cut it to approximately the size of the broken switch prongs- then I laid
them on a piece of wood and used a wood punch to make the little dents that
the prongs should have - 2 of the 4 were broken.   I cleaned everything
really well and clamped the manufactured pieces on to the broken off pieces
and solder them together.  Then I just bent em into shape-  Works great -
woo hoo!
