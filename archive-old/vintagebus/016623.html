Happy Friday all,

All this talk about headlights leads me to share an experience I had last 
weekend.

Took out my drivers side bucket to clean it up and try to reposition it in 
the clips (my adjuster screws are tweaked) to no avail.  Upon attempting to 
reattach the parking amber light to the screw noticed I lost the screw!  
There is another screw below where it was attached, not knowing the 
electical status of the connection I used that screw for the oringinal 
place.  Everything seemed fine. Later that night my girlfriend, my dog, and 
myself are on the way to a place to camp and twilight hits so I FIRE up the 
driving lights....about 1 minute later my parcel tray is a smoke screen!  In 
a state of panic I immediately kill the ignition slowly coast to stop yank 
my shady hooked up head unit while my girlfriend jumps out onto the shoulder 
at about 5mph (apparently she was in much more of a state of panic the I 
was).  I'm holding my breath due to toxic smoke and trouble shooting my PO 
shadtree speghetti system while Erin says your headlight is smokey.  Take a 
look and that wire to the driving light fried all the way up.  I quess I 
bridged those two screw conections!  Any way just thought I share this 
experience.  Amazing how much smoke and nasty fumes a foot of wire housing 
can make!
