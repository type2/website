Subject: Re: [VB] coil specs

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;Can someone enlighten me on what all connects to the hot side of the coil on
&gt;a 73 type 1 DP ghia engine in my deluxe?  I replaced a melted coil and fixed
&gt;some wires to find one hot wire that fell off and seems to short to go
&gt;anywhere.  My battery was pretty dead and finally got my bus running with a
&gt;jump from my GTi but it ran rough! Seemed like mayby lacking a cylinder.
&gt;Took the jumper cables off and it died before I could hit the throttle,
&gt;couldn't get him to run after that.
&gt;
&gt;The original wires to the coil were shady and I think the hot ones were
&gt;grounding out...could this melt a coil?


Negative side goes to the condensor on the distributor.

Positive side is supplied by the ignition switch.  Often there is also a
connection to the idle solenoid and the electric choke on the carberator.
