Monday morning when I got to work, Michelle (the secretary) said, &quot;Hey
Erin - I saw a VW van go thru town this weekend!&quot;  After querying her more,
I was able to gather it was a light colored bus with a headlight out but
that was all she knew.  I wondered who they were and what they were doing up
around here in this busless country.

Later that afternoon at work, 2 guys in overalls come up to me in the yard
at work and say, &quot;Hey are you Erin the VW guy?&quot; :-)

It turns out that Jim Beardman from Sacremento, CA and his buddy Gary are
here with Union Pacific Railroad, helping to pull and install new rails.
They left back in March in their topless 69 Westy with plexiglas roof and
have been on the road ever since, being flown back a couple of times to be
with their families.  They started in Nevada, progressed to Arizona, then to
Wyoming and now here.  They found me by talking to Will at the local
Autozone which is just around the corner.


Anyway, here we were, 3 guys about the same age, all in overalls, walking
around looking at each other's busses - I felt like I was triplet!  We
agreed to meet up with each other after work and about dusk we met in the
local KMart parking lot.  Aha!  They had a headlight out so I knew that I
had met the guys that Michelle spoke of.  After mentioning to Jim that his
headlight was out, we scurried over to Autozone to pick one up and then I
helped them install it out in the parking lot.  They were both hungry about
this time and I had an errand to run so we departed.  I got their names and
addresses primarily because Jim really loves my spinner knob.  They are
banned in California and he wants one as they grow on trees out here.  I
ordered one from Albert Fish and he has kindly 2nd day'd one here for these
guys.

This noon at work i got a call from Jim stating that his bus was flooded
really bad, wouldn't start, and he had to find an alternative ride to work.
I told him I would meet him at the motel after work and so I did.  This
engine is a Mexican case breed and is one of the cleanest engines I've seen.
It's a bone stock 1600DP.  The valves are right in adjustment but the darn
thing was running terrible rich.  We decided to go get some supper and then
I'd work on the engine afterwards.  When we got back, the guys were tired
after having had to walk about 6 to 9 miles with their rail duties so I told
them to leave the keys and I'd take care of the problem.  The engine ran
like crap and flooded out really bad.  It took me a while to figure it out
but I took the top off the carb, came home, and proceeded to install a good
used needle seat with a thicker washer under it than what they had had on
the carb.  This lowered the float level some.  I also had to make a new
gasket as I didn't have any 34-pict-3 gaskets laying around.  I checked the
valved -everything was okay except the #4 intake was tight.  The engine
still ran like crap.  Then I decided against my better wishes to monkey with
the large adjusting screw on the carb.  My gosh!  The thing was turned out
aout 8 times.  This screw should NEVER be turned out more than a half of
turn max.  I turned it to a half turn, did some more tweaking and the Westy
runs like a top.  I test drove it around the lot and then I cleaned up the
plugs, picked up the tools, and came home.

These guys are a laugh a minute - I'm glad to have met them - I was spitting
out my food at supper time cause I was laughing so hard...
