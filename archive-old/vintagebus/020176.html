ok heres the scoop....

i have a new mexico 1600dp with a type 4 oil cooler.
when i put oil in 2.5 quarts filled it to the top mark.
i have a gene berg dip stick sensor. i coldent drive 
more than 5 miles without the light coming on.

now all my tin is correctly installed all my seals are 
in place. my timing is set a 7.5 btc. nothing is in my 
fan either, now here are my questions.

1. since i have a bigger oil cooler should i pour in 
more oil? and if so how much more?

2.if i have to put in more oil should i just put in a 
deep sump?

3.since its a 59. type 2 and it originaly had a 40 horse
the vents on the side arent big enough?

4. if the vents arent big enough should i put in air 
scoops?

oh and it was a about 90-95 degrees f. outside but i 
wasnt able to go more than 3-5 miles.

thanks,
nick aragon
