For those attending the VW Classic this year EMPI has taken over as a major
sponser (replaceing WCM), the news is for you toy bus collectors is that
EMPI is producing a Limited Edition Johnney Lightning Bus for this event.
They will only be available at the Classic so I guess they are trying to get
more people to attend? Even though this is a Hole show I was informed that
the Original Rich Kimbal (?) is still at the reins and is going to try to
keep it the same as it's always been.
