Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad? &gt;Photos sell too!

Consider uploading one picture to TheSamba and the rest to your home page and 
provide a link. 

  -Harry in Fresno

&gt; Sellers of vehicles and other items that are to be posted on the internet need
&gt; to pay attn to the size and optimization of the photos that they include with
&gt; the ads. Not everyone has cable or DSL! At 28.8kb or what I was getting last
&gt; night (21.4kb!!!!) large photos with distinct color shifting can discourage
&gt; potential customers. Sellers should not expect *Bay or theSAMBA to fix your ad.
