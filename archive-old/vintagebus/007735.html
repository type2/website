Al et al,

&gt;Yes, my 69 double cab has one, the only one I've ever seen. I don't know
&gt;if other years had them or not. The double cab was a relatively
&gt;unmolested 1 owner when I got it in 86.

&gt;69 double cab

Our 1969 was also a one owner bus when we purchased it. The original owner
had it for 29 years before he passed it on to us. It is in surprisingly
original shape. The 211 721 652A was discovered under the floor mat but not
installed in its proper position. I found it while doing a comparison of the
accel pedal in the '72 which has somehow twisted to the right and has no
spring or circlip.

&gt;why dont you just get a rpm limiter rotor

I reinstalled the 211 721 652A on the bus before I drove it to work this
morning. I dont think it was there to act a governing device but instead to
limit strain on the throttle linkage at the carb. I will say that it takes a
bit of getting used to especially on those frantic on-ramp mergers where
keeping the pedal to metal gives me that false sense of speed that inspires
confidence v :)&gt;

Thanks to all that responded!!!!!

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; That is about where I found it. I would guess it keeps you pressing the
&gt;&gt; pedal too far down. Have not noticed this on other buses. Anybody else
have
&gt;&gt; one?
