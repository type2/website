To All:

In the recent past one of my spies :-) forwarded a message about gear ratios
and modified trannies.  He said it was currently a very hot topic on the
Mailing List and asked if I'd care to comment.  

I told him no.

Today, he forwarded a message asking about tire diameters and wondered if this
was why I hadn't made any comment about the earlier gear ratio discussion.

The best answer to both of these topics is that there is no single correct
answer.  Instead, you get a range of answers, each of which is correct for a
given set of factors.

Take tire diameter, for example.  Go out and measure the diameter of your
spare tire. Now pull a rear hub cap and measure the distance from the center
of the axle to the ground, which should be the RADIUS of your tire.  

But it's not.  It's what's called the 'effective radius'.  And it will change.

If laid your spare on the ground and let out all the air, are it's diameter
will hardly change at all.  But do the same thing to one of your rear tires
and the weight of the vehicle will mass it flat, reducing the effective
radius.  This illustrates the two main factors in effective wheel diameter:
inflation pressure and the amount of load the wheel must bear.  But people
often overlook the obverse -- LIGHTEN the load and the effective radius of
your tire will change.  

Hitting a bump in the road can do both(!)  First it increases your load, then
it lightens it.  Depending on the type of tires you're using, some or all of
these transient variations in effective wheel radius will be seen by your
suspension system.

The diameter of your wheel also changes due to wear.  Tread depth of 3/8&quot; or
more is not uncommon on light truck tires.  Wear away 3/8&quot; of tread and  your
tire's diameter is reduced by three-quarters of an inch.

So what's your tire's diameter?  I've no idea.  Go measure it... if you think
it's important.  But the diameter of an unmounted tire is a factor out of
context.  If you are interested in the performance of your vehicle you should
be more concerned with the effective wheel radius, and understand that radius
changes according to inflation pressure, vehicle weight, tread wear, tire
design and road surface conditions.  (Speed is also a factor in effective
wheel radius... but not with regard to VW buses :-)

The same is generally true for any discussion of powertrain gear ratios.
While the mechanical gear ratio is a fixed numerical quantity, it is only one
factor in the equation and can not be intelligently discussed unless a host of
other factors are included.  

When you have this sort of multi-factor equation you will always have have a
range of 'correct' answers.  To achieve what's best in your particular case
you must first define your particular set of factors, then operate the vehicle
in a manner that insures you'll hit close to your goal.  For some, that goal
is to go zipping down the freeway at seventy miles an hour, for others it may
be delivering a ton of cargo to a mountain top.  People who must arrive
someplace quickly and on time will have a completely different set of factors
than those who are happy to arrive at all :-)

This invariably leads to which tire is 'best', begging the question 'Best for
what?'  The archives are hip-deep with 'best-tire' profundities which, no
surprise, will tell you the 'best' tire for a smooth ride to the store may not
be the best tire for hauling cargo in the wilderness.
