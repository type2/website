Subject: camper interior needed in the worst way!!
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 2000 21:32:46 -0400

I'm looking for a camper interior for my 64 sundial.  Does not need to be a
sundial interior.  My wife is making me sell my 72 westy to make room for my
other projects and I cant get through a summer without my camping
weekends!!! :(  Unfortunately Im on the east coast so the seller would
probably have to ship .  Im willing to pay!!!  any condition, any year that
will fit.

If anyone is looking for more info on the Busses by the Sea campout in
Maryland, please email me.
