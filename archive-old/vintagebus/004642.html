&gt; I like the round ones because they look way cool.  But, i wonder how well
&gt; you can see to the rear with em. I have a 61 and i plan to drive it a
&gt; lot.  It has the small rear window so the mirrors may well be an important
&gt; tool.
&gt;

The Westfailure has the round ones. In pulling buses around Los Angeles
freeways during rush hour and such I have found them to be adequate. Not to
say about a square foot of mirror wouldn't be nice, but when driving a combo
bus of about 35 feet in length in El Lay traffic, I find it
counterproductive to actually wait until I see an opening. I start moving
and the Honda's get out of the way. They don't even honk unless I am rude
enough to use my turn signal. They don't like that. YMMV
