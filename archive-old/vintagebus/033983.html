Hey,

I got my '64 Standard with a hacked FI 1600 in it.

After ungrafting all the FI stuff, I need to know where
certain wires go.

I looked at Thom's wiring diagram and I can use it if
I debug the system myself with a voltmeter.  But the
colors don't match up.

I have a solid green wire, a solid gray wire, a solid blue
wire that come directly out of the harness that I don't know
where they go.  While I can find the blue on Thoms, I can't
seem to find the others.  All of these are in the engine 
compartment and all of them are correct from the harness.

Anyone help out here?

Is there a special way I need to read the wiring diagrams?
