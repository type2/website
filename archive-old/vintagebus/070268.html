Subject: Pop out window frames

Howdy,

I am replacing my rusted beyond repair pop out window frames on my '66
Deluxe with new units from Wolfgang.  Since they are bare metal, has anyone
powder coated these before installing seals and glass, or should they just
be painted the old fashioned way?  Thanks for any and all advice.
