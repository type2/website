Subject: RE: [VB] Oxyclean on Westy tents and Pickup canvas

Ask Vanbondo about cleaning tents...

Keywords: VINTAGE, IRREPLACEABLE, CAUTION, GENTLY!

Cleaning of Tents and/or Truck Tilt canvas should be approached circumspectly.
Thats a fancy way of saying &quot;Take it easy!!!!&quot;

I recommend soap and water with a soft sponge, careful rinse and air dry.
Woolite might also be advisable.

What makes me the authority?

- I attacked a Single cab tilt with bleach and scrub brushes. Hot water and
soapy mixture. Unfortunately, the stitching was weaken and the canvas
unassembled itself on I-10 en route to the 1995(?) SOTO/Classic Weekend.

- Mrs. Vanbondo attempted to &quot;clean&quot; a nearly mint Sundail California
Awning-like tent. The tent has minor mildew stains. The unfortunate choice of
cleaning items included a 3M scrubby pad that beat the heck out of the silk
screened red stripes. When completed the tent looked appropriately &quot;worn&quot;. The
mildew remained.

- Have seen tents that have been scrubbed and/or put in a commercial drier.
Results were large areas of discoloration, stresses on 35 years old seams and
exaggeration of what were previously pin holes. Shrinkage caused by machine
drying may/may not be a factor- but WHY risk it?
