Subject: re Buses as an investment??
Message-ID: &lt;375723AB.326D6B87_at_bellatlantic_dot_net&gt;

Okay. . . maybe we shouldn't concider our busses as investments. Just
the same, I read in VolksWorld magazine that Jerry Seindeld bought a bus
&gt;from some dooooood. And the dooooooood didnt wanna sell, but Mr.
Seinfeld was &quot;very persuasive&quot;. Seems to me it's a hobby that may have a
financial aside.

Anyways. . . I also have heard that Julia Roberts has a splitty. Can
anyone tell us of other celebrity busnuts??

Better yet, if you know of a celebrity such as Jerry with fistfulls of
persuasion, send em my way :) !!!!
