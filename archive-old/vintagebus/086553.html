&gt; I then took that [leaky] pump off and put on a new Bosch fuel pump...same
&gt; problem.

My first thought is that you need to try another fuel pump - it's
possible to get a bad one new in the box, or a pump with 250,000 miles
on it cleaned up and stuck in a new box and sold as &quot;NOS&quot; on eBarf.

Another thing that might be happening is that the float valve in the
carb is sticking closed.  If the Bus runs normally apart from the
leaking fuel, this may not be happening.  One way to tell: Take off the
line from the tank to the pump and pinch or plug it closed really well
so it can't leak fuel.  Then run the engine until it dies from lack of
fuel.  Try blowing into the fuel inlet pipe on the carburetor - this
should be easy and you should hear your breath blowing inside the float
bowl.  If this doesn't happen, take the top part of the carb off and
figure out why the valve is stuck shut.

It also could be that the rubber hose from the pump to the carb is
blocked.  Take it off and blow through it, or just replace it if it's
more than a couple of years old.
