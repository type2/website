Subject: Dead Hole

Here is my problem...........

I needed a motor for my Crew and a buddy wanted a NEW engine
installed and some other work on his bus done so we worked a
trade. I do the work, I get the &quot;old&quot; engine. I knew the engine
wasn't firing on #3 and before I pulled it out and I thought I
knew what it was either, adjust the valves, or a cracked head.
Well it was neither.

Here's some background. The engine is a 1641cc with 36mm Dual
throat Dellortos, stock valves, 009 dist and other than the dead
hole it ran fine. When the valves checked out ok, so I ASSumed
it was the head.  So I tore it down so I could replace it. Well
when I pulled the head off and cleaned it, no crack!! So now I'm
stumped. Why would it not fire on that one cylinder??? I checked
the plug wires they were all good. Put gas in the combustion
camber of the head overnight to see if there was a crack I wasn't
seeing it but it was at the same level next day. My only thought
is the carbs........is it possible that the #3 &quot;throat&quot; isn't
supplying gas? When I asked when he noticed it was dead he said
he was &quot;gettin on it&quot; and it just lost power so he drove it home
on 3 and parked it, and has been that way ever since (3 years).
Bad rings? bad plug? Remember all the other cylinders are firing
Any input would be appreciated.................

Thanks,
Greg
