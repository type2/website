Once again I currently support Johns efforts and
obvious talent. Formerly, in the heated debate about
the DD Deluxe Barndoor panel I was one of the guys who
were strongly bagging on him *at that time*
specifically for asking $10,000.00 while it was in
it's former condition. Inever indicated that it was a
&quot;worthless POS&quot;. I just figured that it was common
sense in a realistic post dot com lay-off riddled
economy that an incompleted project would not be
&quot;worth&quot; $10k AT THAT TIME. I strongly encouraged
completing the bee-otch as John has continued to do.
For his sake and ours I'm totally happy that he has
taken the opportunity of make this a showcase of his
talent. Selling the bus as it was for $10k was in my
mind simply pumping the market. By finishing the thing
it has the potential to be worth far more than the
previously asked price plus is GREAT
advertisement/public relations to generate tons of
future business.
YES, un-catagorically, YES- I now believe that will
command or could command a price higher than $10k if
John chose to sell it once it is completed.

It is a matter of reality versus emotions the ability
to determine sh*t from Shinola and a primer bus from a
premier bus.

In the past six months I have sold a bus, now drive a
non-vw and continue to fade from the scene as I can no
longer afford splitties primarily due to the over
inflated perceived valuation of the remaining dreggs
of the available split buses and ever increasing cost
of basics like 34-3 PICT carbs, raw engine cases and
all of the other billion parts. &lt;Frankly, I personally
can't afford it any longer!&gt; 
My interest and love of the beasts remains as strong
as ever but the scene &quot;ain't&quot; the same. As soon as I
see a bus that turns my crank, which is in decent
shape and at a price that I can dream of affording I
will be right back into the mix and into the driver's
seat. In the meantime, I must lay back and encourage
creativity and craftsmanship which John Jones has
exhibited. 
I do *not* support over pricing-hyper inflating the
&quot;value&quot; of rusted bondoed sawzall candidates as are
regularly marketed on the popular sites. I *DO*
support the continued marketing of high quality OG and
restored/properly refurbished inventory such as seen
on the same sites. Quality should command quality
price. Poop should not be confused with a Popcycle
Fudgebar. Anyone who defends selling poop at a premier
price has something to defend and is not being honest
with me or themselves.

To clarify- I am **NOT** calling the DD Barndoor Panel
Deluxe poop. It is looking excellent at this stage. I
support and embrace the creativity and craftsmanship
as presented. I actually restarted this flamebait
debate to draw MORE attention to the project. If I
come across as a lightning rod for rough comments and
causes you as a reader to get more involved in your
tastes and opinions then thats OK by me. It gets you
back into focusing on your project. Perhaps you might
need to order a part or twelve from quality folks like
Ronnie or your local parts vendor.
Hurray for John and his quality efforts! Thanks to
people like Ronnie who are providing formerly
impossible to find parts and products. =)
Go do -your- thing. Can you out do John Jones? Prove
it...
Best regards,
Jim Ellis
