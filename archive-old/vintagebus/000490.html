Hi Steven,
Hmm, we have never found a problem installing the 40HP (1200cc) and later 
cranks.flywheels together either 6 volt or 12 volt.  The only somewhat 
special parts are in early 40HP there is a slightly smaller area on the front 
end of the crank, and a ring cut into the inside bore of the flywheel for the 
O-ring to fit properly.  After all 40HP and later engines used the same 
diameter and part numbers main crank bearings.  Eric&amp;Barb
