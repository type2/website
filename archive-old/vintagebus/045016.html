Subject: Price for Mint Ambulance Fans
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A girl in my little farming town just bought a 58 kombi.  The bus is solid 
and complete.  It even has the rear bumper splash pans!  Anyway, I happened 
to notice that she has ambulance fans and after close inspection they were 
indeed and in mint condition to boot!  I told her that they would make a 
perfect addition to the 57 deluxe and she agreed to sell me them.  Now I told 
her I'll give her my cover so she still has something there but I could not 
decide on a price.  She knows absolutely nothing about the prices for such 
parts.  I just need to know a low reasnable price that we would both be hapy 
with.  Im not interested in taking advantage of another Bus enthusiast.
