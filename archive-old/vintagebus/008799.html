OK, I'd say Japanese and Englishman should consider themselves lucky.......
I bought my 65 and am working on it right now to restore as much as I can
before I leave this country (this beautiful US of A), probably for good in
Spring, next year and was thinking about taking my 65 with...... problem is
I just found out that I can't take it with me. There is a ban on importing
vehicles that are older than 10 years..... no exceptions.....

Just me,

&gt; http://www.oldcars.co.jp/ is the major one I know about.
&gt;
&gt; I have seen pictures &quot;stolen&quot; from eBay or my site for Buses that have
been
&gt; purchased by them.
&gt;
&gt; I do not think it is true that cars cannot be brought back because:
&gt; 1. That sounds like propaganda and
&gt; 2. I heard mention a year or two ago of someone buying a VW from a
Japanese
&gt; seller to brought to the USA.
&gt;
&gt; I'm afraid of anyone with a briefcase at a show, money or not.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Everett
