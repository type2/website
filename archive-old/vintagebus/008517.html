Subject: Shift Coupler Replacement
Date: Thu, 7 Sep 2000 23:03:15 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I recently broke the shift coupler on my '66 Westy. I was able to remove the
two halves of the broken coupler pretty easily, the square-headed screws
came loose with a lot of WD-40 and some gentle coaxing, I didn't want to
pull the heads off of the screws, so after I removed the lockwires I
patiently worked them out by soaking and gently twisting with vise-grips.

Now that I'm ready to install the new coupler, I can't get the rear shift
rod and the inner selector shaft that runs from the transmission far enough
apart to fit the new coupler in.
I removed the gear selector and spring but can't get the shift rods any
further forward as they are bumping against the frame member which holds the
inner shift rod in place.
 What's the best way to get this new coupler in position?
I searched the archives and looked in the Type 2 Library and my Bentley
manual but found no advice.
I'd appreciate any advice.
Thanks in advance
John Flowers
