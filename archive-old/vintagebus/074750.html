Subject: [VB] Tranny question/ driveshaft play

Hey all-
about how much play should i have in the driveshaft on my tranny? Mine has 
about 1/4 inch of play in any direction, but it shift into all gears. is 
this enough info to determine if the tranny is good? If not does anyone want 
to sell a 12V tranny to go in a 66 bus? I wouldnt need the axles, nose cone 
or red boxes. Im looking for something around $50 plus whatever it costs to 
ship it via greyhound to idaho
Thanks a bunch,
Kelly
