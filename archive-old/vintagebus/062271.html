Subject: [VB] The &quot;Brown Stuff&quot;



Hi all. I  am trying to refurbish a brake light 
decklid bulbholder, and the license light part is broken. It's some kind of 
&quot;brown stuff&quot;, not quite a natural product, not quite plastic. It's riveted
to 
the rest of the assembly, and the terminal that hold the bulb are also
riveted 
to the &quot;brown stuff&quot;. I think I remember someone a while back saying what
this 
product was. It's almost like the stuff they make circuit borads out of? 
Regardless, I'd like to know where I may be able to get some of the 
&quot;stuff&quot;, and what it is called or made of.

Thanks.

I have seen it replaced with a piece of phenolic. It is relatively heat
resistant, hard, and easily workable.
