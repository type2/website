&gt; &gt;   Yes what a total fluff job that was. I dont
&gt; necesarily think vw should
&gt; &gt; pump out parts for beetles either so the premise
&gt; was kinda flawed but overal
&gt; &gt; it was a joke of an article. (btw, toyota made not
&gt; 1 part for my 1969
&gt; &gt; corona, nor did i expect them to). If anyone goes
&gt; to any chevy drag races
&gt; &gt; (guilty), how many people there are selling shirts
&gt; with a picture or a chevy
&gt; &gt; logo on them? Does this somehow devalue the mark?
&gt; I just dont see it. I hate
&gt; &gt; this topic, i hate VW for it and their fluff job
&gt; of an interview on it
&gt; &gt; really didnt answer any questions but rather made
&gt; them look even more
&gt; &gt; foolish for 'yea we know it irritates people, our
&gt; lawyers are big bad guys,
&gt; &gt; vw germany says its ok, we are doing it anyways'.
&gt; They are 100% completely
&gt; &gt; wrong on the fact that we are just old vw
&gt; enthusiasts as well. If they
&gt; &gt; looked into it Id bet they find out probably 50%
&gt; of bug people have had or
&gt; &gt; will have a new one sooner or later. This is
&gt; probably quite a higher
&gt; &gt; percentage of 'regular' car people that will ever
&gt; have a vw, nothing to
&gt; &gt; stifle. I have had a new one, I will never again,
&gt; thats a given. Anyways bad
&gt; &gt; topic, just makes you want to set up a vw punching
&gt; bag and go to town on
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; My next new car (actually to replace my wife's
&gt; beetle which is headed for
&gt; restoration) will probably be a Honda.  It certainly
&gt; will not be a VW.
&gt; Honda currently occupies the same place in the
&gt; automotive heirarchy that
&gt; VW did in the aircooled era, with decent reliable
&gt; cars.  VW went away from
&gt; that except in exterior shapes.  The question is,
&gt; how long will nostalgia
&gt; sell cars for VW?
