Subject: RE: [VB] Trip report: Yosemite, etc.

The sender is in the rear at the bottom, where the oil pressure relief
valve (usually) is. I have an external oil cooler &amp; filter.  I'm not
sure what's inside.  It sounds like my gear ratio is the same as yours.

I'll check the calibration this weekend with boiling water.  Are the
gauges adjustable (calibration)? Thanks for sharing your experience with
temps.  I never know what &quot;average&quot; is, but it seems like we are reading
from the same place for the sender.  According to my (VDO) gauge, I
average 180 +/- 5, except when it's running hard or in hot weather, when
it gets up to 210.  This is about the same as my prior '71 Westy (with
sender on sump), except that it heated up a little faster.

I was talking with a VW mechanic who felt that a big part of how hot it
runs at higher speeds was dependent on how well the engine is balanced.
With good balance, there is less friction because everything spins
easier.  One theory.

Do you have a dual relief case and if so then the point that you have 
the sender is near the rear of the bus on the bottom???
Have you calibrated your sender / gauge with ??? we used boiling water 
corrected for altitude.
What type of cooling do you have doghouse, type 4, external,???
Our temp sender is at the relief to the rear and 225 degrees is good 
because it wants to go higher and we do about 50 mph at about 3200 rpm.
