        As long as were talking suspensions, I would like to ask if
anybody has experience with
the m-code 531, which is a stiffer rear suspension.This option is in my
'64 westy and I
think this is why my kidneys are going at a &quot;young&quot; age.No it's not that
bad but I would like to soften the rear end a little.Would a &quot;harder
&quot;shock help elevate the stiffness or a &quot;softer&quot; shock ?Has anybody mixed
types of shocks front and back?I first thought a softer shock and that's
why I installed the Gr2's, but now I am thinking the gas charged KYB's.
                Thanks in advance,
                                    woody
