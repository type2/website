Subject: Re: [VB] Speedometer 

Hi AZ,
If you are not worried about the year and even month the speedo was made,  
and just need something that looks right and works right.  The 1961-63 bus  
speedo will fit that.
  Try Thesamba_dot_com for the &quot;Classifieds&quot; there and do a &quot;Search&quot; for  
&quot;Speedometer&quot; &amp; &quot;Speedo&quot;.  Also remember that VW since 1955 changed  model years at 
or near the beginning of AUG.  So say a 10.60 stamped speedo  will be for a 
1961.
  There is also a fellow who advertises speedometer repair.
  BTW make sure to check out the &quot;Trip Speedometers&quot;!!
