Subject: i finally got a bus!!!!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i got a 1960 single cab about one year ago 
i love it but its not a bus ya know? today i went
to an auto auction and i picked up a 1959 kombi for
75.00$$$ do you belive that 75 bucks!!!!!
it blew my mind its got rust in the normal places
but nothing that cant be fixed , the brakes work,
the engine wont turn over i think the batt. is dead
i belive the last owner had electrical problems
becouse every electrical device in the engine bay
is sparkely brand new and the batt is dead?
i think something is gounded or shorted.but who cares i got a bus!!!!!!!
