Glynn, David, and others,

I guess the List gurus got sidetracked in addressing your spare gas can
question, or maybe they just got tired of discussing this, but some of
them have added four gallons to their fuel capacity by using the 14.7
gal. tank from an early '70's Bus. No cans on the roof. Easy swap.

Drawbacks: gotta pull the engine to install it. You also have to extend
the straps that hold the tank down and mess with the filler neck a bit,
but it's an easy job.

Check the Archives around Aug. '97 under &quot;Type 2 gas tank swap&quot;

I just got a tank out of a '72 Bus and it's tight, but it definitely
fits in my '65. Still have to finish the straps- I'm using the set from
the donor junkyard loaf. Couple of easy welds and it should look like a
factory job.

p-mail me if you would like more info. I saved it all somewhere.

Good luck,

Dave

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; I could do with some opinions on carrying fuel.
&gt; 
&gt; i'm off on some trips, and as i don't have either my tap working right or a
&gt; fuel gauge yet.. i'm thinking of taking a gallon can along with me.
