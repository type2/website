Subject: Re:  [VB] Rear Seat Side Bracket?
To: csullivan_at_oceanit_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Here's another one- what the heck does the bracket look like that
attaches the rear seat to anything.  I suspect it only attaches at the
sides.  But all of the hardware is gone, just some impressions of what
might have been...
-----
it is an L shaped piece of metal   not too big.   the foot of the L has a 
hole drilled in it for attaching the bracket to the side of the bus.  The 
long end has two holes drill in it to attach the bracket to the seat.    
There are thread holes in the side of the eat, and in the back off the back 
seat.    You could make a bracket  yourself.  yup.  no big deal.
