Subject: Jerome report---kinda longish

Well,  I guess I'll toss spew my thoughts on the weekend.
Pulled up to the house about 6 tonite....9 hours on the road.  Had a great 
trip,  actually made a whole vacation out of it.
Left for Sedona on Weds.....got to Jerome Fri afternoon with the wife and 
daughter.  Set up camp and said hey to John and Ronnie....and all the other 
folks....chuckled at Rich and his clutch cable.   The 63 purred like a kitten 
there and back.....23 mpg, fully loaded, crap on the rack and a couple of 
passengers.
Didnt win crap in the raffle....watched John hog all the prizes (bastard)  
and watched Phil win the bus....(bastard...that was mine)   Actually had just 
met Phil on Sat playin horseshoes with Rich and the other VTO fellas.
Was definately mellow this year....slept like a log both nights.
Hung out with some Vegas buddies I hadnt seen in a couple of years...met and 
saw some listees.  Sam, Roger, Bart, Aaron, JP....and all the regulars.  Glad 
to see Bart made it home Ok.  Cant wait to see the Sundial with paint.

A lot of nice busses this year......the quality seems to be gettin better and 
better each  year.  Some beautiful drivers out there.  

Anyways...I'll stop the spew.....We had a great weekend/vacation and glad to 
be home.
