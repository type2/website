Well, it's still around, so unless it had kittens... :-)

A clog seems most likely, I was unable to find any rust holes or feel any
heat venting from the tubes at any point.  I will try blowing out with the

Now all I have to do is get the clutch to disengage (sigh) and I'm all set!
 800+ mile trip to Cleveland coming up this Thursday for the next school
year...
