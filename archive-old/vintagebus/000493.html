Thom,
I have a 1961 SO-34 which doen not have an ABCD code on it.  It's the one 
that inspired PLF Dawn to get hers after our show Busses and Balloons in 
Albuquerque in October.  It is a sub-hatch, flip seat European model Westy 
with all four tent brackets on top, and originally had a gasoline heater.  
Here is a transcription of the m-code plate.

04 05 1
347 367 119 139 150
231 SK 1023 773959

Hope this is of some help - don't know why it doesn't have the other 
designation.

JP
