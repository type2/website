In a message dated 98-12-03 14:18:55 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; When chasing threads, try it by hand first.
 And I do mean by hand, fingers on tap/die.
 Let the existing threads guide you.
 If it takes more than finger pressure, caution.
 You may be starting a new set of threads, could get nasty.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
You could also be changing the fit of the threaded part and setting it up to
vibrate loose.  So if you notice that the tap or die are cutting more metal
off of the part it might be redoing the fit it too much.  Had this happen at a
factory I (Eric) worked at.  There was a part threaded into a leg of a very
tall personal lifting machine that was being manufatured for getting to high
areas of construction and were sold worldwide.  Unfortunitly this part was
vibrating loose and out of the leg.  Which allowed the legs to fall out of
thier sockets and down would fall the lift, when the pressure shifted to that
side again.  I went to the tooling shop that did the production work on the
new machines and they did not understand the meaning of a threaded fit.  Had
to bring my Machinist Handbook the next day and show them the chapter on taps
and dies.  Soon afterward taps of the proper fit were issued to the factory
workers and the lifts stopped loosing thier parts due to both vibration and
the looseness of the threads.

PS You would do better by buying HSS (High Speed Steel) taps and dies.  They
last much longer, and cut even harder material.  Plus if you do break the taps
off in a hole you can shatter them into easely removable bits and pieces.
Even though they are more expensive they will out last any of the other type
of manufacture of threading tools.  EEE&amp;B
