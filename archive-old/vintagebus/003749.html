Hi All,

Had fun this weekend working on the 59 double cab.... did some work, took
some more photos, updated several of my web pages including the front beam
page, bolts, empi parts, blown 36hp okrasa kit, etc. etc.  Go to:
http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/59dc.htm


My 6 year old likes ISpy pictures so I thought I would make one out of bus
bits.  Try your luck!

You can also start at:
http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com\davem\myvws.htm and the follow the links all
over the place.
Many find http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com\davem\partpage.htm to be a good start.


Enjoy!!!

David
