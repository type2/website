Diane has explained by pmail that a &quot;broken engine mount&quot;
which &quot;cracked the block&quot; on her  * 67 splitty may have happened
around the same time a &quot;quality&quot; repair shop replaced the
clutch cable after tightening  it &quot;failed&quot; and she heard a definite
&quot;clunk&quot; when shifting,combined with a possible oil leak in the
rear main seal area on a new engine installation which caused
the shop to remove the engine and discover some sort of damage.
We may expect to view photos of the damage shortly, but
in the interim, would anybody care to venture a guess
what happened, and what is actually broken ?
Do you see anything wrong here ??
...and the winner is ...???

excerpted comments:
&gt;They pulled the engine because they thought the oil was coming from the
rear main seal.  &gt;What upsets me is, when I heard the VERY FIRST CLUNK .. I
pointed it out.  Everyone at &gt;the shop heard &quot;nothing&quot; and the owner said
&quot;don't worry, it is an OLD bus ...blah blah .. &quot;

&gt;He never admitted to a broken motor mount.  What he said was, &quot;the way VW
bus engines &gt;sit under the hood blah blah blah .. that this is a common
problem [cracked block] ... &quot; [my 71 never had this sort of problem.   is it
just common on older buses ??? or 67's ??? but this &gt;is not an old worn
engine .. this is a new one.  rebuilt of course.]  He said and I quote [not
&gt;word for word] &quot; There is no need to be upset .. don't go telling your
husband and friends .. &gt;blah blah .. this is a common thing .. blah blah ..
we will NOT repair the block, we will put &gt;your engine [parts I guess] in a
NEW [used - restored] block.&quot;

&gt;Thing is .. I don't know if the block was weak .. or the clunk I heard when
shifting was a &gt;broken motor mount .. and the banging cracked the block ..
Makes sense. But he doesn't &gt;admit to the broken motor mount.  I don't know
if this makes a difference, but the clunking &gt;seemed to start after
tightening the clutch cable.  A failed attempt, so he replaced it.
