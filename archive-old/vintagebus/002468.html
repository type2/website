Subject: So-called &quot;IRS&quot; rear axle

I beg to differ with many &quot;experts&quot; and with other folks who have been
dealing with, working on, and writing about VW's for a long time, BUT a
SWING AXLE is--and I repeat IS-- an Independant Rear Suspension, ie.
&quot;I.R.S.&quot;

It is a misnomer at the least and downright misleading to VW neophytes to
call the later double jointed independant rear suspension &quot;IRS&quot;, as if
excluding the earlier design from this description.

&quot;IRS&quot; simply means that each rear wheel can react independantly to
irregularities in the road surface (bumps) without affecting the other rear
wheel.  Swing axle suspensions do this quite well, thank you, and without
all of the complexity, maintenance, and expense of 4 (count 'em) constant
velocity joints.

The later post '67 double jointed rear axles were added to improve handling
(the rear tires remain more or less upright as they deflect), NOT ride
quality.  I also  suspect VW wanted to get in on the &quot;CV&quot;
bandwagon...there's great profit margins in selling replacement joints.

Many people mistakenly use the &quot;IRS&quot; label when they are trying to
distinguish Bay Window and later suspensions from Splitty's rears.  Again:
SPLIT WINDOW BUSES  DO  HAVE IRS, INDEPENDANT REAR SUSPENSION.  Now you know
better!

(And by the way, ball joint front axles are well known to be STIFFER than a
well-lubricated, properly adjusted king/link-pin front end)
