I have one 6&quot; grinder/wire wheel that I use specifically for that purpose.
Over the years the grinding wheel has taken on a rounded face from using one
side edge or the other. 20 years ago tubing notchers were not in the price
range of hobbyist, but now that anyone can afford one I don't have much of an
excuse not to buy one, except maybe years of bad habits!

Excellent point Ronnie, thanks for bringing that up. I didn't
honestly expect this many ideas! I will be using 1/2&quot; EMT. it grinds
easy, bends easy, and (as I found out last night) actually welds
pretty darn decent. My first thought was the grinding wheel, but what
I saw at the local big store, didn't look like it would fit the bill
but I might give it a try.
