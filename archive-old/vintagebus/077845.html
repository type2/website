Subject: Re: [VB] flames

surlygirl:
&gt; .....  i offered the thought that the flames
&gt;&gt; were from the incredible speed... the friction between nose and air 
&gt;&gt; made
&gt;&gt; flames.  like re-entry dude.  ;-)

bueses:
&gt; Does that mean that he can't display a 0-60 in 11 minutes sticker on 
&gt; the rat
&gt; DC if he has flames on the front?

Actually it's all good.  See, the flames are from friction between the 
slower bus reality and the more frenetic, familiar reality around it.  
Thus members of the bus culture often refer to &quot;feeling the heat&quot; in 
heavy traffic or getting &quot;burned&quot; by unscrupulous garages.  And of 
course we're all familiar with overheating problems -- they too stem 
from reality friction*.

Curiously, scientists have been unable to explain the apparently 
contradictory heatlessness of the Winter Bus, but theorize a connection 
between that and a generalized seasonal torpor in the primary reality 
sequence that reduces the speed differential -- and thus friction and 
resultant heat - between the adjacent Weltanschauungen.  So perhaps: 
magnetic, seasonal graphics.  Flames in summer, frosted windows in 
winter.  So nicely dualistic, too.

* Seriously!  See Hythlodaeus, Rafael.  &quot;Don't Rub Me The Wrong Way: A 
coefficient of reality-differential friction in two test cases,&quot; 
Quarterly Journal of Suspect Chronemics 27, 1998, pp 47-63.

Happy Holidays, Bussers.
