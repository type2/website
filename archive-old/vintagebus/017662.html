Hi all,

We're still recovering from &quot;the weekend&quot;!  I haven't even unpacked much or
cleaned up any of our Busses yet because I had to fly (work) Tuesday and
Wednesday.  &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #16&quot; was a complete success,
despite the heat that we all suffered through, and then adapted to. 
Attendance was down a bit to about 125 Busses (down from about 150 in 1999)
because of the heat wave the Midwest went through last week.  A few broke
down and still got there somehow (their Breakdown tales were told in
competition for the &quot;Hard Luck&quot; award), some just &quot;whimped out&quot; and others
had good, legitimate reasons for missing all the fun.  Anyway, Mother
Nature is always an uncertainty when planning and running an event of this
size, and I know that I spent a lot of time cooling off under the outside
PVC cold showers that I cobbled up and installed outside of each bathhouse.
 They were very popular!  Last year wasn't nearly as warm, but oh well! 
The die-hard &quot;Bus Nuts&quot; as well as many new Bus enthusiasts and lots of
listees all showed up to play, and play, and play.....then again, you've
been hearing about their adventures in recent posts on the Lists.  Thanks
again to all of our dedicated new and old Bus friends who attended and made
the event so much fun for everyone!

Now...about the current tire thread on the Missouri Micro's list
(Transporter tire size/gearing ratios/bias ply vs. radial ply, etc.) as
well as recent ones on the VintageBus List...  I personally prefer a light
truck or heavy duty sidewall &quot;radial&quot; tire.  We currently have the correct
bias ply tires on our 1966 &quot;Flood Bus&quot; Sundial Camper.  They work fine, but
in cross winds, and on todays highways with worn truck ruts in the lanes,
and the grooved roads that drain off rainwater, those bias plies are much
less forgiving.  On the rutted and grooved highways and roads, you are
constantly on guard for the Bus to be hurled in one direction or another by
those road features, and then making quick corrections.  This makes for
more stressful long distance driving.  Radials are much less affected by
this stuff.

I just went through some lengthy research to buy new tires for my 1967
Westy Campmobile.  I wanted radial ply tires, with at least 2 ply &quot;stiffer&quot;
sidewalls.  Most important, I wanted to duplicate the outer circumference
of the original 1967 tire, a 7.00 - 14&quot; bias ply tire.  (note:  DO NOT
consider trailer tires, even at the suggestion of the supposedly
knowledgeable tire store staff - there's a serious reason those tires are
prominently stamped &quot;FOR TRAILER USE ONLY&quot;).  My 1967 Campmobile has the
original stock transmission/gearing, and in storage I have an extra
original 7.00 -14&quot; tire on it's 14&quot; rim that had no wear because it was
mounted in the spare tire position.  I measured this and found that I
wanted an outer circumference of exactly 82.25&quot;.  After much searching, a
week before BNNTA, I had a set of 215/75 R14&quot; Michelin &quot;X&quot; radials mounted
and balanced at Sam's Club in St. Charles, MO for about $320 total out the
door with road hazard policy and an 80,000 mile Michelin warrantee.  These
tires definitely look bigger/fuller/more substantial in the wheel wells
now.  They appear to be about an inch wider in tread width that the
original bias ply spare tire I have.

I was originally running Dunlop SP-4's in a 185 SR 14&quot; size.  The outer
circumference on these Dunlop's was only 80.2&quot; so my motor was working
overtime a little just to do what the German engineers originally planned. 
The new tire's circumference is almost 83&quot;.  Each time my rear axle turns
I'm traveling about 2.5 inches further.  My axle turns about 767 rpms in a
mile verses about 790 before.  Now my speedo seems to be about dead on
accurate, as well as my drive train gearing and ratio's / rpm's.  The drive
to and from our BNNTA event, about two hours each way from St. Louis, was
so much nicer at a higher, more accurate indicated speed at the same rpm's.

In addition to having the new tires installed, I did the following
maintenance in the month prior to our event.  In no particular order:  I
finally used my Bentley manual to learn to correctly tighten my torsion arm
link pin adjustment, installed a new set of correct shocks all the way
around (thanks Ron at Bus Depot), I checked and re-filled my steering box
(a bit low), thoroughly lubed (until &quot;new&quot; grease came out) all the front
end lube fittings, I replaced both old tie rod assemblies with complete new
assemblies with four new tie rod ends (thanks again Steve White for the
loan of that GREAT tie rod end tool!), I cleaned out and re packing my
front drum hubs, bearings and installing new grease seals (thanks again
Ronnie in AZ), I finally checked (and Oh my GOD!, was it way out of
adjustment - actually toed-out 1/8 inch!) and correctly adjusting my &quot;toe
in&quot; (thanks to the Muir &quot;Idiot book&quot; procedure), I installed a new steering
damper, I finally flushed out the old (I'm embarrassed to say about ten
year old) brake fluid, inspected all the brake cylinders for corrosion and
replaced the two rear ones (fronts are fine), I then adjusted the emergency
brake cables and adjusted each brake set, I lubed the all the pedal
assemblies and cables and I spent hours cleaning up and detailing the front
suspension.  

Doing this maintenance has really made a HUGE difference in the way that
the '67 feels on the road!  When I first started out to do all of this, it
kinda felt like a neglected &quot;chore&quot; that I now had to do, but then as I
became re-aquainted with my Bus and all of her components, the &quot;job&quot;
started turning into &quot;fun&quot;, and I found my self looking forward to
returning home from a flight (work) assignment and getting down to the
garage for a long evening of maintenance.  I kinda &quot;fell in love again&quot;
with a nice old Bus I had been unconsciously neglecting the maintenance on
for quite a while.  Now I'm more attuned to her condition, and she's really
a pleasure to drive again.  She now goes a bit faster at the same rpms, the
front end is as tight as it has ever been, and feels more stable.  I only
regret that I took so long to dive into this stuff!  

Hey, don't procrastinate like I did!  It's so not hard!  Get your Bentley
manual and your &quot;Idiot Book&quot; out (or order yours now), gather up your
tools, invite a VW friend over, order some parts and get to it!  You'll do
a good thing, you'll become more knowledgeable, your Bus will be much
happier, safer and more reliable, and perhaps you'll rediscover your love
affair with your Transporter.

Have fun!  I did!
