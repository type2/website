Subject: I need info/ CroCou Road trip

CroCou = Cross Country 
That's right every one.  I need to pool the resources
of the list to partake in a quicky cross country road
trip.  My Uncles moving and my brother and I are
moving his things from Napa, CA to Groton, Conn. 
Obligatory Bus Content: The trip gets me porshe rims
and brakes for my double cab.  Don't worry porshe is
just VW stuff when it comes to aircooled.  I'm
basiclly just redoing my brakes.  The rims are because
BRM's every one hates and bug rims are too narrow.

Anyways to do this trip  I have to take a truck
fromCali to Conneticut and the same truck or a
rent-a-car all the way.  I'm figuring out my route
right now and the costs.  I was hoping you of the list
could let me know which roads are easier to cross with
a fully loaded truck and an idea of the current gas
prices and hotel prices across the country.  I was
trying to wait till friday but we kinda need
information by the end of today.  Thanks guys.  I'm
not hundred percent on the brakes and rims, but the
need to be done before the winter.  This is a quick
way for me to have them done nice.  Peace Out for now
