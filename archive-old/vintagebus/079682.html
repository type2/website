&gt; &gt;The connecting bar with the cup on the end is

&gt; &gt;Any reason for that?

&gt; Paul Smith said he had it built that way to keep
&gt; from having the trailer 
&gt; hit his truck when he &quot;didn't do so good backing
&gt; up&quot;. 

Been there, although it was more forward than back.
When I drove 3 hours north to pic up my '67 Panel I
had to hire a car trailer.
My brother was with me &amp; we hit the golden arches for
an unhealthy breakfast.
I slid into 2 parking spots end to end with a BMW 5
series on the left hand side of the car trailer and a
locally built GM prestige car on the right of my
pickup I was using to tow.
When we went to get out....you guessed it.
The car trailer was wider than my pickup and I created
a 9 inch paint scrape down the GM's rear side trim.
I left my name &amp; number for the owner &amp; she was
overwhelmed by my honesty.
Strangely, I gave her my insurance number but she
never claimed on it.
Maybe fessing up made her decide not to follow it up.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
