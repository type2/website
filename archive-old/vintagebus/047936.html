&lt;&lt; What has the better chance of getting a seized plug out and saving the
 threads...   Cold engine, warm engine, hot engine??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Probably best to just have it a bit warm after starting and running it about 
5 minutes.  Aluminum of the head and other parts of the engine swell in size 
faster than the steel parts.  So the threaded hole will probably be bigger 
than the spark plug when just warmed up a bit.  
  If that does not work try a hammer and punch to shock the plug into 
releasing the head threads.  Next time you remove your spark plugs use 
graphite (Pencil lead) to lubricate the threads of the plug or at least some 
good quality anti-sieze material.   Eric&amp;Barb
