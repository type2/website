Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

metal particles and allowing them to be sucked up by the oil  pump once
again.
------------------------------
Afraid not ......... The magnet holds them in place, that stagnant area
still has very little action to cause the particles to move.
Now I must admit .................. aren't we all supposing that we're
right?
When an Engineer or Flim Flam man started selling magnets that wrap
around a filter somebody said &quot;That might work&quot;.
I've had lots of air compressors (Worthington, Ingersol, Chicago
Pneumatic) that had large magnets sitting in the bottom of the oil
reservoir. For some reason they thought that they might help.
Open up that transmission on your engine lathe and you'll find one.
I feel the same way ............... they might help.
