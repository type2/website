I removed a set of the plugs by the nut-welding method... Bob Hoover
recommended the use of a(n?) eutectic solder... less heat to distort/etc,
and usable with a propane torch &amp; MAPP gas, I think.
What was harder for me was removing the large thin nut (well-peened 35 years
ago... frozen on) that keeps the lower axle fixed in relation to the lower
inboard bearing.
The nut must be removed in order to tap the axle out so that you can remove
the large snap ring holding the bearing in place...
Pry out the peened areas carefully... and if you are lucky, the nut will
back out counterclockwise with some persuasion from a brass punch. I wasn't
so lucky...
My brass punch deformed again &amp; again... steel had to be used. This mangled
the nut... I'm going to try to order some new nuts &amp; fabricate a socket that
will install/remove it without so much effort...

Good luck...

I'm at the stage where I have to
&gt;&gt; remove the plug on the back of the box.
