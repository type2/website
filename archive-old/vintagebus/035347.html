Subject: Aftermarket quality parts (Do they exist?)
Message-ID: &lt;6cb44b20.2527985a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi everyone,
Obviously the title says it all.
This early sat. am I decided to wash my deluxe because it's so damn dirty.
While washing my WCM elephant mirrors I moved it a little and guess what. The 
whole mirror snapped off from the arm. How's that for quality.
Well, I guess it does go to show that buying German parts might be worth it 
rather than replacing aftermarket parts all the time when they fail to live 
up to the standards of original German parts.
I guess now I'll have to locate those NOS round mirrors for my deluxe.
Hope everyone else is having a better weekend so far. Feels like Monday
