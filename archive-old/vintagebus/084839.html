&gt;I got a wold hair and decided to rebuild my Pict 28 but in the
&gt;dismantling process a little ball bearing fell out of somewhere.

Look at page K-2 2 of the '63-'67 Bentley.  There are two ball check
valves in the carb.  The larger one goes down near the bottom of the
float chamber and should be retained by a flat metal plug.  The smaller
one is in the passage under the accelerator pump squirter (brass
kitchen sink faucet thing), and appears to be retained by a pin driven
into the passage from the side.  Normally these balls don't come out
during a rebuild, so something else has probably come loose to allow one
to fall out.
