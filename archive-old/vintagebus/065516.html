Subject: RE: [VB] bias plys?

I have coker_dot_com Bias Plys on my '55, they drive fine.  They do grab the
cracks as I have heard people say but not much.

Mt '60 Double Cab had new bias plys, it drove awesome.

I just drove a VW with old/bald/worn bias plys from Reno to Phoenix, the
back tires were mud and snow, those grabbed the road A LOT.  The screwed
up front end probably didn't help either.
