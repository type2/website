Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor Questions

Had this happen this summer. Timing was all out of wack, and then on closer
inspection noticed the last thread and a half on the bolt to tighten the
clamp was stripped. Time for another clamp.....

What I didn't suspect was a broken
&gt; dist, clamp,causing the dist to move &amp; throw timing
&gt; completely off. Couldn't see it was broken.
