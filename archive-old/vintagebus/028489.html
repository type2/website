Subject: cooling ...options?

howdy doo all
I went to give the 62 a final inspection before pickup tomorrow... and i
noticed one last thing that i really frowned upon.  they had the motor
rebuilt at a reputable shop in montana a few years ago...and really
haven't driven it any since then.
the motor is a 1600 sp as far as i can tell and has an oil filter setup
on it.  ok, thats fine....good actually.  i wondered where they routed
the lines from....yup...you guessed it.  they used the adaptor that
mounts where the oil cooler mounts...but they eliminated the stock oil
cooler :(  instead... the person who rebuilt the motor decided to put an
oil cooler on the front (FIF) of the fan shroud over the opening of the
fan.  bad.  this does cool the oil...but blows more hot air over the
engine...am i correct??  i do want this motor to last, and i plan on
taking it out to remove this setup and install a doghouse fan shroud and
cooler...or even a type 4 cooler if i get ambitious.  The bus still has
the triangular air filter bracket...which i will need to mount on the
fan shroud....don't know how yet...but i'll figure that out later.  one
of my questions is... why did people do this???? this setup was on a
friend's 62 bus also...  that motor had one helluva rod knock to it on
#3... seems to me it got really hot quite often.
since this motor wasn't driven a LOT...and it still runs like a top..i'm
not toooo worried about it right now...as long as i change it all.  one
thing that clued me in to this motor running hot is that the thermostat
was exploded...like a slinky.  bad.

so...does anyone want to give any input before i go and yoink the motor
in a couple of days??

I can't believe how incredibly broke i am... i even went and cashed in
all of the change that was in my 71!
