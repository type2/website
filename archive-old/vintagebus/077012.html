Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny swap and eye damage...

Definitely! But don't get cheap plastic safety
goggles. They're such a pain, you'll end up not
wearing them at all. When I first started doing a lot
of work under the bus, I found that regular safety
goggles fogged up real bad (even the ventalated kind)
and when the plastic lenses got abraised, my vision
was quite obscured. You almost can't work with those.
So I went on ebay and found this pair of antique
safety goggles for about 20 bucks. The ad said from
the 1890's, but they're clearly no older than 1940's
or so. Glass lenses, Metal mesh side protectors, very
comfortable and cool. I put them on and forget about
them. No more crud in my eyes.
