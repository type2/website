&gt; That being the case how do we know that VW (or the original copyright
&gt; holder) hadn't let the copyright lapse on the old manuals?

That is a question for VW.  If they did not renew, than it fell into public
domain in 1982.  If they did renew, then not until 2010 will it be in the
public domain.  Here is the text of a FAQ I found.


&quot;For works published in the years 1904 through 1963, the copyright lasted
for 28 years from date of publication; if the copyright was not renewed,
it lapsed, and the work went into the public domain.  Another 28 years of
protection could be obtained by filing a renewal, for a total term of 56
years (1906 comes from the fact that the U.S. effectively switched to a
47-year second term in 1962, and 1962 minus 56 (the old maximum duration
of two 28-year terms) equals 1906).  If the copyright was not renewed
after its initial 28-year term, the work lapsed into public domain.&quot;
