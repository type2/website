&lt;&lt; I got back from my daughter's Easter Sunday early dinner this afternoon, 
and 
 found my north section of fence around my little front yard was smashed to 
 bits.  The east corner of this little yard is about three feet from my '61 
 Flipseat Westy!
 
 The neighbor came over to tell me that his sister was driving out of their 
 parent's drive across the road, and another driver came barreling around the 
 corner (I live in the heart of downtown Albuquerque) hit her car, and pushed 
 her into a street sign, and my fence.  I've got to thank this woman for 
 having the presence of mind to steer for the fence and not the bus!  
 Seriously, about three feet separate the two.
 
 The only worse thing I heard today was Lou (from Havasu) had a minor engine 
 fire, but got it under control.  Don't think Easter's my favorite 
 holiday....but then most who know me know I'm not a holiday kind of guy.  I 
 work seven days a week:  not many hours each day, but seven days.

 PS I guess the moral is: Carry a fire extinguisher, and all the insurance 
you 
 can afford. &gt;&gt;

Or another moral is: always drive your bus so you know it is safe with you at 
all times.
