I always tell my daughter to keep the &quot;bug&quot; out from under my feet. I don't
think the name stuck with my grandson though!

&gt; i completely agree.  my niece has the dumbest name.  so scott, when you
&gt;get in the family way, are you going to let us/the list name your
offspring?

Well, if _I_ get in the family way, then I'm calling Guinness first! 
But...if I ever have a S.O. with whom I decide to have a child, then yes...I

would certainly consider letting my friends (including those on the list) 
have first dibs at naming. Hey, gotta practice what you preach, right? 

I can imagine the choices now...
