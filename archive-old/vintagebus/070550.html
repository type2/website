Subject: RE: [VB] looking for 48's or 44's for my type 4 motor

Just curious why IDF's vs IDA's? I thought that IDA's where always
better for a street motor, better for idle to middle range rpms. That
IDF's had a bit of advantage when pushing into the high RPMS but
suffered untill then. 
Thanks
Shawn

I would go with 48IDF's way before I went with IDA's on a T-4 bus motor.
Some Dells in good condition would be my first choice too though.
