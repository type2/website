Hey Kelly,

If this were a perfect world I would have you doing a TV show for PBS kind
of like Norm Abram's &quot;New Yankee Workshop&quot;. Or that lame-o Steve Thomas'
&quot;This Old House.&quot; It would be really cool to look in on Saturday afternoon
and watch as you fabricate and install replacement parts for an old bus
cargo floor, or that job you recently did replacing the entire nose. Each TV
season you could do an entire bus project start to finish. I'm sure we'd
have bus owners lined up around the block to have their projects chosen. And
like &quot;This Old House&quot; the aftermarket suppliers could chip in with parts and
advice to get their names in front of the show's viewers.
I don't suppose there's enough of an audience to make this interesting to a
PBS producer but I'd watch faithfully.
John Flowers
