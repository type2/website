&gt; John,
&gt;     Your bus doesn't like being rained on.  There is nothing wrong with 
&gt; it.  It will run fine once things dry out.  Changing the spark plug 
&gt; wires might help a lot if you experience more rain and you need to drive 
&gt; the bus.
&gt;   

yes, but in the same several day rainstorm I was driving a bus that started 
up every time.   Also a bug ditto.   Something got wet, that should not have.   
Also, possibly corrosion made a bad connection.  It rained over 5 inches over 
a few days where I was.
