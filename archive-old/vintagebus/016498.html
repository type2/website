Scott - try swapping the air jets.  It was explained to me by the local 
Weber guru that you want 'lots of gas and not as much air' in the primary.  
It worked for mine.  The idle jet is the next step up from mine, I'm running 
a 55.  This is in a mild 1776, so if you're pushing a 1600 you might be a 
tad rich.

Subject: [VB] Update: bad gas mileage

just a huge thanks to all who have replied. I haven't figured this out yet
but I'm getting some help from someone online with the jetting of the carb
itself.

As far as fuel pressure goes I did replace the plastic base under the fuel
pump a while back and distinctly remember it being like 1/8th in. thinner
than the old base but taking into consideration that the cam would still
travel the same distance I dismissed my concern. Did I go wrong? The bus
does run and idle fine. It is not flooding which would seem to be the result
if the pressure was too high. Am I missing something simple? Please tell me
if I am.

Thanks again for all the help I'll keep you posted,

If anyone is interested here are the current jets,

Pri. Air = 165
Sec. Air =160

Pri. Main = 137
Sec. Main = 140

Pri. Idle = 60
Sec. Idle = 50

yes these are the way they are and were in my carb. It's a weber 32/36
progressive. Any ideas or brainstorms?

Scott
