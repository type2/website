Just wanted to send out an update and some comments on the other messages
along this thread.

First, let me say that when reading Bentley, don't assume that just because
you've read a procedure that has a detail picture of your assembly at the
end that you have read all there is.  After I claimed that I had read
Bentley, I slept on it and realized that I had found no lip on the outer
race of the lower, outer roller bearing.  Checking Bentley again, I found
that there is a separate procedure for boxes put on buses after August 1963.
Since I only put mine on two and a half years ago this had to apply to my
bus :-)

Tonight I successfully removed the redux box from Sunshine and am ready to
start the next stage.  On busses with the roller bearing, you only need to
tap (very FIRM taps) the cover off the box, you don't need any special
pullers as I purported earlier.  The only thing holding my cover on are
guide pins that were very rusty.  Once the cover, then the circlip at the
end of the axle were removed, I used a pair of screwdrivers to edge the
outer, upper bearing out until I could get my puller under the lip.  All
rather easy, once I finally got to it.

I have also learned more about bolts than I ever will use, but in brief, the
bolt used to bolt the box to the spring plate are hardened metric bolts
rated with a classification of 10.9 which is roughly equal to an SAE grade
8.  I believe the 10K bolts mentioned in Bentley are referring to an old DIN
classification which has over time changed to the current 10.9 which is
probably a blur of DIN and ISO standards.

Thanks to everybody that has replied to me publicly and privately with
information and various leads.  I also asked around at work (a large
military-industrial complex) and was referred to a couple local suppliers,
Olander and Mr. Metric for the bolt.  Olander is a supplier to the aerospace
industry and so has a lot of hardened bolts, but I haven't found out if they
have the 12mmX1.5 in the length I need.  The Mr. Metric catalog has a
listing of the part I need, but I haven't called them yet.  If I have to
visit in person, I can hit both of them on the way home Friday.

As for fixing the munged up threads, I'll either replace the whole box, or
use the TimeSert inserts mentioned by Fred &amp; Thom, the jury's still out on
that one, mainly driven by how easy ($$) it will be to get a replacement
box.

Since both my boxes were rebuilt a little over two years ago by Volks Cafe
when I bought my tranny through them and had them swap out the axle
assemblies, I am hoping all my bearings are still in good shape, but I have
a question about how much wiggle I should get out of the stub axle when it
is hanging out with the outer cover off.  Anybody got some input for this?

Finally, I have decided to at least pull the engine to finish this work, as
I am tired of moving around in the confined space under the bus plus I need
to check the head bolts on my AVP rebuild.  I only wish I had pulled the
engine (and maybe the trans) before I started all this.

Thanks for listening,
terry &amp; Sunshine (now short an axle)
