I said:
&gt;Basically take it all apart and then put it back together!

Greg says:
&gt;From experience, I can tell you it's not that easy. Especially the first time.
&gt;I ruined many a speedo while I was learning the resto process. 

Ok, ok,  agreed   :-) I was lucky the first time but thats probably because 
I have worked on small things for most of my life.  The hardest part is
to carefully open up the crome ring with out doing too much damage but
who really cares unless you plan to sell your restored beauty for  32000 bucks
(then you should have Greg restore it for you).
I am restauring my Bus to look good and and then be driven.
Im trying to return as much to stock as possible to pay tribute to VW after 
having run 3 &quot;modified&quot; busses and  several bugs into the ground. 
To find out if my speedo was opened you would have to take it out of my bus
and hold it into the sun!

Before you take the innards apart ask yourself if you are good with small
things
or if you are better at loosening lug nuts and pulling engines. If you mess
up (which I doubt)
still there is a lot of speedo donors out there, so dont be afraid and open
it up and
then look before you act!
Also on these old buses the milage on the speedo is not really an indicator 
of condition anymore, so lets roll 'em back, Volks!

BTW anyone heard of a VW K70 from the early 70s? It was my first &quot;victim&quot; and
it did not survive the demolition derby :-) seems to be impossible to find
these days...
