Subject: Re: [VB] good deal!!! 

[...]

I agree with Clara... this bus is all there, the rust is less than what I
had in '75 when I replaced both lower sides myself, and the rest of what
shows in the photos is very good. That left lower rocker job is trivial
for a good bus body person. I did it myself and had never welded before.
Someone's gonna get a great deal here, they'll do some work, and it'll
be fine. Underside details are all doable too - I know, I dealt with all
that in 94 during the resto of my own bus, which looks identical to this
one, excepting the rust!  A relatively 'easy' project bus that already
looks really good, regardless. Look at that front emblem! and the front
bumper!

Someone save this bus and restore it!
