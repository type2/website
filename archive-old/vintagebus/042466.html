Subject: 61 stuff yet again...(shifter, por15)

hi all,

More on my 61...

Last night i por-15'd the cab area floor.  I did a little bit in the cargo
area too as i had poured too much in my cup, but didnt have enough back
there properly prepped so i gave up and let the rest sit.  In the front i
didnt POR near the acceleartor pedal as i have 2 huge holes hacked in the
floor (from a PO) and think i will be welding there soon.  Probably once i
get it mobile i'll go over to my dads and use his mig.  I have a scirocco
fender that is dented, i'll use it for the patch panels so as to keep the
bus properly german metal, heheh.

Put the shifter back together.  I compared my new shifter bushings from
wolfsburg west to the original one i had, and they are different.  When
installed they leave a gap of aobut 1/8 to 1/16 instead of encircling the
shaft completely... Not perfect but serviceable. Lots of grease applied...

The best thing was they had those bellows that seal the ends of the
shifter tube to keep guck from getting in there... those are a good thing
and im glad i have em.

Put in a new shift coupler front and rear (i was so happy to see that
front shift coupler on my doorstep, i had been waiting a month and was
beginning to be afraid it wouldnt show)  I antisiezed the holy crap out of
the front one.  After having to drill grind cut the old one off i never
want to have to do that again...

so, tonight i am going bowling with my bus club and tomorrow i will lube
the tranny, lube clutch and accel cable, reassemble accelerator and
(hopefully) get the bus back on its own four feet :) (if you live in saint
louis MO and want to join us in rollin them balls, p-mail me)

I took a few pictures... this camera should be full by the end of next
month, so i will have more pictures on my website just as soon as i get a
photo CD made.

take care,

Steve
