Subject: large round rear view mirror...

I'm not the best at describing things... but I ran into what was described
as a &quot;rear view mirror for early type II&quot; that was round, 3 or 4 inches in
diameter.

A round rear-view mirror?  Any idea what this is, if it is accurately
described (even for a type II?).  Any idea on value?

P.S.  My '63 Crew should have &quot;elephant ear side mirrors&quot;, right?
