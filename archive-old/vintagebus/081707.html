Subject: Re: [VB] Broken Cam on Beetlemex Engine....

  Ronnie told me that this was an early problem 
&gt;with the solid lifter Beetlemex engine but that he had never heard of it 
&gt;happening to one with hydraulic valves.

  Not the Beetlemex engines, the Genuine VW factory replacement engines had a cam problem a few years back. 
These are different then the Beetlemex as they are designed and built as a replacement engine. Beetlemex engines 
are engines built for BEETLES only. There are a few different new engines available from different VW suppliers in 
Mexico, though I believe the factory where Beetlemex engines came from has shut down along with the beetle plant..
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else have this problem with the hydraulic lifter engine?  Ronnie 
&gt;thought that this engine may use a unique cam because of its filter oil 
&gt;pump.  

   They use a DISHED cam with a hydraulic lifter grind in the Beetlemex hydraulic engines. Most of the aftermarket 
hydraulic cams use a flat cam.
You could probaly call DPR in Santa Ana, Cali and have them custom grind you a hydraulic dished cam out of a good 
dished (German) core or Use a flat hydraulic cam and change the oil pump to a flat cam one, but I do not think that a 
flat cam filter pump will clear the stock exhuast.
