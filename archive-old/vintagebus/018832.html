What's the difference between 'early' and 'late'?

I've never seen a set of barn or 'early' belly pans intact
on a bus.

I have a friend who found some NOS pans which
only have one diagonal stamping .....are they the
early pans?

thanks

&gt; 
&gt; Make sure you get the correct bellypans.
&gt; There are 51?-58 and 59-67 ones!
&gt; Only repops I've seen are the late style.
