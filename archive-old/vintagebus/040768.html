As far as &quot;honest mechanic in Seattle&quot; goes, my recommendation goes to
Louis Foreign Auto at 77th and Roosevelt. I take my Vanagon there and it's a
pleasure dealing with them.

Since it's still Friday - our daughter and her friend are planning to move
to
Seattle in June after they graduate from the University of Vermont.  They
are
planning to drive their cars (one '00 Jetta and one '93 Fox) across the
country - stopping at relatives and friends along the way.

Dick and I haven't said anything to Kate, but we aren't too sure of that Fox
going from one side of the country to the other.  We wondered if we could
ship it out (loaded with their belongings) so that they could at least
travel
together.

Anyone know what it costs to ship from this side to the other side?  Anyone
know an honest mechanic in Seattle for when the Fox has trouble?  How about
jobs!  I think the only thing they are sure of is they are going to Seattle
(because it's not here) and they're driving!

By the way - we were visiting our son at Ft. Lewis in Tacoma, WA a couple of
weeks ago.  We weren't able to go to the show as we were flying out that day
but we were treated to seeing many nice Vow's on their way to the show!  Oh,
how we envy all of you on the West coast!  Every day we were out three we
saw
more vintage vw's than we see in a whole summer around here!  It's so neat
that you drive them!
