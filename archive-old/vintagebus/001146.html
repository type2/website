Has anyone ever considered putting a VR6 into a splittie?  I picked up a 98
Jetta GLX with a trashed rear, but the car is perfect from the B pillar
forward.  Seems a barn collapsed on it and I'm friends with the PO - so I
bought it up for a song.  Also have sights on a 64 Panel Van that is in
pretty bad shape.  The rear would need to be completely cut out and replaced
&gt;from about the middle of the bus back.  It appears to be a good match, as
I'm not relying on the resoration to go paricularly quick, and I have use of
another much sturdier (and newer) barn on the same friends' property.
