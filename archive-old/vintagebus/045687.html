Subject: Bubble top sundial  camper ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Some new rainbow (hippie) friends of mine stopped by with their *new*  60's 
Sundial (sp?) camper to get some parts for thier broken turn signal.  It had 
a big bubble top with two windows at the sides in the bubble.  Lots of 
headroom.  They said it was stock. It was in  good, no rust condition with 
the exception of a banged up nose and engine lid.  Even had the spice rack.  
Original black ca plates.  I have not seen one of these.  Does anyone know 
about this bubble top version and if there are pics online somewhere of 
others such as this one?  They live in Sacramento so I imagine they bought it 
in sac.  Probably some local norcal list members have seen this beast .  
Trying to gather some info for them.  TIA
