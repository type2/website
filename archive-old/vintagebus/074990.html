Subject: RE: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

  I have an NOS BN4 heater instalation kit. It has a type 3 part number 311
963 107 C on the timer switch and no number on the rest of the install kit.
The switch has a timer on it, which I don't know whatfor and there is a
relay 113 963 141B which also must have something to do with it. 
  So you might need to check the fuses, relay and timer switch first.

Subject: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question


Hey you gas heater gurus out there......I have a question for you:

I have a BN-4 that recently quit working....I am dl'ing the manual from 
vintagebus_dot_com right now =)

Flick the switch on and I get nothing....no clicking from the fuel pump or 
heater firing up..no fan either..

I am correct to assume, that due to all of the safety circuits/switches on 
the heater, if no fuel reaches the glow plug...nothing else will be
triggered on?

Basically...if the fuel pump has taken a dive, and no fuel reaches the 
heater, then nothing else would/should happen...correct?

From looking at the wiring diagrams, the pump should be energized 
(clicking)as soon as the switch is clicked to the on position..right?

Can the pump be pulled and bench tested with 12V on 1 terminal and ground on

the other:? 

This is my first exposure to a gas heater, so pardon my dumbassedness =)
