&gt;
&gt; Good Money?? Doesn't that convert to about $200 or $250 a day??
&gt;
&gt; If I were putting my vehicle in a commercial, my contract with them
&gt; would have to stipulate that I be there. And my day rate is at least
&gt; that much. Personally, I don't think anyone should provide a vehicle
&gt; unless the day rate is at least $400. These people (ad men) can and
&gt; should pay adequately.

I know what you are saying, but I'm, a bit of a slag and figure that I'd
rather have
the £100 than someone else, and besides my bus isn't a show winner
so I'm not too worried about it.  As you say they need me more than I need
them
so I figure thet they're not going to upset me too much.  The guy in question

is not an ad company so it's not a one-off call.  I've supplied my bus a few
times
and I'm happy with my reward - I've not got the only split bus in the uk so
they'd
find someone else if I said no and I'm keen to keep in with the guy because
it leads
to other jobs and contacts.  I am however, a little shy when it comes hiring
out
the pickup because it's shiney  : )
