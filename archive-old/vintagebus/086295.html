Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel 
  pump in  1600DP

30 years is pretty good! I replace my cloth fuel lines every year and always check that grommet as well- better safe than sorry.

  The grommet on my 70 gave up after about 30 years and I went with the split 
fuel line cover with clamps. What bothered me was the rubber grommet looked 
OK but the fuel line had worn it away inside and the fuel line was in the 
process of being sawed through by the edge of the hole in the tin. This 
wasn't at all apparent but luckily I caught it.

I had no idea VW only built cars to last a &quot;few years at the most&quot;. Since my 
new grommet is of newer materials maybe that's why it's lasted 5 years and 
still is plyable?
No offense but i'll stick with it, plus it looks much better.
