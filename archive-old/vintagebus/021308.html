 More of what he's really looking for is to have more hill pulling ability. &gt;&gt;

Hi Travis,
Installing a bug tranny will just increase the RPMs for the same MPH in 
fourth.
There is only two ways you are going to be able to achieve both of these 
goals.  Install at least a 4.125 or the higher geared 3.875 R&amp;P freeway 
flier, either one with the .82 KG and bus fourth gear.  Then install a 1641, 
1776 type 1&amp;2 engine or 1800 or 2 liter type 4 engine modified to fit the 
early type 2 engine compartment (Tranny must be beefed up for these last 
two!).  Though we are nervous about the 1776cc type 1 engine due to boring of 
the case for the cylinders which thins way down the thickness of the standard 
engine case forward of #3 cylinder.  Plus most machine shops do not radius 
the bottom corners of this bore to help prevent cracking!  Resulting in oil 
pouring out the front of the case.
   If you still do not have enough hill climbing power carry extremely small 
outer diameter tires for the rear to install at the begining of any big 
hills!    Eric&amp;Barb
