I paid $150 for NOS Hella lights (one pair, w/o bulbs) on Ebay, plus $31
shipping from Germany, a couple of months ago.  It was a dutch auction, and
five sets were sold, including at least one other pair to a VB list member.
Another pair of NOS Hella reached $152.50 w/o reaching reserve on Ebay
yesterday:
