Heard some interesting stories at the Marin show today. =20
 =20
Seems the Mark (the guy in the pictures cutting up the RHD BD Panel) is g=
oing the John Jones route and building a DD 15 window with BD front clip,=
 and if that's not good enough. Thom's ex 54 RHD Deluxe will soon be seen=
 sporting air suspension and hammered in the dirt. The best quote I heard=
 regarding this was &quot;This will be the last Kelly Park for him. Someone's =
going to kick his _at_$$ for that&quot; I say do what you want it's your money / =
VW, just not the road most would take with the same Bus.

Also the &quot;56&quot; Single Cab pictured on Sam and/or Nicks web page is actuall=
y Thom's old '55 that a buddy of mine bought last Tuesday. Drives it ever=
yday and loves it!! Good deal for him and now Thom has more room at his p=
lace to play with his Porsches. Good for him too!
