&gt; i haven't taken the rear pulley off for a while-but i imagine i need a 
&gt; pulley-puller type mechanism. now for taking the old oil pump thing out do 
&gt; i need any special tools, or will it just come out when i take the four 
&gt; bolts off.

Hi Kevin,
Both jobs can be done with a pair of slot tip screwdrivers, but there is a 
good chance of slipping and scratching the engine case which will cause 
future oil leaks!  Having both removal tools is alot easier, less time and 
less dangerous.

&gt; then for installation-it basically came with no instructions, just to keep 
&gt; the filter to the drivers side.
&gt; 
&gt; it came with two gaskets-i assume one is for between the pump and the case, 
&gt; and one between the pump and the extension arm that goes to the filter. do 
&gt; you use any type of sealant on these gaskets? or anywhere in this 
&gt; operation?

NO!

&gt; then for the filter attachment-as i have only owned vws my bus and a newly 
&gt; acquired squareback. how does the filter attach-is this a dumb question. do 
&gt; i just buy one-and it is obvious? are all filters a standard 
&gt; attachment-just look for the best quality-or is the way the filter attaches 
&gt; different deoending on the filter?

Filters have differant thread mounts from auto to auto.  You will have to 
measure the approximate length of filter you can use in the space given.  
Then take the pump cover to a FLAPS and check thread fit.  Then make sure to 
use ONLY filters with internal relief valve (Spring visable just inside 
outlet opening.).  We only use WIX filters since having swelled several and 
even blew up one Fram filter during weather 50F and less.  Plus WIX filters 
seem to be much better quality filter wise.
