It's metallic light blue with dark blue stripes, a Kombi or Std. with no bumpers. The guy will take less than the $1,700 it's listed for at www.fresnobee_dot_com. He used it to haul band equip., I remember seeing a lot of black carpet lining the interior. The PO had it cherried out, but the CO hasn't kept cosmetics up. Said it drives great, straight. That's all I know, here's his number,  559-229-8111
