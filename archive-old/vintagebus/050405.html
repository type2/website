Subject: [VB] Nose Clip Wanted &amp; SAFARI HELP!
Message-ID: &lt;0.1156e653.259d2971_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Looking for any leads to an ORIGINAL front nose skin.  Also, I finally got 
around to calling Creative Engineering in England.  They will be resuming 
production on the safari windows next week.  I was very pleasantly suprised 
by the courteous employees there and can't wait until i get my safaris.  The 
only problem i had was that over the phone they kept calling me a yankee! :) 
I'm just really hoping the quality of their product is as good as their 
customer service and what everyone says it to be.  But anyway, on a 67 bus 
with safaris what kind of antanna was used and where was it placed?  If I am 
going out on a limb financially for the safaris themselves i just have to 
make sure that I have everything right!
