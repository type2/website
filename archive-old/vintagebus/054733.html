&gt; I am CLOSE to getting this engine in and my bus running in the next couple

&gt; in PA, and can't find it anywhere. Please advise to mail order source, or
&gt; someother way to get it...I have called farm tractor stores, all the auto
&gt; parts houses (most haven't a clue), and am often told to use the gl5. I want

Sta-lube makes the stuff.  Usually available at most FLAPS.  You can also
use Redline MT-90, which is synthetic, safe for your transmission, and
kind of expensive.  Since I don't change tranny lube all that often, the
extra expense isn't important to me.
