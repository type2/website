Don't get too concerned Andre. I have thick skin and a short memory. Still,
the economics of buying new vehicles escapes me. I could not possibly spend
in a year what one new car payment comes to on all of my cars combined just
for maintenance and repair. Break it down to one daily driver bus and the
logic is even more off. Figure a new engine, tranny, and tires every year
for less than the cost of driving a prestigious Ford Taurus? Absolutely
ridiculous, what a snow job. And just because a cynical corporation that
once made my buses is selling a new improved widget that borrows the name
from a good vehicle they once produced will not sway my opinion either. Let
me see them offer restoration parts like GM does, or sell the retired
tooling to people that will, and then we'll talk. Till then, they are
nothing more than another corporate vagrant looking for a handout. People
saying they drive a new car because of weather damage is another red
herring. Sure, it may seem real to them, but it doesn't wash. So you bought
a $20,000 car and will drive it for say, five years in order to save the bus
you paid $1500 for from the road salt. I would be willing to bet that for
somewhat less than $20,000 every five years you could get the Metwiz to redo
all of the damage on a continuing basis. Sort of a subscription. You pay him
three or four hundred a month and when the bus is all eaten up he will give
you a loaner car and weld it all back together. Yep, have a nice one and see
you in about five years. Keep them checks coming.
