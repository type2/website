Subject: Re: disc brakes fitted to a 67?
Message-ID: &lt;5205c1d5.24acf8f0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Jeff,
Please review the archives on the topic. There has been lots of info. I wrote 
some of it. To add front disc brakes, you have most of the stuff you need 
now. That is if you have a 67 dual master cylinder which was stock in 67. You 
need to get disc brake spindles onto your front suspension. The 71-79 buses 
had disc brakes; the 71-72 are smaller discs and calipers than the 73-79.  
The larger 73-79 units are cheaper and better. Neither of these will fit on 
&quot;king pin&quot; front beams without some work. Two approaches: 1) Find a front 
beam (ball joint) from a 68-69 bus which will accept the the disc brake 
spindles AND is a bolt in modification of 65-67 buses. Then get used spindles 
and carriers and backing plates (optional) and new discs, calipers, pads 
bearings, seals and wheels (small 5 not large 5). You also may need different 
brake hoses to the calipers. You don't need the power brake vacuum assist 
&gt;from the disc brake busses. It adds lots of complexity and the pedal effort 
is not enough to need it. I have done this and am happy. You also will need 
to add the pressure reducer from the 71-79 bus to lower the line pressure to 
the rear drums. In addition you need a 2 lb check valve in the line to the 
front discs to keep the pads near the rotors. These are available at larger 
FLAPS and particularly places that specialize in parts for race cars. Down 
side. The 69-69 beam rides about 1.5 inches higher in the front. OR OPTION 2. 
Bus Boys sells adaptor swing arms that fits right onto your beam and accept 
the ball joints and disc brake spindles. Cost is not small, but considering 
the amount of work saved by not changing out the beam, it probably ballances 
out.

Good luck and keep us posted.
