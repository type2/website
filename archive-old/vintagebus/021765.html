&lt;&lt;  Go to a bearing supply house or a &quot;real&quot; Vw parts house
with the old bearings or the numbers off the old bearings.  They
are very standard items.  Expect to pay $25-30 each. &gt;&gt;

Coming in late on this thread as 'the' season is upon me and
I'm really behind the 8-ball on a lot of projects!

I believe that we are talking about a '64-'67 style redux set up
here?  If so, I did some legwork on this topic a few months back
and determined that I could beat just about any bearing house
prices and was at least competitive with some VW FLAPS.  The
later redux boxes take the follow 'standardized' bearing numbers.
You can use these numbers anywhere in the world and get what
you need.  They take 2 of #6306, 1 of #6305, and 1 of #N207E.
The 6000 series bearings are ball bearings while the N-bearing
is a roller.  If you do go to a bearing supply house they might
ask you for the 'fit' of the bearing.  This is how tight the inner race
will be on the shaft.  Tell them you are looking for a &quot;C3&quot; fit.  This
is a very regular, common, run-of-the-mill fit and they will have it
on the shelf.

Without looking at my notes (look ma!  no hands!) the earlier redux
housing require 2- #6306s and 2- #6305s.  No roller here.

I am not currently in the parts supply business at this time.
However,  should you folks need bearings and whatnot that is
rear suspension/transaxle related and cannot source it through
your regular channels, then post me a note and I'll see what I
can turn up.

Whichever direction you take on this I would insist on FAG or
at least SKF bearings.  In theory, all bearings meet an international
standard for production quality but it sure seems to me that the
FAGs hold up much better than the other brands.  The SKFs
come in a close second for durability.  Again, just my &quot;O&quot;.

As a side note-Having been in the VW world for quite some time
now I have noted that this a a very seasonal 'hobby'.  If you need
a part or something for your car then the late Fall to early Spring
time frame is the best time in both parts availability and promptness
in shipping.  (Some of my customers who have been waiting patiently
for me to ship might be skeptical of that last statement!  ;)  If you
wait until Summer time to order product then you'll get in line with
everyone else and may have a long wait ahead of you.  Most of
us who make a living selling VW related components are fairly
small and have limited production capabilities for a fairly small
and limited market.  If you are thinking about getting some goodies
for your V-Dub then, IMO, now is the time to do it.  Get ahead of
the wave or be prepared to wait until the next one!

Back to the transaxles!
