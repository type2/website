Subject: Re: [VB] Front sway bar

Hi Duck,
Getting tires with stiffer sidewalls, stiffer shocks, and the anti-sway bar 
all add up to a better handling bus in cross winds and when the semis are 
passing you by.  We did the stiffer tires and anti-sway bar at the same time 
so we can not say which improved the ride more.  Have not tried aftermarket 
anti-sway bars, so have no info on them.  We would suggest getting the entire 
front end for at least spare parts and in case your front end is the early 65 
(Before chassi # 215 036 651 OCT64) which only has needle bearings on the 
outer end of the swing arms and the earlier bushings that waer out so badly 
on the inner sides.  Of course assuming your front end still is the original! 
 Does anyone know where to look on the front end for the suspension ID number 
there?
