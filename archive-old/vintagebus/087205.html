  a couple of these

Hiya Karl,
 
Of course the problem with that post is just what I mentioned in my original post.  Is what the writer describes as a Z-Bed actually a Z-Bed or simply the folding mechanism for a camper?  It makes me suspicious that a Westy is &quot;nearby&quot;.  Certainly though, this is a lead I'd check out if I were in S.C.
 
ps.  Did you get yourself settled in Coos Bay?
 
Mike
