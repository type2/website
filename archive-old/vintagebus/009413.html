With all the talk of engine decisions, what would stop someone from putting
a great type IV engine/tranmsission into an early bus?  Too much engine bay
surgery? simply fit?

&gt;The consensus of folks I've talked to that have achieved this is that while in the end they were pleased with the results, they wouldn't do it again nor recommend it.  It's not an easy conversion and the benefits are outweighed by the ordeal of getting everything to work together.  The mods are hard to reverse as well, so if you're concerned about the potential investment value of your bus, think about that.  At least it would be easier to pull the motor when your valves drop all over the place than it would be in a late model! ;-}

I understand that the Victor Frankenstein of the type 2 world, Ed O'Donnel is gonna try this on a rotten 61 Westy that he has.  It'll have an upright type 4 with either a beetle IRS or a Porsche 5 speed (with a beetle tranny under the z-bed for a spare).  I'll reserve any final personal judgements till I see this beast!
