Harry,

If your original loom is still in place, just cut it in half somewhere
between the two main cross braces, tape your ends of your new loom to the
cut ends, and pull the ends thru. Tape them or otherwise fasten them very
well, and use the old loom to pull the new one thru. Make certain that you
have the new loom facing the correct way (front end going towards the
front) as you can only do this once!
