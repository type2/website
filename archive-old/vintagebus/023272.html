I saw a full length &quot;industrial&quot; rack at the last bug-o-rama for something
like $400; Clara can correct me if I'm wrong on the price.

&gt;Ok folks I have another value question.  I'm going up north to look at a VW
&gt;Bus Saturday that the owners says has a full length Luggage Rack on it.
&gt;He said it's not a Camper Bus but described a wooden floor, a closet, a fold
&gt;down table and a frig/sink unit.  Sure sounds like a Westy.  But he said the
&gt;top is solid.  OK my question; what does a full lenght rack bring?  I
&gt;thought if it would be worth trading for a 1/3 one and a set of Safari's. To
&gt;much to expect?
