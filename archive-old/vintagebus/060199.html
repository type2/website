Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for tips for Metal replacments and sandblasting

Reread the post. He asked how straighten the bed in a DC that was warped
from the DPO throwing heavy things in it. These aren't little dents, they
are large areas of stretched metal running between the bed supports. Can't
use a dolly here, unless you have one about 3 feet x 2 feet with a body
hammer about the same size.

I'm doing this right now on my DC. Flailing away with a big ball peen hammer
is working quite well for me. The bed pretty close to being straight. I only
have to apply a little (GASP!) filler to make it look brand new.

I'm sure you have a better way to do this so, why don't you share it with
us?

First, please no flailing with hammers!!  Although some body shops use this
method (I worked at &gt; Macco for a total of 2 hours before I walked out the
door-theres things I won't do even to an American car!), it's not advisable
unless you like buying body filler by the case. This is no way to straighten
metal.  Always back your metal with a dollie to keep it from being pushed to
far passed straight and becoming either a dent or a high spot.
