Well and that's how actually Official Workshop Manual has them listed:
Kombi
Micro Bus
Micro Bus DeLuxe
Pick-Up
Delivery Van
Ambulance
so I say that this would be the best reference of all. There were
differences between these but I bet all of you know about these so I won't
even mention them. To new guys I'd say go out and explore. Read books,
bus-books. Don't be shy to ask questions. Don't feel silly. We all were
there before. It would be first of all very helpful in understanding the
concept of the &quot;Vintage Bus&quot; and second will help with understanding the
needs of a Bus, needs for maintenance, upkeep and most of all - love. You
got to love it 'cause if you don't, well, I can only say that you are
driving a wrong type of vehicle.

Later,
