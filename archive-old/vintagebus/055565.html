&gt; &gt;According to one of Kabayos old posts the 205/75/15 is one of the most
&gt; &gt;accurate sizes. Anyway I do not want to start a huge good tire bad tire
&gt; &gt;thing...All I want to know is has anyone put a set of 205/75/15's on a
&gt; &gt;stock height early bus.
&gt; 

Peerless tires has a 205-75-15 Ambassador style radial $25.00 each. I have 
them on my 62 panel with 5K miles on them. Barry and JP from the bus co-op in 
Albuq. also use this brand and size and have been real happy with the 
Ambassador. Peerless also has one called the President that sells for around 
$32.00 each.
