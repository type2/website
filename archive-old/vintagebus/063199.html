Subject: Rust on spindle

While working on the front brakes of the '65 single cab I found some rust on
the spindles where water had gotten behind the backing plate.  Any
recommendations on how to take care of this?  My plan is to treat the area
with muriatic acid or something similar and followed by a coat of high zinc
primer and then what kind of paint?  Enamel, Epoxy???  Any suggestions
gladly accepted but it has to be rattle can stuff as I don't have any
painting equipment.  BTW, on the high zinc primer I seem to remember a
suggestion that Napa carried some.  Is it their brand or something else like
Krylon or VHT?

Regards,

Thomas
