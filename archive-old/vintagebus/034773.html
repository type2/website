Hi Ed,
Well the trouble is that the radio was not stock in the VW.  Stock means that
it came installed in the VW from the factory.  There were stock accessories
including radios from the dealership or more often aftermarket accessories,
some that could be ordered/ bought through your individual dealer or more
often at other local shops.  So if you only want to stick with Saffire they
came in both AM, and AM/FM.  Also they came in Playtape or 8 track a little
later.  There were also Blaupunkts, Akkords, Beckers and many other radios for
that and other years with many other features.  Eric &amp; Barb
