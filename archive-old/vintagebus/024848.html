&gt; Hello to the list,
&gt; 
&gt; found out today my fuel gauge is shot on the 66 micro.  AND it was a 6
&gt; volt original!  the mech.  specified that some 6v gauges would still
&gt; work even after the 12v. conversion.  is this true?

Yes.

&gt; I mean, it never
&gt; worked that well, was never properly calibrated, etc,

Sounds about right. After a couple of nice walks down the road to get
gas you'll learn where the Empty mark *really* is 8^).
