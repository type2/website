Hi Zac,

trust me... being a pure vintage enthusiast myself, I spent numerous hours
on this subject. Your best bet is to find a sale on a 195 75 14 (15 if it's
a real early bus). Our local &quot;Jim Martin&quot; tire company had a 195 75 14 white
wall made by Cooper for $18 plus mounting. This is a very clean looking tire
on any bus, the price is right, it's a whitewall, and you'll save yourself
mondo headaches.

It's virtually impossible to find the correct size tire for your bus. You
may be able to locate a tire close to the same width, but the height won't
match or vice versa.
The first number in tire sizes is the width. Second number is not a
measurement, but a percentage of the first width measurement to get the
actual height of the tire. And the last number of course is the rim size.
So a 195 75 14 is 195mm wide 146mm tall to fit a 14&quot; rim. From memory one
inch = 25.4 mm. So the described tire is approx. 7 1/2&quot; wide and 5 3/4&quot;
tall. I'm not sure of the exact height of the stock tires, but the width was
about 6 1/2&quot; (6.4 inches).  On my first bus restoration, I was very happy to
find a set of 175 75 14s not knowing how they would look once mounted. The
width was really great, but having only 75% of the 175 for height, made the
bus looking like it's shoes were too small. Kinda looked like the tires
low-riders use on those hydraulically rigged ghetto cruisers.

Look for the lowest first number, the highest second, the third to be the
size of your rim, and breath a sigh of relief.

Tom
