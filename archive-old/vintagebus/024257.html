Subject: RE: Height vs. Bus 

Rebecca,
My wife had the same problem with my '65, since she's also 4'11&quot;. Her
solution was to buy a '73, which she found plenty comfortable to drive.
I don't like it as much as my splitties, but VW did make some
significant &quot;improvements&quot; in the engine, brakes, suspension, etc. 

If some of the other suggestions don't pan out, you may want to
investigate this route. An earlier Loaf would have the old style (Type1)
engine. 

Let me know what you come up with, I may modify my '65 work-in-progress
so Carole can drive it.

-SNIP-
&gt;   I am 4'11&quot; tall and have a problem reaching the pedals.  I can either
&gt; sit on the edge of my seat to reach them, or slide the seat up so far
&gt; that the steering wheel crams into my stomach.  Does anyone have any
&gt; suggestions on how to remedy this problem?
&gt; Thanks! (no short jokes please, I've heard them all!)

BTW: Did you hear the one about the woman that was too short to reach
the pedals? Oh, you've heard that one... :)
