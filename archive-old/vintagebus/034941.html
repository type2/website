&lt;&lt; What I want to know is, what others have done to make a good seal or 
gasket for the screw-on bolt that holds the little tube into the bottom of 
the tank?  Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Drain fuel from tank.  Remove nut that holds on the feed pipe to the tank.  
Replace or clean sock shaped brass fuel filter and its washer gasket(111 209 
139).  Then reinstall feed pipe it's sealing washer gasket(311 201 235) and 
nut for the feed pipe.  These sealing gaskets are made out of a dense 
cardboard material and would be a pain to make.  Matbe some of the real 
oldtimers could tell you if you could use leather or some other material 
instead, but then you would probably would have to make tools to do the job 
right.  So instead just go down to your VW FLAPS and just buy these gaskets 
and the brass sock shaped filter.   Eric&amp;Barb
