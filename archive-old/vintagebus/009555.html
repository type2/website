&gt;I'm trying to sort out a mess of wiring under the dash and noticed this
&gt;little box with many wires protruding from it which looks very corroded.
&gt;What is this thing called so I can replace it and why don't I see it on
&gt;any of the wiring diagrams I have been able to find? The bus has been
&gt;converted to 12V, was this added then?


Are you sure it was converted? Maybe came that way? Does the little box have
twelve or so spade connectors on top? Lordy, if that's the
flasher/hazard/brakelight gizmo that's in 67's it's a pricey little booger.
To the tune of a hunnert dollars or so. Corroded is bad, but if it's working
you gotta love it. I think Ronnie from Havasu,  ronnie_at_ctaz_dot_com sells a
little wafer board that replaces it for forty or fifty bucks. Basically it's
function is to take all the turn signalling, brake lights, and hazard light
chores and make them all work in harmony. Got real intimate with one awhile
back. I heard that the reason it is there is because in Europe they require
the lights to illuminate instantly when you flip the turn signal lever, not
after the delay introduced by a thermal flasher unit. Don't know if true.
I've just used the wiring diagrams from an earlier bus and converted it to
the thermal flasher. Hazards are a problem, though. Takes three lighting
relays to do it from scratch, unless you can find a 5 pin relay for that
purpose in 12 volt. Very mind-numbing. I sleep now.
