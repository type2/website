Subject: westy spice rack ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a spice rack for my 65, but the top was missing.  The top horizontal 
piece and the hinged flap.   I want to repair it, and I have some pics, but I 
can't tell if it is the same fake wood stuff, or is it the white gridded 
stuff?   Thanks.

Clara
