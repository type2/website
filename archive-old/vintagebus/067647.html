Subject: Re: [VB]  WTB  complete gearshift housing for a '64 big nut

&gt; By reading the Bentley it looks like the gearshift housing comes off as one

Hi Lloyd,
Deburr the cut off end of the inner transmission shift lever.  Shift both 
trannies in nuetral and remove the nose cones off the trannies. Check both 
nose cones for tight unworn shift bushings.  Install the uncut inner 
transmission shift lever in the tightest bushed nose cone or one of the nose 
cones you have rebushed if needed.  Reinstall this nose cone on the later 
tranny and enjoy.
  Best to install the cut off inner tranny shift lever in the more worn nose 
cone and bolt them to the earlier tranny to help protect it from debris and 
water damage from getting into the innerds.
The bus transmission inner shift lever is the same as the bug and KG, but has 
a tapered hole drilled in the bottom instead of the top.  We have drilled 
these type 1 shift levers to work, but this takes a specially tapered drill 
bit that Eric is able to grind properly by hand and still it take a 1/8&quot; 
drill bit to clearance drill the center of this tapered hole to allow the tip 
of the tapered bolt not to prematurely bottom out when threaded in.  BD used 
type 1 inner tranny shift lever, but had an access plate under the rear seat 
to unbolt it!
