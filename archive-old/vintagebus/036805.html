 BBB IV is almost here, have had an overwhelming response from all over
the country, should be an awesome show and campout. Raffle prizes keep
coming in so the raffles will be awesome, a lot of great prizes, and
remember proceeds go to Arizona Home for  Abused Children.

The first production run of Platium bus seat covers are on there way to
me and i should have them installed in my 66 hardtop delux for you all
to check out at BBB IV,it's been a long wait and let's hope it's been
worth it.

See you all in a couple days!

ps. photo's of the event will be posted for those of you who couldn't
make it.
