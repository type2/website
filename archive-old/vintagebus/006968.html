You really need to specify WHICH reservoir you have in order to help solve
your problem. there are 6 different reservoirs out there that I know of.

1. metal with screw on top (generally only found on barndoors (?)
2. metal with rubber plug (like the bugs have)
both of these have internal nuts that bolt the reservoir to the master
cylinder.
3. aTe replacement M/C with plastic reservoir, also has internal nut
4. FAG replacement master cylinder, this also has a internal nut, but I have
seen some recently with the nut pressed in the plastic reservoir, where the
whole reservoir screws on.
5. plastic replacement reservoir with plastic threads
6. plastic replacement with a pressed on nut, flared in the reservoir and
sealed with an o-ring between the nut and the reservoir bottle.

Numbers 1 through 4 can be repaired and will work.
Numbers 5 and 6 go in the trash when leaking, especially number 6, The
biggest problem with these is that the owners or whoever checks the brake
fluid over tightens the cap and spins the bottle on the base, breaking the
seal between the nut and o-ring, when this happens they have become trash
can material, I have taken these apart and tried to repair by installing a
new o-ring and re flaring the top of the nut in the reservoir, but with no
luck.

&gt; My res is leaking right above
the screw that goes into the brake cyl. 

&lt;sounds like you have the aftermarket plastic one!

I dunno.  mine does too.  Oozes.  You know, there is supposed to be a squash

ring between the res and the MC.   I took my res off and cleaned and 
reinstalled with new ring and it still oozes.  Anyway, it is damp with brake

fluid.  maybe my res is bad   i didn't see anycracks in the res though. 
However, mine is not dripping.  I do occasionally look at it and the fluid 
level has not dropped.    Maybe it was a bad cap?   splash splash.  dunno.
