If the bug is 6v and the bus is 12v, and they are both
going to remain that way, then you need to change the
flywheel and check the end-play on the bus engine before 
you pop it into the bug.  If the bug has never had a 12v 
flywheel, then you'll also need to grind the bellhousing.

&gt; I need to temporarily swap engines between my bug and

&gt; a 12v DP 1600 from the bus and putting it into a 1966
&gt; 6v bug. I would like the bug to remain 6v.  Other than
&gt; the obvious (swapping generator, regulator, coil et
&gt; al.) what are the issues I might encounter?  Will the
&gt; 12v flywheel go in the 6v bell housing?  Will the
&gt; starter line up and work?  I have heard both good and
&gt; bad opinions and don't want to start until I have a
&gt; definite answer.
