Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Aluminum Engine cases!

What cases were you using?  were they H or B or AE or?   How many times had 
they been machined- I mean how over were your main bearings?

Did you have them machined to build a bigger displacement engine?  That 
weakens it by #3 unless it is welded I hear.

What cooler system?  What oil temps did you tend to run?  Do you live in a 
hot climate?

&lt;&lt; I just got back my bus from the shop and it has a cracked case.
 This is the second engine that I have had crack on me over &quot;3&quot; in 27,000
 miles and I am not sure what is going on but I am thinking of building
 my own and trying an aluminum case. The case is 20 bucks cheaper than
 the regular case but I am not sure if it is going to be good in the long
 haul. Any thoughts and is anyone using one.
