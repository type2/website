Hi fellow listees  -

I checked the archives but I guess it's been less than six months since the
tire issue was discussed.  Anyway, I just got off the phone with Jack at The
Tire Rack and he recommended the following tires for my Crew Cab:

Bridgestone 18580R14 - load range D, limit 1800 lbs - $65/tire
Michelin MX 18580R14 - load range C, limit 1540 lbs, stiffened sidewall  -
$65/tire
Yokohama 356 185?R14 (can't remember the a/r) - load range C, limit 1510
lbs - $49/tire

I'm leaning towards the Bridgestones, just wanted to make sure that they
were a good choice.  TIA for any and all opinions!

Paul
66 Crew (Fritz)
