&lt;&lt; onnie- does your brake warning lite normally come on with the
 engagement of the emergency brake ? or if it never did, is there 
 a switch for that up near the top and behiind / under the dash ? 
 and so is it wired and functional , etc..... &gt;&gt;

No, it doesn't work with the ebrake. You push on the light it self to test 
it. This morning I tested it. didn't work the first 2 or 3 times. then it 
worked about 17 out of 20 times. I should also clarify that the light does 
not come on only when the brake pedal is pressed, it comes on randomly while 
driving. Scared the sh*t out of me when it first happened, thought I was 
suddenly running out of fluid or something.
