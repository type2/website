Subject: New Singlecab bed

I'm having a new bed made for my 59 singlecab.
It's going to be around $500.00. The place is in my home town but 
known world wide for their work. They do mostly streetrod work but I 
went to school with the owner 30 years ago so he agreed to make the 
dies for my bed.
If you're interested in one let me know.
When I get mine home, in about a month i'll get some pictures posted.
You can see my truck at http://www.centralia.wednet_dot_edu/lytle/59sc.html
