check your cam bearings and cam bore
have come across this problem a few times and it
always turns out to be the cam
a lot of the cam bearings out there just don't always fit
i keep 3 brands in stock so if i have a problem with 1 i use the other
ie; german (don't always fit, especially in new cases) mahle (fit new
cases
great but a little off but will work in older cases and leve seem to
work
in about anything

just something to do

Hi list,
I am in the midst of rebuilding my first motor and am running into a
problem 
(other than the shop taking four weeks to get my heads done). I'm at
the case 
mantling stage, and when I torque the case perimeter hardware, the
crank gets 
harder to turn with the rods. It is fine when I torque the two small
nuts by 
the flywheel and the six big ones, but torquing the outer ones seem to
bind 
things up a tad. I can still spin the crank with the rods, but there is
some 
initial stickiness, and the idiot book says to stop if any binding
happens. I 
took the whole schmutz apart once already, and didn't find anything
wrong. 
Any ideas on what's up??
