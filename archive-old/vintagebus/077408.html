&gt; After pulling the trans after the initial install due to lack of gears and oil leaks from the axle retaining rings, I did the following:
&gt; (snip long list)
&gt; 
&gt; Front coupler set screw: MISSING! temporary replacement with sawed off M8 bolt. Where to find replacement? What type of screw original?
.........

available at VW FLAPS, and surely in the mail order catalogs too.   same pitch as the ubiquitous 13mm head bolts, can file point to make a set screw, but better to have a hole to wire the bolt to prevent it coming loose.

&gt; 
&gt; Now I have smooth shifting gears, reverse is no mystery. It's truly a beauty.

yay!!!!!!!!!!!

check accelerator cable adjustment at carb so it is not too tight or stepping on the gas all the way stresses the floor.  You can weld a patch in right, or do a hokey fix w/ drilling holes and bolting metal below and above floor to sandwich pedal attachment in place.  (BTDT, still works) and patch it properly later.

to adjust gas cable, have pedal all the way to floor (chunk of stuff, gallon jug of water,  or friends foot holds it down.)  go to cab and pull arm all the way open, attach cable.  

replace old windsheild seals if you haven't already.  curse PO who didn't, which allowed floor to rust.
