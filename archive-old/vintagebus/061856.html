  My '66 doesn't have any there. I had
&gt; this very problem in my '70 Beetle. Caused a line of rust right
&gt; across the middle of the door. There was tarpaper glued into the
&gt; inside of the door. 

FYI that was stock for a 70 beetle too.

Found two Westy camp stools in great condition at a garage sale.  Two
for 5 bucks...whooo hoo!
