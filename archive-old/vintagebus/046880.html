      This is a very strange but important subject and sort of a catch 22 at
that.  Do I stop and help or just jam on?  I have met some of the nicest VW
people on the shoulder of the road and I wouldn't trade these friendships for
the world.  But I must admit I was a little frightened to meet some of these
folks, the one that comes to mind is Tripper a 6'5&quot; Rastafarian mail man.  But
as it has been said you just get a feeling, learn to trust it.  You may also
get the opportunity to buy a VW!!
   Peace, Love, and Don't be a shoulder sitter-carry plenty of spares and a
CB,
        Mr. Bubble Head
