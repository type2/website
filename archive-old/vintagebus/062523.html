Hey everyone,

I am new to the list, and love to follow the trials and tribulations of
fellow members. Now,  I need some help, I have a standard 67=B9 that I
purchased about three months ago. When drove it for the first time and
applied the brakes it pulled heavily to one side. I knew then that it need
brake work. I have looked at the  whole system the best that I can, and now
need to jack it up and check the wheels. I have a floor jack and stands, bu=
t
do not know the proper way to use (where to place jack?) them with an old
bus. I don=B9t want to make a stupid mistake that will cause damage to my new
ride. Thanks for the help!

Tom May
