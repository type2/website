I agree with Scott. I've spent hundreds of hours over the years on carbs and
their idiosyncrasies. A lot of the major problems of the 34 PICT-3 have been
describe successfully in the many how-to's in the archives. Until the last few
years I was unaware of the blocking the butterfly hole trick and have since
incorporated it into all my rebuilds, including the 31 PICT with great
results. Starting out with a good carb and a good distributor is the only way
to get it right.

After watching this debate for a number of years also, each distributor/carb
combo has it's pros and cons. I am also thinking that the reason the
34PICT-3 combination and 009 distributor may be given a bad rap is that the
some of parts used may be well worn making the hesitiation and adjustment
issues worse and non-fixable. In my own case, it took a 3rd rebuilt 34
PICT-3 to work in conjunction with the 009 and get all the adjustments right
on the money. My carb is also not set &quot;fat&quot;, and the hesitation is not
there.... spark plugs, temp, exhaust color and mileage all proper.

My definition of &quot;fat&quot; is a vintage two barrel Bug Spray on a 1600 cc DP
getting 13 mpg.... wonderful!!
