Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum case update

Merry X-mas to All!

Craig- Diagnosis requires Details !
As I recall, you went through much trouble to get this far.
Problems with the case, crank gears, cam gear, etc....
Back in October you were having a problem with the cam gear
sticking once every 360 degrees. Did you solve that problem ?
Perhaps you should relist the problems and solutions for the
edification ( and enjoyment :) of the list, with an accounting
of the original plan, and the parts chosen to accomplish it.
If these problems stem from a malformed new aluminum case,
then it is becoming obvious that a proper case should be used.
If all new aluminum cases require superhuman skills, etc....
As for the specific complaint as listed in this thread, I would
examine the shimmed rocker hardware, and would have a
concern over the use of HD valve springs on stock rocker shafts
and the wavy washers used to align the rockers.
From the following repeated info, it sounds like you didn't
solve the problems and face more to come.
If the noise is internal, then that's the place to look !
Let's start with a list of engine components and a description
of modifications and tolerances. ( Refer to Ray Heath's sig line:)

Craig wrote ( Back in early October )-

another listee (lurker) sent me this the other day... NOT what i
wanted to hear, but good to know:

lurker wrote-
My entire summer was literally WASTED doing EXACTLY what is frustrating you
at the moment.  I bought a first-generation aluminum case (#1331), brand new
counter weighted crank, mild performance cam (Scat C-25), new EVERYTHING
(except rods &amp; heads) &amp; then spent every waking moment from May until
September wishing I had just align bored my old case &amp; thrown the old stuff
back in.  I know that Hot VW's did an article about the problems w/ this
case, but I still owe the list a huge write up to explain what it's going to
mean in terms of lost days, weeks, MONTHS out of your life when you buy one.
Unfortunately I'm a very slow typist &amp; it would take me a week to organize &amp;
make readable all of the problems &amp; the anger &amp; frustration that was
involved.  Plus, I'd rather repress the memory until I recover from the
experience.

I also had your problem of the binding cam gear even though I was replacing
a
&quot;zero&quot; gear w/ a &quot;zero.&quot;  After awhile (too long) it occurred to me to test
my old cam in the new case &amp; it did not bind.  (At that point I decided it
must have been a manufacturing flaw w/ the Scat cam gear, but after hearing
your story I'm not sure any more.)  So even though I don't know WHY it
worked, I solved my cam gear problem by drilling out the rivets on my OLD
cam
gear &amp; riveting it onto the new cam, which luckily had a gear which was also
riveted on.  (It took 2 days of driving to specialty tool shops all over
town
to find replacement rivets.  That's the kind of thing I wasted my summer
doing.)  It's possible that my case may not have been as out of spec as
yours, because just reusing the old gear took care of that problem.  But
that
was only AFTER full assembly &amp; firing up the engine, only to watch it lock
up
after 5 min because the cam gear was binding &amp; forcing the crank rearward,
which eliminated end play AT ONLY ONE PLACE IN EACH CAM GEAR ROTATION -- AS
YOU ALSO ARE EXPERIENCING.   By the way, have you checked the clearance
you're going to have between cam gear &amp; oil pump after it's installed?
There
wasn't ANY on my piece of shit case &amp; after the oil pump nuts were tightened
the crank was immovable.  Oh, and the counterweighted crank couldn't make
half a rotation w/out hitting the case.  It sounds like you don't have this
problem, which just goes to prove how variable the machining was for these
things.

Craig wrote-
sadly, i don't have his option; my old cam gear is a 4-bolter, the
schneider cam is a 3-bolt.
unless i want to ditch the $80 schneider cam and stay stock.

i'm not sure what to do now, tho a trip to a certain vw case
'factory' with a baseball bat comes to mind.

any other aluminum case users lurking out there who have SOLVED the
cam problem????

&gt; It kind of sounds like the top of the lifter bores needed to be decked and
&gt; chamfered like you do for after market high lift cams.

&gt;
&gt; so the motor is in the car and running... but has a problem:
&gt;   we took a listening tube and spent an hour tracking a loud noise in
&gt; the aluminum engine. DEFINITELY internal,  along the lifter area on
&gt; the right side. either something is banging into the case, or the
&gt; (solid) lifters have a problem on the pushrod end. i clearanced,
&gt; miked and decked the hell outa this motor, so if its a clearance
&gt; issue, it is due to a nonspec case.
&gt;
&gt; it SOUNDS like it is ONCE per valve opening...  not as fast as the
&gt; engine rpms.  perhaps a lifter is hitting something; or while the
&gt; pushrods are not FLEXING as bad as EX #1 once did, but still one is
&gt; not right in the lifter cup, and is rattling around.
&gt; if i take the pushrods off of each cylinder in turn, the noise should
&gt; go away IF the pushrods are the problem (do i pull the sparkplug on
&gt; that cylinder for this test, or just the wire)?
&gt; if the noise doesn't go away, i;m f*cked. no tips for the holidays :P
&gt;
&gt; other than that, it runs great :)
