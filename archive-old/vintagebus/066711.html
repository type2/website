Subject: Re: [VB] frozen door handles

Kevin-
This may sound a bit crazy but have you tried Pam the non stick
spray stuff
for cooking? I use it in my freezer because the moisture drain
is plugged
and it builds ice in the bottom of my freezer then leaks water
on the floor
telling me it is time to de-ice. Before it was a pita to get the
ice out
(frozen in it is the bottom wire bin). I would have to pry it
out with the
broom and chip out the leftovers. So I sprayed it with Pam and
now it pulls
out pretty easy. Maybe spraying the handle with Pam the moisture
won't stick
to it when it freezes. Hey it might work and for about $4 if it
don't you
can use it to cook with. Living in So. Cali my freezer is as
close as I plan
to get to a frozen door handle.....lol.
Bob
