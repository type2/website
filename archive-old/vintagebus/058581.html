Subject: Wanted:  light weight trailer

Well,

Going on a long trip this summer and I need to procure a light weight
camping trailer (Scamp, Burro, Puck or some such).  Anybody have any leads.
 I need one that will sleep two adults and two little ones, so
unfortunately I think the Puck is out.  I need something I can pull with
the crew cab and also with the Astro V6.

Anyone with experience with the Scamp or Burro in regards to the best size,
features, price?   Websites to check out?

Thanks!

Steve
