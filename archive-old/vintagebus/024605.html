My feet are still thawing out!  

I saw that split window bug sans tail lights.  I was wondering if the
owner was just being careful or if they got ripped off durring the
night.  That sucks! That just goes to prove my pomona theory.  If its
not bolted down, it will walk away. 

I spoke with a couple from OC that had never been there before.  Durring
the night, they lost about $200 worth of things.

I picked up a set of stock P&amp;C's for cheep, but one got a little wet. 
They are new and have the factory coating on them.  When I got home I
dried it off and sprayed it with a light oil.  That should be good at
keeping it rust free....no??

BTW met Ronnie...nuf said ;-)
