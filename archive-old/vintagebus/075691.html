Subject: Re: [VB] Bigger rubber bump-stops on axels...how do they mount?

Actually, there are (or were, in your case) four or five clips arranged in
a circle, which grip the hole in the bottom of the rubber thing. You could
check out a photo online somewhere, or maybe in the Bentley shop book, and
possibly weld something together to dupe it.

When my right side torsion bar suddenly snapped back in 88, my bus had to
run 200 miles on the bumper til I could get to where I needed to be to do
the repair. I always keep the bumpers maintained in case it happens again.
I haven't a clue what it would have been like if the rubber wasn't there.

&gt; &gt; I have both rubber bumpers that sit on the axels, but one came off in my hand.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Was there a shaft or something that was in the center of
&gt; &gt; the dish that the bumper sat one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If there was, said shaft is no more.
