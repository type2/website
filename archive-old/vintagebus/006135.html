These guys are &quot;trained professionals&quot;. That's the stuff they feed you in
every commercial. I never took any of my ACVW's to anywhere near these
places but went there with my modified off-road rig a few times. It's OK for
them to change oil but I just let them know at the beginning that I don't
want them to touch anything except oil related parts and fill window washer
fluid. I've heard some horror stories from the guy that worked at one of
these joints. Sometimes cars leave these places with no oil in the engine or
loose filters.

Just me,

Andre

&gt; &gt; I wonder what kind of meltdown they'd go into if you took a Bus in
&gt; &gt; there?  Nine zerks (to be greased with the wheels off the ground),
&gt; &gt; three gear oil places, battery, no oil filter...Make 'em *earn*
&gt; &gt; their $19.95!  :)  Bonus points if it takes them more than five
&gt; &gt; minutes to figure out how to open the church-key engine lid...
