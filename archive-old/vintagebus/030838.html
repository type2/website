Subject: My Latest Project 

I've been kind of quiet on the list recently, with my time and energies going to
another project.  On the bus front, you can read that as my Double cab is running
GREAT and I'm not having to do anything much other than drive it and change
fluids.

Since Busmeister Thom, announced that Easter Sunday := Friday, I figured I'd post
a few links to my current project.

I started off by building up a 355 SBC with TPI injection, the engine/trans came
out of an 88 vette.  I was ready to drop it in, when I figured that I would paint
the engine compartment.  The engine compartment came out so nice, that I figured,
OK let's do this right and paint the whole car.  Inside and out.  SO out came the
interior.  I figured out how to remove all the chrome off of the vehicle. (This
car has more chrome on it than a complete show of VW chromed out bugs.)  Then I
started thinking.  Hmmmm....  It'd be nice to have a sunroof.  I located a sunroof
in a junkyard on an 1985 Jaguar, I went for it and &quot;off with its head&quot;  and drug
the roof and sunroof home with me.  The photos are of my progress on that portion.

BTW, a &quot;lump&quot; is the term given to Jaguars with non-Jag engines in them.  There is
argument as to the origination of the term, but to those who ride in a &quot;lumped&quot;
jag, it is a term of endearment, to those who feel that it is a sin against
creation to &quot;lump&quot; a vehicle, it is a term of derision.  Sounds much like the
custom/stock wars (woops, heated discussions) here on the bus list.

Once I get the jag on the road, I'll be parking the DC and doing a little
finishing work on it.
