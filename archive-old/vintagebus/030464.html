Subject: Looking for Jamie Rivers?

HI all

I had some problems with my modem... and ended up with a backup tape
that the tape drive ate!!

So... If you could send me a message, I can add your email address
again!

Thanks!

Also,,, If anyone still has their reply to me about &quot;today's fuels&quot;.. I
would be real happy to have those comments back on file!! 
I am trying to compose some Facts and opinions on Why so many T4 valve
seats drop and T1 #3 exhaust valve heads pop off seemingly new condition
engines 
THANKS!!
