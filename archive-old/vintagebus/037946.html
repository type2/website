Slightly similar to that of the beetle yet they are square and contain a 
screen.  They are right above the lower hinge about 3 to 4 inches and about 
the same from the front of the door.  They appear to be a barndoor only item, 
possibly African only?  Any of you have any information on what market these 
were for and from what years?
