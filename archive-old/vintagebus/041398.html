When I think about it I think, hey I run 1600 engines, parts are easy to
get.  I run small-nut drums.  How easy are they to get nowdays? This
brings me to a question I had been thinking about lately.  Would it be
possible to build up the worn away surface inside the drum by some
electro-spray type process and then re-turn the drums?  
Right now I guess you can get NOS drums for $150 which might be cheaper
than the above, but I was thinking what to do if you couldn't get drums at
all.
