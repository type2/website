Hi Steve,
113 means it was for deluxe bug originally, but this does not mean it was 
never used on buses or type 3s or other VW types.  323 means by the first numeral 
&quot;3&quot; is the Main Group, that it is a tranny part, the next two numerals are 
the Sub-group.  731 is the Part Designation, and B is the Modification letter.  
  Checking out our 1960s type 1 parts manual does not go as high as 23 Main 
Group.  Our 1970s type 1 parts manual does go that high but not as high as 731 
Part Designation.
