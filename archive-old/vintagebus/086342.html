Subject: Re: [VB] Question about Intake Manifolds

turn it up side down and hold it in a vise.  
pour
 
****water****
 
in the little pipes.
 
Next day, put a piece of clutch cable in a drill, and spin backwards.   The water is a great solvent and  softens up the carbon really well.
Having the heat riser clear is important, and not too hard to do with the right technique.   It warms up the air going into the heads, and helps against manifold icing.

Folks-- 
 
I've never had to deal with this issue before, please forgive my ignorance. 
 
I have a 1500 in my bus, and the smaller diameter 
pipe of the intake manifold has a hole it it 
(these are the ends that attach to the muffler 
base). I bought a replacement manifold, but was 
told that the new one was &quot;blocked.&quot; Sure enough, 
very little air passes from one end to the other 
on the smaller pipe (the larger pipes that go to 
the head are clear). How important is it that it 
be clear, what is it's function, how can it be cleared? 
 
I tried hanger wire and mechanics wire, but had 
an impossible time getting the wires to go past 
the curves in the pipe. A little carbon came 
out--hardly any. I got better results lightly 
tapping on it with a hammer--but still not a lot came out.
