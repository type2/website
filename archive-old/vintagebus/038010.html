Good question ...?

There definitely should be one on both front doors.


I'll ask Lenny, what the f ''  s  up..:-)

The hole doesn't appear to be there either.??
-  --- -- 
did not look at the pic myself, but ya I do believe they wood have bumpers on 
both front doors and behind both rear cargo doors.   

but.... ever noticed how the area around the bumpers gets pushed in?   when I 
did bodywork on and painted my 65, 3 out of the 4 holes for the bumpers were 
smoothed over and painted- looked like they were not there.   only recently 
did I carefully measre where they sould be, drill and tap and find them, and 
installed new bumpers  on the cargo doors and behind the cargo door- still 
haven't for the front door yet.  

just think... this could happen to you.

I like having the bumpers for the rear door, as I dont worry when someone els 
eopens it- I used to put arag in over the top hinge so the door would wdge on 
the rag and not band on the body.  I have the strap for the front door, so 
whatever.
