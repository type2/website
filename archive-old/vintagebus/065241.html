Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt batteries

That was my experience when the Optima in my 911 went dead.  Before I
could make a claim, I had to undergo a convoluted charging regimen,
and if that didn't work, I would have to send it in for 'evaluation'
at which point they woudl decide if I deserved a new battery or not.
And nobody could tell me how long the 'evaluation' would take - so my
car would be battery-less in the mean time.

I was a big fan of the Optima until then.  The one in the bus works
great, but the one in the 911 goes dead if it's not used for a week
or so - even if it's disconnected.  The bus has sat upwards of 3 months
and fires right up.

&gt; I've also heard of premature failures and slow warranty adjustments
&gt; including Optima insisting that the failed battery be returned for
&gt; &quot;inspection&quot; before an adjustment was authorized.  Unless you really
&gt; _need_ the sealed technology, you're better off buying a Pep Boys battery
&gt; for 1/3 the price and putting it in a battery box.
