Subject: Sundial repro tent for sale/trade
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there list---
A while back I bought a Sundial tent that consists of awning, sides, and 
poles for my '59 Panel from Dawn _at_PLF...
I haven't used it yet, and as a matter of fact, haven't even taken the tent 
out of it's
plastic bag. This is a tent of very high quality and is brand new. It is red 
and white striped (3 inches wide) and is an exact replica. You can see pics 
of them at www.plfvw_dot_com in the campmobile section (I hope you don't mind I'm 
putting your link up Dawn?)  It comes w/ an optional canvas pole bag and a 
tent bag as well (Lists for 425$ w/ out the pole bag) So anyway... I haven't 
and probably won't get the use out of it that it deserve, so, I'd like to 
trade it for a few interesting parts that I'm looking for:

I'm looking for a nice original sloped Westy roofrack or any og westy 
woodslat rack in really nice shape (ladders are definately a plus as well!),  
nice and complete og safari widows, or any other rare bus parts/ accessories 
that you may think would be of interest to me...

I will bring it to BNNTA next weekend if you'd like to exchange there???? I'd 
like this tent to be used!!!
I'll wait to put this on Everett's site until I give some time for replies...
Thanks alot and sorry 'bout the bandwidth-
Take care,
Pete
