I didnt know that story, but it sounds interesting and I'd love to see a
picture of it if anyone digs one up. I dont live in So Cal anymore but thats
my fav burger joint whenever I go back for visits.

&gt; Reading my stepdaughter's work mag from In-N-Out;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Jon has been a part of In-N-Out Burger since 1966, when Harry Snyder
first
&gt; contacted him to make signs for the company.&quot;
&gt; &quot;Jon's first job was to put a sign on Harry's old Volkswagen work truck.
&gt; Harry wanted the letters printed backwards on the front so that when he
was
&gt; driving behind cars on the road they would be able to read the sign in
their
&gt; rear view mirror.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; So In-N-Out had a VW truck (singlecab)? Pre 1966, where is it now with its
&gt; neat decals?
&gt;
