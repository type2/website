&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I thought it was funny watching the TNN James Bond marathon last week -
&gt; they were showing From Russia With Love, and a red/white deluxe
&gt; followed James home from the Istanbul airport, showed up in the scene
&gt; when the taxi let James out at the hotel, then showed up again the next
&gt; day when he left the hotel. I think that was one of the best parts of
&gt; the movie...

In &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; there is a splitty in the background as Bond is
conversing with the CIA man posing as a customs agent at the airport.  It
disappears between camera cuts.
