Subject: Jerome

I wondered what the line of busses on the road to the campsite was all about.

Not having a running bus (actually not even assembled!) my daughter and I
flew over to Jerome on Saturday.  As we wer arriving, we orbited a couple
of times over the camp site and my daughter spotted the line on the hill.
We thought maybe the campsite was full!  We're new to this, we'll learn!

Enjoyed meeting a few listees, and taking in the event!  Well done.
