Last week I installed a brand new generator in my 64,because the bearing
sounded loud and the gen. light was faintly coming on.After reinstaling
motor, gen. light was still on, so I install a NOS voltage regulator ( yes I
know volt. reg. are still available but I had acquired this Bosch volt. reg.
in a big parts deal, and it was old but still in its original box and was
definetely new ! ( new, old, and in my stock)
Any way, after installing the new volt reg. the gen. light was not on so I
took off down the highway only to have the voltage reg. fry my new generator
in a matter of 5 miles.Melted all the wax (? ) off the windings.
        This did allow me the oppurtunity to rebuild my first
generator,myself.It was pretty easy and only cost me $9(bearings).I did have
the advantage of a Vw. repair shop at my disposal.

new old stock or new old sh%t, some items that are still in there original
boxes are defects that were never returned or hooked up wrong and set back
on the self or who knows.My point is electrical items you just don;t know
unless you test them first, which was my mistake!

        my 2 cents( meine 2 pfennige)

drives
&gt; &gt;normally.  Weird, I think I got a bum switch...
