RobK :
yer a better man than me if you can roll
1/2 &quot; stock around a 2&quot; pipe.
i thought about the pivot thing and realized that
a straight bar won't work on the bus- too much
body curve,  and the longer extensions required
to use a straight bar or pipe will not be able to
accomodate the idea of hiding the rig behind the
bumper, adding support to a very flimsy piece of
&quot;crash protection &quot;.
actually would have liked the apparatus folded into
the bumper skin, as it is it rides behind the oem
brackets, and won't prevent dents from old ladies
who like to park by braille...
