Humm.  I was just going to ask about jets.

I've been trying to fix my slight stumble with my 30/31.  I'm running a stock dual vacuum dual advance dist. on a stock 1600 DP motor.  130 main and 55 idle jets (this is the funky two jet version).  Plugs are a nice light gray/brown.  One more thing.  When the choke was adjusted way too much the bus ran perfect with no stumble.

I went down to my favorite VW FLAPS Topline performance in Anaheim.  John is always more than willing to help and his prices are reasonable.  Anyway, we discussed the problem and decided to ream the 55 main idle jet to 60.  This seemed to help a bit, but not completely gone.  

My question is this.  Which idle jet does what?  Is the front jet (FIF) the main idle jet?  Do I need to keep both of them the same size?   How big should I go?  What is the purpose of the second idle jet?  

John says the set up I currently have usually works perfect.  Does it matter which hose goes where from the dual vacuum dist. to the carb?
