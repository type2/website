I had a good Pomona too.  Was very surprised to see so few people early.  I
got there about 6am.  Usually 6 is very late for the deals, but today must
have been my day.  I first spotted a VW dealer valve spring compressor
VW311h  (pic in Bentley   M-6 page 8) .  It even had the extra arm for 36hp
heads.  The guy wanted $50.  I walked on since it was early.  Next I found
the guys from Barett Ent. They were selling off the last of their going out
of biz stuff.  Picked up a set of 85.5 German KS P/C's for $60. They also
had a NOS German universal case still in cosmoline (the KS p/c's and the
case were the old mans personal stash he decided to part with).  Walked a
few isles and found a complete Westy rack with clamps.  Looked at it and
couldn't determine if it was a repop(I'm a novice at racks :-( ).  I
couldn't believe it was sitting there.  The guy who owned it (who wasn't at
the space at that time) was asking $300.  Not knowing if it was real, I
walked away.  Just then one of the less savory regular sellers walked up
with a buddy and promptly bought it.  This one would have needed another
$150 in restoration costs.  Oh well.  There's always nice new repros....now.

Walked over to Ronnie and mentioned the case and what they wanted for it and
also mentioned the compressor.  He said I should of bought them at that
price, and that they were most likely gone by now.  Well, went back just in
time.  I got there and asked the old man the price and just then two
different people tried to buy it while I was standing over it.   I figured
it must have been a good deal, so I bought it.  Then stopped by the guy with
the compressor and he still had it... low balled him, and I got it.

 I also picked up some tin a set of splash pans for $5, a washer bottle with
top(cracked) for $5 and some misc. tin, and a thermo and bracket for a
buck.    Stopped by Ronnies again to pick up the muffler I asked him to
bring (and show off the case and compressor). Thanks Ronnie.

Boy, today was a good day.  Good thing I brought my birthday money!  Almost
all gone now though.  Best Pomona I've had in a looooong time.
