Well, after my last whiney post, I figured I'd better follow it up with the
good news.

I got the gas tank and engine back in this morning with very little trouble.
The clutch had been getting really stiff, and Id' read a post on here about
lubing the clutch assembly.  I decided instead of slapping things back
together in a big hurry to get to a VW club meeting, I'd skip the meeting,
take my time and get some stuff taken care of.  I'm glad I did.

I took the clutch pedal assembly apart an took some 400 grit sandpaper to
the shaft and the inside of the tube, added a squirt of grease and voila!
The difference was absolutely amazing.  I've found that many older car
drivers, myself included, fall into that &quot;it's old, that's just the way it
is&quot; syndrome.  But usually that's not the case.  It shouldn't take both feet
to push in the clutch, and you shouldn't have to pull it back up.  It works
like a dream now.  Slicker'n snot on a pump handle...  If you have a sticky
clutch, take care of it.  It's a 10 minute fix, and well worth the time.

I took her out on the road just before dark, and everything is A-OK!  Now I
just have to get wipers on it, and work out a few electrical problems.  And
then there's the body work and paint.  Oh, yeah I guess I've got a bit of
work on the interior.  And the gas heater installation...  Other than that,
I'm almost done! ;-)  Like I'll ever be done.  I just keep telling myself
that it's the journey, not the destination...

Keep on wrenchin' and try to do some driving too,
