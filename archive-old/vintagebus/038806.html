I go to Germany on vacation nearly every year and the last time I was there
I picked up a couple of magazines called &quot;VW WOB!&quot; and &quot;VW Scene&quot; (auf
deutsch, of course) and they had buttloads of VWs for sale.  You may have to
sift through a lot of water-cooled stuff, but I think you may find a lot of
&quot;luftgekuelt&quot; ones there too and with the dollar being so strong you should
be able to get a good deal on your Bulli.

On a side note...  I would look in Sweden for old cars.  I was there last
summer and noticed a lot more old and special interest cars than in Germany.
There was even an old Studebaker Hawk stored in a barn on the farm where we
stayed, as well as an Olds Cutlass and several old Volvos.  I even found and
old 195x Kombi rusting away in the woods beyond repair.  I wanted to cut out
the tail-lights but I had neither the time nor tools.  Sweden is very close
to Germany and the people are friendly, the women beautiful but the beer
awful.  Be sure to bring your own stash (we brought a few cases of
Koestritzer &amp; Flensburger) as Swedish beer is even worse than American
beer(except some microbrews), if that is possible.

I always wanted to bring a Trabi home from the former DDR, as there would be
no other ones in Chicago that I know of.  Happy hunting.

Subject: [VB] crewcab (in Europe) needed


US government employee (me) will be leaving Europe (Germany) shortly, and I
would like to take back to the states with me (shipping is free... one
vehicle only) a 195? - 196? split screen CREWCAB.

Have cash and trades to aquire the vehicle, and SHOULD be running
condition.... at least enough to get it on and off the boat.

ANY leads or connections would be GREATLY appreciated.
