&lt;&lt; Hi all, a local college student here in my town called me with a
      request for help.  He has a '61 Westy that he MUST sell soon as he is
      moving to D.C. and unable to take it with him and won't need a car
      where he's going and needs the money.  He wants to know a reasonable
      price to ask and I am unable to make a decent guess, not having been
      interested in the market, other than parts, for a long time.  Can
      anyone help?

      '61 Westy, daily driver, 6 volt 1200 motor, Dove Blue, complete SO34
      interior with complete side tent and child's cot, needs minor body
      work. &gt;&gt;

Dan called me the other night with the same questions, and he has come to the
conclusion that he would like to ask 4000.
Here is what Dan told, and I quote  &quot;1961 westfalia camper, daily driver,
still 6V w/ 40hp 1200.  needs minor body attn and paint.  SO-34 camper
interior complete and 95% orig. wood.  includes complete side tent w/ all
poles, stakes, and bag.  child cot etc.
i am probably forgetting stuff but you get the idea &quot;

I know that I sold him the curtain rod that goes between the front and back,
it has a bump in the nose, and the drip rail is getting in need of attention,
not real bad though. Still in the Original Dove Blue, some touch ups in
places, no cuts or modifications. He even won a trophy in the camper class at
the 2nd Bulli Brigade, those trophies were awarded by bus drivers. You can
contact him at Vespa76_at_aol_dot_com his name is Dan.
                        Mike
