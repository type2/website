&gt;&gt;hi all,
&gt;

Hi.

&gt;We returned successfully from our adventure,


&gt;* Turning 63-6400 RPM at 60


Holy crap is that a mistype?


&gt;* Transaxle geared too high. 6300 at 60 might be off, i *think i have a
&gt;64-66 tranny with 27 inch tires but it could be 67 gearing?? i am going to
&gt;put a small nut back in on principle I think.


Everyone is going to talk about this. That rpm is way to high!!!!
You are lucky to have gotten anywhere!.
