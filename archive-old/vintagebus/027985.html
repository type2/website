Craig Spaeth &lt;spaeth_at_gorge_dot_net&gt;made several good
points.

My intention was to foster discussion and stir up the
list. I am sure that the current owner is a great
person and does exceptionally nice work. It would be
totally improper for me to cap on him, his vehicle or
mess up his efforts to market his creation. I have
never seen the bus and have no basis on which to make
a definitive judgment call- just like all of the
droves of critics who never inspected my buses. Most
of the critics wouldn't know what attributes/criteria
they were looking for or appreciate it if they saw
them.

In a backhanded sort of way I might be drawing more
attention to the bus! =) Craig, Ronnie, myself and
many others agree that the idea of a DD-walkthru-panel
w/barndoor front roof is decidedly unique and
creative. It would be more cool if and when finished.
When I said to give credit to a &quot;professionally
executed AND completed, well presented and creative
cookiecutter) custom&quot; I meant completed to a
professional quality regardless where the work is done
or regardless what the laborer does for their fulltime
career. 

I am no stranger to selling off a bus in a need basis
and a change of needs basis. No intention or
implication was made regarding requiring finishing off
that bus or any other prior to a sale... Just price
the vehicle or any other according to it's current
condition. My suggestion was that for the current
asking price and the potential &quot;$40,000.00&quot; worth that
Ronnie proposed- the suckah should be dialed in and
tricked out for the high end. I was floating the idea
that the actual effort and capital outlay to do a
project is more of a challenge than casually making a
suggestion. Kind of a Missouri &quot;show me&quot; kind of a
thing. (Dinero communincation vs. mobile bovine fecal
matter.)

Craig mentioned that &quot;If the vehicle sells it must
have the right to command such a high price. There is
no 'effort to pump prices' it is strictly a popularity
thing.&quot; 

I partially agree/disagree. If anything sells then it
must be worth it to the buyer. Correct~ or the buyer
is a fool. The degree of foolishness based on each
person's current need/value position. Prices are
actively being pumped all of the time. Ebay, buying
interests from whatever planet or resparked interest
via the NewBeetle. Some of it to me smells of greed
and pushing the envelope of common sense. 
After years and years of being in the VW scene I feel
that I have been priced right out of the market. When
comparing the effort required in correcting (or
restoring) and maintaining the mechanicals of a basic
aircooled to be used as a dependable daily driver
against the costs in time and money *for my* current
needs- I feel that the &quot;value&quot; is not there *for me*
any longer.

I have always encouraged everyone to participate and
enjoy their VWs. My feeling is that the adjustments
that I have made away from daily driving aircooled
splittie bus 365 days will restore my enthusiasm for
and enjoyment of the scene. We still have the '67
Westy and the trailer. In that light, the family is
still very much into the bus scene. I'm just glad that
I am not in a buying mode at the moment. I could not
afford it.
