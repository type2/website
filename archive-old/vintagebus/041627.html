&gt; The threads in the case for one of my oil strainer studs is stripped (PO did
&gt; it) :-).  Is there anyway to tap it for an oversized stud and not get
&gt; shavings in the case without tearing it apart?  I know gravity is on my side
&gt; but.....

I did it in an emergency on the road in an Ace Hardware parking lot. The
leftover oil in the sump will run down the tap and flush it as you go if
youre careful and clean the tap as you go you can do it no problem.
