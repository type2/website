Subject: RE: [VB] Score! jealous

You know I just got a call about the same sort of thing, a guy in Florida
just got a 23 window in about the same deal 1000 dollars, he called it a 7/8
on a scale of 1 to 10, that made me jealous, but I'm glad they are still out
there like that.

Subject: [VB] Score! jealous


I'm a mechanic in southern New York at a small shop, and we do alot of work
on air-cooled VW'S because my boss and I love them. Well, anyways. A new
customer just towed in a 1967 bus today that he just purchased from the
original owner. It is &quot;rust free&quot; and absolutly georgeous! the right front
door was hit and besides that 100%. The original owner stated that he never
washed it. It was hidden up on blocks for 15 years in a barn in the Bronx.
Oh! did I mention that it was only 81,000 miles on it! OK all, here is the
kicker...are you sitting down? They bought it for....$1,000. oh I am soooo
jealous!!
