Subject: Re: [VB] 28MPG on freeway in Frodo the 65 Westy?

&gt;I can tell you right now Steve that Terry's Westy is bone stock.  28 PICT
&gt;carb and 40 horse engine.  Bone bone stock - slow up the hills in some
&gt;cases.  He cruised 65 with wind at his back and his bus was very happy on
&gt;the return trip.  That's how he got his mileage! :-)

Yeah, I'd have to agree with that.  My '63's got the optional 1500SP and, 
altho it's now 12V, it's still running the original 28 PICT carb and stock 
exhaust.  

I haven't taken any really long hauls to check how well my MPG is doing, 
but the last semi-long trip I made (380mi RT) I think I averaged around 
23MPG.
