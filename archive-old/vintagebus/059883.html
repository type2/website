Subject: Re: [VB] Car Wax

Mequiars has a pretty neat online tool to determine which of their products
is appropriate. The rest of the site is pretty informative as well.

Go to http://www.meguiars_dot_com/CarRx.cfm

Mequiars is good stuff. Body shops will almost always use either 3M or
Mequiars.

Can someone recommend a good wax for a restored 66 21 window?  I don't mind
paying a bit more for the product if it is worth it.  Thanks all.  66Samba
