Subject: [VB] Fire damage, etc. What to do.........
Message-ID: &lt;3815113C.5CBCAD9D_at_vintagewarehouse_dot_com&gt;

I'm looking for some input from the list on this one.

This weekend I picked up a (at one time) very nice '60 Panel.
Front and rear safaris, wolfgang rear, adjustable beam, ragtop,
Westy rack, on and on...
Problem is about 5 months ago the barn/shop it was in burnt to
the ground and the Bus is very bad as well. It was given to me
with some other VW related items as part of a &quot;if you take it,
you can have it&quot; cleaning on the property. The rack and the roof
were pretty much wasted, but the safaris I managed to save, they
need new glass and latches, but no problem there. The beam looks
like it'll be ok with a good cleaning, new seals, brake
components and grease. What I'm concerned with is the transaxle.
The fire was hot enough to melt the brake hoses, axle boots, etc.
Do you think with the same good cleaning, seal change and brake
parts replacement it'll be useable? The motor that was in the Bus
has since gone through the same treatment and seems to be doing
fine.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg
