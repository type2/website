I went back to check out this bus again.  Steering is actually not that
bad (maybe 3&quot; play at the rim of the steering wheel) and seems to track
well.  The shift lever is another story -- loose as a goose.  Question:
can the coupler be replaced easily? I hope it's not inside the
transaxle.

I noticed the passenger side seat belt anchor was hanging down into the
front wheel well.  The surrounding metal seems pretty solid, but there
is a 3&quot;x2&quot; hole where the anchor was.  I'm tempted to offer $1200 (and
maybe go to $1300) because it runs so well and has such a straight
body.  Also, the brakes were done completely last year (shoes, wheel
cylinders and master cylinder.  I figure if I do the minor body work and
paint prep myself, spend $1500 on interior, paint, and miscellaneous
rust repair, I'll have a very nice bus for less than $3000 invested.  Is
this realistic? What does the list think?
