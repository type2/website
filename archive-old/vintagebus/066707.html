Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

Thom-
In Long Beach there is Transform (2105 W. Cowles St., Long Beach, Ca. 90813
Phone# 562-435-2966 / 800-508-7267). I use Transform for all my trannies.
They do quality work and back up their warranty. Turn around is great too. I
took them my '61 SC trans after I blew it into 2 pieces. I called them on
Saturday around 11am and they said to bring it down. So I loaded it up(both
chunks) and dropped it off. I had them build me a freeway flier w/ new
bearings in the reduction boxes and install the axles. Tuesday around noon
they called and it was ready to go. $750 out the door w/ 5 year warranty and
no core charge for the 2 piece tunnel case...lol. That also included a new
nose cone. The trans was smooth as silk and in the 2 years after I put the
trans in NOT 1 problem ever with it. I use my SC as a daily driver and
worked it's ass off.

Transform has been around for allot of years and puts out a quality product.
Well worth the time to give them a shout. As soon as I land a big nut trans
for my Kombi I will be paying them a visit.
