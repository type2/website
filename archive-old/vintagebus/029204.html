What super bus do you all drive?  This sounds more like Ronnie's speeds in a
fully prepared bus, not just bought with unknowns.
We have been on the road going on two months and one 600 mile day (with 500 miles
on I 80) was 33 mph average (SLC Ut. to Tahoe Ca.)

We are looking for a bus to drive to Cancun and back? Dec -Jan or a caravan

&gt; &lt;&lt; A week (Friday night until the next Sunday - 9 days of driving) doesn't
&gt; seem too short to expect to go 2500 miles, does it?  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; eight days to divide 2500 miles which works out to about 300 miles a day.  At
&gt; about a 50 MPH average you will need to drive six hours each day.
