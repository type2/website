Subject: RE: Tent Question

First off this is exactly the dilemma I am faced with. I have an NOS Tent I
just bought for my 61 flit seat. Of course I also would love to use it on
the 23 window. I figure I could ad the hole on the rear bumper and the
bracket on the front bumper. then for the top, take 2 inch strapping steel
(sheet metal on a role) and fashion two straps to cross over the bus
connecting to the drip rails, install a set of donor westy top brackets to
them and then pad the bottom of the strap with self sticking neoprene. I
figure then I could just roll up and store the straps with the tent and only
install them when it was time to set the thing up.
