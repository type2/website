Subject: Re: [VB] NOS door question

 A beautiful nov 60 through dec 63 door!  For the pull handle, you see.  It 
was not an oversight that the other hole wasn't drilled.  Takes a differnt 
door mecanism too.    I have a beautiful 67 drivers door I'll trade you for 
it.  That door would be great on my 61.
