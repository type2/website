Subject: broken clutch bolt

Hi All,

While swapping clutches tonight, on tightning the final of the six 
bolts, I snapped it off:(  My main reason for doing the swap in the 
first place is to check the tranny in the non mobile 65.  Will that one 
snapped off bolt cause havoc, even just driving it around the block a 
few times?  If so, it seems I now need to swap flywheels also, or drill 
out and re-tap the hole.  I had already broken my 3/4 ratchet, and bent 
an angle iron breaker bar trying to remove flywheel from dead engine, 
so I've got my work cut out for me either way.

Any experiences/advice on how to proceed?

TIA
Don J
