Scott,

Anybody who sells VDO guages sells these.  Sometimes they don't like to
tell you because they aren't all that much for the senders only. 
Overall, it's not a great design to begin with.

I have been trying to install a Autometer temp guage that I got from a
friend a couple of years ago.  It has a guage, multiple senders and a
8-position switch.  The switch allows you to switch to the individual
senders, checking up to eight different spots with only one guage!

I will report on that one when it's done.

&gt; I have a cylinder head temp guage and a sender on each side of the engine.
&gt; The senders seem not to be working. One worked for a while and has now
&gt; stopped too. These senders sit under the washers on my #2 amd #4 spark
&gt; plugs. They have two wires from each to the guage. Does anyone know where I
&gt; can get two new ones? Or maybe how these work so I can fix the two I have?
&gt; None of my catalogs sell them. As far as I've seen anyway. Thanks
