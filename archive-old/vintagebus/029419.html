Ronnie,

My bus was in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. I have that to tell the grandkids (if I
live so
long).

As far as their &quot;budget&quot;, it really doesn't interest me. . . what
interests me
is the cold hard cash I need to restore my bus. I am not about to &quot;lend&quot;
my
vehicle to a bunch of well paid fatcats. They can get someone else for
that or
pay my price. Personally, I think it foolish to do it for the kudos when
so much
money is involved (how much is a thirty second spot worth now??) Models
get paid
big bucks, the producers get paid big bucks, even the food stylists make
big
bucks. The auto providers should too.

Les
