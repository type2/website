Sorry it took so long to post them, but it's a PITA to updload more than a
few.  EB- you should think about multiple file uploads.

I would if I actually thought people could handle the responsibility.

People can't even post stuff in the right categories, they just post
everything in &quot;VW Shows&quot;.  :)

Specific suggestions for improvements always welcome.
