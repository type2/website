Thanks for the info - I have a lead on a nose skin from a '62. What was the

name of the tool you saw for doing the edges and where can it be found?????

I am sorry, I don't know.  I guy I know has one, I could try and find out.
Think it cost about $150, so it's not cheap.

Sounds like something I need. Someone else posted that the switch I

described sounded like the rear dome light switch...yes? If there is a hole

on the other side of the pod, opposite this switch, could this be where a

rearwindow defogger switch may have been mounted.

well, you have a rear dome light activating switch on the left side of your
dash pod- is it the same?   I don't know wher eyours is mounted or wher ethe
stock one is mounted or what it looks like.   I could find out.

More questions: Are cargo doors the same throughout the years - I need new

doors for my '66. Are cargo doors with popout windows the same as

non-popouts? Finally, what's the going rate for a decent door.
- - - - - - 
you want low hinge cargo doors- the hinge is just above the belt line- the
high hinge ones won't fit.  You also want the front cargo door to have the
recess where it will bump the front doors- from when the push button doors
started in dec 63.   

Cargo doors w/pop outs have the hinge for the pop out welded in place.   The
solid window doors don't.  They can, however, be removed or added.

places vary.  Could be free or ten bucks or fifty bucks or ?   Look around.
