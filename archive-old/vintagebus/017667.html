Subject: Bus rear and 67-only mid seat f/s
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi volks.
I'm selling a rear seat with original caramel brown
upholstery. The seams are separated at both sides and
once on the seat, but all material and piping are
there, only one major rip, and it's on the side
(against the panel)

The middle is full length with 1/3 fold down, really
just a frame (unupholstered), but it's a 67-only, with
the outer leg bent out. Frame and springs are
straight, it has all the shark's teeth for tacking the
upholstery down, Some surface rust.

Check this link for basic pics, 

http://www.geocities_dot_com/jelm2/seats.jpg

I have plenty more pics and details if interested.

Price is $450 for both, or $250 each.

I would love to sell these in So. Cal. but I'll ship,
for extra crating expense.

Thanks for your time, 

Jason
