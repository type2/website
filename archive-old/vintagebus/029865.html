Once you finish those webpages you might want to check with Type2_dot_com to
see if they'd like to include a link to them in the Type 2 technical
library.  Might go well with the other gas heater articles they have
there.

&gt;     I just finished a hot run on my Eberspacher BA-4 heater out in my front
&gt; yard.  I'm pleased to report that it worked PERFECTLY!!  I'm planning to
&gt; install this into my '66 E-Z Camper.  This little unit can really put out
&gt; some serious heat!!  I'm thoroughly impressed with it.
&gt; 
&gt;     The retro-fit of a BA-4 is NOT your typical heater to get installed in a
&gt; splitty, so I've been taking pictures with my digital camera.  I'm slowly
&gt; writing a series of webpages documenting it for those who may be interested
&gt; in how the install goes once it's finished.
