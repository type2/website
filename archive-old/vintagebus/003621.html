I know a guy from Israel who says that all vehicles are required by law to
have this huge white/red striped reflective tape goin the whole length of
their rear bumper on all vehicles. Must not be such a bad idea even though
it is ugly, of course they dont have many street lights over there.....but
they also dont have very many rear end accidents..

He claims they dont buy new cars, they just keep the old ones runnin.

&gt;So, what about getting the reflective tape from the
auto parts store and making a VW emblem on a white
card. That would be safe and also look pretty cool.
You could use the nose emblem as a template. That
would be plenty big.&lt;
