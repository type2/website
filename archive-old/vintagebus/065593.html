Subject: Re: [VB] want to undercoat my bus for winter

How about Waxoyl:

http://www.hammerite-automotive_dot_com/products/waxoyl.htm

It's like a mixture of mineral spirits, beeswax, and machine oil.  Very
popular with old British car fans, it appears.  Unfortunately it's not
quite as easily available as your local Home Depot.  You would need to
find a regional distributor.  (Like, there's a distributor in
Massachusetts where I got mine.)

&gt; I posted this question on the type2 list last week but didn't get any
&gt; answers.  Thanks in advance for your help.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if there's something I can get like at Home Depot to
&gt; undercoat my bus and just apply it with a big paint brush to prevent my bus
&gt; from rusting.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone done this?
