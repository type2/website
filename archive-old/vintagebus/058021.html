now now, no need to gripe about minor 
details.

i appreciate the advice and things to check. i did 
not mention originally that the engine is a fresh rebuild (new heads, new p/c, 
new crank etc), hence the only 75+ miles.

today i just drove the darn thing. runs super. 
can't find a vacuum leak so i'm not gonna think there is one for now. yes, this 
may be foolish, but i'm gonna run it for a few hundred miles and then check the 
plugs to see what they look like and go from there. they showed no signs of a 
lean condition so far, so i very much doubt there is a vacuum leak at all. once 
the thing runs for a few minutes or so, it idles on all 4. again, it runs super 
great, plenty of power, good pick-up, and i can do 60 and not have to press the 
accelerator very much.

thanks again to all, but keep any thoughts 
coming.

Steve- ( and all )-

We need to read these posts more carefully.

The compression test results were included in the original post.

( And they are higher than your reasonable estimate ! ).

I failed to note that myself.

  Check the compression in all 4 cylinders. If you have 110-120 psi in 
all

4,

  put clean plugs in and drive it for 15 - 20 minutes. Pull the plugs 
and

  check them. All should be light brown if the cylinder is firing 
right.
