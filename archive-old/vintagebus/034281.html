 I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have a rebuild kit for a 25hp 
 engine?  I'm also looking for useable wheel cylinder rebuild kits for a '52 
 bus.  Can anyone out there help?
  &gt;&gt;
the bottom end is the same as a 36hp (though be aware of you oil 
strainer/PICK UP TUBE style)

did you grab those NOS 25hp ps and cs?  they aren't all that common.

the rear wheel cylinders are the same as the front for an oval window bug, 
which you can buy new.  The front wheel cylinders take the same rebuild kits 
as a 69 bug front wheel cylinders, which you can buy new, and the parts 
people will be happier to get a reasonable part for you.  I think I paid 
$2.50 or so a rebuild kit to put on my 53,  a 52 has the same brakes.    yes- 
the hydraulic wcs on a 69 bug are the same size as the wcs on the old 
barndoor, except that year bug has dual circuit and Wider brake shoes.  Think 
68 bugs have the same width brake shoes as the BD.
