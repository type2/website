Subject: RE: [VB] Quality vent wing latches?

  The Brazilian latch delema never ceases to amaze me. I have had some in my
own bus for 5 years and never broke one. Have sold probably 1000 of them in
the last 5 years and have never really had a high return/broke ratio.
  Granted the Brazilian ones are cast base and the German ones forged or use
a much stronger alloy, but all you have to remember is to don't pull on the
latch hard to close. I just close the wing vent then squeeze the glass with
my hand and latch it. You MIGHT have to grind the nub down on the latch if
it is to tight.
  If you have all new seals you will more then likely break a German latch
also if you use to much force, that's why the OG ones broke in the first
place.
  I just went back to see which latches I have now and noticed that they are
a different manufacturer then I had previously. The last batch had a
guaranty 6 anos on the bags and the new ones only say guaranty but no year
anos now? hummmm
   You can also try and find a used wing vent from a bus with a good latch
and swap them out (latch that is)

Subject: [VB] Quality vent wing latches?


Apparently, not all vent wing latches are created
equal.  Last night, after disassembling and reassembling
the driver's side door of my '66 standard to replace
the vent wing latch that the thieves who tried to steal
my radio broke, the new shiny latch I bought for a few
bucks at the local VW shop promptly snapped off in my hand
the second time I latched it.

I see that Wolfsburg West sells a 5 dollar Brazilian version
of this latch and that they also sell some German latches for
$50.  I'm assuming that the Brazilian latch is what I got
locally and that they are all junk.  However, $50 seems like
a lot of money for this small part.

Can anyone direct me to a source of sturdy vent wing latches
that aren't over priced?

Thanks and Best Regards,
