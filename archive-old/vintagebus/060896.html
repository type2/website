Subject: RE: [VB] Hoover bit/oil cooler seal on DP 1600

The only problem I see with moving the fuel line to
that side (driver) is that now fuel is closer to the
battery and the main harnessnot to mention the
starter! I would hate to have a leak start over there!

&gt; &gt;   For bus travelers/non anal retentives, I have
&gt; found the best way to route
&gt; &gt; the fuel line in to drill another hole through the
&gt; drivers side bulkhead,
&gt; 
&gt; This looks good to me.  I've been planning on doing
&gt; that to my 67 as it
&gt; will now need an electic fuel pump anyway.  I might
&gt; like it enough to
&gt; convert the others.
