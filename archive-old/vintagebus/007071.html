I've seen the VW ads with the little pile of parts. That's the catalog,
right? They could'a spread the stuff out on the page to make it look
like more and put prices next to 'em. ;-)

Best thing to move large objects around is a SkyHook(tm). Do you want
the splitty model or the late bus version?

I'm glad the kids are lowering the busses. They're putting them in
circulation, will sell them cheap when they get tired of them and are
harder to tip over. More cheap busses in better shape.
