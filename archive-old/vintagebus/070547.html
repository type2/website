Subject: Re: [VB] Rear axle question / project update

I am trying to do the same thing on my bus while I am waiting to get enough
money to build my engine.

I have a question though. When I took out my trans, the bolts that held the
RGB's on did not have any lock washers or lock plates. I had a bus a long
time ago and it had lock plates that the bolts went through and the corners
of the lock plates bent up at the corners flush at one side of 3 of the RGB
bolts on each side. The bent corner locked the bolt in place so it would not
back out. Does anyone have these on their bus? I haven't been able to find
them in any of the usual places.

   I'm just gettings ready to install the rear end back in my bus.  I bought
a set of one piece axle boots, and would like some advice on installing them
prior to attempting it.  Any advice on this is greatly appreciated.
