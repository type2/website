Subject: FW: RMMW/I'm back-long


&gt; Well the trip started out as planned, got the bus all loaded and ready to
&gt; head out on Thursday morning, but waited for UPS and other shippers to
&gt; arrive to get orders out (got to keep everyone happy), finally about 1 PM
&gt; (planned departure was 5 am) I left (116 degrees and HUMID). The new 1800
&gt; in the bus had 60 miles on it so it was ready to go. Left Havasu and
&gt; slowly worked the engine to get the feel on the highway and without a Tach
&gt; had to play it by ear. Slowly worked my way up to a comfortable 70 MPH and
&gt; the bus purred like a kitten, 75 mph and still good so I went for it. Then
&gt; it happened about 2 1/2 hours in the trip I started to lose power, got off
&gt; on the next off ramp and heard a load clatter. not to be worried I filled
&gt; up on gas, pulled off to the side and checked my valves. It happened, a
&gt; rocker wavy spring broke causing the rocker arm to come off the valve
&gt; stem, not to fret I broke out another rocker shaft and made the repair
&gt; (the rocker shaft assemblies were the only used part on the engine). This
&gt; repaired I continued my journey to NM and JP's house arriving there around
&gt; 11 pm (10 az time) so I made the 536 mile journey in 9 hours including a 1
&gt; hour down time for repair and 3 more gas/bathroom stops.
&gt;    5.30 the next morning JP rousted everyone up and we were all ready to
&gt; head out, went to JP's shop to change my oil and I had used approx 1 cup
&gt; so far. All said and done the Caravan left. Jim Burnite and 2 friends in
&gt; there buses from Yuma, Me, JP, Kerry in the high roof,  Berry, John Kyte
&gt; and JP.  We all headed out and had an uneventful trip till Taos County NM,
&gt; where I started fouling plugs, a few more stops for repairs and I told all
&gt; to continue so they wouldn't have to wait for me again. This time I
&gt; rejetted the carbs and solved the problem (3 sets of plugs latter). We
&gt; finally made it to OE VW in Lake George to check out his stuff (lot's of
&gt; nice German and OE VW parts and decided to blow off the camp-ground and go
&gt; to RMMW to camp-out and to our surprise was awesome, there were 74 buses
&gt; (Colo Bus Club count) camped out there, it was a mini show in itself all
&gt; camped out in the woods next to RMMW, this is what Bus shows and camp-outs
&gt; are all about. I wished all the other Buskatiers would have stayed there,
&gt; but Rob and Pig Pen were there representing the rest of the group and
&gt; fielding all of the WHERE ARE THEY questions. 
&gt;    The rest of the weekend was no different then anybody else might have
&gt; posted or will so I won't go into that and the drive home was uneventful.
&gt; I stayed with John Jones (aka the guy with the hacked, lowered DD, BD, air
&gt; bagged bus, you should see it now) oh ya, you will in Hot VW's, on Sunday
&gt; night in Grand Junction, Colo. Got up Monday morning and hit the road
&gt; around 6;30 am and made it back to Havasu by 4:30 pm, which included a 75
&gt; mile detour due to the road washing out. So I did 700 or so miles in a
&gt; little over 10 hours including gas stops which put my average speed at
&gt; 70-75 mph, the bus does work good and that was fully loaded, roof rack and
&gt; all with a bag of NM chilies there also. Gas mileage worked out to 18
&gt; which really pleased me, much better then the 13 with the 1776 I had in it
&gt; before.
&gt; 
&gt; ronnie,  2000 miles and am back
&gt; 
&gt; ps. When I arrived back to town I got a call from the wife to stop by the
&gt; shop. It turned out that we had a large rain on Sunday night and my whole
&gt; office and half of my showroom were flooded, wipped out a lot of stuff
&gt; (parts rain damaged sale soon), but I did get the computers back up.
