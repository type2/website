Well, the patch I tried with the dime seems to be holding, for now.  I think
I'm in luck, after my trial run around town, I came home and went back to
check the condition of the &quot;repair&quot; and , what did I find?  Laying on the
driveway, 3 days later, was the original plug.  Tomorrow I'll remove my
temporary fix and re-install the original with a bit of JB.

    Thanks again for all the hints on fixing it.

&gt; This repair is covered in the archives, I believe.
&gt;
&gt; I've had good results using sheet lead to make the plug.  By holding the
&gt; sheet lead against the opening and rotating it slightly under pressure
&gt; you'll mark the lead with a ring of the correct diameter.  Then cut out
the
&gt; plug using tin snips or sturdy scissors.
&gt;
&gt; If you have a pin punch slightly smaller in diameter than the plug recess
&gt; you can get a pretty good seal by tapping lightly on the lead plug's
&gt; periphery after it's inserted.  Be sure the pressure is applied only to
the
&gt; outer edge of the plug that's backed up by the small inner ledge in the
&gt; recess.  And as George suggests, top it off with some epoxy sealant.
&gt;
&gt; I've never had a plug repaired this way fail again, even after years of
use.
&gt;
&gt; Some carbs have an original plug that's a cast part, with an inner shape
&gt; that matches the inside of the carb's barrel.  Replacing these with a
simple
&gt; flat plug doesn't seem to noticeably affect the carb's performance.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW.....
