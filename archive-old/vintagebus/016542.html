i just got a 1600 dual port for clyde and i was wonder
your opinions on these motors. does anyone have one of
these? it's brand new, not rebuilt. it has unleaded
heads, and it was made at the mexico plant. i will
have it set up with dual weber 34's, bosch 009,
lightened flywheel, and empi gt-style muffler. how
much hp do you suppose this will put out? i'm assuming
it will be significantly greater than my old 1300 with
bad compression and a wobbly crankshaft pulley...
