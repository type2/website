Subject: Re:  [VB] 2part PRtubes/No bids on this - why?

I think the two part push rod tubes are very useful in case of emergencys.   
I carry one in my spare parts box along with a spare push rod.   Actually 
just the other day a friend of mine broke one push rod and bent another - 
both on #1 in his 1776 with dual carbs.      but the valves were not stuck.  
he put it together with a couple replacement push rods and a couple two part 
tubes, and the thing runs.  What I dont get is why  the push rods did that- 
could the valves have unstuck?   He also had had the fresh air hoses capped 
off, which seems to me makes the heads run hotter   (I got him the reconnect 
them).  ANy ideas on what goes on?

I haven't gotten any hits on my set of double nut push rod tubes.  I think I

should have used the word &quot;engine&quot; or &quot;motor&quot; in the descrip.  Anyway, the

current bid is 1 cent for the set so check 'em out and see if they are worth

anything more than that to you!
