Just got back from Kelly Park.  The best thing about the show?  Lots of
cars.  The worst thing about the show?  Lots of cars.  It was over-capacity
- they closed the gates and weren't letting any more people in, so I wasn't
able to show the '55 and '60 (and tom mink his ghia)  This also
monkeywrenched the 10:00am meeting at the VintageBus_dot_com panel :( although
we informally did it in the parking lot.  I did some social engineering and
managed to get the panel in, but the westy stayed outside :(
I was honored to park with the AZ contingent, rounding out the DD panel
corral.

Met more listees in a single day than ever - CCC events included!  Met John
Howard, Ronnie, Richard, *Everett*, saw Harry, Craig, Matt, Steve, Clara,
Steve M, and a buncha others I can't even recall right now.

The buses ran well, and Jeff appeared to enjoy driving the '55, despite the
indadequate heating...  My only complaint with the panel was sub-optimal
gas mileage.  We stopped on the way back for a panel dead on the side of
the road.  It looked like he blew his coil, and none of us had a 12v spare.
 It was kinda cool seeing the 3 buses and ghia that stopped for him all
lined up...

Now the rant: Kelly Park is a great place for a show, but they need to
start being judicious about what they let in.  Anything with an A chassis
needs to stay outside.  There were about a half dozen new beaters all in a
row.  Is that necessary?   That was 6 bugs or buses or ghia that coulda
been let in.  I thought this was supposed to be a &quot;vintage&quot; meet?  Corrados
with boomin' stereos aren't vintage in my book...

And once people *are* in, organize the parking somehow!  If it was a little
less helter-skelter, you could get more cars in.

Not a lot happenin' in the swap.  Lots of stuff, but...  One guy had an NOS
tilt and bows for a DC for $1800.  My big score was an under-dash record
player.
