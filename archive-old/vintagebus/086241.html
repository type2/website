Subject: My Daughter Wants to Go to Bonnaroo

So my eldest is 17 now. And evidently I am 17 years older than the day she was born which still makes me incredulous, but that is another message.

My sweet girl has declared her intention to go to Bonnaroo with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend  is 18. If she is going to go to Bonnaroo with a boy, then I guess he will do. There are worse boys. She has always been very provincial but now lately she wants to have Adventures. (Room to make the big mistakes, as those lovely girls on the record put it.) The day had to come. I am sad and broody about it but the day did have to come.

Anyway. If there are any kind souls on these lists who plan to go to Bonnaroo, and who might let these teenagers caravan with you and maybe you could let them park near you, and maybe glance their way every once in a while and see that no harm comes to them beyond what is self-inflicted, I would be grateful. I'm sure they would think it very cool to camp with some Volks for a while.

Off-list messages would be great. They would be headed to Manchester from the west. Thanks,

Ken Hooper
