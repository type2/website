 1) Is there a trick or shut off valve to use so that gas doesn't go 
everywhere while replacing fuel lines?
 
yes, they came on the pre 62 buses instead of gas guages.  pencil stuck in 
fuel line also helps.  Or you can drain the gas into a can.

 2) what is the right best fuel line setup? Metal rubber or braided? I 
searced for post but haven' found out what is best.
 3) Do I need to remove the engine to replace all the fuel lines?
 ............................
I used German braided.   
engine out is easiest, but can be done w/ engine in.  
I start from the carb end.  (after plugging or vise gripping the old line.  
You need a grommet where the lin goes through the engine tin.  Use the stock 
clips on the roof forward to the engine to keep the fuel line from  dropping 
on the heater boxes or axles.   Give your self enough extra line so you'd be 
able to pull the engine back and clear the tranny spline, then reach forward 
over the dropped motor to undo the fuel line.
 .................................
 4) Last but not least, what is the most typical mechanism of engine fires. 
The gas starts leaking on to engine and ?? ( also electrical short ?? ) .  
Does the gas ever start leaking and just douse the engine without starting a 
fire?
 
 Thank you thank you thank you I really want to fix this right, fortuneately 
I did have a fire extinquisher on me but opening the engine hatch with a 
church key requires a
..................
sound like you had line in the engine compartment ooze, probably drip near 
the coil .   I like to give more line toi the fuel filter and hook the line 
around the coil or zip tie it to the engine roof to keep it away from the 
coil wires in case of leaks.

hows the wiring?
