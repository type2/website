Subject: VW Trends Bus Issue
Date: Sun, 5 Mar 2000 12:44:10 -0800

While I generally don't like VW Trends much (prefer HotVWs), I just picked
up the March 2000 issue because it is devoted to the 50th anniversary of the
bus. Haven't really read it yet, but from flipping through, it appears to be
entirely about VW busses and worth the $3.50 cover price.
