Subject: Offroad to Jerome Jam

  Have had quite afew inquire about the trip since Ronnie posted on list.
Here is a rough idea of what we are going to do.
  Leave LHC early Thursday morning ( anyone coming in Wed can stay at my
house or Ronnies Wed night) and drive  about 5 miles south .and take to the
desert at Standard Wash (mile marker 173 hwy 95). From there we will travel
on dirt roads about 70 miles to Wikieup (on hwy 93), head north on 93 to
I-40. East on I-40 to exit 109( about 15 miles west of Seligman) then 10
miles of dirt roads to my 5 acre lot where we will spend the night. Total
driving miles from LHC to the lot is about 130 miles.
  Friday morning we go into Seligman for breakfast and gas. Will then take
old rt. 66 to AshFork and head south on Hwy 89 to Paulden (about 20 miles
so. of Ash Fork) where we will turn east and take dirt roads into Jerome. We
will come out of the mountains right at the Gold King Mine. The dirt road is
about 34 miles from Paulden to Gold King Mine. Anyone who wants to meet us
along the way get ahold of me.
  We can meet up with people in Seligman or Ash Fork or at the train
overpass by Paulden.
  So far we only have 4 confirmed that are going. Bring extra gas,a good
spare tire, cb radio. I will have a generator and air compressor and flat
repair kits.
  Will be a trip to remember.
