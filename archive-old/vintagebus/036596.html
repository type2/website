 That bus already went overseas, whats the big deal
 happening again???
 -------------------------------
 Um, excuse me! *that bus* came over seas from it's
 European home to Arizona USA and is still for sale at
 that location in extremely nice shape. What it is- is
 a bitchen bus. Everyone has an opinion about it but
 few opinion holders have actually seen it, driven it,
 worked on it, or camped in it. I really wish that I
 could afford to hang on to it. Serious negotiations
 for serious potential buyers.
 I have no qualms about sending it further West, Far
 East or anywhere else. All potential buyers treated
 equally with respect, honor and dignity.

I drove this bus to the Phoenix Bug a Rama about a month ago from Jim's house 
in Phoenix.   So Jim could drive the 67 westy, as he and Paula's baby was 
only 12 weeks old and she didn't want to drive plus pulling the Puck while 
tending the tot, don't blame her a bit.  Anyway, the point is that it really 
drives very nice.  The only drawback is that since the spare tire is mounted 
on the back hatch, putting extra weight there, it did come open while driving 
and lose its hubcap.   This happened on a surface street, and the guy behind 
honked seeing the back hatch down, so I pulled over to shut it.  The back 
hatch of an ambulance folds down, not up, and the safety latch to hold it in 
case of this event was undone, oops, secured it and all was fine.     But it 
really was a joy to drive, full of Fahvergnu:gen, a peppy 36hp with that 
lovely 36hp fweeeeK  which is higher pitched than the 1600 fweem.  Shifts 
nice, stops good, steers well, feels solid.   Even comfy to camp in.
