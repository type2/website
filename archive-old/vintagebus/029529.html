Subject: More H30/31

Anyone out there have a mixture adjusting screw (the pointed end one)
for the Brazilian H30/31?  I figured I could just go down to my local
VWFLAPS and pick one up.  Nope.  No one I could find around me (Orange
county) said they had one.

So does anyone out there have a junk H30/31 that they could pull the
mixture screw out of?  I've tried screws from german 30's and 34's and
neither will fit.

Thanks a bunch!!

Steve
