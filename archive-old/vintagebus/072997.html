Subject: Re: [VB] AIRS, cell phones and help on the road

Jim,

That was probably Tim Johnson.  Yeah, his cell is
pretty hard to hear sometimes.

You'll be glad to hear he made a connection with a
Jason(?) who had room for him to work, and he's back
on the road with his deluxe, trailer, and various
kayaks and bikes.  He can't make RMMW or Jerome, but
he will be at Busses and Balloons in Albuquerque in
early October.  (P-mail me for details.)

JP
