Folks,

Allow me to correct a point in my posting:

The electronic fuel pump *used* to be mounted on the vertical strut, it is
now mounted as I finally said, on the engine room floor in the left corner
cavity (the non-battery area).

&gt; The filter and pump are mounted on the left side engine room floor, in the 
&gt; right side non-battery area ,out of the way, and minimizes the possibility
&gt; of pumping fuel onto the hot engine (engine fire). All the lines are
&gt; visible and easily serviced and checked.
