Hey---
When I was talking to the PO of my bus on the phone, he kept referring to it 
as a barndoor even though it was a '59. It seems someone he met in the 
Grateful Dead parking lot in the mid eighty's thought he was a bus genious 
and told him that!
He also told the PO that the fiberglass air scoops were the only way to go, 
so he ordered a set! Luckily, the PO wasn't too smart and he bought bay 
window air scoops:)  geezzz! And he graciously through them in the bus and 
gave them to me for free---
BTW---Anyone who wants bay window air scoops can email me and get them for 
the cost of shipping ----I'm not promoting the use of these but who knows 
(otherwise they're gonna go out to the corner for the garbage man!!!:)

--Pete
