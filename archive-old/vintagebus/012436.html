Subject: Greasing Electric Terminals
Message-Id: &lt;199903130601.BAA11980_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

 I want to comment on this greasing your grounds thread . .

 Vaseline . . tho a light grease is still non-conductive . .
which is the same as &quot;di-electric&quot; . . . insulating . .

 If you grease terminals before you bolt down, the only reason you
get any juice is because the two surfaces have hi points that mash
into each other where grease can't survive . . 

 The opposite of di-electric is &quot;conductive&quot; . . ?  :-)

 An interesting fact is that electricity and heat have the same rate
of conductance . . Kirchoff or one of those guys . .

 They make a silver paste for &quot;conductive grease&quot; . . 

 Then there's the &quot;poor boy&quot;,  they have a copper anti-sieze grease.
or the aluminum stuff . . each having it's own  rate of heat
conductance and a similar rate of electical conductance . .

 If you must grease between the terminal and frame, etc, then use
one of the above . . it's better than just grease . .

 We do all know that electricity really travels from negative to
positive . ?   yet still we pamper the positive wires and neglect
the real power cables . . the ground . .

 Best is to clamp down or slide on and then grease over . .

 Better best is they now have &quot;liquid electric tape&quot; same like the
goop you dip tool handles in . .
 Clamp it down then coat with the &quot;l.e.t.&quot; . . hermetically sealed.

 Would I lie to you guys . . ?   :-)
