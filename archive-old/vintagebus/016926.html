Chet:
Sorry to hear about the troubles.  That's a bummer for sure.  3 engines in 2 
months is a b*tch.  What about rebuilding your AE case? That's not exactly a 
holiday project but you might want to think about getting on it soon.  (Yeah 
I should do my H case).  Too bad you left, I'd loan you the Tinkertoy engine 
until you got back up.  ANY LISTEES ABLE TO HELP CHET?

&quot;after 2 turns I started to wonder and sure enough the stud was coming out 
of the case.  Any ideas what to do?  This is my only way to work, and I'll 
gladly buy a stock engine if I need to to buy some time to get this one 
fixed.  Anyone in WA got one for sale?  A long block would even do just 
fine.  I doubt I could find a business open on the fourth to supply a part 
that day.&quot;
