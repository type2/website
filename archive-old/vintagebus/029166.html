Subject: Vintage Nazis footnote

I just wanted to make sure that everyone here knows that I'm not down on
the vintage nazis at all. I'm not sure where the term &quot;vintage nazi&quot;
came from, but I always got a kick out of it... Sometimes I hear of
someone comparing the pebble grain on a piece of aftermarket plastic to
the original german part. That is attention to detail... They own
beautiful buses that get plenty of attention at shows, but I wouldn't
want to carry my slobbering 150 lb. dog around in one of these.

There are a few gurus out there with a yard full of buses, some slated
for full restoration, some are candidates for a brake job and a used
engine, sold cheaply to the hippy kids. If it has been cut, chopped,
dropped or wrecked, they decide whether it is worth it to bring it back
to showroom quality. Not every bus is worth this kind of money. These
buses still deserve to be on the road. In the hands of a resourceful
mechanic, they just might last forever in their bastardized state...

There was a red splitty at Buses on the Blue Ridge a few years ago that
had been shortened, dropped, chopped and tinted. Someone obviously spent
a lot of time and money on this bus. Even the Vintage Nazis remarked on
how well this job was done. Two barndoors at the Bulli Brigade a couple
of years ago were basically Empi resto-customs... It would have been
nice if they had been restored to their original state, but at least
they weren't crushed or rusting away under a shroud of kudzu. It is much
cheaper to fix a bus with aftermarket parts than with OEM parts.

The term &quot;Vintage Nazi&quot; is a friendly poke at the perfectionists
studying the pebble grain on plastic parts, but maybe it is more
appropriate for certain people who are unfriendly towards the rest of us
folks who just wanna keep our buses on the road, however ugly they may
be...
