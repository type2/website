Subject: Re: [VB] Trip report on Bakersfield

I was there too, without a VW. There were a lot of Fresno VW people there, including the legendary Dennis Sullivan who had a short stack of NOS mirrors that sold fast. Karl won the stock post '67 plaque, a bunch of raffle goodies including the grand prize, an electric scooter. He rode it the half mile to my place Sunday evening. First time I've seen him driving a non-German vehicle. 

Charley did crank up the ladder. My brother the fireman inspected it closely. You might have noticed his VW bus cycling jersey. 
There was a nice VW fire truck with pump and all the gear parked on a side alley but not opened. Anybody know about it? 

That M-code for the doglegless bus was for the left side only. Maybe it's the Hot New Oildale Look?

Well run by VTO and German Dreams!
