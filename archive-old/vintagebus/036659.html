Hi Thom,

&gt; I guess you haven't seen the repro harnesses that are 
&gt; available - the colors
&gt; are very close to original.  Not perfect, but close enough for this
&gt; Vintage Nazi - Heil!

Nope, down here in the third world things like new wiring harnesses for
vintage vw buses are pretty rare :-) 

I could probably track down and buy an entire roll of each colour and gauge
of wire cheaper than I could convert the peacock feathers that we trade with
down here to US$ and import a completed one.
