 The top speed of a T2 is what ever you get with WOT.
 
 The air intake is a restriction and limits the amount of air
 available for combustion and thus the power the engine can
 put out.
 
 VWs are made to run at WOT all day.
 
 If you are overheating on a good engine, try uping your fuel
 octain.
