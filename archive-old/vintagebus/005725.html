&gt;new old stock or new old sh%t, some items that are still in there original
boxes are defects that were never returned or hooked up wrong and set back
on the self or who knows.My point is electrical items you just don;t know
unless you test them first, which was my mistake!
&gt;
Reminds me of a guy I met a few months ago in SoCal, he had one side of a
storage shed full of NOS parts boxes that he bought at a repossessed VW shop
bank auction.  Only problem was, he got them home and it turned out the guys
had been putting all the used parts back in the NOS boxes!

Doh!

See ya,
