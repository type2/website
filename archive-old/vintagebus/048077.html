Hi all,

        Due to a unexpected move I must sell my buses QUICKLY! So here 
goes...1966 Standard Micro complete, was being disassembled for 
resto...$150.00, 1966 Double Cab, 12 volt, rusty but all there and could be a 
good driver...$200.00, 1960 Double Door Panel, no motor, body better than it 
looks(has lots of surface rust)...$100.00  These will be sold by the 16th of 
this month or they are off to the scrapyard, I would MUCH prefer they go 
loving VW oriented homes, so fair OFFERS will be accepted and ridiculous 
offers considered! I also have a dozen other aircooleds to sell that are 
non-VB drop me an email if you are curious. Please do not call unless you are 
willing and able to buy and move these buses by the 16th.
Thank you,

Dan
