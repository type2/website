 It is installed on the underside top of the engine lid next to the
 license light.  I thought that was an odd place until I pulled the
 simple light apart (basically a bulb holder with no cover).  Inside the
 light to my surprise was a mercury switch.  Its a small glass container
 about 1/2 &quot; long with contacts at each end.  A small amount of mercury
 sloshes around inside.  When you lift the lid, the mercury makes contact
 and the bulb lights.  Put the lid down and the mercury goes to one end
 and the light goes out.  Very cool.  All self contained. Works like a
 charm.
 
 Are these types of switches still available?  Could this have been
 dealer installed or was it an after market &quot;Pep Boys&quot; thing??  This is
 on my 62 DC
  &gt;&gt;

A friend of mine installed a light in his engine compartment that uses one of 
those things from later bug /bus doors for the overhead light to go one with 
the door closed- different system, same concept.  I use the splitty interior 
lights in my engine compartment, guess I could leave it on and drain 
thebattery, but I haven't yet.
