Well all this talk about Bobs sermons has me thinking they must be pretty
cool to read...I would like to read them but wondering where too? Site?
And don't worry I wont copy them...

Also I saw people were mad because P.I.P.  is that the name? aren't
making racks anymore for the buses. I got a mail order catalog yesterday
for Rocky Mountain Motorworks and they had some decent racks in there for
the Vintage buses and beetles....you can call 1800 258 1996 for a free
catalog...

Greg
