Mark wrote&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually the kit is from a 1959 and earlier kit! If it was
from 1960 it
would of had red and black plaid instead of the yellow and black plaid
that it is.How do I know you ask?That was my old kit!!
&lt;&lt;&lt;

Ummm, that is interesting. I have seen SO-23 kits up to late 1961 that
utilized the yellow/black plaid combo. Even some of the literature I have on
the &quot;Mosaic&quot; options in the early 60's show the yellow/black plaid. Maybe
Mr. Swangstu knows for sure. I knew that it was your old kit......and the
reason that a cabinet is missing is because it flew out of your truck on the
way to Thom and it was crushed by oncoming traffic &lt;ouch!&gt; :) Regardless,
there are some noticeable differences between a 55' and a 59-60' kit.

To all that wrote me concerning the kit, thanks for the overwhelming
response...I will keep you posted. Just a note the kit for sale is steeply
priced. I talked to him today and he said that he wants at least $2500 for
it. I am working on getting pictures available.
