&lt;&lt; I think I may pull out my transaxle as well while I'm under there? That 
way I can replace the boot, or what ever the thing is that is slowly dripping 
transmission fluid?  It is the fragmented rubber deal the goes where the 
shifter meets the transmission. Is there anything too difficult that I should 
expect?&gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
If you are going to POR-15 it then you need to get above the tranny to do the 
job right and derust everything as much as possible to make the coating work 
properly.  The tranny nose come always drip, but if real bad then you are 
going to have to remove it and have a shop install a new bushing.  The rubber 
piece you speak of helps keep out the road dust from wearing out the bushing. 
 Also while the tranny is out you can remove the shift linkage, replacing all 
of the bushings and dust seals.  Which will make for a much tighter/accurate 
shifting VW.
 
&lt;&lt;My transmission side covers are also slowly dripping oil I'd like to fix 
that but I don't really want to take my reduction boxes apart - I was 
thinking about just retorquing them but ...... I'd really like to stop the 
dripping.  What is involved here?&gt;&gt;
As the old British saying goes &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound.&quot;.  Best to 
just take the RGBs and axles apart to do the job right and while you are in 
there you can inspect the axles for wear and the RGB bearings for any pits on 
the inner or outer races or roller/ball bearings.  Doing all this now will 
probably mean not having to do this repair on the road all too soon.  Plus 
doing all of this is a lot easier to do at home and when you do have a 
problem with the RGBs many, many miles later on a long trip you will not be a 
virgin at this work.  We have had to replace RGB bearings twice on the road 
so far.  The second time because we carry the bearings for one complete RGB 
in our spare parts on board we were able to complete the job in two hours at 
a rest stop with the 1955-63 suspension.  Eric&amp;Barb
