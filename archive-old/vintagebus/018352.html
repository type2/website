Ok, it's one thing to have a discussion, a little flamage, whatnot, -especially
on Friday - but quite another to just step out into the ring and wave a red cape.  
In the distand land of UseNET we call this a &quot;troll&quot;

If you want to try and defend yourself to the list - fine, do it.  But it's
kinda childish to just ring the doorbell, yell &quot;nyah-nyah-nyah&quot; then run away.

I too am confused about the what's what and what's going where, but I only have
a detached interest in the matter.  I'd tried to help you offline to figure out
a valuation for the seat, and that information and a $3.50 will get you a large
mocha _at_ starbucks.

It seems to me like you're feeling like a Player in the bus arena.  You wrapped
your mitts around a rare bus piece and are having a field day.  Great.  But
you've also made an *ass* of yourself in front of hundreds of people, which will
probably come back to bite you on the ass some day in the future.  How?  Some
day you'll need some hard to fine piece for *your* bus, or advice on how to 
deal with a problem.  VW people have long memories.  The non-businesslike qualities 
you've exhibited here will temper other's future dealings with you - if they will 
deal with you at all.  You're not ready for the big time; you don't have the 
business acumen - much less the inventory - to be calling any shots.  Some of the
SoCal big time parts hoarders may charge an arm and a leg for their stuff, but I
still respect the fact that (most) of them are very professional and straightforward
in their dealings.  The seller of the other DD seat may want $1000, but I know that 
if I show up with the green in my hand, I'd be going home with the seat.  I can
think of fewer things piss me off more than getting yanked around on a part that one
needs for a restoration.

Most listees were able to forgive earlier transgressions, writing it off as
the flailings of someone wet behind the ears.  I'm sure that innocent image has
long evaporated.
