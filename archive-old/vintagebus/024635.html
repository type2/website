All,
	My '66 right hand drive Westy has a C channel revitted along 3/4  the
length of the roof on the left side, the side door side on this bus. 
This C channel hooks up to a Swedish made self standing side tent.  I
don't think that Jim Ellis' friend &quot;Bonger&quot; installed this C channel. 
The '66 was bought new in Germany, shipped and driven across North
America and then sent on to New Zealand where I bought it from the
original owners 5 years ago.  I never asked them when the C channel/tent
arrangement was added.  I assumed that it was put together when the
Westy was new in Europe but maybe it was the work of Bonger's Kiwi
cousin!      Gary Gibson
