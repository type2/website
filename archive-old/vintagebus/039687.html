&gt;&gt;Your serial number following the &quot;B&quot; should have six digits starting with 
&gt;&gt;a 5.
&gt;
When there are no numbers I assume a rebuild happened along the way. Is that 
a fair assumption? Simularly, I have seen engines with a rivet holding a tag 
with engine numbers, these are more clearly a rebuild. I also have seen 
engines with the all the coding below the gen stand reading XXXXXXXXX.
