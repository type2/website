Subject: Re: [VB] Mystery parts/tools ???? (pic)

&gt;From: &quot;LilBlauWagen&quot; &lt;wades_wagens_at_qwest_dot_net&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A user on my site recently found these &quot;tools&quot; when removing his bed from 
&gt;his truck, hidden down
&gt;underneath for years. Can anyone guess what they are, what they were for, 
&gt;or if they are even
&gt;related to VW?

Cow tools.
