Subject: RE: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

  In my 60 DD panel, I cruise at 75/80 mph. It was built? by me to go that
speed. I find though that at 80mph plus the front end wants to float, so I
keep it at 75 and that's fully loaded. I have a 3.88 r/p and a 77 4th gear.
At 75 mph I'm turning 3500 rpm. I have put 10,000 plus miles on it so far
with the only problem when the engine was first built. I have a 1800 cc  74
stroke by 88mm cut in p/l. Duel port big valve heads and a mild custom grind
cam. I use duel Kadrons and an SS header with a turbo muffler. I average 18
mpg and have gotten up to 22 mpg. Hills don't slow me down. I have a full
length rack with tables and canopy and the back is always full of swap bins.
I have 185X14 8 ply tires and will go back up to 195X14 now that everything
is broken in. The trans has 35,000 plus miles and the German side bearings
are getting a little loose and the Chinese ones (the other side) are still
tight, go figure.
  The stock brakes worked fine but they have over 45,000 miles on them and
are showing signs of hardness. When I packed the bearings (front) before the
summer show season the front brakes were hard glazed and should have been
changed. The bus is due for a MAJOR service and will be done after BBB VI.
  Now my 60 15 window Deluxe with the OG trans will top out at 55 mph and
this was with an OG 40 hp or the 1776 single port that is in it now.
Different engines same speeds, just get to speed faster now. It's also
getting a FF when I get time as will my 60 DC and my 60 Westy, but I will be
quite content at 65 mph in those as the DD was built to get me to long
distant shows quicker.

ps. I have had the DD up to at least 95 or more and had to change the seat
covers.

&gt; Just how
&gt; fast does your bus go??

I accidently hit 83.3 mph (according to my new GPS) on
the way to LA for Thanksgiving in my '61 Flipseat
Westy.  That was (for those who know me) without
anything on my top racks except a little firewood to
keep the front one from whistling, but I was hauling
my singlewheel trailer (empty).

It's got a 3.88 big nut w/ a balanced 1776, dual baby
Webers, 205 15s, and I probably am winding it way out.
Gotta put a tach on it someday.  That's why I want to
carry my spare engine going to LA after BBB.  Never
can tell...
