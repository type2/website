Subject: rattle on boring Friday

   Today (and the last 3 days) we have been cleaning up my warehouse
(storage building) next to my shop. It has been such a dissater for the last
6 years i couldn't find a thing. Well Holy Bus parts busman. I was ammazed
at all the s#_at_t I have collected. It was nice because I got rid of a 55
Speedster to make more room and found all kinds of cool stuff and now have
places for it. Hopefully I will have it all orginized by BBB VI for the
usual mandatory shop tours. I hope to turn it into the BUS resto shop 

ronnie

liquidation sale on all type 1 parts. I have racks full of fenders hoods
bumpers and assorted type 1 stuff.
NO pre 67 type1 parts except for 10-20, 65 and later doors. I also have a
ton of bay stuff to get rid of.
