&gt; It's hit or miss.  One time I ordered bumpers, I got the big ones,
&gt; the next time I got the small ones.  The small ones are JUNK! -
&gt; in case you missed it... JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK!
&gt;

I totally agree with Thom. The small ones that I got a few years back ended
up crapping out after a few months. They suck. I called up BFY and ordered a
set of the &quot;big ones&quot; and they are very nice and have served my bus well.

The main difference I noticed is that most of the small ones acually have a
plastic threaded dealio instead of the normal metal bolt that goes into the
rubber.

Plastic Threads Bad! Metal Bolts Good!
