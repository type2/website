Subject: Re:  panels

&gt; does anyone know what kind of material you can use for door panels and
where
&gt; can you buy it. thanks, bob
&gt;
Get a 4' by 8' sheet of Masonite (also called hardboard)from your local
lumber yard. I haven't priced it lately, but a couple of years ago it was
around $6 for a 1/8&quot; thick panel.

If you want to get fancy, try tile-board or melamine. Both come in various
patterns and colors for any where from $10-$30 a 4' by 8' sheet.

Just trace and cut with a portable jig-saw. Cut the board with the good side
down, so you get a clean edge. Unless you're gonna upholster them, then it
doesn't matter.

Good luck!
