We had a similar thing happen.  We were on the road early one morning and stopped
at a gas station after about half an hour of freeway driving.  We looked under the
bus and oil was pouring out of the engine from an area between the engine and the
tranny, underneath the oil cooler area.  We lost about a half quart so no funny
noises.

 After a lot of looking and research we found that our oil cooler seals would open
up temporarily due to high oil pressure and let oil out then reseal when the
pressure dropped.   We were running 40 wt oil and found out later our dual case
pressure relief valve springs were probably for a high pressure system???  It only
happened with cold engine after that freeway incident.  We kept the RPMs down and
watched the oil pressure until we could do the repairs.  We replaced  the oil
seals between the stand and the cooler and eliminated the spacer washers on our
type 4 cooler. (on a stock SP 1600)
