RE:	'65 21 Window FS 8K (Josh please forward to the list)



Some of you may remember my message, almost two years ago, which entailed my
paint job saga of the Salmon/Coral/light peach and cream colored bus.  Well she
is still not being driven!  Only once a week around the neighborhood to keep her
alive, and then back in the garage.  This FUN-bus needs to be driven more.  She
really is an eye catcher from the outside, but the inside needs some attention. 
I've treated it like a baby, and I will be sad to see it go.

This bus was one of three rags I owned to be the daily driver beater category,
the other two were the bone stock and custom categories.  I believe this makes
me KING of the dreamers!  (Well I sold the bus intended for the custom category
($5K) I tried to sell it  on the list too.  some of you may remember the shell I
 was trying to sell w/o title and spliced in roof, well its gone.  The damn
thing was absolutely perfect.  BTW the title issue was a non-issue.   The bone
stock category bus I still have - '61 -23 walk-through - which BTW I'll never
sell FLW)  
Oh well back to the current bus for sale, here are some brutally honest details:

Body/paint work performed:
Both fender well reinstalled
New front skin installed (one head light bucket was pushed-in no frame damage)
Mediocre rust repair under drivers and passengers feet, rockers, and cargo floor
(Rust condition is good not fair and not excellent)
New acrylic enamel paint job
Pop-out windows powder coated


Good points:
Safari windows (Bus Boys eek!!)
Full-length middle  seat
Decent paint Job
Mechanically sound
Electronically sound
approximately 35 k on Gex long-block
Off set oil cooler (I think its called a doghouse, where air is directed through
the oil cooler and then out the engine tin by the transmission)
Alternator
All new rubber (incl. repro. front floor mat)
New canvas top

Not so good points:
Missing rear-most seat
Missing rear bumper o'er riders 
Missing rear bumper deluxe trim
Missing interior panels
Needs to be re-upholstered
Small oil leak at the base of a push-rod tube
Fuel tank sender ka-put
No headliner

The selling price is $8K, which is negotiable.  I would consider partial trades
(Pref. K.gia convert or double cab).  Sorry I don't have e-mailable pictures. 
This bus is located approximately 18 miles south of Portland Oregon (Sherwood to
be exact).   So come and see it!!!  I'm trying the list first before it hits the
newspaper.  If your interested please don't respond to Josh R.  respond to
George De La Rosa at GeorgeDLR_at_bioregon_dot_com or leave a message on my voice-mail
(800) 635-6399 ext. 14357.  My description doesn't serve it justice.
Thanks,
George
