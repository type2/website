I can relate to Dan's point in a way, i have had several people wanting cargo 
floor sections used that is, to be perfectly honest for the time cost of 
pulling the damn things you can buy floor halfs, so not to be rude but i'm 
not gonna pull'em,it might be good metal but geez the labor of pulling one 
out to salvage it would outweigh the income. I belive in trying to help but i 
have my limits,ask Neil Pickett about the work he went through to save his, 
then decieded to trash it after drilling out a zillion spot welds. In a 
nutshell its more trouble than its worth. But as i say that's my .02, 
hopefully this won't offend anyone,later
