Subject: Re: [VB] leaking crew cab

I used to get water in the rear seat area from the drilled holes in the
truck bed forward of the seam.  Some of the bedslat rivet holes would
leak, as would the holes used for bolting the forward bow to the bed.  I
plugged the bedslat holes by using rubber sealing washers when I finally
installed a repro set of bedslats, and the holes for the bows I plugged
with rubber 'stoppers' from a FLAPS.

Other leaky problems I have experienced:
1.  Pop-out windows not sealing to body, even with new rubber--during
heavy rain I still get a drip down into and behind the door panel so the
bottom of my rear door fills with water
2.  Wiper shaft grommets not sealing, so water drips into parcel tray
3.  Vent wing window not sealing completely to frame, even with new
rubber--only a problem during heavy blowing rain

&gt; I was wondering if there are &quot;typical&quot; spots where
&gt; water gets into a spittie, more specifically, a crew
&gt; cab. Mine has all new weather stripping but everytime
&gt; it rains or I wash it, it gets considerable water in
&gt; the floorboard of the rear seat section. I know one
&gt; place it gets in when I'm drivning in heavy rains is
&gt; through the upper fresh air vents. I'm gonna try to
&gt; address that issue this afternoon with a new seal up
&gt; there. As to the rear floor, any ideas would be
&gt; greatly appreciated. Oh, BTW, when it rains and when I
&gt; wash it, I seem to always get water in the parcel
&gt; tray. Please respond if'n ya have any ideas 'bout
&gt; this.
