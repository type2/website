Subject: Re: [VB] Running cool, too cool?

Hey Al,
I would think maybe you said it yourself, too rich. What's your carb
and what's the jetting?
I am running similar 1600sp with the new H30/31carb: mains 112.5,
pilot 65, aux maybe 45. Jetted like a late 30PICT carb, which I am
essentially pretending I have. I've only run about 100 miles like
this, but so far I like it a lot.  The engine is getting plenty warm
but then I think it needs to in order to run efficiently, oil dipstick
gets hot but always holdable. Haven't climbed a mountain yet, that
will be a test. If I get scared of the heat I can always slip in a 115
mains, I bought this great little $3 tool that allows me to swap mains
without removing the carb.
But if you just want to raise the temp a bit, try sticking a rag in
the fan or shedding that pesky hoover bit...
Good luck,
Joel and the '64 Sundial

Checked the archives, and most need the opposite. My 1600 SP seems to
run just a tad too cool. No guages, I am all stock. Heat sux.

No preheat to OE aircleaner, yet.
Heater boxes, Dansk HD. Stock heat system intact. Drools out lukewarm
at
defrosters. Oil dipstick could be held without problems after any run.
Feels about 120?-125?
Stock exhaust.
Stock fuel system.
Doghouse, well sealed at all tin connections.
Hoover bit intact.
New everything.

Besides being too RICH, anything else to check out to slightly
increase
oil temps/heat output?

Dwell at 50.
Timing with 009 done dynamically to 28 at 2500+ rpm. Static turns out
around 9.


Al
