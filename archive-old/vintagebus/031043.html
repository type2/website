Just got 'home' (a condo in Del Mar with Mom &amp; Dad this week) from the
road rally put on by the SV2's in San Diego.  Had a great time. 
Russell, Chris, and the gang put on a great rally.  They had us up and
down the peninsulas, taking breaks at wastewater treatment plants, and
on numerous occasions gave us the opportunity to test out our brakes.  
Glad to say that only one bus did not make it, but that was rather more
by choice than breakdown.

  The Ghia type 34 made it in record time (of course 10 times more
points were deducted for being early than late) so this will probably
not get reported in the SV2's next news letter.  The other buses, double
cab, and the Mercedes made the trip in good time.  The picnic at the end
was a great time to recap and tell stories from along the way.  We even
had lunch supplies provided by the non-finishing folks in the blue and
gold bus.  We had a story as a sea gull kamikaze dive bombed our bus,
striking the emblem with a load thud.  

  We had the opportunity to see parts of San Diego that even natives
were not aware of.  Did you know about the national cemetery, where
James Stewart and Elizabeth Taylor are buried, where Kansas City BBQ is,
or the wooden roller coaster?

  We all got lost a little (was that the third light or the fourth),
found a little (hey cannollis!!!), stole a little (ok Scott, where did
you put all those bonus point flyers?), confused a little (so there were
no kites at Kite park and Starbucks changed their sign), rerouted a
little (uh ... Russell was that a left or a right or a typo?), adventure
a little (no I still do not like suspension foot bridges, especially
ones built in 1912) and outplayed a little (I know we should go right
but they are behind us so fake left.)

  We were treated fantastic for the distant participants including an
impromptu adventure at Seaport afterwards. Thank you all for the great
day. 


  Time to slip into the hot tub and turn in.

Cruisin in first in the 59 ddr w/t with 65 EZ camper 

Note names may have been changed to protect us since we don't remember
them all.  Thanks again
