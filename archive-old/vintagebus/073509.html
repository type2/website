Hi Frank,
You need a charged battery, the ignition switched to run position, brake 
pedal pushed down with working brake system, but you do not need the engine 
running to get the brake lights working.  If you need to keep the ignition 
switch left on for more than a minute or two with the engine not running 
remove the small wire off the coil going to the distributor or risk burning 
the points out!  BTDT.
