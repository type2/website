 Was discussing 6v-12v with a friend last night, 
 and he mentioned that there was a heat dissipation
 factor... I never considered that before.  
 The larger (12v) flywheel can absorb more heat than
 the smaller (6v) one can.  It is probably a minimal 
 difference, but a lot of minimal differences in cooling
 can add up to a cooler running vehicle.  In particular,
 a cooler starter which increases starting reliability.
 It's been between 101 and 110 this month, where I live,
 so cooling issues have been on my mind a lot :-)

Hi,
Since the flywheel is in apretty much sealed area it will not cool the engine.
As for cooling the starter it is not near a exaust system as in other cars so
we have never had problems with a starter running hot.  The few we know who
thought that they were having a hot starter causing starting problems, turned
out to be needing a cleaning of the electrical system.  That way the starter
got more voltage to push the warm and thusly more compression in the engine to
a quicker and more reliable start.  If you are worried about cooling then get
a dog house cooling system adapted for the type4 cooler, the wider 35 mm fan
and 2:1 lower pulley.  Plus just go thru the engine to improve the cooling
system i.e. adding a little to the cooling tin to close any gaps or holes,
opening up the fins on the heads and cylinders, and polishing the exuast ports
in the heads.      Eric &amp; Barb
