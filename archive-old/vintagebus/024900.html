 I was waiting for some smart guy in my local area to pipe up with that
one.
Let me tell you, with the frames out it is DAMN windy on the highway!

One thing I have always been impressed with in the window design of
splitties is that you can run down the road with the vent wing shut and
slider open and get almost no wind.

I persoanlly have no trouble resting my arm out the open window, and
have the farmers tan to prove it.
