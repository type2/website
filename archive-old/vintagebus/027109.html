&gt; PSS, a friend of mine who owns a 21 window deluxe, was wondering where the
&gt; water drains to from his sunroof.

In my deluxe the water drains onto the non-original bed on acceleration.
If I had a back seat it would drain onto that. On deceleration it drains
onto the maps I keep behind my seat and onto my passenger's neck and
shoulders. I've had a bunch of sunroofs on this bus over the years and
the only solution I've ever found is to just carry a big stack of old
towels when you hit the road.
