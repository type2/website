&gt; &gt; i've done quite a few 6v&lt;&gt;12v flywheel swaps.  From 40h up.

None.;)  bought a junk 1200 longblock, put the flywheel straight off my 74
superbeagle engine (that had lost the dowel son the front main...) and
bolted it on. (1600 dp)..no! scratch that.  the flywheel had actually come
off the original 1500sp (68 bug) that was frozen. (i'd pulled the motor
from my autostick 74 and put that flywheel on it..)

That block (purported to run..) had a hole in 3, so i took it back, he
gimme another 1200 (all the while telling me they were 1500sps..hehe..)
that i had to remove the 6v 180 flywheel from, (and return..).

put the same 74 flywheel on it, and vwallah.

Never had any problems w/ that setup.
