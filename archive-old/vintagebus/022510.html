&gt;is a 61 so i have a small back window are there rear mount safaris?that

I use those nylon strap-racks, which hold the board securely, and remove
easily.  You shouldn't plan on leaving a board on a bus unattended anyway,
as it's just too tempting of a target.

Sticking it out the back window looks cool, but in real life is liable to
just get it dinged up.  Also, driving with the back window open sucks in
all kindsa nasty stuff from the exhaust.
