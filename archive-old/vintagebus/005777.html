Well, finally back on line after total loss of my os, so much for windows
2000. Boy the mail sure piles up fast! I've seen the Riviera sales manual on
the wet westy site, but does anyone have any copies of the owners manual
supplement or was there even such a beast. Trying to figure out how
everything works on the new to me 77 and theres some different stuff, like
the black plastic container under the drivers side rocker. I think I've got
most of it figured out but it be nice to be sure.
thanks all
