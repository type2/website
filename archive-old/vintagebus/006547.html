&gt;Except, of course, for those tanks designed to operate on their sides!
&gt;
&gt;It's OK to transport a normal propane tank on its side with the valve
&gt;closed.  It must be upright to draw gas properly.


Hoo boy - I gotta jump in here on this one. :-)  If the tanks are supposed
to be kept upright, then why do forklifts, like the ones I use at work,
carry their tanks on their sides?
