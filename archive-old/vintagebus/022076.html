&gt;A few weeks ago I wrote a rescue story on a 62 &quot;westy?&quot; camper that a friend
&gt;picked up.
&gt;It has a submarine hatch.  The interior is all white (and I mean ALL white)
&gt;formica which is what makes me think it is not a westy based on what I have
&gt;seen in the past.  No cab dividers to speak
&gt;of (im speaking of the metal that usually goes behind the seats in a walkthru
&gt;or bench).  The front bench seat back swivels and/or removes making the bed
&gt;which goes all the way up to the steering wheel.
&gt;I threw out a guess that maybe it was a american made camper.   What is it???

SO-35 Westfalia.  The real deal.  Not a common Westy.
