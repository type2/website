&gt;
&gt;Just how fast does your bus go??

I haven't tried to find the top end on my Bus yet.  I got it into
Fourth without lugging it once, so that was probably 45 MPH or so.
Even though I have replaced the brake lines, hoses, and master
cylinder, there are still some things that need attention before
I start trying to break any land speed records.

&quot;The ability to stop is often more important than any other capability -
 humans, cars, whathaveyous.&quot;
