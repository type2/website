&gt;i need advice on how much i should expect to pay
&gt;for a complete brake job (master cyl. and all), or if it is worth it just
to
&gt;do it myself. or if it is even possible for me to attempt this myself. i
&gt;dont know much about what to do, so any advice would be much appreciated.


Absolutely change the flex hoses. No, you can't tell by looking at them if
they are good. The outside isn't the part doing the braking. They need to be
done every two years, at most, along with a full flush of the fluid. I
wouldn't replace any of the other bits unless they are visibly leaking or
you are certain they have failed. Wait till after the flush, hoses, and
adjustment, then see if you need anything else. The master cylinder very
seldom fails, but is one of the first things most people replace for just
about any braking problem. The hoses fail internally all the time, causing
pulling, fading, warped drums, etc. The brakes go un-adjusted, causing mushy
brakes as well as leaking wheel cylinders, but people tend to replace the
master cylinder instead. Go figure.
