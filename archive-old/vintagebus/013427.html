&gt; We use, however, for mid sixties and up aircooleds, the third numeral in

I would certainly stay with that for the _Model_Year_.  All I was
saying is that the manufacturing of a particular model year
started before August 1 according to the manufacturing date found
on Production Plates in the 1965, 1966 and 1967 model years.

&gt; Wouldn't the august 1 date and the vin given by Lester Prosser seem to
&gt; coroborate this &quot;urbann legend&quot;?

He was talking about VIN 216.000.001 and he said it was made on
August 1.  It could have been.  I just doubt it because of
records I have on other 1966 model year buses.  Only Lester can
answer that.

&gt;&gt;  And, Jack,
&gt;&gt;  yours was made between June 22 and June 29 probably the 23rd or

&gt;  Actually, mine was made on June 21, 1965

I'm not surprised.  I used the three following known chassis
numbers and production dates to extrapolate your date.  What I
didn't allow for shows up more clearly in the first five I know
of in the 1966 model year.

1965 Model - Chassis 170,044 - June 22
1965 Model - Chassis 174,001 - June 29 - Tuesday
1965 Model - Chassis 174,370 - July 1 - Thursday

I showed the first two of the following in my previous post, but
didn't follow through.  As the chassis numbers increase the dates
jump around and are not consecutive.  It's a phenomenon I have
not been able to fully explain, but has never been more than a
few days.

1966 Model - Chassis 000,363 - July 6 - Tuesday
1966 Model - Chassis 000,454 - July 7 - Wednesday
1966 Model - Chassis 001,090 - July 6
1966 Model - Chassis 002,667 - July 9
1966 Model - Chassis 002,686 - July 8

Can anyone offer an explanation of why they'd be making #363
and #1090 on July 6, then start #454 on July 7?

This is one of the reasons I've learned not to take VW &quot;verbatim&quot;
in their pronouncements...and the biggest reason I'm looking to
collect all the Production Plate data I can.  The NEATO Old Bus
Registry has over 300 Production Plates in a database and I'm
trying to make sense of it all.  Anyone willing to contribute,
feel free to pass along the numbers on your tags.
