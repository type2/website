Thanks Ric.  Anyone that is interested in joining NEATO can send a check 
or money order made out to &quot;NEATO&quot; in the amount of $20 (domestic) or $30 
(overseas) to:

NEATO\Old Bus Review
335 Atlanta Street
Marietta, GA 30060
USA

If you are not familiar with our newsletter and want to see why Old Bus 
Review is considered to be the best vintage bus newsletter by most 
people, send me your mailing address and I will send you a sample issue 
and a membership registration form.

If the membership will send more material in to be published, I will be 
happy to go from a 16 page format to 20 or 24 pages.  Remember, NEATO is 
YOUR club, and like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it...

&gt;&lt;I think the only chance of a decent type 2 oriented publication would
&gt;be something like the NEATO newsletter.  And guess what?  It already exists!
&gt;If membership was larger, the resulting fundage could support a larger,
&gt;cooler newsletter.  Maybe even color pix like the one Ty Hodges
&gt;does (Cascade kombi's?).  And the classifieds are to die for!&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I got the latest issue from NEATO this weekend at Oktoberbus (from Dave 
&gt;Easterwood) and pulled it out of the bus last night to read it. Reminded me 
&gt;how much I missed it and the classifieds. I let my membership slide when I 
&gt;sold my splitty, but gonna renew tonight.
&gt;
&gt;Lets put &quot;our money with our mouth is&quot; and support the type2 newsletter that 
&gt;is already out there! 
&gt;
&gt;Dave might want to post the address again as I am at work.
