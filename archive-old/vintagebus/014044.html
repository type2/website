Hi.

The recently purchased '67 came complete with some pretty sloppy steering.
Local NEATO boss Neil Picket was kind enough to drive the bus and crawl
under to check it out for me. His diagnosis was a well worn drag link and a
beam in need of lotsa grease. Steering box seems fine. Also the steering
wheel is about 30 degrees off but it is my understanding that a proper front
end setup should correct that. I wanna go ahead and straighten out the front
end mess and put some new tires on the bus before I start driving it. I will
at this point refraim from starting the tire war on the list. If you have
tire recomendation please p-mail them to me:)

As long as the draglink is being replaced should I go ahead and replace tie
rods,damper, and or anything else? It looks like BusDepot_dot_com has most of
what I need parts wise. Any recomendations on what kinda puller I should
get? I am gonna replace the schocks. I have driven KYBs on a bay for a while
and felt ok about them but I have been cautioned that KYBs feel quite stiff
on a split. How about Boges of good ol' cheap Monroes up there?

I recently spoke to a gentleman that drove a 1965 bus for about twelve
years. When he purchased it in the mid 80s it had EMPI antisway bars
installed on the front and rear. He stated that the bus handled like no
other had ever owned. Anyone install an aftermarket antisway setup?Is it
worth it and is now the time to do it while other front end work is being
handled?

I really wanna do this right and do it once so I can move on to other
mechanical areas of repair so any advice is welcome.
