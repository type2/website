List:

I'm getting the gas tank from the '59 Westy ready to paint.  The original owner had a guage installed I believe in '62 or '63, when that modern advancement came out.  I've yanked the guage, and now want to dispose of (donate, trade, sell) the sender.  I was looking in my parts book and there apears to have been a part, part #111 201 571, Cover- Tank Unit Opening.  I always figured pre gas gauge buses had a gas tank without a hole in it for the sender.  I mean, what purpose is the hole for, cleaning it out?

Can anyone confirm or deny this hole cover?  If there is such a monster, I'd like to acquire one.  If anyone has one for sale, trade, etc. please let me know.  I'll trade you a nice sender for it.

TIA.

Robert
