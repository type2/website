To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

Let's not talk about how this group is no more, let's 
share some info on who they were and if they are still active.
Is there any of their tech writing still out there?
Any one have any ideas?
Wasn't ther links to Dooken's (sp?) used bus bits?
Aloha 
Ken
