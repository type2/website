Subject: Mexican engine cylinder head torque
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

  I'm finally getting around to retorquing the heads on the new mexican 
1600cc dual port i put in last year but still only have about a 1000 miles 
on. 
  I thought i had read that the amount of torgue differed from that of the 
original engines, which were torqued to just over 20 ft lbs. Could someone 
let me know what the torque value should be.
