Hi andre,

Looking at your pix it is NOT a panel.  It is a 64 kombi sundial
conversion.  In the pix to the right you can see that popouts are in that
window, and there is a window behind the cargo doors. the panel sundials
didnt have that &quot;aft of cargo door&quot; window, and especially didnt have it
with a standard fixed glass/popout sized opening.

peas,

Steve

&gt; Well, the inside of it has been finished in teak wood?????? don't ask me.
&gt; It has one sea that folds down, bed??? Heck, I'll be able to provide you
&gt; with more when I pick it up. For now that's all I got and I think it's
&gt; cool that it runs. Has new brakes, new battery, hard start
&gt; relay..........what's that? It's in a need of a nose job. Compared to the
&gt; one I used to own (for more money) which was a total cancer case this one
&gt; is a lot better. What do you expect for a grand???? Except for one thing.
&gt; The first one, as you can see on the pics, was a DeLuxe. God, I miss
&gt; it!!!
&gt; Thanks volks.
