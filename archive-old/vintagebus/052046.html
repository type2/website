Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

Rereading the original post and my response just now, I wanted to remind
you that the wiper arm will sit lower on the windshield.  That is why the
bottom of the arm just might hit the body.  To install, set the hole on
the shaft, with the spinable shaft on the adapter at the bottom, sticking
out toward you.  Open the &quot;hinge&quot; on the wiper arm, and put it on that
small, spinable shaft and set the screw.  When you push the arm back
toward the body, the half moon cut-out that is sticking up goes into the
spring that is on the underside of the wiper arm.  In other words, you
won't see that cut-out when the arm is down.  When you want to disengage,
just pull the arm away from the glass as normal, but it will spin on that
shaft on the adapter so you can move it freely, and push it in your
one-eyed duck.  

HINT:  DO NOT TURN YOUR WIPERS ON WHEN IT IS DISENGAGED!!!!!!   It can
pull the blade from the rest and it will hang down.  

Hope that helps.

Adam
