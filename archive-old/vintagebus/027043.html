Subject: re:  How'd they keep the louvred windows sealed?

Provided the mechanisms are working correctly and the panes are pressing
cleanly together, the windows seal the weather out very well. I think
there are some foam seals in the windows, too, but not between the
panes...

As far as heat goes, make sure your heater hoses are good, your boxes
are open (I have to wire mine open with coat hangers right now) and
connected to the heater pipe that runs from front to back. The heater
pipe should be insulated. 

Places where heat can escape and drafts can come in are thru poor door
and window seals. Having all your ceiling, door and kick panels in place
help hold the heat in.

On some of the coldest days around here, I use a small propane heater
which hangs from my dashboard to help out...
