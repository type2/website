Subject: Re: [VB] todays fuels questions

&gt;Hi Folks
&gt;I have heard alot of conversation on Todays Fuels lately... and as it really
&gt;adversly effects the Aircooled engine,, I thought I ask for some input,
&gt;
&gt;I have been told by different aircooled mechanics, from garden tractor to
&gt;motorcycle to Vw..... that todays fuel is oxygen bearing fuel,   [Which is a
&gt;different problem than the no lead fuel]
&gt;
&gt;Is there any fact to that?  Is there test markets of oxygen bearing fuel??

Yup. Quite some time now, depending on your location. Stuff EATS older
rubber, too, many car fires in Cali when they first started using it, etc.
Will rot your fuel pump diagphram, too.


&gt;Seems to me that an aircooled needs to be tuned to compensate for this,,
&gt;with reduced compression ratio's.. richer fuel / air mixtures,, and retarded
&gt;timing numbers....

Again, yup. Lewis has been working on VWs since 66 or so - motorcycles
before that. Don't get him started on the new gas :)
He gets real annoyed w/ me when I tell him that the VW manual says I need a
125 main/140emulsion jets etcetc for my set-up - he will roll his eyes and
say &quot; Sure, for the gas they were usin' when they WROTE that!!!&quot;  He just
tunes by feel, so it's hard to get concrete pointers outta him, but he does
say to go richer... and has been complaining that new gas gave him poorer
MPG to begin with, so he hated to do it, but was seeing toasty valves on
low-milage heads recently.
He'll be down this week, I'll get out his soapbox for him :)
