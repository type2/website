&lt;&lt; thank you very much for your help. one idiot question, though. do i have a 
single or dual MC? it is a 66 and the brake system is stock. &gt;&gt;
Hi Casey,
The 1966 system could be either and unless you have extremely good records 
who really knows!
Only easy way to tell is that single MC has a reseviour that is shaped like a 
pop can and only connects to the MC at one place.  1967 only (and the 1972 
and later MC in a pre-1968 bus.) dual MC reseviour is a long retangle running 
most of the length of the MC and attaches to the MC in two places.
  There even is a 1966 only dual MC that used a square shaped reseviour and 
had two legs attaching it to it's MC.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS If you have the single circuit MC please do get a dual circuit MC instead 
for the safety of your bus and you!   Eric&amp;Barb
