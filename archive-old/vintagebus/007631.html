I checked the archives first,and found nothing conclusive.  what actual size
(i.e.. 185/r14) did stock buses come with?  and second what is the actual
measurement of the tire (i.e. mm in circumference or whatever)??  I ask this
because....on a b*g 15&quot; rim a stock size now is a 165r15.  but from the
factory it came with a much taller biasply (normally continental) tire.  the
discussion on tires has gone the route of calculating mph on different rated
tires.  sometimes losing a significant amount of rpm with a smaller tire.
according to my searching this morning a 185sr14 is different than a 185r14.
and a 185r/14 can be of different sizes dimensionally from manufacturer to
manufacturer.

so why not cut through the differences in companies and all the clutter of
the different numbers on the tires, and just find a correct weight rating
tire that has the same dimensions (i.e.. circumference, ratio, etc...sorry I
don't know the correct terms) and then your little vw motor will turn at the
correct rpm it was designed.

so does anyone have a source to find specs on an ORIGINAL vw tires.
obviously vw designed the vans to run a specific weight handling tire, I am
assuming they put the correct tire on (small enough yet to handle taking off
with loads and yet tall enough to not have the engine explode due to high
rpms)

any thoughts folks??
