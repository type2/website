Subject: Ellis safe in Rhode Island

Being brief for once as I'm on someone else's
computer.
All is fine so far. Amazed at continued lack of
security. Expected cavity search. Foiled sexually
again! ;-)

Wedding is still on so no need for brass knuckles.
Oldest autos in Rhode Island are 86 Cavalier station
wagons and Jeff's nice 13 window deluxe project.
Plants and trees actually grow in RI. Paula is
surprised at her perception that the trees seem to be
&quot;in the way&quot; of the view as based on typical Phoenix
mindset. R.I and Conn residents think that we
Arizonans have funny accents. 

Complete report regarding travels if necessary upon
return. Maybe not...
