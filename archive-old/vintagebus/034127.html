Another bus just left the beautiful shores of Lake Havasu to the smog filled
canyons of California. Just sold my 63 double cab to a fellow from
Fullerton, cali., he drove out in a rental truck with trailer (5 hrs) to
look at the bus, I guess he was determined to buy a bus, being all he had
was a verbal description of the bus before he came out. He looked at the
bus, bought it, we loaded it on the trailer and he was off in the Sunset
back to Cali. all in less then an hour. What people will do to get a bus, or
did I just sell it to cheap. At least he was excited and can't wait to get
it on the road, this is the second bus he has ever owned and I'm sure he'll
join the list for advice and moral support on restoring the beast.

Soon for sale 1966 hardtop deluxe walkthrough, very straight, rustfree bus,
with new complete original style interior (platinum),red and white paint,
new engine and probally trans.New brakes, tires, etc. etc.


also the famous swap panel will be up on the market again, putting in stock
trans and engine, to help reduce the price,
1776 single port and 3.88 rancho trans going in my double door.

HAPPY SAINT PADDY DAY
