Message-ID: &lt;7mo3vt$1hls_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

 roger, i just went through the ordeal. i took the double cab to the
sandblasters. went it came back there wasn't enough to repair. i
purchased a replacement frame piece from ronnie. i cut all 3 pillars 5&quot;
up. i then cut a horizontal line straight across the nose clip from
door to door 2&quot; below the
the rolled edge. i then cut another horizontal line all the way across
the dash at the edge where the dash meets the frame. this weekend will
be spent grinding &amp; filling &amp; primering. hope this helps. hope this
helps...terry

&gt; So, in it appears now is the time for me to tackle the Rust removal
and
&gt; slight repair of the windsheild area of my bus. It seems pretty
straight
&gt; forward except for one thing.
&gt; 
&gt; When you do the rust treatment (POR, Correless, etc..., TAR ) do you
just do
&gt; the outside or am I going to need to remove the parcel tray,
kickkpanels and
&gt; try and get the back side?
&gt; 
&gt; My plan is remove as much rust as I can, treat the rest, fill in the
holes,
&gt; prime, rattle can paint then install my windows (all in under 5
minutes
&gt; flat).  Any other reccomendations.
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS!!
