Now that I have some time to sit down and write... (since I'm at work :))

Here's some highlights on the paint and body work on the '55:
Start to finish, the project took exactly one week.

* Removed engine and gas tank, cleaned up engine compartment with paint thinner
* Replaced the battery tray
* Small rust pinholes in rockers welded up.  This is a pita, because you end up welding a larger hole than you think...
* POR-15 battery area 
* POR-15 inside bottoms of doors in seal area, and the sear area on cargo
door rocker
* Wire wheel and POR-15 entire gutter
* Fix hacked holes in dash by cutting and welding pieces into holes.
* pull dent in rear corner, below wheel arch
* weld up air scoop holes
* Drill holes for new antenna, and weld up holes from old one.  I think you'll
find my new antenna setup quite cool!
* Sand off surface rust on panels with #40 and wire wheel.
* re-do filler in lower section of nose.  Underneath about 1/8&quot; of bondo there is a layer of lead!
* prime entire bus with surfacing primer, about 3 coats
* sand entire bus with #180
* use glazing putty in small dings
* re-prime
* sand entire bus with #320-#400
* paint.  Painting a bus is a PITA.  This is my 3rd bus, 5th car I've painted,
and I swear it gets more difficult each time.   I think it's because my
standards are rising.  
* There is a LOT of surface area on a bus.

You *can* use POR-15 on the body, *if* you prime it while it's still wet.

This bus was actually in really good shape, it just *looked* bad because of
the surface rust on the body.  There was no significant collision damage to
deal with.   I still need to do the front floors and should replace one
outrigger, but those can wait for now.

Next will be to color sand and polish, then re-assemble.  I also have a set
of bumpers and wheels to sandblast and paint.  I also have to fix up the 
engine lid and apron. And And And...

I was going to put safaris in it, but I didn't get them yet, so that may be
a project for later.  I'd still like to have a set in this bus.  I also
have an ambulance fan I'm thinking of adding.
