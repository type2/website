Shawn and fellow listees

We go out to the middle of the Black Rock several
times a year to 'let our hair down'. I have never been
to such a isolated open place where anyone can and
does whatever they/we want ! 
The Black Rock is the greatest place to throw a
Frisbee, there is nothing to run into or trip over for
many many miles !!(see pics)
 Every year there is a Golf game laid out there where
each hole is something like a mile or more in length.
I have two pics at a photo site of our 67 Sundial in
the Black Rock at:

Maybe someday I will put together a Bus Camp out at
the Black Rock. Maybe we could get the worlds record
for the largest VW Bus Camp Circle. 
Someone call Guiness.
Man-O-Man what a party that could be. There is so much
to do and places to explore all around the area
including a drive through the world famous High Rock
Canyon.

&gt; Well you are right clothing is optional. Though I
&gt; would not recommend letting it all hang out during
the day. The sun down there can get you in trouble. I
have been in the valley several times on rock hounding
&gt; expeditions and I always seem to make it over to the
&gt; springs for some socializing. I have met some
remarkable people there. I would say that a good
amount of people tend to were clothes while visiting.
except maybe when soaking in the springs.
&gt; Basically it is a place that you can do everything
&gt; that you could do at burning man and not have to be
in competition with some yuppie types from the bay
area.
