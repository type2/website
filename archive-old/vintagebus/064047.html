Subject: Re: 'BENTVW' ... sad story also sad not on show sat. in fla

Ick, Not a pretty site David. Thats scarey. It was bent up so it will bend
back, with damage in the rails from rust it might be easiest and better to
remove the damaged section of frame BEFORe trying to straighten. This
project would be best done on a frame jig, support the from and rear of the
frame, then pull down at the damage point, with the frame rusty i'd take out
the section of frame and replace it while its on the jig. And also probably
the upper area sheetmetal at the same time. By removing and replacing the
frame sections, you wouldn't have to deal with metal bounce as in just
bending it back. Any beefing or plating should be done on the inside of the
frame and then the inner box section can be welded back and hide those
plates. Probably not gonna be a cheap fix, but hey does Dave do anything the
cheap way? would you? Do it the right way the first time and be done with
it.
ps , thats almost as sad as the lady at Bulli Brigade saturday with the 64
burgandy and white bus. Details fresh out of paint shop thursday, got
slapped in the front nose by a highway gator( truck tire cap) and really did
a no. on it. thankfully she came thru unscathed , well frazzld nerves. The
busses  can be fixed or replaced lives are a bit different. later
