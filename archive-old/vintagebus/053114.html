&gt; The way I see it- 20/50 is thicker than 30 w  in hot AND cold weathers.
&gt; It's thinner than 40 wt at least in hot weathers, haven't checked in cool
&gt; weathers.

The way the ratings work is that the oil viscosity is measured at two
different temperatures.  If the rating is taken at the higher temperature,
the rating is the &quot;straight grade&quot; weight.  If the rating is taken at the
lower temperature, the rating is appeneded with a W.  The &quot;W&quot; stands for
&quot;winter&quot;, not &quot;weight&quot;  The straight rating number and the &quot;W&quot; rating
number have nothing to do with each other and cannot be compared.  That
is why you can buy 20W20 oil.  This is an oil that has a rating of 20 at
high temperatures and a rating of 20W at lower temperatures.

A 20W50 oil will have higher viscosity than a 40 oil at operating
temperature.  At low temperature, we can't compare them, since the
&quot;straight 40&quot; oil has no low temperature &quot;W&quot; rating.
