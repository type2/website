&lt;&lt; What do you run on a road camper bus for rear shocks?? &gt;&gt;

Hi P&amp;C,
We got our 1960 panel with GR-2 KYB shocks on it and have never noticed tire 
wear like you describe.  Have installed about 50,000 miles ago the Gas Adjust 
KYB shock on our 63 SC and have noticed no tendancy to angle the rear tires 
in such a way that would cause such wear.  Have had a much better ride, 
especially with up to 1,000 Lbs. loads in our SC since installing the KYB 
shocks replacing the original from the factory shocks that while they worked 
were way too weak.
We wonder if you are running cheapy tires or if your bus was lowered at one 
time and when raised back up the DPO went too high?   Eric&amp;Barb
