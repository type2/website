All this about shipping with Greyhound just reminds me of how much we've
lost in the way of services over the years.

Not so very long ago you could ship your stuff anywhere in N. America,
quickly and inexpensively, by train through the Railway Express Agency.  The
only real size limitation was that it had to fit through the huge side doors
of a baggage car.

Folks would crate up a complete automobile and ship it across the country in
~3 days...

FWIW.....
