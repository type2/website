Oh, and that's the bus I stumbled upon on the day I picked up my '55 SC.
It was sitting at a gas station turned into a recycling center.  This
&quot;citizen of lesser mental faculties&quot; (notice I said &quot;lesser&quot; and not
&quot;reduced&quot; - I doubt he ever had much more than that) yelled at us the whole 
time to move the bus; &quot;Dish ish privut propurty, you have to move you van!&quot; [sic]
over and over and over and over...

&gt; &gt; Yep, that's the one. Looks like it's carrying a flea market. Had to do a search on 2037.jpg to find it.
