Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Panelling - Is it Really Birch?

&gt; So, have we all been under the wrong impression all of these years.  Or is
this guy smokin' crack and clueless on old veneer?  Let's not forget veneer
is his business, he had more types of veneer in his warehouse than you could
count.  ???????????
&gt;

No, it is really birch. The stuff the side and roof panels are made of,
right? Yes indeed. Can't get the old growth stuff anymore. Stuff we can get
now has more grain activity. The early cabinets aren't birch, though.
Mahogogany, Cuban unless I miss my guess. Possible explanation for the white
Formica models? Cover up the Cuban mahogany they were made from since
Customs wasn't real cool about importing Cuban stuff to the US anymore.
After disassembling some early Westy cabinets it is clear that they
manufactured their own plywood. The early cabinets are made of board core
plywood, but the veneer grain direction varies according to where they
wanted the strength. On cabinet sides it tended to run perpendicular to the
core direction. On cabinet tops it ran parallel. This would explain how they
could have made the long panel with the fabled vertical grain. I have to
admit to having never seen this. In every Westy I have ever dismembered, the
long side panel was made from a simple luann doorskin, which are commonly
available at Home Depot and has the grain running longways. This both on
original subhatch campers and on late splits and I have no reason to believe
they weren't as original as the birch panels on the rest of the sides and
roof. They had the same fabric reinforcement glued in spots on the back
sides and I have never seen that on a doorskin. That is a mystery to me
still. Maybe you all can enlighten me on the where's and whens of these
vertical grain long panels so I can keep my eye out for one. I have only
seen them in buses people have restored and they fabricated them. Westfalia
could easily have done it, I just haven't seen an original yet and I find it
surprising since I assume we are all talking the same years of Westy's.
