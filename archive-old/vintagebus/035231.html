&lt;&lt; On another note a friend of mine came over and squeezed one of the axle 
boots and air came out, he then said that it would not seal if air can pass. 
This does not make sense to me. I have the seam placed at a 45 degree angle 
towards the back. With this it does not seem like the seam should need to be 
air tight. Any thoughts on this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
In the VW bus shop manual Vw states that a sealant must be used between the 
seam surfaces.  We have been using high temp silicon finger painted over 
these surfaces.  Definitely helps keep out more of the road dust!  Eric&amp;Barb
