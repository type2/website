Nice Color Choice!

Look at ours: www.63splitty_dot_com -- looks really similar.

I just started the site for it. Not much there but a couple of pictures. We found this 
bus in February, and could NOT pass it up! :) We love it, and it's my daily driver. We're working on the inside to make it a camper, but the coolest thing about it so far?

A LAWN on the INSIDE! :)

The theme will be &quot;Jungle Room&quot; on the inside... Giraffe print interior panels in the back.
