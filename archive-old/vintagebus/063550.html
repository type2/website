Hey Y'all,
here's my situation: 71 Westy, 1600 DP.  Runs GREAT!  Holds idle nicely when
engine is cold, but once the engine get up to operating temperature, 180
degrees oil temp, it keeps wanting stall at idle. As long as I'm driving with
throttle open, it still runs great until I come to a stop, then it spits and
sputters and wants to die.  I've just put on a new carb, thinking this may
have beeen the problem, but it still does the same thing.  I also recently
changed to the stock dual vac dizzy from a 009, but it continues to have the
same problem with BOTH dizzy's (so it is not a vac leak, because the 009 is
centrifugal only). Any ideas what the problem could be? Fuel Pump? Where
should I look next?

Peace, John Baker
