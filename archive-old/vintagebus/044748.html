&gt;  I have a '71, which came equipped with the 38A generator.  The belt was 
&gt; straight with what I assume is the original 38A pulley.  I 
&gt;  converted to an alternator and used the same pulley.  The belt is still 
&gt; straight.  What'd the difference in the exotic 38A pulley?  From what 
&gt;  I can see, the extra length of the 38A generator was compensated for in 
the 
&gt; front (FIF) end with different tin, not in the pulley end.  The 
&gt;  38A pulley seems to be exactly the same as the 30A setup in our bug.
&gt;  

the offset is different.  

Somehow I created this wierd set up in my westy that takes a small 6V gen 
pulley, and a small belt - fun to figure out which size belt you need when 
you don't know.  If I use a regular pulley on it the offset is wrong and the 
pulleys dont line up striaght which is a belt eating setup.  If I use a 38A 
pulley on it is the offset is right,  and I use the regular size belt.  This 
will be interesting for an easy swap to see how using a smaller gen pulley 
affects the cooling.   But now the voltage regulator is dead.
