&lt;&lt; Can a 211-251-053J interchange with a 211-251-053E? Whats the difference
 in exhaust from the 34hp and the 40hp?

I dunno that you can.  I haven't checked to see if the head outlets bolt up 
the same, or if the spacing  is the same, but if you compare intake 
manifolds, you'll see where they attach it is different.

Do you have a 34 (I assume 36hp) motor or a 40hp?   which are you looking for 
a muffler for? I have found 40hp bus mufflers pretty cheap at swaps.
