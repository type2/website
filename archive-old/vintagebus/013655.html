Just to complete the list

A 16&quot; bug wheel is 3.5&quot;
A 16&quot; bus wheel is 4&quot;
A 16&quot; early porsche slotted (wide 5) is 3 1/4&quot;

I have also seen a 4-slot 16&quot; wheel, which looks like a bus wheel,
but I don't know what it came from.  Don't recall the width.

&gt; A wide 5 bug wheel is 4&quot; wide.
&gt; A wide 5 bus wheel up to 67 is 4.5&quot; wide.
&gt; A wide 5 bus wheel from 68 to 70 is 5&quot; wide.
&gt; Are you measuring from the outside lip to the outside lip?
&gt; You measure from inside edge to inside edge where the bead sits.
