 Hi Steve,
614455 would have been built at the end of MAY60 which would have been about 
3/4 the way through the 60 model year.

&lt;&lt;In the archives i found that low hinge doors started mid-late 61 at chassis 
# 705619.&gt;&gt;
That would have been built DEC60 which would have been almost 1/2 way through 
the 61 model year.
 
&lt;&lt;So does that mean all 61's with low hinge doors have gas gagues, or that 
they all have a one year only reserve tap cable?(if indeed the gague became 
standard in 62....)  &gt;&gt;
Just because the cargo door upper hindges got lower did not lengthen the bus. 
 Since the fuel reserve cable runs under the bus it probably did not change 
due to this hindge change.  According to our parts manual the only three 
changes in length was wether it was a truck or a kombi/micro or a walkthru.
  The fuel gauge was standard 31JULY61 in chassi # 802 986.
