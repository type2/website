Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring an ammeter guage

&gt;From: Donald Morrisey &lt;dmorrisey_at_ndne_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Date: Mon, 8 Jul 2002 11:31:36 -0400 
&gt;
&gt;I tried running a 10 guage wire brom the B+ terminal on the alternator 
&gt;to the B+ terminal on the guage and then running the wire back from the
&gt;L+ terminal on the guage to the positive post on the battery.

Did you also disconnect the existing wire from B+ on the alternator
to battery positive?  If not, that's why the gauge doesn't work.  All
the current has to go through the gauge to make it work.

Also, the way you have wired it, it will probably only tell you when
the alternator is charging.  This may be what you want, but if you're
expecting to turn on the headlights with the engine off and see the
ammeter dip, it won't.  Usually an ammeter is wired so that all the
current to or from the battery, with the exception of the starter
current, goes through the ammeter.  On a Bus, this generally means
that you would disconnect the generator wire and the feed wire to the
front of the Bus at the starter, connect these two wires together to
one side of the ammeter, and connect the other side of the ammeter
back to battery positive.

Some ammeters are designed to pass most of the current through a shunt,
which can be a resistor or just a length of wire.  The advantage here
is that the shunt can go close to the battery or generator, and the
wires to the ammeter can be much smaller, like 16-18 gauge.  It's not
usually easy to tell by inspection if the meter you have wants a shunt
or not.

I hope this helps!
