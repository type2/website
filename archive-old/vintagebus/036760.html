Subject: Interior Panels - How do I keep them flat?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline



Now that the cooler weather has arrived here in Michigan, I've decided to tackle
some long neglected projects on the interior of my '58 single cab.  I've made
some nice kick panels and door panels from hardboard from the Home Depot, and at
the same time I'm reconditioning and repainting the doors.  The door panels
looked like they had never been removed, and still had the 42 year old waxed
paper stuff on the inside.

The roof panels still look good, so I've decided not to make new ones.  But the
longest piece, the one hat goes from the top of one door over the top of the
other, is warped.  I've been reading the archives and I think I can get it
flattened out again, but I'm wondering if anyone has been able to figure out a
way to keep it from warping/sagging again?   (Is it heat or humidity (or both)
that cause it to sag?)  Someone mentioned applying POR-15 to the back side.
What about gluing it to the metal roof somehow?  I bought some Evercoat (?) self
adhesive sound deadening material that I plan to apply to the roof before I put
the panel back .... maybe I could somehow glue it to that.

Any suggestions?
