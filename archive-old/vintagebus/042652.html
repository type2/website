hi all,

Im not a really tall guy (6 foot or so) but since driving my 61 a lot i
have noticed my left knee aches.  I might just be building up muscles, but
i suspect that limited legroom may be the culprit.

The other day i was riding in my friends 64 westy and noticed the great
improvement in legroom over my 61 bus.

Now, my bus is my daily transport, and i plan to take it to the southwest
this summer (2 weeks at the wheel) and alaska next summer (a month at the 
wheel), much long distance driving is in my future.

So anyway here are my knee related questions:

How much more legroom is there in a 63+ bus than in a full bench one?

Does the earlier 55-60 bench offer more legroom than the 61/62 adjustable
bench?

Has anyone &quot;enhanced&quot; an early bench in some way to move it further back
to up the legroom to match a 63+ split bench without too much alteration.
I really like the full bench, and want to keep it, but am considering all
options. (including putting in a 60 down bench and mounts if that'll help)

whew, thats a load of questions, but i think they are valid :) I like my
knees and i like my split, i want them to co-exist happily, any and all
suggestions are appreciated (including take out the kickpanel and put yer
foot under the fusebox for more legroom, but i already did that one...)

take care,

Steve
