&gt;     Who can tell me what year they ended using the chrome framed cardboard
&gt;  visors in Deluxe buses. My new 1960 has padded, but all my other 1960's era
&gt;  buses have cardboard. 
&gt;  
61 deluxes had padded sunvisors- a unique diamond pattern like the middle 
part of the 58- april 61 deluxe door panels.  In 62 padded sunvisors were 
stock on all splittes.    this is anecdoted memory info.

exact date of start?

Feb 20 61 ch 735 060  now: plastic mounting plate for the mirror holder, 
formerly die cast&quot;
meaning ?beginning of 61 style sunvisors? end of hardboard/metal edged 
sunvisors-which had chromed metal for deluxes?

31 jul 61 802 986   sun visor  now: for front seat passenger
( beginning of regular grey or green sunvisors)

are you meaning 1960 buses when you say &quot;1960s era&quot;?   the vast majority of 
60s buses do have padded sunvisors, though they can be swapped around.

I think your 60 would have come with the hardboard kind- what kind of padded 
sunvisor does it have now?  Grey? Green? White?  stamped in diamond pattern? 
or cobbled 'elephant skin'?
