just found out that the doorhandle for the cargo doors on a '67 was only made 
one year, and i can't find that either. any suggestions? tried rocky mountain 
and they don't have it. they said a '66 wouldn't work.

yes, the 67 s used a L series key, that is the difference.  The shape of the 
key is different.    If you don't mind your keys not matching (Ie having a 
dif key for the side door)  you can use  an earlier cargo door handle- they 
will fit the same.   

my first bus had 3 diff styles keys- the rear hatch T handle and the drivers 
door had one kind,   the cargo door and igntion another, and the gas door the 
3 kind.    It had a total of 5 keys though

the L series key is longer, so the handle is weaker, and can break easier.  
In 68 they made th square shaft thicker.
