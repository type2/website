BTW, Wade primered over his dove blue logo sporting original paint 56

&lt;&lt; I get to listen to wade CONSTANTLY bitching about my 57.
He wants it in a single coat of primer rather than the frankenstein style.

even had your paint out!  Im currently forming a club in support of

&gt;&gt;In &quot;Everett's Kombi&quot; news, I was bored last weekend so I hand painted a VW 
Planet logo on my Bus, I'll post a picture when I can.

The logo is covering that spot, heh-heh.  :)
