Subject: interior trinket locations  (65 deluxe)

I have been looking over the headliner job on the bus and all the little
trinkets that are intalled in the bus.  things like coat hangers, assist
straps, lights,etc.  As far a bus's from the mid 60's go, what came from
the factory?  I have seen many other's idea's of what was correct and
have been told many things, but...  Maybe you all can help or give me
your thoughts.


How many coat hangers and where should they have gone?
Same for assist straps
Where did the headliner tuck strip start and stop and what hardware held
it in place?
Dome lights.  Just the 2?
Did any of the 15/21 bus's have headliner material on the rear hatch?

Thanks for the input.
Matthew
