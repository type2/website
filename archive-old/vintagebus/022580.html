I know the feeling.  I drove about an hour one time to check out a
&quot;barndoor&quot; out in the woods...

Turned out to be a lousy-a*s '55 euro westfalia...

&gt;I dunno what words she used.&quot; I thanked him for his
&gt;time and suggested that he clarify the type of trailer
&gt;to the other potential buyers. Poof!, buzzkill and a
&gt;long drive home. Have heard of others driving much
&gt;farther to share in similar experiences. At least the
&gt;Harley and it's owner were nice. Sometimes things
&gt;*almost* work out...
