Yes and no.  I've seen it both ways.  There are drains - if they get
clogged,  then stuff will build up in there.  Otherwise they shield the
bottom of the bus.  I imagine the heat works slightly better, as the tube
is protected.

OTOH, the belly pan on the driver's side of my panel was full of mouse
nests, because of a hole in the rocker.
