Subject: lights on the fritz

hello all,

I just installed a new wireing harness in to my 67' last week.  it was alot 
easier than i had thought, but you know if its easy there is something 
wrong. i cant seem to get my brake lights to work, or my turn signals to 
flash.  i replaced to two flasher relays and have everything hooked up 
according to the diagram i got with the harness.  i took a circuit tester 
(light tester)to the stop light switches on my master cylinder and when my 
the brake pedal was pressed the light on the tester was illuminated. power 
was also found at the end of the brake loop at the flasher unit when the 
brake pedal was depressed, which leaves me to believe that the problem is 
somewhere between the relay and the rear tailights themselves.  with that, i 
checked the wireing in the back and its the way it should be.... I also 
tried shorting the connections at the mastercylinder (per jonh muir) to see 
if the brake lights came on when i did that.  they didnt.  does that mean 
that the switches are bad, and if so would that account for my turnsignals 
not working?
another thing, when i turn on the emergency flaher it makes a noise like in 
the game Operation(you know that sound when you touch the sides).  the noise 
is fast then nothing, no fashing, no noise, no nothing.  sound familiar?

would like to drive my baby again.
