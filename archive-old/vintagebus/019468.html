&gt; FYI- all the other racks I've seen that are stretched long ones, use 5 or 6 
&gt; bows... aka combo of two racks... It would'nt be impossible, but I think the 
&gt; wood may have a greater tendency to bow imho? Another thing I've found out 
&gt; the hard way... don't work with you rack on the ground as your back will feel 
&gt; it for weeks:)... Kind of scary to say my back felt like an old mans, and I'm 
&gt; only 19:) 

I'm not talking about a full-length stretch, just about 5&quot; or so.  The first rack
I put together, I did on the ground.  That sucked.  The second I did on milk
crates, which was marginally better.  Now I have a makeshift table made from
a 4x8 sheet of 3/4&quot; plywood, which makes this sort of thing *much* easier on
the old spine.

&gt; Anyway, good luck and keep us posted... I'm digging your panel w/ all of you 
&gt; upgrades... You're giving me plenty of ideas for my '59 SWR panel!!
&gt; Have you put interior panels in your busses cargo area... I'm still looking 
&gt; for ideas as to what material to use w/ minimal drilling. ( Velcro is a great 
&gt; idea Isaiah gave me)

Yeah, I'm turning into an accessory whore.  Eventually that panel will look
like one of Jerry Jess' cars.  There's a guy in Roseville that makes interior
panels for buses - he's a cabinetmaker by trade - and he made me a set.  I still
have to paint them and install them, which I hope to do before Kelly Park.  He
did the rear quarters so that the whole panel, all the way around the corner, was
a single piece.  He also does cab dividers.
