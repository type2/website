That's what I think they are for, heat shields for the sump.

Not always true.  The airflow in the back of the bus is pretty hard to
define without a wind tunnel.


  The point was to provide additional cooling while
&gt; at stop lights etc when there would be minimal outside air/vehicle
&gt; movement. The sump is the closet part of the engine to the road.  On a

&gt; nice 100+ degree day stopped at a long light on a black road at high
&gt; noon I'm guessing the temperature 12&quot; off the road would be higher
&gt; than that of the air coming off the cylinders.  Even if it isn't, it
&gt; only needs to be as cool or cooler than the sump to be effective.

That air is pretty hot coming off of the heads!  I'd much rather have
ambient air on the sump then air from the heads.
