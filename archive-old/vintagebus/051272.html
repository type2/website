&gt; I have a baywindow 6' industrial (no wood) rack from a '74 and it fits on my

&gt; The only downside is that there is not a whole lot of clearance between the
&gt; roof and rack ~1&quot; in the middle.

That is the same as the fit on the baywindow.

&gt; The rack is rated for 220lbs (from sticker on it and VW owners manual).
&gt; Also it had a manufacturing code of &quot;B1&quot; which I have no idea what means.

My full-length rack has the same manufacturer and weight limitation.

&gt; Basically if you run across a deal on a bay rack go for it!

Dang, now the price of bay racks just doubled!  :)
