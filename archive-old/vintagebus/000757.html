Subject: [VB] Modern 12 volt fuel gauge for late bus tank
Message-ID: &lt;0.e4c07802.2558470e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

is there a modern 12 volt VDO gauge that will work with a late bus tank

or will the round Karmann Ghia one work ?

The double door panel, soon to be &quot;Furniture-mobile&quot; does not have any gas 
gauge so I want to mount one under the dash and not cut a hole.
And the larger tank (68up) is already 12 volt

any ideas, it needs to be accurate.......thanks for your help
