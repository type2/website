&gt; 	If you feel uncomfortable stopping for someone who appears to be broken
&gt; down or in need of assistance, then please, please, drive down to the
&gt; next exit or wherever and call the highway patrol or police, to let them
&gt; know the location and desciption of the stranded vehicle and that they
&gt; might need help. The officer can call for a wrecker or an ambulance or
&gt; whatever the driver needs.

You might at least ask them first if they have a number they want called or 
whether they want the police involved.  Some people might NOT appreciate 
having the police notified.  For every bus they help, I'm sure there's a lot more 
that are search/hassled.  Even with no contraband, I'd prefer to give a passing 
stranger a number of a friend to call, rather than have them &quot;helpfully&quot; call the 
police for me.
