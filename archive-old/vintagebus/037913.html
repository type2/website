heh, hell if i would ever want to make finished products except for myself.
I have 2 business' allready and a fulltime job, no need for another
headache.  Blueprints were all i were interested in.  The only thing the
cabinet shop was gonna help me with was standardized tech drawings.  I'm no
draftsman.  As for the comment below...  well, if they were still around i
wouldnt have the question would i?

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Uhhhh, I belive several groups of folk tried it already, about 35 years
ago.  I believe they called themselves, Sundial, EZ and Riviera.
