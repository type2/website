when i picked up my 62crew.  it was all stripped to be sandblasted, no 
suspension nothing.
i asked the seller to measure for me the frame dimensions and i made a angle 
iron dolly wide enough to fit my trailer and 4x4s screwed to it  high enough 
to suport the frame.

when i got there we slid the dolly under . centered the wieght and strapped 
it to the dolly(4 big 3&quot; ratchet straps).

i hookedmy winch to the dolly and let it pull it up onto the trailer.
its still on that dolly in the garage, makes moving and working on it a snap.
and no more problems when you have to do emergency work on another car ,just 
push it to the side, and then move it back.
