hi all,
spent all day today  with my gas heater and my friend zeke. we finally got
it working. it's an eberspacher BN4 12v. i picked it up for $80 at a show
last month. we looked at everything. the fuel jet, spark plug, glow plug,
fuel pump, fuel pressure regulator (?), wiring. it turns out all it was was
a bad connection at the spark plug. it works great now! i learned a lot
about the things. we rewarded ourselfves by taking a nice, warm drive to the
gas station in it. the next step is rigging up a remote control so i can
turn it on from inside!
