Subject: Oil pressure sending unit question......

Hello all,

I'm just putting the final touches on my 66 standard for a nice relaxing
coast to coast journey. (with a stop at busses by the arch of course), and
the only problem I'm having is getting my new oil pressure sending unit to
work correctly. A gauge was installed by some PO, but the engine that is in
there now, only has the idiot light sender unit. I got the 80 pi with
warning light  sender from rmmw and installed it ...... The package the
sender came in was opened and included no directions ....... The unit itself
has 2 screw on connectors, one labeled G, and the other WK. I've tried all
possible connections from the idiot light and gauge, the gauge always sits
at zero and the idiot light won't go off........ So I want to get this one
working or put the other one back in before I go anywhere ......... any
ideas on how to hook this thing up??

Thanks......

Tim

Leaving from Northford CT on Tues morning......
Laptop and cell phone in hand......


Sorry if this got through twice ..... somehow I got removed from the list in
the last day or so......
