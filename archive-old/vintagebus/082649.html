Subject: Re: [T2] 78 engine acting strange  

have just started trouble shooting but some hints might shorten the head
scratching time
78 auto tranny mostly stock and running nicely. but in past two weeks
.  low power on acceleration
.  runs a bit rough at low rpm
.  hard starting
.  real hard starting (floods easily) when cool and damp
.  cruises at 60-65 mph and sounds normal.

first thought was one cyl wasn't firing but when I pulled wires all 4 were
helping out.

checked valves (hyd) they seem to be where I set em.
no points, pertronix
fuel filter is not that old, but plan on sticking a new one in
will probably put on new dist cap

pulled 3 plugs and they looked text book clean.  4th plug same age is
&quot;stuck&quot; and really have been reluctant to force it but that cyl (#1) seems
to be running fine.

have checked all electrical connections and vacuum lines..??

unfortunately gotta drive it tommorrow (my daily driver) it is full of
stuff I have to deliver (triple A is paid up)

thanks
Bob
