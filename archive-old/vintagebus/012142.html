Subject: re:tent mystery - what do I have
Mime-Version: 1.0

When I got my '65 bus recenlty it came with what the PO claimed was the original tent, 33 years old, which was still in the original sealed package, until the beginning of this year. The poles were a bit odd, and I tried setting them up to no avail. I figured I was missing some poles. I left them in Boston, my home town. Now in Houston I discovered a Web site that had some photos from VW literature on it(I don't remember where this was). Anyway, the poles actually attached to the front and rear bumper(they have little holes on the top on the passenger side for this purpose). Now I am in Houston without the ability to test out my tent system.

Back to your question, it sounds like your tent parts are similar, mine has a top piece, and then a curtain like piece which I think goes around the tent frame like a shower curtain.

I think your piece # 2 is probably the top, and 1&amp;3 are the sides. Does the camper have two brackets on the top of the bus?
