Hold on there, cowboy!  :)  I didn't *stall* the '60, it stalled itself!
&lt;grin&gt;

I think it was a combo of brakelights, turn signal, and engine electricl draw
coupled with no battery to take up the slack.  As soon as I pushed in the
clutch, it
was done.  I was still rolling, even.  So I let the clutch back out, but of
course,
with no battery, there is no source of spark for ignition, so I ground
pitifully to
a halt in the middle of the intersection.  So I'm sitting there at a busy
4-way stop
in a bright yellow bus loaded with VW parts, a 9-year-old kid, and no
battery.   So
I hop out and *push* this beast out of the intersection.  Guess what?  That
thing
weighs a lot more than a bug!

Anyway, the '55 SC was definitely a cool score. 3-piece doglegs and
everything!
