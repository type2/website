A couple things:

Don't use *sand* to blast; use an alternative media like walnut shells,
plastic, or garnet.  Using sand is what causes silicosis.  You still need
good ventilation, but not using sanf helps immensely.

You *can* blast without warping panels.  You just have to be very cautious,
and work gingerly.

Since this is a one-shot deal, don't worry about trying to recycle the
media.  By the time you get it filtered and cleaned up, what's your time
worth?

I blasted a lot on the '54, and have also done smaller projects like a KG
convertible, a datsun roadster, and lotsa wheels and small parts.  I have
yet to warp a panel.
