&gt;What you might want to do is to put a resistor before the wiper switch, and
at the
&gt;same time wire the clock to this resistor.  This way you should be able to
&gt;two jobs with resistor.  We have run the 6 volt clocks on 12 volts&gt;


I thought we just got done discussing this about 2 weeks ago where someone
told me this wouldn't work?
