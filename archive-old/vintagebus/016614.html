Me personally, I define &quot;husbandry&quot; more narrowly than that, based on the 
stories my dad and uncle told of animal husbandry classes at Fresno state.  
There are other vehicle code sections which state &quot;farm equipment&quot; or 
&quot;farm implement&quot;.  Since husbandy was explicitly stated so I have no choice 
other than to define &quot;implement of husbandry&quot; as &quot;shaggin' wagen&quot;,  however,
referring to my previous clarification, I have to add that it probably
includes farm animals.  The term implement would apply to a driven or towed 
vehicle, so a trailer could qualify as a shagenwagen, ie an eriba puck

I bet *that* would get you kicked out of the classic!
