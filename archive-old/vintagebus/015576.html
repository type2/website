DO NOT REPLY TO ME! (I say that every time, and every time I get some
dorkus maximus emailing me with &quot;will you trade a super beetle for it?&quot;

super straight, very low rust '59 &gt; single $1100 obo.  I have 3 old single 
cabs, and this is the newest of them, and the only one I'm not attached to.
It's in the Seattle/Tacoma area, 
Original tranny-probably needs rebuild, but I don't know..
No engine in it, but if someone really wanted an engine, I've got plenty of
them that need a little work
here or there, and I could work a deal.
Gates are in awesome shape,
Luggage area is in awesome shape,
The only thing that really pisses me off about a previous owner, is that he
cut some of the radio grills,
Needs a section on the drivers foot area welded in,
Didn't come with bumpers,
but an extremely straight vehichle, and pretty easy to restore.
