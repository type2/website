Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

I  don't know if anyone made 40hp at work stickers, but what I quoted is what 
Eric spray painted  large  on the back of his&amp;Barb's 60 camper (when they had 
a 40hp in it)  

the hazard triangle sounds good to me too- think I'll use that idea next time 
I take the 53 on the freeway.

&gt;  Someone used to sell these stickers and I cannot remember who...  Does
&gt;  anyone know who still makes these?
&gt;  
&gt;  I think a few others were &quot;Too slow?  Too bad!&quot; and &quot;Never get behind an 
old
&gt;  VW&quot;.
&gt;  
&gt;  Those are a little tacky for me, but I like the 40HP idea and the 
previously
&gt;  mentioned hazard triangle.
