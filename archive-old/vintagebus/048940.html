Sorry about the strange subject line.  The following description might be weird as well and hard to picture, but here goes.

If your like me and use a car cover on your pickup during rain, you've probably experienced the same problem that I have.  When it rains, the cover over the bed of the truck fills up with water forming a small lake or large pond rather quickly.  I tried stacking boxes in the bed to create a &quot;mound&quot; effect to help steer the water over the sides.  But that's a hassle, doesn't work that well, and what do you do with all of the large boxes when it's not raining. ?

I came up with a pretty cool solution over the weekend.  I took 1 1/2&quot; straps of 18 gauge sheetmetal, I think 8' long, which are standard lengths for sheetmetal.  I made a small ½&quot; , 90 degree bend at each end.  This bend is for the strap to fit under the side gates.  I then made a small bend the opposite way, 16&quot; from the end, approx. 40 degrees.  I did this at both ends of the strap also.  So here's the picture:  The strap pops under both side gates, runs straight up the gate to the top, and then a nice gradual arc over the bed and down the other side the same way.  Since the sheetmatal is thin enough, the arc is formed by itself, caused from the tension on the two sides.  Yet it's also sturdy enough to hold up the weight of the car cover.  I made 5 straps (ribs) for the Single Cab and 3 for the Double Cab.  I took it one step further and spot welded small 3 small channels on the two outer ribs and the center rib.  These are to hold 3 spines that are slid into the channels on the &quot;ribs&quot;.  It's awesome.  I'm going to dip the ends in the plastic crap that I use for the cupholders to keep from sratching the paint.

I can literally set the whole thing up in under 2 mintues, and when I take it down the ribs all fit together and are held togther by 2 velcro straps, and can just lie in the bed until next time.

If anyone is interested I can send you the exact dimensions.  It's pretty easy to make.  I fortunately have access to sheetmetal brakes and shearing equipment so it was really simple for me to make, but isn't mandatory.

Robert
