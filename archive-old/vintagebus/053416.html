Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] engine starter

Try pulling a bell housing from a bay in a junk yard. They go for ~$20 =
around here. I bolted one to a 1,000 lb. capacity Harbor Freight engine =
stand for a nice sturdy stand. You can also cut off the corner to just =
hold the starter. Want me to grab one for you, Chuck?

BTW, the guy who makes/sells the starter kit makes a nice engine roll-aroun=
d 'cart' and a well made oil cooler pressure test rig.=20
