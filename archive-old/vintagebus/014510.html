Hi Everret,
As promised here is the info on the recent book on buses from England that
shows the Bastard 40HP engine with it's aircleaner.  VW Bus by Malcolm
Bobbitt, ISBN 1 874105 74 X.  The factory drawing is on page 108 though he
just calls it &quot;The heart of the transporter: the Beetle-derived boxer
engine.&quot;.

 &lt;&lt; I found your tone toward a fellow listee demeaning. &gt;&gt;
sorry to hear you feel that way we were only trying to find out more
information on this air cleaner and thought we have kept the dialog civil.
If you want to Email us the part you found demeaning we would be happy to
disscuss it with you.
Eric&amp;Barb
