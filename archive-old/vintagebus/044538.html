&lt;&lt; Wix filters huh? I'll give it a try. I've got the bellows in place. I'll 
check the tubing.  Thanks &gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
You are welcome!  The Wix filters have not let us down so far, but be sure 
you tighten each filter as per thier directions and apply a dab of oil to the 
surface of the filter seal to allow it to seat itself properly when 
tightening.
    Check that the flaps are opening and closing correctly.  We have found 
that the curved arm on the rightside flaps that the rod to the thermostat 
bellows goes to is all too often bent up and does not allow the flaps to open 
completely.  It would not be impossible to have this arm bent downward too 
far which would not allow the flaps to close completely.  
    Do you have a oil pressure gauge?  If not get one.  We have saved at 
least three engines so far with this gauge.  About four years ago we got our 
SP SR 1641cc engine from one of the few engine rebuild shops we trust.  The 
oil pressure in this engine was a bit high so we tried replacing the rear oil 
relief valve.  One of the replacement springs we had around suddenly shot the 
oil pressure way up to where it never would go below 60 Lbs. in 70+F weather. 
 Way too close to the 80Lbs. limit.  Fortunitly it turned out with the proper 
pair of front and rear oil pressure relief springs we were able to get the 
oil pressure down to factory specs.  If your rear pressure spring is too 
strong it could be all the oil is being cooled too much because most of it is 
being sent to the oil cooler.
   The wieght of oil is also important.  We tried 20/50 Castrol in our DR 
engine and found it held pressure in it in temps below 50F more like plain 40 
or 50 Wt. oil.  for some reason this same oil in our SR engine while it still 
runs higher pressure does not run so mind boggling high as the DR engine.  
Because of this we are using up the 20/50 Wt. Castrol in our SR engine and 
when it is gone will go back to the 30 Wt..
    In cold weather it is a good idea to keep the engine in lower RPMs for at 
least the first block or two so as to allow the engine to warm up and keep 
the oil pressure at the pressure sender below 80Lbs..  For us with our 
freeway flier geared tranny it seems to be about 5-10 MPH in first gear.
