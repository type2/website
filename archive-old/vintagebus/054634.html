Subject: RE: [VB] EMPI rear stabilizer bar

Hi Chris,

The donut that goes between the bar and the plate that connects to the trans
should be easy to find a replacement.  The piece that goes between the end
of the bar and the axle tube I don't thing is easily found.  Most people I
have met get a flat piece of some form of rubber and make one.  I'll try and
post a picture today or tomorrow.  I have several compensators in my garage
but only about 3 of those little pads... I believe I have a lead on someone
that can make them.

David

Subject: [VB] EMPI rear stabilizer bar


My '67 DC has an original dealer-installed EMPI rear stabilizer bar in
need of some repair.  34 years of oil leaks have disintegrated what
appears to be a rubber piece that connected the bracket attached to the
engine to the bar attached to the axles.  Does anyone know if a suitable
replacement part is available?  Or have one for sale?
