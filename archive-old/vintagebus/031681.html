Subject: 14&quot; verses 15&quot; wheels

Just a weird thing that happened to me today. I went out to my junk piles of
wheels to find some 14 inch wheels, no problem I thought, I should have
stacks of them. After digging through all my wheels I came up with 1, 14&quot;
inch wheel, but found at least 3 complete sets of 15&quot; wheels, looks like
I'll have to start collecting 14 inch wheels again!
