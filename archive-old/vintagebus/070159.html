Subject: Re: [VB] Molded windshield seals

Hehe!

This is funny - the NOS windshield seal that Ronnie sent out on this saga
spent over 20 years riding in my bus as a spare part under the driver
seat - I had bought it at a VW dealer back in 78 in Norman, OK when I
lived there, never used it, and sold it to Ronnie 2 years ago for this
purpose. Still had the VW paper tag on it! Looks like we'll all benefit
from my hauling it around for over 20 years - like a time machine, or a
time capsule!

&gt; They are being air frieghted over and should have them in stock in the next
&gt; 2 weeks.
&gt;     These will be for sale once I have test fit them to make sure they are
&gt; correct. For those of you following this saga, it started over 2 years ago
&gt; with me sending NOS winshield seals to be copied and then made.
