I have the 40% part which you can have for the cost of shipping from
Hood, CA 95639. But if you happened to have a bus-specific heat
exchanger, preferably drivers side, with the extra fitting for the
oilbath aircleaner preheated air intake, then I would like to trade
for that (found both on splitties and upright engine early bays.)

No hurry deciding, this piece of vintage junk won't be hitting ebay
anytime soon.

Good luck,
Joel
