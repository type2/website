Subject: Re: [VB] Wasserboxer conversion versus after market type 1
  aluminum case versus 

&gt;the Waserboxer converted to the air cooled is
in September 8 2002 postings in the Vanagon Archives.&lt;

Hey Stan, I could not find it in the archives... Is that the right date? 
Thanks for your help.

&gt;My thought is that the people making
the initial conversions are probably machinists and did stud-insert
relocating more because they could than because it was really required&lt;

I agree with that George.  I think it is possible, just depends on how much 
work is envolved.

Here is a good picture:

Note that these are 14mm inserts instead of the stock 10mm so the holes are 
bored out for the eccentric bolts.

Still more to come...

Adrian
