Subject: [VB] reverse gear gremlin
Date: Thu, 4 Jan 2001 17:13:36 -0500

I have a 67 splitty that has a gremlin in reverse. Sometimes it works and
sometimes it does'nt. What is strange about it is that when it works,
everything seems to work fine. Good engagement and no sign of slippage. When
it does'nt, it seems that everything is working, ie., shifter and such feels
normal, but theres no go. It acts as if it is not in gear. All forward gears
work fine. Is it possible that the shift fork or the reverse gear is
slipping?

Thanks, John
