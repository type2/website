Subject: RE: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

But I'm not doing it to claim that it is the og motor... I'd always state it
was restamped.  I'm not ashamed!  Maybe I could stamp the 'H' upside down
;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'm tempted to stamp the case with the original serial number and
a few people have told me this is highly illegal(!)
&gt;
I don't see why it would be illegal.  Immoral, yes, if you were to sell
the vehicle and claim it was the &quot;original engine&quot;.

Legal... illegal... morality... these are all frames of mind.
