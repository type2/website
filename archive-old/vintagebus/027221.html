Subject: Clutch problems solved!

Hello listees!

    Last week I asked about a clutch problem I was having.  Well on
Saturday I pulled the engine and solved the problem.
    I had an old 9 spring pressure plate, the collar has three little
tabs on the back side that fit into the 3 arms.  Two of the tabs had
broken off, causing the collar to be crooked.  Nothing else looked or
felt broken.  So one new pressure plate later and I'm back on the road.
I also put two washers on my bowden tube and it has a good bend in it
now.
    Thanks to all for your input.
Jon 65 standard on the road again
