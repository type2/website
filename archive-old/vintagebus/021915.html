Subject: [VB] Cutting divider

Hi,

I am curious. What happens if you cut the divider. Do you lose structural
integrity? Walkthrough's don't have the divider and that is stock. Is there
something special about walkthrough's? I am mostly curious and it may be the
only way a bus will get salvaged. I am considering making a panel into a
camper with swivel vanagon seats.

Please no sermon's about how wrong it is to modify etc...
