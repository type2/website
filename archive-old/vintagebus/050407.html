&lt;&lt; Has anybody ever tried fitting empi 5's on a pre '63 bus?  I am
 encountering problems trying to fit the above wheels onto the front of my 
van. The drum is to wide and will not allow the wheel to fit snugly onto it. 
Has anyone tried grinding down the drum? &gt;&gt;

Been there, done that.  You have to swap out your drums for the later style.  
But you get bigger brakes at the same time so though it will cost you some 
moola it is an upgrade that is well worth it.
