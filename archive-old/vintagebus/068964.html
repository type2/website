Subject: re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

I'll be doing a re-install tonight (again).  The races
are always replaced, but I'm going to take a lot of
care doing it this time. 

I'll get my SO to watch me like a hawk (after all,
she's the one that wants to drive to Florida with it
again, for the 6th time) on Friday.

I really like the tip about using an old race ground
down to use as a guide.  I'm definitely going to try
that.

The front beam is actually from a '68, and it has that
funky nut with an alan key to tighten it down.  Nice
to work with, but I've noticed that the nut may have
hit the inside of the (dented) cap, possbily causing
metal shavings.  If anyone has one of these nuts, I'd
appreciate knowing which side should be toward the
washer, and which side toward the outside.  This time
around I'm going to have the 'larger' side outward.

I don't know if I'll get a chance to road test it
tonight as its going down to the usual (this year
anyway) -16C. 

Thanks for all the tips, wish me luck.  I don't want
to replacing bearings every 4 hours on a 36 hour
drive...
...Markus
