Hey NQ,

Don't despair. Once it is right it will last a long time. You are
almost there.

I agree, I spend most of my driving time at cruise, so that is where I
want my power.

&gt; &gt;Why pull the engine to remove the springs?Pressurize the cylinder
with shop
&gt; &gt;air and remove the springs and install the single springs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's got dual springs and my puller will not get in behind the
center
&gt; spring.  I'm going to try and modify my tool tonight to grab both
springs to
&gt; try and prevent having to yank the heads.
&gt;
&gt; This whole thing with my bus is absolutely not fun.  I've been told
to use
&gt; stock heads, large valve heads and I've been told to use neither.  I
can say
&gt; that with stock heads, my low end was there but at highway speeds
the engine
&gt; just fell off.  With these big valve heads, I've lost a little bit
of the
&gt; low end but once I put the pedal down at highway speeds, hold on!
If I had
&gt; smaller tires on it would pull even harder.  So I guess for those
that think
&gt; a large valve head on a 1776 isn't the way to go, I have to
disagree.  It
&gt; put the power where I wanted it - at cruise!
