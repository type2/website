&gt; SHUT UP!!!

Somebody missed their nap. People who choose 40 year old vehicles that are
notoriously underpowered, drafty, loud, cold in winter, hot in summer, etc.
as their daily drivers may tend to not to be followers of fads like the
latest must have car or so forth. And folks that collect them for occasional
use or as a casual hobby may tend more towards that mindset, who knows? I
have heard nobody from the daily driver camp suggesting that you shouldn't
own one, or that they shouldn't be produced, only the simple fact that it is
ugly. And to my eye it is all of that. I would be embarrased to be seen in
one but I don't require that you must also be. I don't care it you have a
Gnu Beetle, go ahead. It's your money, but to suggest that because I haven't
bought my wife one I bitch about what new things cost is ridiculous. My wife
drives a vette and they cost more than 2 freaking Gnu Beetles. Jesus Christ
a set of tires for the pile of $hi+ costs $2000.00 and it is on the third
set in only 27000 miles. Go price a shock absorber at the dealer, it is $800
for one and that is not a misprint. Cheap my ass. And I'll bitch about the
gummit all I like, thank you.

I have been messing with split buses for over 20 years. They all look the
same and it is a look that I like. I don't like bugs, Ghias, 411's, 412's,
Things or bay windows. Used to own a Fastback, painfully ugly car but fun to
drive. I haven't given anything that VW has produced since '67 more than a
passing glance, and couldn't begin to tell you what models they make or have
made. If this means that I am not allowed to voice an opinion about a
concept vehicle, I won't lose much sleep over it, but maybe you should write
out what the rules are so we all can know ahead of time. That way we could
avoid offending your sensibilities with our worthless opinions. I know I
would do my part, I am noted for being the sensitive Alan Alda type.
