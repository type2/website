Subject: Re OCTO--A No for Me - Bummer!!

To All of you guys that Can go to OCTO--You are really lucky!--I'm in Phoenix with 4 weeks
down and two more to go in a &quot;walker&quot; due to a right hip replacement!! I know if i could
make the trip i would be there faster than a drop of water disappears on a black top road
in AridZona--But the best part is Magoo--who must be the Best VW Wife in the World--Magoo
Will be driving out to do the VW Toy Show by herself!!! What a woman!!! If any of you
single BusVolk ever get married and have a VW Wife half as good as Magoo --You will be in
Heaven!! To complete my &quot;sentence&quot; in this walker was the fact that one day Before i went
in for surgery my New Old VW truck came into my garage--A nice 1960DC--And only through
some dear friends who live in &quot;The Shores of Phoenix&quot; have i been able to get things in
shape, so i can drive the DC--As of now i cannot even get Into my beloved VW Buses--!!Even
after two more weeks i Still may not be able to drive!! Magoo and my VW Friends have
detailed the headlight buckets--replaced door rubber--one windshield--installed the wood
slats--rear shocks--adjusted valves and timed the motor--we still need to replace the
rubber in the back window and replace the front shocks--Bless all my friends that came
through so far--Brad--David--another David--and Steve--Steve will even stay with me when
Magoo is on her way to the VW Toy Show and back--again Solo!!
Next i guess i will have to read on this list about all the &quot;Scores&quot; many of you will
find--That's Life--
I guess this old man cannot be everywhere--But if any of you can make that OCTO run---Do
It!!
Its a Vantastic show as well as Das Klassic--Happy hunting to all of you--And may your
trip be fruitful and Safe!! &quot;Keep them Splittie Rollin&quot;   TWWM, uj
