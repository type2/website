Subject: etc etc

Called a few people from the website list.  A few numbers were disconnected -
answering machines - changed numbers etc .. finally found one person.  He does
much of the work himself, but uses my mechanic number 2 and is very happy with
his work - his shop etc .. He knew of and had in fact spoke to my mechanic
number 1 and said that he is a VERY GOOD WELDER ..and it is a VERY GOOD
machine shop, but doesn't use him for repairs.  BUT .. I mentioned my
disappointment with my bus now being &quot;crippled&quot; and the brace underneath ..
and he says he has one on his bus, and called it a mustache bar.  So on that
topic, he did not feel my pain.  Maybe if I water my money tree this week real
well, I can take my bus to Mechanic number two and get a good going over ..
like a healthy checkup you get annually at the doctors office .. See from him
what is important that gets fixed .. the steering adjustment .. the clutch and
brake adjustment .. are MAYBE something's that I can do myself .. Maybe I can
even hook up the gas gauge myself .. YEAH .. I bet I can do that !!

Now maybe I should give this list a rest for a while .. you gotta be sick of
hearing my problems.
