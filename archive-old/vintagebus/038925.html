Importance: Normal

I found a 1776, for a good price. Builder claims it's align bored with Mahle
pistons, rebuilt heads, new push rod tubes, 009 new, gen stand, cooler, 12.5
lb flywheel, engle 110 cam... I would want to run a stock exhuast and single
carb, probably my new pict 34. Is it posisble to get that combination to
function? I would rather not ditch a stock exhuast, and single carb
simplicity. If the answer is get a stock 1500 or 1600 then, I can live with
that.
