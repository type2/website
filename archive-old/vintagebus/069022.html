&lt;&lt; Many thanks to those who've chipped in with tips and advice so far.  Let's
 see:
 
 FRAME: Cleaned tons of crud off the frame horns and crossmember.  That stuff 
sure
 preserves the original paint.
 ................
amazing, huh!
...............
 
 AXLES 1: I don't have the side gears out yet.  They seem to catch on
 something, not just drop out, but haven't looked really closely yet.  Axle
 paddles looked nice.  Some minor dings on the fulcrum plates.  Can't one
 put them in the other way around so the wear from forward motion impinges
 on the less worn portion?  My feeling is these parts are OK, but I'll
 re-read Clara's note and check the gap between fulcrum &amp; paddle per
 Bentley. 
...............
uh oh, this is the dreaded side gears wont fall out of the tranny even though 
you removed the circlip and spacer deal?????   Well, somehow you need to get 
one out, then you can use a drift to tap the second out.   The pounding in 
tranny sometimes makes ggrooves in the sides of teh 'tunnel' the side plates 
go in.   Those side gears should slide out w/o binding.
Use a straight edge on teh FP/paddles to check wear.
/////////////////////////////
 
 AXLES 2: New side cover shims/gaskets on the parts list.  Bentley says in
 67 they went to a big O-ring.  Now, am I gonna have a problem putting my
 '65 side covers on a rebuilt '67-style tranny because of this??  And I
 assume unless I separate the axle tubes from the RBG inner housing, I have
 to use split boots?
...................
I've mixed and matched and it seems to work.
you can use unsplit boots itf you have the tubes off.   Warm up the boots 
enough to get them flexible, and you acn get stretch them over the sprayed 
bit at the inner end.  
 That's how I did it, at least.  Gotta be easier than taking the boxes off 
the tubes.
.......///////////////////////////////////////
 RGB BEARINGS 2: I am daunted by the process for rebuilding these even
 after (or maybe because of) reading Bentley and Dave Easterwood's article. 
 Especially that cover plate on the back.  And I see I will have to
 disassemble at least the passenger-side one to get the bad upper inner
 bearing out. Bentley says use a *new* nut on the inner end of stub axle
 when replacing?  Who gots dem?
 .....................
I hunted for them when I did boxes the last time, and no one had them.  They 
swap the nuts from side to side and use locktite.  At least the tranny 
builders I called all said that.    
//////////////////////////////////////////////
 
 And mulling over whether it will emasculate me to get the machine shop to
 replace them.  They have an old VW hand on board - I'm gonna call them and
 get a feel for it tomorrow.
 ..................
Always good to talk to someone who has done it.  If possible, get them to 
come over and walk you through it.
//////////////////////////////
 Thanks for listening.  Last night I was scraping crud off the tranny after
 10pm when a Beetle pulls up in my driveway; guy I'd never met just stops
 to schmooze on VWs, said he'd seen my buses &amp; owns a 67 westy I've noticed
 around town.  All kinda wackos come out of the woodwork.... ;-)

 My bus is a wheelbarrow!
