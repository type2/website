&gt; Have you checked it with 180 pounds in the driver's seat?  That tends to

Sorry, I can't lose the 70lbs fast enough for the experiment to be viable..

&gt; When you measured the angle of the rear trailing arms, did you lift them
&gt; up to take the play out of the splines?  If you didn't, they could be set
&gt; a degree or two low.

No; I did have them firm in the housing though.

&gt; Is this a late beam transplant?  IIRC, those ride a bit high in the front.

Looks like the original beam to me - doesn't look like it's ever
been out of the bus.


Whatg vexes me is the bus looks low, but has *positive* camber, 
meaning the hweels point *out* at the top.  If I raised it more, they
would point out more.  My 60DD has just a smidge of positive camber.
