Don't most good wiring harnesses come with instructions anyways?  Or is this just
instructions on where to route the wires...and not a diagram?  I am in the market
for a new harness and I think (fingers crossed) I'm getting some Bus Depot gift
certificates for x-mas....so that'll be a wiring harness and/or seals.

Has anyone ever used a wiring harness for a split from BusDepot?  Ron...who makes
yours? for the early buses that is.
I've heard good things about wireworks... but kinda pricy.  I realize this isn't
the thing to go real cheap on as it is a real PITA to have to lengthen wires on a
NEW harness.  Ron is by no means cheap (I mean that with respects to quality) as he
offers great products and great prices, but I'm just curious if anyone has used one
from Bus Depot.

thanks all!
