&gt; Has anyone had any remarkable experiences with selling a VW on the internet?  I've posted ads on some of the free VW classifieds but havn't had much luck.  What else should I try?
&gt;
You didn't even say what you were selling!

Doh!

You could sen me some photos for a &quot;Photo Ad&quot; on my site...
