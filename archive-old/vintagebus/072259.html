&gt; I am wondering if I can get the relevant bits apart without taking the 
&gt; brake plate off (i mean without removing the 4 bolts around the spindle that Muir 
&gt; says to take out, just kind of letting the whole brake assembly hang off the 
&gt; tie rod instead).

Hi Diana,
Yes, you can, but do not let it hang from the flex brake line.  You might 
need to slide a cinder block under the spindle/brake drum assembly.  Loosen the 
lug bolts on that wheel, jack up and install a jack stand then, take off the 
wheel first!  Then proceed getting into there and adjusting the link pin shims.

  I'm also not sure of the torque specs (if there are any) for the bolts 
holding the &gt; king and link pin assembly in place.  Forgive me if I'm getting the 
&gt; names wrong, I'm not too good with terminology.  No I do not have a bentley 
&gt; manual.  If this is too difficult to explain in email, does anyone know if a 
&gt; regular alignment shop would be able to do this?
&gt; 

Best you do this yourself!  Plus it really is not that hard to do, but YES 
you really need to the the Bentley reprint of the VW shop manual for 1963-67 
bus.
