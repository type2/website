Subject: Camping:  Saturday after Red Barn

Hi Folks!

I am asking for information/interest regarding camping on Saturday night
after Red Barn (the 21st) near New Brighton State Beach, if possible.  It
would seem that New Brighton is all fulled up, and it would be groovy to be
able to stick with other bussers that night....I'd love to join the caravan
to New Brighton, and then camp somewhere nearby.  I'll be looking through my
campbooks tomorrow morning to see if there any spots that might work and are
available, and if there's interest, maybe we can work something out!

FWIW, I'm currently attempting to coerce Aaron Boice and tribe, and Brian
Peircy to attend the bus events that weekend in their busses.  The more the
merrier, right?

Later,

Gene
