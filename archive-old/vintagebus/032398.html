Subject: WTB (or fab): Single cab spare tire carrier
Mime-Version: 1.0

Subject line pretty much says it all.  The painting post earlier got me 
thinking that it would be nice it my spare weren't lying on the floor of 
the treasure chest.  Alternately, ideas on how I could fabricate one would 
be nice, too.  I have the wingnut and bracket but have no idea what the 
original carrier even looks like...
