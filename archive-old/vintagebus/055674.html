Subject: New.... Good book

I recently ran into a good book for cheap.  Unfortunately it is about bugs,
but it is written by Keith Seume.  The book's title is &quot;The Beetle&quot;.  It is
a very small book about 4 inches long by 3 inches high and 1.5 inches
high.  The photography is some of the best studio quality I've seen.  Lots
of close ups and statistics info along with the great photos are packed in
this small book.  It covers proto type NSU-01 new beetles.  Very complete
for such a small book..  There are 12 pages of text and pictures of a 55
deluxe BD.  Very nice.  Too bad that's all the bus coverage :-(  Hopefully
an all bus book is on the way.

Best part....it was only $5 bucks!  I found it at Costco here in Orange
county CA.

Steve
