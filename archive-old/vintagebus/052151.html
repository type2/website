&gt; Bart,
&gt;   Because busses should not sit for long periods and
&gt; since I am a kind hearted soul, always giving - I
&gt; volunteer to drive your Sundial while it awaits your
&gt; return. Understand that I am just looking out for your
&gt; bus' best interest (besides, my wife would rather camp
&gt; at BBB6 in a sundial than in a double cab)!

&gt; Hey Listees!
&gt;     Bart Daugherty here and I am gonna be stuck here in
&gt; Fort Wayne, IN for
&gt; awhile.  Staying at a corp. apt. for now, but have to
&gt; find a house this
&gt; week.  My sundial is being stored in Fresno till the
&gt; salt is gone or I may
&gt; just leave it there and fly out for the shows.  Any VW
&gt; ppl here in Fort
&gt; Wayne????  I have  seen a few beetles and a couple of
&gt; rusted out bays, no
&gt; splits though :(  Well have fun in Havasu, gonna be in
&gt; Nashville that
&gt; weekend.  My wife wanted me to sell my bus?  You believe
&gt; that?  Anyway after
&gt; a year or so I think I can make it to the west coast,
&gt; this is one of those
&gt; career building moves.  Gonna miss all of you.
