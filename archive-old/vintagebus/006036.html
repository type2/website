&gt; Well, I found a set of singlecab gates.
&gt; Complete with latches, hardware.
&gt; They are pretty straight, some dents. Sides appear to be a little bit
bowed
&gt; out.
&gt; Not bad though.
&gt; Better than 75% of the ones I see floating around for sale.
&gt; The seller wants 750$ bucks though, is this a going price?

Going price? Who knows? I paid $200 for one good side gate for my double-cab
about 8 years ago. I felt lucky to have found one (this was before I found
this list). So I  would say it sounds perhaps a bit high, but then how badly
do you need them?
