Might want to mention the size of the ball you have now (for comparison)
and the p/n of the mirror...

Subject: [VB] round mirror question


   It was brought to my attention today that there are different size
ball ends on round mirrors with the change being made sometime in the
late 50's early sixties. I have gone through all of my OG round mirrors
and they all have the same diameter ball on the end of the stalk. So if
any of you have any NOS round mirrors or any on your barndoor etc, could
you check the ball size for me to end this question. 
  The part number on all of the mirrors, including the one with the
supposedly smaller ball are all the same.

ronnie      just wondering!
