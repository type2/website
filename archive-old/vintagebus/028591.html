Subject: license tags and main seal leakage

Hey all...
I put a new main seal in the other day and had my motor sitting out as I
don't have someone to help me lift it down onto the jack to stick it in
the bus.  I went out today and put the clutch back in and noticed a bit
of oil on the flywheel.  Not much...just a tad.  Maybe this is some left
over from before?? i thought I cleaned it all off.  So...off with the
flywheel again...and I cleaned it all up, inspected the seal, and all
was fine.  I hope that was the end of my problems.  If not...another
seal is on order...and I'll have to find why it is leaking...  Any
suggestions??

Another thing...
I have to get the 62 registered so I can start pickin up chicks in it
;-)
I'd like to get personalized plates... does anyone have any good
suggestions???  7 character limit...
so far I have...
SLOW 62
CHXDGIT (chicks dig it)
CHKMGNT (chick magnet)
TRKSBUS (turkis bus)
SPLIT62
SPLITTY
PASSME
JSTPSME (just pass me)

most are just for comical value.... email me your best suggestions and
I'll post what I get...  please do this via p-mail unless Mr. Thom says
its OK.  I think this is a Friday topic... email me or hold it till
Friday and think of some really good ones :)
