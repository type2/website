&gt; heck, just deposit the check and see if it clears,

The problem is that it _will_ clear if it is a good forgery.  Banks tend
to trust each other that way.  When the checks wends its way back to
France or wherever it will then bounce and your bank will suck the money
back from you.  If you have already withdrawn the money they will demand
that you pay them immediately or, if you're not lucky, simply send Officer
Friendly around to arrest you for check fraud.  After all, they have no
way to tell if you made the fake check or received it from someone else.
All they know is that you have their money and they want it back.

Best thing to do is to contact the authorities and tell them about your
situation _before_ you agree to anything with the scammer.  If the
authorities want you to play along, they will tell you how to do it in
order to get good evidence, as well as cover you from being accused
of fraud yourself.  They tend to dislike amateurs playing on their turf.
