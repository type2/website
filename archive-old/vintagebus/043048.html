Brad,

The red light 'on' is meant to indicate inadequate charging. Therefore,
anything in the charging chain can possibly contribute to the light going
on. 

This an include worn generator brushes, bad electrical connections from
generator to voltage regulator, bad (dirty - go in and clean them up)
contacts on the voltage regs internal relays, or bad electrical
connections from volt reg to battery. This all can include bad grounding
as well from volt reg to chassis, generator to chassis, you name it. Most
of the above are uncommon, so usually a dirty relay in the volt regulator
or bad connection from gen to volt reg. Sometimes worn brushes.
