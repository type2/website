Subject: Berg Pressure Relief Oil Pump Cover
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2000 12:13:28 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Friends:

Last week I installed a Gene Berg prussure relief oil pump cover on the 57. 
I had been worried about exploding my oil filter in this super cold weather 
when the oil pressure is very high.

It works great. Instead of my pressure gauge &quot;pegging&quot; when I leave the 
driveway in the morning, It now never gets above 65PSI. I recommend this to 
those with remote filters or coolers hooked up with a full flow set up.
