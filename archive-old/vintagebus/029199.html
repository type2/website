&gt;I wonder how many sales go unreported at little mom and pop stores where
they write your receipt on a generic pad they bought at the dime store.
&gt;
Actually, standard practice is to open the register without ringing the
sale up.  That way, they have a full record of legitimate sales in case
of an IRS audit.  The register is closed at the end of the day and the extra
is pocketed.

At a pizza place where I used to work, we only rang up the eat-in people.
 95% of the income was deliveries.

At a lunch place near where I used to work, they rang up about every 5th
person.

So let's get rid of paper money and let big brother track us.  ;)
