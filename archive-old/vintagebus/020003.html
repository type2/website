Since you are working with the same type of windows as I, have you come

Thanks much, Rocky

&gt;&gt; Hi. Please help! I only need need two sundial windows to complete my 
&gt;&gt; wife's
&gt;&gt; new 67 bus resto. If you dont already know, these windows have one 
&gt;&gt; pane that
&gt;&gt; cranks straight out and up with the division bar that goes from the 
&gt;&gt; top to
&gt;&gt; the bottom. Let me know if you have any. Will buy whole set if need be.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sam.
