Hi Meredith,
As always you are welcome.  We are going to install reserve switches in all 
of our buses that did not have this feature stock.  This way when we want to 
remove the engine, or replace all of the fuel lines, we just slid under the 
bus.  Flip the switch by hand to shut off the fuel flow from the tank!  Even 
with the reserve switch it is nice to just reach over the left side of the 
engine to remove the fuel line!   Eric&amp;Barb
