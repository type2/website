Hey all,

I know you are are really bored with hearing about my self absorbed trip that
seems to have lasted almost a month.   Yup, well Too Bad, because you are
forced to read my Sucky Trip Report.  There is no way out.  Your delete/ignore
button surely and surlily does not work.  You have no thumbs.

And of course, you don't want to hear about fixing a 40 year old VW Truck and
driving it about 900 miles in 2 days, anyway, as it's boring, and a waste of
time and energy for me to be doing it, when I should be doing something
better, and you too.  Get off your lard butt.

Anyway,  I left Cupertino Wed PM and went to visit my Mom, about 20 miles.
There was a wierd noise coming from the direction of the left front wheel.
I was vaguely worried.   Truck also seemed a slug, and handled funny.      I
determined that I had forgotten to put air in the tires, so I went to a gas
station where, to my pleased surprise, they did not charge for air.  (Remember
when air was free?  Back in the good old days...)   But I had to ask the gas
station attendant for  to borrow a pressure gauge.   They were all low, and I
filled the spare too.   For some reason the attendant asked my If I was
German,  ?  Well, the truck is.  It was a little funny getting to the air
filling place as it was a little tricky finding reverse in Truck, so I avoided
it and just waited, which irritated someone that I didn't back up (not that he
had asked, ) who yelled at me.   I smiled and waved.  What a self absorbed
jerk.

So at casa de mama I parked truck, and relaxed.  Long hot bath, ate dinner,
watched south park on tv.

Thursday Morning, after a good nights sleep, I looked under the front, and lo
and behold, Front Left Shock was not bolted on.   So I dug up a  17mm nut and
attached itm and duct taped the tubes to the heater boxes on.  The tubes were
the wrong (larger) diameter,  although the tubes on the bus and the heater
boxes matched.  Um- that's clear, right?  I turned the heat on as a indication
of engine temp (engine temp up, heat temp up, not scientific, but something).
Also got out a bucket of soapy water and did a bit of washing, the cab was
really dusty, and so was the dash.  Afterwards, from the speedo right the dash
looked a lovely dove blue, but the left  was not so hot as someone had cut a
guage hole, then welded it over, really badly, warping the dash, and leaving
a rusty bumpy spot of bad welds bleah.    Guess that's all,  Left the Bay Area
at about 11 am Thursday.    People drive faster there than where I live.   I
didn't drive over 55.      I putted along in the slow lane with no radio.
Around the bottom of the Bay (oh yes- the noise by the wheel was gone now).
Mr. Truck handled well, seemed to stop well, and just didn't miss a beat with
that 40 hp motor. 

I navigated the hazards of crazy drivers for a couple hours it seemed, and
stopped for gas in Fairfield, on I 80 east.     I was getting 24 mpg, not as
good as I hoped.   Then Truck wouldn't start.   The battery had been low, but
I would have thought all that driving would charge it.  I guess not.  (6V
BTW).    Eventually a kind couple helped me push start it, and I resolved not
to shut it off till I got to Redding.     

So on up through the Central Valley,  turned onto 505 to I 5 north.  Now I
found this farmland relaxing, after all the hustle and rush of the huge urban
area I left behind.   Sigh of relief.   Went through the Taco Bell drive
through, and headed up to Redding.   I was now settled in a groove.  Mr. Truck
was just bopping along, in the slow lane.   The engine was humming, and the
tranny gave a slight whine, not too much to worry about.   I played the
alphabet game, finding the letters on liscence plates, then on other places on
cars...   It was overcast to about when I got to 505, which kept the temp down
for a while, but it did get up to 90, which I find tiring.   But at least it's
not 100

Well, I got to Redding just about 6,  and Mr. Truck has electric gremlins, yes
sirreebob, o yea.    Staying at Steve's again, and pulled in and parked in the
shade, and the engine died when it got to idle.  SO I sat in a lawn chair in
the shade for a bit.   We looked for THE SHORT, but didn't find it.  Though
the wiring is not exactly stock, and it's really annoying, and needs to be
fixed.    The chage in the battery went down when the key was turned on or
when the starter button was pressed.  SO put it on charge and went to eat in
an extremely fast Ghia.

Next morning  (Friday) it started fine, after being on charge all night.
Charging system was giving about 7 Volts, as it should.  Maybe the battery is
funky.  Well, I had about 550 miles to go, so I went north.  

I stopped in Yreka and got a brake cable.  Those early ones are getting hard
to come by.  

And I found......   Mountains.    for many miles.  I cheerily downshifted to
3rd and went 35.     

I was thinking as people sped pass me at near light speed how I can't drive
65.     And at one place the left lane was closed, but it was their bad luck,
cause I'm driving a 40 year old slow truck.  

 You know those SLOW TRUCK signs, I felt like I should have one attached to my
taillgate.    

And I was happy that I didn't get pulled over for expired tabs, as they
expired a year ago.  Now before you chastise me, I did get a trip permit,
which for some reason goes in the lower right corner of the (singular?)
windsheild, according to the state of California.  Not a very visible spot,
and no doubt unknown to officers of Oregon and Washington state law
enforcement agencies.

So I climbed over the hills, oh, I got gas and coffee in Weed, and I was
getting 30mpg now, not bad, with the 15 gallon tank theorectically I could go
450 miles without stopping, at 55 miles an hour that's like forever.

So a lot of slow hills, sometimes driving the shoulder just to give people
more space, and stopped at a rest area in Oregon, about 80 miles in, The truck
didn't need to stop, but I did.     Motor was under boiling point of spit ,
and air temp was about 80, so I was doing good.   Started, which is good.
Kept expecting to see green grass, but all is brown in the fields, and dark
green trees,  cows sometimes.   Stopped in Cottage Grove for gas, and still
got 30mpg, nifty keeno.    I like this.        Guy had a VW shop across the
street, and came over to look at the truck, but I couldn't stop and chat, as I
wanted to be home by dark  in case the battery didn't like headlights.   He
liked Truck.    Thought it was neat that I switched it back to 6V.
Allright!!!  Everyone else thinks I'm a freak.

So within 50 miles or so of Portland, it starts getting cloudy, well actuall
the cloud layer, was, well, thick.    It actually rained lightly for a few
minutes, and I turned on the squeaky wipers.

Again, urban terrors, a video game in a low powered, low geared, ancient
vehicle.  I survive, and get bonus points, arriving in the Great State of
Washington, boring and relaxing.   Only 114 miles till I get home.   Oh, BTW,
the odometer read 6 miles off for every hundred miles driven.    If the
odometer read I went a hundred, I actually went about 94 miles.    The wheels
on it are 14&quot;, not the 15&quot; the speedo would be calibrated for.   SO I figure
instead of going 55mph, I'm going 52 mph.  YEEEE HAWWWWW!!!!!     I don't want
to go faster though, And I'm already probably going too fast.   Oregon has 307
miles of marked miles posts to judge by.

But it's getting darker.  Is it just the clouds?  No, it is also getting
later.    I turned the running lights on at mile marker 57, halfway through
Washington to my home.   Oh, did I mention in addition to more alphabet games,
I kept figuring out the fraction of milage traveled?   SIlly head games to
keep me from going stark raving mad.      I am worried, start gnashing my
teeth, which are worn down anyway, oh Jeez, I really need to get braces.
It's about 8 30 pm, I have been on the road for about 12 hours.   I hope my
cat is okay.    I will maintain, just about an hour to go.   Just before
Centralia/Chehalis I turn on the headlights, and figure I'll get home somehow
if the battery can't hack it.   I drive through Little Rock , and it is pretty
dark.   My headlights are not properly adjusted.   I drive by the lights other
people give off.   

I can see the lights in front of me in my rearview mirror, reflecting off the
back window of the cab.   It is sort of misleading.   Probably can be
considered dangerous.

 What do other people w/SCs do about that?

Eventually there is my exit, hm, with headlight badly ajusted I can't see too
well on the empty rural road.  I make it home, parking in my driveway, turn
off the lights and motor, and step out of truck.  I feel like mashed jello.
It is 10pm, and I have been driving most of the past 14 hours.   Time for a
cold beer.   

I passed zero (0) people on the entire trip, meaning not one single solitary
vehicle.  Nada .

I was yelled at by annoyed motorists twice, including the gas station guy,
stared at by children, and waved to by a number of cars, including a vanagon
which toot tooted at me (I toot tooted back).   I saw no splittys on the drive
north, though I had seen a  shiny teal and white 21 window in the bay area the
day before I left, chrome bumpers, not my style, but  the guy obviously loved
his bus and smiled and waved enthusiastically,   in the same headspace,
grooving on driving the old splitty.

That's all.  Trip is over.  

Clara
