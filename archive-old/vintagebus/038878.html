I guess the obvious answer is dig around at swap meets there are always one or
two, make sure you get a left and right. I got two lefts if someone has two
rights maybe we can trade

or do what I did and buy a new set from Rocky Mountain Motorworks they are only
$14.95 each and come prepainted, and they fit really good. Wolfsburg West is
also sells the little rubber gasket.
