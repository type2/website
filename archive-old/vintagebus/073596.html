&gt;That is just a dorkus fool trying to show off his car.  I'll just bet he
has a hell of an E bay bill to attempt to get that price.
&gt;
It's only $40 to sell a car, regardless of price.

It's another $40 if someone bids or if it hits the reserve though...

So it's $80 to sell a car on eBay or free elsewhere...  ;)
