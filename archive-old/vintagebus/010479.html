Greg,
The air rises to the top (duh) so you have to bleed from the top bleeder to
get all the air out.  However, the dirty, contaminated brake fluid is
heavier than clean fluid so you must bleed the bottom to get all the dirty
fluid out.  I use a clear bottle with a hose from the bleeder into the
bottle.  That way you can just open the bleeder screw and slowly pump the
brake pedal to pump the fluid/air into the bottle.  You don't need to close
the screw between pumps (as long as you pump very slowly).  You can see the
fluid change color as you pump the dirty fluid out until it flows clean.
This method also allows this to be a one person job.  Be sure that the hose
extends down into the bottle far enough to be under the fluid level.  You
have to add a little fluid to the bottle to be able to do this when you
first get started.  Be sure you don't pump the reservoir dry or you'll have
to start over.
goforit!
