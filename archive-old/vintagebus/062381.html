Subject: RE: [VB] fresh air vent cover goo

My 65 DC I sold and my 67 SC I own both have sticky back heavy foam, similar
to the foam seal on the dog house tine on 1600dp engines, and both of mine
were black. And neither had the correct screws.

&gt; On every fresh air cover I have ever removed, there are three pieces of
the

&gt; representative of this stuff....

Hi David,
On all of the buses we have taken apart that is just the grey puddy like 
stuff used to seal to the body on the aftermarket camper type windows.
