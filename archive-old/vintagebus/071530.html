Subject: I'm a bus driver again!

Hi all - I've finally, after 2 years, been driving, and using my '65 EZ 
Camper daily this week.  I put in a rebuilt tranny, transplanted the 
motor from the 60 dc and registered it.  I'm using it as a work truck 
for a kitchen gutting/remodeling job I'm doing for my friends sister. 
(I teach 5th grade, but do this kind of stuff in the summer).

Today, I had my first mechanical failure/quick fix/back on the road in 
5 minutes event(Busted Carb Spring), so I figured it was time to post 
as that usually marks the time that &quot;the bus&quot; becomes &quot;my bus&quot;  It is 
running, driving and working its butt off, and seems to be loving it.  
Haven't driven a bus since since early May when I sold my '71 Westy, 
and it's just great to be back on the road in style :)  Thanks again to 
all on this list who helped make this day happen

Reality check is I probably will be selling it in the fall to move on 
to the dc project, and finally create some space in my overfstuffed 
garage for a very old, but impeccably cared for Wheel Horse tractor 
with every convievable accesory that my uncle wants to give me for 
free.  Oh well, life is full of tough choices ;)
