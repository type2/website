Subject: Maybe this was overdoing it...

I like to see how much I can haul in my buses, but this time I went (almost)
too far:

http://vintagebus_dot_com/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=t1-11

23 sheets of 4x10 t1-11 siding in the back of the double cab.  It wasn't
so much the weight that was the problem, but the distribution - a lot
of the weight was hanging way off the end of the truck.

It drove funky; I had enough power, but braking was iffy and steering
got interestign when I hit bumps.  I've never paid much attention to
load rating on tires, but now I know I need to - these tires, while
they may have been a bargain, are nowhere near as beefy as the Kumhos
on the '60 DD.
