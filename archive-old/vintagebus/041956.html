Sure you can do it!  What you need are a set of tire irons, most easily
obtained from a motorcycle shop.  You'll need three, and get the longest
ones you can find.

First, you must break the bead loose from the rim on both sides.  Lay the
tire beneath the bus (with all wheels on the ground) and use the jack to
push the sidewall of the tire downward.  Put the jack as close to the rim
as possible.

Once the bead is broken, push the bead down into the depressed center of
the rim while using the tire iron to lift the bead on the opposite side of
the tire over the rim.  Work your way around and it comes off fairly
easily.  A little soapy water can be helpful!
