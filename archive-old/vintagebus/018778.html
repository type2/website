IMHO, one of the best motor ideas I've seen for a bus
was a 1678cc. A buddy of mine just had one built, and
while it cost him a pretty penny, it seems pretty
indestructible. You can check his out at...

It's got a nice smooth, wide, powerband, and torque
that will really surprise you. It pushes my friend's
'70 Westy quite nicely.

&gt; I'm also getting ready to have my motor built...
 
&gt; I've had this notion that putting in
&gt; an NOS 36 hp standard motor would be
&gt; the cool thing to do.  
&gt; I also know that myself and my family are
&gt; planning to put the '59 Westy out on the road quite
&gt; a bit. The thought FINALLY hit me.  We're going to 
&gt; be going
&gt; real slow in a fully loaded camper propelled by a 36
&gt; hp motor.
