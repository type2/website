Subject: whistling windows! what? i can't hear you!

as i think about road trip plans i cannot help but think of one thing-not 
getting the motor ready-not planing the camping or the route-but the damn 
whistling windows-i love my bus, but sometimes it is too much for me. anyone 
have any home remedies for the problem of the whistling windows-my only 
trick is to open one wondow a little bit to to make it quieter.
