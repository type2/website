 is it going to be difficult to repair these doors and thier hinges? will i 
 be better off finding replacements?
 i imagine they can be fixed, has anyone had experience with this problem 
 and what i can do to right it and keep it from happening again?
  &gt;&gt;

I have welded door hinges back on.   You can get the cracks welded up.   

shoudl you find replacements?   well, depends how bad it is and how perfect 
you want it.  and how good the replacements are

How to kep it from happening?   Grease, of couse!   your bus loves grease.  
oil the hinges every 1200 says VW.  so do it at least every tune up.   and 
grease the stay open on teh front door, that's teh killer.  the early 64 and 
earlier doors dont tend to have door hinge problems at much as the later one. 
 The little rolly things for the stay open should rll, and grease the prop 
the rollers roll on too.
