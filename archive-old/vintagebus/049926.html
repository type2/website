Subject: Re: [VB] Have We Been Fooled by Berg?

&gt;What Gene Berg meant was and is still true.  Volkswagen made the best oil
&gt;cooler
&gt;
&gt;for VWs.  Gene was one of the very few people who actually did tests to
&gt;find out
&gt;
&gt;if something worked or not.  The rest of the VW idustry just marketed their
&gt;stuff (usually copies).
&gt;
&gt;In the case of the oil coolers, how cool does an engine run when it has
&gt;only the
&gt;
&gt;block off plate over the stock cooler location and an external cooler?  It
&gt;runs
&gt;hotter, right?  How bout those idiots that run the external cooler bolted
&gt;to the
&gt;
&gt;back of the fan shroud?  Hotter again.  In most cases, people just follow the
&gt;band wagon and don't bother checking what actually works.  'You can't run a
&gt;2180, it'll burn up on the street.'  I've been running a 2332cc motor in my
&gt;stock bus for almost a year now, runs great at 190 degrees.


I understand that there was a kit to install the larger Type 4 oil cooler
on a Type 1 engine, mabe w/ a modified fan shroud, w/ a bigger 'doghouse'?
That sounds like a legitamate modification which might actually work.  Is
that a Gene Berg idea?  Is it still available?

&gt;
&gt;If you buy Gene Berg's technical information book, you will see what kind of
&gt;testing he actually did.  I consider him to be one the best VW aftermarket
&gt;'engineers' of the 20th century.
&gt;
&gt;For example, he did a test on running scoops on the side of a bus.  He
&gt;tried to
&gt;make sure the outside temperature was always the same when he did his
&gt;tests, but
&gt;
&gt;he kept getting different readings.  After 'fine-tooth-combing' his
&gt;results, he
&gt;found that it made a difference whether or not the vent wings were open or
&gt;not.
&gt;The amount of air getting in through the scoops changed depending on
&gt;whether the
&gt;
&gt;vent wings were open or not!


AHA!  Here is where I heard about this bus air scoop making the bus run
hotter thing.  Thanks for the info!




&gt;
&gt;Some people think he was crazy, maybe you have to be to be in this industry.
&gt;But he did do some incredible work while he was with us.

Amen to that!
