Indeed, this is starting to look like a Friday topic...but before Thom kills 
it,I would like to mention that I think it is a mistake to comment 
despectively on the hippie lifestyle and their history with VWs, if nothing 
else because many of them had and have a great apreciation and knowledge of 
the VW bug and bus, and that is a lot more that I can say for most people in 
our society nowadays. I live in one of those  &quot;hippie towns&quot;, and thanks to 
that culture I am able to enjoy a big vintage VW scene, availability of parts, 
mechanics, etc. If it wasn't for that,this would be another generic town with 
no vintage buses in sight. Hippies kept them running and away from the 
junkyards (in most cases). Please don't rush to generalize, many hippies value 
their VWs and get the principle for what they where built, enjoying them every 
day, camping in them, fixing them themselves, etc.
And yes, I do approve their principles, idealism and lifestyle, but that is 
another story...

&gt;Ok I didn't mean to start a flame war with the &quot;hippies&quot; lol.  I love my bus
&gt;and gladly missed out on that era of our history.  I am not a hippie and
&gt;don't want to be associated with the stereotypical view of our society of a
&gt;hippie.  They had great ideals and some fought for what they believed in and
&gt;some even went to fight in Viet-Nam.  Then there were the ones who spit on
&gt;our soldiers and dodged the draft.  Anyway, like I said earlier I didn't
&gt;mean start a flame war.  I am gonna have to buy that bumper sticker now, &quot;I
&gt;beat up 4 hippies and all I got was this dumb ole' bus&quot;.  I guess the
&gt;&quot;hippie bus&quot; is part of our culture and those of you that are or rather were
&gt;hippies, &quot;peace&quot;.  what happened to the Motor Rebuild Report and Burning Man
&gt;Event part of this message?
