If you decide to make them, I have access to blank molds (all the plates,
pins, bushings) which I can get a HUGE discount on.  Lemme know if you
decide to make 'em.

Subject: [VB] Repro semaphore lenses?


&gt;
&gt; Is anyone making repro semaphore lenses?  If not, how many people
&gt; would be interested in some, and how much would you pay?  I need a
&gt; set, but if I'm going to have to go through the hassle and expense of
&gt; getting molds made, it'd be nice to maybe get some of the investment
&gt; back.  Finally, are there any differences between bug and bus
&gt; semaphores?
&gt;
&gt; Tangentially related: has anybody come up with a good way of theft-
&gt; protecting their semaphores (other than by not installing them)?  I
&gt; suspect the answer is &quot;have someone repro the whole units for much
&gt; less than stolen/used ones are currently selling for&quot;....
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Dworkin
