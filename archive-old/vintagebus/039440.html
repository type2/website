&gt;tastes that taste great together.  Yum.   Even though my bus looks like a 
&gt;POS
&gt;with the 25 YO bondo and paint in patches, and dents in the nose, and
&gt;significant rocker rot, the dash is beautiful SGR, the cab panels are 
&gt;decent
&gt;original, and it sounds good, so from the drivers seat it's wonderful.  
&gt;Good

This post gave a little insight into some thoughts I had this morning as I 
was getting my 66 bug ready to take to its new owner.  I put $350  worth of 
TMI smooth vinyl upolstery, door panels, etc into it last month and 
everytime I got into it I worried about getting it greasy and thought to 
myself, &quot;What a drag&quot;.  Not only that but its lost some of its original 
character and nice old smell. It looks really nice now but when I think 
about it, thats now why I originally got into VWs.  I had planned on doing 
the same to my 67 kombi but now I don't think so.
  Something I saw that I really liked was a camper where the guy had taken 
the old door panels and used them as a template to cut out new panels of 
thin plywood. He then covered them with state roadmaps that contained HWY 66 
and laminated them.  It was a nice touch. Anyway, I'm rambling.
  Hopefully by next month I'll have the camper interior all in and have it 
on a web site so if anyone is interested in how to cram a 72 walk-thru westy 
interior into a 67 kombi non-walkthru they can get
either inspired or disgusted.  I hope to take it to Albuquerque, NM
to Busses and Balloons in October to see JP.
