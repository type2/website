Subject: A.I.R.S. Request (Statesville, NC)

Chris and I drove down to Statesville this morning and met with Bill
Downs.  The first thing (after the fried engine/tin seal) we noticed was
that there was a 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; gap between the engine and transmission.
The lower stud on the driver's side was out of the engine, and there was
no bolt at all on the upper driver side.  The driver's side engine mount
was also shot.

After a quick valve adjustment and replacing/tightening the
engine-transmission bolts, we tried to start it, no go.  Determined
there was no spark, replaced coil and distributor.  It then fired right
up, but with white smoke coming out the right exhaust tip.  Put it in
gear, eased out the clutch, but the engine just revved, without the bus
moving.

Pulled the engine and found out why, the clutch disk had all but
disintegrated.  The hub was completely separated from the outer ring of
the clutch, which otherwise still had a little life left in it.  The
inside of the belhousing was a mixture of gear oil, grease, and bits of
metal from the clutch.

Replaced the clutch and pressure plate, after cleaning off the flywheel
and bellhousing.  Got the engine started against the bellhousing, but it
wouldn't go the last 3/4 inch (We failed to check it, but we think the
pilot bearing may have been trashed as well and was preventing the input
shaft from going all the way in).   We we pulled the engine back out to
have a second look, we noticed the deal breaker.  The mounting flange of
the bellhousing near #3, from about one o'clock to four o'clock, was
cracked loose.  The crack didn't actually appear to reach into the
inside of the case, there wasn't any oil seepage from the crack, but it
was definitely a lost cause.

Bill now plans to have the bus towed to Airwerks in Greensboro and have
Scott install a rebuilt engine Bill will bring up from Atlanta.

Thanks to everyone for their input and offers of assistance.  Though we
weren't successful in getting Bill back on the road, we gave it an
earnest effort.  We were consoled by the fact that Bill has put 105,000
miles on this rebuilt engine in the last three years!  We advised him to
hug his bus and treat it to a new/rebuilt engine, the old one gave him
outstanding service.
