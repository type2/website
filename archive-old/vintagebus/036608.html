&lt;&lt; Koch's didn't have any shift bushings for that year for that reason, so I 
ordered what you described out of the Rocky Mountain catalog earlier today.  
It is not a barndoor so I will instal the bushings and inspect the shifter. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
You will probably be only able to replace the forward bushing on the rear 
shift rod by pulling the rod forward after removing the forward shift rod.  
Pretty sure you will have to remove both the engine and tranny to replace the 
rear bushing.  BEWARE of breaking the bolts off in the forward shift rod 
coupler, and if you do be prepared to cut the coupler lengthwise to remove 
it.    Eric&amp;Barb
