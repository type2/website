Todd,
Did you undo the shift rod from the front of the bus?

Subject: [VB] Replacing Front Trans mount

Im trying to get ready for BBB and am attempting a front trans mount
replacement. I have removed the motor, clutch cable and large trans
mount bolts (27mm) and the nuts on the front mount. Which is what I dug
up in the archives, but the darned thing still will not budge. Argghh, I
only need 2 inches! Any suggestions appreciated!

Please reply directly since I am on digest, Thanks!
Todd
