Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

John,

I'm running a breakerless ignition system, so the dizzy has been modified
removing the points and subbing in a Hall Effect device and rotating
shutter. Crane XR700 - I highly recommend it. I've run two now, one in
each bus that I've owned, and never a problem - very hot spark at all
speeds.
