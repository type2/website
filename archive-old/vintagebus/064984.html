Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

I just hit on the possibility that the theory might be worthwhile and
stuck some on my strainer plate.
Cost nothing and I'm ok with what I consider long engine life.
At 140K my mains in my first Type IV would still go within tolerance, I'm
hoping for the same on this engine.
