was written:
&quot;the best way to adjust timing is with a timing analyzer on
which you can dial in the total desired advance...and
then time the motor [at] whatever rate your particular distributor achieves
full advance.

I have a vacuum advance distributor, i recently learned how to set it
statically. but i am not sure how to advance it otherwise. It is not a 009
distributor, that is all i know about it, oh yeah it is a bosch dist., made in
germany. there are no markings on it as to the model # or type.
I asssume a timing analyzer is the same as a timing light?...how do you know
what you 'desired advance' should be? how do you know when your distributor
has achieved full advance.
