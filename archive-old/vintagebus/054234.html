Subject: RE: [VB] more on generator shims/belt

Sounds like you don't have enough shims on the OUTSIDE of the pulley under
the cone under the nut

Subject: [VB] more on generator shims/belt


hey gang,
i tried yet again tacvkling this generator problem
last night. the problem is not the belt size. the
problem is i cannot get the belt far enough out on the
diameter of the pulley. right now the pulley is
pinching the belt from the sides and there's a lot of
play in the belt. it spins the generator, but it makes
an awful rattling noise like the shims are loosely
moving around between the pulley sides. anyone have
suggestions for getting that baby tight?
