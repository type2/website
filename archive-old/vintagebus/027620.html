Amen to this.  Thank God the guy who sold me my 62 low mileage double cab was
an ethical seller.  He promised me that since I was the first to call, I could
be the first to see it.  A VERY well known VW person in the Canyon Country area
insisted he let him look at it the night before I was scheduled to see it.  The
owner agreed, and this guy (reportedly) practically throws money at the PO
after looking at it for only a few minutes.  To the owners word though, he
informed that person someone else had called first  and would have to wait to
see if the first caller (me) bought it.  The Canyon Country guy reportedly left
furious.

I saw it the next day.  I came with money and tow bar in hand (highly
recommended) and upon seeing it bought it.  Thankfully, the owner held to his
word.  They are out there....but not many ethical people left.

&gt; my other recent purchase I  sent a good will deposit as I bought this bus
&gt; site unseen and the owner honored his original selling price even though he
&gt; was informed it was worth 2 to 3 times the selling price by others who tried
&gt; to purchase it, my point, there are still good and honest people out there
&gt; who honor their word,
