Subject: RE: 1962 Double Cab value

Before I shoot myself in the foot, I'll amend this...

You are in Michigan, so I better qualify:

Little rust:  I'm thinking one replaceable patch of rust.  1) the battery
tray is gone but a square that is easily replaced (none of the side walls).
2) one of the cab floor panels (passenger or driver) is gone and is a square
patch easily replaced.  3) Surface rust in cab.  NO bubbles or other more
serious rust.

Again, only ONE of the above problems -- otherwise I would not say &quot;little
rust&quot;.  Anything short of a full accounting of ALL RUST AREAS with COMPLETE
descriptions is almost worthless.

Also -- the values below assume this is COMPLETE and original shape.  No
cuts in roof, no cut fenders, no cut engine compartments.  No cuts in dash.
No rats nest of wires.  All gates there without dents or rust (see rust
above!).

&gt; 
&gt; If there is any way he doesn't want this, please let me know!  I've put
&gt; active searches for a Double Cab out there... if he wants something else
&gt; (like a single cab, camper, panel, etc.) I would gladly help in a search.
&gt; 
&gt; As for value... if it indeed has little rust and no or few small dents ...
&gt; easily $1500 to $3000 is what I am finding.  Put in a new tranny and a
&gt; solid
&gt; engine, get the brakes working and steering tight... suspension in
&gt; order...
&gt; interior cleaned up... you are up to $5,000 to $6000 in value.  Get it
&gt; painted and looking real nice... $8,000+?
&gt; 
&gt; This is based on the searches I have found.  The only started producing
&gt; the
&gt; Double Cab in 1958... 1962 is still pretty old (and of value).
