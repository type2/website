Subject: Monkeying with dem carbs...

I just got back in from working in the hot hot hot garage.  Despite the fan
running in my face, I was pouring sweat so I decided to call it a night but
not after first getting my carb linkage on.

The pieces I had ordered was back on April 25th from Performance Parts in
Hauppauge, NY ended up arriving here the 2nd week of June and it came from
some place in California nonetheless.  Whoa.

I had to modify one of the idle stops because it couldn't co-exist on the
same shaft with the Berg fitting.  After a little tweaking, both linkages
are adjusted and it appears the carbs are working together really well with
the visual inspection.  The Weber book helped me dial in the carbs once
again for the base adjustment.  All I need to do now is hook up the fuel
line, put a sump plate and screen on (I've decided to not run a deep sump
for the break-in and when the big day comes to pull the 1600DP out of the
bus, I'll move the sump over then) , and do the whole test run/break-in
thing.  I still need to locate a good camcorder to film this with if anyone
is interested in seeing a real video shot of it.

Later
