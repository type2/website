Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;F&quot;'d up setting my end play

most shims i have seen after use have been either
a) dished
b) grooved or
c) worn thinner than spec in random patterns.
even if you properly set end play, the things are gonna work against each
other, grit will get between them, etc.
its called end PLAY because the crank moves back and forth. the shims are
to LIMIT this movement, not to prevent it. they will see wear from this
movement.
if you have a micrometer, you can at least make sure the reused shim is
close to spec all around; also, lay them on a piece of glass and inspect
them for ANY warpage, kinks... clean them and feel for roughness/grooves.
you CAN reuse them - and lewis does all the time when money is a pinch,
AFTER inspecting them like a hawk - but the damn things are only a buck or
so.  they DO wear, and i have come acroos 2 motors with wacky endplay
changes that were directly attributable to the reuse of worn shims.

get a set of several thicknesses and you are good to go for many motors.

i am aware that most of you will disagree on this, but i DO NOT reuse shims
when rebuilding a motor. like i said, i have $600 invested in new parts,
what the hell is $10 more for a new set of shims to do it right???
