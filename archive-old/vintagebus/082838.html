Subject: apologies to karl!

my abject apologies to king karl, who - for something like the 5th 
time - came across with a much-needed part... and much to my chagrin 
i forgot to write him and let him know it arrived :P

in penance, i kicked some money to the List fund.   i think if 
EVERYONE that karl has helped out were to make a donation, we could 
buy google!

thanks again, karl!
