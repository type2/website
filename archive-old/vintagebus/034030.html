&lt;&lt; I'm pretty sure there was a step for the other side; I think Mark Merz's

'54 ambulance (I shoulda bought that car!) had one; the foot pedal would be on
the other side, ie in the middle of the cargo doors and not the edge.

Your belly pan was cut?  You mean like slots for the step hanger?  You should
have the belly-pan version of the step.
