Hi Mike,
That would be:

How do you like California by now?
Is it everything you expected VW-wise?

There was some on line discussion over on the RAMVA News Group...
Re; Modifying Vacuum advance dizzies for performance engines.
I wasn't all for it and tried and failed to convince the group that this was a
bad idea.
Keep stock dizzies stock,
in spite of what a certain monthly US VW publication says in a 3 part series.

 the argument on their side is found at:

I say run a 009 until you find the stock dizzy for your application
and rebuild it w/o tweaking it.
This will help keep up the dwindling supply of stock spec. dizzies...

Aloha
Ken
