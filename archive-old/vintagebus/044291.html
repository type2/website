 I'm assuming the rear apron should have no cutout as the tip is bent to go
 under the apron.

thats what I thought too.  However I did once find a crank apron with a cut 
out for the exhaust.  wierd I thought.  Maybe I will put a crank start on my 
driver.   No idea why it had this, but kinda cool- looked factory.   had 
never seen another.
