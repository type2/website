Subject: Saphire Radio Questions
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b332d5ccff2f_at_[207.136.16.66]&gt;

I know this was a subject a couple of weeks ago, &amp; thought I'd try to get
some info.

I was recently given a Saphire IX  AM transistor radio. It says it was
built exclusively for VW distributors in the US. It has the number 8BV
012534 on the side.

Questions:
1) Any idea what year bus, if any, this might have come in?

2) Can someone help me with the wiring? It seems simple enough. I just need
to know which color is for what. It's got a black wire by itself with an
inline fuse (hot?), a black &amp; green wire together (speaker?), &amp; another
black wire next to those 2 (ground?). I just don't want to experiment &amp;
maybe fry something.

Thanks for any help.
