It was a really clean bus, especially  for the east coast, but it took some
undoing to get it that way.  I had already stoped all the surface rust etc
that was there. My main gripe to the po would have been the blue and white
cheap ass paint job that flaked when you washed it over the og velvet green.
The excessive stickers came off with a blade and they didnt throw away the
westy interior(except the ice box) when they took it out to install an
&quot;improved&quot; home brew set up. Had some minor wiring hacks, the motor was a
mess,  But got a new one along with a new tranny,  rebuilt front end and
brakes. It was really like a new car, almost never broke.  Closest I've come
to a restored bus.

&gt; I saw it a couple times after you sold it, but not in the last couple
years...As I recall, that was a mighty clean bus...I'm sure it's sitting in
someone's back yard somewhere, or else they moved out of the area...
&gt; Sorry no recent sightings.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My 67 westy was a dead head bus, but other than the paint and stickers
they
&gt; &gt; didn't screw it up to bad. mechanically restored it, cut new wood panels
for
&gt; &gt; the rear and collected all the window rubber etc getting it ready for
paint
&gt; &gt; but sold it to move out west. Any body in the Raleigh Durham NC area
seen it
&gt; &gt; around? light blue and white 67 pop top with a huge Einstein head
painted on
&gt; &gt; the drivers side. and the quote imagination is more important than
&gt; &gt; knowledge.  I lost touch with the owner and have been wondering where it
&gt; &gt; went.
