Subject: Re: [VB] paint formula needed L289

Thanks to all for the help with the code.
I found a paint shop that had the single stage formula,
but the body shop decided to scan the paint
and color match it. I guess they will use the code to
get it close and then tint it to make it match.
I am very nervous about the whole thing.
I had a shop repaint a door on my bug and it was
a shade off. It was so obvious that it did not match but they
thought it was fine. I made them repaint it. The second time
it was perfect.
The bus has been repainted
pretty recently and it still looks great except we had to
repaint the body line on the doors due to the PO mounting
some funky plastic mirrors on them. They tossed the original arms
and mirrors. 3 holes drilled on each side.
I hate it when people do that.

BTW, the hinge pins were frozen in the upper
hinge but they managed to get them out. Another listee was wondering
how to remove them. I can ask them what they did to get them out if
you're still fighting with them.

&gt; Its called blue white, and I got the colour mixed for my 65 westy (blue
white
&gt; over velvet green original colours).  Unfortunately the PPG mix was too
minty
&gt; green, and I went back and they so kindly remixed it .
