The wire *should* be red.  If it was rewired by the
all-knowing PO, it's anyone's guess.  Have you lightly
sanded the contacts or put any contact cleaner on the
fixture, either where the bulb contacts are or the
connection at the back?  Have you checked all fuses at
the block?  My overhead light didn't work because the
connection at the back of the fixture was corroded.  I
just sanded it down, put some contact cleaner on it,
and it wasn't a problem for the next few months that I
drove it.

Paul
