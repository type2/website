Subject: Re: How to lower your 63 standard
Date: Fri, 07 Aug 1998 23:33:28 PDT




&gt;As for bearings? I have no idea what they are talking about, I have 
never had any problems
&gt;
I have heard and seen bearing failures from wheel changes. Depends on 
the wheel that is put on. My 70 bus has me worried because of the wrong 
wheels that it came with when I bought it, bearings showing strange load 
wear.


&gt;that, did you? And I know buses are workers, Mark and I came back from 
Buses
&gt;on the Blue RIdge, in his lowered 64, the bus was packed and the roof 
rack
&gt;loaded, 15 hour trip, no problems!
&gt;  

Correct lowering is better then slap on bad ideas. Must have been a 
decent lowering job.                         
&gt;        
&gt;P.S. I would rather see a lowered bus, than a cut bus.

Cut bus does suck, but a lowered bus is an ugly sight to behold as well. 
At least it is unduable.

I just dont see the point in taking a perfectly good suspension and 
reducing its capability. And although you may have loaded down a bus 
with wieght and it went fine, most busses I have been in that are 
lowered really do ride harsh and bottom out occasionally. Coudn't 
imagine lowering my 63 and still having it carry a ton and getting 
through potholes, ruts, and other unexpected road hazards the way it 
does now.

Jason
Many busses so little space....down to two now! AHHHH Drives me 
nuts...........
