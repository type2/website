Hi from the Calif Coast  Maybe I should dig thru the
past emails for this but ...What the heck...I have a
67 Deluxe walk thru and I want to keep her(been 7
years already)But I think it is time for a new
engine.I wonder if any of you can give me your
thoughts about the way to go on this.I am no speed
freak and I like the idea of a strong engine with a
long life.I have been told an H case? 1500 is the
stock set up but some/most go for a 1600 sp.......Ok,
now the dream part...say money is no object...We go
&quot;Turn Key&quot;? who's? What to look for what to ask for in
parts..remember no speed freak here...just me an old
dude.  Ok then the &quot;Reality Engine&quot; Where do I go to?
Might as well go with new stuff or are old heads ect..
Ok? I have a new 009 and carb so.....extra parts for
the new one as back up? I remember someone wrote GEX
was not the way to go? I live on the central coast of
Calif as far as location to the best deals.What good
engine builders have you found and can send me to?
Thanks..Mark and his 67 Deluxe Cloud Bus
