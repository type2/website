i realise that most of you are from America and not Britain but i wondered 
if you know of vanfest in britain. it is held every year and as i am now on 
the look out for a splitty (i'm now old enough to drive) i wondered i f 
anyone has had experience with buying VWs from shows such as vanfest and if 
you could relay some tips to me on buying from shows.

cheers for your time
