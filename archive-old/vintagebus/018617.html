They *HAVE* to be good - they used a picture of my bus on their main page!

But seriously, I've heard almost nothing but heartache about GEX engines.  For every
&quot;I put one in and drove it forever&quot; story there's 50 &quot;it's the biggest POS I ever
saw&quot; counter-stories.

They're a &quot;volume&quot; shop, and as such, it seems they can't afford to pay 
attention to details and quality.
