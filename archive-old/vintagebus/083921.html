Subject: Beto Pina Needs Parts Hauled from Pasadena to BBB

I am forwarding the following email on behalf of Beto Pina. Prior to his move
from SoCal to Colorado he was a semi-regular member of this list. Contact Beto
directly if you can help. It is unclear to me whether he will be attending this
weekend's BBBX meet or not.
Summary: Heavy bumpers hauled from SoCal to BBB and to Phoenix/Flagstaff.
Stored in secure location until Beto can pick them up. Perhaps that fella with
the $300. cute trailer FS on the Samba could help get them to CO.?

Hey strangers,

Long time no post..
I am hoping I can get some help from a LA area listee heading to BBB.

I have some bumpers in LA that I am trying to get back home (Colorado).  The
bumpers are in Pasadena and if someone could get them to BBB, I can either pick
them up or have someone store them until I get down to AZ.  The bumpers are
Bice bumpers front and rear so they are heavy. They were the bumpers I had on
my 60 Std.

I dont know how I will reimburse the transporter, but well work something
out.

And to everyone else, I hope the holidays were good and hopefully soon, Ill be
back in a bus.
