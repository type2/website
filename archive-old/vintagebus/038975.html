Subject: New Tires for '67 Kombi
Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.927162756.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

I really need to get a decent set of tires for my bus (a stock '67 kombi
with 1500SP engine, unmodfified suspension, 14&quot; wheels).  The present
tires are various passenger-car types (matched Goodyear Vectors
185/70R14 in front, but unmatched cheap 185R14 radials in back).

Reading archives of this list convinced me these tires contribute a lot
to my bus's tendancy to wander all over the highway -- not just getting
blown around, it is very unsteady.  It &quot;wallows&quot; and needs constant
corrections, then corrections to the corrections.

I've been through all of the suspension:  put in good rebuilt spindles.
Steering box, tie rods, alignment, drag link, etc all checked out and
adjusted as necessary, so there's no excessive play in the steering
(anymore).  Wheel bearings are OK.  New KYB gas-a-just shocks.  It's
*much* better than when I got the bus a year ago; now it's less scary at
60MPH than it used to be at 30.

There hasn't been much said about tires lately, so I wanted to confirm that
the tires I have in mind are OK.  Common wisdom seems to be that reinforced
sidewalls are key, and adequate load range is also important.

Both a competent local dealer (Direct Tire in watertown MA) and
the Tire Rack (www.tirerack_dot_com) recommend the Michelin MX Reinforced,
which has reinforced sidewalls, in the 185R14 size.  It has a load
rating of 1540 lbs., which is adequate.

Tire Rack also mentioned the Continental CR21, which also has reinforced
sidewalls.  They said it's equivalent to the Michelin MX except it doesn't
wear as long, but it costs less ($45 vs $65).

Another local dealer recommends a Yokohama light truck tire (he wouldn't
give a model number but it sounds like the Y356) that has 8 plys, and a
load range D.  Not clear if it has reinforced sidewalls, though, but it
was mentioned in the archives as being one of the preferred tires.

What is common wisdom about sizes, though?  A wider, e.g. 195, tire (in 75
profile to get the same height) would have a wider contact patch -- this
makes steering lighter, but what does it do for the stability of a Bus
getting blown around the highway?  All of the dealers have been adamant
that 185 is the right width for the Bus, but of course a 195 with lower
aspect ratio would still have the correct outer diameter.

Who cares if it doesn't fit in the spare tire well, you hang it out
front anyway, to cover up where the Beastly Boys fans stole your VW badge.

thanks,
