Last summer I purchased a pretty complete '67 westy.  The interior is nice
and the seats are in good shape for thier age (some tears and sun fading).

My question is, the front seats are covered in the same material as the
rest of the cushions in the bus.  The material is faded and looks to be as
original as the rest.

Did westy ever cover the front seats?  I can't figure out why someone would
want to cover new front seats to match the back, but anything is possible

your seats would have come in the salt and pepper material which is notorious
for ripping and tearing and virtually all S&amp;P seats in the front have been
recovered so someone probably just matched the back esp. as the material is
sturdier.

 I haven't heard of westy recovering the front seats, though I suppose it is
possible, I suspect it was one by a po when the seats got funky.
