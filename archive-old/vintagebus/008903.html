&gt;
&gt; Last night I ripped my non-idling, non-accelerating, non-tuning 34 out!!!
I
&gt; then setup my spare 30PICT-3 for the bus and we will see how it does
later,
&gt; hopefully tonight.  I run a DP 1600 with polished heads and a mild CB cam
&gt; (comparable to an Engle 100) and I think the manifold vacuum was not
correct
&gt; for a decent idle with the 34.  Should have tried the rivet :)
&gt;

 In defence of the 34 PICT...

I also have a 1600 DP w/ported heads and mild cam plus 009 combination. The
first 34 PICT drove me nuts and it was my own fault as I did not run an
in-line filter. Got the constant 1200 +/- rpm idle and no amount of
adjustment would fix.

Tossed it, paid $10 for another 34 to rebuild, added  in line gas filter and
followed Boston Bob's instructions w/ solid rivet, etc. Also threw in
Pertronix eliminating points. Bus starts within 2 revolutions of the
starter, idles perfectly, and no hestitation through the gears. It has on
occassion got mid 20 + mpg fully loaded at 55 mph. (larger imperial gallons,
eh!). Engine temp, plugs, exhaust color are all on the mark.
