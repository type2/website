Once, when I was towing notorious bus trader Sean 'Hormel' Seitz home from
one of the many shows he has doubled his fuel economy at, a carload of
youngsters so thoroughly pierced that they wouldn't cast a shadow pulled
slowly alongside the Westfailure. One of the bejeweled little darlings
yelled out the window, &quot;that's the longest VW bus I've ever seen!!&quot; As I
silently praised him for his perception of the obvious, I leaned out and
said &quot;It is?&quot; then I yelled back at Sean to take the parking brake off.

Well, I thought it was funny. Stretched bus humor can be a little dry.
