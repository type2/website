Mark,

The 67 had a one year only middle 2/3 seat.  The only way i know to tell when
the seat is out of thecar is by the arm rest.  It is different then the
others.  The 67 has either the arm rest connecting both on the top and bottom
or just the bottom.. I am not sure which it is, but all other splitty 2/3
middle seat's form the 60's are the opposite.  Charlie Hamill of the Bus Stop
gave me a quick intro the seats when i was looking for mine.  If you want,
give hime a call and he can tell you for sure.  (714-892-5293)  I am not sure
if there are any other differences, but if there is one ther may be others.

Hope this helped
Mattehw
