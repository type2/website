Hi Stephan,
Guess so!  The bug, KG, and bus up to 1967 used the same tranny center 
section from year to year, but not the same gearing.  The bus from the early 
1960s used a .82 fourth gear just like the KG.  Which gave the KG a speed at 
3,000 RPM of 65 MPH and the early bus with it's 4.375 R&amp;P and reduction gear 
boxes a speed of 47MPH (1960-63?) with the same size tires as the KG.  While 
the bug used a .89 fouth gear that gets about 60 MPH at 3,000 RPM with same 
sized tires as the KG. 
To install a bug, KG, or even an earliy type 3 tranny all you have to do is 
flip the R&amp;P gear to the other side and instal the bus axles, but then you 
have to live with the incorrect gearing in your bus for the HP you have.
