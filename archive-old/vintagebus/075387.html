Bill,

The reason the lights come on over a period of about one second is because
they are receiving current thru some high-resistance path - the current
isn't enough to light them strongly with a normal fast turn-on, it's very
marginally small, and so the filaments come on dimly, and very slowly.

I've looked at Thom's wiring site page for the 67 USA version unit, which
is also the vintage of my own bus, and it appears that the only place
where a small leakage current (high resistance path) could be originating
from the battery circuits to your taillights is inside the &quot;F&quot; unit, which
I believe is your headlight switch. If for some reason, say 'age', there
developed a high resistance path from the B+ terminals over to your
taillight lead at #58, which goes to the taillight fuses and the
taillights, then upon ignition &quot;ON&quot;, you'd get constant small current thru
your taillights.

Try replacing the headlight switch and see if it clears up the problem. If
so, tell the list, so I know.
