Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

What everyone seems to be forgetting is that he stated that if he
plumbed a short line from his oil pump cover back into the case
his oil pressure was fine.  So he has already isolated the problem
to be related to either the oil lines or his oil filter.  The problem is
most likely that his oil filter is too restrictive.

As far as oil lines not changing pressure, that is not entirely true.
The oil line hoses are made from flexible material and the longer
the line hoses and the larger the diameter of the line hoses, the
more surface area you have of that material to flex and expand.
As the oil (and thus the oil line) heats up it expands even more.
However, there does come a point where it stabilizes and quits
expanding, otherwise they would balloon up and burst.  So there
is an initial pressure loss that later stabilizes.

My guess is that his oil filter is restricting the flow getting back to
the case and building up enough pressure in the line from the oil
pump cover to cause the pressure relief valve in the oil pump
cover to open.  He could rig up a fitting on the inlet side of the
line going into the oil filter and put his pressure sender there to
test the theory.

&gt;If big oil lines are bad, and small oil lines are better, then why not run

&gt;Like George said, if you push X amount of oil into one end of the oil line,
&gt;then the exact same amount of oil will come out the other side. Oil line
&gt;size does NOT change this.
&gt;
&gt;If an engine is suffering from low oil pressure, it is, without a doubt, not
&gt;from an oil line being too large. Low oil pressure is a result from worn
&gt;main, rod, or cam bearings (usually rod bearings), using a cast iron pump
&gt;instead of aluminum which allows air to get sucked into the pump between the
&gt;case and the pump, or a loose oil pump pickup tube in the case.
