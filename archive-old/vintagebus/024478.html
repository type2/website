Subject: WetWesties New Home

Good evening Volks,

WetWesties (The Pacific Northwest VW Camping Society) has a new home!  

The WetWesties mailing list is now hosted on the ONElist_dot_com server.  

(The following is shamelessly swiped from our homepage at 
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~torlasco/WetWesties.html)

&quot;Do you enjoy the Northwest's outdoors? Do you admire the engineering
simplicity of those older VW buses, or the refinements of the later Vanagons
and Eurovans? Or perhaps you are aware of the extraordinary design qualities
of Westfalias or the versatility of Syncros... Then this is the right group
for you! 

&quot;Our &quot;members&quot; (read that in an unofficial/non-bureaucratic/no-fee way) have a
wide variety of backgrounds (an interesting mix, really) but we all share a
common interest in VW buses, traveling, camping and exploring the beautiful
Northwest landscapes. We meet informally throughout the year, usually for
weekend trips, much more frequently during the summer months, in a very family
compatible environment. As an added bonus, I am pleased to say we have some
excellent cooks among our forces, which makes each outing even more
rewarding... The campgrounds chosen are sometimes in very well known and
conveniently located places, other times remote and primitive. It is a great
way to fully know your region, and meet some of the Northwest's best people.&quot;

To subscribe, go to http://www.onelist_dot_com, select &quot;Find a list&quot;, enter
WetWesties, click on it when the search engine brings it up then click on
&quot;Subscribe.&quot;  The rest is pretty self explanatory.
