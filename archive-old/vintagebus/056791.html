&gt; Anyone know where I can get an oilbath air cleaner for my '65 bus?  I'd

Hi Chris,
Then you need to find a pre-1964 40 HP air cleaner and its triangle bracket 
to mount it to the coil mounting bolts.  You will also have to make a small 
adapter bracket to allow the earlier air cleaner to connect to the traingle 
bracket on 1300cc and later engines.  This is due to the slight shift to the 
left of the intake center manifold section that the carburetor mounts to on 
later engines so the carburetor could easily clear the generator.
