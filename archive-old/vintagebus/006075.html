Michael:

If you would like to update your Bus to a ball joint beam. then a 68 or 69
will bolt right in. As for disc brakes, 1971 or newer spindles and brakes
will bolt right onto the torsion arms of the 68 or 69 beam.

One note: the late Bus bolt pattern is NOT the same as the Porsche pattern.
Bus is 5 on 120mm and Porsche is 5 on 130mm.

Thank You!

well my 64 kombi needs some suspension updates.my front beam is well wore
out.i keep hearing that a 68-69 type front beam would fit with no major
changes.is that true.i was looking at bus boys and the price is the same for
a adjusted beam weather it is a 67 down king pin or a 68-69 ball joint.
know if the 71-72 bus 5 lug is the same pattern as porsche wheels.my wife
 really likes the porsche style wheels and if this beam setup will work i
will let her get some this show season.anyhelp would be great .
thanks everyone for all the help so far.i hope it will continue.
