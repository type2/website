I'd keep them for the day when you want to raise it back up....

Subject: [VB] Should I sell the spindles?


After I did the lowering and installing the highway transmission in the '63
Sundial, I have both the old spindles and a tranny left over. I have some
garage clearing to do.

I can send the spindles to Wolfgang for the $100 core credit, Or I can sell
them.

Do the spindles have more value to an individual than that?

And is the original tranny of any real value?

I have a good home for the tranny, if I don't sell it, it will go to good
use.
