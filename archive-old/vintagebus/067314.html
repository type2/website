Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

The motor I have right now is on it's last leg(not sure how much longer
it'll live, but I wouldn't feel comfortable taking it on a long trip), so
I'm having to have a new motor built.  Once the new motor is built, it will
become a backup motor.

The transmission was just rebuilt as a freeway flyer(stock gears, 3:88 r/p),
but I didn't think to ask about giving the transmission more strength.  How
much power can a stock transmission handle without showing me the inside of
it?

My current motor already has a header on it, so I'm used to it being louder
than normal.  That's not as much of a concern anymore though.  I just put in
a stereo in my bus.  2 6.5's up front, 2 6x9's and 2 12's in back with a 760
watt amp hooked to the 12's.  I'm not worried about it being too loud.

I'm ready for the cost.  If somebody will just step up and buy my Panel,
then I'll have enough money for the motor.  Time is one thing that I'll have
to work on though.

I might still down the size of the motor still, just have to think about it
some more.  I'm thinking that the smallest I'd want to go with is a somewhat
high performance 1776.  I'll figure it all out when the Panel gets sold.
Anybody need a '58 Panel Bus?

&gt; Let's see how much guff I get for this! Personally I
&gt; would leave your motor alone or go to a 1776cc. It's
&gt; nice to have the extra torque and all that but there
&gt; are sacrifices you have to make.
&gt;  First of all in order to reap the benefits of that
&gt; motor you HAVE to redo the transaxle, put in a taller
&gt; 4th or remove the RDB all together.
&gt;  Secondly, that motor will be much louder than the
&gt; stocker you have know. You have to run a header on a
&gt; motor that size with at least a 1 1/2 pipe, if you
&gt; don't touch the heads, bigger if shouldo. You shoul
&gt; hear my friends bug. 2275cc, dual 48IDA's and 1 3/4
&gt; exhaust. WOW! It doesn't sound like that big of a deal
&gt; but if you drive long distances a lot, it could get on
&gt; your nerves. It did mine.
&gt;  There are other variables too, but money and time
&gt; being the most important. The bigger the motor, the
&gt; more it will cost. I am sure you have heard &quot;speed
&gt; costs; how fast do yoAhant to go?&quot;. Ahh, and time.
&gt; Tune-ups and maintenance are also &quot;enjoyed&quot; more often
&gt; with the ownership of a big motor even though they
&gt; generally do not last as long as a stock motor.
&gt;  It's a personal choice though, so the decision is
&gt; yours. I just wanted to offer you my opinion.
