Finally,
I got the reduction box back together and finished up the rear brakes.
You wouldn't believe how much air gets in the brake lines with the wheel
cylinder off! Anyway, enough of that. I now need to inquire about a
pre-existing condition that I had put in the back of my mind. Keeping
the engine running! Actually it runs quite well. After it warms up
however it tends to stall when I come to a stop. Giving it some gas
solves this but using part of your foot to brake and the other half to
hit the gas is ackward not to mention a pain in the ***. It did this
when I got it (a few months ago) and I have since changed the oil,
adjusted the valves, replaced the wires, plugs, cap, rotor, points,
condenser, and air cleaner. I static timed it according to Muir and
otherwise it runs like a top. I got the notion it may be running lean
when I was glancing at an R/C car magazine but I just don't know. The
mechanical - hands on stuff is my forte as opposed to the diagnostic -
think about it stuff.
My thanks in advance to those of you who find the time to consider my
dilemma. This mailing list is such a cool resource, as a newer user I'm
still pretty stoked!
