Subject: How Hot does it get in Phoenix, AridZona?

This was shown on Channel 12 in Phoenix the other day.

A cookie sheet was placed on the dash of a car in the Phoenix &quot;Sun&quot; and
cookie dough was placed on the sheet--YES - The cookies were baked inside
the car on the cookie sheet.

This IS NOT a Hoax--

Moral: Enjoy were you are living--It has GOT to be better then Phoenix in
the &quot;Simmer&quot;
