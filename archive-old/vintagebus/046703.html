Hi Andy,
For the 1968-71 tanks the breather tube from the center of the tank goes to 
the filler neck to allow the hump to fill with fuel.  The tube on the tank on 
the end closer to the filler neck looks like it goes to the carbon canister 
and that is hooked to both the tube on the right top of the fan shroud, and 
to the air cleaner at the same time.  Not sure if the later gas caps were 
supposed to be vented or not.
