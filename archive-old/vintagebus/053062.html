No, No, No but check eBay.

No manufacturer name stamped into the piston interior?

If you are saying that $300 is reasonable, I disagree.

-- Original Message --

&gt;I found a set of 36 hp p's and c's for  a reasonable price, but they com=
e
&gt;in a plain white box with no name brand on them. only the size on the pi=
stons
&gt;and part number on the box. they are 3 thousand miles away, so I can't
even
&gt;look at them first. Any one else had a set like this? any ideas where th=
ey
&gt;came from? any one have a set for less than $300?
&gt;
