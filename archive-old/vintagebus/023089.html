Subject: brake fade
Mime-Version: 1.0

	
Brake fade is a condition caused by the lining melting and turning to gas.
The gas prevents the friction material from grabbing the drum/rotor.  In
*addition*, with extended brake heating, you can boil the brake fluid,
which would cause a soft pedal in addition to the fade.  The boiled fluid
is essentially ruined, so after your brakes cool, you are still stuck with
a soft pedal.  That's why people bleed their brakes several times during
the day at track events.  

In performance cars, and bikes, they employ &quot;gas slotting&quot; or drilled
rotors to dissipate the gas.  It's a religious issue as to which to do;
some do both.   I have drilled rotors on the 911, and yes, it does make a
big difference.

What we need on buses are finned drums to help dissipate the heat!
