 &lt;&lt; So how do you go about retorquing the darn thing to 275 short of beating 
 it back on until the holes line up ?  any one else have a better way ?? &gt;&gt;
 Hi John,
 For pre-1971 buses the torque should only be 217 Ft. Lbs., not 275!  To 
 attain 217 Ft. Lbs. you just need to figure your wieght and divide it by 
 217Lbs.  In other words if you wiegh only 110 Lbs. you need to stand 2' out 
 from the socket on your breaker bar or if you wiegh 217 Lbs. then only 1' 
out 
 from the socket.  Note: We said stand on not jump up and down!    Eric&amp;Barb

yup I agree.   People tend to over torque these nuts. you do not need a 
cheater pipe to tighten them.  Do that math , stand on the breaker bar/T 
slider , then tighten it until the castellation lines up with the next slot 
and put in the cotter pin.   This is not a torque that needs to be exact to 
the 1 ft pound.

When you put it together like this and use grease (or anti seize if you like) 
on the splines and threads, you do not need a cheater pipe to undo it.
