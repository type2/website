maybe you could get one of those engine multimeters, that way you don't need
to hook up a perm gauge.

I got one from Actron (www.actron_dot_com) they have a &quot;garage sale&quot; section. Mine
was only about $15. Thanks to Matt for the tip.

I haven't tried it yet...I should be trying it this weekend.
