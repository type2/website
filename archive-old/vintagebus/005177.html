&gt;Lower inner bearing   (same as above)
&gt;Upper outer bearing  211-501-285  3/55-7/67   $18  SKF/FAG
&gt;Lower outer bearing  211-501-283  8/63-7/67   $60  SKF/FAG


I'm going to have to thru my redux boxes soon and am almost apalled at how
much I can tie up just in bearings.  I must admit that when I get bearings,
I settle for anything my FLAPS gets (it's usually skf or timken) and haven't
had a problem at all.  I agree that with a bazillion Japanese cars out there
all running Japanese bearings, they can't be that bad.  Is there anyone on
the list that works at a bearing company that get a few bearings for a
discount price?  Where I used to work (3rd party driveline parts place), I
can get brand new T1 and T2 (at least &quot;was&quot; able to) CV's for half of
retail - we're talking what is normally something like 40 to 60 bucks each -
down to the 20 to 30 dollar price range - huge savings.  I think Todd is
going above and beyond the call of duty in trying to get kits together and
I'm sure I'll be buying from him (great guy to correspond with - fast email
and always answers every question no matter how dumb they may seem) but I
just can't help but think, &quot;There has got to be a cheaper way.&quot;  Do T2
bearings cross ref with any bearing for another application that is
considered &quot;not foreign?&quot;  Or is it possible that with a little machine
work, you could use a bearing that is slightly larger or of a different size
but much cheaper to get?  This is all just food for thought - especially
since I've never seen the inside of a redux box but I'd appreciate some
feedback to this message to see whether or not I'm out in left field...
Thanks for reading...
