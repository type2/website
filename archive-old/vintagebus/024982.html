Thanks,
If you would e-mail your article to me that would be great. I'm just kinda
making stuff up as I go. Down here in San Antonio it seems no one's ever heard
of a bus let alone knows how to fix one. This is my first so I'm learning. I
did find out the size it was through calling a tranny specialist in Hot VW's.
Finding the 42mm is proving to be a challenge however. The best was to order it
&gt;from Snap-on for $42 plus an adapter 'cause it's 3/4&quot; drive for $14. Ouch. I
did find a local tool dealer that sells, I guess, generic 3/4&quot; drive stuff. He
has a set with 5 or 6 sockets, a ratchet and a couple extensions for $60. I
think I'll probably be grabbing my ankles when I go for my wallet on this one.
Oh well, what can ya' do. All for one $%&amp;*  nut.
The irony in all this, and I know this will probably offend some of you, is
that I don't even want to keep the reduction boxes. I'm just fixing 'em for the
mean time 'cause I can't afford Wolfgang's kit's that eliminate the boxes along
with some drop spindles for the front. While I was at it I thought I might as
well throw some disc brakes at it. But then the reality of my financial
situation hit which has left me with my current dilemma.
I hope everyone is happy cruisin' around in their buses. I'll be thinking of
'yall when I'm under mine.

P.S.
David,
Let me know about NEATO. I haven't heard of it.

&gt; &gt;I, of course, don't have the right socket
&gt; &gt;either, it's bigger than my 36mm and smaller than the axle nut (46mm?
&gt; &gt;42mm maybe) So, to the point, I hoping someone can tell me what size
&gt; &gt;socket I need to buy or perhaps an alternate method that eludes me for
&gt; &gt;removing my mangled friend.
&gt;
&gt; Zac,
&gt;
&gt; The socket you need is 42mm or 1-5/8&quot;.  I just wrote an article for NEATO's
&gt; Old Bus Reveiw about reduction box replacement.  If you promise to join
&gt; NEATO I will email you a copy of the article.

&gt; PS, OBR #65 is printed and will be mailed next week as soon as I get the
&gt; mailing labels.
