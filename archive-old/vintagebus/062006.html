Subject: Re: [VB] how to rebuild engine video

Hey Chris &quot;Pon&quot; LaFon,

I used the Wilson book and rebuilt the 1600cc DP engine that was in my '59 
bus myself. It's really not tough and I think the Wilson book was a good 
way to go. If I ran into something I wasn't so sure about, I just asked the 
list. Just plan to take your time and you'll be good. Use lots of baggies 
and boxes to keep parts separate. Good idea might be to find a buddy with 
experience to help you inspect parts when you get the engine apart. Craig K 
in Austin helped me out in that department. Your machinest might be good to 
do this as well depending on who he is. Find a person or local shop to help 
you possibly remove your gland nut and to help you re-install it and set 
the endplay. They should have a big 'ol impact air gun to do that and will 
usually do it for Friday 5:00 PM beer.

The one and only engine I did made successful trip across the united states 
with the current owner...who also says it's still running like a top over 
in Europe. If I can do it....so can you. Very liberating.
