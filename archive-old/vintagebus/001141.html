The &quot;High-Performance Electronic Ignitions&quot; for Volkswagen is a Crane XR700.
They make them in 6v and 12v so since I got some emails from you guys and
gals asking about it, here's some info for you.

Produces up to 50,000 volts on coil (not included)  (My Note: This is a coil
assist setup - you still need a stock or Bosch coil.)
Keeps engine in top tune at all times.
Assures easier starts, better mileage, smoother operation.
Unique optical system elimates wear - you set the timing ONCE, then forget
it for the life of your engine.
Precise timing to within 1/10 of a degree
Easy, do-it-yourself installation - only 4 wires to hookup

Never worry about your ignition again!  Replace your contact points ignition
with this high-performance, breakerless ignition!  It's designed to keep
your engine operating at its peak...ALWAYS!  With hardware and instructions.
Certified by (CARB)
