Subject: Highroof Rear Hatch

I am trying to determine if the rear hatch on a 1964 highroof panel van is 
the same hatch as the one on a standard panel van.  I've heard from some 
that it is slightly different, and others say the highroof and the standard 
panel hatches are the same.  Can anyone clarify this for sure?

Thanks,

Charles
