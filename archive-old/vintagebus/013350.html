&gt; behind the flywheel nut.  Is this 'o' ring a regular part and easily
&gt; available from the usual outlets ?

Yes; it normally comes in the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; engine gasket sets,
but separately should be a few cents.  If you're a regular customer at
your VW flaps, like I am, they usually will kick one down gratis.
