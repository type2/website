All the talk of smashed buses lately has me thinking of insurance, Can anyone 
recomend a good company for collector/antique auto insurance? 
I can add it on to my drivers policy for $120 every 6 months, but thats with 
me never driving it, I was hoping for a limited number of miles per year sort 
of thing. I know its been discussed but I havent been able to read the 
messages in the archives for a few days now. any input is appreciated.
thanks
ronnie
