Hi Stephen,    In a message dated 98-09-22 01:29:12 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Here are my symptoms:
   1) Ok, got the engine in, but it seemed a real tight fit.  I took my time
 and alternated turning bottom two 17mm nuts to get it all in.  Installed the
 17mm up the starter bolt.&gt;&gt;
That does not sound good.

  &lt;&lt; 2) Clutch pedal is completely limp .. obvious sign that TOB and clutch
 aren't working out right.  Wing-nut was almost at end, moved it in 8 good
 turns, still limp pedal.&gt;&gt;
Could be the wrong throw out bearing or too long of a clutch cable of the
wrong year.

   &lt;&lt;3) Can't turn the pulley with the nuts tightened down.&gt;&gt;
That sounds like the tranny bellhousing is too small for the late 12 volt
tooth flywheel.

   &lt;&lt;4) Put it into gear (best I could) and I roll forward and it is almost
 like the clutch is engaged... engine isn't turning and no resistance.&gt;&gt;
That sounds wierd.

  &lt;&lt;5) Ok, I hooked up a 12V battery and check all electrical -- good, but
 turning on starter yields nothing (no noise, no nothing.)&gt;&gt;
Yes, if the flywheel is bound by the tranny housing then the starter is going
to do no good.  You need to unbolt the engine and back it out till you can
turn the pulley with the spark plugs out and then procede to move the engine
back in while turning the engine by hand to get the flywheel to do the cutting
job.  
 
 &lt;&lt;Obviously I have a problem.  How do I tell if the flywheel is NOT enlarged
for 200mm?&gt;&gt;
Well you mean if the tranny belhousing is not enlarged.  Follow the directions
above.
 
&lt;&lt; Did I use a incompatible clutch?  I used this clutch:
 http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/clutch1.jpg  (Although not that dirty engine!).
 Is this not compatible with a swing-axle tranny?&gt;&gt;
That is the one we prefer and many of our friends have tried the 200mm 9
spring pressure plate due to our suggesting it and liked the longevity of this
clutch part in the bus.  
 
 &lt;&lt;Any help appreciated, I have to replace my starter in the '63 as soon as I
get this '65 out of the garage, so the lessons about splits are being
learned... &gt;&gt;
Have fun, Eric &amp; Barb
