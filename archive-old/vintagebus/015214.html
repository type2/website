When Jeff and I towed my '55 home, we didn't check the tranny/RB
fluid.  We really should have.  One box was dry, and it destroyed -
quite literally - the bearings on the trip down.  If we had needed
to go a significant distance (ie 200 miles) it would have been
quite a different rescure story.

The bearings, and remnants, were badly &quot;blued&quot; from the heat, and
the fragments were all over the boxes inside.
