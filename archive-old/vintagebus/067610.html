Subject: Re: [VB] Bus and Bilstien + 944 Phones pics

Hey VVVince,

Still working on that part...

It will be Beetle IRS (Old Speed weld on kit, not clamps) with a lot of 944 
parts interchanged.

It will have early 944 control arms, VW stub axles, Beetle CVs, SAW long 
axles, modified swing plates, Bilstien shocks, early 944 rear disc brakes, 
custom e-brake lines, '74 Super Beetle single side plate IRS tranny with bus 
nose cone and Swepco 201 oil, blue urethane mounting rubber, and all sorts 
of various little tweeks.  If I can make it fit a 18mm 944 rear sway bar as 
well.  Of course wearing 944 15x7 late offset Phones and 205/65/R15 tires 
Kumho KH11s.

Lets just say it will stop on a dime and make change :)  I will worry about 
the go power a little later, but basically an Oxy-boxer T5 conversion for a 
2.1L stroker with hydro lifters and CIS fuel injection.  Probably only good 
for 100-120, but lots of torque (low compression and mild cam with stock 
heat exchangers kill power).

This is not an easy undertaking and I encourage no one to follow in this 
process unless they have the money and time to do it right.  With brakes and 
conversions like this there are many factors that need weighed and a lot of 
things that can go wrong.  Also you have to enjoy grease :)

After a couple of years getting the parts collected and right then I may at 
some time get to the bodywork! :(

Take Care,
Adrian
