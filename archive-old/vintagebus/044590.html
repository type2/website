Thom
I have shipped two Bus's to R.I. one from Texas and one from Denver ABC
transport shipped the first one for $800.00 and did a great job i found a
company that would do it for 600.00 and they did about 600.00 dollars worth
of damage and pretty much told me the bus was unsafe and that if i wanted to
sue them go right ahead i think they tossed in a go F yourself for good
measure. Hints: find someone who sends car's three our 4 at a time (they use
flat beds). Tell your friend to have documention that the car is safe and
inspected. He may have to prove it if they Ding it. And be prepared to spend
800.00 to 1000.00 . It take's 7/ 14 days from date of pick up. I' got
one of them in 5 the other in 8. Most transport co. in the Yellow pages are
just clearing house's that try to hook you up with a kind of gypsy trucker
that's doing that route.Look in Yahoo under Auto transport theres a ton of
them.
