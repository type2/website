&gt; Just got back from showing the safari bus to the local sandblaster to get a
&gt; quote. He wants $400.00 to do the whole bus with walnut shells.  He is
&gt; charging me an extra $100.00 because previous owner  had painted stripes on
&gt; about 3/4's of the bus with house paint, said this was the hardest to take
&gt; off. It looks like there is about 5 different colors on the bus, price
&gt; includes doing both bumpers also. How does this compare with other areas?
&gt; I'm going to have him do the blasting next Wed. He said no warpage at all
&gt; with walnuts and the finish comes out great.  Check out article on BBBVI in
&gt; May Hot VW's.

&gt; I was quoted 600-700 bucks for walnut shelling my DC on a rotisserie in Salt
Lake City.
