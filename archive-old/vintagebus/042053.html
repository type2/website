&gt; I have heard this mentioned a few times by list memebers...but have never been
&gt; able to find full notice of it in the archives, I guess the only route is to
&gt; contact VW via email...i assume any local vw dealer will probably give me a
&gt; read educated looking stare and try to sell me a new beetle...

VW replaced a few late bay heat exchangers in order to get parts to
&quot;study&quot;.  Nothing was heard after that.

Frankly, it's a non-problem.  The level of exposure that you might get
from heating system parts is a tiny fraction of the exposure that will
produce a measurable problem.

If VW ever were pushed to the wall to fix the problem, they'd probably
do the same thing as GM did with my pickup with the exploding saddle
tanks.  They gave me a coupon good for $1000 off of the price of a new
pickup!  Whoo hoo!  At the time, they were giving $2000 rebates to people
who just walked off the street and, since the rebates couldn't be
combined, the settlement was pretty much a ripoff!
