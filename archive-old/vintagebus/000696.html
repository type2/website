 I see I'm missing some sort of bracket from my engine compartment to
 support the air cleaner - i thought it was supposed to be supported from
 the top of my engine bay, but now i see that it is supposed to be
 supported from a bracket that goes behind the coil? - no big deal, i can
 fashon something till the right bracket comes along.
 
 But what about these extra inlets?  What do i do with those?  My current
 air cleaner, the round chrome thing, has an inlet on the bottom, or is
 it the side, of it that has been pinched closed.  So there is the intlet
 that is on the bottom of the snout - maybe 5/8 or 3/4 in dia - what goes
 to this?  Then  there is the smaller inlet in the side of the oil holder
 thing, prolly 1/2 or 3/8 or whatever - what goes to this?

your bus is a 60 right?   the air cleaner hangs to the lefts side of the 
engine compartment and you want the triangle bracket that attach with the 
coil attachment bolts.  You can find one at a swap, and then realise the 
intake manifold you have most likely is too far over and you need to make and 
adaptor plate, or make one out of metal (measure, cut, drill holes to 
attach/w/coil, another for to attach to the flange w/ hole on the air cleaner 
tube, maybe paint black, install)  or even wire it to the top of the engine 
bay around a support on the ceiling.

The inlets are not extra--- they have purposes and functions

The spout on the side goes to the breather by the oil filler - you need a 
long piece of tubing.

The spout by the flappy thing where the air goes into the cleaner is for the 
preheat.   goes down through the rear engine tin (should be a small hole and 
you have a grommet there, but you may or may not have that kind of tin, they 
made so many kinds) and hopefully to the pre heat pickeup pipe, which has a 
flange that is secured at the upper muffler studs under the nut.  This will 
suck air from right next to the head at idle, and help against carb icing.  
Carb icing is bad, and rampant in the PNW in winter.  If you dont have the 
pickup pipe (usually AWOL) you can tuck the lower end of the preheat tube 
between the push rod tubes and the lower tin, and it will pick up warmth 
there, this also works, just not as tidy.

Oil the hinge on the flappy thing.  If it sticks closed your bus will run 
funky.
