&gt;ellis spoke:
&gt;I personally love to see this ad. I think people ought to switch from those
stupid old deluxes to campers. I hear that campers and anything camping
are *way* more valuable and useful than those goofy old buses that let all
of the light and air inside. Campers are tres chic! I hear that their value
has just jumped about 30%. They ought to sell like hotcakes to the folks
who really know an oncoming trend.
&gt;
Jeez, yeah, $22k, that's crazy.  If only there was a camper for like 1/2
that price but was a bit older.  :)

I think the next trend is shorty Buses, I saw a shorty Single Cab pretty
close to the Ellis' house in Phoenix.  That thing is dope, they even shortened
the treasure chest door.  Slide out gun rack here I come!
