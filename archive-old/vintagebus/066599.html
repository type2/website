Subject: Stupid door question ?

I have a stupid door question--A friend of mine wants to sell an extra set
of front doors from a splittie he is having restored.--This set of front
doors are complete--handles--windows, etc. everything is there--Except, for
some stupid reason, &quot;The Restorers&quot;? --Went and cut off, On Both front
doors, the Top hinge. Ergo,both doors are missing their top hinge--No doubt
this does decrease their value. Other then the missing top hinge--both door
are fine. Do not want to make an issue about this as to the &quot;Why&quot;?--But it
happened--If you have any ideas just e-mail me, and I can relay the info to
the owner of the two &quot;Topless Hinge&quot; doors--
