&gt; With the frequent questions about M-codes I was wondering if anyone has taken the time to code a webpage and put them on the net.  If not, I'll volunteer.  Just send 'em to me and I'll put together the page.
&gt; 
I have them on my site:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw

They are also on the NEATO club site:
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

Probably a few other places, too.

I think people just like to get the human feedback.
