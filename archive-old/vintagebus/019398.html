Subject: Pop out window frames
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA76357

I noticed recently that my pop out window is not sealing too well.._dot_casuing
some rust on the bottom of the frame. Overall the thing needs to be repainted
anyway. I have a '65 kombi. I think the original color of this thing was
silver white, like the bumpers and emblem are supposed to be. But I think I
will try the powder coating method, my question is-should this be glossy/semi
gloss/or flat? Has anyone gone this route?
How do I get the window to seal better? right now whenever we get those
houston downpours water just sits on the lip, and some actually gets into the
closet of my camper outfit, just enough to wet the new masonite I just put in.
The seals are practically brand new, and I used tar on the seal that goes on
the body.
