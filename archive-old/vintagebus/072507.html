Subject: Re: [VB] 'go fast' crash box

David,

Why not just replace your reduction boxes with big nut
ones?  Not much of an improvement, but some, and
better rear brakes to boot.  Be careful not to lock up
the rear wheels, though.  Also bigger rear tires would
help, of course!

&gt; It needs to remain stock height, and I'd prefer to
&gt; keep the crash box in
&gt; there.  Would one want to change the tranny gear
&gt; ratios or is it
&gt; possible to change the gear ratio in the redux
&gt; boxes?
