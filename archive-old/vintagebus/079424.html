Subject: Re: [VB] Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

Hello Gary

I would prefer to stay stock.
My bus have a stock '64 transaxle I think :-)

My goal is to get alot of torque and a march speed at 110 - 120 km/h
(approx 70 - 75 miles) on the highways.
I have been fitting 2 1914 engines but they broke down, therefor I want a
TOTAL standard engine with the same torque and horsepower as them. This
might be a T4 engine of a kind.

I have had 1300, 1500, 1600 and 1914 engines and they were all going at
full speed (rpm) just for gain a speed at 100 km/h, that's why I want to
IRS my bus

Any idea, what to change (tranny / ? ) ?

Leave the split window with the stock transaxle and reduction gear
boxes.  Here in the american west, my friends are converting their IRS
split windows back to the stock.
The type 4 engine is not such a great idea
either.
