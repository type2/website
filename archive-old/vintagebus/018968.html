Like I said &quot;or be pampered by someone who really
would appreciate it for what it is.&quot;
Not slammed, turboed, left out in the elements or
apartment building parking lots and used as a commuter
with salt all over the roads etc. Yes, use it~ wisely.
Drive it often and use it for camping and road trips
etc. I wouldnt say &quot;drive the piss out of it&quot;
indicating abuse.

Wait a minute, I said pampered! is this a trend with
all new Dads?

nice, and wash it every now and then.
