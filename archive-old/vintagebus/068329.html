Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Left Rear Brakes (sometimes)

I was taught to replace BOTH sides when doing anything
on brakes.  If one has gone, the other one is probably
about to.  It could be VERY dangerous to do only one
side of anything having to do with brakes.

It does sound to us

&gt; two lines one inside the

&gt; not allow the release of brake pressure.  So replace
&gt; that one flex line...
