&gt; hey volks,
&gt; glad to hear that everybus was another huge success, i
&gt; will definitely be there next year!  i too had a great
&gt; weekend camping, unfortunately just not in my bus.  a
&gt; friend and i were heading out to camp for the weekend
&gt; and catch a couple shows and were about 30 miles into
&gt; the trip when my bus suddenly started to lose power.
&gt; i quickly lose about 10 mph so i shut her down and
&gt; pull over.  go to turn the key and she wont budge.
&gt; long story short, had her towed, yanked the engine
&gt; last night and i found that my #4 exhaust valve had
&gt; snapped mangling my other valve, destroying my piston
&gt; and sending bits of stuff all through my engine, not a
&gt; pretty site('74 1800 engine).  i am really bummed
&gt; seeing this was a replacement AVP head with less than
&gt; 7000 miles on it.  it has not been overheated at all
&gt; and i was doing around 60 mph when it snapped,
&gt; dipstick was so cool that i could grab the end with
&gt; the oil on it without pain.  add to that the fact that
&gt; the entire lower end of my motor was gone through and
&gt; redone less than 2000 miles ago and i am out a major
&gt; amount of cash and not sure what to do.  my mechanic
&gt; just couldnt believe that a valve snapped on a rebuilt
&gt; head either.  so it looks like i am back to the
&gt; drawing board but this problem kinda scared me, i dont
&gt; have a lot of alternatives as to replacement heads and
&gt; i am really poor right now so AVP is one of my only
&gt; practical choices.  what a pain!
