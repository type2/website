&gt;Now I'm going to be running a 6V generator in this bus (although I'd like 
&gt;to run a 6v alternator if there was such a thing for a 66 bus) and am 
&gt;hoping that I have the right gen. stand for it.  Does anyone have a good 
&gt;used 6v generator that they would like to sell.  I could sure use one.

The 1966 bus 6V generator is the same diameter as the 1967 &amp; later 12V 
generator (it also uses 12V brushes), so any 12V generator stand would 
work with the 1966 bus 6V generator.

&gt;Does a 66 bus use a squared off or rounded engine tin in front of the 
&gt;cooling fan right above the tranny and flywheel?  I know my 71 Westy used 
&gt;a boxed shape piece of tin.

The front firewall tin that is squared off was only used on 1968-71 buses.
