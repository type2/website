Subject: Middle seat question

Volks,

When I get my beowie pans welding onto my body in a couple of weeks, I
want to have the dude weld me up some sort of capability to use my '78
Bay middle seat in my '66.  I know you can get the little metal clips
they used to secure the seats to the floor.  Would it be practical to
get some from Wolfsburg West and have the dude weld them in?  I believe
you have to have a concave area in the floor for the prong to snug in
under the clip and grasp it.  Not sure that this is practical.  

Ronnie, do you have anything that will do the trick here?
