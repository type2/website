  dipstick oil temp...

Eric,
What is the highest outdoor temperature you can continously floor your bus at
?
For me above 75 degrees, flooring for more than a couple seconds is
punished by hot oil.

Following what seems to be majority advice here is southern california
I run straight WT40 oil. Can you explain why it does not do a good job
at cooling compared to 5w30 ? I used 20W50 before and belive that oil
was staying cooler.

On my way to Joshua Tree I did the engine compartment pressure test.
With the early bay the compartment is pressurized at 55mph and 60mph
on fourth. Uphill on third at 40 it is vacuum. Never big differences
though, at most half inch of water.
Thanks
- Arnaud
