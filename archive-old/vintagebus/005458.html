Hey!  It's precipitatin' out there, and I am learning about leaks.  Nothing
major, so far...the windshield corners had some seepage, which, when it was
sunny and nice yesterday, I did away with by using clear windshield sealant
injected under the seal on the glass side.  Seems to have stopped it.

The rear window and pop-out windows are holding (no sign so far), but the
reason I'm writing is to have someone explain the path of water
under/through the window assembly to door seal.  From talking with Ronnie
yesterday, I understand that I'll have to take 'em apart again to replace
the broken studs that poke through the top of the door from the bottom of
the frame in order that I can put nuts on'em and cinch the assembly down,
but I am curious as to how water is kept out when we've all got these felt
channels that like to catch it and introduce it into our windows/doors.

Enlightenment?
