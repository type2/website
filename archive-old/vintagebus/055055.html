Subject: Re: [VB] Need an AJ case

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Probably because of the &quot;AS21&quot; magnesium/aluminum alloy, instead of
&gt; the &quot;AS41&quot; that earlier cases were made out of.  Per the &quot;High
&gt; Performance&quot; chapter in later Idiot manuals, AS21 is supposed
&gt; to take more heat and stay in shape longer.  AS21 started in '75 and
&gt; the AJ cases also started in '75, which is probably why &quot;AJ == Good&quot;
&gt; in your builder's mind.  Also, being a late-model case, it would
&gt; have all the little improvements that VW made over the years.
&gt;

I highly recommend you get a copy of the Gene Berg catalog.  Even if you
don' t buy a thing from them, the catalog has great information (and
opinion) from the late Gene Berg.  Specific to you're question is his take
on re using cases, line boring etc.  Check out pages 132 and 133.  He
explains the differences of early AS41, AS21(2% aluminum 1% silicon), and
the current AS41 (4% aluminum 2% silicon).

His opinion...buy a NEW case.  He states &quot;When you use up 75, 80, 90% of
the life of the part, why put it back into service and ask it to take more
stress and strain than it did when it was new?  Don't spend a bundle for
machine work on an old worn out case and expect it to give the service of a
new one?&quot;  This from a company that could make a bundle from recommending
machining cases.  He also does not like the line boring bars located on the
pulley and flywheel holes.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest that you obtain a copy of the Idiot manual (&quot;How
&gt; To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive&quot;, by John Muir) and the Wilson book
&gt; (&quot;How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot; by Tom Tom Wilson).

Be aware that there are some gaping holes skipped right over in the Wilson
book.  Most veteran builders (which I am NOT) would not get hung up as they
are most likely routine for them.  But for the first time builder something
like &quot;install the woodruff keys&quot; as he states with out noting that the #4
bearing and oil slinger must go on first, can cause havoc.  I understand
from others that there is some omission regarding the dist drive install
too.  Things like how loose the dowel pins should be are skipped too.  He
is very brief with regards to cam gear lash too.  What to do if yours is
not correct is delt with &quot;go get the proper one&quot;.
Just a FYI.  I do like the book though.  Mine is so dog eared it looks a
hundred years old.

Steve
