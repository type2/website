I have found the finger painting method of applying silicone sealer to
gaskets to work very well, and try to work the silicone into the
gasket... this is great especially in combination with disposable
latex/vinyl gloves. I was resistant to the idea of wearing latex gloves
at first (conjured up visions of what the over-40 crowd has to go
through once a year...) but the frequency of brake jobs at the wrecker
shop convinced me otherwise. Frequent hand-washing can also be harsh to
those with sensitive skin... But, I keep two boxes on hand for the nasty
jobs that seem to crop up all the time.
	Additionally, I have found that the vinyl gloves are more resistant to
the mineral spirits that I use in my parts washer, and just seem to
harden up a little, while the latex gloves swell and disintegrate
rapidly... If I'm not working with the solvent, though, I like the latex
ones because they don't affect your sense of touch as badly...

...high temp silicon sealant works wonders here if
&gt; one finger paints a very thin layer on each of the paper gaskets made from

&gt; box halfs and finally we use striaght silicon sealant to seal the 1964-67 plug
&gt; on the inside of the redution gear boxes to the swing plate.
