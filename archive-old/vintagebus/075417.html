Subject: Re: [VB] Re: San Jose FLAPS? 12V starter motor needed!

Matt,

Thanks for your suggestions - as usual, they are excellent. I mulled the
same possibilities over in my mind last night, and I've decided to try the
quick-fix, being to replace the starter, as it's quick, but not cheap. If
it doesn't work, I've got a new spare, and next weekend to do all of your
suggestions, and narrow it down. If necessary, I'll run with the manual
clip-on connections til a replacement switch comes in. Ignition switch is
one of the few items I don't carry; strange isn't it? Maybe I'll pick one
up with the starter (be a good idea at this point!).

Thanks again!

cal

&gt; Are you sure it's the starter or solenoid, and not the ignition switch or wiring harness?  Either of those could
