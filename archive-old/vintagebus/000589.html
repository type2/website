Thats gotta be the same bus that was running a 13 second 1/4 mile at 
sacramento the last few times.
That thing is C_at__at_L!!!
By FAR worth 3500$.
I mean, If you put a piece of plexiglass over the roof, 
what you could have like a 500 window microbus? maybe more...there sure is 
alot of holes in that roof.
