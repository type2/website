Drive your bus to work, then when the suckage is at it's most heinous,
simply look out the window.
Later, when you're in the parking lot ready to leave, you can look out your
split windshield at all the chuckleheads in their F%%D Explosions and feel
good all over again.
Works for me.

&gt; Hello alll....This post isn't about anything other than the healing
&gt; power of my bus.......Everytime I come home, no matter how bad of a day
&gt; I've had or how bad of a mood I'm in. As soon as I pull into my driveway
&gt; and see my bus I smile. It totally lifts my spirits instantly.......It
&gt; just amazes me that my whole outlook can be turned around so fast. If I
&gt; could bottle whatever it is I'd be a rich man.........
&gt; Yesterday was a good example, The whole day at work sucked!!!!!! Well
&gt; when I got home and saw the bus things got better. Then we went for a
&gt; little cruise and life is good all over again..........It just seems to
&gt; help melt away all the junk in life and make things more clear.......
&gt;
&gt; Never underestimate the medicinal power of a VW bus....I love it!  Life
&gt; is good.
&gt;
&gt; See Ya,  Shawn
