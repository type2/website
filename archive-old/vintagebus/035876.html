&lt;&lt; I see the over-use of brakes as a sign of weakness, or 
something.....should I use more brake to fend off damage to that which makes 
my bus go? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Everytime the engine turns over one RPM is one less you can get out of it in 
the future.  So using the engine as a brake while not being really bad for it 
does cause wear.  The question you really should be asking is which is easier 
and less costly to replace sooner.  Brake shoes or an engine?  Personally we 
only use engine braking on very steep hills with heavy cargo and have not had 
to do this since we upgraded to the 1964-67 later brakes.  Eric&amp;Barb
