Subject: Installing rear seat belts on a 67
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone ever installed rear seatbelts on a 67 camper? I have a wife and 1 year 
old who want to ride with me. I noticed while I Por-15 my floor pan that 
there are 3 or 4 large black screws under the rear seat/bed. Are these bolts 
used to hold the floor pan to the chasis? Can I use these to attach my seat 
belts ? If you drilled holes to anchor your seat belts are there any areas to 
avoid ?

Thanks.
