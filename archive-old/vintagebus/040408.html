Of Buses and Purity
-------------------

Thank God it's FRIDAY!!!

This is one of my favorite subjects...though it's been beat pure-tee-to-death on the lists. 

Let's think of two scenarios:

Scenario 1. I find the missing '51 US import bus -- we all know that 2 were imported in '51, but so far you goofballs only know where one of them is...well, some of you know. But let's say I find it...in my neighbor's garage. It's still in great shape and I need a car; he likes me so he sells it to me for $100. Old guy; senile; doesn't know what he has. Throws in a box of spare NOS parts too.

Anyway, I buy the bus and I get the kinks out of it, put on new rubber and brake shoes and start driving the dog piss out of it. It ain't got no radio and it goes really slow, so i cut a hole in the dash and install a Kenwood with big-*ss speakers (maybe a woofer pointed toward the road). But for about $400 in bus stuff and $600 in stereo stuff, I got me a satisfying ride and I get a lot of looks as I cruise through the neighborhoods deliverying pizza. Very acoustic if you get the amps up high enough.

Scenario 2: I see an ad on the Internet for a '74 Sportsmobile camper. Dude's here in Memphis. I call dude and he says the bus is broke down in Little Rock for the last 6 years. Dude wants $1000 for the broke down bus. I'm thinking maybe too much, but hey, it's pretty rare, right? And all that pop-top space would be righteous. So I cruise out to Little Rock and check out the bus. &quot;Little scratch&quot; on driver's side turns out to be a big, honker gash, so I offer dude $350 for the bus. He hems and haws for about a week and a half and then decides he'll take it...since no one's gonna give him more. I drag the bus back to Memphis, pull the Type IV engine and start learning about the difference in how much 1600 and 1800 parts cost. I pump about $1300 into the engine, just in parts and 4 weeks later I've got that mostly fixed, with maybe an intake leak I haven't discovered yet. I go through other stuff in the bus and work the kinks out and get her on the road for just under $2000 with new rubber and brake stuff. I drive around delivering pizzas and nobody notices...the volume just don't go that high on this stock AM radio and now I can't afford a Kenwood anymore. But hey, I don't have to shift; it's an automatic.

Now for the question: If it were you in my place, which scenario would you rather be in?

If you answered &quot;Scenario One,&quot; then you are:

Practical, thrifty, young at heart, and Republican.

If you answered &quot;Scenario Two,&quot; then you are:

Employed with a savings account, ambitious, forward-thinking, and Republican.

If you refused to choose either scenario, but hit the reply key to flame me before getting to this line, then you are:

Arrogant, self-indulgent, deceiptful, and a Nazi.

If you immediately saw the problem and went into deep meditation to come up with a solution but hours later realized that you'd rather have pizza, then you are:

Stoned and don't vote, but you're pretty sure you'd be a Democrat if you did.

If you recognized that it wasn't fair to judge me, but you had a burning desire to hunt me down and beat me to within inches of my life, then you are:

In dire need of counseling...and probably a police officer.

If you took all this very seriously and are now contemplating a serious flame...cross-posted to the Type2 list, of course, then you are:

Sillier than I am and oblivious to the fact that it's Friday.

My philosophy on all this: If you buy the bus, do what you want to it; if I don't like what you're doing, I'll vote with my wallet.

Thanks for indulging me...and oh, by the way, one of these scenarios it plausible, but I ain't telling which one just yet.

;) Joe
