&gt; Do you guys with roof racks park in garages? Seems like it'd be too tall
&gt; for the door. How about carports? I want to &quot;look coool&quot; with my wood slat
&gt; roof rack, but doesn't make sense if I can't pull in the garage at night.

I can get my Crew Cab in the Garage with the rack AND canopy. Just takes some
&quot;adjusting&quot; of the height. The rate I go I'd bet I could get a highroof with a
rack in a standard garage.................
