Subject: FW: [VB] 21 vs 23 - which is more rare
Date: Tue, 24 Oct 2000 10:06:23 -0700

I have a 63 15 window deluxe, which means 23 were made into 63, like Steve
say's. If we are talking about rarity, what about the 15 window? I have seen
way more 21's AND 23's than I ever have 15's. Anyone agree? We are talking
more rare right? Not more popular. *Example* I have twenty Han Solo figures
from the star wars movies, and one Salacious Crumb (Jabba the Hut's little
rodent sidekick). The Han is more popular, but the Salacious Crumb is far
more rare. See what I'm saying?

Seth

&gt; they're in indecent condition to start with.   23's were made from

&gt; those few years saw heavier production of all models.   

Really the 23 was made until the end of the 63 model year... which ended
in august of 63, so 23's were made one more year than you say (i've seen
late 63 23's so i know of what i speak on this one, for once..)

take care,

Steve
