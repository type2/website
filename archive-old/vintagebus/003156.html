Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

&gt; Not trying to start anything here, but I dearly love a technical
discussion.

Bummer, they bore me to tears. I like a good drunken argument myself.

(Boring technical details snipped)

&gt;Maybe I'm a little dense, but can you tell me again WHY you feel this is a
bad
&gt;gearing combo and will &quot;OVERREV&quot; an engine at 60 MPH?

In all actuality you are most likely a genius and in all probability are
100% correct. I never suggested that it was a &quot;bad&quot; gearing combo, I prefer
to say it's a good combo that does bad things. I have only had two buses
that went from bus centers to bug centers, and on both of them the top speed
dropped 5 miles per hour at the same rpm's. Other gears weren't affected
much. Neither were split cases, before or after. Obviously I paid to much
attention to the speed before and after and not enough to gearing numbers. I
stand corrected, not that it matters much. I am going to put a Rancho Pro
Sand center in my singlecab with mountain boxes to bring my top speed down
to about 43 or so at 4000 rpm's. That, connected to the 2275 should
eliminate the need for the unnecessary 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears once and for
all. Right now with the 3:88 Rancho box in it will do 53, but you still have
to use 2nd occasionally to start on an uphill. Irritating, all that
shifting.
