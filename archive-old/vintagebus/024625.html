Wow, that is news to me!  My westy has a string of holes drilled in the
rain gutter where the channel was attached.  I just assumed that is the
way it came.  I was going to weld up all the holes any way.  This is not
good news for me though.  Now, in addition to finding the missing longer
forward piece, I'll have to procure the additional metal
backing/clamping strip.  

Guess I'll find them sitting right next to the NOS gray pop top
surround, icebox, curtain rods, and interior lights in unobtainia
land:-[
