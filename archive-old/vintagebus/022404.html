Subject: Single Cab gates FS (set of 3), Sacramento
Mime-Version: 1.0

I figured I'd post these here before I put them on ebay, to see if there
are any takers.  I have a well-used set of gates for a split singlecab for
sale.  They are rust-free and have good hinges.  They do have some surface
rust, and they will need some bodywork before paint (especially the
tailgate), but are a solid set to start with.  I will post pictures for
anyone who is interested.  I am asking $350/set obo, and I will consider
seperating them if there is enough interest in the individual pieces.  The
tailgate can be shipped UPS, but the side gates are waaaay too big.  You
will need to pick them up from me in Sacramento, or arrange for another
method of transportation.
