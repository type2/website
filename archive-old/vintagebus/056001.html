Subject: Re: [VB] Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)

On the subject of making things run cooler, I did this mod to my bus, and it
made a HUGE difference in cooling during sustained high speeds:
http://geocities_dot_com/eaallred2/doghousemod.html

It's ugly, I know.  But all you can see when you open the engine lid, is two
more silver hoses (heater hoses) going to the back of the engine, and
dumping the hot air from the oil cooler onto the exhaust.  This allows me to
remove the front piece of tin, without worrying about the hot air from the
doghouse going back into the fan.  I made sure to have my lower tins (that
go between the heater boxes and case, under the cylinders) in place, with no
major gaps too.

I do have all my tin, and all my seals in place, the bus just wanted to run
too hot for my liking while doing 65mph for miles at a time.  I like my bus
to run the same temp as my bugs.  Just how I am.

anyway, removing the front piece of tin allows a lot more air into the
engine bay, than what the stock louvers can supply.  I know I should watch
out for road debris getting sucked into the fan and all that.
