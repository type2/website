&lt;&lt; As for bearings? I have no idea what they are talking about, I have never
had
 that problem. And the Corvette tire thing, you didn't say you wanted to do
 that, did you? And I know buses are workers, Mark and I came back from Buses
 on the Blue RIdge, in his lowered 64, the bus was packed and the roof rack
 loaded, 15 hour trip, no problems! &gt;&gt;
Hi,
 Bearing are the parts that allow your wheels to go round and round without
falling off or grinding to a stop.  We were using that experience of ours as a
example of what changes can and will do to ones bus.  If your trip with your
lowered bus was 500 miles to and from (Since we do not know how far your trip
was.) then try driving it over that same trip 100 times and then that would
equal 50,000 miles.  Double that and you would have something to start saying
that you had no problems.  We put 20,000 miles on our 1960 panel every year,
most of that carrying cargo.    Eric &amp; Barb
