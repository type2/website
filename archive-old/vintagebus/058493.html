Subject: [VB] Turn signal switch part 2

Well, I've got my switch rebuilt and looking nice...we'll see how well it
operates.  My next question is, how does it clamp to the steering column, is
the a bushing of some kind that goes between the switch and the column?
When I screw both halves together around the steering column, it's too big
to stay up, it just flops down to the brace.  What gives?
