life's a bitch, isn't it. at least i'm not scared to identify myself, and i
can take all this crap i've been getting lately. and hey, i bought my bus
that way. do you, &quot;mr_dot_denver&quot;, really think i'd have painted it that way?
since you obviously have some kind of stalker tendencies toward me, you
should know i'd have gone original on the color-mouse grey/pearl white. the
next time it needs paint/resto, do you think i'm going to paint it (and
it's a FORD color) maroon and white? and sure, i have a pertronix, sure. my
distributor bushings were worn on my (GERMAN) 009, and i had no other good
distributors, so what the hey, i worked at a vw shop and got a great price
and decided at the very worst it could be a back-up if i had problems with
points.  at least i remember to oil my distributor shaft so my advance
doesn't lock up--a common problem i saw with idiots putting new
distributors/pertronix in and not doing the oiling thing.
as far as the computer thing, well I still don't own one. i use rachel's. 
i am still of the position that computers and the on-line auctions and such
are ruining the auto hobby by jacking up prices to the insane level (like
$1400 for nos stamped bumpers????????), and everyone wanting to get rich
quick. sure, i have some things on ebarf right now, but it's stuff i'll
never use, i've taken to shows and NOBODY buys there, so why not? i have no
need for an nos 6V headlight relay. i've taken it to about 6 shows, nobody
cares. maybe someone in cyberspace does. if not, i'm out the fees to list
it-and i'm the loser on the deal. if so, then we're both happy-it's gone
from my garage and the buyer is happy to get it. i'm not trying to get
rich, and the start price is lower than i asked at shows, so........  i put
stuff on the planet first as to not start a bidding war, but again, i
usually get no response, so.. shows are few around here without driving for
days to get to one.  if i can make a few $$ on the side, why not? it's not
like some people who don't go to shows anymore and just sell on ebay
exclusively, is it?
any further questions, &quot;john&quot;?  i thought you died in a plastic goopy mess
about 5 miles from here a few years ago, didn't you?

&gt; what happened to &quot;I hope all your f*cking computers 
&gt; crash and burn in a plastic goopy mess!!&quot; and 
&gt; &quot;Kill your computer!!&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever seen a subhatch westy painted 
&gt; burgundy &amp; cream like an Buick Rivierra and with 
&gt; Pertronix stock from the factory?
&gt; 
&gt; man, times have changed...
