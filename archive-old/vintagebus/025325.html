  if it has the standard upper vents in the rear of the bus,plus a second
additional set of vents it could be from australia.
where i believe they used two sets of upper vents.
-bench seat panels have one row of upper vents per side
-walk-thrus panels no upper vents
-australian bench seat panels two rows of upper vents per side
any aussies out there to confirm?
