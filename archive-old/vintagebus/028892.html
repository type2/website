I would have to say every time i drive one of our splittie buses--someone always has good things to say--&quot;I remember those&quot;  &quot; I had one like that&quot; &quot;Where are you going surfing in Phoenix?&quot;  as i have a set of snow skis and a surfboard on Bessie--No doubt VW Splittie buses have a most
positive image to most people--Maybe when they were really out there is was a good time of the century? Very, very, few times has there been anything negative--In fact i cannot recall any incidents of this when they See the bus--Most of anything that comes back negative is when i Tell
some VW people about Bessie--or they hear about it--Also in Phoenix our VWs are always aceepted at Any car club event--Drive -um--Enjoy-um, its just that easy--TWWM, uj
