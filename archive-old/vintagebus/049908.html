&gt;It looks like your Bus was built right after all Transporters got
&gt;the big (46mm) nuts, regardless of 3/4 or 1 ton rating.  Like,
&gt;the same or next day:

&gt;I *think* the only differences are in the running gear, particularly
&gt;the reduction boxes and rear brake drums.  I don't think there is
&gt;anything special about the chassis, like extra frame rails etc, but
&gt;I could be wrong about that.


The front axles are different, aren't they?  Different (smaller) king &amp;
link pins, brakes, etc?

I had a '62 23 window years ago, and mounted a '67 anti-roll bar on it.  I
remember it being a bit different than the bus I took the bar off of.
