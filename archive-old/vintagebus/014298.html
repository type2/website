i am ineed of some good interior pics.my 64 11 window has no interior at all 
but the 2 front seats and the rubber mat up front(no panel,no headliner and 
rear seats.i was thinking of making it into a westy style interior but i can 
not find some good full pics of the interior.and i also will have to put 
seat belts in the rear for my 3 yr old and my 6 yr old sons.and everytime i 
see a glimpse of a westy interior i see no seat belts. is there a compony 
out there that makes a generic interior kit to convert your bus to a westy 
or do i need to go out to the scrape yards?and one more question if i so 
find a westy in the scrape yard what years would fit into my 64 walk thru?is 
it only going to be 67 down or can you put a later model interior into it 
with lil mods?sorry for the dumb questions but like i said before i am new 
to the type 2 scene and there is none in my lil town in NC.

thanx for any help
