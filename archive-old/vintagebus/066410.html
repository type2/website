  Rich Yost (aka Old Buses) has an awesome rotiseree that he built. If you
go to the Old Buses web site I think there are pictures of it there.

A few I found via Google.  No bus specific, but a few interesting (some
scary) ideas.  Give Mo More at the Transporter Garden a call.  They had
the full tilt resto shop truck on one to do the paint/body.  Not sure if
he might have photos/details/plans for a bus specific rotisserie

Let me/list know what you build/find.  I for one plan on building one
when the shop is done...when ever that is ;-)
