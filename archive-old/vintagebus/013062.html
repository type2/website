I highly recommend this weekend of events.  I am one of the ABC members Amanda mentioned and the VTO/Box on Wheels guys always welcome us at their campout.  Very nice place.  Wouldn't miss it.

&gt;&gt;Any of youz guyz that have been before know of camp sites or
&gt;&gt;camp friendly parking lots near the Classic?
&gt;&gt;Remember, it's not, &quot;How high are you?&quot; it's &quot;Hi, how are you?&quot;

I am very sad that I won't be able to make it to the classic thisyear....but
I always had a great time with my club(VTO).  We usually
would
meet up with Box on Wheels for a BBQ and campout at their shop..I know
some
of ABC would meet up there too...then caravan to the SOTO show the next
morning...from there we head to O'neil regional park for the Old Bus
Campout...and the next morning head to the VW Classic...from there, some of
us few brave souls would then caravan down to Mexico, campout
overnight...play the next day...and head back before night fall.  Quite
a
fun weekend!  If you want I could make a call and get you more info...or
you
could try writing Rich (VTO VP) at  neato_at_gte_dot_net .   Hope you enjoy the
show!
