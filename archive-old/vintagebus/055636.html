Subject: Re: [VB] Hippy Bus Needed

Ahhh ha ha ha ha.  The world is so small.

I used to shoot free lance for these guys.  That was about 5 years ago.  They were hard to get paid from, but I think they've change management since then.   I work up the street from them now at NBC.  The name does not sound familiar.

&gt; I just recieved this email (scroll below).  As you may know, I blasted all the hippy artwork from my bus, but any of you deadheads in CA that are interested can contact the guy below.  Who knows, maybe you'll make enough dough to buy a new bandana, Birkenstocks &amp; some weed.  :-)  Good luck.
