Subject: Re: Starter bushing fits loosely--a problem?

&gt;From: Richard Lenzmeier &lt;dicklenznd_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;However the new &quot;6V-to-12V&quot; bushing I got from WW just slides right in.
&gt;And out.

The only starter bushing I've done (stock 6 V replacement in my '64) fit
nice and tight.  I think there are four bushing sizes: stock 6 V, stock
12 V, 6 into 12, and 12 into 6.  A good parts guy can probably tell them
apart by looking, but the $6/hr person in the warehouse trying to get the
right bushing out of four adjacent bins probably can't.

For reference, the new bushing I installed was 0.652&quot; or 16.56 mm OD,
measured with an inch caliper.  The ID of your bushing will be different
than what I had, but the OD should be pretty close to this, I think.

&gt;If it will be a problem if left like this, has anyone got a
&gt;workaround

This is clearly a sign that you need to stay 6 V!

&gt;Fargo, ND

Uh... Stay 6 V and shop for crank-handle tin, too.  :)
