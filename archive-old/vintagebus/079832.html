Subject: Re: [VB] new buses to the collection

Sounds good. OK it sounds awesome! We too added a truck to our &quot;fleet&quot; over the weekend! 1960 Singlecab in decent shape. It has dents and dings but I started stripping the turkis off and the original Dove Blue underneath looks pretty good. I'll post some pics on the samba soon.
