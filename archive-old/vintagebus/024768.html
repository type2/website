Camp Box News has been defunct now for years.  Any remaining
subscriptions dues were refunded.  If anyone was missing something feel
more then free to contact me.

I can get copies of back issues for westy info starved people...maybe it
might be best for me to scan these in and if someone has some free
server space we can post them to the net?  i currently don't have the
web space.

Just for the info, Camp Box News was dedicated to pre`67 Westfalias and
had tons of neat westy info, pics, ect...  

As other folks can atest, doing this type of newsletter-club it is/was
too much work for one person to do, and I had to quit.  

Contact me if anyone is up to posting them to the net.

Todd
