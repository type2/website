Terry,

I'm not the List moderator, but hey, can we cool the hateful
name-calling?

It sounds like you're pretty excited about the work you are doing on
your Bus, which is something that ALL of us on this List have in common.
Along with that rabid enthusiasm come some equally strong attitudes,
opinions and emotions. 

I would imagine you have an old Bus, not a new minivan, because it IS
old, fun, quirky, distinctive, rare, and cool. Now imagine someone with
your enthusiasm taking those Bus qualities to an extreme. We call them
Vintage Freaks, along with other names. To them, ANY change from the
original is wrong, even if it does make it safer to drive. Their Busses
are a rolling museum, like living in an automotive time-warp. This is
the essence of Busdom to them, and they benevolently want everyone to
enjoy this experience as well. When you get their opinion, it is liable
to be strong and yes, closed-minded.
 
When you post a message to this group, you are inviting ANY and ALL
opinions to come at you and your idea, which, like your Bus, is a
reflection of yourself. It can be easy to take these opinions
personally, but I think one needs to remember:
  
a.) You asked for comments.
b.) The way a person types a message may not accurately reflect their
intended mood/sense of humor/sarcasm, etc....
c.) Maybe THEY are having a bad day and just need you to cut them some
slack.

I do not know what was said to you by the people in question, nor do I
want to. If you want to have a war, fine. But please do it off-List.
Let's try to keep the Love on the List.

Sorry for the rant, I couldn't help it.

Peace,

Dave
