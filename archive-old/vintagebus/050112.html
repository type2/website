&gt;	It must be very difficult for B. Hoover to place himself in
&gt;harm's way and then lament that decision.  By advertising that he is a
&gt;knowledgeable and competent mechanic of all things, including quantum
&gt;mechanics, through the methodical answering of most questions posed to
&gt;him at his public address, he establishes first and foremost that he is
&gt;*willing* to do so.  If he is overwhelmed by the number of questions and
&gt;responses, then he shouldn't have place himself out there as a resource.

Quite so. If you make yourself a target, Shawn, you mustn't be surprised if
people abuse you. Absolutely.

&gt;Rather than become bitter about the task of replying, he should simply
&gt;drop out.

Damn straight. Most astute.

&gt;Place the knowledge he has to offer in the sermons, update
&gt;them when he changes his mind, and leave out any personal contact.

Incorrect. By your incisive logic, Bob Hoover should withdraw entirely and
be shed of the lot of us. The sermons generate far more idiot-mail than the
list does.

&gt;Clearly his rambling is in part due to the necessary &quot;futter mein ego&quot;
&gt;spirit of any engineer, let it exist as that only.  I suggest he cease
&gt;any further communication with the strangers he so loves and abhors....

Dead on. You're quite a thinker. Your parents must be very proud.

As of 8/15/98, at Bob's request, the Sermons archive has been taken
permanently off-line. Those of us who had relied upon the Sermons as an
indispensible source of technical wisdom and spiritual inspiration should,
I suppose, send our questions to Shawn Zenor and Michele Putman and Diana
Krebs.

What I got by way of explanation is here:

No I am not sending anybody a copy of the archive so don't ask me.
