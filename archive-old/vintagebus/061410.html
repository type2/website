Subject: Re: [VB] so-23 child's cot &quot;hooks&quot;

&gt;&gt; ok, if my bus was actually here w/ me, i could
check
&gt;&gt; this...  (long story!)  i was wondering if the hook
&gt;&gt; that holds the front cargo door strap would double 
&gt;&gt; for the hook that holds the child's cot bar in a
so-
&gt;&gt; 23? the photos i've got LOOK pretty close...  
&gt;&gt; *grins*

&gt; *very* close, but not exactly. When I got an SO-23 
&gt; in parts I tried that and was scolded by my &quot;Westy&quot; 
&gt; friends. I'm sure it would work, but it's not the 
&gt; same

i'm a little confused on this, different part numbers?
 different shapes?  i've now seen two original camper
interiors (1960) w/ black hooks.  i've also seen
photos of several w/ chrome...  the chrome look like a
different shape, but the blacks are the spitting
image, at least to the untrained eye.  weird... 
anyone know if chrome is correct for '60, or is
black????
