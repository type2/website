O.K. ronnie talk to me- which type 3 cooler are you running. It appears t=
hat there are 3 types of type 3 coolers, but the early style is obviously=
 different with the other 2 being close. I own a type3 and have both styl=
e coolers lying around somewhere. I am debating using a t3 or t4 cooler w=
ith my next motor (90.5x76). Below info. is from a type3 site.

&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;Early coolers have 8 mm oil inlet and outlet holes. T=
hese have no part number marking anywhere.

Late coolers have 10 mm oil inlet and outlet holes AND have the part numb=
er stamped on the top of the body, =20
just to the right of the pressure switch boss, so you can identify them w=
hile installed.

Both coolers are IDENTICAL in vertical dimensions.&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;

&quot;Did the dipstick
test after driving approx. 50 miles _at_ 70/75 MPH up and down long grades a=
nd
could still pull the dipstick so must be running cool enough (type 3 tigh=
t
finned oil cooler), no oil light flicker at idle so it's ready to go.&quot;
