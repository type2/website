&gt;I was having rust problems when I first started using the tank in the
&gt;'55, so I did two filters ahead of the pump, in series, and the second
&gt;one was catching stuff the first one missed.  Makes sense to me to have
&gt;it ahead of the pump, and not after..

FWIW, I have been told by several mechanics (VW and Non-) that pumps on
cars do not like to draw thru a filter, unless it has a sediment bowl, and
a head of liquid to pull off of. Something about aspirating instead of
swallowing, I believe (pulling air and not fuel).
Personally, I am looking for a marine filter that has a sediment bowl AND a
cut off valve; placing that between pump and tank should do the trick.

I'd pass on the orange doo hickeys.  And your pump already has a built-in
filter; with the old bolt-together style being the best.
