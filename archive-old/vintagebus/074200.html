I give up guys! I'm not trying to sell you anything! All I can base anything I
say is on the hundreds of engines I have done. The classroom is fine for
theory, but eventually the mechanics of the situation takes over. Over and out
on this subject!

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

&gt; Did physics get replaced with fuzzy logic? Small pump, large lines, low

No, big difference here.  Oil is incompressable.  The main restriction to
oil flow should be the bearings and the goal is to deliver sufficient oil
flow at sufficient pressure to the bearings.  Running smaller hoses causes
a pressure drop in the hoses resulting in less pressure at the bearings.
Larger hoses reduce this pressure drop.

With incompressable fluids, if you put one cm^3 of oil in one end of the
hose, you'll get one cm^3 out the other regardless of the size of the
hose.  You can't lose volume unless you have a leak or _very_ elastic
hose!


&gt; At
&gt; highway speeds the pressure will build and stay, around town the volume
&gt; is too great to keep the pressure consistently hi. The pressure drops
&gt; are rapid and rises slower. I've seen too many people with flickering
&gt; oil lights at idle with big tube full flows and a factory oil pump.

I would be more worried about their bearing clearances than the line size.
That pressure is escaping somewhere!
