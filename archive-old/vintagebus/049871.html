&gt; &gt;maybe someone as a representative of approx 1000 bus owners could contact
&gt; &gt;someone higer up at vw and get it done easier.
&gt; &gt;pipe dreams....... but as long as were dreaming lets dream BIG&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;I think we're too small in numbers for VW to care about.

Actually I recently had mail from somebody with Arnold Communications,
which is the agency that handles both the advertising for Volkswagen of
America, and the web domain vw_dot_com. Apparently there is a push to &quot;put more
stuff on vw_dot_com that is of interest to all in the VW community&quot;, meaning
people who own vintage VWs. I hope they really do it.

Of course this is the Marketing Arm, which has nothing whatsoever to do
with the Technical Arm, which is where parts (and real consideration that
means something) come from. But still, a gesture is a gesture and it's nice
as far as it goes. Maybe if there were a LOT of interest and I were
informed about it OFF THE LIST, I could forward it to Arnold Communications
and say, &quot;look, we'd really, really like to have the microfiche on-line.
How about it?&quot;

That way you could call your dealership with a VW part number instead of a
description like &quot;the vacuum thing next to that big black canister&quot; and
maybe get a better reception.
