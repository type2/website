Subject: RE: [T2] NADA on drugs!

Yes I am a Board member of NADA

According to NADA a &quot;LOW&quot; condition vehicle is an ORIGINAL Vehicle requiring
just
minor reconditioning--or an older restoration--&quot;Low&quot; according to NADA is
Not a beater--I am still working on the 1967 VW and earlier values--Have Not
gotten to the 1968 and newer--Also I am NOT the only person upgrading VW
Values--I will take what ever &quot;Heat&quot; there is out there.--When an update is
due, NADA send me a form--So just keep letting me know--Remember we Must
have a way to protect our older VWS!!
NADA Is a legitimate source--Also in many cases you will not get your 100%
investment back  Keep ALL receipts--take photos--keep 100% records--and it
will help in court--Keep on Truckin-, uj




B.G.-
Send this to Uncle Jerry ( Jerry and Melissa Jess- vwstuff53_at_msn_dot_com  ).
I believe he is on the board at NADA that sets these values.

Subject: [T2] NADA on drugs!


&gt;
&gt;Just found the NADA site.  5000 for good condition, 8500 for high end, and
&gt;3100 for low! What kind of drugs are these people taking? A 69 bus in crap
&gt;condition is worth 3100?  Where do they get these prices?  What planet did
&gt;they take them from? Whose but did they pull these out of? I look at !_at_#_at_!!
&gt;bay almost daily, and am a car trader, and classified ad freak.  Since I
was
&gt;8, and I am now 32.  I have very rarely seen a fair bus at 3100.  And if I
&gt;did, it had a hard time selling.  I mean median price on 68-79 is usually
&gt;around 1500.  I did not even pay more than 2000 for my 67 deluxe walkthru
&gt;from Walnut Creek Cali. no rust, or rot, a dual port 1600, and 3/4 original
&gt;rack.  My 71 and 69 eack costed me less than 1000.  MY 71 was a no rust
&gt;westie with 13,000 on the engine.  Needed a little tlc, but decent bus for
&gt;700.  Where do these values come from?    B.G.
