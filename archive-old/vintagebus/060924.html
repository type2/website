Subject: Picnic June 30 in West Houston

--0-1830459104-1024538024=:43412


 Just a reminder....I am putting together a picnic at Cullen park (Saums near Barker Cypress) Anyone with a VW or VW interests is invited. Sunday June 30 meet at the exK-Mart Hwy 6 _at_ Cairnway at 11am for a cruise to the park. The park has lots of tree cover and is a beautiful place for a picnic. BYOF (food) The have small BBQ pits or you can bring your own.
If you have any questions or need directions p-mail me. If any out-of-towners want to come down the night before, my house is open.



Thanks,

Brian
