Subject: [VB] Front tranny mount, steering wheel adjustment
Message-ID: &lt;3839E4EA.5E57DB8C_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Friends,

My front tranny mount went out on me this weekend.

I installed a urethane front tranny mount in my baby today. I didn't
pull the engine and tranny (this is the third time I've done it this
way, and every time I swear I'll pull them the next time), I just took
the cables loose, loosened up the bolts on the spring plates, pried and
cursed and banged my elbows, etc...

This is an Empi item we had hanging on the wall. I've not been real
crazy about the Empi stuff I've seen so far, but we didn't have a
regular bus front tranny mount in stock (no, a bug tranny mount won't
work).

I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who has used these before, how
long I can expect it to last, etc...

Also, someone asked the list a couple of weeks ago how to center the
steering wheel on a splitty. I never saw any responses to the query. The
steering wheel doesn't have splines like the later models do. It has a
woodruff key, which means the adjustment must be made down below, I
suppose...
