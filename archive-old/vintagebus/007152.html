&gt;oh yeah...on a lighter note... my shop teacher today tried to tell me
&gt;that all vehicles that have rear wheel drive have a drive shaft
&gt;(singular) such as ones running from front to rear.  so I told him about
&gt;my bus and the other ACVWs.... his face got red....it was great.  earned
&gt;me an extra point on my test too!


Oh for cryin' out loud.  What planet is your shop teacher from?  I can think
of several vehicles that are rear wheel drive that don't have a drive shaft.
Besides the obvious VW's, what about Porsches, tractors, Corvairs, and road
graders?  At least you got an extra point out the deal but come on - he
couldn't have been serious.  Or could he? :-)
