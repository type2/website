&gt; any indication if that is a us only thing??

I have no clue.
The company who makes the calendar is teldon calendars, www.teldon_dot_com .
I emailed them for details on maybe getting a box of them to spread out
to those who cant get them at a dealer. I'll keep you an the list
informed.
Maybe we can have folks send in pics of their buses and have a
vintagebus_dot_com calendar next year? Might be prohibitively expensive, but
looking into the idea is free....
