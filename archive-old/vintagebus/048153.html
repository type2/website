&lt;&lt; was looking in my parts book and there apears to have been a part, part 
#111 201 571, Cover- Tank Unit Opening.  I always figured pre gas gauge buses 
had a gas tank without a hole in it for the sender.  I mean, what purpose is 
the hole for, cleaning it out?
 
 Can anyone confirm or deny this hole cover?  If there is such a monster, I'd 
like to acquire one.  If anyone has one for sale, trade, etc. please let me 
know.  I'll trade you a nice sender for it.
 
 TIA. &gt;&gt;

in my book that looks like the gasket between the fuel sender unit and the 
tank.   though there  is another p/n for that in the electric section by the 
sender, so if it is a cover, it is good for blocking the hole in the tank 
when you dont have a sender.  if yor sender goes bad or something.  doesn't 
makes much sense, yes non gas guage buses had and sender hole free tank.   So 
big deal, use a sender or cut and piece of metal and drill holes in the right 
places. 

The gas guage was an option listed in my parts list from 20-117901, I have an 
early guage and sender dated 57 i got from a 58 junkyard bus.
