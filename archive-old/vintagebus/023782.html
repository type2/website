Subject: Salt &amp; Pepper material

I finally tracked down the material i am going to use for my 65 Samba.
A few of you on line wanted to know what it was, so here goes.

It is the seat material out of a 86 Chevy &quot;Bronco II&quot; (The smaller
one).  The material is a cotton based material that looks like the vinyl
S&amp;P stuff.  It looks very nice when installed in the bus.  I saw a bus
with it at the Classic.  The owner was very happy with it and i thought
it looked the best of what i had seen so far.  The guy who did the
install said it was easy to work with.

The trouble, where to get it.  I am not sure right now.  I am in the
process of looking.  I will let anyone who wants to know where it is
when i find.  If anyone out there knows where to get it, please let me
know.

Thanks
Matthew
