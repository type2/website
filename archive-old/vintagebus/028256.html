&gt; I installed a 035 distributer w/the vacuum advance.  My old bus engine

&gt; problem.  If I turn the distributer to advance the timing the engine RPM's

I would throw Muir's timing chart away. 

On an upright engine...40hp to 1600 and their various big-bore/stroke
versions...correct initial advance really has nothing to do with what
engine case you have, or pulley, but rather what dizzy you are running.
I go 5 degrees btdc for a mech advance, 7.5 with the single vac, and
zero with a dual vac, assuming you are using a strobe and will check not
only final advance, but that when you unhook the retard circuit ( having
set it with both hooked up) it advances up to about 5-7.5 btdc. That
tells you that the retard circuit is working. If you insist on setting
it with the reatrd and advance vac lines unhooked, make sure to plug the
lines so you dont have an intake leak while you set it, and set it to
7.5BTDC, when you re-hook it should now be at 0.

 Static lights are great for setting the timing before you run the
engine, but for petes sake, check it with a good strobe. I have seen
some funky dizzies with some way out there final advance, something you
would never find out with only a static light.
