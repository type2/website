 &gt;Our brakes are *embarrassingly* loud.
 &gt;&gt;The answer that I got from the shop is that due to the
 &gt;lack of asbestos and increased metal content in the
 &gt;shoes &quot;they all howl like that&quot;.
 &gt;
 
 
 I have never had loud brakes on a bus. NEVER. Counting off the top of my 
 head:
 4 67's a 63, a 60, a 64, two 70's, a 68, 2 69's.
 
 thats 12 busses without that problem. Something is wrong.

neither have I had brakes squeal unless something is rubbing or shoes worn 
down to metal.   Even with new shoes bought within the last few years.    
They don't all howl like that.  

sorry, but what year VW is squealing?  had it been sitting for a while, or 
did this suddenly develope?
