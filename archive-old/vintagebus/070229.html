Subject: Mystery VIN

Hello list,

Well today the New England weather finally got to the point where I could
have my bus out of the garage; a week ago today it was snowing.

While I was admiring my bus, a '56, I noticed for the first time that the
VIN is stamped on the driver's side B pillar just below the striker plate.
I had never noticed it before and I've never seen reference to the VIN in
this location.  Was this a VW thing or did a prior owner put it there?
There is paint in the number and I think it's OG but I'm not positive.  BTW,
this is not the same as the body number which is behind the seat.

Any thoughts?
