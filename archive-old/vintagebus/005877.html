Now this I have never seen so far! It really does look like building a
complete new Bus. And I thought that the way I work on my bus is the best
way. It's nothing compared to this. It sort of looks like a resto that Thom
started on his RHD bus. Boy, I'll be checking this site frequently.

PS. NQ - you said once that body-off resto on a bus is impossible - now!!!
do you need more reasons to keep working on your bus???

Later,

&gt;
&gt; Some of you may remember me writing about someone in Holland who is doing
a
&gt; complete 'body off' resto of a split window bus. Since the basic build-up
of
&gt; a bay is not too different of that of a split the pictures of this resto
are
&gt; giving some insights you would never otherwise get.
&gt;
&gt; I have recently added two more pages (bodywork 1 and 2) so you may want to
&gt; come back and have a look.
&gt;
&gt; Goto to http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus and click on &quot;T1 restoration&quot;
(under
&gt; the heading &quot;Technical&quot;) to get the full story.
&gt;
&gt; Since I don't own any splits myself I'm not on the vintagelist. maybe
&gt; someone could cross post this message there. Might be of interest to these
&gt; guys (and gals) as well.
