Subject: RE: [VB] Beating of a dead horse!

&gt;Timing setting on a 34pict3 - 009 set up 

As always I will interject that a vacuum dizzy (can get new ones for about
$120) and the 30-PICT-3 is the way to go on a bus...  I got 23.5 MPG
(average of two tanks) in a loaded westi this weekend on the highway (55-63
MPH) with a 205 T pure vacuum dizzy (timed at 0 TDC at idle and 30 degrees
all in) and a 30-PICT-3 with a 132.5 main jet.  In town MPG is around 18-19.
Oil never got over 190F either!   

All that being said, since you have this other combo...  I used 32 degrees
at 3500-3800 RPM.  Dizzy should be &quot;all in&quot; at 3500 RPM.  Some people go 34
degrees, but I think that is too much extra heat in a bus.  

Also you have to rev the snot out of the engine to keep it in the power
curve.... Drop me an e-mail if you want me to try and dig up a used vacuum
dizzy.  Also if Will Wood is still around he used to do miracles with the
dizzys...  Have not heard from him in a while?


Take Care,
