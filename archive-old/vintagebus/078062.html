Subject: RE: [VB] bbbrake adjustments

  When is the last time anyone has ever even seen a brake shoe radius
machine. They went to the way side with asbestos linings. Most shoes are
radiused at the manufacturer, At least the shoes I sell seem to have been
pre radiused.
  Their is a heavy truck repair down the street from me that relines shoes
and they have a radius machine but I have never seen them use it.
  If I could only find riveted linings I could have all my shoe cores
reskinned their (riveted on)
