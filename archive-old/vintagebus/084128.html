The aftermarket VDO sending units that I have seen are adjustable two ways

My VDO fuel sender was of the sealed type. I didn't notice when I installed it but unless the metal cylindrical cover is removable I don't see how it could be adjusted. All this one had was a small hole in the bottom and the small hole at the top where there was a small metal plug covered by a sticker (that was removed before installing). It was just like the one I replaced.
