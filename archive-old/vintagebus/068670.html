&gt;Mine did that also, even after building and installing the Matt Roberdson
&gt;special. I pulled the emergency switch after I noticed I could get it to
&gt;work when I wiggled the handle around.

That seems odd.  In a Bus with a 9 prong box, the only thing the switch
does is ground a relay coil.  If the switch contacts have developed high
resistance, it seems to me that the relay wouldn't pull in at all.  In
other words, it's hard to have a relay &quot;half on&quot;.  I'd think the problem
would more likely be corrosion on one of the relay contacts inside the
9 prong box, or a broken wire.

In my 9 prong box replacement, the switch grounds 4 relay coils in
parallel.  Still, if the switch is screwing up, I think it's much more
likely that none of the 4 relays would turn on, instead of 3 out of 4
turning on.  Again, a problem at the relay contact or with the wiring
is probably more likely.

Most 12 V automotive-type relays I have played with have 80-90 ohm coils,
and will pull in at around 8 V.  This implies that 4 of them in parallel
(20 ohms worst case), at a 10 V (worst case outside of cranking) system
voltage, should be able to tolerate 5 ohms of resistance in the switch.
Since most switches should have a resistance less than 0.1 ohms or so,
I think the switch would have to be pretty screwed up before it stopped
being able to pull in the relays.  If you have an original 9-prong box,
with just one relay coil, it might be able to handle up to 20 ohms of
resistance in the switch before failing to pull in.
