The only red flags to come up, is you folks really like to work to hard!!  
  1. Never wire wheel or grind rust this just pushes the rust deeper in to the
metal.  Sandblasting is the only way to go.
  2. If you can't afford a sandblaster and insist on grinding, use 40 grit,
then follow up with 80 grit.  If you start off with 40 grit the you not only
save time but your shoulders.
  3.  Prime, let it flash, Prime again, and if two coats are not enough prime
again after it flashes.  Their is no need to sand between primer coats if you
use this method.  But be warned the more coats you apply the longer the drying
time.
   4.  Once dry, block or pad sand your primer with 400 grit wet paper.  Use a
squeegee and reflection to get all the fuzz off.
    5.  Your ready for paint!
  Peace, Love, and  I mean who wants to work harder than they have too!
