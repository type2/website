&lt;&lt; The camper came to me with worn Elephant Ear mirrors.  I learned that 
these were a custom option that replaced the round mirrors from the stock 
kombi (right?).&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Not custom, but a dealer VOA accessory which should have the initials of VOA 
on the front of them.

&lt;&gt;
Could be either after market truck mirrors or again a VOA accesory from the 
dealership.  Except for special orders, buses would have come with only one 
mirror on the drivers side.  Eric&amp;Barb
