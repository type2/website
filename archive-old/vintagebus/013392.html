&gt;Well, not all that new, but the prices have come down to the point
&gt;where they are becoming very practical for a lot of folks.
&gt;
&gt;My wife (bless her heart) gifted me with a Garmin GPSIII+ for Father's
&gt;day.

 Nice add-on George . . .

 What kind of price range with all the goodies is the Garmin ?

 That 100 meters . . I heard that . . I can only guess they are
jiggering the readout for coordinates . .

My feeling is there is no way you can have a 100m error, go in 
any kind of a 360 circle and not be miles off getting back to 
camp . .

I have heard  . . and actually read somewhere a fix for this
error . . like you change the value of a couple resistors . .

Unfortunately the data came from a cowboy and I feel better when
they are  telling me about cow parts . . :-)
