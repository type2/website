I seem to recall reading that Jaguar made a very similiar beauty ring that is
a lot more easy to obtaina nd cheaper. I think I read about it in one of those
Brit VW Rags. 

Also side note that 61' sealing wax red westy that has is being featured in
the newset &quot;vwcampers&quot; british rag has already been extensively documented in
total vw and  volksworld.

M.

Does anyone have a source for these?  Anything at all out there besides
trying to find an original set?

Thanks
Matt
