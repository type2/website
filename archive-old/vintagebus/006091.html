It has always been my understanding that the crows feet rims were for
trucks, the non crow's feet for buses. No proof I guess, just what I heard.

&gt;Yup!  We call those crows feet.  They reinforce the area right around the
lug
&gt;bolt holes.  Seems to have been a design manufactured from about 1955-59
for
&gt;VW.  We have found a 1956 or 57 rim from another manufacture that does not
&gt;have the crows feet reinforcements
