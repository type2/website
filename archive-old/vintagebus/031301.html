&gt; Well, you won't like my comments on it. But how high
&gt; is the maintenance on your reduction boxes? All you
&gt; gotta do is check the fluid, boots, adjust the clutch,
&gt; blah blah blah. You will have to do that with that
&gt; late model stuff.

Well I would rather replace an axle and CV joints than replace 4 redux 
box bearings.  To me, its easier.  Those bearings can be a real bear 
sometimes.  I know I had a helluva time with my lower outer bearing last 
year on the 62...

Whats the maintenance on the CV joints Mike??  Look at them once in a 
while (at oil changes perhaps?) to see that the boots aren't torn.  Wow, 
that sounds hard.

CVs weigh less too.  Less weight - more speed  :)

More power to ya Erin!
