 who would have made this sort of thing?  I realize its in Brazil... but
 would this have been available through places like JC Whipme back in the

 just curious... I like it. &gt;&gt;

That's a kool accessory, but I wanna know what's up with the bus that's 
modeling the steps? I never seen ribs where someone's put on an over rider 
tube.
