My shock preference has always been the Heavy Duty version of the stock
Boge oil shock. This shock works well for all but the most grossly
overloaded bus. Unlike the KYB gas shocks, it has proper compresion
dampening AND extension dampening. Most gas shocks have very little if
any extension dampening characteristics and WAY to much resistance on
the compression.

The last time I had reason to purchase a set was in 1997, and I think I
had to do a little digging (may have called three diffrent FLAPS) to
find a full set of German shocks. 

See the piece on Bus Handling at:
http://type2_dot_com/library/suspens/handle.htm to see what else I would do
to strike a balance between ride comfort and secure handling.

I think that article is as valid today as it was 3 years ago.

Have Fun

PS, it's been three years since anyone mentioned it, but has anyone ever
tried to fit a Z-bar to their bus? I always felt it would work better
than a camber compensator.
