&lt;&lt; I've always said...if you plan on registering YOM (Year of Manufacture)
 plates in California, you need to know more about the process than they do.
 It's not tough...but you just need to know you're right so you can
 effectively argue when they want to destroy your plates. They seem to want
 to do that often...that's what they tried on me too.

        An interesting tid bit in regard to the plate registering. Floridians 
have had the option of registering the YOM for a long time now, I am unsure 
of the years though (I believe up to 1975). Anyway, I purchased a 1967 plate 
for my bus, which first has to be sent to the state capitol for 
authentication. Then, after about 3 weeks or so, you get it back and then may 
go legally register it. Well, upon checking out a little bit of information I 
found that I could get an antique plate. Which is what I did. Apparently the 
laws have been changed. It used to be 1947 and older. Now it is 1947-1970. I 
sure get some extra looks when people see the plate on the bus! 

        Best wishes,
