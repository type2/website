Subject: whoops!  and other things

Sorry, that last message was intended for the T2 list, not the VB list.

anyways,
I'm curious if anyone has ever messed with limited slip or posi in a 
bus.  Was anything like this ever offered?  Didn't Porsche offer it?  
How is it done?  Anyone have it in their bus?  I was talking about it 
with a friend a few days ago and am just kind of curious about it all.  
I've never messed with anything of the like and really don't know 
anything about it.  I think Steve White was talking about it a while 
back,,,anything ever come of that Steve?

Isaiah
