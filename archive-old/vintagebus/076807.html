Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? /sliding door deluxe

I'll second Ronnie on that.   The dormobiles were made on sunroof buses.   I 
think hi roof buses had subfloors, as well as the DD and sunroof buses.  I've 
only seen a couple deluxes w/o subfloors, and they were &quot;home made&quot; deluxes.  
pics of your bus?

re rocker trim, I haven't seen that many sliding door deluxes,  don't 
remember , can't find the pics I thought I had of the 2 that were at Bad Camberg 5 
years ago

i have never heard of a factory sunroof bus without belly pans. even sunroof
standards and westy dormobiles got the pans. do your m-codes back it up?
engine bay vin match the others?

&gt; As an aside I have a 67 Samba Non walk through sliding door model.  There 
are
&gt; no belly pans fitted nor can I see any sign of them being fitted. I  was 
told
&gt; all Sambas had belly pans. Is this another urban myth? Mike
