Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] no rings no things?

&gt;Since you have
&gt;it in a shop, I presume you pay to have your VW worked on,

nope, but 2 toddlers prompted a decision to have a 'professional' 
shop do it this one time, so i could sleep instead of being awake for 
24 hours for a week straight.  that, and the fact that the 2 yr old 
liked to stick screwdrivers into the shortblock last time i had one 
open...

&gt;  so at this
&gt;point there is no point in not spending the extra $85 to replace the
&gt;p&amp;c's so as to be safe rather than sorry.

they are machine-in 88s... $260+++ for a new set. ain't happening.


&gt;  If it was mine, I'd chance
&gt;it,


at this point, i'm sorta curious to see HOW MUCH f_at_ck*d up stuff i 
can put back in, and see how long it goes grrrrrrrrrr XP
