 &quot;and is not CW &quot; ?. 
Hi Mike,
CW=Counterwieghted cranked.  We used to run engines with stocker cranks and 
when we retorqued the entire engine at 30,000 miles it was amazing how loose 
the engine case/head fasteners were!  They were almost just finger tight.
  With CW engine with flaps that we have now with over 60,000 miles.  When we 
stripped it to a longblock at 40,000 miles the engine case/head fasteners 
were still very close to the stock tightness!  So not only do CW engines cause 
less noise due to less vibration and thusly less driver and passenger fatigue.  
Also now a little more HP ( you get more a little more MPG also) goes to the 
wheels because the energy that previously went to make vibration and noise now 
goes to the tranny and wheels.
