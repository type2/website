&lt;&lt; Then when the engine is running, air is pulled thru the canister and the

Hi Roger &amp; Trudi,
Actually it is a pressure and suction action.  The tube on the upper right of 
the doghouse fan shroud pushes air into the charcoal canister, while the air 
cleaner sucks the vapor into the engine.

&lt;&lt;Seems to me enventually the charcoal would not work anymore. &gt;&gt;
That is what we have heard.  Would be nice to know when or how many miles it 
takes to go bad, and if there is any way to repair/replace them or not.
