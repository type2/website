AZ4Bangerz.vwspeed_dot_com has been removed for the time being. Any questions 
about the club or anything else can be forwarded to Volken67_at_aol_dot_com. 
Questions about the site can be answered by me. Sorry for the inconveniences 
this causes to those who visit the site.

(BC)    Looking for a passenger dogleg, prefferably used in great shape for 
the 67 kombi. Will pay any reasonable price plus shipping. Finally found out 
how much the feds are giving me back and I should be able to replace my nose 
skin, dogleg, pass. door and seat pedestal. Let me know if you have anything!
