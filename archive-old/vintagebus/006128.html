I have to agree with you man.  Eric and Barb had my clock for a bit over 3
months and since they told me that is the minimum I would have to wait to
get it back, there were no surprises.  I like being told the truth about it
instead of promises of quick turn around and then getting stuck with a 3
month waiting period if you know what I mean.

Anyway,  Eric and Bard kept me informed regularly and I was astounded at how
much work they put into the clock.  It comes back clean with repainted
needles, and all that kind of meticulous stuff you hear that clock repairmen
and jewlers do.

I praised them then and I praise them now and btw, my clock is still running
fine.  It's neat to sit there in the bus at night and hear the tick tick
tick tick with an occasional thunk from the little motor that winds the
spring. :-)
