Speaking of tools of destruction.....has anyone ever used the Milwaukee
power drill motor with the metal shear conversion??
If not, and you find yourself needing to cut sheet metal on a more than
occasional basis...check it out.
It can make really nice cuts...does not distort the metal...more durable
than an air nibbler and faster too.  It can cut tight corners and circles
with ease.
For doing cutouts from templates...I haven't found anything better.
My most used tool for removal of stubborn parts and pieces off of donor
vehicles still continues to be the trusty hot wrench.  One size fits all!
