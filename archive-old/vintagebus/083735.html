Subject: Re: [VB] Porsche Pulley

After doing a lot of research, and thinking on the
subject of fan speed ratios, I finally dove in last
night. The real factor here is not pulley size, but
fanbelt size. Since the fanbelt does not ride on the
outside of the pulley, the effective diameter of the
generator pulley changes, depending on where your belt
wants to ride in it. You can get some improvement in
fan ratio, simply by going to a smaller belt, that
rides lower in your pulley. But there's a lower limit
to size your pulley can accomodate. A search of the
list archives shows that a 9.5mm x 900mm V-Belt is
available as a power steering belt or something for
old BMWs. You could probably put one of these on your
stock pulley, shim it up to fit, and get a faster fan.
In any case, here's what I did:

I Checked my current ratio with Scat degree pulley,
and cehap chrome alternator pulley. Came out to about
1:1.73 Not the worst, but not great. I was running a
11.5mm wide belt, and the length was 912mm! I could
have probably gotten some improvement with just going
to a 905mm belt, but I decided I wanted about a 1:2
ratio.  Did some math, and estimated that I wanted a
890mm fan belt. I Went up to the auto parts store, and
they let me go in the back, and look through all the
V-belts available. They only had two widths....3/8
inch, or 1/2 inch. That works out to 9.5mm or 12.7.
Well, 12.7 should be way too wide, so I went with the
9.5. I grabbed an 890mm belt, and a 905mm, just in
case the 890 didn't work out. When I got home, I dug
through my junk pile, and found an old 36hp generator
pulley. The 36hp pulley is a bit smaller than the
later one. 

Well, I think an 890mm belt is pushing the lower
limits of what will fit on a 36hp pulley; it took at
least 10 shims between the halves. That many shims
pushes the rear pulley half back a bit, causing a
small amount of pulley offset. The fan ratio is now
1:1.93 (woo hoo!) close enough to 1:2 to make me
happy, and the porsche pulley seem like an unnecessary
expense. I'll run it on my next trip, and see if the
offset causes belts to break. If everything holds
together, I'll be quite happy with this solution. Raby
says you can get a 25 degree reduction in head temps
with a faster fan pulley! If I find that I'm breaking
belts, I'll have to figure out a way to eliminate the
offset. Maybe machine the front of the pulley hub
down? or go to a sand seal behind the crank pulley
with a spacer?
