&gt; Hello...
&gt; 
&gt; Hope someone can help me figure out what my master cylinder is on my 67
&gt; Deluxe walkthrough (vin 257076396)

Your 67 MC is a one year only thing - its VW p/n is 211-611-011Q.
Wolfsburg West has it listed in their latest catalog for $225. You can
pick them up occassionally at VW shows; I got one in great shape with the
reservoir for 10 bucks at the 96 Irvine Classic. Guess the guy didn't know
what it was from.

&gt; First, the existing (bad) master cylinder reads &quot;VARGA 25IND.BRAS.VFCC 
&gt; IR 3066  0025-6&quot;.  Don't know if that will even help.  I don't have a

Do you know what is &quot;bad&quot; about your MC? If the rubbers are just worn out
or broken, then rebuild kits may still be avialable. You want four 22mm
'cups' ( basically flanged &quot;O&quot;rings) - I believe they are the same item as
used in the wheel cylinders. That and a good cleaning and check out for
corrosion - maybe some honing with some super fine grit emory paper, and a
final rinse with isopropyl alcohol - 95% or purer. Be sure to note the
directions that the flanges go before removing the old items! There's
between 2 and 4 of them in there - can't recall at this point. 

Don't leave *any* trace of oil or water in the MC when reassembling - You
may use some brake fluid to lube the reassembly.

If you can find rebuild kits for the vintages wheel cylinders, they
probably do the trick.
