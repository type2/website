&lt;&lt; So I'm gearing myself up to work on my transaxle and have a question.  So
 I'll be taking my redux boxes apart to change the bearings and I also have
 to change the seals under the side-covers.  What is the best way to do that?
 When I loosen the side covers should I pull the tube right out and replace
 the gasket and O-ring that way,  or should the whole redux box come off of
 the tube ie.  both the cover and the back part that the cover screws on to.
 Bently seems to imply the first method but the second method seems easier?
 
 TIA

well, you have to take the RGBoxes apart to pull the tube.  You can undo 
those side cover bolts and loosen the clamp at the small end of the axle boot 
and slide it back, however.  But as you have to take the RGBoxes apart to 
change the bearings it is only the 6nutss on the axle tube flange at that 
point to pull the axle tubew/inner RGBhalf, so that seems easier.
