Subject: LEAKING TRANNY


I've been trying to locate the source of a tranny leak in my '58 SC
(original split case tranny).  One spot seems to be at the rear most drain
plug.  Are the tranny drain plugs supposed to have a washer like the oil
drain plugs?  Mine do not.  Also when the plug is sufficiently tight, it
seems like there is still a small gap between the head of the plug and the
tranny case...like a gap where a washer would fit perfectly.  Maybe I'm not
tightening it enough... is there a torque specification for the tranny
plug?

Thanks for the help.
