&gt; I wonder what kind of meltdown they'd go into if you took a Bus in
&gt; there?  Nine zerks (to be greased with the wheels off the ground),
&gt; three gear oil places, battery, no oil filter...Make 'em *earn*
&gt; their $19.95!  :)  Bonus points if it takes them more than five
&gt; minutes to figure out how to open the church-key engine lid...

Well, they kinda get confused.  I took my bus next door to the Mr. Lube to
top up my tranny oil because my mechanic was way too busy and I didn't feel
like smelling like gear oil for a week.  I pulled in, they asked me the year
of the van, etc. etc.  for the computer, then the guy spent about 5 minutes
frantically thumbing through a big book before I told him that I didn't want
my oil changed and that there was no oil filter anyway, so he could quit
trying to look it up!  Then when I tried to explain the concept of reduction
boxes, etc. they just gave me confused looks and said &quot;Uh.. we don't do that
kind of thing.&quot;  But they did manage to grease the front end (or so they
tell me.)  Moral: if you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Although it is kind of funny watching the Mr. Lube guys get more and more
confused.

On a related note, when I took my bus for emissions testing the guy there
couldn't figure out how to take the e-brake off.  I had to repeat, several
times: &quot;push the button IN.  Ok, now push the lever forward.&quot;  Somehow that
was an incredibly difficult concept.  And of course they were amazed by the
church key for the gas door.

Happy Friday,
Diana
