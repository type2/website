&gt; So, tonight I will go and adjust the rod length so
&gt; the master cylinder 
&gt; travels the entire stroke and there is about 1/8
&gt; freeplay.

Some of the new master cylinders come with a shallower
depression in the end of the piston.  You MAY have to
pull your push rod out and cut off a little of the
end, and then round it back off.  To see how much too
long the rod is, I usually remove the master cylinder
mounting bolts, and the cylinder will move out the
amount of needed adjustment.
 
&gt; Can anyone explain why the master cylinder only
&gt; releases pressure at the end 
&gt; of travel (i.e. no compression of the cylinder)?  Is
&gt; there some kind of 
&gt; orafice that the piston passes only at this location
&gt; that allows for fluid 
&gt; release?  Just my curiosity getting the best of me!

Yes, you're exactly correct!
