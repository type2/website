Subject: Re: [VB] Schofield sheet metal problem.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi, I have done quite a bit of bus metal
replacement..living in the rust belt of course!

I have heard much ravings (by the person selling the
panels of course!) of Schwofields better fitting
panels.  Well I had a friend buy inner and outer
rockers, floors and doglegs from Schofield.  I must
say I was NOT impressed at all by the stampings and
fit...they were actually below the level of quality I
have seen in some other's panels.

I have found Wolfsburg West's inner and outer rockers,
outriggers and jack points to be very good...the
doglegs are so-so...nose pieces are decent.  their
corners will fit and line up decent but require some
fitting.  But their battery trays absolutey
SUCK...they need tons of re-working.

Seems to me some companies probably make some stuff
better then others.  Of course I have NEVER seen any
after market come close to fit and quality of original
VW metal...and have started replacing pieces with used
sheet metal out of donor buses with smashing results!

Good luck
tds

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Just finished cutting off the lower nose sheet metal
&gt; on my
&gt; 64. I purchased the
&gt; Schofield metal hearing that it is good quality.
&gt; Well. The
&gt; lower piece that fits behind
&gt; the bumper is about 2-1/4&quot; shorter than the original
&gt; piece
&gt; in my bus and it has a lip
&gt; that is supposed to attach to the the lip on the
&gt; upper
&gt; piece. The original lower piece
&gt; fits up behind the nose sheet. The original nose
&gt; sheet has a
&gt; lip at its lower edge. Then
&gt; bent around the lip is another piece that then
&gt; extends
&gt; another 1/2&quot; or so down and is spot
&gt; welded to the face of the lower sheet metal.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the Schofield stuff just doesn't look right.
&gt;  Is the
&gt; Wolfsburg metal a better
&gt; reproduction of the original stampings and foldings?
&gt; 
&gt; Thom, you just did the nose on your bus ( the
&gt; pictures
&gt; encouraged me to finally
&gt; dive in and start the job ). I think you said that
&gt; you used
&gt; Wolfsburg metal and that you
&gt; were happy with it. Is it a repro of the original or
&gt; does it
&gt; just look close when it is
&gt; all welded up?
&gt; 
&gt; Chris.
