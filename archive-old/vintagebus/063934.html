Subject: Re: [VB] Welding trouble

Yea Stan and Steve are both rite in my book on both counts. Butt welding is
talent that you have to really work at to master, and even after 31 yrs it
can still be a *itch  at times. The tack method Steve uses is the way i do
most of my butt welds , the trick is that i can bump the heat up to 2 on the
weldpak and get full penetration with out touching my wire speed for the
most part, i'm not sure where i'm running at on wire speed but i can look
today and let you know .  I'm running .023  wire solid on 75/25 gas, I think
.023 is the smallest you can get at this time. I seldom change the setting
on the 110v welders as i have a big miller 250 for welding the heavy stuff.
Also Stan is very rite, I wear glasses for far sightedness, but i can go
with out except when its dark, then i can't see crap with out them. Old age
has kicked in with fuzzy sight from my face out about 14 inches. I had to
install a correction lense in my shield for that. Life goes on ,,Yell if i
can help
