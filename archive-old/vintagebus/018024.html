subject: albuquerque, nm to monterey, ca (trip report)

it's midnight but don't ask me what day.  my truck and i returned home about half an hour ago.  i left albuquerque yesterday morning about 7 and arrived just as the sun was going down in lake havasu city.  on the way my truck and i endured bitter cold, pouring rain (my truck leaks a lot!) and winds that reduced our travel from 55/60mph to 45.  there was also a headlight switch weirdness that brought on the generator light and acted as a 35mph speed governor any time i tried to flash the big rigs it was okay to get over.

in lake havasu city, i met vwhoward, his wife and their two doggies.  i was given a tour of vwhoward's toy collection, the luxurious trailer they go &quot;camping&quot; in and some of the contents of the garage.  i ate a wonderful home-cooked meal and slept on a bed for the first time in more than a week!  in the morning i went to ronnie's shop and looked at his two barndoors... that is to say i looked at his panel and parts of the deluxe.  his panel is really very nice - solid and complete.  it's got what i think are neat rust streaks running down various areas of its body.  the deluxe is a logo bus but very far gone.  parts from it are going to save 10 barndoors in the u.s. and canada!  ronnie, his wife and i shot the breeze for awhile and t
