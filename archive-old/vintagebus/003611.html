Christmas time is here.

I thought of all the reasons for selling one of the collection, like,
I need the money for one of the other projects...
But I decided the truth was I wanted to sell this one for a pile of cash,
and just fill my bathtub with it and roll around in it for awhile.
Then go buy Christmas presents, go home roll it it some more, then pay off a
credit card and do some more rolling.
