Oh my God, Ronnie, that  sounds kinda funny.  That could be taken the wrong 
way, but I'm just giggling.   Like what am I supposed to do, pretend I am 
male?  I can't help it is most people really into VWs are, I'm just doing my 
thing.  I think that everyone is percieved in this world according to image.  
 And though I too  have been treated like I don't know a VW from a hole in 
the ground on occasions too numerous to remember, or kill bandwidth trying,  
(which can be interesting - I had that same experience when the junkyard guy 
answered my questions to the boyfriend who was actually looking at things on 
the walls and obviously not paying attention one bit)  and have people say 
dumb things ad infinitum, and have people assume I am watching stuff at a 
swap meet for some guy, I did get the impression I got better deals at a 
junkyard.    FWTW.  Geez I would love to get out of town and go on a big 
junkyarding trip in the boonies.  Maybe it's time to quit my job....   I 
would have to take the 61, the 65 is too pretty to be a good junkyarding bus. 
 But it doesn't run.  Anyway, it used to bother me, people's attitudes, and 
the things they would say and do, but rarely does it get to me anymore.  Had 
an interesting discussion with Dawn the other day, in which she said she felt 
like she was in a fishbowl.  It does seem to be a rather small VW community.  
And being as there aren't that many women, it does tend to make us more 
noticable I suppose.  Then again I live in a small town where it seems 
everyone knows what everyone is doing pretty soon, anyone you meet already 
knows people you know, went out with your best friend, or something of that 
sort. Then I am used to that, though I was surprised when I was buying a air 
cleaner support triangle at a Sac show a couple years ago when I heard 
someone say my name, turned around, and this guy I had never seen before in 
my life introduced himself as Gerald (a listee from NoCal) and figured it 
must be me cause not many women would know what an aircleaner support 
triangle was or buy one so odds are it was me and the funny thing was he was 
right.

&lt;&lt; Sounds like a Clara thing, she uses her womenhood to the full extent in
 dealing with buses and/or parts, good to have her in your corner when
 dealing at a swap.

 &gt; Well, this is a note to let those of you on the list that have
 understanding
 &gt; significant others, to let them do your dealing on vehicles.  This weekend
 &gt; my wife bought me a 1966 split deluxe bus and a 1971 bay camper.   &gt;
 &gt; Boy, it sure is nice having a wife that also enjoys the VW adiction as
 much
 &gt; as I do.
 
 Women dealing on vehicles can go both ways. Being a woman, I have also been
 treated by prospective sellers as if I had no clue what I was talking about
 or looking at. One such sale was with my significant other along for the
 ride...I knew more than he about VWs, but the car salesman (yes, it was at a
 dealer) would only look at Matt when speaking, even when responding to a
 question that *I* had posed. Women are more likely to be taken advantage of
 in a sales or repair situation. I try to learn as much about a vehicle as I
 can ahead of time. It helps to be armed with information, whether you are
 male or female!
 
 If only we were all so lucky to have such VW supportive spouses! :-)
 Congrats!
