Subject: Seam sealants

Hi All,

I had to scrape away some of the rubbery seam sealant where the cargo
floor meets the rear wheel wells in order to treat a rust spot.  The
original bead is probably an inch or so wide, I can't really tell if
it was applied with a gun or brush because in some places it's applied
as a fat bead and others it's pretty thin.  Are there any
recommendations for what to replace this stuff with and how to apply
it?

I'm also trying to psyche myself up to replace the passenger rockers
and bottom of the B-pillar this summer.   Is there a sealant or filler
used between the rocker panel and dogleg, or was the joint just
painted over at the factory?  I want to re-create the size and concave
shape of the joints as best I can.

Thanks,
Tristan
