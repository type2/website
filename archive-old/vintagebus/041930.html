&gt; Does anyone subscribe to John Muir's method for unplugging a heat
&gt; riser?  That is heat the carbon with an oxy-acetylene torch until it
&gt; starts to glow then switch to oxygen only.  Anyone know how well this
&gt; works?

I've used this method to clean old 2-stroke exhaust systems, but the
burning carbon made a heck of a lot of smoke and heated the pipe red hot
at the location where it was burning.  A red-hot ring slowly travelled
from one end of the pipe to the other.  It probably oxidized off a bit of
metal as well!

I wouldn't use this method on a dual-port heat riser, but it might work OK
on an all-steel single port riser.  I'm not sure that it would work well
on a riser that is completely blocked, as the oxygen wouldn't flow
through the tube.

Personally, I prefer mechanical methods.  All of my manifolds have an
access holes drilled in a place that allows straight access to the portion
under the carb.  I made a rotary scraper from a length of 1/8 welding rod
that does a pretty good job of cleaning the entire ID of the heat riser.

The problem with using a old speedo cable to snake through the heat riser
is that it doesn't clean the entire ID of the tube.  It'll ream a small
hole, but that hole will close back up pretty quickly.
