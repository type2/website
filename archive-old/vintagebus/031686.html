Wolfsburg West makes the bumpers for the seat backs. They are the only ones
that I know of that have the oblong ones and from what I understand have
just come out with these a while back. As far as the round seat base bumpers
I have a few hundred of those, but none of the oblong ones for the 3 way
adjustable seat.
