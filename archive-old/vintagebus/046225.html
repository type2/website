I have cut two up and i start with removing anything that remotely might be 
needed.
chrome strips, all panels all trims screws ( you never know) seats, glass, 
everything possible.
then i get a black marker and make my marks on the outside as to what pieces 
of metal are good and usable, even if you dont need it someone else might.
i try to keep the corners intackt ,just in case of a rear ender.
and i usualy start with the roof, weather as a whole unit  if its a 21 or 23 
or just the sun roof if its a lesser model.
and i leave the cab section for last cause it will be the hardset to do,if 
your saving the skin or dash.
happy sawzalling.
joe
