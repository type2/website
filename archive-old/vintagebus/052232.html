&lt;&lt; just done know what to do... not too many people to help around here, and 
i 
 dont know if im confident enough to drop the tranny. i have a drum to drum 
big nut, but it grinded a bit when downshifting.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Bob,
Well if you hae a core tranny you have it easy!  Just dissassemble it down to 
a center section and send that to the tranny rebuilder.  Meanwhile you go 
through the axle and brake pieces inspecting, repairing, replacing.  We 
highly suggest drilling, tapping longer mounting holes in the RGBs so you can 
use longer mounting bolts that are far less likely to strip out!  Once you 
get the tranny center section back assemble it back up to the point where you 
are ready to install the brake baking plates.  Take out the engine and old 
tranny, and slide in the newly rebuilt tranny.  Assemble the brakes, install 
the engine and you are ready to go!   Eric&amp;Barb
