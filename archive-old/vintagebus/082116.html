Subject: 356 Pulley

Happy Friday!

Thanks for the recent info on pulleys. I put a 356 generator pulley on 
my 67 EZ camper. The bus now sounds like a Hoover Vacuum. I also 
installed a welded and balanced fan. I definitely didn't want to take a 
chance on fan detonation. It is amazing how much air the engine now 
pushes with the stock crank pulley and the 356 generator pulley. I cant 
wait to see how the temps look when I take my next trip. I selected the 
fan belt by trial and error. I finally ended up with a Gates XL #7340 
(I couldn't find the belt size specified anywhere on the internet so I 
hope this helps someone else). The cheapest place that I found for the 
3pc pulley was www.pap-parts_dot_com. I paid $42.25 which included 
shipping. However, I did have to get the nut and shims from Stoddard 
(10 shims _at_ $1.05 each, nut _at_ $18.64 plus shipping). I hope I have a 
truly 'cool' ride.

Rocky
