I was an advocate for POR15 very strongly in the past.  I used
it and other products from that company to strip my bus to 
bare metal, and then to etch the metal and protect it for almost 18
months before I started to paint.  It is a good bare metal primer
to provide a surface to paint on, not a primer , but a pre-primer.
It comes in 3 colors, clear, black, and silver, according to the 
metal particle content respectively.  By using it over glass cloth
and painting on both sides, you can patch small holes.

The POR actually stands for Paint Over Rust.  The ads say that
you can do exactly that.  But clear metal is suggested.

They do have a web site, search for POR15.

My body guy changed my mind when he got involved.  He knocked
the residue from the zinc phosphor coating off with powder blast and
coated with Rhino Liner, outside and inside floor.  I was a little skeptic
at first, but I was convinced after seeing the results.

POR15 if your patching, Rhino liner if your rebuilding, IMHO.
