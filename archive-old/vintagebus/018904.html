I actually take exception to this statement that mechanics and dealers are the biggest supporters of &quot;clunker laws.&quot; In addition to being a car fanatic - especially our beloved ACVWs - I am a dealer and am in management for one of the largest import auto service centers in western North Carolina. We here, as most service professionals are, are opposed to the rampant &quot;big brother&quot; attitude of  federal and state agencies in removing classic autos from the roads. On the contrary, we support organizations such as SEMA in their opposition and struggle to repeal such nonsensical laws, since they are merely a guise to appease the big money of corporate America, rather than any environmental panacea, as government would have us believe. For example, &quot;clunker laws&quot; pave the way for major polluters to receive &quot;credits&quot; to expel certain amounts of pollutants into the air for every car that they crush. This in my mind is an insult not only to car collectors, but to any American who in con!
cerned about the environment.  I can prove, by using an exhaust gas analyzer, that older cars that can be classified as &quot;clunkers&quot; when well tuned can run as clean or cleaner than some newer cars in poor tune.

As far as inspections go, for the most part here in NC, they are somewhat of a farce. We regularly see cars that are in nowhere near &quot;passing&quot; condition, with new stickers on them. I believe that if they are properly done, they can be a benefit, but few are done that way. We are instructed by our state Division of Motor Vehicles to raise every car in the air and inspect suspension, steering and exhaust systems, as well as tires,  for potential hazards. These components are more of the inspection than is the emissions at this point since only a few areas in NC are classified as emissions areas, requiring the hookup of analyzers for inspection. At this point we are only required in Asheville to verify the existence of emissions control devices on the cars. The real problem is that the state mandates a charge of $8.25 for an inspection, plus $1 for the sticker for non-emission applications. Do do the inspection properly would take more than 30 minutes. Most shops around here char!
ge $50-70 per hour of labor. $8.25 does not begin to cover expenses, resulting in less ethical shops just glancing the car over and putting on a sticker. Hence the farce. South Carolina recently repealed annual inspections, and we have supported either doing the same in NC, or revising the system to make it uniform and practical.

Just my two cents, but it is too easy to vilify automotive professionals, when most of us are collectors ourselves and we are on the same side.
