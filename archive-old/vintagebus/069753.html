&gt; Hey ppl.  When I had my bus redone, I decided to not reinstall the old
&gt; antenna and had the holes filled.  Now I want to have a hidden modern radio

&gt; am just looking around for a decent antenna to mount under the dash or in
&gt; the back somewhere, maybe even inside the door?

Looked at many modern cars lately?  Most of them have external antennas.
Some have antennas in the windshield glass, but this doesn't work as well
as a good external antenna.  Laws of physics, y'know.
