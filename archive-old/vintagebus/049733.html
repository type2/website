If I remember right, Mr. Heard sent you mail once, berating you for
something-or-other. You probably deserved it. 8) Maybe you should try to
get his email address from the way kewl new archive and invite him here to
defend himself as best he can and addrdess whether the $10K rumor is true.

If (as often alleged) SOTO's expenses do not include publishing the
promised newsletters then their only expenses would be promotional, and
much of that may be got free from the T&amp;A magazine...$10K might be a
bargain for a cash machine like that. 8)
