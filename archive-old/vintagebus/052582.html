Subject: Getting in touch with Michael Steke?

Does anyone know how i can get ahold of Michael Steke
(SP?)in Germany?  There is a picture of his 65 Deluxe
in one of my VW books that i would like to ask a few
questions about.  Specifically, i would like to ask
him about his tow hitch electrical connections.

thanks
Matthew
