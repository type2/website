I finally installed the tach in my bus, VDO Street Eliminator, to see how my
driving habits were and to see what RPM's I usually run/drive at. The
results were a lot different then I expected. So here we go.

Using my regular driving habit I found that I run the engine up to 4900 rpm
in first and second, 4500 rpm in 3rd and when going to 4th it drops to 2500
or less. How can this be?

I have a Rancho 3.88 (R/P) trans with stock 1st and 2nd gears. Third gear is
a 1.21 and 4th is a .77. using big nut RGB's.

The engine is a 1776, counterweighted crank, fully balanced and blueprinted
(all rods, pistons were fully balanced, pin heights and deck matched, etc.).
I have New single port heads with 40 mm intake and 35.5 exhaust valves
(Manley), high rev springs with chromoly retainers and keepers, stock rocker
shafts and arms with Elephant feet adjusters and chromoly pushrods. Valves
are set at 0. The CAM is a custom grind done by CB Performance to work with
this engine. Cards are duel Kadrons with 145 mains and 60 Air correction
jets. Still a little fat on the mains and will change to 140's next time I
have the engine out.

Now for the RPM and speed specs;
1st gear:      4900 at 20 mph
2nd gear      4900 rpm at 40mph
3rd gear       4500 rpm at 60mph     also 4800 rpm at 65mph
4th gear       2500 rpm at 55 mph
4th gear       3200 rpm at 70mph

The engine has plenty of power in all gears but will fall off in 4th on an
incline, but it appears that I am at the optimum cooling RPM at my preferred
cruising speed of 70 mph.

I am presently building a new engine to try, that is the reason for the Tach
and soon to be installed gauges. This is being done so that I can monitor
the engine to speed to temps to help get a better understanding in helping
me build the optimum bus engine.

The new engine is a 1800. This is being done by using a 74 stroke crank and
88 cut ins, the cylinders on these are as thick as stock 40 hp P/L. On this
engine though I am going to use New Duel Port heads with 40 mm intakes and
35.5 exhaust and again the Duel Kadrons until the NEW FACTORY DUEL SOLEX
carbs arrive in the country. These carbs are what are installed on the late
model upright Brasilia buses and are finally being imported into this
country (carbs, not buses) so I have been informed. This engine should be
installed by my Red Barn/ Kelly Park trip next month, so if you see me there
ask me how it worked.
