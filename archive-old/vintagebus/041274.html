This is exactly the problem I had in my bus (reads empty when empty, but
only 1/2 full when full). Check you rgas guage and see if it is 12v or 6v.
I saw these symptoms with a 6v guage in a 12v car. If it is a 6v guage,
you'll need to add a voltage drop circuit before the guage. If you want a
schematic of the circuit, let me know.

&gt; Hello again,
&gt;    I am still having problems with somthing that seems so easy.  This
&gt; gauge thing.  There's only the sender and the gauge that can go wrong.
&gt; My sender is a new float kind with the arm that floats up and down.  My
&gt; old one is the tube kind with the internal float.  Would it matter which
&gt; one of these is used.  How can they break (what part of it can break
&gt; down)?  They both seem to work, but when both are used with the two
&gt; different gauges(one new, one old) they both read reverse and only half
&gt; full.  They do work within this range though.(giving me a broad idea
&gt; about my gas situation).  Has ANYONE gone through all this?    My bus is
&gt; a 67 and it is 12v.  Are gas gauges different throughout the years, and
&gt; why so?  I'm sick of being on a date and jumping out in the middle of
&gt; the evening  to shake my whole bus and the people insided just to hear
&gt; if I have any gas.  Jeez.  Any help?   Anyone know a good site to search
&gt; for used parts for old busses?  Online junk yards etc.?   There's not a
&gt; whole lot here in Hawaii.   Thanks  ---J
