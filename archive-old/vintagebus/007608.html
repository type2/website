I hope that this an appropriate &quot;Friday&quot; topic for the list. Yesterday as I
was driving to an appointment I spied the front-end of a bus poking out of
the neighbors garage. As I got closer I saw a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in the window
and stopped to see what it was. Much to my surprise it was a Doublecab and
within my price range. It's a 68 and has 3 stressed ribs over the back
window. Is this a factory DC or a Binz DC?
TIA
