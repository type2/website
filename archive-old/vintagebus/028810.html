Baaaa Haaaa  LOL!  That is sooo ironic.  VH1 just ran a rock 'n roll
movie special last night and in it was a 2 minute section on Arlo and
his band of merry dumpers and draft avoiders.  The red micro was all
over it.  I've never seen the movie (Alice's restaurant massacree), but
you can bet I'm going to go and find it. The micro bus was chartreuse in
the film though.  Its not just for Thanksgiving ya know.

Somewhere on the net I've seen pictures of Arlo (present day) standing
next to the bus.  Good to see it still lives...same color too.

Now where did I leave that draft card anyway?

&gt; A microbus (variation thereof) loaded with stuff for

&gt;
&gt; I suggest going to the dump anyway. No one will know
&gt; or care...
&gt;
&gt; At risk of revealing age let me add~
&gt; &quot;You can get anything you want at Ellis' restaurant&quot;
&gt; Watch out for Officer Oppie and 8x10 color glossies
&gt; with the arrows and descriptions on the back...
