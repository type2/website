I too have used the bang on the top method.  Only with the nut unscrewed so it is level with the top of the shaft, and banging tends to break it loose.   I have also used a propane torch (PNW rust glue), and the cold water shock treatment and penetrating oil.   This may, however, temper the shaft, and I have been warned it could break the key or somesuch, but that has not happened to me.   

The problem I see with banging from underneath is the damage to the steering wheel.  As usually when I remove a steering wheel I would like to not mess it up, and that method can break pieces off the metal core of the wheel.

Would like to try pullers sometime and see how that works.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; The problem with this method is that you more often than not ruin a perfectly 
&gt; good steering column by mashing the threads, and the tube that makes up the 
&gt; shaft.  If you have to use a hammer use it with a piece of 2x4 laid flat 
&gt; under the arm of the steering wheel and pound up with the hammer.  Moving 
&gt; often the wood, and hammer from arm to arm.  The biggest problem why the 
&gt; steering column stick to the steering wheel is that they are machined with a 
&gt; taper fit that practicly glues them together.  Eric&amp;Barb
