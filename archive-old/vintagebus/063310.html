Subject: Re: [VB] new aftermarket crankshat pulley

&gt;a larger pulley, I would imagine that this would casue the generator
&gt;to produce more power...as it would then spin faster. right?

As has been noted, the generator would produce more power, but the
regulator would keep the output relatively constant.  Having a bigger
engine/generator pulley ratio would help a little, because generators
have to be turning some minimum RPM to work, and the bigger ratio
would get the generator to that point quicker.  Mostly it would help
on short trips or in heavy traffic when you start, stop, and idle a
lot.

Per Bentley T-1 2, the generator:crankshaft ratio is about 1.8:1.
Putting this with the various generator information we have:

Generator Speeds
            6 V       12 V
Cut-in   1350-1850  1800-1850
Nominal  1700-2600  3550-3880

Engine Speeds  
            6 V       12 V
Cut-in    750-1030  1000-1030
Nominal   950-1450  1970-2110

With the engine turning at 3600 RPM, the generator will be turning at
6480 RPM.  This is anywhere from 3.81 to 1.67 times the nominal
generator speed.  Obviously, the generators can take this as designed.

Assuming that the &quot;big&quot; pulley boosts the ratio to 2:1 (about 12%),
this turns into:

Engine Speeds  
            6 V       12 V
Cut-in    680- 930   900- 930
Nominal   850- 730  1780-1940

So, charging starts closer to idle.  The 12% boost bumps up all
the other numbers, too: 7200 RPM generator at 3600 RPM engine,
and means the generator is turning at 4.24 to 1.86 times its
nominal value.

A scrap of semi-related info: Bus 1500 engines get their HP peak 
at 4000-4200 RPM, and their torque peak at about 2600 RPM, per
&quot;Without Guesswork&quot;.

Here's a question for the older^Wmore experienced listees - back in
the day, when they were brand new, did Buses have a lot of trouble
with overheating in the mountains or in the desert southwest US?
(I was -6 when the last splitty came off the line.  Don't hit me.)
I realize that VW did improve the cooling system over the years, but
the stock system worked OK when new, right?
