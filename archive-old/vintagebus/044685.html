&lt;&lt; 
 But the recent threads on hauling &amp; towing made me wonder, if buses are rated
 for such stupendous loads, why is towing verboten?  Seems to me to be the
same 
 burden, whether pulled or carried.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
The pre-1968 bus was rated for 1600Lbs. till 1964 and till 1967 2,000Lbs.,
this load mostly ends up between the front and rear wheels.  In towing the
load is behind the bus and because of this if you use the brakes while towing,
the load wants to push the rear two wheels to one side or the other.  This is
bad even when traveling in a straight line and much worse if you are on a
curve, the more the curve the worse the problem.  We have towed a bus with a
bus and it is very nerve racking!!!  Suggest keeping the wieght down to
1200Lbs or less for towing.  Still watch those curves and turn speeds!!
Otherwise enjoy tempting jack knifing on the road!!    Eric &amp; Barb
