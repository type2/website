Hi Volks,

We returned from our extended EB vacation about 4 hours ago. Knowing
the vagaries of the yahoo group mail I'll spell it out: We pulled up
in front of the house at 4:38AM.

Toronto - Greensboro is not a drive I will attempt in a single pass
ever again. We were slowed down a bit by weather in upper PA, and by
a minor shift linkage issue in upper WV.  It would have been a much
easier drive if I had gone to bed at a reasonable hour the night
before, but I didn't do that and you can't please all the people all
the time and there's no-one else to blame for me burning the candle
at both ends but me so I should just stop whining. Ahem.

Kooky math:
Awesome weather + Good Friends + High Drama   =  Magnificent vacation.

A public note to Jamie Auch, Chris Cybulski, Jason Laster &amp; Adam
Narraway:
I am holding you guys directly responsible for one of my best
vacations EVER. Thanks, dudes. And thanks also to all the many other
sneaky b_at_stards who had a hand in it... I was quite effectively blind-
sided. Apparently there were a lot of people in that game and I just
hope that next time it's played they'll let me join in.

I am burning out the thesaurus looking for the favorable adjectives;
so I'll just close with the news that the full trip report is going
to take a few days, so please be patient.

I'll probably write a teaser report tonight and will try to get that
out tomorrow. If someone could forward this to type2, FMBC and the
sneaky b_at_stards list in the meanwhile it would be appreciated.

&quot;Happy trails&quot; is a monstrous understatement, but it will suffice for
the time being. If you'll excuse me now I have to go do some laundry.
