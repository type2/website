Hey everybody,

I've been trying to get my '62 standard on the road and I've hit a snag,
after doing a tune up: valves, points, timing, carb adjustment all per Muir
with new parts, the bus was still running really  rich (black smoke, black
plugs) I
figured the carb could use a rebuild so I bought a kit and rebuilt the carb
following
the instructions in HVW Nov, '98. Put it all back together- same problem--
rechecked valves, points, timing. No dice. So now I'm figuring I might as
well replace the carb so I know it's not the problem. I can't find a PICT
28,
but the guy at the local VW FLAPS says I can stick a PICT 30 on there and
disconnect the 12v choke; to the tune of 140.00. I really want to get my bus
on
the road so I'm willing to part with the dinero, but I want to be sure this
is really
the best thing to do; any ideas?

I had a 28 pict on my 59 bus and got 31 mpg, though I can't credit
specifically the carb really, could have been a number of factors.     If
your bus is 6V, you can switch the 6V choke over to the replacement carb.
You could also probably pick up a used carb at a swap meet for significantly
less than $140.   Check to see the arm  the acc. cable moves isn't woggly or
it could do bad things like leak gas.    Are all your parts there?   The
little U shaped thingy made of brass that the gas squirts out of when you
pull the accelerator arm fell off my carb and made it running kinda off.
Gets stuck into the top of the bottom part of the carb and aims the gas down
the carbs throut.  mine ate it.   yum?

Also, was this running rich a sudden problem, or has it always done this, or
gradually  started doing this?

Clara
