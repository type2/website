&quot;Only after the above has been done can you suspect the headlight
switch. When pulled out to the first click, terminals 57, 58, 
and 58b should all be powered. When pulled out to the second
click, 56, 57, 58, and 58b should all be powered. If this isn't
so with your switch, it is probably &quot;

**********
not sure if i agree with you on this one...shouldn't there be a difference
between first click and second click that you missed...at the first click you
front 'parking lights' come on. at the second click the front parking lights
go out, and the front headlights come on.
by 'parking lights' i mean the small single bulb on the side of the headlight
bucket. So if a light goes out between first and second click, wouldn't there
be one less lead powered. sorry i know i just redid one of these switches a
couple weeks ago, but i don't remember exactly how it went together....
