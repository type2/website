Subject: My &quot;crank&quot; dimensions...yuk, yuk...

Hi Lee,

Happy Holidays to all of you British Bus guys and gals!  I happen to have a
#211 012 301 Bus crank-start handle in my hands so in an effort to give you a
little something for Christmas, I'll try to give you some dimensions from my
original crank-start handle.

Hollow tubing outer diameter:  20 mm
Hollow tubing wall thickness:  about 2.5 mm thick
At the &quot;starter dog&quot; bolt end, the tubing is drilled for a cross pipe/pin that
catches on the two curved teeth of the &quot;starter dog&quot; bolt.  The solid cross
pipe/pin is 39 mm long and it's outer diameter is 9 mm.  The &quot;centerline&quot; of
the hole drilled through the hollow tubing of the crank is exactly 11 mm from
the end of the crank handle, and of course the inner diameter of the hole you
drill for the pin would be 9 mm thick to make it a snug fit for the 9 mm cross
pipe/pin.
Length of the tubing that runs horizontally away from your motor through the
apron and out to the first bend:  from the end of the tube (that fits into the
&quot;starter dog&quot; bolt that holds your crank pulley on) to the vertical tubing is
300 mm (allows the crank to clear your ribbed bumper without scratching it).
Length of the vertical tubing:  200 mm
Length of the &quot;handle&quot; area from the verticle tubing to the end of the handle:
165 mm

I assume you've seen on of these before.  It was originally made of one long
straight tube bent in a press into a crank handle.  I hope this helps you (as
well as others) out!

Merry Christmas!
