After having such bad luck once again with rebuilt parts messed-up in
USA, in this case the front spindles, I have decided to do it myself.

The spindles to be rebuilt are the 63 to 67 kind with the larger kingpin
and linkpin diameter.

After pressing apart the kinpins (I surprisingly noticed I have the
special VW/MATRA support tool to do that most easily) I found that the
main reason for the exessive play was not wear on the bushings, but rust
on the kingpins themselves. Obviously water got in (they were never
greased) and corroded the pin. Pits and wear are so deep that a
regrinding seems useless (I am sure that rebuilders have no such
hesitations).

Initially I thought that the bushings were pressed in and then reamed
with a giuded reamer to the required size. While this is described in my
11/62 VW repairmanual, it is no longer the method used sometime after
1963.

The bushings are now pressed in using a tool guaranteeing alignment. No
reaming is necessary. These bushings are rolled, meaning they have a
seam. Unfortunately I do not have this tool or a picture of it. I will
make myself a suitable selfguiding press-in-pin, but would really be
interested what the original looks like. Anybody have a picture? Willing
to FAX maybe?

All parts for the kingpin repair are still available as original VW
parts, because they were produced until 1975 (?) in Brazil. I was in
Guatemala recently (with my 72 Westy), and Guatemala imported German,
Mexican and Brazilian Busses (corner windows, small hatch, cargo doors -
cool). The local VW dealer had the parts in stock, but they would have
busted my budget. In the US the parts are hard to get and quite
expensive too.

So if anybody has some stuff floating around, even if its just bushings,
please drop me a p-mail.
