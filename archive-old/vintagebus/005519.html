Maybe this has been mentioned before but would it be possible to have a
Safari window setup which is modernized?  By this I mean where you have just
plain smoked glass with no frame but it has holes in it for fittings so you
have a latch and hinges fastened right to the glass.  It would be kind of
like the glass on a lot of modern moon roofs in cars.  It seems to me this
could be done a lot cheaper and easier than the factory type of safari.

Has anyone tried this?
