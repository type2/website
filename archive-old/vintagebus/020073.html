-----------
It should be understood that this piece by it's nature
is typically worn, scuffed/damaged by years of
constant foot traffic. I found marginal success by
having one polished via professional high speed
industrial polisher. The polishing, in my case, took
most of the nicks and relative minor scrapes. Major
deterioration via weather etching and bends, cracks
cannot of course be &quot;polished out&quot;. Pick the best that
you can and move on. We might assume that there is
some high volume industrial wholesale source who
should have similar substitution.
Sometimes it's this supposedly extremely hard to find
stuff that is surprisingly easy if looking in the
right place. 
An example is the beat to heck electrical outlet with
cover as was on the '67 camper. During the resto
process Billion dollar paint job was completed and I
was anticipating installation of what?- a nasty
looking elect cover with FUBAR electrical plugs
inside? Thought of restoring it until I found the very
exact perfectly identical replacement for $10 +/- at
my local RV supplier. I have that Manufacturer/part
info if anyone needs it.
