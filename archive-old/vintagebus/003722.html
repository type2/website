&gt; now) to add an oil pressure gauge as well, but what else? And how hard are
&gt; these to hook up for your average up and coming bus doctor? Also, my gas

Brad,
    I always put a temp. pressure and volts guage. Volts is better than amps
as it tells you that your battery is on the way out before it actually
fails.
Other guages....
If your bum cant feel things put in a tacho
