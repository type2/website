 Ya know, I am gonna incurr such a wrath for saying this, but *nothing* on a
 bus should cost that much (save for engine, paint or body work).  I've been
 writing an article on my beef with eBay...how it's artificially inflated
 the prices on the used parts market, but I realise now that you don't
 always need eBay to get outrageous prices.  Before anyone starts, I'm not
 trying to pick on tds here.  I've seen these senseless price blowups
 before.  I know this is going to start such a loooong thread (and I better
 check email from school today) but if company X is selling safaris for,
 say, $300, then what about original safaris makes them worth the extra
 $100-300?  I'm not saying people don't have a right to try to get what they
 can for parts, I just want to understand the logic behind it.
  &gt;&gt;
the reason the originals are worth more is that they are better quality.

complaints I have heard about repros are that the 

frames flex and the glass cracks (have seen this  happen)
latches break
frames don't fit properly onto the bus
leakage of water

complaints I have heard about originals

leakage of water
incomplete sets - needing to find bits-harder to find


the bottom line is are you bothered by the lower quality of the repops?   or 
can you deal?   I sold a set of need to be restored originals for more than 
the $400 most repops cost.   Why?   Because they are better quality, and if 
you are willing to spend $400 on anew set of repop safaris that is an 
unneeded accessory, why not spend a little more on quality?  And if I wasn't 
going to get that sort of price, seeing as I spent more than I should have on 
a POS 65 westy I wanted to fix and drive (it was a good candidate for my idea 
of a daily driver, in spite of the safaris) just because of those 
windsheilds, I'd have kept them and maybe restored them and put them in the 
bus later.   Then again some people would rather not spend the extra bucks 
and some are happy with the repops, some are not.  I mean, you dont need 
them, like you need good steering or good brakes.
