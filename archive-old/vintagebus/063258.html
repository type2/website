It sounds like you have bug tires.  That probably means bug rims.  165s
might fit but real bus tires I think will hit in the back as the offset is
different on bus rims.  Especially with adaptors.  You can get some good
strong tires for the 14&quot; bus rims.  195s work well.
The 165 tires are usually pretty weak for a bus, but I've seen lots of
people use them.
