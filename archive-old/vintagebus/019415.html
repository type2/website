Subject: gas researve lever part wanted
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have an extra gas tank reserve lever arm
they would like to sell?  I have the valve and the
cable but do not have the lever arm or whatever is
used to attach it to the valve.  I could also use the
clamp for the cable at the vavle end.  Any help would
be apreciated.

Matthew
