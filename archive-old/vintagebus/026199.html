Subject: [VB] '65 last night. Need axle
Message-ID: &lt;382C5FED.EA669D81_at_fibertel_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

Well here is the short version.  I need to an axle for my '65 standard
as mine is busted.  Please let me know price and shipping, I'm in San
Diego.

Here is the long version of my escapades getting the axle out.  I should
also mention, that the axle was busted when I found the bus.

Thanks,
A

A couple of days ago I pulled the tranny in an attempt to get the busted
axle out. I set up two rows of 2x4's for the jack to roll on, as well to
raise it up high enough to reach the tranny.  After unbolting the the
reduction boxes and the tranny from it's mounts, it was real easy to
just roll back on the 2 x 4's.  Well then, last night, I tackled the
reduction box to get at the axle.  I mounted it back to the spring
plate, as I had already separated it from the tranny.  (comes out real
easy when it's busted, undo the plate and THUD, there it is) In the
latest SV2's news letter, there is a very detailed article about how to
get in the redux box and things to watch for.  I unbolted the outer case
half and with the help of a now very chewed up wire brush handle, got it
off.  Pulled the axle snap ring, and according to the article, the
bearing and gear just come right off.  Yeah maybe in happy land.  Mine
weren't going anywhere with me pulling on them, and the space between
the two was too small for the three prong puller to work, so then as any
two shade tree mechanic would, I broke out a short piece of 2x4 and the
BFH and went to town.  Slowly but surely the axle moved its way out up
to the point that it was flush with the bearing.  What the heck do I do
now?  No wooden dowels around.  Didn't really want to screw up the
busted axle, as someday I may need to know how to do this cleanly when I
replace bearings in the RB.  That's when I noticed that the center of
the axle is threaded.  Are they all threaded?  So if I find a bolt that
will go in there, I'll be all good.  With all this talk about RB spring
plate bolts, I tried it first.  No luck.  Then I went to a jar of
miscellaneous and pulled an extra brake star and slotted bolt from the
jar.  As it happens this one threaded right in there!!!!!!!!!.  This is
a handy note for the road side RB bearing replace.  With a couple bangs
with the BFH on the 2x4, the bearing and gear came right off.  Cool.

So now with the busted axle out, I NEED a new one, (oh and WANT a pair
of original safaris)...sorry couldn't resist.  So my plea begins, anyone
have an axle they would part with?

Thanks,
Aaron
'65 with parts scattered everywhere on the floor right now.
