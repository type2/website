I can agree on the using their logo without their permission on websites,
and what not.  But to confiscate, and ban parts with their logo that THEY
DON'T EVEN MAKE ANYMORE?!? I don't think that they should be able to ban any
parts that have their logo on them unless VWoA actually makes a similar part
or replacement.

My 2 cents

&gt; not to play devil's advocate, and those of you who know me know i'm
against
&gt; carcking down, but hey, they are in business and it IS THEIR logo.  think
&gt; of it as plaigarism to an author,like napster to metallica. wouldn't you
be
&gt; upset if someone used your name/logo to make money hand over fist?
&gt; granted, website url's is stretching a bit far, but it's now a cut-throat
&gt; money-grubbing world, and they need to protect all aspects of their
&gt; trademark.  maybe a thing to do would be to write a LETTER on PAPER
&gt; (remember how?) to vw explaining your viewpoint to them, rather than just
&gt; internalizing it on a discussion list, and see what the have to say.
