&lt;&lt; I had problems getting it into reverse at first and the seller told me

Now I lost 4th gear.
 :-(  So I am going to change the bushing and hope it is not the trans. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
The 1959 and earlier front shift linkage do not use a plastic bushing.  
Instead that area is all metal to do the same function.  The rear shift tube 
in non-barndoor has two plastic bushings.  What probably is wrong is either 
the rear flex shift coupler is spliting and/or the coupler bolts just forward 
of the tranny and/or where the front and rear shift rods meet in the forward 
coupler are loosening.  You need to slide under there NOW, take a look to 
figure out if you need to replace the rear flex shift coupler or at the least 
tighten either or both of the coupler bolts, and safety wire each so the wire 
tightens each bolt.  Otherwise expect to have no shifting all of the sudden 
in traffic.  BTDT  
Get the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67 soonest!
