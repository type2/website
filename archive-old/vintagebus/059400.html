Subject: Re: [VB] How about the toughest descent you ever drove?

Old Priest grade shouldn't and hopefully never will be shut down. 
That is the greatest steep road ever. I've been up it so many times 
(unfortunately not in my bus), but it's definately a vehicle killer. Seen 
many dead going up and down the hill.
One of the reasons they're trying to close it is because of the accidental 
deaths that occur when someone drives off the side. It's a steep drop off and 
most people don't live to see another day.

On a side not; The Split Bus Club and myself will be making the trip this 
July up that same hill for a campout in the Yosemite Valley. Campsites are 
reserved and we're all ready to go. Should be fun, with the exception of the 
bears scavanging around peoples stuff. Hopefully everyone brings bear boxes 
and keeps them away from our VW's.

Bug-O-Rama is right around the corner.
See everyone there.
