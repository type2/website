&gt; The CHT has the spark plug mount.  Does this give an accurate reading?  Is 
&gt; the
&gt; #3 the norm cyl.  for mounting?  are there alternitives?

Hi Tom,
We do not like mounting the sender under the spark plug because it will be 
damaged from taking out the spark plug for normal maintance.  We have been 
plotting on welding on a mounting stud onto the head near #3 spark plug as 
possible.

 &gt;   What are the normal operating temps / pressure for these guages?
&gt; 
Oil temp is best if you can keep it between 160 and 220F, over 230F and you 
start smoking the oil.  As for oil pressure it depends on Wt of oil and outside 
temps, but best to have 20+ PSI at idle and run 30-50 PSI at 3,000 RPM.  When 
outside and engine temps are cold it is easy to push oil pressure well over 
80 PSI in the first few minutes and this should be avoided to prevent blowing a 
seal or swelling/blowing a cooler!!!
