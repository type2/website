Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Question

Right.  FWIW, I don't think (and I *will* be corrected if I'm wrong on this)
there was a different center section for a bus.  I think they were 113
center sections, with just the R&amp;P flipped and a different nose cone.

Go to http://vintagebus_dot_com/docs/5867part/223.png and you'll see the case has
a 113 part #

&gt; No, actually you can take a bug center section, reverse the R&amp;P, and stick
&gt; the bus axle tubes on it and run it in a bus. Rebuilt center sections that
&gt; are &quot;supposedly&quot; for a bus are sometimes sold this way.
&gt; 
&gt; I already know that the used trans came out of a bus. What I don't know is
&gt; whether it has a bus center section or a bug center section with a reversed
&gt; R&amp;P.
