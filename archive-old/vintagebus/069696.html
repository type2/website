Subject: Re: [VB] first drive single port dog house

&gt; &gt; The Dual Port doghouse thermostat rod runs differently through the heads  than the Single Port heads, does
anyone have that answer?

&gt; Hi MUD,
 ;-)  The only parts for DH flaps differant from non-DH shroud is the linkage between the flaps.  Make sure
you are threading the rod through the correct hole (Into the outer, is how we remember.) in the 1&amp;2 head and
that the curved arm the upper rod attaches through is not bent too close to the flaps. There should be about a
popcicle stick width of space there!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addtion to the connecting bar, there is a difference in the right flap where the loop is for the rod to
attach to. The position of the loop on the DH flap is wrong to align with any hole in a single port head.
If you have a non-DH right flap and a DH right flap, put them side by side and look at the loops.
