Subject: Re: [VB] Axle paint marks Tranny replacement 

I haven't seen any left/right markings, but I have seen coloured paint dots 
on th axles.  This has something to do with size or tolerances.  It says what 
teh colours been in the bentley.  i suspect that one of your axles was 
replaced at some points.  As everything tends to be well worn out of spec I 
ignore the paint dots.  

Often it is good to flip the axles from sid eto side, so the unworn side will 
push forward.  Often this has already been done.

I have seen NOS axle shafts FS for about $250 each.   I didn't want them THAT 
much.

 &gt; OK, but why are the axles marked with paint for L/R?  I mean I know
 &gt; they're the same part, but I was assuming I needed to keep all the parts
 &gt; from each side together.  Just curious.
