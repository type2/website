Subject: Re: [VB] Need Single cab

&gt; A good friend of mine in the Phoenix and/or AridZona
&gt; area, is looking for a
&gt; Single Cab

I was going to write this up in a trip report of my
Thanksgiving Albuquerque to LA and back trip, but
thought since someone was looking...

I saw a singlecab for sale about 25 miles south of
Ronnie's shop in Lake Havasu on my way back from LA
yesterday.  It was yellow, 1958, cut wheel wells,
incorrect front bumper, no rear bumper, white spoke
(Jackman?) wheels.  Said &quot;new engine and tires&quot; in the
window.  He's asking $2750.  The phone number was
520-667-4886.  I think Ronnie is familiar with the
truck, and somebody from Havasu could maybe look at it
for you.

I might have been interested, but I just got two new
(to me) singlecabs in the last few weeks!
