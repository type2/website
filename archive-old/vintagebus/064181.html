Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height.

The rear torsion bars definitely sag with age/wear. I had a '66 bus in 1970 and it sagged in the
rear. I reset them to spec and it still sagged. Had to add a click to make it right.

Maybe ibusses that carry heavy loads for a period of time cause the rear bars to sag prematurely.

Steel springs do not 'settle' unless they are overstressed and the metal
deforms (elastic limit is exceeded). I would think that the VW engineers
designed the torsion bars to take infinite life (or close to it), so you
should be able to bottom out either the front or rear without exceeding the
elastic limit, therefore sag should not happen. (Theory is nice until
reality sets in. What a concept.)
