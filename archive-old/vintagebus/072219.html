&gt; I'm gonna root through my parts stash this evening, but if anyone has a 
&gt; pair of correct-length wiper arms they're willing to part with, please let me 
&gt; know via p-mail.  I need the type with the pinch bolt at the base -- supposedly 
&gt; fits all buses up to 67. 

Hi Joe,
You might want to just take some late model bug or bus arms with the hook 
ends and cut/weld them to the length you need and that way you can use 
inexpensive bug wiper blades.  Otherwise if your bus arm bases are in good shape you can 
cut off the later arms and grind/file them to fit the early bus wiper arm 
bases.
