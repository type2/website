I was actually talking about the trailing arm bushings in the beam, not the
link pins, but the link pin sets I get out of Brazil for the 64 and above
still have the needle bearings.

 Clara, E+B, where's the books when you need them &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
Pretty sure you are corrcect!  Our APR58 bus shop parts book does not go
into 
detail about the earlier front beam.  Recently we inquired about new link 
pins for 1964-67 bus from a fellow in Brazil.  Turns out they use a brass 
bushing not the expensive long lasting needle bearings we are used to!
