&lt;&lt;Her tax id is her Social Security Number. &gt;&gt;

Hard to believe, but in CA sellers must carry a resale permit.  Different
number altogether.

&lt;&lt;The funny thing is, since
we live in New York, only people accepting shipments within this state have
to pay.&gt;&gt;

The issue lies with New York taxation.  A state can only collect a sales tax
on items which are sold in the state.  If the basket by mom was purchased
out of state, New York cannot collect tax, so your wife doesn't have to
collect.
