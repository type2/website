Subject: Re: [VB] what happens without the engine lid?

I think if it was a good idea to have an exposed
engine in order for it to run cooler VW would have
done it! The problem as i see it would be hot exhaust
getting sucked back into the engine compartment
especially at idle. VW fans push/pull a LOT of air. I
think the air would be hotter were it to come from
closer to the asphalt rather than from the stock air
vents on a bus or bug.
Drag cars aren't daily drivers and are only used in
1/4 mile srtaight shots. Most racers remove the fan
belts before a race , if they had one to begin with.
Usually a lid left of is to show off a motor, keep
yours on!
