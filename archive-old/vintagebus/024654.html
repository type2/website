I never meet Josh.  But I was looking forward to seeing him
at BBB3 next year.  Never mind he probably was going to be
bringing me seats for my bus.  I just wanted to meet some of
the people on the list that shared my interests in the VW
Micro Bus.  It is sad to her of his passing.  I pray for his
family.
