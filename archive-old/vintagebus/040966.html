Enjoy your vacation.  Wasnt there a big civil war battle at Harper's Ferry
or was that where John Browne (the abolishionist) dug in?  (he fought the
law and the law won) :-)

I will be visiting freinds in Hannover this summer and I dont have to tell
you guys what the Hannover VW plant produces.  ;-)  I wonder if they have
tours.  I was in Wolfsburg a couple of years ago and that tour was quite
worthwhile.  Perhaps I can locate some Hannover licence plates (German
plates all start with the initials of the domicile town or city) for my
&quot;Bulli&quot; pickup.

Hey y'all
Today we are heading out in the Burrito Express for 10 days of forced
togetherness (I mean vacation).  It's not a complete vacation since my
ulterrior motive is job and house hunting.  We'll be leaving Charleston,
proceeding up 176 to 26 to 77 to 81 and north to Martinsburg Wv.  We'll be
camping at the Harpers Ferry KOA (has pool for kids) if any listees in the
area care to drop by for an evening.

If you see an off white Dormobile heading that way, wave at us, please use
all your fingers though!

Hope to see many of you at High Country Bus Fest.  This year will be
especially good since the Full Moon Bus Club is making breakfast Saturday!

Mad Uncle Dave
