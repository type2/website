Subject: Let's go over this here clutch problem...

Well this afternoon I finished my fence in the backyard so that I can keep
the 66 bus around for parts and move them over to the 67.  There are a lot
of little things are broke/missing on the 67 and since the 66 was so
complete, I'm just gonna move a few parts over like the rear hatch with
jailbars and VW logo and then the headlights will get moved over, etc.

Now back to the 67 - I put the rear end on jackstands tonight and had the
engine out in about 45 minutes.  One yank and out it came - really impressed
the neighbor kids. :-)  Once the engine was free of the bus, I started in on
it - I pulled the carb and manifolds and redid all the manifold/heatriser
gaskets, boots, etc.  The carb is sitting in the carb cleaner can soaking
away.  Then I pulled the gunky stock dizzy and put in a good 009 I had
laying around.  I threw in a new set of points as well as a new cap and
rotor.  All the valves were adjusted dead on at .006!!!  According to all
the paper work that Judith gave me, she put on 20,000 miles on the bus since
she had it and her dad had rebuilt an engine for it during that time so this
1600DP doesn't have anything over that on it.  The comrpession is tight and
snappy (when turning by hand with a wrench).  The oil was awfully dirty
though so I need to make sure that I do a drain and change soon after
starting it up.  Originally, I thought this was an HO case but something was
blocking my view (can't remember what) and the case is actually an
AH0xxxxx - the paper work confirms that it was rebuilt in 1991 in Davenport,
IA so all in all, I've got a good stock powerplant ready to go putting
around with until I get my 1776 done.

Getting on topic here - when I pulled the engine, I caught waft after waft
of a burnt smell - really nasty and sure enough - in the bottom of the
tranny bellhousing was a bunch of ball bearings.  The release bearing clips
were both broke as well.  Of the 2 arms in the tranny, the release bearing
was sitting IN FRONT OF (FIF) the left arm but still in it's cradle on the
right arm.  The face of the bearing was a triangular piece of metal on top
of a ring (really scored bad!).  The innards of the bearing were shelled -
the bearings were BONE dry and rust had formed on the balls.  Now according
to Judith, she had this problem and had it repaired - 40 miles later, it
happened again so she paid a guy to repair it.  40 miles later it happened
again so she parked it.  I need to make sure that this doesn't happen to ME
within 40 miles.

I'll be seriously reading all replies to this one...

Now can you guys and gals please tell me what I need to look for?  I notice
there is a little bit of play between the cross shaft and the gizmo that the
clutch cable hooks to.  The spring on the tranny is rusty but not broken.
The cross shaft and arms are in good shape (no broken welds.)  The release
bearing and pressure plate look like the right pair but I'm gonna put mine
in just in case.  What other things can I check for that are directly
related to this failure of the release bearing ? The tranny is your standard
1967 bus tranny with an input shaft and seal but no nosecose for a release
bearing to slide on like you find on the later beetle trannies.

I'm gonna head out and replace the clutch and pressure plate as well as
check the corrolation between the cross arm shaft and the thing the clutch
cable hooks to.  Oh and one more thing - when viewing the cross shaft arms
in relation to the input shaft of the trans, it appears that it is slightly
off center (the cross shaft seems to float a little bit side to side in the
trans.)

Thanks for reading and mucho THANKS for the help!!!
