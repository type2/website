Yes, low fluid will cause difficult shifting.  And low fluid
will wear the tranny faster.

In the 60, the trannny only has 7000 miles on it, but when I got it,
both boots were torn badly, and it was almost empty.  I'll bet it was
driven quite a ways like that.  The tranny has some awful noises
in it, but shifts beautifully...

&gt; low transmission fluid and 2 do you think that the transmission has been
&gt; damaged because of  a low fluid level.
