&gt; Ooops.  That .006 I wrote should have been .060!  I meant to have said I
&gt; shimmed the cylinders 60 thousandths...not 6 ten thousandths!  The engine is
&gt; .120 wider.  Not much, but that is the only thing I can think of for the tin
&gt; miss fit.  In all other respects the cylinder cover tin fits like it
&gt; should.  Tight against the exhaust ports and the attachment screw hole
&gt; around the intake hole are in the proper spot.

I'd expect the tin to have a 1/16 gap at the case but otherwise to be OK.
There should be enough tolerance built into the attachments to the front
and rear tins to absorb 1/16 inch per side.  The ends of the fan shroud
might have a small gap as well, but the tin is flexible there.

Still, you're the man on the spot, so look carefully for other alignment
problems that might exist.  I spend quite a bit of time on tin, and often
loosen and twiddle bits of it to get it all happily in place.
