Subject: tranny leaking gear oil
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey.
Good news is, the huge oil slick which forms under
DARTHVW when parked overnight is not engine oil.
The bad news is, it's tranny gear oil. The drops are
coming from the bottom-most nut on the passenger's
side  sideplate.

It leaks about 4 tablespoons in a 24-hour period from
gravity alone. It looks like the mounts on the frame
block a lot of the nuts there for me to get in and
wrench 'em down, but I took a brief look.

The tranny is from transform. PO had it installed
around '94 but it only has about 2000 miles on it.

Any suggestions? Do I really have to pull the engine
and trans to get in there? Is this a rare problem?

Thanks
Jason
