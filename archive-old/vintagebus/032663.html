Subject: RE: [VB] Help!  Brakes lock up!

sounds like bad hoses to me.  i've experienced this once and have seen it
many times.  replace them all.  it's not worth the aggravation just to do
one and then have another lock up on you.  also make sure you have the
correct freeplay in the master cylinder pushrod where it goes into the
master cylinder. if it doesn't fully release, it will maintain pressure on
the entire system.  ususally the brake lights will stay on if this is the
problem, rather than the hoses being at fault.

&gt;   When you press on the brake pedal it 
&gt; becomes stiffer and stiffer to press.   Also the brakes at the wheel
don't 
&gt; release pressure after you have let up on the brake pedal.  This
continues 
&gt; for a few pedal pumps until the brakes are completely locked up.   Then
when 
&gt; you go to one of the wheel and open the bleeder port the brakes release. 
I 
&gt; have removed the master cylinder and that moves freely.  What else could 
&gt; cause the brake system to not releave pressure when you take your foot
off 
&gt; the pedal.
&gt; 
&gt; I heard once that it could be the flexible lines by the wheel ends
swelling 
&gt; and not releiving pressure.   Is this possible?
