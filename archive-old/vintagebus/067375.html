Granted, this is not a vehicle for a driver who makes long trips, but it
makes a great commuter to and from work and for errands on the weekend.  The
upside of recharging is that it is cheap, $1.50 for those 49 miles, and even
including the cost of battery replacement, still cheaper than the 18 mpg
that I got on gasoline.  Additionally, refueling, although time cosuming, is
unmanned.  You plug it in and walk away and forget it.  It charges while I'm
at work and at home overnight.  It can also plug in anywhere.  Nearly every
building has an electric outlet and every place that I have ever charged it,
has allowed me to plug in for free.  One benefit of the electric motor is
extremely low maintenance.  No oil, plugs, filters, valve adjustments etc,
just one set of brushes that should last 50,000 miles and cost $60.  I could
have built it for less money, but wanted to do a first rate conversion.  The
batteries were a big chunk of that cost.  You have to look at it as
prepaying your fuel bill.  There are cheaper batteries available, but I went
for the no maintenance non venting variety.  For an in town vehicle, its
been a pleasure. Still cheaper than a new subcompact and way cooler!  BTW,
other than a few small holes, no permanent modifications were made to the
bus 


&gt;&gt; Nice workmanship though!
