Hey! Are we still gonna do this one by Harry Houck?

Here's my little list:
A trip/fuel journal
A large flathead screwdriver to open the fuel door with (church key
    doesn't fit--anyone know what does?)
A coupla' Bug Jam fliers and a show entry ticket (&quot;Instead of the
    Parking Lot&quot; class)
A ziploc full of gas receipts
A  AAA Plus card and cellphone (don't laugh! we're not mechanically
    adept yet and would like to be rescued if anything ever happens!
:-)

That's it for me! Can't wait to see what kinda stuff you guys keep in
there!!! Happy Friday!
