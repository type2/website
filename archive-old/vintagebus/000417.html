&lt;&lt; &lt; Hello all,
  What is the story on those reflectors that go above the rear tail lights?

 If they are the ones I am thinking of, they are small and galss and below 
the taillights.   barndoors came with them  (early bds just one ).  And post 
barndoor brakelight decklid non semaphore 
 buses  (thus through part of april 57) also had them.   Buses with round 
glass taillights 
 that were also brakelights did not have reflectors.  The post barndoor 
brakelight decklid semaphore buses did not come with the reflectors, they 
have the glass taillights with the bezel attached and screws inside the 
engine compartement, rather than a plastci version.
 
 unfortunately, original ones are pricey
