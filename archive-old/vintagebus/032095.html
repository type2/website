In preparation for my 66 bus &quot;renewal&quot; project, I'm wanting to replace some

major parts with brand new ones.  I'm wanting to have a nice solid driver,

just as good as my 74 Super, with the intent of going places and doing

things.  So right off the bat, I want a new front beam,

the beam?    don't bother, unless yours is rusted out, and get a used beam
with good steering parts on it.   Wolfgang Int.  in Redding does spindles
(king an dlink pins).   Find where your steering play is- you may just need
tie rods or a drag link, or swing lever kit, which are available new at more
VW suppliers than spindles.   A 66 came with an anti sway bar- is yours still
there?

new steering box,

I know Wolfgang rebuilds them.  I don't know if anyone else does or if you can
find them new.   (please post any info anyone- I would like to hear they are
available new)


and following the suggestion of a kind listee, I'm gonna get a swingaxle

tranny made with 74 Super gearing and leave the redux boxes on for the

ground clearance and added durability.

a number of people will rebuild trannies with the 3.875 Ring and Pinion, and a
bus  (.82) 4th gear.  Costs more than a stock rebuld (more complicated to
assemble parts etc)but you go a bit faster.
