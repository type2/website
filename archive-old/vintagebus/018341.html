&gt; did a very admirable thing by selling the seat to you at a &quot;fair&quot; price.

&gt; Why should it not sell for big bucks? Obviously this person wanted that
&gt; seat BAD !

My comment was not directed at the seller in the auction...  it was 
directed at the bidders...  they were either &quot;bigshot&quot; resellers or 
even worse, they were people who asked the seller what the reserve 
was and bid just under the reserve so they could &quot;look&quot; like bigshots 
ready to buy the rarest of the rare.  The egos and &quot;my d*ck is 
bigger than yours&quot; part of the VW bus scene really detracts from 
most people's enjoyment...

Anyone who thinks this particular auction was anything less than a 
joke has no sense of humor.  The bigger joke however is all the people 
who see these auction prices and then believe that is the &quot;going rate&quot; 
for goods and the asking prices at swap meets keep climbing and 
climbing.

Jokes CAN be funny...  but the whole &quot;buying/selling&quot; scene has been 
f*cking hilarious the last few years.  Enjoy things while you can, 
things are going to get worse before they get better.
