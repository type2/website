Subject: Door Hinge Pin Replacement?

Hello List,

Has anyone ever had to fix/replace the pin in the door hinges?  I have a 61 
panel that the lower door hinge pin is broken.  The top one is fine and 
would like to leave that one alone.  Is there any easy way to get the old 
pin out without drilling it out?  Where do you find a replacement pin?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Mike
