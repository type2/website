Subject: Welder recomendations????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Alright....I have NEVER welded before.
Anyone thinking Im not capable or gonna screw up this pretty 
singlecab...needs to come hand me money before I use it as a guinny pig!

Truck needs a left rocker....inner is nice and solid but outter is kinda 
crispy.
I believe that truck rockers are a little bit shorter or longer than bus 
ones....so the replacement ones need to be chopped/extended accordingly.
Am I right? Do they make &quot;truck only&quot; rockers? Or are they all the same?

Who is the best supplier? Ronnie...how is you're stuff?

O.K......and what kind of welder do I need to buy? MIG? Any suggestions......
Think I can do this???
Come on...vote of confidence would be nice.
Anyone want ot come show me how its done...Los Angeles area??????

Truck also needs the brackets on the edges of the front bumper 
replaced.....as the PO cut them off! I guess they didnt look too well with 
the 2X4 front bumper.

Also need to do misc. minor welding at the decklid and side belly door hinges 
as they have the typical minor cracks........

Thanks for any info.
Regards, Greg
