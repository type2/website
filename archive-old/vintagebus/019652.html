Subject: gas smell around valve covers
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id HAA77803

just doing a tuneup, oil change etc yesterday, and I noticed that when I
pulled the valve covers off there was a smell of gas...i don't recall ever
sensing this smell before, any ideas what this means?

I also noted while checking the gap, the piece i think is called the rocker,
could move if i tried to move it with my hand...i thought that this should not
be able to move freely...am i mistaken

thanks for any info on this...
