Subject: Wiring Harness

I have recently purchased a 65 Splitty - looking for information on wiring
harnesses - either to make my own or purchase one, not sure which is best -
Also wondering about changing out the fuse box to a more updated one.  Any
suggestions, experiences or comments would be appreciated.  The bus has
already converted to 12V and the gas gauge is inop.  Thanks!

 

Jim
