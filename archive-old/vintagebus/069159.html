Subject: GEAR SHIFTING

I've been diving my bus for quite sometime now and I never had a chance to
drive another.  My friend finally let me drive his for a while and I
immediately noticed that his was much easier to drive?  Especially the
shifting?  We both have pretty much the same years mine 61 &amp; his 60.  Which
mine is newer however we both have big nit transmission.  Please advise
Thank You
Michael
