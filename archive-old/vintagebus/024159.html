&gt;I have to question the &quot;most original bus on the planet&quot; - doesn't
&gt;hamill have a '58 dd with something like $500 miles?  Doesn't
&gt;Hornbekcers deluxeonly have a few thousand?

There is a super nice 57 standard in North Carolina with 5604 miles on it.   
I got to see it and take pictures of it last year.  Talk about nice, it was 
like a time machine taking me back into the 50's.  
way cool and super original to say the least.
