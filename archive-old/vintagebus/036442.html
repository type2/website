Gotta be behind the seat!
A guy who used to be in my club did this with his lowered base thumping 58 
singlecab.
Some weird thing behind the seat.
I DON'T think it would have fit in a regular split bus.
Singlecabs have some extra room back there behind the seat.

In the bootleg compartment?  Behind the seat?  In the treasure chest?
