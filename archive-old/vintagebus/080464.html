Hi Josh,
Make sure you have not overfilled the oil or you risk blowing out the 
flywheel seal and oil soaking the clutch.  There are two lines cut into the dipstick 
and you want the oil level to be between them and closer to the upper line the 
better.  Make sure to check oil on as level ground as possible when the 
engine has been turned off for at least ten minutes or about 1 quart of oil is 
draining out of the cooler and adding oil at that time will cause overfill 
situation.
