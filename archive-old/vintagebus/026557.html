Subject: [VB] Thrust cut? quick-check...
Message-ID: &lt;386046F8.50222FF6_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

NQ...

    I just checked a couple of cases in the garage (one &quot;AH&quot;, and one &quot;vw
factory reman symbol, H&quot;), *neither* of which has had the thrust surface cut...
from inside to outside thrust surfaces, I miked it at 0.865&quot;, tightly. Using
the ratchet on the end of the micrometer, I got closer to 0.867&quot;, but with more
slop than I felt appropriate.
    Take a measurement of your case and compare to the above... with a little
subtraction you'll find out which cut the thrust surface received, and thus by
process of elimination what the main bearing saddles received...
    Probably wouldn't hurt to bolt the case together sans innards and use a set
of telescoping gauges to check the cut on the mains, too... figure up how much
bearing crush you'll have, etc, etc... ;)

later...

&gt; I had a question on my engine case.  It's stamped 60/80 and I've totally
&gt; forgotten whether this refers to the thrust/bore or bore/thrust.  I need to
&gt; get ahold of some main bearings and would like to get the right ones.  I
&gt; asked this before but can't find the email.
