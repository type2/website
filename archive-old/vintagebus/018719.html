&gt; make shipping arrangements,I don't know what he expets to happen 
&gt; but I made it clear that the bus needed to be picked up within 30 
&gt; days after the sale.I also informed him that he will need to pay 
&gt; storage per day after that..but still nothing and he now owes over 
&gt; $500 in storage...what should I do next???-cameron
