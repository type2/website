hey all,
I was in the garage going through my license plate collection and I was
thinking that all of you could help .  I have been collecting license plate
since i was seven and i have quite a few but i am always looking for more to
add to my collection . I will gladly send back the cost of shipping for any
plate that some one would mail to me from any where !!  and if you want
something in return I will gladly trade you a plate from my home state of
Ohio
Please help for I am trying to enhance my collection and all of you could
help I would appreciate it .#1 most wanted LICENSE PLATE IS FROM ALASKA does
any one from up north have a extra for a fellow busser  ????  thank you very
much
