&gt;I was wondering if there is an alternative turn signal switch/assembly
&gt;available for our busses?

You can get a &quot;universal&quot; turn signal switch that straps around the
steering column.  I put one of these on a Ford fire truck whose
original switch was either NLA or prohibitively expensive.  The
&quot;universal&quot; cost about $50 at NAPA.

&gt;Except the brake light switch that runs through there, I have no
&gt;idea if that poses an issue?

I remember it had wires for each corner and a flash input wire.
I believe it had a separate wire for the pilot light, and I *think*
it also had a brake-light wire.  If you wanted to use it on a
vehicle with separate orange turn signals at each corner (like
a Euro-spec Bus), you tied the brake-light and flash-input wires
together.  But if you wanted to use it for combined brake/turn
in the back (like our Buses), you used the two wires separately.

I do remember that the pilot light was between the flasher output
and ground, not between the flasher output and B+ as is stock on
a Bus.  You can probably wire around this, and maybe even get 
the original speedometer indicator arrow working too.  The switch
also had a lever you could pull out for hazards.  It has no 
connection to the inside of the steering column, so it can't cancel
itself when you go around a corner - you have to remember to turn
it off yourself.  You still need an external flasher...either 
the stock Bus one or an aftermarket part would work fine.

It had about a foot or two so of wire on it, which would be enough to
run under the dash and connect to the original places on the Bus.
I would recommend putting push-ons on the wire ends so it becomes
a straight plug-in to the Bus harness, so if you do find a good
stock turn signal switch later, it's easy to go back.

I hope this helps!
