In a message dated 98-08-10 09:44:58 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 I noticed that thing rims have a different offset than bus rims.
 
 The Thing rims move the tire further out from the axel.
 I was wondering if putting thing rims on the rear of the bus would
 increase the stability in crosswinds
 or if there is a compellilng reason not to do this.  Looks like they
 would fit.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Markus,
Thing rims probably do not move the tires out much, but the farther out you
move the tires outward the more often the bearings will wear out.  Instead
have you tried tires with stiffer sidewalls and/or checked your shocks?  Also
you should get one of the stock front anti-sway bars for your bus if you do
not have one already.  Eric &amp; Barb
