Wolfgang imports his stuff now (Schofield) from England and I will again by
the summer of 2001.

ps. Alans shop is a 3 man operation that does nothing but fab parts 14 or
more hours a day, as Thom said it is difficult for him to ship small orders,
but order a complete bus (in pieces) and he would probably ship it.

The problem is in shipping onesy-twosey stuff.  From talking to him
on the phone, he seems to be set up better for fab than for retail.  It's
easier for him to send a big package of stuff to one place than a bazillion
little packages.  Yes, it would be ideal if he had a nice online system, but
it doesn't look like he's there yet.
