&gt; Hey, what ever it is, I think it looks pretty cool.  Its a shame that he
had
&gt; to chop up a bus though (obviously), but the front (I think) looks cool
&gt;
yeah i think its pretty cool too - wheelbase is so short it'll turn on a
penny with the front wheels off the ground - i'd love to rip the beach up
with it.
maybe one day - he let me buy it.

fwiw - the front (body wise) is a ford thames lorry front. it uses the front
running gear from the camper - chassis is chopped down - but retains the
rear torsion and shocks from 54 camper, beetle box and axles tho - the
gearbox and reduction boxes are safe in my garage - so is the engine.

loads of other bits and pieces -engine and rear chassis with lever shocks
etc from a second barn door that they brok up - this time their 54 ish panel
van are being looked after by me  - so i'm a happy bunny out of this.
