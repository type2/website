Subject: Insiders look at GEX

GEX buys a lot of seconds from my suppliers. When a pallet of pistons and
liners get dropped, GEX buys them, also all returned hard parts, as my
supplier can't resale opened items, this includes rod,cam amd main bearing
sets. Once when I was at my suppliers warehouse there where a couple of
pallets of these seconds and damaged goods destined for GEX, I had noticed
that there was a box on the pallet with a shipping label from me! These were
all the damaged parts that I had returned that were damaged in numerous
different shippments to me which included oil pumps, numerous bearing sets,
new camshafts, P/L sets that had broken fins. From what I understand is that
GEX just groups these parts in bins and will used different runs of P/L,
bearings etc. to assembly engines, it a roll of the dice but some of there
engines will last and some won't. It's a crap shoot I wouldn't want to risk.

ronnie     just my opinion
