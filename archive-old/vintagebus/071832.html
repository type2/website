&gt; I am having extreme issues with my 66 popping out of gear.  Where do I 
&gt; start to look?

Hi Frank,
First check the tranny for gear oil level.  If it is low you probably have 
damaged your tranny!  Next you can try adjusting the shifter, but if it is 
popping out of only one gear then it sounds like it is rebuilt tranny time.
