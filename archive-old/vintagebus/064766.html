&gt; I think I found the original middle seat and front seat, but they are just

Hi AJ,
The problem with just sandblasting is the springs will rerust up and even 
before rerusting they will squeak with every bump in the road.  Of course if 
you have a squeaky bed springs at home this might act as a Pavlov style 
aphrodisiac while driving around!  If not best to have the springs 
sandblasted or better yet acid dipped (Which will get into places sand never 
will!) and zinc plated.  Then cosmolene for both rust protection and sticky 
lubricant.
