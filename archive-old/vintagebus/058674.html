Subject: RE: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Boo-hoo......., I am just lame.  I insured my 60 doublecab last spring so I 
could drive it.  I drove it to the Sac show on memorial weekend and thats it 
for the last year.  I parked it in my driveway all summer (3 mo.) without 
moving it an inch.  Stupid, sat in the sun and caused my wood for my 
canvasless tilt to get bleached and same with the wood on my original westy 
rack.  Its in the garage now for the winter as I hate rust.  Still keep it 
insured as I am afraid I will catch the garage on fire as I shoot sparks 
from grinding and welding the vert.  I will paint it again this summer.  I 
think I like working on them more than anything else..........  seriously. 
By the time one is done, one of the other three will need redone.  Never 
ending story and I am happy.

&gt;
&gt;all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it
&gt;politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following
&gt;poll:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;how many of you actually DRIVE your bus
&gt;DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT 
&gt;a
&gt;
&gt;honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot;
&gt;excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.
&gt;
&gt;no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my
&gt;busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called making
&gt;the
&gt;heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned
&gt;to go
&gt;to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses
&gt;didn't
&gt;rust out.
&gt;
&gt;no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of
&gt;miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i don't even own any other kind of car, so what
&gt;else WOULD i drive?!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i'm just curious.
