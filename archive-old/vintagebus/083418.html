Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel question 15&quot; vs. 14&quot; on my 1963

From Detroit Bus:

 **after writing most of this message, I double-checked my Bentley
 manual. Page B-11 states that the 1 ton capacity transporters were
 fitted with 14&quot; tires and the 3/4 ton with 15&quot; (prior to December
 1963). So apparently I have a 1 ton vehicle, not surprising since its
 a commercial. The same questions remain, however: what are the
 implications if I go to a 15&quot; wheel? I much prefer a narrower look and
 I will not be hauling around 2000lbs worth of anything. Is this
 possible, or do I have to replace more than just the rims?

 Head spinning along with my wheels...

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you believe you have a 1 tonner because a previous owner put 15&quot; wheels on it??

There is more to it than that.

Do you have a 1500 emblem on the rear? [I don't believe there were any 1200 1 tonners?]

Do you have M code M 215?  [THAT is the M code for 1500 engine AND 1 ton]

What is the ratio marked on the back of your speedometer?!!!!!
A bus that used 15&quot; wheels will have W0,77 stamped on the back.
A bus that used 14&quot; wheels will have W0,80 stamped on the back.
It will be stamped into the back of the speedo. The blue paint number is the build date.


After writing the above, I decided to check the www.type2_dot_com archives and found these after doing a search on
'1 ton':

This post says &quot;5 Aug 1963    1 144 303: 1 ton version available&quot;
which is WAY past your vin of  1 077 700!

And this one makes it sound like you are supposed to have 15&quot; wheels, no ifs, ands, or buts :
