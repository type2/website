Subject: Measuring linkpin shims - Idiot guide is good
Date: Tue, 18 Apr 2000 21:54:08 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Thanks to all of you who offered, I was able to actually read the Muir Idiot
guide at 9:50p.m. and finally understand how to measure the offset so I know
how many shims to use.  The Muir book does an EXCELLENT job of showing how
to measure the gap properly for the alignment and even includes a chart
similar to Bentley.  I appreciate those of you who offered to send me
photo-copies of the reference chart but it's simply not needed as I already
have these 2 references.  I guess tomorrow night I can start measuring and
assembling.


Bonus Note:
The reason I wasn't able to read the Muir book sooner was due to a very busy
day at work and an incident where a guy paid me on a COD lumber delivery
with a counterfeit check (printed on a computer AND on a closed account.)  I
ended up driving to Lincoln 2 times of which the 2nd time was for the re-po
job.  I started loading the lumber back on my truck when the gal who told me
she was only the babysitter, decided to fess up and pay me the $345.69 and
then shorted me $10.  Oh well, once a scam artist, always a scam artist.
The adrenalin rush was well worth it!
