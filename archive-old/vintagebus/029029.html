Subject: Engine Knocking compared to Muir sounds

I visited the Muir sounds page at:

http://www.volks_dot_net/muir/index.htm

My engine sounds like either the loose valves or the cam noise sound
bites. I'll have to adjust the valves and see if the sound is still
there. It doesn't sound like the example there for loose rod. And it
doesn't sound like a broken camshaft. So we'll see. I have to
unfortunatly admit that it really seems like from memory that it sounds
MORE like the example for cam noise, which he says reflects a loose cam
gear or badly worn cam bearings.

so what's the general consensus on these sounds he made available. They
seemed to help me a lot. If they're OK, I know what pinging is exactly
now! Any input on any of this appreciated. Thanks.
