Subject: The 1967 bus engine.

Tonight I worked feverishly to get the 1600DP engine out of the 67 running.
I had it purring like clockwork for a few seconds off the gas I put in the
carb. but the fuel pump refused to pump any fuel so it's probably bad.
While I was standing over the engine, I realized the generator was sticking
way out forwards of the crank pulley by a considerable and concernable
amount.  Turns out this engine had the 38Amp bus generator with bug backing
plate.  I scrounged up a bus backing plate I had with another 38amp
generator on it.  It was a tight fit but I managed to get it installed
without pulling the carb/fan shround/etc. only to find out that the
generator bottoms out on the fan.  I think the fan for this generator is
also a bit narrower to make up for the intrusion into the shroud so I'm
gonna have to pull the generator back off and replace the fan.  It's amazing
that P.O. drove the bus like this for 20,000 and to my knowledge, never
threw a belt.  Anyway, for the brief moment that the engine ran (with my
little o.p. idiot light installed!), it sounded nice and quiet - no nasty
knocking noises or anything like that...
