well,
I should be going to pick up my bus in a week or so and I have a couple of
questions. I got a bus tow bar from the fellow in Arizona so I'm all set
there, I was wondering if there is a problem towing the bus at highway speeds
( 65-75). I don't know how the reduction boxes will act at that speed. As long
as the trans is in nuetral should there be any problems ? I have to pick the
bus up in Virginia and tow it back to Michigan ( 600-650 miles).

Thanks, Dan
