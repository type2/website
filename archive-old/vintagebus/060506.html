Subject: Re: [VB] rubber snubber clearance?

I have never checked the clearance on the snubbers.  There is some.   there 
started being used in late 64 or early 65.  small nut and early big nut boxes 
don't have the mounts for them.   Some times they rust off.  Dunno if it 
makes much differnce (anyone gonna test this?)    they are an anti bounce and 
jolt thing.   You can get them in various colours in pet stores as a dog toy 
called a Kong, the label on the dog chew toy says they were inspired by a VW 
bus part.

I have no idea what the original ride should be like.   I like the KYB GR-2 
ride. I have the gas a just shock on the back of my 65, and the gr-2 all 
around ride in my 61 is better- both 1 ton all around.  not too stiff, not 
too squishy.   Haven't tried new Boges.

 Alright. I've got the rear transaxle all dialed-in in
 DARTHVW. (completely stock, 67 with GRB's, stock
 height, as far as I know)
 
 So I look under there, and the two rear rubber
 snubbers(?) (those black rubber snowman things
 sticking up from the axle tubes) are almost touching
 the metal dish above them. There is less than 1/4 inch
 clearance between the top of the snubber and the metal
 dish.
 
 .....
 OnE more thing:
 I put on four new BOGE shocks, advertised as &quot;OEM for
 an original ride&quot; what is an original ride? spngy?
 stiff? I wasn't even an embryo when my bus was made,
 so it's not like I remember the ride.
