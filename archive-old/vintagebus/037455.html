As far as painting on chrome, it can be done. . . but its a lot of work I've 
been told.  You have to really scuff up the chrome and it takes a ton of 
sanding to get the caps to look good.  I'd just buy primed ones and try to 
trade/ sell the others.  Or keep them for later.  Who knows when you'll be 
getting a bus that doesn't have any.  It seems buying them primed would save 
you a lot of time.  

As far a learning techniques and stuff, try a local community college.  Take 
a class or two in body work.  Either that or try to find a friendly local 
paint shop that will talk to you and maybe even help out with choices of 
tools and materials.
