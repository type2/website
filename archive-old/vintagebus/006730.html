Subject: type 1 verses 3 and 4 oil coolers
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 13:31:42 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After looking at the 3 different oil coolers I have decided to use a type 3
instead of the type 1 or 4. Why you wonder???  In close examiantion of the
3,the type 3 seems like the best canditate to enhance cooling power. Same
size as a type 1 so you won't be loosing air volume or air flow, like if you
were using the (type 4) larger cooler, the hoover bit will still work, makes
for better sealing, no hacking of existing sheet metal and the type 3 oil
cooler has at least 30 per cent more cooling fins then the type 1 and would
seem to cool oil down as good as or close to the type 4 cooler. In off road
racing the coolers we used  have more cooling fins then they do passages
(and these are high dollar coolers) as did Porsche,and are a lot amaller
then the big tubed, less finned coolers, so size isn't everything, The type
4 have 2 more rows then the type one but the same size cooling fins, whereas
the type 3 has the same passages as the type 1 but at least 30 per cent more
cooling fins, so I feel this would make up for the extra passages, but lack
of extra cooling fins in the type 4 cooler. Another plus is the addition of
a sender unit boss in it so you could hook up either a pressure or temp
gauge, again this is my opinion but common sense seems to take hold here,
I'll let the list know the effects of this as my 1776 single port is almost
complete.

ps. used brand new stock rocker arms with 9 mm adjusting screws with
elephant feet instead of the Autocraft 1.25 ratio rockers. will switch to
the autocrafts after a few thousand miles, so I will be able to tell if
there is a difference that warrants the extra cost of ratio rockers.
