Subject: door handle springs

Hi again list

So it is cold here in Central Canada like most of you just would not
understand.  My door looks were not working - frozen I guess, so I took
apart the drivers door and somehow I just can't remember how that silly
spring goes in.  I got it back together and it works - but something is
wrong.  The handle itself doesn't go in close to the body like it does on
the passenger side - it sort of sticks out at a wierd angle.  I can push it
in and it sits properly when I do that but I have to push it in for it to
stay parellel with the body and not sticking out it some angle.  It's a
problem because I'm sure that I will hook my self on it someday.  I think
it's just the spring that is in wrong - but I fooled with it for an hour and
I could only get it to go in one way ...... hmmmmm

Well, list again
TIA
