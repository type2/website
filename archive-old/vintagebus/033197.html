&lt;&lt; I read recently in an online &quot;RV&quot; newsletter that a company is now 
marketing
 new teardrop trailers &gt;&gt;

Try http://members.tripod_dot_com/mac_bilt/route66_1.htm

That's one company that makes teardrop trailers.  There are a few places to 
get plans to make one your self.  They'd be the perfect size to tow behind a 
bus.  The owner of this company left a business card with an offer to buy my 
1946 Kit teardrop trailer, but I traded it for my '61 Flipseat Westy.
