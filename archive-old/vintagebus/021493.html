   I feel the urge to chime in on this thread. It all started when my
mothers niebors started getting upset by my broken down 66 b*g in the
yard. I was 17 years old and had a restored thing,the 66, and a 68
westy. The niebors went to the county about my 66 bug in our yard and
said it was an eyesore (in hindsight it really was) and demanded action
be taken. The county butification dpt. came to the house to scope things
out. After they decided that I must either put my bug indoors or get rid
of it, they  noticed the very large oil puddle under my westy. The
county butification dpt. called the ohio state office of the EPA. This
was now a very bad situation. the fine for a leaky bus engine was over
$25,000 and three months in prison. The case was dropped when I went to
court, praise God, but I have learned a valuable lesson, make sure you
make an effort to keep the oil inside your bus engine, and keep receipts
they are admissible in court. My receipts for valve cover gaskets and
push rod tube seals showed the judge that I made an effort to correct
the situation, and saved my butt.

65 standard (Bernice)
73 thing (Rosane)

P.S. While the EPA folks were investigating me they checked out the
niebors that started this all and found problems at their house too.
They did not fare as well in court.-----Treat others as you would like
to be treated!!
