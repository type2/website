Subject: Re: [VB] Spare Tire hold down.

There is a U shaped clamp and a wingnut to hold the rim down on the
threaded rod. They are Black hardware, the U has a hole in it to go over
the rod, hit the rim, and is secured by the wingnut.
Took me a WHILE to find a pair.
AL

&gt; Does anyone know what the device looks like that holds the spare tire in
&gt; place on a non-walk thru Bus?
