&lt;&lt; Well, I am the high bidder. But I am certain that I cant afford the
 reserve.  &gt;&gt;

I think the reserve is fair.  Haven't been to a California show in about four 
years but my understanding of the market price places my reserve at a 
reasonable level.  Don't want to publicly thrash anyone's bus but based on 
the $4000 '54 on the VW Planet (www.thesamba_dot_com) mine is a steal at the 
reserve.
 
&lt;&lt; Why place the starting bid so far below the reserve? &gt;&gt;

Interest.
