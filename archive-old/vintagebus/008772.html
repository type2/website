Subject: Friday - TDI Passatt

Friday topic.....

As gas prices inch upwords I was just toying with the idea of replacing my
daily driver F**d with something cheaper (gas-wise). Passatt would be nice -
if it would have TDI in it.. but nope, not here in the US.... only Jetta and
Beetle.... anybody have any idea if it at all be coming to the US soon??
Jetta is OK but it's too small, family of four + dog..... need a wagon.....
I know, I know, bus would be nice...... wish VW would make diesel available
in every model.

BTW I just visited VW web site, they're running special feature on a new
Microbus.....

Anyway, just me....
