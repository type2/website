Unless Izzys is claiming they have 49 locations in every state but AZ., they

&lt;&lt;&gt;Ok...I just got my safari's from California.  As I
&gt;look at the bill, I see that I was charged $35 on a
&gt;$425 order.  When I called up Izz, I was told they
&gt;must charge everyone tax, unless shipped to AZ.  I've
&gt;never paid out of state tax before in my life over
&gt;mail order.  Whats the story?

You've been had.  Demand a refund of the sales tax.
