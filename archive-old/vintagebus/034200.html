If it took you 30 minutes, it would take ronnie 35 and me 186.  Actually I
think it took me about 45... but I had Tristan do most of it, I just had to
explain to her what it meant. &lt;grin&gt;.

Yup.  Wait as long as possible to bid, unless you're bidding on one
of *my* auctions... :)

&gt; Anyway, I purchased my welder about a year ago... the same one for sale on
&gt; E-Bay.   The Weldpak 100 isn't a bad deal, but you do have to convert it
to
&gt; MIG gas -- which isn't trivial.  I later found that Costco had a setup
that

Took me about 1/2 hour to do mine.  You can buy them pre-converted
at Sierra Airgas in Sacramento
