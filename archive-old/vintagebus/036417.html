&lt;&lt; I've heared alot about rockers and the rust they sometimes encounter.  I 
have recently purchased a 66 vw bus and would like to know where these 
rockers are located. &gt;&gt;
Hi James,
Rockers are the curved outer sheet metal just below the cargo door opening, 
and on the lower opposite side on the usual non-cargo side of the bus.  You 
should look into your dog legs under the front doors.  These also rust out 
over time and are much harder to fix/replace.  At the very least running 
water though these and making sure all dust/rust/gunk is out of them, and not 
blocking thier drain holes is a must once a year.  Possibly spraying a layer 
of tar into these after a good dry spell would help greatly.  We have been 
tarring the lower halfs of the interiors of the front doors to prevent 
rusting out there with great results.   Eric&amp;Barb
