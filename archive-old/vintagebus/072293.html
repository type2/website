Subject: Re: [VB] headliner questions

how warm is it?  Perhaps a bit more heat would make the vinyl more stretchy

I remember someone saying get a bug headliner and practice installing it 
(like in a junkyard car) as they are cheap.  
Is what youre saying is that it's better to start from the front of the bus 
and work backwards?

 Trying to put in my headliner in a 13 window deluxe. I was hoping that
 somebody on this list has done this, i'm screwing up every way possible, I
 think I got sold a headliner that was just too damn small. Well anyways here
