In a message dated 98-12-17 14:45:43 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; at  40 to 50 degrees, which is about what we get here these days,    There
is
 noticable thermostat icing soon upon start up until the engine warms enough
 for the preheat to eliminate that.    Thermostats make the engine warm
faster. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Also when the engine oil does not get up to at least 160F the fuel does not
atomize properly.  It makes it's way past the rings which washes the oil off
of them reducing the ring and cylinder lifespan.  Gasoline causes the oil to
break down into acid.  Which is why with even a well running and compleat
engine you should at least change oil every 6 months or 3,000 miles which ever
comes first.  For the engine that is run in town/seldom and/or without the
thermostat every 3 months.   At the same time water which is a by product of
burning hydrocarbons (Gas), gets past the rings and begins to turn the oil
into a mayonese consistency which is not good for lubrication, not to mention
causes corrosion.  When the engine is run at the proper oil temps, gasoline
and water vapor have no chance to condense on cold engine parts and this
allows them to be vented out of the engine case.  In the 1962 and later VWs
they have a breather system that sucks this vapor from the engine case to the
oil bath air cleaner to be reburned in the engine.  Thusly a better running
engine, cleaner burning and better MPG.   Eric &amp; Barb
PS Only a happy warm engine will have it's rings and cylinder seated properly.
Which when this is happens the rings do thier best to seal the cylinder
cambers from the engine case.  EEE&amp;B
