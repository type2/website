Finally, the '59 15 Window rolled up last night around 9:00.  Jim Shain of
Shart Transports (the fellow Ronnie F. recommended to the list several times,
THANKS RONNIE) transported the bus for me from Hiawatha, Kansas.  This is the
bus that Erin Lassely (THANKS ERIN) posted to the list back in June.  If
anyone needs a transport company call Jim at Shart (800)556-0059.  He's a
super guy, honest and affordable.

Anyway, the bus is awesome.  Not showroom awesome, but complete and no
rust/dents awesome.  The rockers are perfect, rear corners are perfect, frame
is perfect, front nose is perfect, a few small holes in the floorpans but easy
patch stuff.  All the interior panels are there including the chrome trim,
middle seat, there, rear seat, there.  Corner glass is good, jailbars are
there, even the original blockoff plate is there.  As far as I can tell the
bus has never been hit. 

The entire inside is covered in what looks to be 4 years of dust, and given
the fact that I did my initial inspection with a penlight flashlight at 10:30
pm I'm sure some not so pretty truths will show up today when I really go over
the thing.  I did check out the exterior this morning before shoveling off to
work and was really pleased with the way things look.

The interior (dash, misc) is sealing wax red so I'm assuming the original
colors were SWR and Beige Grey.  Whether that is true or not those are the
colors that I'm going to go with whenever the day comes for paint, 2002 maybe.
It also came with a bunch of extra parts, redux boxes, 6 pop-outs with the BIG
spoon latches, 2 complete front window frames, front emblem, etc.

Not bad for $500.00.  No engine, tho.  More to follow.

Sounds like a great deal. Exactly the same conditis my 63 15 window that I
picked up a few years ago. I paid $400, but missing the middle seat. There are
still some great deals out there, we just need to keep waiting.
Good luck with your 15 window.
