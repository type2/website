&lt;&lt; Thanks for the help!  I am running the stock exhaust, putting the &quot;dizzy&quot; 
on.  Reading the article regarding jetting by Bob Donald he states that I 
should go from a 127 to a 135 main jet (roughly).&gt;&gt;

Hi Andy,
You are welcome!  The year/type of air cleaner and engine compartment used 
also makes a differance in the jetting of carb especially in pre-1968 VWs.

&lt;&lt; I have a new 34PICT3 carb on the dbl now, it runs great through the gears 
except for the lag in 1st.  Idles great.  I actually have two of the 34's.  I 
guess I should tear one down, rejet, put in rivet, set timing and see what it 
gives me with the 009.  Then put on the dizzy, reset timing and try that?&gt;&gt;

That might work!  With carbs the best thing to do is try it in steps and 
remember that the pilot jet and air correction screw are controling the idle. 
 While the main jet begins working just above idle right after the 
accelerator pump gets it started moving up in RPMs.  Then the air correction 
jet should lean out the mixture by allowing bubbles of air to be sucked into 
the fuel going to the main jet in the higher RPMs to prevent the main jet 
from over enriching the air/fuel mixture.

&lt;&lt; Will I be tar and feathered if I show up at the red barn with a 67' dbl 
cab? &gt;&gt;

Doubt it!  Best to talk to those who have and are going there though.  We can 
not make it this year.
