&gt;&gt; I noticed that the fuel filter between the fuel pump and the carb was not 
really full of gas, and the longer it idled the lower the volume of gas in the 
filter got, until there was barely any in there. How much fuel should be in 
there while the bus is idling? &lt;&lt;

Hi Kevin,
We seen all sorts of fuel amounts in those plastic fuel filters on perfectly 
running engines.  As long as there is some fuel flow through them it seems 
fine.
