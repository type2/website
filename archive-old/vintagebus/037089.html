&lt;&lt;  My '61 westy has a starting problem.  When it is hot or even warm, it

engine turns over with out a problem and when running, it runs great.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
We had the same problem with our 1963 SC a year or two ago.  Turned out to be 
the original ignition switch was dieing and this resulted in too little 
voltage to the solinoid.  This in turn resulted in the solinoid not firmly 
switching on the starter motor so the stater motor itself also would not get 
enough voltage.  So the truck would start like a champ when cold, but barely 
or not quite make it when warm!  The ony way we figured this out was to go 
through the wiring with a ohm/voltage multimeter checking the voltage at each 
connection.   Eric&amp;Barb
