Subject: Milwaukee vicinity folks

Anyone near Milwaukee know where I could go to spray my bus.  I'm
desperate!  U-Spray doesn't rent out spray booths anymore.  I've go my
own HVLP and some good paint, but my garage is way too tight to do the
topcoat.  Need to make it one color before I move in a couple weeks.
Help!

Thanks in advance,

Chris
