Sounds about right.  Make sure you have all the parts.

For a Non walk through:

Rear facing seat, icebox (with the correct pump for your year), side cabinet, big table (with prop and floor attachment ring), small folding table that mounts to icebox, small table that mounts to forward cargo door, spice rack and bracket that it hangs on, z-bed with all hinges (usually broken), rear cushion, (non walkthrough) rear side cabinet (drivers side), upper roof cabinet.  In addition, try and get the smaller stuff.  This would include front curtains, side and rear curtains and rods (6 short and 2 long)and both side lights (either clam shell or rectangle with the mounting brackets and switches).  Also make sure the tray and rack as well as the brass drain on the icebox is there.  These are a bit hard to find. 

Make sure the kit is for a split.  The cabinet handles are squared off with the exception of the late 67 kits which had the same ones as the later bay ones.  Make sure the brass tag with the year of manufacture is on the base of the Z-bed.


If you get all this stuff, $400 sounds about right.  For example, I seen just the spice rack selling for 250.  Of course the seller was totally out of his mind. I ended up paying a little more for a rusty Westy that had all the parts.  It sucks trying to find all the little things...make sure it is complete.
