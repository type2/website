&gt;Do yourself a big favor and get the solid steel insert and tools for this
job
&gt;&gt;from Time-sert.

This is great to know!  I'll scan the net and try to locate them.

&gt;Ther round top is what you need.  Eric&amp;Barb

Just like the bug then right?  I've got tons of those tins laying around -
that shouldn't be a problem.

Thanks Eric&amp;Barb!
