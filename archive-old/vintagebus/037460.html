Hi Volks,

pleased to read about another commercial bus on the road!

&gt; Here is something I've noticed about the cab divider. When driving at
&gt; night the cab divider reflects the oncoming traffic's headlights in
&gt; the rear view mirror, making it look like you have cars behind you. It
&gt; was a little distracting at first but I've gotten used to it.

It is a little irritating at first, I agree.  Also when reversing at 
night, you tend to see a reflection of what your headlights are 
illuminating in the interior rearview mirror, rather than what's 
behind your bus.  Reversing with parking lights only on is the 
logical solution.

           I noticed this same thing when I got my 59 single cab.  After a few
days I got used to it.
 .. . . . . .  
&gt; I'm getting gas at the ol' petrol station and see the
&gt; air/water thingy is actually working, and it's free.

!! You mean there are places in the US that *charge* for use of the 
air thingy??!  Gosh.  :-(

              yup- most places   
  ..  .. . . . 

BTW: I just sold a perfectly good Golf to raise funds for buying either 
a '68 post highroof or a '71 single cab, either of which would be my 
fourth bus, and no passenger or camper version among them.  Am I nuts 
or what?  :-)  Some started to call me the &quot;Panel Van Nazi&quot; here 
lately ('62, '71, '72 so far), seems I oughta go for the SC... to 
prove them wrong, you know?  Or mebbe both... we'll see. ;-)))
