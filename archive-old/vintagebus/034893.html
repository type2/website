&lt;&lt; I've seen this discussion go round before. Has anyone gotten their local 
machinist / pal to make sleeves for the mounting studs? I can't imagine why 
this would not work.

The 64 to 67 tranny mount is a simple bolt in in place of the mid59-63 when 
using the big nut, I was just wondering if the 59-63 mount could be used 
because Clara didn't mention it and  usually seems quite detailed in her 
descriptions. I like to replace mine (of unknown age/mileage) when I have to 
pull the tranny anyway.
