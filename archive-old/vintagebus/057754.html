Subject: RE: [VB] eBarndoor goldmine

&gt;any bets on what the eBarndoor carcass price is going to end up at?  I'm=

guessing  $3,143.55 
&gt;
I can't believe someone bid more than $25.

I'm betting whatever it ends up at, the person will flake out and it will=

end up on eBay again.

They seem to have done a decent job replacing the front clip and dashboar=
d
with a later model setup.
