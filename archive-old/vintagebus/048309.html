Subject: Rear bumpers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My '58 came with a rear bumper, and without looking at it, I just bought a 
bunch of the hardware that the front bumper used, but I have no idea how the 
rear bumper goes on. Are there supposed to be brackets for them? My guess is 
that there had to have been, are they hard to find? Also, what did they have 
on them. Both bumpers are white, but have holes and markings that had to have 
been for overriders or rubber trim. Can anyone fill me in with this info? 
Thanks   :-)
