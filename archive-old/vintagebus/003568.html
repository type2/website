Hi,

I learned to drive in my bus. It's a hand me down from my Dad. As soon
as Dad saw that I knew the difference between the gas pedal and the
brake in an automatic, he took me into San Francisco for some
&quot;training&quot;. I learned real quick that if there was a red light at the
top of the hill, you wanted to be at the front so you could hook your
front wheels over the top onto the level pavement. This prevented you
from rolling back down the hill while waiting for the light to change.

Chris

Scott, don't let your son burn up the clutch.
