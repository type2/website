 :  &gt; I need some help, I am going to paint my 76 westphalia. It's that school
 :  bus yellow color. But my local paint store needs the paint number. Can
 :  anyone help. Thank's a lot.
  &gt;&gt;


I think that colour is called Sierra.  Does anyone have a bay window parts 
list?-- it should list the L code that the paint supplier can use hopefully 
to mix that colour.

I know this is the split list, but I don't think he was asking where to find 
a yellow, but how to find that *particular* yellow.   er- sort of a 
restoration question...  funny about that- even the late bays are getting old 
now.


on the later splits there is a sticker behind the passenger seat that says 
the colour (in German) and has the L code on it-  I dunno if they put them in 
the bays or if yours is still there, but it is worth checking out.  

Actually,if anyone has that handdbok they send you when you send your 10DM to 
the automuseum stiftling for your bus data, it does have the info on bays, 
and should have the colour codes for them.  Mine is unfortunately 
inconviently locaed right now.
