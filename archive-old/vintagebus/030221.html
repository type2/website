Subject: Under bed spare tire &quot;hanger&quot;, etc....

I just got back from picking up my &quot;new&quot; Euro Single Cab. Aside from
alot of surface rust this thing is nice and solid. When sitting in the
drivers seat it looks a feels like a new Bus. Everything is very
original (with documentation) and very tight. It made the 6+ hour drive
home with no problem following the '66 ex-camper Kombi (soon to be for
sale) on the tow behind the GMC

Anyway on to my question(s)....

Did Euro Trucks have black or white interior pieces? (Knobs, handles,
steering wheel, etc.) The paint is  white, but it has a black wheel,
black t/s switch, white column, black steering lock / ign., white knobs
and white inside door handles handles.

The truck has the original Euro bumpers, steering lock, and Euro
headlight lenses, but no sign of Euro tail lights or the t/s switch to
go with them. Any ideas??

The truck also has the spare tie mounted in a cradle under the bed
(pictures tomorrow) I've seen this twice before. Once in either Thom or
Everett's galleries and in the latest issue of Hot VW's. Is this a VW
option, and if so what is the m-code? I have must of them sorted out,
but I don't see this one.....
