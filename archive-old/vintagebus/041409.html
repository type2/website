Scott,
What type of hoses are these?  Are they AN-8 fittings on the ends?  If so
there should be no reason for them to leak if they are properly made.  I
think there are some hoses out there that are steel braided, but aren't
really hydraulic type fittings?  Two places for leaks are the pipe
fittings if they aren't tight enough- I just had to pull my new cooler out
Saturday because of this, or the fittings.  They shouldn't leak at the
crimps where they are swedged on unless the hoses are made wrong.  Usually
you need to be careful to use a backup wrench on the fitting the hose
connection goes onto so the filter/cooler/block etc. don't get cracked by
the pipe fitting.  
I'm assuming you have a full-flow filter system since you have external
hoses?


&gt; Should I try to get a hose or have on made and fix it or should I try the 
&gt; pump that JCW sells that has the filter right on the side? Are these any 
&gt; good? Am I better off with the hose system that puts the filter in the 
&gt; engine compartmen? I'm not asking about conviencence, which is a better 
&gt; setup.

If you already have a full-flow system there wouldn't be much sense to me
to go backwards to a filter pump, but that's just an opinion.  I'm
considering trying one of Ronnie's pumps next engine.  Full flow is lots
of money and trouble when for most uses maybe a filter pump would be good
if it really works.  If you have a new hose made, make sure what you are
getting.  Most hydraulic places can make this stuff up.  It's not cheap. I
just paid about $175 for four hoses, but hopefully I'll never need new
ones.  I use the Teflon lined SS hoses with AN fittings, and once I get
them in and going they go a good long time.  I've been running them in my
bug for 10 years with no problems.
