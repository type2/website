Hi Volks,
In the military walnut shells are often fed into running turbine engines of 
helicopters to polish and clean out the carbon in there.  More than once some 
newbie on the flight line has jumped the personal tossing the shells into the 
engine, thinking sabotage by FOD was going on.

&lt;&lt;The only problem I had was the media size wasn't very regular, meaning I 
kept having big chunks of oversized media clogging my nozzle.  &gt;&gt;
Wonder if running it through a screen first would help that problem out.
