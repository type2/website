What I observed was with the engine off and manually operating the
throttle from the engine compartment enough to cause the acceleration
pump to trigger, a drop of gasoline would form on the right side of
the carb off of the end of the shaft housing.  The left housing got
wet, but not to the point of developing a visible drop.  None of
things connected to the accelerator pump had any gasoline on them, so
I'm pretty sure that it is not leaking.

This doesn't really have any of the signs of being float valve or
over-pressure related.
