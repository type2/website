Thanks to all for the encouragement. I forgot to say that my '64 has a
'67 tranny and a 1600dp. When I drove her home from OKC, where I bought
her, which is about a 4 hour drive, I did 70-75 the whole way without a
problem. This was in the summer and then she didn't have an engine lid.
(now she does though.) So now if I can convince the wife I can sell the
Volvo, and get another VW!!!!! Thanks again.
