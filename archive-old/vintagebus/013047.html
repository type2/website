&gt; You mention buying wire at the store.  You aren't going
to do the whole harness in red wire like the PO of every
bus I have ever bought, are you?
&gt;
I am now!!!  Either that or I use solid core wire like the
OO and wire up a big Frankenstein throw switch for the
headlights.

Where did you find striped wire like the original?
