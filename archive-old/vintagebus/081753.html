Subject: Re: [VB] Shift tube dust boots &amp; shift coupler

&gt;&gt;  Due to a space issue I'm concerned about the rear boot interfering with 
the  movement of the shift coupler and shift tube and therefore proper shifting 
of  the
transaxle.&lt;&lt;
Hi Mike,
In our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion we had no problem  there.

&gt;&gt;  Also does it matter which end of the shift coupler fits on the shift  
tube? Flat side forward?&lt;&lt;
We do not think that matters.

&gt;&gt;   Last thing is, I forgot to mark the spring plate  and RGB with a chisel 
before removal but I could see the outline of the RGB on  the spring plate and 
marked it with paint. Without the mark is there going to  be a major problem 
when aligning everything?   &lt;&lt;


We have never marked ours because the RGB mounting holes are very  tight.
