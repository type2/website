My Sundial windows were, while all together, junk. They are of such flimsy
comstruction that re-assembly was nearly impossible. Also, some of the tiny
sliders that go on a track were either badly damaged or missing entirely. I
would think those little dudes would be nearly impossible to replace. Maybe
not.

I ended up taking most of the assembly off and making the frame and glass
into pop-out windows with pop-out locks from the back windows of old
beetles. I will have to come up with a design for the screens, but it seems
to work very well.

Before I decided on how to do the project I bought 3 Sundial window
assemblies at a swap meet, so they can be found, but the condition varied
wildly.

Good Luck.

&gt; The '64 Sundial I recently purchased had the awning windows ripped out and
&gt; replaced w/ Plexiglas.  Only one of the original windows remains.  The
&gt; original frames to the windows are still in place, but I think I'll need
to
&gt; replace the entire unit.  I'm on the hunt for at least 4 of these.
Anybody
&gt; have some laying around they would like to part with?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
