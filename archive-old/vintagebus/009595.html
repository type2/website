Spaced off the new bushing carrier from the floor just a little last night
and reverse is fine now.  The new gate is very different feeling.  The
shifter only goes about half as far towards the passenger as it used to.  I
noticed that the newer style gate was narrower.  Shifting is quiet.  The
transmission noise is a little bit less too.  Antiseized the new coupling
and screws.  Now all I have to do is remember to saftey wire it during
lunch.
Don't worry Clara,  I'm saving those old parts.:)

John
