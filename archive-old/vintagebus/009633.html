-:Since painting my bus, I still have the window frames out for the driver and
:passenger doors. Without the windows , it sure looks nice, but not too
:weatherproof!
:
:Has anyone left their windows out and re-done the trim? Or even better, has
:anyone done something custom like my &quot;Thing&quot;, so that you can just plug in
:some windows when you need them!
:

I had a friend who took his windows off every spring and left them off 'til late fall. It was really nice having all that ventilation and being able to hang out the windows and socialize. It should be possible to make some Lexan or Plexi-glas side curtains that could be easily installed and removed.
