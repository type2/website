Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 23 window Bus owner finally  ?'s about how to go
  about  this

Dude, you are a HUGE dude, dude.

That pic of you standing in front of the bus, you're
like, a head taller than it?!!

I'm 6'2&quot; and I think my bus is still taler than me.

I suggest you just get a bat and punch upward through
some of that cab roof rust and make yourself a
driver's hatch. 

Good luck. It's the ones like you who are true
visionaries. Actually not even close to some of the
worst busses I've seen brought back to wood-inducing
quality.

formerly black deluxew trim, too. It's a long road
back, but take it one meter at a time, bro)
