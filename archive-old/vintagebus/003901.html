Subject: gaskets for the rdx box?
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2000 20:10:26 -0800

Hi folks,

Just stopped by the FLAPS (a week ago I didn't even know what that meant,
now it seems a part of my regular vocabulary) and picked up some of that so
called &quot;aircraft&quot; sealant for my rdx box to spring plate leak (as per
discussion last week). I'm planning on getting at it tomorrow. In the aisle,
right next to the sealants, was a variety of gasket materials - sheets and
rolls of gasket stuff of all different thicknesses, etc. I'm wondering -
should I get some and cut it to fit between the rdx box and spring plate?
Would it help any or would it make things worse? This is just a fixer to
keep the fluid in the tranny to give it a little longer life (it's been
without fluid - at least without the fluid that leaked from the reduction
boxes - for a couple of years, and still works fine, but I know eventually
I'll have to go for a new one).

Would putting a gasket in there help? Or should I just clean the surfaces
and use the sealant? How about sealant and gasket?

Thanks, I'm going for it without the gaskets tomorrow morning...unless I
hear any support for gasket material.

BTW - for you San Diego folk, while I was at the store, I saw a flier for
the swap meet at Qualcom this Sunday. Anyone ever been to one? What's the VW
content like? Is it worth the drive down there, or will it just be a bunch
of old Chevy stuff?
