If your accelerator cable tube is coming through the fan housing it sound like
you are missing a spring and a clip(not sure what the clip is called. 

My set up has the tube running through the fan shrouding, with an odd angled
end on it to keep it from going all the way through(towards the front).

The accelrator cable passes through this.

I put a spring over the accelerator cable. Then another tube of some sort, now
my accelrator cable has a bulge in it at this point. A clip goes over the
accelrator cable, keepint the second tube spring loaded against the first
tube, thereby keeping the tubue in the fan shroud in place. 

that probably sounds pretty confusing, maybe someone has a pic. or you could
try to look inside another vw.

oh yeah---as for the spring not being stong enough, ihad a similar situation
this summer, i kep shortening the spring, to no avail, then i checked the
cable again, and sure enough it was catching on something. After i freed it-no
problems.
