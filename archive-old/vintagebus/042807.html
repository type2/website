Hi all,

I owned this one once upon a time. It was advertised in SOTO back in the
late 1980's.  Please reply to ThatVWGuy_at_aol_dot_com

For Sale: 1960 Crew Cab - was stored for several years then restoration was
started...then the PO passed away. I bought it for the engine and want to sell
the rest. I drove it home (needs brake work) and pulled the engine. The rest
is as I found it. Complete with all gates and the back seat. This is not a
pristine bus, but is still worthy of attention and needs a good home.

Has typical rust in rockers, passenger side of the front floor, and rear of
front wheel wells. Previously had Corvair engine installed so you will need to
remove some extra wires. - had a VW engine installed when I bought it so no
problems making it run.  

Does have a newer &quot;freeway flier&quot; Transaxle with _at_12K miles, the rear seat and
support, and three good bed gates!

Will part out if no serious buyers surface within a month or so. Truck is
located just outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Asking $1400 obo as she sits or
$1000 obo without Transaxle.  Open to cash + trade.  Email pictures available.
