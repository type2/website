Hi Ronnie,
Yup, they sure are!  Also the phenolic friction washers used there are the 
same ones used in safaris for the sliders.  We just found out that 1968-71 
buses use the same retaining springs in the fresh air intake linkage under 
the center of the dash board as used on the thermostatic flaps system linkage 
in front of the fan shroud for the upright predoghouse engines.  Eric&amp;Barb
