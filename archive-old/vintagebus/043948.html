Kinda fun verifying info on our cars/busses.  I've been using facts
gleaned from this list in pulling the numbers and correlating them to
known records.  I have been able to match up some of them, but not all.
Hopefully someone can assist.
I.D. behind the seat:
03    radio?       6   ??????

430  ????   B42 Std Westy w/roof rack, pop top and tent   J98 ????

080 Walk thru Kombi, LHD only      108 ?????  UT  USA destined- port
                                                      of entry????

then for the last #s2312 523907 6163674

I'm pretty sure the 1500 sngl port is a Bus motor H5 374 524
One thing that I can't figure tho, the carb.  It has a tag riveted to the
top of the float bowl and the only other identifying marks are a &quot;W&quot; in a
couple of areas.  Brazillian?  It's a carb I've never seen before.

Thanks to those that can offer info.
later
