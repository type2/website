Hi John,
Did you wire the coil backward?  This would cause a weak spark to be easily 
flooded which is partly what happens when spark plugs are soaked with fuel so 
badly they do not spark in the electrode gaps. 
  Unscrew your spark plug ends off thier wires and cut off about 1/4&quot; of 
insulation from each wire.  Then bend the wire strands outward and rescrew 
back on the plug wire ends.  Doing this insures that the wire strands are in 
contact with the spark plug wire ends and not pulled up into the insulation.  
While you have one of the spark plug end off it would not be a bad time to 
test for spark and spark color!   Eric&amp;Barb
