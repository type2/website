Stephen,

First, my post was not a flame directed at anyone.

Secondly, yeah, just VENTING.  Just like you were with you're dealings
with the
'63.

The point of the message was not to complain about loosing a stupid
vehicle.
The point was to show  the ETHICAL concerns that this particular
situation
brings to light.  I was not complaining about competition.  I was
pointing out
the LACK of ethical business dealings we see all the time in our VW
world and
world in general.  I'm sure you understand the difference.

Ethics are an unwritten set of &quot;rules&quot;, if you will, that a society
abides by.
Of course different societies have different ethical standards.   We as
people
living within this society should act in accordance of those established
mores.

You stated &quot;Highest bidder may not seem fair to all, but isn't it really
the
seller who
decides?&quot;  To clarify the situation, both bidders were stalled at
$3,000,
neither one would go any higher.  You are correct in stating that the
decision
at that point was in the sellers hands, but  he would not make a
decision and
forced us into the number game.  This is the point at which I felt he
failed in
dealing ethically .  The correct thing to have done would  have been to
award
the sale to the bidder who had committed to wanting the vehicle first.
I, as
an ethical buyer, would have seen this as the &quot;right&quot; thing to do even
if I
were not the person who made the offer first.  It is just the right
thing to
do.

Have you ever purchased a home?  I have, as I'm sure many others on the
list
have done.  You're dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars when
you make
an offer on a house, not just a few.  Would you accept business dealings
on par
with what I described?  I'm sure not many people would.  In fact, no
State in
the Union would and there are laws to make sure that the society's
ethical
standards are upheld.

Lets face it, we all know what is right and what is wrong, even though
it might
be tough to define.  You felt you had been wronged by Issaiah.  How so?
He was
closer, right?  He got to it first.  He really wanted it.  Doesn't that
make
him right?  Probably not.  But why??  Because, you had dealt with the
seller
FIRST, and had committed to buying the bus.  Right?

The point to the post was only to show how our society's morals and
ethical
standards are changing (not for the better in my opinion), and how
people
should understand this is not still the world where a man's word or hand
shake
is &quot;as good as gold&quot; .

Please p-mail me if you'd like to continue the discussion, as I'm sure
any
further public banter is not very interesting to any one else on the
list.

Steve
