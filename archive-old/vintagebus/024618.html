Did you use a sending unit from a 67 beetle too?   Or did you use a bus
sending unit.  Fuel gauges are basically voltmeters.  The sending unit
in the tank is a rheostat (variable resistor).  As the fuel gets used,
the float drops, and the resistance increases.  as the resistance
increases, the voltage drops, with corresponding change in needle
position.  

That being said, is your bus 12 volts?  Did you make sure the sending
unit was securely grounded to the body?  Is the gauge grounded?

 a beetle speedo (i used a '67) with a gauge built in and put in a new

 with a sender. i can't really fit that gauge into my '60 ...
 i'm wondering if this is due to resistance?  i was hoping
 for an easier solution :-)'
