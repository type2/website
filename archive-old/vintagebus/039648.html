Hey all,

I've been trying to do Eric&amp;Barb's double circuit master cylinder conversion 
with much difficulty!  I filed the pushrod and put in a wood (will upgrade 
once system works) spacer.  It is hard to adjust even with the spacer.  I 
have 1mm of play but the pushrod bolt is very close to the end of the MC 
cylinder tube.  My bus has one new metal line, all new flex lines and shoes, 
and one new wheel cylinder in back and one up front(the rest of cylinders 
have been cleaned and sanded out with 400 grit).  I've notice a drop of 
brake fluid accumilating on the under side of the MC casting by the mounting 
boltes and one drop under the looped short metal line to bridge the front 
circuit.  When I bleed the brakes only the rear drivers side squirts with 
good pressure.  The other three wheels have a spurt of spray and then spit a 
little and stop.  the pedal doesn't drop more to let all air it just stops.  
When I drive the bus the brakes suck!  And I have to pump at least 3 times 
on the pedal to stop,sometimes with emergency brake service necessary.  If 
I'm on a hill and it's pumped up after a few seconds i loose pressure and 
start to roll!  I noticed some more fluid (could be left from messy bleeding 
but doubt it) around the backing plate of a front wheel.  It seems like more 
air is getting into the system.  I don't notice a drop in brake fluid in the 
reservoir.  I don't feel like I can even bleed them properly.  I'm about to 
check the brake line inside the front wheel between the 2 wheel cylinders.  
Any advice on a plan of attack to sovle this nightmare.  I don't have any 
cash to get new cylinders and really want to get this bus to stop to make it 
to high country next weekend!  Thanks in advance for any help!  Sorry I 
rambled so long just wanted to fully illustrate this problem.

Thanks,

Eric
