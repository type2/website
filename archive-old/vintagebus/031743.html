   Just got a phone call from fellow list member Liam from Alaska, he was in
Palm Springs, Cali.on his way to Havasu. Then from here he's going to
busavan to Prescott with us. He wanted to know if anybody saw him driving
down from Alaska, he's in a yellow, red, black and white Sundial Camper.

ps: If anybody coming to Presscott has a LARGE Sundial crank out window, he
needs one. His blew out in San Fransisco.
