Subject: More work on the 67 Deluxe...
Date: Tue, 14 Mar 2000 07:48:35 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was out until about quarter after 10 last night working on the bus.  I'm
having to redo a lot of things that I had already done on the 66 which kind
of sucks but I keep thinking about how much better shape the body is and
that keeps me going.  I'm really kind of torn between parting the 66 out and
hanging on to it because I put so much work into it despite the body being
bad.  Too, the fact that it belonged to a family friend doesn't help anyway
and beings I'm a really sentimental type of person, well...it's hard.  For
now, I'm telling myself that I can get the 66 running someday but I don't
know if that's really true or not.  Granted, I do have enough parts right
now to make both buses runners - maybe someday in the future. Anyway, on
with the update...

I pulled the parcel trey down in the 67 (I left it in there because I didn't
feel like pulling the speedo cable) and started tracking down the wiring.
So far, it isn't too spaghetti'd.  The oil temp guage that someone added in
the dash next to the fuel guage by cutting a hole is nothing spectactular
but I did remove it.  I tracked the wiring for it and it runs down in behind
the kick panel (which I have yet to remove) and for the back lighting,
someone pulled off the left bulb wire in the speedo cluster and stuck it on
the guage.  Well that makes a lot of sense - rob your lighting for the
speedo in favour of the oil temp guage?!?!  I removed the radio (which
hasn't worked yet) and the JVC speaker that someone hacked in and pulled the
clock out of the dash.  The clock has a couple of date stamps on it - one
being 3/67 and 5/67 so this is a bus that was made fairly close to the last
of the run.  I haven't yet written down the VIN number but I'll get it
posted to the list eventually and we can see how close to the end it was.

I've also found signs that this bus was a previous restoration as evidenced
by the random welding marks inside the doors and recovered door panels and
seats.  That is probably as old as it is, it's still in remarkable shape.  I
still can't get over the fact that front floor has NO rust thru whatsoever.
The worst part of the rust is just behind the driver's and passenger's
seats - it's a strip all the way across that gets really nastly by the
jacking points.  Still, compare this to my 66 which has NO jacking points
left - the rust is that bad.

Anyway, I traced a few wires and labeled them.  Tonight (weather
permitting), I'm gonna wash the dash down really well and put in the speedo
from the 66 that I reconditioned.  I'm also going to rob the turn signal
switch from the 66 as well as the 12v wiper motor that I refurbished.
Sounds like the 66 is more a parts bus by the minute doesn't it. :-(

One last item I moved over was the jailbars.  Despite the rust on the 66, it
was a very complete bus - all the little details were there.  Question:  I
think I have a flaky hazard switch in the 67 - will the switches from my 66
(Despite the difference in the color and shape of the knobs) move over and
work?

All fer now...
