&gt; Seems that they have become very popular and more upstyle in an effort, I

&gt; Give it a shot....those kinds of measuring tools are usually in stock.


Be sure to do your homework first!  Get a catalog from Enco
(www_dot_use-enco_dot_com 1800-use-enco), or some place, so you have an idea of
what these things are worth new.  I've seen some mid-quality measuring
tools sell for 2-3 times what they could be gotten new, and abused high
quality tools for the same ore more then new!!  (and some of that was
AFTER i tried to talk him down...various pawn shops too.)

OTOH, there are sometimes good deals.  Just be sure you know what you are
buying and what it is really worth.


&gt; have the facilities to calibrate, and at the $58 to $70 an hour fees for
&gt; calibrating...makes a good deal on a micrometer go to hell quick!

Aye!


later...david
