Subject: Bubblehead stickers needed
To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Thom Fitzpatrick was asking for a good source for VW
related stickers...

I always recommend my favorite source for VW stickers
as Rex Eastman of Merced, California. Watch for him a
darned near every Western VW show or email him
directly at &quot;Rex Eastman&quot; &lt;oldvws_at_sierratel_dot_com&gt;. Come
on and support a VW vendor who is into VW's full-time.
