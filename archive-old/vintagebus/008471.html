So I'm trying to figure out what this thing is on the bottom of my removable
seat cushion behind the drivers seat.
In the June 2001 issue of hotvws and on pages 74-75 there's a'65 non-walk
thru westy, but in the photo with the tent set up there appears to be a
walk-thru seat mounted on a stool frame. Could this be it? Next weekend
hopefully Rex will have his digital camera with him to take a pic of this
thing.
