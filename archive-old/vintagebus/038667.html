&gt; There should be a curved duct that goes through the hole in the tin and
&gt; draws air from the cylinder finning at the back of the engine.  A
&gt; paper/foil hose clamps to this and to your air cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like your duct is missing, so you'll have to scrounge one up!

I should have been more clear in my description:) The duct is present
however it is currently capped off with a hose clamp and flexible foil lid
from a can of peanuts. The issue that I am up against is the that the duct
that comes thru the hole in tin is about 2&quot; in diameter ass opposed to the
inlet on the stock 1967 oil bath air cleaner is about 5/8&quot; in diameter. I
need to find a way tho step down the hose from the large size to the
smaller. I guess duct tape would work but.........)
