&lt;snip&gt;wire up a big Frankenstein throw switch for the
headlights.

Where did you find striped wire like the original?

- Everett Barnes

I should hook one of those up on the rustybus.

I found the original striped wire in original harnesses.  What I did with the last one was take the harness I was fixing and actually clip the original wires in the middle, flip the end around so the pretty end was at the end, cut off any crusty part, add in some aftermarket wire or original wire in the middle to bring the wire back to the stock length, solder together all the pieces, put on new shrink tubing, put on factory ends or solder the ends for screw terminal, and away you go.  So far it looks like it works well.  The lights are bright, even though it is 6V.  I'll give an update once we drive the bus for a while.

Everett, let me know if you need help with the wiring.  Wiring is fun and exciting.  Heck, barndoors only have about 3 wires in them.
