Steve,

I don't wish to offend your or anyone else... but there have been no less
than three similar flame threads on the various mailing lists in last 12
hours!  One punching on a fellow Seattle listee that I have considerable
respect for...

Are you just VENTING, or actually think there is something &quot;wrong with the
system&quot;.

To me, the seller determines the sell.  Just like a restaurant can refuse
service to anyone... I mean you guys were bidding 2/3 the asking price, and
unless this DC was a complete POS, $2000 isn't 10x the value... it is within
range.  Hell, if it was _rust free and straight_ as you describe, easily
worth $4000 if sold with complete photo spread on the Internet (Likely
$5500).

Highest bidder may not seem fair to all, but isn't it really the seller who
decides?  I don't see anything wrong with the system here... sure, I would
vent too if I lost a bus that I wanted (and I have in the past)... but your
message seems to be implying that there is something wrong with competition
:)  I can somewhat understand that until one of you offered what the guy was
asking (or what it is worth) it seems fair to have you compete.  If you had
offered the asking price up front and he sold it to someone else at same or
lower, then sure... more to complain about.

I don't know, seem spretty clear when you have multiple offers UNDER asking
that it isn't a sold bus...

Wow, how appropriate to my day!  I had something similar happen just today.
Although not exactly the same, it does show how unethical many people are in
our society today.  My story revolves around a very straight and rust free
DC
that was at Pomona yesterday.  I was dealing with the person who brought the
truck to the swap, but was not the owner, and was not prepared to give a
definitive yes or no response to a legitimate cash offer (first red flag!).
I
looked at the truck and made an offer and emphatically stated I did want the
truck.  I went on my way expecting a phone call from the real owner.

There was another bidder unbeknownst to me yesterday.  The blasted owner
strung both of us along making each other bid higher.  Ebay's got nothing on
this guy!  The whole mess culminated in a f'ing 3 way conference call
between
the other bidder, the owner and myself.  I couldn't even believe it was
happening!  The owner was trying to have to two of us bid each other as high
as he could.  His original price was 3K.  I originally offered the proxy
(the
duffus &quot;selling&quot; the truck at Pomona) 2K with the condition that I WANTED
the
truck wanted to deal with the owner who had the final say so who wasn't
there.  After many calls I finally got the proxy on the phone and he told me
someone offered $2300.  &quot;OK&quot;, I said &quot;I'll match that&quot;.  This went on back
and
forth till this afternoon when the 3 way call happened.

The end result is that the other bidder and myself stalled at 3K (the
original
asking price) and no
more.  I felt that since I was the first to see the truck and make a
legitimate offer that all things being equal as far as price goes, the
person
who saw it first and made the first bid should get it.  What do you think??

The final result was that we actually picked a # between 1 and 50...I picked
badly (crap).  Oh well.  In retrospect, I should have gone higher.  But at
that point, I felt like a puppet and was sick of being manipulated.  Like
they
say, there's always another car...I hope.

This is just a small example of people not doing what is &quot;right&quot; and of the
lack of ethics in our society.  Believe me its not just in buying VWs.  If I
were the &quot;other&quot; bidder, I would have conceded that the person who saw the
bus
or part for that matter deserves the first right of refusal.

Steve
