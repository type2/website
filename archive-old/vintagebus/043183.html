Chris,

There are two ways the cable could go in - If the heater knob is centered
in the bus, then the bend point of the cable is approximately in half.

If the knob is under the driver seat, then it is about 1 to 1.5 inches
biased to that side.

In both cases, there is a loop of about 5/16 diameter that must be made at
the bend point to engage the pin in the heater control's sleeve.

Grease the cables well.  You may have to buy a second cable if you dont
get close the first time, but they are cheap.

Others on the list may want to add or correct this stuff.
