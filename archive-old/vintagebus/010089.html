Why not dump the thing back in Bus Boys' lap, get a full refund, and buy a
proper rebuilt from the &quot;other guys&quot; in Redding or wherever?

Bus Boys not only sold you a defective part, they sold you an incorrect
part.  Even if all other factors were fully acceptable, the difference in
ratio makes it the wrong unit for your vehicle.

Safety is an issue here as well.  With something so basic as the steering
wheel attachment [damaged threads and keyway] messed up, who knows what is
[or isn't!] inside the gear case?

Once again they appear to have lived down to their old, tarnished,
reputation.....

 &gt;&gt;  ...We already knew our threads were buggered, but guess what?  So was
the keyway!  So I had to clean up the keyway...

...there was a little better than 3/16&quot; of play...  That extrapolates to a
LOT at the wheel...  I wasn't able to
adjust it out without causing binding in the box.   Is this thing rebuilt,
or was it just repainted?

...A normal box has 2 1/2 turns of the wheel lock to lock;  the brazlian one
has 4 3/4!  ...Strangely,
the Bus Boys guy didn't mention this to me, although I'm sure they know.

So it looks like I'm going to KP with sloppy steering.  &lt;&lt;
