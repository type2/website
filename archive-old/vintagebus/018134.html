Subject: Clutch cable adjustment
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,

I crawled under the ol '63 today in hopes to lessen
the play in the clutch pedal.  The last time I
adjusted the cable, I had the stock two nut adjusters
on it. Now, since my tranny work was done, I have the
supposedly easier to adjust wing not adjuster. Does
anyone have some tips on how to adjust this puppy?
Mine is STUCK.  I held the cable still with some vice
grips and all, but the wing nut does not want to move
in either direction.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks!
