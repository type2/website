If any body who comes to BBB V wants to see one of these, ask me to come to
my shop. I have 2 of these built (still have a 1955 Speedster in one) but
they were built for Porsche 356, Mine are 6 sided though and do work
excellent. The biggest problem is you need space to roll them over. The
mounting points can be made adjustable to raise or lower the vehical while
working on it. The best part is they can be built for around $100 dollars in
materials.   http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/5253.jpg

All I can say is Wow!  Neat idea.  I've seen the same type of thing, but
they only tilted the bus 1/2 way.  I've never seen one built as a
complete cage.  Sort of like those medical head/neck immobilizers.

I hope he doesn't live on a hill.  Could you imagine the site of that
single cab rolling down the hill??     :-O!
