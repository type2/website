Recently, while visiting a couple of my kids in Portland, Oregon, I came
across a possible source of Type 2 parts.

The name of the place is:

            Pat's Import Auto Rd.
            34909 SE Gunderson
            Sandy, OR    (Sandy is a suburb of Portland, out toward Mt. Hood)

The only splittie he had was pretty well stripped, but he did have half a
dozen splittie front doors, and about the same number of side doors...all
remarkably un-rusty. He had a half dozen bay window vans relatively complete,
along with several beetles and Karmann Ghias.

His business card states:
            Factory Trained
            36 Years Experience
            New and Used Parts-VW Only
            Rebuilt Engines a Specialty

I guess I should include the usual disclaimer: I have no relationship,
business, personal, or otherwise, with this establishment.
