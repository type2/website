Subject: Shipping a bus

Try Dependable auto shippers.  They are on the net.  I had a bus shipped from 
california to new england.  Cost approximately $850 to $1200.  Beware however 
that alot of shippers do not drop the bus off at your door.  They usually 
have a hub where they drop off all the cars.  You can either pick it up there 
or for an additional fee they will flat bed it too you.  That will cost you.  
Dependable has several hubs on the east coast.  They were good to deal with.
