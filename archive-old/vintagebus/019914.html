Subject: Southern most listee -photo 2b posted

Recent thread on southernmost listee determined that
Alex Morris holds the title. Mr. Morris sent a photo
that I will soon be posting to Vintagebus_dot_com/gallery.
Delay in posting photo was caused by multiweek
computer reconfig. Apologies.
Hint: when loading NT4.0 cheat the FAT16 partition
down to about 1750 not 2000 max to avoid a headache!

The below message is from Alex Morris...
&lt;snip private babbling&gt; Anyways, I see that I am
listed as the southernmost member of the ABC. A claim
I believe I can hold on to with good conscious. 
And you're right, I own a 69 baywindow (Westy
weekender setup) and, drum roll please, a 67 Westy
camper, in case you forgot.
Went out to Black Island a week or so ago, on a
resupply traverse, much fun and very good to get out
of town, even if it's only 23 miles away 
(70 mile drive) and just for 3 nights. Saw arauras!
The mountain behind me
(see-http:/www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery) is Mt. Discovery.
