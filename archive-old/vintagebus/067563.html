Subject: Re: [VB] transmission problem

The release lever is replaceable.  It's a PITA, but what choice
do you have?  Call up ronnie, have him get you one out ASAP, replace
it Saturday or Sunday, and awaaaayyy you go.

&gt; After replacing the engine  in my 65 bus and it was running great to BBB and 
&gt; around town,  I heard a snap and lost all gears.  Pulled the engine again and 
&gt; the clutch release bearing LEVER is broken on one side.  Now there is nothing 
&gt; for a new release bearing to snap into....   What can I do?  Is this lever 
&gt; replaceable or am I looking at a new tranny?  I was planning on leaving for 
&gt; Mount Shasta on Wednesday but now.....
