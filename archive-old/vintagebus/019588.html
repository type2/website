Subject line says it all!  PDFs are back online.  This resulted from a combo of
the non-corrupted files from Rex Rogers and remakes of the corrupted ones (and
editing of the originals) by Matt Roberds.  The few people that have dissed me
(off list thankfully) for the choice of PNG should be happy now ;-)

The last manual I had which was a 1971-1973 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; book has been
scanned too, but it's not online yet because I'm so darn slow these days.  This
is primarily of interest only to those that run DP engines really, at least on
this list.  This was my first try at having someone else do the scanning, since
I don't have a suitable machine (ie: Windows box) for my ancient-yet-cool 
large format scanner.  Staffan Hedberg deserves the credit for this one, I 
mailed the book out to him and it was done before I knew it.

Last but...well, I guess it is least important, but I like keeping my stats :-)
Canada has been added to the int'l usage stats.  They're right behind Japan,
but the Land of the Rising Sun (and good wheel bearings ;-)) has been silent
for quite some time.

Bus content: got my parts from Ronnie today, it was all as ordered and I
_might_ take my Westy for a spin this weekend!
