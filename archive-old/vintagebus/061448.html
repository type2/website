&gt; patiently waiting for AAA to show up and haul his rattle can painted heap to
&gt; the house so he can work on fixing the latest break down in time to make it
&gt; back to school/work the following Monday AM. He will fight off the ex-wife and
&gt; estranged kids and blow off studying in order to make it in time. The guy in
&gt; the Passat and gal in the NB will have plenty of time to study and steal the
&gt; dude's potential future job.
