on further inspection...

  The battery was, of course, low.  Charged it up.    Started the bus,
generator is putting out .36 V.  Hardly sufficient, don't you think?
Feeling like an electrical idiot I did the &quot;is it the generator or the
regulator&quot; check re Muir and it indicates the generator.

this offends my sensibilities.   It worked fine before.  suddenly go bad?  I
pulled the motor out of the other bus, and put it in this one, worked fine
there. if it was the regulator it would be easy to change.  but with the
doghouse and the thermostat there it is more complicated.

Why would it do this?   Yes the brushes are good, I switched them when I had
the motor out, as the old ones were very worn.

Looking at the generator I sit on my carpeted milk crate (deluxe model) and
glare.

   It starts raining.

Move my stuff and put bus in the garage.   sit on the milk crate and glare
some more.

Pull the fan belt off and try to run the generator as a motor.   Hook the
battery charger to the D+ and ground the other side.   Generator waves to the
right, to the left, to the right, the the left, rocking back and forth in
laughter at me.

Put the charger back on the battery.

I notice a  loose white thing in the hole on top of the generator.    like a
string.   Pull at it.  smells kind burnt.  it is the insulation that was
supposed to cover a wire in there.  guess it got a hole in it, wire grounded
out.   Hm.   okay, generator bad.  Maybe I bumped something when I changed
the brushes.   Get a light and a mirror.  the wire that should have been
insulated looks a bit charred.

no bus to drive :(    guess it's time to pull the motor.    again

I don't usually feel like these old cars are POSs, but right now it's
difficult not to.
