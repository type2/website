&lt;&lt; Hey gang, simple question for a friend whose internet-challenged:  will a 
55
 deluxe sunroof clip fit a 66?   Roofs same or different? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
If you mean the non-barndoor 1955 then yes it is the same roof up to AUG1967. 
 Of course the 1966 will have to have the subfloor pans added to stiffen the 
frame and prevent warping/bending of the bus body/frame.  Eric&amp;Barb

Hey,  just a thought, but should'nt you guys be concerned with the big hatch 
/ little hatch difference?  Don't the big hatch buses have spring loaded 
things welded onto the roof corners to support the hatch?   If so,  you are 
going to have to try to put those into an early roof clip and get them square 
so the hatch closes properly and keeps rain out too.  I think it might be 
easier to try to find a 64-67 style roof clip for the swap.
