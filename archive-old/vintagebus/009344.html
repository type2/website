Vintage Motorbooks in Beaverton, OR has gobs of old VW dealer stuff.

At Puyallup last weekend they had a whole box of books and pamphlets
published by VW to train sales people in the new and changed features for
each new model year.  Lots of interesting illustrations, text, and spec
charts.

They carry lots of publications intended to be delivered with new vehicles,
including national dealer location books and warranty books.

&gt;&gt;  With each and every VW you got a dealer listing booklet!  Check your
swap meets
and literature dealers.  &lt;&lt;
