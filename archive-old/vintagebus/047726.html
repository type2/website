I'm on my second 66 and both of them have been bench seat westys. the first
one had an additional wooden shelf ledge that was convienently placed to slam
your head into if your head snapped back in collision. decided it was better
with it gone. now if I'm driving and things go terribly wrong I can still bale
over the top. Also it's good for keeping the cargo in the cargo area.
