Hi Cannon,
Well we advise against the rubberized undercoating.  It does work for a while
when applied to undercarrage of automobiles, but once rust gets any chance to
get under it the coating turns into a greenhouse for rust.  The rust makes
it's way farther and farther under the undercoating wicking water farther and
farther thru viens of rust.  Finnaly the undercaoting falls off revealing the
corrosion.  So in your case where one has installed this undercoating inside
it results in areas between the metal supports and the body sheet metal which
since VW did not dip the whole body of the bus in high zinc content primer
rusting.  This rust will make it's way under the rubberized under coating and
your protection will turn into your worst enemy.  Eric &amp; Barb
