Subject: Re: _at_WL  Re: [VB] That plastic sheath on the throttle cable,
  where does  it go?

Is it  the tube for passing through the fan housing on the  engine?


Hi,
Doubt it.  That OG tube through the shroud has always been  steel.  The only 
way to get that plastic sheath to the rear would be  to slide the sheath all 
the way to the rear of the cable, tie a knot in the  cable to keep it from 
slipping forward, and then install.  Plus we do not  think either the sheath or a 
knot would fit through the body tube!
