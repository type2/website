On a lighter note...........


Subject:  Ten Best Tools of all Time...

Forget the Snap-On Tools truck; it's never there when you need it.
Besides, there are only ten things in this world you need to fix any
car, any place, any time.

1. DUCT TAPE: Not just a tool, a veritable Swiss Army knife in
  stickum and plastic. It's safety wire, body material, radiator
  hose, upholstery, insulation, tow rope, and more in one
  easy-to-carry package. Sure, there's a prejudice surrounding duct
  tape in concourse competitions, but in the real world everything
  from LeMans - winning Porsches to Atlas rockets - uses it by the
  yard. The only thing that can get you out of more scrapes is a
  quarter and a phone booth.

2. VICE-GRIPS: Equally adept as a wrench, hammer, pliers, baling
  wire twister, breaker-off of frozen bolts, and
  wiggle-it-till-it-falls-off tool. The heavy artillery of your
  toolbox, Vice Grips are the only tool designed expressly to fix
  things screwed up beyond repair.

3. SPRAY LUBRICANTS: A considerably cheaper alternative to new
  doors, alternators, and other squeaky items. Slicker than pig
  phlegm. Repeated soakings of WD-40 will allow the main hull bolts
  of the Andrea Dora to be removed by hand. Strangely enough, an
  integral part of these sprays is the infamous little red tube
  that flies out of the nozzle if you look at it cross-eyed, one of
  the ten worst tools of all time.

4. MARGARINE TUBS WITH CLEAR LIDS: If you spend all your time under
  the hood looking for a frendle pin that caromed off the peedle
  valve when you knocked both off the air cleaner, it's because you
  eat butter. Real mechanics consume pounds of tasteless vegetable
  oil replicas, just so they can use the empty tubs for parts
  containers afterward. (Some, of course, chuck the butter-colored
  goo altogether or use it to repack wheel bearings.) Unlike air
  cleaners and radiator lips, margarine tubs aren't connected by a
  time/space wormhole to the Parallel Universe of Lost Frendle
  Pins.

5. BIG ROCK AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD: Block up a tire. Smack corroded
  battery terminals. Pound out a dent. Bop nosy know-it-all types
  on the noodle. Scientists have yet to develop a hammer that packs
  the raw banging power of granite or limestone. This is the only
  tool with which a &quot;made in India&quot; emblem is not synonymous with
  the user's maiming.

6. PLASTIC ZIP TIES: After twenty years of lashing down stray hoses
  and wired with old bread ties, some genius brought a slightly
  slicked up version to the auto parts market. Fifteen zip ties can
  transform a hulking mass of amateur-quality rewiring from a
  working model of the Brazilian rain forest into something
  remotely resembling a wiring harness. Of course, it works both
  ways. When buying used cars, subtract $100.00 for each zip tie
  under the hood.

7. RIDICULOUSLY LARGE STANDARD SCREWDRIVER WITH LIFETIME GUARANTEE:
  Let's admit it. There's nothing better for prying, chiseling,
  lifting, breaking, splitting, or mutilating than a huge
  flat-bladed screwdriver, particularly when wielded with gusto and
  a big hammer. This is also the tool of choice for oil filters so
  insanely located they can only be removed by driving a stake in
  one side and out the other. If you break the screwdriver - and
  you will, just like Dad or your shop teacher said - who cares?
  It's guaranteed.

8. BAILING WIRE: Commonly known as MG muffler brackets, bailing wire
  holds anything that's too hot for tape or ties. Like duct tape,
  it's not recommended for concourse contenders since it works so
  well you'll never replace it with the right thing again. Bailing
  wire is a sentimental favorite in some circles, particularly with
  MG, Triumph, and flathead Ford set.

9. BONKING STICK: This monstrous tuning fork with devilishly pointy
  ends is technically known as a tie-rod- end separator, but how
  often do you separate tie-ends? Once every decade, if you're
  lucky. Other than medieval combat, its real use is the all
  purpose application of undue force, not unlike that of the huge
  flat-bladed screwdriver. Nature doesn't know the bent metal panel
  or frozen exhaust pipe that can stand up to a good bonking stick.
  (Can also be used to separate tie-rod ends in a pinch, of course,
  but does a lousy job of it).

10. A QUARTER (now its $0.35) AND A PHONE BOOTH: (See #1 above.)
