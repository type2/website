OCTO was fun, 
The swap meet was VERY good.
Some of these prices were out of control though,
Nasty 1500$ westy tent, 1000$ rear bumper, DESTROYED NON USABLE bumpers _at_ 
700$. DESTROYED not usable decklid _at_ 300$.
Picked up a few cool pieces, original used abarth exhaust, 12-55 split case 
bus tranny drum to drum with confirmed 24K original miles for pennies.
Saw atleast 5 sets of barndoor bubble taillights, 5 brakelight decklids, 5 
pressed rear bumpers (not including the fiberglass ones), four middle seats 
including a short middle seat for a pressed bumper walkthrough bus, 
There was a guy from Europe with a 200$ T-can air cleaner, and piles of other 
rare goodies.
Drive home at night in pouring rain sucked.....followed the big rigs at 35 
mph.
