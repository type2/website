Hi,

Is anyone else from the list going to Volkswagens on the Green in Littleton, 
CO this weekend?  Barry Reade and I will be going up from Albuquerque 
Saturday, and if you're going to be there, look for us.  I'm in a '59 
Subhatch Westy and Barry will be in his double door combi.  Just look for a 
couple old hippie types, and stop by to say &quot;Hi&quot;.

Hope to see you there!

JP
