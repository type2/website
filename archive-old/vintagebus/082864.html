&gt;   If you decide you're going to run a lot of gauges, you might
&gt;try to get some multi-wire cable.  It's commonly sold as trailer light
&gt;cable with four 14 or 16 gauge wires; if you dig around a little you
&gt;can find cables with more wires.  With the cable, you can run the wire
&gt;for up to four gauges (excluding cylinder heat temperature) at once.

matt knows of what he speaks! with his infinite (ohms) electrical 
wisdom, i made a HUGE harness that can run 4 gauges and H4s... we got 
some overkill on our wire size - cable is like an anaconda :)  but 
the gauges work flawlessly; before, i would sometimes get electrical 
crosstalk (bad grounds, too many things on one circuit, etc) and the 
gauges would read differently than usual.  if you plan on running 
more than one instrument, i highly recommend the harness route.
