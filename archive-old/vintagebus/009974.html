Thanks to Jim and all for the kind words.  I must acknowledge that the
parafin wax trick was taught to me and others by Bill May from the vintagvw
list a few years ago.  I thought it sounded like such a bizarre approach
that it just might work.  I must admit that I've never tried it but have
heard from others that yes indeed, it works and works well.  I had it in my
.sig for a while to advertise the fact and eventually, it's been attributed
to me when all I did was merely advertise a good idea on behalf of Bill May.

I think if we all put a little mechanical tidbit or piece of advice, we
would remember it from reading it all the time.  I need to modify my .sig
with that wax trick again don't I? :-)
