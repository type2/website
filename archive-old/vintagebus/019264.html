The promotion on the 'rama doesn't seem to be anywhere near as
well-done as for the other shows; it doesn't appear on any of the
online calendars (like http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/calendar/calendar-display.cgi)
Then again, their primary audience seems to be the drag racing crowd.  I tried dracing
one time, but my high heels kept getting caught in the brake pedal, and my pantyhose
kept riding up my butt crack like you would not believe!

They need to hire Jerry Jess to do their advertising - (BTW, what's the date on
the 2012 BBB again?)
