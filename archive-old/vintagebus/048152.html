Subject: COLLISION DAMAGE REPAIR ADVICE
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

O.K.
Heres a few photos of what I need to repair.
Bumped pretty good on the headlight.
Bucket itself it shifted a bit back.
The floor is not damaged and the metal inner panel is not messed up (Id like 
to keep it that way)
Anyone have thoughts of how i should fix this!????

I have a spitznagel (nail gun) but I dont think thats strong enough to yank 
it out.
Thanks!
Greg
