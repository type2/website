&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to get my 71 registered, but they want to take my blue and
&gt; yellow plates.  I would like to keep them on the car as they look cooler
&gt; and that's what the car came with.  The problem is that with the car out
&gt; of the books the DMV says I can't keep them.  Looking through the
&gt; archives, I find that there was a bill (AB2058) which would have opened
&gt; up the ability to register a car prior to '74 with YOM plates, which
&gt; seemed to have been vetoed by the governor.  Is this true?

Yes.  Nobody can figure out why, but Davis vetoed the bill.
&gt;
  Even though
&gt; I have proof (old registration slips from the PO) can they take my
&gt; plates, or do I just need to find a different DMV person who really
&gt; wants to help me.

AFAIK, you have to put new plates on the car, but _DON'T_ give them your
old plates!  If you take the old plates in they will want to confiscate
them (that's what the regs tell them to do), but if you don't have them
with you (you lost them, right?) they will just give you the new plates.
Then, after YOM plates are OK'd by the next bill, you will be able to
switch back.
