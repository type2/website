Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

on the pre 66 system, there is a Big Red Light (BRL) on the dash near the 
speedo, which flashes.  The knob itself is red bakelite or plastic and does 
not flash.  It has an innie, like the other dash knobs. The switch is held in 
with a screw from underneath

The 66  switch is held in my an escutchon that screws in from the hole the 
knob goes onto. You use a wierd tool that is like a screwdriver with a gap in 
the middle and the slightly tapered at the outside.  using a screwdriver 
nagers up the escutchon.  The knob is translucent red plastic, and has an 
outie.  The whole switch lights up when the flashers flash.  The face  
unscrews so you can change the bulb

the 67 switch is held on the same way as the 66.  (fwiw the 68 and later 
escutchons use a different size of the same type of tool)  The knob is shaped 
of black rubber like the other 67 knobs - which are not shaped like the 66&amp; 
earlier knobs.  The face is a red plastic circle that unscrews so you can 
change the bulb.when the light flashes only the face lights up.

hadn't paid attention to whether 66 &amp; 67 switches were the same/different, 
but I know you can use a 67 knob on a 66  

if your light doesn't flash maybe see if the light bulb burned out.

 So does a 66 switch look like a 67 one, ie the knob flashes?  If not how do
 you know that the lights are flashing?
