Subject: RE: [VB] Rear Bumper Splash Guards

If you really sweet talk them maybe. They say they are sold out. Vintage
Parts also had some forever and he finally sold them out also. It's funny
how people can sit on stuff for years without an inquiry then everyone who's
got them sells out at the same time. But heck, who would pay 45 dollars each
for N O S ones?
