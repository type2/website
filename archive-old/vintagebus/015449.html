What year is this persons bus?  I might have missed
that.

Anyway my point is...if this is a 36 or 40 hp stale
air motor the copper 'shims' are actually gaskets that
keep exahust gases from sneaking in to your stale air
heating system...ya know good ole' CO2....ahhhh I feel
nice an sleepy when my heat is on...good and warm and
realll tired ahhhh...night night! :-)

Make sure you use them if you have a stale air and
plan to use your heat...if do not just ignore me.

&gt; &gt; I'm still wondering about those shims that were in
&gt; the old heads.  (circular,
&gt; &gt; metal, gasket-type things)  I didn't use any when
&gt; I put it back together.  I
&gt; &gt; don't really see why I would need to, but...  
&gt; Could that be part of the problem??
&gt; 
&gt; Not likely. They were probably there as a half-assed
&gt; way of lowering the
&gt; compression ratio.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Also, am I supposed to put sealant between the
&gt; cylinders and heads as well??
&gt; 
&gt; No. Definately not.
