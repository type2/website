Subject: Tire Report:  Yoko 370's

When I bought the 82 westy I junked the passenger tires that were on it and
bought Yokohama 370 M&amp;S (LT195/75 R14 load range D). After 26 K miles I have
had the first failure. The right rear has a tread separation (felt like a
out of balance tire at ~60) and also a warn nail on the other side. The rest
of the tires are Ok but showing wear, I expect another 10 K max before
replacement. The local dealer has ordered a replacement tire under warrantee
(don't know my cost yet) so I will have 2 new tires (spare was new) on the
rear.

Pressure has been kept at 50r/42f, tires balanced when bought, never
rotated.
