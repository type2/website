Can any of you identification Guru's help me out there?
I recently purchased what I beleive is a 1967 bus.
The chassis No is 237084098 which does not seem to be in any of the lists
I've been able to find.Has just one set of popouts at the rear,and no rear
seating.
I live in Australia ,perhaps different numbers for export?
The engine which I am sure is out a bug (1600cc?) has another number that
doesn't seem to correspond with anything .It is  AR087443............

Hope someone can help

Cheers

Phil
