Ok. I topped off my brake fluid reservoir the other day, by the way I have a

67 with a single circuit, not sure what kind. I have no pressure now and a

pile of brake fluid on the ground. So, apparently I have a leak. Question

is, is it easier to rebuild this one, which is probably a junk no name

brand..or just buy one of the single circuit ones from an earlier bus? I

have no money to go the dual circuit route, and was told earlier on the list

that a single circuit is the way to go. Any suggestions on where to order? I

have ordered from Wolfsburg West and BFY in the past, no problems, but I

have only ordered exterior parts. Thanks for any help.

if you have the  single circuit master cylinder, yours is the same as a post
BD 55 through early 67- available for circa $30 (I have heard a tad less even)
for a brazilaian Varga one.   Probably  in stock at you local VW FLAPS.   (You
can put that one on a barndoor too, actually, if you can't find a decent
barndoor one.  Been there, done that, feels better with the correct one
though)   I wouldn't bother to rebuild it, if it's bad.   

Are you sure the fluid if not from spilling when filling, and the lack of
pressure not from air in the lines?
