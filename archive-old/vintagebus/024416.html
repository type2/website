Subject: accelerator cable question

Cable tube question actually.

The cable on my bus runs through a solid tube until shortly before the
end.  At the end of the tube is
a couple feet of hose that is secured to the metal tube on one end and
not secured at the other end
(which is shortly before the metal tube which goes through the fan
shroud).

Is this the normal arrangement?  Seems a bit odd to have the one end
floating around like that.

Thanks for any info,
...Markus (and Tardis)
