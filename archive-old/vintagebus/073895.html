&gt; I was thumbing through the WCM catalog and saw a church key holder.  Pretty
&gt; &gt;cool I thought.  Is this stock?  where does it mount in the bus?

&gt; my understanding is that your bus would not have a church key holder as a 
&gt; stock item.  apparently the engineers at vw thought that the door pockets were 
&gt; the best place to keep church keys.  when smooth, pocketless door panels were 
&gt; made the engineers thought a holder was called for.  my '56 truck has 
&gt; pockets in the door panels for the key (i usually hang it off the turn signal arm 
&gt; cuz i like to listen to it clink when i drive) and my '62 panel has a church 
&gt; key holder and smooth door panels.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,

My '56 Kombi has a small bracket that it slips into located on the front kick 
panel by the drivers door.  It is shaped to accept the male end of the key.  
It is held on the panel by one of the screws that normally hold the panel on.  
I don't know if this is stock or an add on, but my panels are original.  When 
I purchased my bus it was there.
