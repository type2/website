Subject: re:  engine won't start

Thanks for the help with my starting problem.  I'm
settling in with the high tension side of the ignition
system as the problem.  The last thing I did before it

began firing again was clean the distributor.   I'll 
replace the spark plug wires and distributor cap next 
and keep a spare set in the bus.  I replaced the coil 
and condenser but they may have been alright, just
old.

My bus does not like the rain :-)

Thanks again for the help.

John
