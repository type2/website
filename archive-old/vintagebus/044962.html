&lt;&lt; like i said before, i always try to stay righ around 62mph on road trips. 
 but, that cruising rpm seems sooo high. should i get taller tires? &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
With that low of speed tranny best to just get another rebuilt with the 
gearing you want.  Either a 4.125 R&amp;P or the freeway flier 3.88 or even 3.44 
depending on which size of engine and driving you want to do.   Eric&amp;Barb
