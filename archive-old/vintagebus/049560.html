there should be a mention in the bentley about how moving the plate forward
favors 1 and 3 and back favors 2/4. Or the reverse, i forget just now!!

your little 'ski ramp' on the adjuster plate could be worn down, too - that
makes it easy to go into R instead of 2 :P

it sounds scary (and i wouldn't do it right before ya try and drive to
work; nothing beats not finding ANY gear!), but its not that hard. after
fooling w/ mine it shifts MUCH better. while yer there, you should pull the
lever, clean out and replace the old grease, and REALLY you should replace
the little bushings... one goes in front of the lever, and one goes behind,
in the tube. real easy to do.
