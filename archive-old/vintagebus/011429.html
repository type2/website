Just wanted to commiserate a bit here...:)

Daddybus has been on summer hiatus for the last few weeks as summer finally
caught up to us here in the Valley of the Sun. The last couple of weeks I
was driving it to work, there was an itermittant tin-on-tin type rattle that
didn't seem to be the usual loose shroud-screw noise.

The wife mentioned wanting to use the J**p for for running around some
out-of-town guests this next week, so I decided to poke around this morning
at 0600 before the sun got too high.....

I've been having intermittant generator troubles, along with running thru
those cheap generator pullys every six months or so, so I was thinking
generator bearings. Pulled the fanbelt and fired up the engine for a few
seconds, and of course, no rubbing noises. Checked the generator shaft for
in-out, up-down play. Solid. Gave it a spin. Spun well, but something didn't
feel right. Reached around and found that I could rotate the fan about 15
degrees without the generator shaft turning. Bingo.

My guess it that the woodruff key on the front of the shaft sheared, but I
suppose the fan hub could be toast, too. I'll find out when I pull the
engine. The generator is flakey, the rear woodruff slot is about half again
too wide, there are hairline cracks in the pedestal, and now this.

Thanks for listening.
