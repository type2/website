Subject: Re: [VB] roof rack damage

Don't forget that I have a 3/4ths rack FS on the Samba.
I was talking to Everett today and the price that he mentioned is FAR below
what he thought that it was worth.
I figure that it will sell during the show season or locally. Shipping is of
course pretty out rageous on these.

See: http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?alert+200402180857436532
for photos and details. Location Central Phoenix under lock and key.

I'm so old that I can remember when:
'Made in USA' was a concept and a possibility, Marriage was a sacrament intended for making babies, the Passion of Christ was in book format, Republican meant less government, less spending and the pursuit of honesty, &quot;Tax and spend&quot; inferred support of DOMESTIC programs for legal citizens and fruit came without labels. -ellis, 2004
