Subject: Engine Noise with Load

1967 bus, 1600DP Dog-house

Symptom:  Loud engine clatter under load and at high RPM in any gear.

Non-symptoms.  Noise does not occur when:
	1) When engine is revved up w/o load.
	2) Very low RPM range in any gear.
	3) Tranny is in neutral and engine is revved up while moving.
	4) Additionally, there is no tranny &quot;whine&quot;.

Noise Description:

This noise is pretty loud and seems to be transmitted through the 
shifting rod.  i.e. if I hold on to the shifting rod, I can &quot;feel&quot; the 
rhythm of the noise while I listen to it.  Faintly.  Noise seems to be 
getting slightly worse and/or happening in slightly lower RPM ranges 
(which could be my imagination).

Actions taken:

1) Tightened nuts which hold the rubber tranny mounts in place.  One 
was VERY loose, one was somewhat loose.
2) Verified 27mm tranny mount bolts were tight.
3) Verified engine to tranny bolts were tight.
4) Visually verified rubber tranny mounts to be intact (they look fine).

Possible Root Causes (brainstorming):

1) Rubber tranny mounts toast (despite looking ok during visual 
inspection)
2) Engine Heads loose.  Supporting Evidence:
       a) Noise sounds like Thor Hammering around in Engine Compartment 
(Muir Ref).
       b) I know that the head studs are backing out from trying to 
torque my head nuts down to spec ~900 miles ago.
3) Glad nut failing (just a guess: do these things make any noise prior 
to failure or do they just catastrophically fail?)

Other things I did over the weekend which may have affected things but 
probably did not:

     1) Fixed multiple instances of rattling tin shrouding.
     2) Installed top right engine to tranny bolt.
     3) Found other engine to tranny nuts WAY LOOSE (!!!!).  Tightened 
appropriately.
     4) Drove 9 miles with clutch adjusted too tight (tightening engine 
to tranny bolts requires
             backing out the clutch adjustment, which I didn't do).  
Backed off as appropriate.

Things I haven't done:

     1) Checked tranny fluid levels (my 17mm allen was on loan this 
weekend).


I'm thinking it's loose heads, but I don't want to grenade my 
tranny/pressure plate by driving on this if it's something else.

Anyone have any thoughts (or followup questions)?

thanks,
	tom
