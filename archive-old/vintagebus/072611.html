This is an open letter written to my niece and nephews prior to Memorial Day.
It is a reminder for myself and all generations why we, why I celebrate
Memorial Day.

Dear Patrick, Eylse and Nick,
The following URL (web address) is only one location containing history of the
Division in which Grandpa Ellis served.
http://home.st_dot_net.au/~pdunn/ozatwar/120field.htm

Your Grandfather fought in the US Army, 32nd Infantry Division during World War
II. I encourage you all to take the time to really research this and other
sites relating to your fathers', your uncle/aunts and Grandpa Martinez's
military histories.

This weekend is Memorial Day for a reason. Not just a chance for the rich kids
to go jet skiing or camping. This weekend is more that hotdogs and rock
concerts. It is a weekend to remember the past, evaluate the present moment and
project toward a planned future.

Like Grandpa Ellis, many family members have chosen not to talk much about the
experiences that they may have had while in the military. In respect for their
privacy you might simply chose to thank them for their service and sacrifices.

I do not have the honor of calling myself a US military Veteran. I cannot
rightly salute a soldier. I will never do so as that is VERY insulting to those
who really are. Veterans earned their title and know the history of a salute. 
Unfortunately, your mother and I were born and raised in an unusual period of
time. Specifically, I was of age to be drafted into the military JUST as
ex-President Richard Nixon ended the National tradition of the &quot;Draft&quot;. Our
entire country was somewhat relieved and shell-shocked by the sacrifices that
many of your grandfather/father/uncles/aunts had been making for so long. The
people in my high school class were also relieved and strongly influenced by
society to avoid joining the military. Extra honor goes to those who did so at
that time.

Now, thirty-one years later, I recognize that military service has the
potential for life forming experiences and education. In retrospect, I highly
regret not earning the honor of serving. At that time I objected more to the
abuse of the talents and futures of those who were serving by those who used
them for selfish political and business gains. Respect has always existed for
the traditions, institutions and professionalism of the US military personnel.
Veterans have earned the highest respect of all of us. It's funny that by not
wearing uniforms we may not know that we may be standing amongst giants, heroes
and very extraordinary men and women as go out into public places. Not knowing
the experiences and dues paid by these friends, family and strangers is one
more reason for not being prejudiced against others.

I will always continue to fight, in my own way, to protect and defend the honor
and lives of active military personnel around the world. I encourage you to
communicate your support via participation in voting, as you become able, send
letters and email to your representatives in government expressing your
thoughts. Make sure that you too defend the traditions and existing laws of our
Nation. Never let ANY administration, individual or organization dismantle what
veterans and non-veterans have been paying for with blood for more than two
centuries. It is your generation who must now serve one way or another toward
this share goal.

This weekend I will be flying two flags. The Stars and Stripes and a Peace
flag. Some people perceive the peace flag as an insult. I fly both flags
specifically as a prayer for peace in preserving the lives of military around
the world. Peace, after all, is the ultimate goal of most military
organizations. Defense, of peace is the goal, if you will, from those who do
not seek it. The peace flag on my home is also a prayer for our enemies. Jesus
himself instructed us to love our enemies, do god for those who hate you. Lk
6:27.  This is indirect instruction to pray for those who have hearts of hate.
We, in our own way, have the opportunity through our chosen theologies to be
examples for a better way.  It may not seem immediately realistic or practical
in todays world, but we can continue to fight for the changing of hearts
around the world to stop all the violence. The two flags, Peace and USA, will
always be flown in full respect.

Please stop and take a second to thank those people who have served in the
military. They will appreciate it. As I found out, today I had the opportunity
to be the first person to forth-rightly sincerely express my personal thanks to
a Viet Nam era door gunner for his service, sacrifice and valor. I was told
that I was the first person in thirty-one years to do so. He is a well known,
fair well liked, person at my place of employment that happens to be a military
aircraft manufacturer. No one had ever simply stopped and thanked him
personally for his time, trouble and efforts. I was dumbfounded that I, not
being a close friend and family member was the one to recognize him as a hero
in my life. I have the honor to be surrounded by heroes every day.

Also stop and rethink why some people have choose to have Peace stickers on
their clothing or in their vehicles or other places. They may or may not be
military veterans. They may not be the clichi profile of a &quot;hippie&quot; or
peripheral whack-oh as portrayed in the media and literature. They may be
veterans, giants, heroes in their own right, or just people who highly respect
them. They may have fought other battles that we can no longer see or
understand. 

Rethink the meaning of being a pacifist. Peace after all is the goal of the
military. Always be on guard for those who attempt to confuse any political
party with patriotism or label all protest with anarchy. Your liberties may
depend on it. You are generation who must carry on the memories that we
celebrate.
Take care,
Your &quot;Hippy&quot; Uncle Jim


Pass this message on to your cousins/bothers/sisters on your fathers side of
the family as desired.
