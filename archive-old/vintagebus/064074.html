Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?sch=E4fer?=

Hi all,

...in the thralls of a ruthmann preservation, the master cylinder of the
speed control valve is of the brand 'schdfer' with designation '1 H25 49'.
I searched last night a bit on the web and came up with a number of sites
dealing with isetta, citroen, etc.  The isetta falls in the time frame that
I am looking for... but most were in german... damn, and babblefish doing a
poor job.   Might any of you know, or even a friend of a friend of a friend
that might know whom can aid me to fruition?
