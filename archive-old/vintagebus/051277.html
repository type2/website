&gt; The only thing I have run into that might have been at fault was the rubber 
&gt; connector on the 1&amp;2 side of the dual port intake manifold which tore apart 
&gt; as I lifted off the manifold - it could well have been cracked or split and 
&gt; I didn't notice it before. But wouldn't that lean not richen the mix, and 
&gt; wouldn't it affect both 1&amp;2?

Hi Joel,
Yes it would lean the mixture.  Causing that side to get alot hotter.  In 
turn causing the head chamber/s to crack and/or burn valve/s.  Check your 
compression and if really low in #2 compared to the others, then the head is 
suspect.

&gt; I am really tempted to go out and buy some single port heads tomorrow,
&gt; I could then get rid of all those rubber boots and connections and carb 
&gt; adapter on the dual port intake manifold and replace it with one solid from 
&gt; carb to cylinders VW Germany single port intake manifold which I have 
&gt; stashed away for just such a happy occasion.

Since you have a bus and are not looking for drag racing RPMs, that is 
probably the best thing to do!

&gt;&gt;Was offered a Blaupunkt radio/cassette player, shaft mount style, says VW 
and Porsche on the box - sucker doesn't fit! What a weekend I am having! &lt;&lt;

Pre-1967 bus and KG radio holes are the same size.  Bug is differant from 
1958 on.  So you have to make sure the radio fits a pre-1967 bus or KG!
