Here's a pic of me with one of my buses (my old 62 panel with 1776 single
port), this is how loaded they usualy always are.

Well, they're right about maintaining lower end weight when you go to CW
cranks and the extra weight added by the counter weights. But another school
of thought says that if everything is balanced the weight differential won't
matter, to a point. I prefer to keep the heavy factory flywheel and stock
pulley for the extra inertia it gives me. It's harder to lug down under load
than with a lightened flywheel. I really load down my vehicles and I need
that torque.
