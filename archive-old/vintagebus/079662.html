Sounds ugly :o(
Obviously there's a whole lotta panel work to do if
you want to restore it to standard.

&gt; andy - surely the seat mount ##### are the wheel
&gt; arches.
Yup, that's what I meant.
Starts as the wheel arches on either side and runs the
width of the cab.

&gt; good point about the
&gt; spare though.
&gt; i realise they did make a walkthrough at the time,
&gt; but did these have extra 
&gt; support to compensate for the lack of stiffness
&gt; provided by the bulkhead, 
Dunno?
Perhaps with further bracing under the cargo floor in
the same way Karmann reinforced the floors on their
convertables.

&gt; where did they keep the spare?
Again, not sure.
Perhaps the same way many baywindows kept their spare
in a well next to the rear window.
Any hints on these anomalies, guys??

Interestingly, the '77 9-seater Microbus I used to own
had a cavity under passenger front bench for the
spare.
Obviously split buses simply didn't have the room for
such an arrangement.
In a twist of the ridiculous though the slider door
handle on the inside of the '77 didn't work &amp; as all 3
front seats had fixed headrests if you shut the back
door with someone in it and walked away they were
locked in.
My wife actually got trapped there one day in our
driveway &amp; had to use her mobile to ring me inside the
house so I'd come &amp; release her.
The ultimate child proof lock!
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
