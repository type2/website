I'm trying to sort out a mess of wiring under the dash and noticed this 
little box with many wires protruding from it which looks very corroded. 
What is this thing called so I can replace it and why don't I see it on 
any of the wiring diagrams I have been able to find? The bus has been 
converted to 12V, was this added then?



Thanks,
