Subject: scraps wanted

Hi All,

I really want to start to try a few ideas I have about restoring og
commercial door panels.  I've collected a few pairs but all need repair but
none are junk enough to hack into pieces for a bumbling fool like myself to
try a few techniques... So, I turn my sights on this ever so great list to
see what I can find.

So, what have You in the line of scraps from late 50's to 61 commercial
pressed fiber door panels and front kick panels?  Open to all scraps larger
than 4 square inches.  Of course, if you have a mint set of door panels just
lying around after your wcm resto, i'd be glad to take those off your hands
as well :-)


TIA


David
