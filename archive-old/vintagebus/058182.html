&gt; I am in the process of rebuilding the Solex/Bocar 30 PICT 1 that is on the 
&gt; '68 Beetle 1500 in my '64.  The last time I ran it on the Bus, it was 
&gt; visibly leaking around the throttle shaft and from the air horn/body seam - 
&gt; a fine mist of gas formed on the outside of the carb in these areas.  I 
&gt; noticed this after trying
&gt; to adjust it so it wouldn't run so rich; there was lots of black smoke and 
&gt; soot from the tailpipe and it seemed to get poor gas mileage.  My theory is 
&gt; that it had been set to run rich to try and compensate for the leak around 
&gt; the throttle shaft.

Hi Matt,
Sounds like you have too much fuel pressure from the fuel pump or the float 
and/or shut off valve in the float chamber of the carburetor are bad.

&gt; When I first tore it down, the little brass kitchen-sink-faucet  accelerator 
&gt; pump squirter, at the very top of the body, just came out with finger 
&gt; pressure.  There is a little flange around the bottom - I am assuming I can 
&gt; just press this back into place
&gt; with a screwdriver or similar on the flange?  Should I use any 
&gt; sealing/locking goop on this?

That accelerator nozzle has a tapered base on it which one should tap with a 
slot tip screwdriver and hammer into place to lock it there.  You must first 
aim this nozzle to spray through the opening of the lower throttle butterfly 
valve when it first opens.  This nozzle should came back out with a little 
twisting pulling by hand, but you really do not want it to loose and pop out 
to get sucked up by one of the P&amp;Cs!

&gt; I had the throttle shaft bore rebushed at a local shop.  When they did this, 
&gt; however, they just machined off the peened portion of the throttle plate 
&gt; screws.  I could easily back out the screws with a small screwdriver.  This 
&gt; means to me that I need to get some longer screws and properly peen them - 
&gt; Loctite would _probably_ work but it costs a piston or a valve to find out 
&gt; for sure. 

Unless you know that Loctite works wil fuel bathing it we would just peen the 
screws.  Installing brass screws would make it far easier to remove them next 
time.

&gt; For grins I went ahead and removed the throttle plate and took out the 
&gt; throttle shaft.  The brass bushing on the left (throttle lever) side stayed 
&gt; in the carb, but the bushing on the right (accelerator pump) side came out 
&gt; with the shaft!  It is steel and knurled on its OD; the shaft bore has 
&gt; obviously been drilled for it but it wasn't seated down.  Can I just tap 
&gt; this back in with a suitable drift or is this likely to cause me problems?

That does not sound good!  Does the bushing fit snuggly in the bore when you 
try to push it in by hand?  If so you probably can get away with just 
pressing it back in.  We would apply high temp silicon sealant to the outer 
diameter to help prevent vaccum leaks there.

&gt; I checked the body/air horn mating by putting the air horn on the body with 
&gt; no screws or gasket; I could see a little bit of light in the gap.  I 
&gt; screwed the air horn down with 5 screws (still no gasket) and tried some 
&gt; feeler gauges in the gap; I can fit an .004 inch gauge in the gap on the 
&gt; left side and front of the float bowl, and an .006 gauge in the gap under 
&gt; and just behind the fast idle cam!  Will the gasket take up this slack, or 
&gt; is more gap than the gasket can fill?  Would Permatex on the gasket or 
&gt; instead of the gasket help?  Or should I be looking at lapping (?) down the 
&gt; airhorn or body to get a flat fit?

Best to just use the gasket.  Using sealant will just make roadside repairs 
harder.  Lapping out the gaps or at least down to .003 should do.  It sounds 
like the DPO of  this carburetor just torqued the heck out of these upper 
screws instead of replacing the upper gasket or fixing some other leakage 
problem.

&gt; For now I am going to run with the jets that were in it, because I want to 
&gt; see how fixing the other problems this carb has helps before I fool with 
&gt; the jets.  I am running the stock oil-bath air cleaner and a stock 
&gt; late-model exhaust (single outlet on the right side of the muffler instead 
&gt; of the left, with damper pipe and
&gt; tail pipe running to left rear).  Right now it has an 0120 main, g55 pilot, 
&gt; and 125z air correction/emulsion tube.

The main jet sounds a bit too big and the air correction too small.  
Definitely check out the jetting data for the German version of this 
carburetor in the &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manuals.

  The Without Guesswork and Bentley manuals suggest that there is also a 
pilot 
&gt; jet air bleed, a pump injection tube (aka?) fuel jet for pump, and a power 
&gt; fuel jet.  I think the pilot air bleed is the little brass disc just above 
&gt; where the pilot air jet screws in, visible from the top of the main body.  
&gt; The pump injection tube is, I think, the kitchen-sink-faucet bit that 
&gt; sprays down into the throat.
&gt; 
We are away from our collection of &quot;Official Service Manuals&quot; right now, but 
that sounds correct if you mean this jet air bleed can only be viewed with 
the top of the carburetor off.  the pump injection tube is the same as the 
brass accelerator nozzle.

&gt; The only jet I'm confused on is the power fuel jet.  When I look down into 
&gt; the float bowl, I can see a brass thing pointing down, just inboard of the 
&gt; right wall where the accelerator pump is.  It has threads inside it.  When 
&gt; I look into the hole in the 
&gt; accelerator pump cavity, I can see the &quot;nose&quot; of this brass bit.  Is this 
&gt; the power fuel jet?  Is it supposed to come out?  It looks like I would 
&gt; need to thread something down into the top of it (inside the float bowl) to 
&gt; pull it out. 

That should be the one way valve and inlet for the accelerator nozzle AKA 
pump injection tube.
