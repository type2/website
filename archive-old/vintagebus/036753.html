This happened to me on long island a few years ago. 4 guys renting a house in a heavily conservative
republican neighborhood. The neighbors didn't like me out at the curb with a motor on the street, working
by a living room lamp on an extention cord in the middle of the night. They reported us and the town sent
a nasty letter to the landlord about my unregistered 80 van and 2 66 vans. The upshot was the landlord
evicted us. I stayed behind an extra week to hold an illegal yard sale. Had to junk one of my 66s because
I had no place to put it!!!!!! I would suggest agressively reporting the other neighbors for lawn jockeys etc.
if they come after you.
