Subject: leaking crew cab

Hi List,
I was wondering if there are &quot;typical&quot; spots where
water gets into a spittie, more specifically, a crew
cab. Mine has all new weather stripping but everytime
it rains or I wash it, it gets considerable water in
the floorboard of the rear seat section. I know one
place it gets in when I'm drivning in heavy rains is
through the upper fresh air vents. I'm gonna try to
address that issue this afternoon with a new seal up
there. As to the rear floor, any ideas would be
greatly appreciated. Oh, BTW, when it rains and when I
wash it, I seem to always get water in the parcel
tray. Please respond if'n ya have any ideas 'bout
this.

Thanks,
3DPete

p.s. I live in Oklahoma and spotted a pinkish colored
split bus close to where I live. Didn't know there was
any around. Any possibility this was a Listee??
