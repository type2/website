Subject: Re: [VB] Passing of a friend

I know how you feel. I lost my best friend and by far
the best german bus accessory, Ben, a German
Shorthair, in November. I raised him from a pup and he
too grew up traveling in my 65 Westfalia. That dog was
more traveled than most people I know and I swear if
he had thumbs I would have had to hide the keys
because I think he would have taken her out when I
wasn't looking! Hang in there, he would!

&gt; I can finally write about this.
&gt; 
&gt; I met him 3 years ago at High Country Bus Fest.  He
&gt; was in the company of 2 very lovely ladies but he
&gt; caught my eye even more than they did.  I remember
&gt; thinking 'Wow - he's beautiful'.  I tried to get to
&gt; know him but he remained aloof, preferring the
&gt; company of others.  I met him at several other
&gt; campouts, always with the same 2 pretty ladies.  He
&gt; seemed wary of me for some reason, why I didn't
&gt; know.
&gt; 
&gt; About a year ago I went to pick up a bus from one of
&gt; the aforementioned pretty ladies and there he was
&gt; again.  I left busless, but he came home with me. 
&gt; He seemed uneasy during the ride, moving around and
&gt; looking out the window.
&gt; 
&gt; We got to know each other slowly, as most good
&gt; relationships start.  He stayed at the farm while I
&gt; commuted back and forth from Charleston and work to
&gt; my little postage stamp farm in Lenoir, NC.  Every
&gt; Friday when I walked in the door there he was to
&gt; greet me, always happy that I was home and never
&gt; mind what kind of week he may have had.
&gt; 
&gt; If nothing else in the whole wide world, he liked to
&gt; ride in the buses.  I'd ask if he wanted to go with
&gt; me and he'd be at the bus before I was.  He
&gt; tolerated the baywindow camper, but his true love
&gt; (besides me) was the splittie.  He'd sit tall and
&gt; proud, and I know other people would look at him
&gt; riding in the bus with me and they'd marvel too.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of you east coast bussers may have seen him
&gt; either with Andrea and Chris, or with my family and
&gt; I.
&gt; 
&gt; You see, Rocky was much more than a dog, he was a
&gt; great bus person and a great friend.  I have other
&gt; dogs, but it just isn't the same.  I know there are
&gt; other bus dogs out there and have had the honor of
&gt; meeting many of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Driving the bus just isn't the same without him.

&gt; &quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
&gt; mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more
&gt; intrigued
&gt; by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite
&gt; well
&gt; for themselves.&quot;
