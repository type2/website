Drove down Friday evening from Fresno in a caravan with Thom, Harry Houck
from Fresno, Craig from Modesto, and Nate from Lemoore. My 6v 66 hardtop
Deluxe decided not to charge the battery with the headlights on..... had to
drive thru LA on parking lights.

A truck driver pulling a set of duals decided he wanted to be [illegally] in
the same spot in the fast lane that I was. I ended up clipping off a sign
post in the center meridian. Luckily there was no holes or bridge abuttments
there! I have a permanent mark on my otherwise straight nose.

On a happy note:
I want to thank Izzy for donating the safari windows to the raffle. My bus
thanks me for buying the winning ticket!
