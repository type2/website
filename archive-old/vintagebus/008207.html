Hi there,

Am looking at replacing my rear exhaust apron on my '67. Is the Wolfsburg
West repro any good in terms of fit and finish? Or as usual, should one look
for a good rust free-used original if that is still possible?? Comments??

Secondly, on backing the bus out of the garage today, I heard a light
&quot;metallic click/twang&quot; sound and sounds like it is coming from the rear of
the vehicle. It occurs 1 to 3 times every 20-60 feet and ocassionally not at
all. Cant' hear it in forward gear and appears to occur only in reverse. Any
ideas??

Thanks for your input.....

Scott
'67 Westy
