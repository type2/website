ya-hoo 3 days till departure and I can't wait, all I got to do is put the
new engine in the double door and we're ready to roll, good way to break it
in, put it in, break in the cam, then drive 200 miles fully loaded pulling
the trailer with roof racks loaded to Jerome, wish me luck.  This will be an
interesting experiment, 1776 single port, big valve heads, custom grind cam,
6.7 to 1 compression (love those copper head gaskets), Thunderbird header,
duel Kadrons (yes on a single port) and I did find a couple more single port
Kadron manifolds. All this powering my 3.88, 77  4th gear Rancho trans mated
to big nut (rebuilt RGB), this will make a really interested run, tire size
195/14 Nanking 8 ply tires.
