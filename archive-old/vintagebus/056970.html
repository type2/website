Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Aw, heck, I drive my stock '71 bus in the SoCal environment all the time.
Stay in the right lane, speed around 58-62 and never have a problem.

Lots of vehicles do the same thing, including most of the trucks.
Remember that the truck speed limit in California is 55 still, so most of
them run 60-62 if they want to avoid conversations with John Law, so buses
fit right in.

I suppose I could feel peer pressure to go faster, but I enjoy my bus too
much to shorten the trip!  Just because someone else is driving 90 is no
reason that I have to as well.

&gt; &gt;Hate to say it, but the vintagebus_dot_com panel has been relegated to
&gt; &gt;backup, show, and Home Depot duty.   It's just not competitive in
&gt; &gt;this region's traffic environment.
&gt;
&gt; The ONE time I went to California for D*sney, OCTO, The Classic, we
&gt; took the modern mini-van. All I kept telling my wife was &quot;How the
&gt; F*CK do they drive a VW Bus on these highways!&quot;. The Highways I was
&gt; on in California were absolutely the worst roads I've ever driven on.
&gt; Seems like there's so much traffic they don't have a chance to fix
&gt; 'em. People doin 90 on horribly torn up bumpy &quot;highways&quot;.
