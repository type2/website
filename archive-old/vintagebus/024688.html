Subject: Gas Heater - value?

I have a 6-volt gas heater that has been sitting in my shed for years. I
guess I am never going to install it, so Id like to sell it but I have
no idea what its worth. Can anybody advise me of the value of it?
It is an Eberspacher BN2. Seems to be complete, with sheet metal,
mounting bracket, fuel pump, wiring with dashboard switch. It is in fair
condition. The exhaust pipe is rusted through, and the flex hoses have
been chewed by mice and will have to be replaced. It was working when it
was removed from the bus it was in, but has been sitting in a cardboard
box in a sometimes-damp shed for several years.
