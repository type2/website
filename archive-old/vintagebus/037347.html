&lt;&lt; I am looking for a new or new to me bearing that goes into the front axle
 beam in a 67 bus.&gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Would that be a inner or outer needle bearing?  We would also like to hear if
both of these needle bearings are availible new,

&lt;&lt; How do you pull them out if you dont have a slide puller? &gt;&gt;
You have to make a slide pull.  Using a thick washer file two parallel sides
of the washer flat (So it looks like a &quot;0&quot;.) and so that this will fit
through the needle bearing.  while the two ends you have left alone will grab
the bearing and pull it out.  Then make the hole of the large washer is more
of a slot or use a washer with a large hole with a smaller washer to fit the
larger washer to the long bolt you need to go through them.

 &lt;&lt;What year did they switch to this instead of the bushing?  &gt;&gt;
The inner bushing was replaced with needle bearings for the M215 1963 only
one ton suspension and 1964 ambulances chassi # 1 144 282 to 215 036 650.
Then in OCT 65 from chassi # 215 036 651 these needle bearings became
standard for all model of bus.   Eric&amp;Barb
