My first '65 came with Gold/Brown/Orange shag carpet with a tapestry
(like you see in far east import shops. Also in head shops. Er, uh, so I
hear) Actually adapted nicely, using the original metal bows that held
the original headliner. Probably pretty awesome in its day. I'm sure a
hookah, some big pillows and beaded curtains once completed the picture.

&gt; Well, my custom '67 (ex-camper) is coming along. Now starting the interior.
&gt; Has anyone come up with a unique/custom ceiling idea other than paneling or a
&gt; headliner?
