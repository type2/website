Subject: Re: Floor repair

The outter sections are repoed 1 is about 10 inches and the other side is
about 12 inches . the cargo side one is avalible from Wolfsburg west
pn/211801404KX, priced at $42.00. The other side is Avalible from RMMW pn/
211801403EX, at 49.95, they also list the right side at that price , you
might ck WW and see they might have it as well and save you a couple bucks.
Either place has the complete halfs of the cargo floors as well. i normaly
run WW stuff more than RMMW. Personal; preference, only.
The whole rocker and floor section assembly from RMMW for the passengers
side list in my catalog for $119.00 thats the one Leard was talking about ,
PN/211801404CS. hope this helps.  Oh btw i lap the floors only about 3/8 of
and inch is all. P mail me if i can help ,,later
