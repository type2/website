&gt; Hi Joe,
&gt; If you are getting enough oil pressure to keep out
&gt; the oil pressure light 
&gt; then you should not be having bearing problems
&gt; unless your engine case oil 
&gt; passages are partly or completely blocked.  Did you
&gt; clean them out and make 
&gt; sure that oil passed through all of them easily?

Yea I was thinkin the same thing.... the sending unit
trips open _at_ I think 7 to 10lbs. That should be plenty
of pressure &amp; flow to keep it lubed up at an idle for
break-in purposes. Im sure Ill be corrected if wrong:)
That is unless you were to put one h*ll of a load on
the engine _at_ an idle, but not probable. Id check the
oil passages to the badly scored or burnt bearings to
see if they are clear:)
