Got my bus back from the mechanic today. I could never get it running so 
I had it towed and Fred fixed it. Sort of. He told me it ran good but 
needed a muffler real badly. So I paid and drove it home. The yellow 
light would not stay off. According to Muir, this is oil, right?? I only 
drove it a few blocks. It sounds like hell but I dont know yet how much 
of that is muffler.

well, the right hand warning light is supposedly originally green (certain
years), but generally is faded to yellow.  well, also the silly little see
through plastic colour doohickeys often drop out (must a tuned in and turned
on), anyway, that is if the wiring is hooked up right, which is generally
is... but you may find it isn't.   Check that is the oil light by turning the
key to the on postion, and having a friend look at the dash while you unplug
/replug the wire from the sender- the light should go on and off  (it should
go on if you ground it to the case to- which can tell you if your sender is
bad if the light doesn't come on when you turn the key on).  okay, after being
really confusing here I mean to say if it sounds really funky don't drive it.
First, check the oil.    The left hand light is the electrical light- if that
is the one you are not getting juice (either electrical problem or broken or
slipping fan belt).
 next  put the bus in neutral and turn the engine round with a wrench on the
generator nut till the crank pully has gone round twice- that is a complete
engine cycle.    Clunks are bad.  Anything feeling funky is bad.   It should
be harder to turn (compression) during part of each half cycle of the crank
pulley (four half crank pully turns for four cylinders/pistons equals 2 crank
pulley turns = the motor cycle) 

The muffler being bad would make a yucky noise, but not make the light come
on.   

if you run the bus, feel for exhaust leaks  around the muffler- air will blow
ove rthe cylinders, but not around wher ethe muffler bolts on or thrugh cracks
in the muffler.   Any holes there?
