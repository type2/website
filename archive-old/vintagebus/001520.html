I have for sale a BRAND NEW (still tied together with WCM plastic) rear
hatch seal for a 50-63 bus.  This seal goes on the door itself.  BusDepot's
price is $13.95.  I'll sell it for $11.00 with FREE shipping - I only
stipulate that I get to send it as cheap as possible - I'm sure you
understand.  I'm open for private email offers as well.
