Okay guys, I took 20 pics of it, came home, downloaded a thumbnail program,
tried to figure it out, and hopefully put up a page that works.  Try
http://www.jps_dot_net/pperez/page.html and let me know if the pics come up.  I
didn't have time to figure out how to ad captions to the pics but I think
most of the pics are &quot;worth a thousand words&quot; anyway.  I will explain that
the bus comes with 2 rear corner sections that I have a shot of.  There's
also a pic of a section of the _sub_floor_ that is rotted away in 12&quot;squares
at all 4 corners.  Doglegs are ok (I've seen worse), rockers are good, rear
wheel wells need to be replaced.  Looks like some rot around the front wind
screens.  Lower front nose rott.  Passenger rear corner crunched and rotted.
Dent down passenger side starting at rear most side door.  A lot of things
screwed into strange places in the intereior, most likely for hanging things
since the PO was a land surveyor.  Probably more you can see by looking at
the pics.  Good things are:  except for what I mentioned, very straight
otherwise.  All windows good and frames better than mine.  Played with the
ragtop and it worked well.  Original headliner is excellent.  Seats (no
middle) are in good shape (no springs showing).  More things good I can't
think of right now because I'm starving for dinner.  Just check out the
pics.
