&gt; two big screws per hinge or 4/door.    yes they can be a bear.  dont tweak
&gt; the screw or you get to drill them out :(


 Ok, now I am nervous about doing this. What is an impact driver and where
can I find one? And how do I keep from losing that backing plate? A friend
told me it would not be cool if that backing plate fell off.....
How do I know when I need to stop trying with the screwdriver? And when you
guys speak of drilling it out, are you referring to a process like using an
&quot;easy out&quot;?
