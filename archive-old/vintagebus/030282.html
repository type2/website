Subject: Do many find the Original Owner?

Hello, list.

I am still buzzing over my find.  While rooting around behind the kick
panels in the nose of my '65 camper (of some variety) bus trying to find
the source of an electrical problem, I reached behind the styrofoam
sheet semi-glued to the front bodywork and pulled out, lo and behold,
the original VW service booklet, complete with about half the coupons
still in it.  Dealer stamps for the missing ones.  It confirms that the
bus came from Seattle originally, before winding up with me in Tampa.

On the last page is the owner information page with everything filled
out, completely with that funky old style telephone number, too.  The
kicker is this:  Yahoo People Search says that someone by the same name
as this owner in the booklet still lives at the same address in
Seattle!  To me, this is way cool.  I am planning on writing the fellow
with an SASE to pick his brain about what he can remember about the bus;
mostly as to what conversion company he had because the huge pop-top I
have is completely unlike any I ever seen in my trolling on the web.  I
wonder how original it is, too.  There's a compressed gas heater I also
wonder about.  Anything he'd like to reminisce about I'd love to hear.
I'll send him some pix, too.  If he tells me to f_at_#k off, that's ok; I'm
not a stalker!

Has anyone met the original owner of their bus, one that has changed
hands several times?  Can good information be gleaned?  Or do most can't
be bothered?

Michael
'65 (soon to know what kind) camper
