Hey Guy,  sounds like you are getting steamed and that
is making you miss the main point of this thread.  The
intial post was a guy asked what they were worth,
because he is putting an offer on one.  All the puck
owners replied they are worth bazillions!!....That is
a biased opinion i figure and thru in my 2
cents...(weather you like my post of not is not that
what this list is about?!)  

Any how, the little pucks were worth about $800-$1500
before Jim bought flaunted about and it was stuck in
BIG VW mags.  As we know ANYTHING that hits the mags
is instantly worth quadruple its actual value.  Thanks
to the japanese ect ect....  So now the price of the
pucks shoots up thousands.  Its a bit of a false
temporary value I see it.

Now back to the thread's point.  This fellow was
asking what to offer.  My reply and point to this
fellow was, they are not worth thosands and thousands
$800-$1500 is about what they brought before the
'hype' and when the 'hype' cools down that is probably
what they'll bring again.

Basically I was tellin the guy do not offer $4500
offer $1000 and I am sure the owner would crap when he
hears someone wants to give him 1G for a little crappy
kinda old trailer. Yes, I own one too and yea even for
$1000 they are pretty crappy.  Its just the only damn
thing light enough to tow behind my corvair van (just
kidding)

&gt; &lt;&lt; Don't cha just love how its only the 'puck'

&gt; 
&gt; So what you are saying is:  Isn't it peculiar how
&gt; folks who own, and 
&gt; therefore have an intimate knowledge of, and years
&gt; of experience of camping 
&gt; with, and have a greater overall knowledge of, Like
&gt; the Puck and find it to 
&gt; be great addition to our enjoyment of the VW Hobby. 
&gt; Your point would be 
&gt; what?  
&gt; 
&gt; As far as value, neither Cowboy Jim E., nor Rchase,
&gt; nor myself have our 
&gt; Puck's for sale so current value would mean what to
&gt; us?  Any figures 
&gt; presented were purely historical, not speculative.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't like them, fine.  Don't buy one.  But
&gt; your approval isn't 
&gt; prerequisite to someone else wanting one or enjoying
&gt; the one they have.
