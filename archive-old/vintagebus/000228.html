&lt;&lt; Well I went back out there and readjusted the brakes again.   Success.  I
 _thought_ I had adjusted them before; they were really not even close (live

Hi Richard,
Good to hear you have them working.  Dual MCs have to be bled differantly 
than the single MCs.  Plus for the duals it really helps to adjust the brake 
shoes way too tight, then bleed brakes, then lastly go around to readjust the 
shoes to barely drag on the drums.  If it has been seven years since the 
system has been worked on it is a really good idea to remove the MC 
dissassemble and clean/polish it out of any road dust that has gotten into it 
and/or light corrosion.  The same can and should be done with any of the 
slave cylinders without removing them from thier places on the brake backing 
plates.  This and flushing out the entire brake system should be done about 
every 30,000 miles or 3-5 years which ever comes first and depending how 
moist of an enviroment you drive it in.   Eric&amp;Barb
