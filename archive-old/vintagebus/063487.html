Subject: Re: [VB] (boot replacement) additionally...


 Arthur,

When applying the seam sealer, apply it all the way around the insides
of both the large end and the small end as well - make sure all surfaces
are clean and oil-free first. You don't want any leaks anywhere, and
replacing the boots is messy enough as is.
