well, getting different answers is because of model years .  in this case they are irrelevant- and can be confusing when people try to squish changes into model years. if your truck has the flat decklid, it came with the round glass taillight w/screws on outside like 58-61 

If it came with the brakelight decklid, it came with the plastic bulby taillights with the screws in the engine compartment and reflectors below the taillights.  unless it has semaphores as well as the BLDL, in which case it has the flat glass taillight with one screw terminal and the screws inside the engine compartment

off hand the flat aka &quot;58 decklid&quot; was used from about ch #250,000 till about #350 000, meaning from about april 57.  some 58s had one kind of taillight, some another.   so is your vin below or above 250 000?  do you have reflectors of indents w/ little square holes for reflectors under the level of the battery tray in the rear corners?

hope this helps.

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; I've been shopping around for a set of tail lights for my 57 truck (that I'm 
&gt; hoping to  get on the road soon), but some places are telling me that the 58 
&gt; tail lights are the same as the 57 year.  That doesn't sound quite right, can 
&gt; anyone help me out of this dilemma. Also would 6.70x15 tires be ok for the 
&gt; truck?
&gt;                                                                       Thanks
