Subject: Re: [VB] Fouling Plugs?

Hi Andrew,
Check the fuel pump rod for proper top hieght or you have too much fuel 
pressure which will push the shut off valve open and the float down!  Did you 
install the gasket onto the shut off valve before you torqued it back into the carb 
top?  What jets are you running, did you put them all back in/tight/right 
place?  Are you running a stock aircleaner?  Running non-stock muffler can also 
affect carb jetting, but usually to the leaner/hotter side.
