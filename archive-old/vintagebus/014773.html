None of the noses or rockers I've seen the inside of had any significant 
primer on them.  Unless they left the bus in the primer dip for a significant
period of time, it wouldn't get into all of the nooks and crannies.  I
guess the bus would have to sit in the primer bath for at least 5 minutes,
and be agitated in some fashion, to get the air trapped in the rockers, 
frame side channels, and rose to bubble out.

&gt; I was looking thru the &quot;new&quot; bus bok by Keith Seume yesterday.
&gt; And I saw at least two pictures of busses being diped in primer, 
&gt; so were the nose and rockers air tight?
