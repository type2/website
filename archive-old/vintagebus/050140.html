&gt;P.S.  One of Ken's filters on the list won't allow you to use the word
&gt;&quot;Archives&quot; in a message subject, why we are all using &quot;Arch*ves&quot; or
&gt;&quot;Arch!ves&quot; hehe.

It ain't my filter, it's Dolan's. He is even more paranoid than me, and
that requires truly Homeric dedication. =^)

Re-emphasizing:

--This search engine (unlike most and unlike any of the others we've had)
is very STINGY. It will only match what you SAY, it will not try to
anticipate your needs.

So &quot;tran&quot; will only match &quot;tran&quot;, it will NOT match &quot;trans&quot; or &quot;tranny&quot; or
&quot;transmission&quot;. You should tend toward short, literal queries.

--It took Stephen weeks to parse this all out (there was a hodgepodge of
different file and spool formats and it was basically a bitch) but he has
succeeded in getting ALL KNOWN AIRCOOLED BUS LIST TRAFFIC into one single
searchable archive. Around 90,000 messages since 1994 and every damn day
since. So,

--PLEASE USE THIS RESOURCE early and often.

--When Stephen says &quot;super search&quot; he means that it will be possible to
search all the databases at once with one query. It ain't there yet but
it's coming. This is just the greatest thing since jumper cables.

--Here is the URL again:

&gt;I have all the messages on-line, but I'm still indexing for the super
&gt;search (should be ready end of Monday).  In separate piles, we have all
&gt;the e-mail messages up from __April 1994 - June 1998__!  something like
&gt;90,000 messages about Type2's...
&gt;
&gt;A few tips:
&gt;
&gt;  o   Separate each word by a space on body and subject searches, do not
&gt;use commas, special words, or other punctuation.
&gt;  o   Try a few variations of your search.  Enter &quot;brakes rear&quot; on the
&gt;[Body] field, and if that doesn't find what you want, try &quot;brake rear
&gt;drum&quot; or other variations (notice that &quot;brakes&quot; and &quot;brake&quot; are not the
&gt;same!)
&gt;  o   If you aren't finding what you want, try LESS words.  Try just
&gt;&quot;rear drum&quot; instead of &quot;brake rear drum&quot; -- too many words will restrict
&gt;the search too much.  Remember, there is no automatic word variation
&gt;matching, try both &quot;rear drum&quot; and &quot;rear drums&quot; -- the person who wrote
&gt;the message you want may have only used pleural!
&gt;  o   Once you get to a message you like, on the individual message,
&gt;there is a link to show all of the same messages with the same subject
&gt;(thread).  You can also see all the messages from the same author (as
&gt;long as they didn't change their e-mail address &lt;grin&gt;).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From most places in the search, you should be able to bookmark and/or
&gt;paste links into e-mail to get to the same place.  That was a primary
&gt;goal of the archives... so that you can post messages pointing to
&gt;individual message or a thread.
&gt;
&gt;  ========= Example 1, Individual Message =======
&gt;Example 1:  Simple example, you can jump right to a specific message.  I
&gt;used the [Subject] field and put &quot;Hooper Christmas&quot;.  I had the [Mailing
&gt;List] pull down on &quot;Type2 (December 1996 - current)&quot;.    I then read the
&gt;message and pasted the link here...
&gt;http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/sm.asp?ID=14108&amp;ml=1
&gt;
&gt;  ========= Example 2, Search Link =======
&gt;Example 2:  Here is a bookmark after a search.  In this case, I used the
&gt;'standard' search and put the words &quot;clip brake&quot; in the [Body] field and
&gt;selected &quot;Type2 (December 1996 - current)&quot; on the [Mailing List] field..
&gt;Once the results came up, I pasted the link into this mail message.
&gt;http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/default.asp?body=clip+brake&amp;sub=&amp;ml=1
&gt;
&gt;  ========= Example 3, thread link =========
&gt;Example 3:  Here is a link to a specific message thread.  I got here by
&gt;searching &quot;clip brake&quot; and then I saw a message I liked (second one
&gt;down, from Andy McKinley).  I read that message then pressed the &quot;Show
&gt;All Messages With Subject&quot;.  Then of course, I created the link.
&gt;  (The follow line needs to be all together, you may have to past it
&gt;together if it split.  It starts with &quot;http&quot; and ends with &quot;2775&quot; at the
&gt;end.)
&gt;http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/default.asp?ml=1&amp;exactsub=Re%3A+Fixing+rea
&gt;r+brakes+on+a+%2775
&gt;
&gt;Try to keep your questions about the archive to me in private mail,
&gt;don't post archive problems or issues to the main list.
