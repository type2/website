Which came first - the M plate or the bus? Were plates created based on
factory orders from dealers  and if so perhaps were a few held up until an
order was complete? Or was an order canceled and the plate set aside until
another simular order was placed and then the plate put back in the stack to
be produced ? Remember this is VW and they were cheapskates.

Based on factory photos in various books and on webpges, it seems appearant
that many types of buese were being produced on the line at the same time.
There appears to be no real pattern in the order things were being produced.
For instance, they did not build trucks on Monday, highroofs, on Tuesday,
Deluxe's on Wednesday, etc.

Or.......

Could Hans have been on his way to the floor with a box of plates to give
them to the production supervisor when he stopped by the stroodle table for
a break? While eating stroodle he got some filling on Craig's plate. Feeling
silly and not seeing any napkins nearby he slipped the plate into his pocket
thinking that he would clean it up and put it in the next box to go down
after lunch. Hans forgot about the M plate and a week later Uma found it
while doing the wash.

&quot;Hans.&quot;she screamed, &quot;Have you been cheating on your diet again?&quot;
Hans replied with a hardy &quot;Nine, mine Love.&quot;
Uma produced the M-plate with stroodle scoo all over it.
 Hans shrank back with embarassment.
&quot;Hans, you clean up this M-plate this very minute and make certain you
remember to bring it back to work tomorrow.&quot;
Hans sank away in silence.
The very next day Hans returned to work with the cleaned up M-code plate and
slipped in with the others that he had prepared for the day.

The VIN was registered after the bus finished production not when the plate
was made. Maybe :)
