Subject: RE: [VB] type 4  cooler in a barndoor

What happens to the volume of air passing through the larger cooler? VW
again designed the doghouse shroud, the flappers and thermostat for a
specific purpose. Inside the doghouse shroud there in a slot which directs
air over the cooler, this was designed for a certain amount of air, widening
the doghouse tin will reduce the pressure going through the cooler thus the
volume of air, so it seems you would be relying on the extra size of the
type4 cooler for dissipation (heat)instead of volume.
Clara saz she has noticed a big temp difference, VW Howard doesn't have
gauges on his, but I still seem to run as cool as he does, we'll tell this
summer. After the next few weekends shows (I'll bye doing three weekends in
a row), I am going to sacrifice 3 oil coolers to count fins, passages and
measure oil capacities of the three, 1 type1 doghouse cooler, 1 type3
doghouse cooler and 1 type4 oil cooler, this will answer all questions as to
size and cooling ability, I will the forward these numbers to the list math
wiz George Lyle, and let him calculate the total cooling ability of each
cooler, maybe someone can measure the cubic inches of a standard doghouse
and the cubic inches of the type4 conversion, find the cfm of air put out by
the large VW fan at different rpm's, find out what the specs are on the
amount of air passing through the doghouse, then we'll come up with some
serious numbers.

if you really want to get blown away, the oil ports (to cooler) on a type
four engine are smaller then the large oil port cases (type1) and they pass
oil through a filter also.

this is my own opinion and is based on my own thoughts
and what I have listened to other people say for the last 2 years.





Subject: [VB] typeIV cooler


If you look at the coolers side by side it should be pretty clear which
will cool better. The type IV has extra rows of cooling with very
similar spacing. In this case more surface area should fairly simply
dissipate more heat. As for hacking up all that tin to put in the type
IV cooler, it is really not that involved. The other thing to remember
is when was the last time you wore out your tin? Once you build this set
up it will last for as long as you want. Simply replace the coolers when
you do the engine. I agree with E&amp;B as I can't see a difference between
the type three cooler and type one other than that pressure sender.
You talk to your &quot;reliable source&quot; and find out exactly what difference
he knows about. It would be interesting to know.
Hope this is helpful,
