&gt; Ok, for my info and for others out there as ignorant as me, which are
&gt; the kingpins and which are the linkpins?

The link pins (the ones you took out and put back in) go through the
king pins.
The pin part of the king pins is not visible. The lower and the upper
king pins are pressed together between the bushings of the steering
knuckle.
The king pins have to be pressed apart. They can be together real tight.
Hydraulics required.
The king pins are a forging, partly grinded and hardend. Thats why there
is no reproduction available, which means the big bucks for an org VW
part. They are still available though.

To do a king pin job right you need:

hydraulic press and adaptors
guided reamer (pre 63)
guided press in tool, probably rarely used in US due to low quality 	of
overall workmanship (63 - 67)
2 bushings
2 kingpins (1 lower, 1 upper)
1 thrust washer
usually 1 new or used distance piece (4 sizes available, depending on
individual requirement)
1 press in cap

I hope I did not forget anything. This is all for 1 side.

US rebuilders ream in the bushings on all pins, because they work with
oversizes. They grind down the king pins to undersizes, but do not
reharden them.
German rebuilders rebuild only with new parts. That why they are twice
as expensive.

If you really take care of your king pins when new, they will last
forever. But who does.
To test the king pins lift up the vehicle and put your finger on the
joint between the pins and the knuckle.
Have someone move the wheel (up down). Feel the movement. There
shouldn't be any.
Good luck.

BTW this is only a real problem, if your pins are really worn out, or if
you are totally overperfectionistic like me. Or if you really want your
car to handle well.
