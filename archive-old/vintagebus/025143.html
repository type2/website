I owe everyone that went to everybus a big apology. It was my duty (self
inflicted) to bring T shirts. Now for the lame excuse. . .

I am self employed (self inflicted). January and February were terrible
months for me. I could not give a job away during those months and, to
make matters worse, I think people in general have become more wishy
washy. It just seems so difficult for people to make a decision
anymore!!!

So things finally picked up and I have been scrambling to keep up, keep
my customers happy and to pay down the old bills incurred during the dry
spell. Meaning that I was working right up to the eleventh hour to get
the bus shirts done. And the design came out real nice, too. But, I
pulled a favor and had a freind burn the screen and when I went to try
it, it was just unacceptable. And, I was soooo bummed that I just didnt
wanna go at that point. Later, of course, I regretted pulling a no show.

So there ya have it. Don't know if that is exactly bus content or not.
