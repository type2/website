OK, what we have here is a failure to communicate!  :)

In American, &quot;hardware&quot; is small parts, such as nuts, bolts, pins, hinges,
latches, etc.  Originally, a &quot;hardware store&quot; was simply a place where you
went to get this sort of stuff.

The concept expanded to where &quot;hardware&quot; stores sold other building
materials such as lumber and cement as well as gardening materials and
equipment.

In the last few years, the stores have bloated out to the point where they
sell just about everything associated with a house.  These are called
&quot;home centers&quot; or somesuch.

The bad news is that the megastores only sell the items that move quickly.
If you're looking for a 5mm left hand nylon screw, forget it!  The quality
has also suffered as cheap pushes out good.

For this reason, some of the old-style hardware stores have managed to
hold on.  We have one here (Newhall Hardware) that has been around for 50+
years.  When I need _real_ hardware I go there.  The prices are higher,
but they have everything and it is good quality.
