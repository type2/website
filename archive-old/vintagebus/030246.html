What has changed since the 'good ol days'?  How was the hobby so different?  I'm
sure it isn't just the new beetle... an awful lot of people have hopped on the
internet since about that time... and I bet that helped it along too....  I've
only been into buses for 2 years now...so I really don't know what it was like.
I can remember when I was a kid seeing them... and my mom telling me what Things
were... so I knew about Things before buses...

&gt; &lt;&lt;  As much as some of you may &quot;Dislike&quot;?
&gt;  the NB--It has brought attention to the VW Hobby--Now &quot;Other&quot; people are
&gt; recognizing the
&gt;  Vintage VW that we are driving-- &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thats the bad part, so much has changed since then.
