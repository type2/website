&gt; I'm fixing to install a piece of aluminum deluxe trim on the rear hatch.
&gt; I'm having a problem with it, because I need to drill each hole out for it
&gt; (the gate is not stock deluxe).
&gt; Now for my question.  The holes on the either end of the trim are right on
&gt; the edge...this means that when I drill the holes in the gate for them,
the
&gt; will stick out and hit the seal when the door closes.  I hope that makes
&gt; sense?
&gt; Anyway, if I could get an answer more clear than my question, I would be
&gt; appreciative.

Sounds like you have a section of side trim that someone cut to the width of
the hatch.
I just went out and measured mine. The end screws are exactly 30mm from the
edge. This puts the screw inside the hatch.
