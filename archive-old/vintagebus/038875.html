Have one in all three of mine, never ever had to use one.

Years ago my friend Steve's Baja's engine catches fire, no extinguisher! He
immediately pulls over and screams &quot;its gonna blow&quot; we bail out and take off
running. Only seconds pass and this old lady pulls up in a bay window gets out
gets her extinguisher from behind her seat walks up and puts out our fire...

I always learn best by humiliation.
