Subject: Re: [VB] SO23 purchase update

volks,

&gt; does it have a cold box in the rear drivers side(it
&gt; would have had two ocal shaped doors on the outside)

it does.

&gt;&gt; it still has the original floor
&gt;&gt; covering
&gt;&gt; in the camper section, 
&gt; 
&gt; you mean the sisal carpeting??

yea, the carpeting.  (not sure if it's sisal or not,
but it sure looks correct, has the grommet where the
table leg goes and another grommet towards the pass.
side rear where a little hook-like thing sticks up. 
(there may be more grommets, not sure.  only have
gotten two looks at it so far.)  anyway, i'm pretty
sure it's original.  (sure hope so anyway.)  it looks
pretty cool.

&gt; and also has the original front
&gt; seat covering underneath the recovering.
&gt; 
&gt; red and black checkered cloth??

yup.

&gt; roof rack-&gt; lotsa half decent repros out there- not
&gt; that accurate but passable to the untrained eye (a
&gt; 61 would requitre a sloper rack to be correct)

these are the &quot;two screws in the slats type&quot;?  do they
have square &quot;cross beams&quot;, or are those earlier?  i
think i know what you mean by sloper - they're lower
towards the rear, right?

are the current repops that oldvolks are selling
pretty decent?  (not correct for this i realize...)
 
&gt; 3 shot glasses-&gt; reproed again not that accurate but
&gt; passable

i recall seeing a few around in the last few years. 
usenet, ebay, or somewhere....

any idea on where to track down a set of these glasses
and shot glasses?

&gt; rear webbing-&gt; no idea the net should be reaonably
&gt; easy to fab

i've got a guy w/ an original to pattern it off of, i
agree.  (hell, i never could come up w/ a net for my
'69, so i'm sure a '60 will be a real needle in the
haystack thing....)

&gt; rear curtains-&gt; the curtain rods or the actual
&gt; material?

curtain rods are all there, just missing the original
curtains.  it has curtains though, but i don't like
them.  (it may be missing the curtain rod behind the
bench seat though.)

any thoughts or ideas, as always, would be greatly
appreciated.

thanks, john
