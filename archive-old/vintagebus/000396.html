&lt;&lt; Not even sure if anybody out there knew there was a SOTO show today down
 in the San Diego area, but there was, if you can call it a show.   I
 happened to be down in the area visiting my parents, so I decided to
 drive by.  They might have had something in the swap I needed.
 
 Well, as I drove up at about 11 am, I thought that I must have got the
 dates wrong...where was everyone?  As I got closer, I saw 3 maybe 5
 busses....that was it!!  There was a EZ up set up at the entrance
 waiting for the throngs that never came.  I didn't even bother to
 stop...it was pathetic!  I think this signals the end of them at least
 down here in the South.
 
 Long live OCTO!

     I heard about it but I had a real busy day cleaning out my sock drawer.  
I'll definitely will be at the O.C.T.O. show
