Subject: Re: [VB] Crank case FULL of oil!!! Ooooh No, Ellis????

John,
	You need to replace the float needle valve in the carb.  This is an 
easy repair.  When they fail gas just pumps into the engine.  It can 
happen while driving, which happened to me this past fall, and you will 
stall.  I tapped the top of the carb to remind the needle valve of its 
job and got home fine.  Most often the float needle valve fails to shut 
off the residual fuel pressure remaining in the gas line when you shut 
the engine off.  Gas drips into the intake and into the engine through 
open/loose intake valves.  A remote possibility is a leak in the carb's 
float. Shake it and see if it has gas inside?  If they leak they sink 
the float needle valve will not work well.  Open the tank lid on your 
toilet for a reasonable facsimile of this system.  I wonder if Ronnie 
has a good source of well made float needle valves?  I am not happy with 
some of my carb rebuild kit's float needle valves.
	BTW to the list(s), I've been talking with Jim Ellis on Bus List 
since the old Lentivw days,  probably over 10 years now, George, too.  
Charlie Ford told me great stories about Doc Ric from list's the 
pre-break up, from that long gone era.    Cal Grant gave me confidence 
to jury rig a broken front tranny mount at Burning Man 5 years ago...  
We are not the founders of VW Bus LIst, George may claim this?,  and we 
obviously have no more rights than anyone else.  Still, Jim Ellis is a 
wonderful person to spend time with here, anywhere.  He is a true 
brother!  Gary Gibson
