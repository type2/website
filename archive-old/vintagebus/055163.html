Subject: Re: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

I really dont think that it was a matter of not
&quot;punching the holes&quot;, I would rather think that
Volkswagen didn't see the need to make a new stamping
for the inside metal of the SS, when it would be
covered by a headliner anyways. And sunroof kombis,
who cares what they look like inside, they are for
work.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So what's with the 'closed' skylight sections
&gt; visible
&gt; &gt; on the interior shots?  Is this how they did
&gt; sunroof
&gt; &gt; standard barns from factory?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ????????????

&gt; &gt; p.s. looks very crusty in the roof, where the
&gt; &gt; roof clips onto the body.  This is very very very
&gt; &gt; difficult to repair if the rust has moved through
&gt; &gt; the u section in which the roof sits....
