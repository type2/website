&gt;        Can you belive this guy would rather see a bus in the junkyard, than
&gt;on           the road, jus because it isn't his style?

    I leap in:

    Sure, it's like whether or not you'd like to see a female
    family member dead or working as a prostitute... slammed
    VWs look *horrible*, it's an abomination. My unbiased
    opinion, anyway. Slice up a Vanagon and I won't peep.
    Dig a big pit and drive all the Eurovans you can find into
    it. Just leave ancient aircooleds alone, don't pimp them.
