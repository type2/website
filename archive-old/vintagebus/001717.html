I'm telling all of you, I'm am so thoroughly disgusted with the length of
time it is taking to get a decent set of 15&quot; rims for my bus  I'm seriously
thinking of just crapping out on the whole project.  Here's the B.S. I've
had to put up with so far:

First set of rims were sandblasted and powdercoated.  They turned out to be
4 -14&quot; rims and 1 - 15&quot; rim.  Wonderful - a mismatched pair with broken
clips to boot.  Further inspection revealed that the sandblasting sand
wedged itself in the grooves between the centersection and rim and then got
powdercoated over.  This was in early 1998.

A year later, I decide to get moving on things again.  I finally get a set
of 15&quot; rims.  I remove the clips this time, I finally get them to the
sandblaster dude and here is what I find:

One of the rims looked good, but after blasting, the bead is pitted as hell
and surely won't hold a seal.

The blaster guy missed a bunch of places that I'll have to redo myself.
They also didn't remove the valve out of one tire and I missed a couple of
lead weights (which they didn't bother to remove either.)

So here I am, 6 GDFSOB weeks later and I still don't have a set of rims.  Is
it gonna take me a whole 'nuther year to get my bus into town?  I can't
believe it's this hard.

Money involved so far:

$25 for original sandblasting job
$125 for powdercoating original rims

trade rims for another set - total money involved in swap and tracking down
5th rim comes to almost $100

pay $30 for 2nd sandblasting job.

I'll still have to pay another $125 for the 2nd powdercoat job.

I'm gonna stick it out I guess but it'll probably be Christmas 2005 before I
can even think about tires.  Does _ANYONE_ have a 15&quot; bus rim with no
ovalled holes and a good bead they can sell me for cheap?  I know they are
hard to find but several listees came forward before and I've since lost
their addresses.

Give me some encouragement and find me a 15&quot; bus rim please!
