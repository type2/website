While you're there, check out the cool pix of my '60 panel.  I inadvertently
created an interesting effect with slow film, bright light, bright bus, and a 
dark garage.

&gt; Check this picture I saw on Thoms site.  It is a factory accessory ad for racks.  It shows a very interesting antenna placement on a factory safari equipped bus.  The antenna is mounted above the left rear tail light.  Anyone have this placement?  Would it be correct?  I guess since antennas were usually dealer installed any place would be correct...no?
