&gt; My friend, Casey Missal, is having a problem getting the Bus Depot to be
&gt; responsive about a part he ordered. I was just getting ready to place an
&gt; order for rubber seals from there but am now concerned. What increases my
&gt; concern is that they do not answer my emails. I am interested in knowing
&gt; list members experiences and whether I should place my order.
&gt;
&gt; Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone know if
&gt; there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?


I have forwarded this e-mail to Jerry DeBaun, who handles our e-mail
requests.  You should be hearing from him shortly (maybe as late as Monday
as he doesn't always work weekends). He tells me that he is now responding
to all e-mailed information requests within 1-2 working days.  If for any
reason you find that not to be the case, please feel free to e-mail me at
home, at ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com.  (The normal address for info requests, which
Jerry checks regularly, is sales_at_busdepot_dot_com, or via the inquiry form on
the our website.)  Since Casey Missal's apparant order probably occurred
while I was on vacation, I am not familiar with it offhand, but will check
into it on Monday when I go back to the shop.

Regarding the rear hatch seal, the reason is that it is only available as an
original German part, while the other seals are available in U.S. or
Brazilian made versions.  Unfortunately, I do not know of that situation
changing in the forseeable future.
