Certainly don't mean this to be spam, but have a friend who is a second
generation, his father owned the shop prior to him, going online
shortly.  This person has been assisting just about everyone in this
city with any and all VW related repairs, purchases, parts location,
tricks, tips, etc. for years.

He wants to set up a webpage for assisting those of us who are into 
Volkswagens in a big way, or for the person just getting their first.  
His thoughts are to put up a reference page so anyone who wishes to
repair their VW can get the technical information from the guy who's
done it hundreds of times and can tell them how to go about it in a
simple and safe manner.  He plans on referencing books already in use
with additional information missing, or just assumed to be known by the
reader to make it so much easier for the novice or those in the know.

He believes he will put up a &quot;How to buy, What to look for&quot; page first
followed by maintenance, brakes, tune up, find that part later.

Might also mention he has the outlets to find parts locally and would
also like to set up a parts location service or swap, classified kind of
page in addition.

Anyone have any thoughts on this, would you visit, contact him with your
questions, etc.?

Will be reading your responses, thanks.
