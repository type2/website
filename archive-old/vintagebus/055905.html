Subject: 1600 engine swap

Just looking for some advice, or things to watch out for as I try to =
swap my running 1600dp from my 71 into the '65 so I can try it out, and =
maybe even register it.  I pulled a barely running 1600 dp type3 engine =
out of the 65, and so far the only difference I notice is the clutch =
throw-out.  I suppose I can just pop the one off the 71 and put it in =
the 65 too.  I've the pulled the motor on the 71 many times, but this =
will be my first swap.  The 65 was already converted to 12 volt, so I =
think I'm ok there too.  Also, the 71 motor has the beetle exhaust with =
the two short tailpipes on it.  Any helpful hints, or other things to =
consider would be much appreciated.  Haven't worked on either in a few =
months and I'm trying to clear the cobwebs

thanks
