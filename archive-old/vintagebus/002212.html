I washed things first with a pressure washer and then I'm using a right
angle air grinder and an assortment of 1 inch cupped wire wheels and end
wheel to clean the underside of my 59 double cab...  If there are places of
grease, I use lacquer thinner.  It helps to have it up in the air.  Check
out my site:

... and yes, it is alot of work.  I have about 30 hours on my not counting
any time of removing things there are still another 20-30 hours to prep it
for paint.
