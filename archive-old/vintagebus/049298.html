Not to BYOB or KP, destination was Anderson Valley up by Ukiah &amp; Fort Bragg. My '63 DC ran great, sipping more gas than usual through 1.5mm holes in the baby dells. (how lurid... I could write for HVWs) It's not the Grapevine test, but it powered up Altamont pass at 60+.  Got 22 mpg for the entire 680 miles. Happiness is a well running bus. 
 
Didn't see any splits on the way up. A &quot;co-founder&quot; of the Anderson Valley Brewery has a '67 Westy, the only split spotted there. Saw a white kombi heading north on 101 south Santa Rosa and a dove blue panel stopped at the first gas station on 5 south of 580. It was too late to pull over. Later spotted a dove blue doublecab on a trailer going north at 6 p.m. just north of Santa Nella. JP? Somebody from KP? They saw me by astonished look and waves. 

We'll have to wait for the satellite photos to see the VW sign on the roof and is easier access than AOL. I have an image of my house and my Thing is recognizeable, not to brag. Need to check known bus locations, I smell a new section of the Gallery, Thom. Any GIS people out there?
