Subject: Massive oil leak!!!

I replaced the seals in my doghouse style cooler a few weeks ago. I
immediately noticed the bus started running hot. I took it apart again to
see what the problem was, and discovered I had replaced the 2 seals that go
from the engine case to the cooler block with the wrong seals(too thick). I
have now replaced the seals with the correct ones and the motor leaks ALOT
of oil. Has anyone ever heard of the block between the motor and cooler
warping? The bus did get hot 5 or 6 times! Thanks,
