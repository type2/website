Subject: some of my first crawlings under VW

Back in 1964 I had a 60 panel with a bastard engine. I bought it for $400. A
VW mechanic was too busy to work on my bus so he showed me how to file the
points and save the $50 that the VW dealer would have charged me. The engine
ran fine with that remedy.

I wasn't a car guy like some of my classmates who bought GTO's and
Corvettes. They had fun drag racing up and down Van Nuys Blvd. My bus was
ready to go to Malibu and back on $.50.

Little things like that got me into saving the cash. As a high school
student, I only made a $1.25 per hour at the lumber yard, which was the
minimum wage back then.
