&lt;&lt; This is a '66 hardtop Westy walkthrough, which has a great interior and a 
straight body...although it has green and white house paint which is 
peeling.......does Jasco work?  Or will it kill the layers underneath? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Yup it will!  Plus it is a nasty chemical.  We use 3M &quot;Safest Stripper&quot; with 
no fumes to speak of and it leaves original paint.  Just try small areas for 
longer and longer periods to get the timing right!   Eric&amp;Barb
