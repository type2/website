I don't mean to 'rain on your parade', but the bed material is not available
(as far as I know).  The profile of the corrugation of the bed material is
different from the cargo floor.  It's for this reason that peices of the bed
of wrecked DC's and SC's are somewhat hard to come by and can be a bit pricy.

Sorry to bring bad news,

Jon
ABC
61 DC (with a small rust-through hole in the bed, but a correct piece to fix
with-thanks Kyle)
