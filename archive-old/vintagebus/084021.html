&gt;&gt;  When I hooked that one up and worked the turn signal  switch it just 
acted like a toggle of sorts. If I made a left turn the arrows  on the speedo 
would light up, then go out if I manually put the turn signal  switch to the 
nuetral position and moved it again
to the left turn  position, the same with a right turn.   &lt;&lt;



Hi Seth,
We have had that problem and it turned out one or more of the bulb holders  
were not grounding to the body.  It could also be you need to spray the  
contacts in the signal switch with contact cleaner.
  You should be able to find a three terminal flasher relay in just  about 
any FLAPS.  The terminals might be labled differently.  Are  you using the USA 
version diagram from AUG 62 from Chassi # 971 550?
