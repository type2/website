 Hey all,
         So....whats the story on the crescent moon looking indention that
 can be found on pre'64 rear hatches?  I saw the most beautiful Double Door
 Panel at BBTA last weekend and it had one of these hatches (got to ride in
 the cargo area, too...very scary...no windows...and the driver was
 intoxicated I think).  I had never noticed this before nor read anything on
 them, either.
  &gt;&gt;
these are not on all pre 64 rear hatches.  AAMAF, I think it is a late 62-63
thang, though I have seen some on earlier ones they looked transplanted
