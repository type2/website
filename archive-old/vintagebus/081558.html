Subject: Re: [VB] sun visors

----- Original Message ----- &gt; &gt;   Sounds like you got a set of TMI repops
with the bus. Do they look newish. I quit selling the TMI (bus) visors due
to
&gt; &gt; there inability to stay in place. Hopefully one day they will fix this
problem. A little piece of velcro will help till you find
&gt; &gt; some originals
&gt;
&gt; yup, they look brand new.
&gt;
&gt; (and velcro was my next idea!)
&gt;
&gt; I'll try the spring/glue/screw action first though.
&gt;

Guess I might be lucky, I've never had a problem with the TMI visors. Bugs
or buses that I've run them in.
