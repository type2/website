my 65 walkthrough panel showed up in havasu today, turned out to be a
real sundial
camper, but missing the complete interior only the roof paneling and the
outside tags are left, so HELP i need complete sundial camper interior,
front walkthrough seats, i have
everthing else i need in my 1500 sq. ft wherehouse of vw parts, ever
time i go in there i find another long lost treasure, if you can help
lmk if you atre coming to JEROME  maybe i could pick up the parts i need
from you there, i will be setting up a booth fully stocked with type 2
parts for whoever might need something tune-up brakes etc.
