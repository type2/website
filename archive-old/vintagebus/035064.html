&lt;&lt; Can someone enlighten me on what all connects to the hot side of the coil

 a 73 type 1 DP ghia engine in my deluxe? &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
If it is a Bosch coil it should have the power wire from the ignition switch 
on the coil terminal #15.  Then going from the coil terminal #15 should be 
one wire with two connections to the carb idle shut off solinoid, and the 
electric choke.  The one and only wire to the condensor and points should be 
connected to #1 terminal on the coil. 

The original wires to the coil were shady and I think the hot ones were 
grounding out...could this melt a coil?
Doubtfull that would do that.  Only having the condensor/points wire grounded 
would probably do that.
