Subject: Re: [VB] FS 59 d-cab 64 westie; possibly 64-67 slider

I have a wife like that too.  She says I must sell my
55 single cab and 66 Beetle to compensate for the 56
Packard I just bought.  She even made me put it in
writing.  Those buses sounded really cheap so what you
must do is this:  Convince your wife that you are
buying this DC an an INVESTMENT and that you can flip
it and make some money.  Put a for sale sign on it to
appease her and put in a couple of ads with an
insanely high price.  After it doesnt sell and time
passes the wife will get used to seeing the DC around
and eventually forget that it was for sale.  It will
work, but wives are usually smarter than we give them
credit for and this trick will fly only once so be
sure to only use this technique on a vehicle that you
absolutely &quot;have to have&quot;.  Once you have blown your
nut, its over.

&gt; I just spent yesterday at Ocean Shores. I played in
&gt; the surf with my kayak
&gt; and a kite.
&gt; It was a perfect day for flying, overcast with 8-10
&gt; MPH winds and nice waves
&gt; to launch off of. Anyway on our way home last night
&gt; we were driving through
&gt; Aberdeen and saw a 59 double cab for sale. Quickly
&gt; Karen my wife grabs me
&gt; and states don't you even think about it! you have
&gt; to many already, plus you
&gt; just spent $600.00 on a new kite today. Needless to
&gt; say I was only able to
&gt; drive by it. Karen knows that if I get out and look
&gt; at it then it is all
&gt; over and I would have to drag it home. So in looking
&gt; at it from my double
&gt; cab as we slowly drive by it this is what I can tell
&gt; you about it.
&gt; 
&gt; 59 double cab looks to have a nice nose and rear
&gt; corners some visible rust
&gt; at the bottom behind the cab, no rear bumper (unless
&gt; it is in the bed), no
&gt; tail lights, bug type exhaust, gates, stock height,
&gt; at least the top half of
&gt; the back seat is their though I would assume bottom
&gt; and base is there too.
&gt; $1000.00 OBO
&gt; 
&gt; In the window of the double cab was a group of
&gt; pictures of a 64 pop top
&gt; westy, looked like it was green and had the camp box
&gt; in it. $400.00 OBO
&gt; 
&gt; A block down the road I noticed another split. It
&gt; was sitting on the left
&gt; side of the road with it's wheel and rear window
&gt; marked for it to be towed.
&gt; The interesting thing was that it was a 64-67
&gt; slider. It was red and white
&gt; and looked to be fairly complete.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I do not have phone numbers for any of this
&gt; but I can tell you were
&gt; they were located.
&gt; The 59 DC with the pic of the 64 is located in a
&gt; yard of a white house for
&gt; sale buy owner on Simpson and 28th in Aberdeen
&gt; the slider was located on Simpson and about 30th
&gt; Good luck! let us know if anyone on the list gets
&gt; these.
