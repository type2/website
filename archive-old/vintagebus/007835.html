Your complaint is an all too common one, and I agree completely with your
comments.

A truly competent alignment shop wouldn't let a vehicle go back to the owner
without a test drive by them and/or the owner, and then completing the job,
if necessary, by making things right.

We have a couple of independent shops in our area that fit this category,
plus a major regional tire dealer group [Les Schwab].

I have had a Les Schwab alignment tech. spend a couple of hours on a
vehicle, finally determine that it couldn't be set correctly due to a
chassis/running gear problem, then return the car with no charge.  The job
is written off as &quot;no alignment accomplished&quot;.

I've had buses on the alignment rack at Les Schwab, and have them find a bad
wheel or hub bearing [once even a loose rear drum] during their normal
careful pre-alignment inspection.  The job was then re-scheduled for after
the necessary repairs. No charge, even after an hour+ of setup and thorough
inspection.

The good guys are out there, but can be a bit tough to find.

FWIW.....

What I hate is when an alignment shop (really a tire store or car dealer
who also does alignments) finishes working on my car, charges me $50-$60,
and the car still pulls strongly to one side (the very reason I took it
in).  When I complain, I get the same old be &quot;the car is aligned perfectly,
so it must be a radial tire pull&quot;.  Then they suggest swapping the front
tires side to side.  I'm tired of hearing this BS cop-out excuse for not
figuring out the real reason for the pull.  I don't want to swap my tires
from side to side, and then wait for them to separate.  Aligning to spec
doesn't work for every car.  Cars can be bent slightly, suspension bushings
can be worn unevenly, etc.  It may be necessary to figure out what's really
going on with the suspension/frame/body relationship to figure out how to
modify the alignment settings to compensate and make the car track
straight.  These guys don't want to bother with that process, it might take
brainpower or extra effort.  Oh, no, not that.

I'm just sick and tired of these guys using 'radial tire pull' as an excuse
to take my money, while giving me zero satisfaction.
