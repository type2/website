I have the same sort of setup on my '65 Sundial.  The rear apron has a
cutout on the drivers side where the tailpipe would come out of the muffler.
It sure looks like a factory cutout.  The edge is rolled and everything
looks original, not hacked up.

Right now I'm still using the muffler from my Ghia, I just took one of the
tailpipes off, and the other sticks out through that divot.  BTW, this is a
bad idea.  the apron partially covers one of the muffler outlets,
redirecting exhaust into the engine compartment and potentially into the
heating system.  I'm not driving it again until I get the proper muffler on
there.  

So if anyone else knows anything about this I'd be interested to hear any
theories.  

Thanks,

&gt; In the process of assembling the exhaust I bought and have installed a
&gt; bus muffler, silencer and tailpipe.  All well and good.  The mystery is
&gt; that the silencer and tail pipe run over to the driver's side of the bus
&gt; and then point rearward.  Now, the valance for the '67 has a divot cut
&gt; into it that looks like the silencer for this year of bus originally came
&gt; straight back from the muffler, like a bug peashooter. I am willing to bet
&gt; that the muffler, silencer and tailpipe I bought were really made for a
&gt; '68-71 bus with a T1 engine and not a splittie.
&gt; 
&gt; Now a bug peashooter does not fit in the hole in my muffler for the
&gt; silencer, so if it did look like this, then it was a special peashooter
&gt; for the bus only.  Did this exist? does it? or was the '67 muffler special
&gt; in having a tube off the muffler that fit a bug peashooter? If so, does
&gt; there exist a single outlet (bus) muffler with an outlet that will fit a
&gt; bug peashooter?
