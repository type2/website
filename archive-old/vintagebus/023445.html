Howdy Volks,

I have focused considerable time in the last 12 months on issue of engine
temperatures and highway/freeway cursing in a Split-window vintage VW bus.

I have experimented with two vehicles primarily, one is a 1963 with smaller
reduction boxes and now a 1967 with the larger reduction boxes.  The 1963 is
a Double Cab with associated light weight and the 1967 is a full Westy
package... considerably more weight.

In general, I really don't feel that the list presents LOW TOP SPEED as
_common knowledge_ and several threads come up that relate to the issue --
but we always seem to be avoiding THE CAUSE what is becoming obvious to me.
In many of these cases, we argue about gauges, overheating, and so forth --
yet I feel that we haven't given enough attention to the JUST WHAT IS TOP
SPEED issue?

  === The TOPIC ===

I think when we talk about overheating and so forth, I always get answers
about engine tin, carbs, and so forth... yet no one asks about the obvious:
A type2, particularly with stock transmission gearing, has a relatively low
TOP SPEED.  In simple terms, my 1963 is maxed out at somewhere around 50MPH
and my 1967 somewhere around 58 MPH.  YES, I can push the pedal down and go
faster... but heat climbs like crazy once you go past 3500RPM.

VW doesn't come out and tell us maximum oil temperature or so forth -- there
is really very little written on the topic.  But the Internet has allowed us
all to share, and particular on the type2 (Loaf) list there has been the
_common observation that Oil Temps and temperature in general is tied
heavily to RPM.  Driving at 3000 RPM vs. 3800 RPM has made the difference
between 220 degree and 250 degree oil temps in my two Type2's.  And this is
on LONG 60 minute freeway tests, not just a quick zip around town (it takes
over 20 minutes at freeway cruise before my temp levels off... anything
short of 20 minutes and it isn't fully warmed up).

What is engine redline (max RPM) of a type1 stock 1600cc engine?  That is
part of the topic I wish to get some discussion going on.

VW clearly put shift marks for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years on your speedometer.
I installed a tachometer in my '67 and it is somewhere around 3500 RPM for
all these.  Anyone have the exact number?

Tire size, transmission 4th gear, reduction box size (.25 / .39),
transmission ring&amp;pinion and other factors all weigh in..

Let's start with a simple question.  For a 1967 bus and a 1963 bus... all
stock -- stock engine, stock transaxle, stock tires, stock reduction boxes.
What is MAX RPM on flat level ground?  What is top cruising speed in 4th
gear?  Not HOW FAST WILL THE ENGINE GO, but at what point (MPH and RPM)
should you back off the gas pedal?

Below I have included a copy of a message Mark Chambers wrote back in early
August of this year.  By his own description he is an old timer, yet he
admits that he never realized just how low the gearing is... and often
pushed too far..   I agree with his conclusions, pushing too far doesn't
seem to have obvious IMMEDIATE consequence, but it does likely considerably
shorten engine life.  Although I will say that I don't agree with Mark that
&quot;beyond stock engine&quot; makes any difference.

  === The Obvious ===

I'm sure some readers out there are going &quot;Duh, I've known this for 20
years&quot; -- yet I will take a stand and say that I'm not a newbie at this -- I
have been on the list for two years, I try to pay close attention, I've
discussed the topic at length... yet I feel that a LOT of people are missing
the cause.  If you feel you already know this -- THEN YOU ARE THE PEOPLE
THAT NEED TO BE JOINING THE CONVERSATION.  Explain what you know, what
works, and how we can take our Type2's on long trips and not hurt the engine
(or be forced to drive at 50MPH being passed by everything).

Driving habits have changed.  I see messages every week about people going
on cross country trips in their bus... and we joke about 50MPH &quot;just pass&quot;
but there are a lot of people out there wanting to go 65MPH so they can at
least keep up with the 18 wheel trucks!

Subject: Re: 2 cents worth.... on gauges....


I know this thread was ditched a few days ago, but I would like to put in my
2 cents...

I've been driving VW's daily for 28 years.  I've installed every type of
gauge imaginable in my vehicles.  For the most part, I've found my gauges to
be unreliable, and have also found that the stock idiot lights are probably
99% accurate and predictable, with the exception of the oil pressure sensor
unit, which seems to have a short life, but no problem due to obvious
symptoms when it fails.

There is one gauge, though, that is worth its weight in gold, especially in
gear reducted Type II's running bigger than stock engines.  The tachometer.
For years I considered myself an expert (seat-of-the-pants) at extimating my
revs, cruising the freeway.  After recently hooking up a tach in my 64
Double, I discovered that I have been over-revving by 400-500 rpm at cruise
speed.  This might explain a few thrown rods a few years ago.

Just passing on my thoughts to the list....
