Not &quot;the one with the most money wins&quot;!

&gt;No offense, but I think its a bit naive to think a corporation doesn't 
&gt;consider profit in the grand scheme of things. 

I guess I am naive. What does profit have to do with that statement? I hear
lots of people say the exact same thing about paying people to do it all
the time. In fact, one of the mags had an editorial about it a while back.
As I remember, they defended the fact that the cars in their mags where
like this. So, apparently they're aware of how people feel. If you check
out the vw aircooled newsgroup you'll see even more people all saying the
same thing. They want to see cars that the owners worked on themselves
'cause they love it. Not a list of who they paid to do what.

If your talking money, I think it's fine for them to plug the &quot;W**fgang IRS
lowering kit&quot; or whatever they put on their vehicle. That takes care of
their advertisers. But to say that &quot;Jose at Jr's body and paint sprayed the
metallic pear candy apple puke&quot; does nothing for making the magazine money.

There are plenty of nicely restored REAL vehicles out there that I think
most of us would enjoy hearing about. That's the message the new editor of
VW Trends has overwhelmingly recieved. He claims he's gonna make changes.
We'll see.
