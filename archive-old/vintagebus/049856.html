Subject: Re: [VB] FS: Carb Govenor for early bus....  $3000 ?

&gt;Got one, but not for that much.  I remember someone once ask me for one, and
&gt;I found one in a box tonight.  Took it off a early bus that had sat since
&gt;1971.  Started right up with a little coaxing....  I found a carb plate with
&gt;a vacume line I think may go to it, was in the same box.  Do you know??
&gt;Once someone said they were worth $100....... and once someone told me $20.
&gt;I put $40 on it.  You tell me.  Anyways see the following for a pic.


I saw a NOS one go for $24 on Ebay a while back.  I paid around $15 for a
used one on Ebay.
