Subject: Brake Drums

Hello all...
So, I woke up early today because I thought I had to work early.... 
arrived at work an hour early.  So methinks I'll head back home and pick 
up the brake drums I've been meaning to turn for the last week.  After I 
was done actually working today...I took the drums back on the lathe and 
turned 'em.
These are 64-67 rear brake drums.
After turning them I took measurements with a digital calipers...
What I came up with is:
Brake Drum 1:  Inside Diameter of 10.047&quot;
Brake Drum 2:  Inside Diameter of 9.991&quot;
I had to make a slightly deeper cut on one because it was gouged 
probably due to running with no material on the brake shoes.

Are these within spec and/or safe to use?

Thanks for any input...
