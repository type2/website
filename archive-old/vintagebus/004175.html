&gt;It was great to see all my DBG buddies and I &quot;earned&quot; my official club
title
&gt;of &quot;Inspector 32&quot; by crushing a fold-up lawn chair with my big a$$.

HAHAH!!  You know why I can laugh John?  Because I've done that too!  It's
embarassing but also funny at the same time.  They just don't make lawn
chairs like they used to! :-)

&gt;Laffoon's newly purchased single cab, watching NQ work tirelessly
throughout
&gt;the weekend.

You noticed eh? :-)

&gt;It was a tribute to the DBG that the &quot;clean living&quot; theme was taken to
heart
&gt;by nearly everyone, (who kept leaving their underwear in the shower???)

Yeah who kept leaving their undies in the shower?  I noticed that too.  I
had never heard of the DBG before this.  I had a blast watching the DBG and
Missouri Micro crowd - those are the guys that made the campout fun.  What a
riot!  Talk about laughter at the events Saturday night.  Can I get some
info on joining these guys?  Sounds like a blast...

&gt;The Missouri Micros threw the social event of the season with their post
&gt;award &quot;luau&quot; quite the affair complete with straw hats, grass skirts and
&gt;gallons of jungle juice.

No kidding and for the first time, I got laid!!!  Some guy came around and
asked me if I wanted to get laid and let me pick one of his &quot;lays&quot; out
(those Hawaian things you wear around your neck.)  This was what Bill
referenced at the ceremonies when he said there was a lot of politics going
on and bribery for votes.  He even remarked that he liked it and I did too!

&gt;Thank you Bill and Kathryn, and everyone else who organized and attended


I 2nd that!  This is now on my &quot;don't miss&quot; list of events.

NQ
