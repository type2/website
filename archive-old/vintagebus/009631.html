I'll have to agree with Mr. Yust; front tranny mount.  The added force on
the shift rod coupling can cause the coupling to part also.  I replaced mine
without removing the tranny,  but I had to loosen all the nuts and pry the
tranny rearward to get the new mount installed.  And that's with the engine
out.  It's a good time to take care of all the other stuff while everything
is apart.  Check the archives for different list of things to do, like
starter bushing, axel boots, seals, gas tank sending unit need replaced?
Good luck.

&gt;I have been driving my 66 bus for about 6 weeks now and I have noticed that
my shifting has become much more stiff than it was&lt;
