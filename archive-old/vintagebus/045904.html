&lt;&lt; One more thing to beat the dead horse with is this:  People who list things
as something they are NOT.   I won't name names as they might be reading.
Here is an example.   A part is listed as NOS but in the description the
seller says something like &quot;Ok its really not NOS but this thing is CLEAN
CLEAN CLEAN  I restored it and its just like NOS but better!&quot;

Give me a break!  If the F'ing thing is not NOS don't list it as such.  This
also goes for the people who insert &quot;not NOS&quot; in the title string so people
searching &quot;NOS&quot; hit their auctions.

Buyer beware.
