PS:  There was a guy a few years back advertising in VVWCA newsletter for 
parts he &quot;needed for my daily driver 1962 Blah blah blah&quot;  Two months later 
there would be an ad &quot;For Sale: 1962 Blah blah blah&quot;  This went on and on for 
a couple years with several different cars.  Decided then and there never to 
sell anything to the guy due to his misleading ads.  Without reading the ad 
you won't get the feel for the level of begging and shiesterness but it 
really turned me off that he was begging for parts for his &quot;Daily driver&quot; 
when in fact it was something he was building to sell.  Wouldn't have a 
problem with the ads if he would have just been honest about the intentions.

ya- I dont think there is anything wrong with buying parts to put together a 
62 bus that you are planning to sell.   Then someone can buy a fairly 
complete, functioning bus, who would not have the time  or energy to put t 
together, and hopefully this means a few buses are dragged out of the fields  
or junkyards and saved- put back in use.     I think that is a good thing.   
But why say it is for a daily driver when it is for a fixer upper to sell?
