Subject: Re: [VB] Front end Q's (part deux)

Grease? In the link pins? It looked like arizona dirt was used instead! I adjusted and greased them a few times too, but  wondered why it never made much of a difference. Now I know! 
I ended up leaving one of the link pins in my spindle because I couldn't drive it out and didn't want to totally destroy the spindle in the process. 
Boy am i glad that's done. I now have new spindles, tie rod ends, link pins, and  drag link. It was a pretty painless job actually, but very dirty. The only complaint I have is that the caps that came with the new link pins didn't come close to fitting with out a persuasion.
