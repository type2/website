Subject: Re: [T2] Feel tank w/water to weld?

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;David Brooks&quot;


&gt;  I had to pull the T4 in the split to fix an oil
&gt; leak.  While it's out I'm installing a bay window service hatch.  My gas 
&gt; tank
&gt; (made by PO) is not stock or baywindow.  It's a square off (sort of) tank
&gt; about 20 gallons.  It is a PAIN to take out and get back in.  Feeling it 
&gt; with
&gt; gas to the top is not an option.  Wondering what everyone's opinion was 
&gt; about
&gt; draining and feeling with water, weld (about 1 hrs worth) draining it
&gt; immediately blowing air through it then first tank of gas run water 
&gt; remover?
&gt; My main concern would be rust developing inside the tank in that short 
&gt; time
&gt; but causing a problem down the road.

David,.,, you didn't mention why you need to weld the tank... or where on 
the tank needs welding.
assuming it is the tank your going to weld... then putting water in it makes 
it impossible to get a weld that isn't porous.
I have always used CO2 or argon,, what ever is in my mig welder bottle.. I 
put the hose from the co2 bottle into the tank while welding...   this is 
something I would never recommend to anyone.

Assuming your worried about the tank while you weld in the Bay window engine 
style hatch access door above the engine...  I personally wouldn't worry 
about the gas tank at all.  Make sure the cap is on,, the outlet is plugged 
[as you don't have an engine installed] and any vents are not in the area 
your welding.

Good ventilation will maintain gas vapour away from your welding.
If your using a Mig welder,, you have to be careful you don't ventilate your 
sheilding gas,, so don't point a fan at the place your welding.. or the weld 
will be awful porous.

I have seen many bay window over the engine access hatches installed with no 
welding at all.

You can trim the area so you can &quot;glue&quot; the hatch in with products ranging 
from latex caulking and a few rivets or screws ... to ureathane windsheild 
caulking and no fasteners at all.... to that autobody product [name escapes 
me] that they glue roofs and quarter panels on with... no fasteners ,,

You can rivet or screw it in and cover them with seam sealer....

I plan on putting a much larger hatch in a Bay bus,, and I am going to use 
the &quot;glue&quot; in such a way I won't even have to do any painting when I am 
done... a lot along the lines of installing a sun roof in a car.

When they install the sunroof,, there is no painting,, no welding,, just 
hack the hole to a nice close tolerance.

Hope that helps

Jamie Rivers
