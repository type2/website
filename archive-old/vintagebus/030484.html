How could this be true???  GM, Ford, Chrysler, Porsche, Mercedes, BMW...ALL
these companies support the collector car hobby!  Of course they don't
sanction unlicensed merchandise, but they also don't target the very people
that might buy one of their current products either!  These companies see the
marketing value of the car hobby.  Much like supporting racing (win on Sunday
sell on Monday) by supporting (with parts, engines, and event participation)
the collector car hobby they reinforce brand loyalty and increase their brand
recognition through these efforts.

VW, for some reason is reacting out of fear.
