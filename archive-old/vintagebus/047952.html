&lt;&lt; Well, I tested my compression awhile ago and found:
 #1 - 125 lbs
 #2 - 120 lbs
 #3 - 85 lbs
 #4 - 120 lbs
 
 Uh-oh.  Ran some diesel thru the carb as per Muir, to no avail.  So I guess
 I need a valve job?  I'm a little (OK, a lot) unclear as to what this 
actually
 entails.  Am planning to pull the heads off on Friday, as I understand it 
both
 heads should be done.  Should I just get new ones?  What should I be looking
 for?
 
 To complicate matters, it seems like the bus sometimes regains it's lost 
power
 for little spurts, then goes back to eternal slowness.  Would that be the 
valve
 finding its proper place for a little while, or coming unstuck or something?
 
 
 Any advice welcome, 
 Diana &gt;&gt;

it may be the valves and/or other things.  If you squirt some oil down the 
bad one, and the compression goes up, the rings are bad.   Realistically, the 
least you should expect to do is rebuild heads, replace rings and rod 
bearings.  Are you DP or SP- most DP heads are cracked.   When checking out 
the motor, it may need more.  How is you end play?  PUsh /pull on the crank 
pulley- it should move a hair, no thunk thunk.
