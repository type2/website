&lt;&lt; Now, my sandblaster is a sears siphon-hopper type model, i cant see where
 it would remove that much metal, but being no expert i thought i'd defer
 to the list... &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The ansewer is all of the above including lots of others not mentioned!  The 
blasting is good for irregular areas and the sanding disc is good for large 
panels and will not warp them like sandblasting will do if you use too high 
of pressure and incorrect angle.  Also using phosperic acid works well in 
cool temps and/or when covered with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out 
before it's work is finished.  This is especially great for removing 
windshield frame rust without the messyness of blasting and is quiet if you 
live somewhere where you really are not allowed alot of noise or working on 
your car.  Also good at removing rust in popout frames, safaris and other 
tight places were sandblasting can not get into.  Even at the bodyshop paint 
stores there is an acid wash (Light phosperic solution.) to treat steel after 
rust removal to get rid of the last of the microscopic rust before primering.
