Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals

Does tar effect the paint at all?

&gt; I have a tub of roofing tar, mix it up well with a

&gt; window ledge before 
&gt; installing window.  never bothered with the
&gt; condiment bottle. Once used the 
&gt; squeeze tube you put in a squeeze tube squeeer
&gt; (sorry I can't remember the 
&gt; name, caulk gun, that's it) but it was unusable the
&gt; next time I tried it (the 
&gt; tube, not the caulk gun) so I went back to the tub. 
&gt; 
&gt; clean up inside and out with wd-40 after installing,
&gt; then glass cleaner.  You 
&gt; get an idea of how much to use after you do a
&gt; couple.  You don't need so much 
&gt; that it slops all over the place, it is supposed to
&gt; be between the seal and 
&gt; body, not a very thick space.
&gt; 
&gt; Eric likes to tar the seal before putting the seal
&gt; on the glass, but I use 
&gt; motor oil.  And oil around the entire outside of the
&gt; seal, and where the 
&gt; string goes (makes it much easier to get the string
&gt; in the groove and remove 
&gt; string). Once someone mentioned it isn't the best
&gt; idea to use petroleum 
&gt; lubricants on rubber, but I think he was thinking of
&gt; something else, and the 
&gt; bus hasn't had babies yet.

&gt;  I believe this is the point where I made my life
&gt; difficult.  I believe some
&gt;  clarification on this point discussed in the thread
&gt; last week may in fact be
&gt;  necessary.  As I was putting the gasket on the
&gt; windshield (passenger side) I
&gt;  was using a condiment bottle to squirt in the tar. 
&gt; This made a huge mess
&gt;  that I will be cleaning up for a while.  When I put
&gt; the drivers side gasket
&gt;  on I installed it in the glass and then put the
&gt; bead of roofing tar under
&gt;  the lip.  This was a much cleaner technique, but I
&gt; still dont think this was
&gt;  the way to go; I suspect that the bead of tar
&gt; should go under the point
&gt;  there the lip meets the glass AFTER the windshield
&gt; is back in the bus. &gt;&gt;
