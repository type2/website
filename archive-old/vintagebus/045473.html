On the step Andy you can replace the front step section with a donor peice 
,if you can find one, some make that section but ,i'm not sure of the fit, as 
to the others guys questions on doglegs used are best, use repo's only if you 
have to, lowest heat and as Thom said tack here tack there walk away ,, go 
slow or else ,,as ronnie put it to patience is a must, or love filler ,,your 
call ,,,, Later Kelly
