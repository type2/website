&lt;&lt; Are the helicoils the recommended solution for stripped threads?&gt;&gt;
We really suggest using helicoils only in areas that you practicly never
dissassemble.
&lt;&lt;  Or another method?&gt;&gt;
It sounds like the next step for you is to use solid inserts.  These are best
also in areas that one takes completely apart to do work.

 &lt;&lt;What the heck am I doing wrong?&gt;&gt;
First the pump is a press fit into the engine case and much more pressure
required to get it in there than the small diameter studs can handle before
they pull out the treads in the soft aluminuim/magnesium alloy.
Well first off did you check the outside diameter of the new pump against the
old with machinist calipers?  The new pump could easily be too big and/or
oval!  If it is the right size then you should put the pump body in your
freezer or better yet in a deep freezer since they run colder.  The case to
pump area is a press fit so cooling the pump body will shrink it a bit and
make pressing it in easier.  Then in an hour or two use a short piece of 2&quot; X
4&quot; against the oil pump body and tap on the piece of wood with a light
hammer, and make sure to install the gasket between the case and pump before
installing.  Move the wood piece around between swings of the hammer and try
to work the pump in straight as possible.

&lt;&lt; Does anyone know the correct length studs to use with a high-volume, M6, 40
 hp oil pump?  &gt;&gt;
As long as they are fully threaded into the case, hold the cover plate on the
pump and fully thread into the nuts the length is fine.  If the studs are too
long make sure they do not protude into the engine case where they can make
contact with the cam gear, and at the other end they should not touch the tin
that is just to the front of the lower pulley or they will rub.  Due to many
differant thicknesses of pumps on the market this length differs too much for
us to give you a particular length.  Torque for the studs is less than 20
Lbs. if memory serves right.  Someone out there should have the hand tech
books out there with the torque rating, ours are not at hand right now.
