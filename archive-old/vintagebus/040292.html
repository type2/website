Subject: Loose backing plates on lowered type II

My 66 has a type III rear with a wolfgang swing axle kit (wishing for stock
right now). The brake backing plates (type III) are loose, the bolts don't
seem to tighten them down all the way. Does anyone know what might be the
trouble here? Am I out of hot h20 with just new backing plate bolts from a
type III&gt;?  I bought the bus this way, and assume the stock bus bolts were
used here.
