&gt;i was re wireing my turn signal switch today and noticed i have one wire
&gt;left over, one of the tan ones. where does it go?

As has been mentioned, check the wiring diagrams on vintagebus_dot_com .
On a '67, those two brown/tan wires on the turn signal switch are for
the headlight dimmer relay.  These two wires are connected to one
another when you pull up on the turn signal lever (towards the steering
wheel).  One of them goes to ground at the wiper switch, and the other
goes to the coil of the headlight dimmer relay.

&gt;also, my emergency flashers dont work, but my turn signals do.

First things first: check all the fuses.  If you find a blown one,
replace it.  Sometimes that starts things working, but sometimes it
blows again right away.  If it blows right away, you've usually got
a short to ground in that circuit.

Your '67 would have originally had the &quot;nine prong box&quot; combination
turn signal and hazard flasher.  When these mess up, it's possible to
replace them with a modern flasher such that the turn signals work but
the hazard lights don't.  To find out the story, flip the turn signals
on and follow the clicking noise to the turn signal flasher.  (You may
have to take down the front trim panel, around the headlight bucket,
to see it.)  If it's a silver or brown plastic box about 3&quot; square by 1&quot;
thick, then you have the original 9 prong box.  If it's a round can
about 1&quot; tall and 1&quot; around, plus some disconnected wires, then someone
has replaced the original box with a generic flasher.  For far more than
you ever wanted to know about it, check
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html .

&gt;and my headlights and reverse lights dont work either, does my bus
&gt;have to be on for them to work?

The headlights should work anytime but the reverse lights only work with
the key on.  Again, check the fuses - the four left fuses in the box are
all for the headlights.

The headlights are powered by an unfused wire straight from the the
battery, so if you can start the engine, the headlight switch probably
has power.  Use a test light between ground and the fat red wire at
the headlight switch to know for sure - if you can't get the light to
come on, you've probably got a broken red wire in the harness.  If it
does light, pull the knob all the way out and check the fat white/black
stripe wire for power with a test light.  If no power, then you've got
a bad headlight switch - see
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-hauptlicht-schalter.html for a
possible fix or get another one.  If the white/black stripe wire has
power at the headlight switch, check its other end at the headlight
dimmer relay for power with the headlight switch pulled all the way
out.  If no power, then you've got a broken white/black stripe wire;
if it has power, pull the white/black stripe and yellow wires off of
the headlight relay and touch them together.  (Do NOT let either of
these wires ground out on the body!  This will cause a total harness
meltdown!!)  If this puts your low beams on, then you have a bum
dimmer relay.  If your low beams don't come on, then you have trouble
in the wiring between the dimmer relay and the high beams.  Or maybe
all your bulbs are burnt out...

The reverse lights are powered by a wire coming off of the coil to an
in-line fuseholder on the fan shroud (a black plastic thing about 3/4&quot;
around and 3&quot; long) that will come apart to reveal a normal 8 amp fuse.
The wire then goes to a plunger switch on the nose of the transmission,
then back to the right reverse light and then the left.  If you can
start the engine, the backup lights &quot;should&quot; work.  Check the fuse and
bulbs.  If they are good, pull the two black wires off of the switch
on the nose of the transmission and touch them together - if this makes
your reverse lights come on, you've got a bad switch, but if not, there's
a problem in the wires.

Good luck!
