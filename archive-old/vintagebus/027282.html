Hey folks,

Check this picture I saw on Thoms site.  It is a factory accessory ad for racks.  It shows a very interesting antenna placement on a factory safari equipped bus.  The antenna is mounted above the left rear tail light.  Anyone have this placement?  Would it be correct?  I guess since antennas were usually dealer installed any place would be correct...no?  

Here is the link http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/image/busrack.jpg

If it does not work look under &quot;more bus pics&quot; from his main page.
