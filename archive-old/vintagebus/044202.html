Matthew,
My 66 (with a 71 1600 DP engine and the same dizzy set up you have) used to do exactly the same thing.  When the engine heated up, it wouldn't hold an idle.  Turns out my carb was shot and keept flooding out the engine at idle.  When I tried to adjust the 34-pict 3 carb, none of the adjustments changed the idle speed, so I replaced the carb and have not had a problem since!  Try the carb adjustment first and see what happens?.?

I just got my '62 bus roadworthy again yesterday, in time for the 90+ degree
heet of southern Indiana !   I've had it for about 2 years now and in general 
it's always run very well.   But occasionally it just refuses to idle.   As 
soon as I take my foot of the gas, it stalls.

This morning was a perfect example.   It started up and idled fine.   As I
drove out of town (about 2 miles), it idled fine at both stop signs.   Then
came the 10 mile stretch of 55mph highway.   After that, it died as soon as
I took my foot off the gas.   It proceeded to stall at every stop for the 
next 5 miles of the trip.   But when I pulled into the lot at work, it was
back to idling fine.

Any ideas ?   I *just* did a tune-up (new plugs, new points, set the timing,
adjusted the valves, etc).   

I should mention my '62 has a 1600 DP out of a '73 bug with a Bosch 009 
distributor.

Thanks !

- Matt
