Subject: today..

Hey all,
Thanks for the replies to my bearing problem.  I called up Ronnie and
got things situated and think I'm going to order from him.  Its nice
calling a parts store in another state and the person knows you and
knows your problem before you call because they read your post!  I like
that :)  Thanks Ronnie.

Well...parts will take a day or two to get here...so I thought I'd
tackle another job while I'm waiting.  I pulled out the windshield on
the passengers side (the leaker) and have it all prepped to paint.  I'm
on my way out to pick up some good paint to paint it with.  I'll have
the windshield back in tomorrow.

more tomorrow......maybe even tonight?!
