&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 I want to put a gas gauge in my 59 double cab (don't worry, I'm not going to
 cut the dash) but am curious about the sending unit.  I'm not interested in
 swapping tanks either.
 
 Anybody do this before???
  &gt;&gt;

I think the only difference between a 59 fuel tap tank and a 62-66 gas guage 
tank is the hole for the sender unit.  So, you can cut a hole for the sender 
unit, and install one, or save yourself the hassle and use a tank alredy set 
up for that, and you can install the tap in the same place (figuring you 
still want one)

You could also look for a stylee pre 62 gas gauge.  are you 6V?

Some DPO had done a bunch to the 59 SC I used to have.  It had a 15 gallon 
bay window tank, a guage hole cut in the dash with a VDO non VW faced guage, 
(and extra holes cut here and there in the dash, also a later shift coupler 
installed so there was no reverse till I got rid of it, and a ball joint 
68/69 front beam, and funky taillight, the front turn signals shaved and the 
wires hooked up to the front running lights. poor truck, ended up being 
decent though)
