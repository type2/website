Subject: (VB] Re: Hemp, Hippies blah, blah, blah

&lt;&lt;it seems every day i see acres of trees being leveled so new housing
developments can be created. i guess this cant be avoided, because of
the
rising population and the rising life expectancy. BUT, when acres of
trees
are mowed down to produce paper products, that to me is the problem.&gt;&gt;

Hold on there, Bob. If we legalize hemp and, through the process, cut
our use of trees in half, it will make no difference when, in thirty
years time, the population doubles once again. The same with pollution,
garbage disposal, green house gasses, crime, etc. Make no mistake about
it, population is the problem. The only politician I have ever heard
address this problem, either on a national level or a local level, was
Al Gore. No matter where your feelings are regarding the vote count, you
must at least give him credit for addressing a problem that is so
serious and fraught with political backlash.

I am not saying that hemp should or should not be legalized. My point
is, don't expect it to solve the world's problems. The only thing that
can make a dent in that is proper use of birth control.
