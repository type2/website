Subject: Re: Rear main bearing area issue

&gt;As you can see in the pics the rear main bearing area was a bubble zone
&gt;during the casting process and is the only place I found like that.

My instinct says not to re-use the case.  To maybe lend a little support
to that, do you know why #3 was fried?  Did it lose a valve, or lose
cooling air, or ???  Do you know about how many hours were on the engine
when it blew?  Is it a replacement case or an original (and if so, how
the #$_at_% did it get out of VW looking like that?)  Something else I wonder
about is if there are more bubbles elsewhere in the casting that just
didn't get exposed by the machining.

&gt;The case does not need align bore but I am open to suggestions as to if
&gt;I should use this case or make a nice fire with it?

If you decide to toss the case, you might cut out that main bearing area
as a trophy.  If there's a nearby university with a mechanical engineering
program, the professor that does &quot;properties of materials&quot; might like to
see or have that part.  I know one such prof at the local University and
he is always looking for stuff that is broken in interesting ways.

&gt;HMMMMM... maybe a little bondo or spot putty?......lol

Naah - those are fiberglass or plastic.  You need to fill it in with
real metal, like solder.
