O.K. Volks, 
I'm starting to get nervous, I signed up for the campout on the Olympic
Peninsula at the Lyre River campground and paid my sign up fee.  I haven't
heard much in the last 3 or 4 weeks.  I'm leaving Tues for B.C.  Gonna visit
my grandfather, meet my mum who's gonna take the my boys up to Edmonton
while the S.O. and I go to Seattle and visit her folks for week before the
campout on the Pen. 
  I last counted just shy of 20 Volks signed up on Dan Axelson's page.  So
what's the status?  Where and when shall we meet?  Who's actually planning
on making it?  Don't leave me hanging guys, this will be my first
semi-organized Bus outing.  
looking for some feedback here...
thanks,
Oly Olsen
