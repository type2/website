Subject: Re: [VB] That Darn Vent Glass Seal
To: getsmarx_at_hotmail_dot_com, VintagVW_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I took the rubber seal, wrapped it ALL the way around the glass (yes, ALL 
four sides), STREEEEETCH, then I took a pair of vise grips to hold the rubber 
ends together on the outside.....took hot soapy water, silicone spray, ect 
ect and beat on it with a rubber mallet until it sat properly.
Undid the vise grips and soaked it in hot water letting the rubber pull back 
into the frame.
Let dry.
After a few days i rough cut the rubber, then after a few more I final cut 
the rubber and installed it.
GOOD LUCK!

&lt;&lt; Hey Everybody:

Does anyone have any tips on forcing the vent window glass back into the 
frame with new WCM seals?

I have struggled for 2 days with no luck. I even lubed everything up with 
white grease and still can't get the glass back into the frames.

None of the glass shops in my redneck town will touch a Volkswagen. It is up 
to me to get the things back together.

Thanks,
Skid. &gt;&gt;
