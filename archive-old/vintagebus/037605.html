 Hi Volks,
 Believe that is reffered to by VW as Sea Foam Green.  Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;
it is definately not Velvet Green, as the advertisement said

  I don't see sea foam green listed as a bus paint colour.  I see L380 (42) 
turquoise used on commercial type2s from sept 61 through july 64,

and used on passenger type2s, paired with blue white, from march 61 through 
july 64.  VW called the upholstery colour como green.

...from a splitty parts list updated through 70

also, you could get a bug in L 380 turkois aug 60 through july 63,  and at 
various times these greeny or sea colours were offered: Delta Green (L610) , 
java green (L518), jade green (L349), ceramic Green (L419), Mango Green 
(L346), sargasso Green (L445), Iceland Green (L213), Jungle Green (L315), 
Diamond Green (L412), sea blue (L360), sea sand (L568), Deep Sea green (L66), 
beryl green (L478), Elm Green (L60 D), Peru Green(L60 B), marina blue (L54D), 
sumatra green(L61B), and get this- turquoise metallic (L95B).  Jeez that's a 
lot of colour choices.  (I may have missed some)
