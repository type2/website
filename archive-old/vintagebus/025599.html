Hello Friends,

The other day, as I was pulling out from the parking lot of a
restaraunt, my bus started making a vibration that reminded me of those
little speed bumps they put on the side of the road to wake the truckers
up. Naturally, I was alarmed, but I had to get to work, and as I got
going, the vibration disappeared. I've heard it a couple of times since,
though not quite so severe.

One of the bosses at work told me I needed wheel bearings. I jacked up
the bus at lunch that day and checked both front and back for play. One
of my front wheels had a little bit of play, and I adjusted it out
properly. One of the back wheels, though, had a lot of play, so I
ordered just the two lower reduction box bearings that bear the weight
of the axle.

Incidently, just last week I had to replace a brake cylinder on that
same wheel, and when I broke the axle nut loose, tranny oil started
coming out from the outer lower bearing. I did the brake job (wheel
cylinder, adjust, bleed, etc.) and tightened up the axle nut, hoping
that it would seal itself back up in the process. I haven't noticed any
more oil dripping from that box, though there does seem to be some
seepage.

The bearings are here, and I will probably put them in at lunchtime
Monday, but now I'm starting to wonder if I should have ordered the
upper two bearings also... maybe some seals, too... Any suggestions or
comments?
