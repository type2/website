take...

Thom,

Pulling high g's?  Is that a reference to 9.8 m/s2 or bathing
suit style?  I've heard those &quot;g&quot;-strings can be nasty.  They
would make anyones mirrors wobbly. :)

But seriously, I had the same problem with one set of repops
coming loose at the stem and when I tightened the threaded stud
it cracked the mirror.  On the next set I loosened them up slightly
and put a tiny drop of JB weld in the seam around the stud. 
I carefully tightened it down and it's been holding up fine ever
since.  I am pretty sure there are a couple different repoppers
doing the mirrors, and not all may have the threaded stud.
