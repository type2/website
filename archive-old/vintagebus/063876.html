Subject: Staying Warm - air vent

I pulled apart the air vent in the '63 DC, only two screws required a
vise-grip to remove. The PO had replicated the seals with inner tubes. I had a
26&quot;x1.5&quot; bicycle tube laying around, cut 4 pieces, mitered the corners so they
would overlap and left it doubled up. \====/  Width is perfect. Single
thickness works great for the panel seal. Use grease on the screw threads when
reassembling, they get rusty.

I also used some silicone caulk in the seams of the vent box to keep the water
from dripping into the cab.

One weird thing. The actuator/handle rod has flat spots. Mine are on the
opposite side of the lock screws that look like valve adjusters. Do I have a
RHD control rod?
