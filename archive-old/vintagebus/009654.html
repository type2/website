&gt;Hi Kevin.  The screw should be up on the stairs of the thingy when it's
&gt;cold.  As the dealy on the brown boxlike dweeb warms up, the stairs on
&gt;the thingy trun around until the screw on the whatsit rests on the
&gt;halfmoon object.  The idle should then be at 'normal'.  Open the lid
&gt;when the whole deal's cold, manually blip the thingy a couple times to
&gt;simulate giving it gas before starting.  Start 'er up.  You should have
&gt;a high idle again, that slows as she warms up.

Dave,
I don't know how you did it but I understood exactly what you were talking
about.  My brown boxlike dweeb broke so I wired the stairs back so it was
locked in the 'warmed up, normal position'.  Oh yeh, I also loosened the
screws on the dealy and turned it backward to help hold the stairs back.
