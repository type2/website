&gt;  Check the site under &quot;heating&quot;.
&gt; There are great articles as well as a ton of pictures off almost all the
&gt; models...there are some of the 6v also.   Ron has detailed the restoration
&gt; process with a BN4 as well as its installation.  Read it all, it will help
&gt; immensely.
&gt;
&gt; Oh....when testing keep a fire extinguisher by you at all times ;-)

Oh yeah.  I forgot to mention one thing gas heaters really hate.  The worst thing
you can do is turn them on and then shut them down, only to turn them back on
again before the prescribed waiting time.  The later heaters have a safety feature
that prohibits the heater from dumping gas in a pre heated un ignited combustion
chamber.  The older one don't however and you can cause a nice little fire by
doing so.

Wait for the indicator light to extinguish before turning the heater on again.
I strongly suggest you read all you can before you fire one up or try to fix one.
They are very simple devices...much like anything on a bus however they must be in
good working order to operate safely.  That means new fuel lines, filter, gaskets,
et. all.

They are fun to tinker with though.  Have fun staying warm.
