Subject: The other Everett's travels and travails
To: Bus List &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

The &quot;other&quot; Everett (Reins?) is in the Bus Co-op (my
shop) right now pulling his engine to replace his
clutch.  Fortunately, we met at OCTO, so he wasn't shy
about calling me for help.  Everybody keep your
fingers crossed that that's all that's wrong!

they always break down in Albuquerque?)
