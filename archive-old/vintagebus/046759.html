&lt;&lt; Does anyone out there have a list of serial numbers by year?
 Such as xxxxxx-xxxxxx = 19xx &gt;&gt;

Wish I did!  If you find such a list please let me know!   I can
make 'gross' statements as to roughly what year(s) the trans
was produced by visual clues and the part numbers but nothing
like on the engine cases.
