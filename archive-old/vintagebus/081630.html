Put them on last week and it is like power steering over my old passenger 
car tires!   Never had a problem with the passenger tires but than I am also 
in a SC.  These new Cooper I bought are for my 1960 Westy but been breaking 
them in on the SC.

&gt; Ok enough of this talk about 14&quot; tires -they're easy - what size/brands do
&gt; people run on their 15&quot; buses?
