Tonight I did some more trouble shooting on the 67 bus' electricals.  The
physically hot wire from the light switch was remedied when I pulled all the
wiring off of the rear tail lights.  Must have been a short in one of the
tail lights maybe.  I went ahead and removed the rear tail lights and
reverse lights and had my sister scrub up the reverse light lenses and
seals.  I'm gonna pull the seals and tail lights from the 66 since they are
all cleaned up and install them in the 67 tomorrow.  I next summoned my
sister Kerry again and she ran the brake pedal, turn signals, and light
switch so that I could find out for sure what wires did what.  I noticed
that the voltage for the brake lights was only 9.2 volts so I probably have
dirty contacts up on the MC.  I also observed that the turn signal lights
and hazard lights don't work.  Since I've verified good grounds all the way
around, I'm pretty sure the problem lies in one of 2 places - either the
flasher is bad (new one is on order already) or the turn signal switch is
bad.  I can hear the relay clicking but checking the power output from the
relay reveals little to no juice at all.  Hopefully I'll have this stuff
nailed down tomorrow so I can drive the bus to the gas station to fill up
and then on over to the car wash to blast the engine and rear apron clean.
More later...
