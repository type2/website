When it's good enough for you!  If you're after perfection you must pay
the price of perfection.  If you can live with the ding way down at the
bottom of the rockers then cool.  It's up to you to decide when enough
is enough

Me?  I like Rust-Oleum applied with a cheap brush.  I get to drive more
and I don't have to worry about scratching a trailer whore!
