&lt;&lt; I checked the connections already, and all SEEM well.&gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
Did you clean and make sure the connections are tight?&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; I noticed the cover at the connection of the light switched seemed like it 
had been hot, but I don't know if this happened today or 10 years ago.&gt;&gt;
If you have not taken apart your head light switch and soldered the riveted 
connections do so!

&lt;&lt;If the wire is burned, wouldn't it be likely that I would be able to see it 
on the wire itself?  &gt;&gt;
If you mean by burned that the copper wire is burned through, the wire and 
insulation would be totally burned through.   Eric&amp;Barb
