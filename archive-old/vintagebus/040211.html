Here is a tip...

Save some time by getting a turkey baster (big syringe like tube with
rubbber ball at end) and suck out the old fluid from the reservoir.  If you
are lucky you can suck some of the gunk whole you are at it.

And, oh yeah, don't reuse the turkey baster for Thanksgiving... it's ruin
the meal.....

&gt; got a good one.  Getting ready to do the brakes on the Dor and I was
&gt; wondering what the best way to get all the black gunk outta the brake
&gt; reservoir might be.  The openings are too small to stick my finger in.
&gt; I tried swishing brake fluid around but didn't loosen much at all.  Any
&gt; answers?

You can drain it by bleeding the fluid out thru a cylinder, then use
a rag and blunt screwdriver with alcohol to reach in and swab the stuff
out.  YOu can't use anything but alcohol or brake fluid to clean brake
parts.
