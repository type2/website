Hi Joel,
As the old phrase goes &quot;Insufficient Data&quot;!  What type, size engine, what 
jetting, what air cleaner?   Right now you could have the proper jetting for 
the stocker muffler and have been running too lean up till now or the jetting 
could have been jetted for the extractor muffler and you will now run too 
rich.
Take a nap and then get back to us!   Eric&amp;Barb
