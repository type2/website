Subject: $3 tool

A couple of people expressed interest in the carb jet holding tool I
got today. It is like a slim pen with a plunger on one end. Depress
the plunger and four little hooks extend from the other end. Place the
jet in between them, release the plunger, and the four hooks retract
to hold the jet pretty securely. I've done the same procedure
successfully with tweezers, but they never held the jet squarely and
securely like this gizmo does. It was in a bin at P&amp;M Tools,
Sacramento CA, $3. They didn't have what I went there for, a little
elbow clamp thingy for my new dial gauge. Got a bunch of other junk
though...
