Hi Russell,

Just a thought.  Does your &quot;stock&quot; motor have a &quot;no machine sand seal&quot;
installed?  If so, there is supposed to be a ~3/16&quot; spacer behind the
generator/alternator pulley.  Without it the belt mis-alignment will trash
pulleys and belts.

&gt; This thing eats generator pulleys. Tears them up where the shaft goes

&gt; fans, all to no avail.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I keep the belt tension adjusted as recommended and do not have any extreme
&gt; driving habits. This is a stock 1600DP. Has anyone else encountered this
&gt; problem before? The VW heads that I have talked to are all puzzled by this
&gt; phenomenon. I have used german pulleys, brazilian, and whatever else was
&gt; available - it eats them all equally well.
