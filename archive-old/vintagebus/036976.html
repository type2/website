&lt;&lt; How do you get auto grade paint off of chrome without sanding? My outer 
door handles have really nice chrome but the PO painted over a few parts 
toward the base of the handles.&gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
You might want to try out 3M &quot;Safest stripper&quot; it is the least nasty 
chemically!

 Also, my Panel is a 59' and has the thin metal interior cargo - door handle. 
 Is this supposed to be painted or bare metal? If painted, what color?&gt;&gt;
Pretty sure the panel/truck interior cargo handles are zinc plated or at the 
least just potmetal.

&lt;&lt; Also, does a panel come w/ just one interior cargo door handle. If so, 
what do you other panel owners do when you camp in the back w/ a cab divider 
in if you 
 want the doors closed? &gt;&gt;
The early non walk thru panels seem to have come this way from the factory.  
You can replace your handle with short interior shaft with any from 1955-63 
for a walkthru panel, kombi or deluxe.  Then replace the right forward cargo 
door latch with one from a 1964-67 bus.  This later bus cargo door latch has 
an interior flip-knob locking mechinism which allows one to lock the cargo 
door from the inside!  So you can snugly slumber in security!    Eric&amp;Barb
PS There is a way to lock the stock interior right side forward cargo latch 
on 1955-63 buses.  You have to drill into the into the body of the latch just 
forward of the tongue, and hang a cotter pin by a chain from the interior 
handle.  You just insert the pin into the latch to lock from the interior.  
The problem with this is is it rather hard to do this from the inside in the 
dark.   EEE&amp;B
