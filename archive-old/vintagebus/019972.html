What Thom said, plus a second on the bottom 6-8&quot; on the cargo doors!  For the Easterners, even the
first few inches of the bottom of the cab doors would be really useful.
Doglegs that fit!!!
Cargo floors, NOS style, two halve design. (I THINK I'm right about that!)  Also, seperate cargo
floor entry-ways. (the first 4-6&quot; over, from doors of the cargo floor)
All with a thick enough metal to be able to withstand the hailstorm that Thom recently showed us
pics of!
