Subject: Bug /Engine Transmission in 67 bus
Message-ID: &lt;19990323183727.878.rocketmail_at_web208.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I only found a little in the archives so I figured I
would see if I got any help.  I bought a 67 westfalia
that has an engine and transmission from a 69 bug.  The
van runs strong and shifts well.  I am in the process
of adding the apron and sheet metal that are missing
and all the air hoses etc.  Is there anything I should
be worried about with this setup.  I have a 6Volt 66
that has a stock tranny and 1600 engine in it that I
could use for parts.  I am almost ready to fully part
out the 66 but I will make one more plea to sell as a
whole (see below).

Thanks,

This ia a walkthrough former westfalia.  The interior
is gone along w/the jalousie windows, front seats are
there.  Otherwise the van is complete, engine
transmission etc.  All lights work and wipers,
presently has a rear flat tire.  This is an ideal van
for someone whose van has been smashed, or could be a
daily driver w/out interior.  All doors, one key! The
body is straight, will need rockers and front floor,
side windows and bumpers.  Have spare starter. Will
have to be towed, The engine and tranny are strong! 
$700
