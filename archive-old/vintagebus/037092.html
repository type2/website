Hey guys,

Well, I've finally drug myself out of the beautiful Republic of Texas and 
have moved to So-Cal.  Temecula/Murrieta area to be exact.  Although still 
busless,  I'd love to meet area listees and make some new friends...any club 
recommendations would be great too. I lived in Vegas a year ago so I'm 
familiar with the big uns like OCTO and whatnot...but I'd like to find a nice 
family oriented club that likes to camp and whatnot.  

Since I'm busless too...anyone know of any good pre 62 projects lying about?  
preferably anything but a deluxe.

Oh yeah...if anyone is interested, I've got two bus and bug toy sets from 
wal-mart up for grabs...original price plus shipping

Thanks guys,
See y'all in Havasu...BBB!
Hey Ronnie and John...got a bus i can borrow?
