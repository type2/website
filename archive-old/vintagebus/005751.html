Well I see I am in the minority on this one.  But..... Doesn't Vintage mean
25 + years?  Well that includes most bays now, whether you like it or not.
We are all bus brothers and sisters, people with splits are not any better
than people that drive bays.  We are all a dieing breed.  They don't make
any more of either, so when there are no more splits, more and more of you
will have to start driving bays if you still want to drive an air-cooled
bus.  (not to mention the first couple Vanagons)

I say add the baywindow info because eventually the vast majority will need
it.

And yes I go (drive) both ways....  65 21 window, and 73 Weekender and I
enjoy both.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,

Open to all buses/vans air and water cooled.

If you are going to walk on thin ice,
You may as well dance.
