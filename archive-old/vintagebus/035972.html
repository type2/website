This was a factory option to have a heated rear window.  THink in 67.  Buses 
that came with had a warning light on the dash (hole drill) to remind you it 
is on- same as an italian spec brake warning light- small light.   If you do 
hook it p, a warning light is a good idea.   The bay windows have the light 
in the switch go on, my 69 bug has an extra light in the speedo go on.. (but 
the rear window does not defog)   Oh- but your 66 hazard switch has a light i 
it so there you are.

&gt; Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
&gt; along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to. This
&gt; is for a 58 Deluxe. Is it for a heated rear window? It is a factory wire
&gt; and I have seen them on other buses but was just curious cause I've
&gt; never seen it hooked up. Also there is no mount for an extra dome light
&gt; so I figured it wasn't for that.
&gt; Thanks
wow! that just gave me a great idea. in theory, you could take a heated rear
window out of a baywindow to replace the 63-67 rear window, couldn't you? i
could even use my havard switch that doesn't work. and it wouldn't even be a
hack job!

just a random thought that i thought i'd share.
