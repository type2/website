I know I've seen owner's manual on eBay just yesterday. Might still be up
there but as far as parts, well these things when for sale tend to get very
pricey. Someone had one on CD-ROM and was even willing to copy. Where is it
then??

Later,

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I'm a long time ACVW owner but am about to be first time proud owner of a
67
&gt; westy.
&gt; I'm new to the list so feel free to correct me on etiquette or send me to
&gt; the archives.
&gt; Anyone know of a source for a parts manual?  I know where to find the
Bently
&gt; Workshop Manual, but I am looking for a comprehensive parts manual.
&gt; (owner's manual would be nice too)
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
