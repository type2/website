Subject: Re: [VB] Non-Stock Muffler and Engine Temp

A header and QP will give you about 3-4 more HP, but
I'm not sure it would make a noticeable difference,
unless it was ceramic coated. 
 A 1.5 qt sump doesn't really do much for cooling;
it's real purpose is to add more oil. A sender in the
sump doesn't really provide an accurate reading of
temp, because of it's location. I would suggest
reading the Berg book about cooling, It has some good
info. If you are concerned about operating temps than
I hope that you run a doghouse in your bus (with the
thermostat!), all of your tin is present and check
your rubber grommet's too. They make a difference.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to determine if there's some relation
&gt; between an engine that
&gt; breathes better and a lower overall operating
&gt; temperature.  My camper is
&gt; my daily driver and I'm looking into making some
&gt; small mods this summer
&gt; that should help it run within spec on those hot
&gt; days.	Would running a
&gt; nice S&amp;S header and single QP help keep the temps
&gt; down?
&gt; 
&gt; My other plans include an oil temp guage and tach. 
&gt; Does anyone know of an
&gt; oil temp sender that doesn't fit into the sump
&gt; plate?  It just seems so
&gt; exposed there.	And would a 1.5Qt sump make a big
&gt; difference on a stock
&gt; 1600?
