Subject:  Fitting bay fuel tank...guage..tranny questions
Date: Mon, 4 Sep 2000 11:04:16 +1100 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings All,

Pulled the engine and tranny out of the 23 project and
cleaned up underneath......a little wirebrushing and 
I'll finish painting underneath and paint the engine bay.

Considering many things at this point and I have a coupla
questions....

(1) Of those who have fitted later bay tanks has anyone
used the bay sender and a gauge (what gauge suits?) to 
get a working fuel gauge with this setup?  (no I'm
not going to hack the dash for the gauge....8-))).  

(2) The bus has a small nut tranny and 36hp motor
and the plan is to have a 'driver' config and an 'original'
config for special occasions.  

I could fit a big nut tranny and a 1600-1776 single port
for the driver config but that a lot more work then to go back to
the 'original' config (not as easy as an engine swap). 

Will a later 3.88 bug R&amp;P go in the  tranny reasonably 
painlessly and work with the existing ratios to be nicely driveable 
with a sought top speed of 60 mph with the early reduction boxes? 
....opinions sought........
