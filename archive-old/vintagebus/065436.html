Subject: high pressure/Oil filter/cold issues

One morning last week I was driving along, and about 3/4 of a mile from my house I smelt something funny, could that be burning oil?  Then the oil light comes on, and I see the guage dropping to zero.  I shut off the motor and pull over to the verge.  ^#%&amp;^*#! Grab the church key and a rag and head towards the back. Oil is coming out!  from around the oil cooler.  hm, unscrew filter all the way (there is already a puddle of oil, WTF)seal didn't blow out, quickly screw it back on, tighter, and add a quart of oil to bring it up to level.  Carry on, seemed okay.  Guess the filter worked loose?   Had last changed it at the end of July, using 30 sae Castrol. 2000 miles ago. On these cold mornings the pressure is pretty high- like pegs the 70-psi guage above idle.

Wed night it got down into the teens, and I bundled up to leave Thurs morning.  Pump gas, turn key.  Bus protests the cold slightly and chokes to life, a little less than enthusiastically.  I goose the gas a tad, then hear a funny noise, see the pressure guage dropping, turn the key off, run to the back, see oil coming out, grab a oil drain pan, put it under bus, toss some kitty litter on the oil puddle.  Good morning!.  I get the 61 out of the garage and drive it away.  The 61 has no stupid oil filter.   61 gets warmed up while I get all the crap off the roof rack.  Why do roof rack end up as stuff racks, it's not been that long since I drove th 61.  
  So I decide that 30 wt is too thick with this high pressure filter pump (filter screws directly onto pump- no hoses needed), and got some 10-30 wt on the way home.   Drain th rest of th oil out of 65 westy (have to remove stupid oil drain plug temp sender), and chop wood while the oil drips.  When taking old filter off I notice that it wasn't threaded on straight,  like the filter got BENT by oil pressure.  Had been using a filter with the relief spring in it.  So WTF.

put on new filter, insert drain plug, fill with  10-30. Oil pressure was slightly lower than it had been.   Might blow filter again, hope not. 
If you have too high oil pressure the engine doesn't get lubed huh?  how high is too high?
