I also placed an order on Ron's triple discount day. The order arrived 
promptly. I was missing three seals and immediately e-mailed Ron. This was 
on the 16th. I received a call from Dan the next day to check up on the 
order and to see how I was doing. Well, I received the seals that I was 
missing, today. No complaints just praises of The Bus Depot. Thanks again 
Ron and crew for your service and the gracious offer that


Joy thru Air,
