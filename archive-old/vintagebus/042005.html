Rick,

I am not up on the value of splits, alas.   My knowledge more in the bay
window years.  As a result I am forwarding your mail to the split
windshield list and hope that you will get some responses from them.

&gt; I recently acquired a 66 split window bus.   I am trying  to determine its 
&gt; actual worth back in the real world.   The values over here have gone up and 
&gt; the cars are fast diminishing.   The vehicle has a sliding door and was 
&gt; curious if you know of existence of these in the states because either I've 
&gt; owned to many older splits or this is an option that flopped.  I know your 
&gt; busy but I eat '''' and sleep vdub I want to make sure this ones worth saving 
&gt; from the wrath or letting it go quickly and starting another project.
&gt; Peace Out
