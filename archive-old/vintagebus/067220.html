Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

I never had a problem with passing my stock 1600's in
CA back when I had to. Just make sure it had been
running for a while and I set, if I remember
correctly,  the valves at .08 and the timing at .018.
They always passed. If you have a non-stoker, it's
time to get a back up! I had a friend who did that
because no one would pass a 2275cc with 48's and a 1
3/4 exhaust!
