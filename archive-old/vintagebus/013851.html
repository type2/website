&gt;&gt; I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966 production, 874th '67
&gt;&gt; off the line).  My production plate reads:

Do you have back up lights and duel circut brakes on the Dor?  There seems
to have been some question about early 67s having these features and this is
prolly one of the earliest on the list so let us know please.

Chris
