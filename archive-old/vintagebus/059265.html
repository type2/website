Subject: Re: [VB] Crew Cab Body Panels



Jeremy,

Yes, it is something you can do, and you can do it well. I did a complete
both-sides rocker panel replacement back in the 70's using my housemate's
welding gear, having never seen a welder before. I learned how to weld
using a welding guide book with pictures, and one or two show-me's by the
housemate. I used common sense, and replaced the rusted out areas with
similar good sections taken from a junked bus froma salvade yard. Measured
everything, and took my time, and it worked. Still works. I used a
metal-grinding wheel on the drill to fine-tune the edges before welding
them up. Did the body work as well. The pieces I fit in included wheelwell
to wheelwell, plus one foot up and one foot into the cargo area. I cut
thru frame members, flooring, and body. Welded it all back up with the
'new' donor pieces. Took three weeks everyday. Cost back then, about $300.

You can do it if you use common sense and care.

&gt; Hello Guys/Gals,
&gt; This is my second post here...first one was invisible :)
&gt; I have a '67 crew cab that needs COMPLETE rocker panel replacement.  I am
&gt; about to acquire a welder, is this something that I can accomplish? Or does
&gt; this job need to be left to the proffesionals (sp)?
&gt; By the way- I'm selling my '57 oval for &quot;investment capital&quot; on the crew
&gt; cab.  I tried thesamba- no luck- any other ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thx.
&gt; Jeremy
