I agree about this w/ respect to a house by Frank Lloyd Wright, but, as much 
as we care for them, I can't see busses in the same category.  FLW built 
one-off homes, to suit the site and the owners, but our favorite vehicles 
were produced on an assembly line, where the designer had no idea who, 
specifically, would be buying his creation.  They only wanted to sell the 
maximum number of busses.

PS  This doesn't mean that I'm going to paint over the graphics (some of the 
responses didn't want to qualify it as art) on my Grateful Dead bus= = = = = 
..........= = = = = = = = 
ya- I know the buses were sold as cheap transpo, VW never expected such a 
cult following,   they were not fancy custom orders (well you could do custom 
 orders), yet I still get a sense of that.     I think a large part of their 
appeal is the production was for the average Joe (or Hans).  Haven't seen 
your grateful dead bus,   hope to get my new motherboard soon so I will be 
back to seeing colour again (its on order), I'll take a look then.   :)  I 
don't think that painting it outrageously comes under the same category as 
total destruction, though.   How many times have you heard &quot;save it, dont 
crush it!!!   dont let that &lt;insert bus or bus part here &gt;&lt;such as truck bed&gt; 
 go to the crushers!!!&quot;   And how come it was okay for Herr Hausmann the 
butcher (sausage maker?) to paint &quot;Hausmann's Meats&quot; in large letters on all 
sides of his 4 VW delivery vans (2 58s and 2 63s , the 63 I had was a ruby 
red DD, the  current owner had found Mr H, who said he had the 3 others as 
well), but dubious for  some deadheads to decorate their bus?
