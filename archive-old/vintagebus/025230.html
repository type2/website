this same discussion was had at rec.autos.makers.aircooled.vw (RAMVA) a
couple of weeks ago.

the general consencus came to that fact that you would need around 50-60
amps to run fans adiquate enough to provide proper cooling.  that much
load on the alternator would cause more drag than a doghouse cooling
system (about 10-12 horsepower loss)

&gt; A friend of mine and I were talking about how we wanted to build a fast VW,
&gt; and thought of something. Is it possible to unhook the fan and
&gt; alternator/generator and run an electric fan? This is for entertainment
&gt; purposes only, :) Don't like the idea of race car engines and 5,000 mile
&gt; rebuilds. But just wondering if its the VW cooling system that works only or
&gt; if you could add a totally different one. Thanks.
