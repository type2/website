Subject: busses &amp; balloons report (better than vegas!)

it was really great despite the fact that it rained all of saturday night - something that's never happened in the memory of the new mexicans i'd talked to.  some folks wimped out and went home (you know who you are!) but most of us were up to it, hanging' at the campfires and swapping tall tales and bustin' one another's chops.  at future campouts with jp, don't leave hotel soap in his bus because it just gets in his way and prevents him from stretching out comfortably.  man, i'm still laughing about that!

the balloons were neat too.  i've never been to a balloon fiesta so i got up way early in the morning and watched for the &quot;dawn patrol.&quot;  about 10 or 12 balloons rose up to different heights to test the winds.  in the pre-dawn light, they looked like light bulbs flashing on and off.  i guess they were talking to one another because they'd flash just like christmas lights or all light up together.  unfortunately the winds were treacherous enough so that the fiesta officials were leaving the flying to the experienced.  still there were hundreds of balloons that took off.  my favorite was the one that looked like a grinning demon with wings on its head.

list folks p&amp;c (phillip &amp; catherine) from hespiria, ca and steve white from saint louis, mo were in attendance.  steve almost beat me out for the long distance award by just 30 miles.  the miles were figured using an atlas and i actually drove the long way via phoenix and jerome to albuquerque.

richard and dawn (the newlyweds) came towing dawn's new 21 window sunroof.  they won three awards including the &quot;most lived in&quot; award and that was prolly because of the claw footed tub(!) in the rustybus.  richard said that steve white's '61 looked just like the rustybus when richard first bought it.

jp was very pleased with the large numbers of vw fans that turned out for the event and the over $500 went to charity.  the group was also on the local tv channel twice!  once when doing the weather and once in interview form in association with the balloon festival.  the segments were really great and quite humorous.

for those that worry (you know who you are too!) i'm driving my now starting and stopping (thanks jp!) single cab back toward california tomorrow.  i'll be stopping in lake havasu city for the night and then pushing on to monterey.
