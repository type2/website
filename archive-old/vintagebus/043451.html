&gt;Two things of note: they were turning out nearly 4000 busses a week in 65,
&gt;and that it took LONGER to make the pickup (even allowing May 7 and 8 being
&gt;a weekend).

Actually, the weekend was May 8 and 9:

Also, assuming that the VIN number was assigned on the build start day,
the Kombi started one week before yours.  If the Kombi's plate was
stamped first thing in the morning and yours was the last one before
quitting time, we have (8182-3678)*(5/6) or 3753/week, and if it's the
other way around, just (8182-3678) or 4504/week.  In all of 1965 they
made 176762 Buses in Germany, which is an average of 3399 a week.
Even allowing a couple of weeks for the model year changeover and
holidays, you have to assume that they only worked for 39 weeks and
2 days in '65 to average 4504/week.  To average 3753/week they'd
have to work for 47 weeks and a day, which sounds closer to correct
to me.

Therefore, the idea that Hans was daydreaming of a Warsteiner and
was tired of stamping plates seems pretty accurate.  :)
