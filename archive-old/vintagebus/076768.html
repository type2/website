Subject: Re: [VB] wiper maintenance

Hi Jason,
Good to hear that the white lithium is working for you.  Do you notice any 
speeding up of the wipers as the motor first warms up the grease in the gear box 
or does it stay a good fast motor speed from the get go?  We were worried 
that the white litium would be too thin and leak too easily past the shaft seals. 
 Thusly gunking up the motor armature.  For us with the heavier lithium 
grease there is a bit of slowness at first which speeds up as the motor warms up 
the gear box in outside temps of 20-40ish F.  Definitely made the wipers whisper 
quite instead of the you had to holler loud so you could be heard over it, 
due to the OG stock grease that had gone sooo bad it was like puddy!
