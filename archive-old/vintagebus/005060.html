Subject: 30 Pict-2 Question
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2000 18:41:48 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Can anyone on the list can tell me whether all 30 Pict-2 carbs (as fitted to
my 1500 SP) should have an idle cut-off valve? (mine doesn't).  If so, could
this explain (at least partly!) my buses reluctance to idle? (have checked
for air leaks, set valves, timing, etc).

At the moment there is a pilot jet in the hole where the idle cut-off valve
would go.  It may be that this is correct for some 30 Pict-2's, and I should
just leave it alone and try something else(!), but I would be grateful if
anyone on the list can offer any insight.

I have a cut-off valve from a 30 Pict-1 which I could try, but suspect it to
be 6v in which case would it not burn-out if I tried it?

An exploded view of a 30 Pict-2 in St. Muir (p. 30) definitely shows the
valve, which further leads me to think that mine should have one.  Have also
checked the www.kymcovw_dot_com website (sourced from the archives), and one of
their exploded diagrams of a 30 Pict-2 also has it there.

Any info gratefully received.
