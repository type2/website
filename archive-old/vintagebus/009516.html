Subject: Rear Seat Value?
Date: Mon, 23 Oct 2000 22:15:17 -0400

Hi List, Does anyone know what a rear seat goes for these days? I have an
extra, and someone interested, but I'm not sure how much to ask. I also have
the kick panel, nice alum. strip, but someone spray painted the vinyl. The
seat came from a 65' Standard, and has tears
        I'd also like to thank those who replied to my DD questions!!!
TIA
Michael
PS- I just finished a new webpage yesterday. I plan to add my lit.
collection and more over the next little while. Let me know what you think!
