Subject: Re: [VB] 1600 sp into 65 bus

Ya,  those are bay window parts.  But you can swap the tin  (splitty uses 
same as bug and the heater boxes (splitty uses same as bug) easily with the 
engine out.

&lt;&lt; A couple of issues I encountered putting a '70 single port into a 65 bus:
 
 - front tin is wrong; I need doghouse tin from a Beetle, I guess.
 - heat exchanger flap connections are high and outside rather than low and 
inside, and I see no easy way to make them work.
 
 Just a passing observation.
