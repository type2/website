Subject: RE: [VB] RE:RE: [VB] Re: pictures of vw's

&gt;And if you look *very* carefully, the guy standing in front of the bus
is patiently waiting for AAA to show up and haul his rattle can painted
heap to the house so he can work on fixing the latest break down in time
to make it back to school/work the following Monday AM. He will fight off=

the ex-wife and estranged kids and blow off studying in order to make it
in time. The guy in the Passat and gal in the NB will have plenty of time=

to study and steal the dude's potential future job.
&gt;
This is BYU, you are *very* confused.

Actually the Passat and NB will be in the shop on numerous factory recall=
s
soon, most of which involve fuel problems that could lead to death in a
minor fender bender.  Judging by the prevelence of VW dealership service
complaints on the in-ter-net, they will probably miss the rest of the sem=
ester.
