Subject: Re: [T2] ramp idea

&gt; I saw a display ramp at a used car lot. You drive the car up a ramp then
&gt; it levels out for display.  Anyone
&gt; know where to get one?

I have seen a car trailer that does this... so it is sort of double duty... as a
trailer and a ramp usually for working under .. but could display the car

Basically ,, think of a regular car trailer,, usually tandem axle,,, and at the
four corners, they weld a pocket that accepts a post,, a lot like a reciever
hitch.

You install the post  thru the pocket,, add a foot.. then use your jack all to
lift it,, then install a pin,, do the other corners until your as high as you
want to go....

As has said before,, it isn't suited for all work ,, but neither is a center
post hoist..   If I find one,, I'll send pictures.
oh,, they probably are pricey also!
