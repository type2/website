Subject: inside door handels

can anyone please let me know what year they changed the inside front
door handles from
the chrome grooved  type to the white Bakelite type ????
the bus is a panel and seems to be late 50's, I have only a description
over the phone that was second hand anyway...
It has typical cardboard interior, non safari, non walkthru, RHD ,
semaphores (european model) Any answers would be appreciated, also cost
of bus $$$$????? (complete except no motor) that you would expect to
pay?
The bus is at a car wreckers and i would love save, if the price is
right.
Thanks
