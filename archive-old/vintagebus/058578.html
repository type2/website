Subject: Re: [VB] 2-stage Two-tone?

John,

How big a problem is color uniformity from day to day....mix to mix.  Will
problems arise when you reassemble and have minor color differences from
the doors to the body??

Gun sugestions for the hobbyist?

Steve

&gt; 
&gt; List,
&gt;        One small tid bit I can offer, you can spray both base coats like 
&gt; mentioned and then clear the entire bus, but, I prefer not to spray that
much 
&gt; of an area all at once, you have a much larger chance if missing a spot, 
&gt; messing somthing up while taping, untaping, getting some dry spray etc.
You 
&gt; almost definately will get over spray in some area's, which will lead to 
&gt; extra sanding and buffing. You also spend too much time in the booth,
which 
&gt; will add trash to your booth, and trash to your paint job.  I NEVER spray
an 
&gt; entire vehicle all at one.  I also never spray the doors or hoods etc on
the 
&gt; car, it's simply too hard to get 100% coverage doing things that way.  if
you 
&gt; want your door jambs to look like the rest of the car, or the bottoms of
your 
&gt; doors to look like the rest of the car, paint it in small steps.  You
don't 
&gt; want to be opening doors or deck lids etc while painting.  And tape lines

&gt; suck, so try and avoid them.  Don't take on so much of the car at one
time, 
&gt; and I will assure you the results will be way better.  Leave the
complete's 
&gt; in one day to the collision shops.  Take your time on your pride and
joys.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck painting.
