Subject: re: Muffler belt

&lt;snip&gt;

Why I was unaware that the muffler belt was that important.  For years
now I have been removing it along with the thermostat and all the ugly
tinware Vdoubledoo sticks on their engines.  I once had a large pile of
all that tinware stuff but the metal recycler gave me 5 whole american
dollars for 10 buloads of the stuff.  My bus can achieve the blinding
speed of almost 40 mph and does so in only 15 seconds.  Did I mention
that I get almost 8 MPG?

The muffler belt seems only important if you object to the sound of an
open exhaust from a finely tuned piece of engineering so unlike my bus.
