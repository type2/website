Hey All,

Did anybody see the story of the beetle on speedvision last nite?  No buses 
till the end of the show but pretty interestion regardless of some british 
cat who was pretty hard to understand that got most of the spotlight.  
Hopefully next week they'll air the story of the bulli or something.
