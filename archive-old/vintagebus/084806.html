&gt;The one millionth beetle was produced on this date. 50 Years ago today.
&gt;So was Rusty VanBondo!

Yeah, but did they make a sign and a speech and put flowers on you?
Were there hundreds of people standing around the end of the production
line?

&gt;I want to find my wife a deluxe or other suitable 'girl' bus (read
&gt;non-panel) that was built on her birthday, Nov. 19, 1957.
&gt;Generous finders fee paid to anyone with some leads.

If anyone needs me, I'll be in the garage, looking for that set of
number stamps...
