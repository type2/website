Subject: Need to hitch a ride to Pomona from Arizona
Message-Id: &lt;199904220520594_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

Anyone need a stowaway for the trip to Pomona from AZ this weekend?  I  spent all my money on gas for a gas guzzling 36 horse powered 57 on the way to Kelly park but will be willing to help out on gas money.  I have never been to Pomona before and I need to pick up some stuff I bought at Kelly Park and couldn't fly home on the plane with me.  Anyone in Phoenix (or Havasu for that matter) interested?  Everett? Ronnie?  John H?  Anyone?

Thanks,
Richard
