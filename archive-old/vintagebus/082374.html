Subject: Best line of the lot...

Hi All,

You guys have provided a great deal to think about, but the laugh-out-loud, best line of all was:

Second, you're driving a VW bus....News Flash...everybody IS making fun of 
you already...

I will incorporate all of your suggestions, but I'm starting with some metal work so the driver door works properly.  I do plan to pull the engine and clean up the toxic spill in there, followed by replacement of the battery pan.  I'm happy to hear that I will have access to the fuel sender at that point.  I promise to lose the oil cooler, I would not have thought that it was maintaining heat in the engine compartment, but it makes sense.

Unfortunately, I don't think there are any VW swaps in Northern California coming up.  I may have to make a run to Pomona if one is scheduled.  Then there's the Porsche VW literature meet in Anahiem in January.

Thanks for all the support and conversation,

Clark
