&gt;  Good evening all. I just got back from rummaging through a friend of mines
&gt;  back yard and happened upon a complete set of doors for an early bus in 
like
&gt;  mint condition. Both front doors, cargo doors, rear hatch and deck lid. Is
&gt;  there any way to determine the year of these? They had like pull-type
&gt;  handles if that helps and it wasn't  a barn door. Does anyone know the 
value
&gt;  of aforementioned doors? Does anyone need these? Thanks again!
&gt;  
All the doors are off one bus?

Are the cargo doors high hinge or low hinge (low hinge the upper hinge is 
just above the belt line)  they went to low hinge in Oct 60 I think

same time they changed the cab door handle indent- the actual base of the 
pull handle is sunk into the door, formerly was flat where the base goes to 
door.

Back hatch wide or narrow?   if small, what size window

what colour?

engine lid have bump above liscence plate?  ANy scripts on the lid?

what are they worth?  to me it depends if They are good for a bus of mine, 
and where they are.  I still want a perfect drivers door for my 61, 
preferably in SWR.
