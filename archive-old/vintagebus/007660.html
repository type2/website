Thanks for the replies. I can figure out where/how to mount a compressor,
radiator etc. I am not sure where/how to install a heat exchanger, ducting
and all  the interior stuff so that I have cool air blowing around inside.
Any thoughts as to where to put the interior items? I am not too good at the
aesthetic stuff. I have a kombi with the 1/3-2/3 seating up front. I would
like to have cooling both in the cab and in the back.

Thanks,
Chris
