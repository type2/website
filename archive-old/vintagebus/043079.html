I think a lot of what has been said on this subject is simply lip
service tossed out from simple emotion.
Obviously the subject matter can be far reaching and as little as one item
to many many items can and is affecting each and every one of us...
Things happen so fast when something goes wrong...if luck is with you and
you survive with few serious problems...good!  But should go wrong and
people get seriously hurt and the bottom line for it happening is due to a
lack of maintenance that was known about...not good.
Do what you know you have to do and do it well.  
later
