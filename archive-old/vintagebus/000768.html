Subject: [VB] generator light on solved!
Message-ID: &lt;0.e81e13d4.259c16cd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi:
   Thanks to all who help to solve my generator problem.  After checking 
everything I simply replaced the brush and it works just fine now.  I have 
another question about this.  Is temporary(5-10 minutes) overheating harmful 
to the engine?  I didn't notice my generator pulley was broken till I smelled 
something bad and smoke came out from the engine compartment.  Everything 
works fine now but I really want to know if there is anything I should check 
to make sure my engine is still good.  Thanks.
Michael
