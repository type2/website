When they were doing the &quot;asbestos abatement&quot; thing at my college,
they had signs up on all the temporary plastic-sheet barriers saying
&quot;unless your job requires it, breathing asbestos dust can be
hazardous&quot;.  I guess this means they were lying.  Fortunately, my job
didn't require it (although it *did* require working in the immediate
vicinity; I just wasn't required to breathe).
