Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

Okay, I knew that I should have researched what I was told before I
posted to the list. I hate to get the terminology wrong. They were
indeed talking about the plungers and the long &amp; short spring being
inverted.

It turns out that I'm not able to pick it up yet, of course. The oil
pressure is still ~90psi and they fear that I might blow another filter
during the normal warm-up period. They are trying to find ways to bring
that down so I don't run into trouble.

Any thoughts? Thinner oil has been suggested, but maybe there are some
other methods? I am not sure of the performance of the oil pump and it
has been suggested that it is a &quot;high-pressure&quot; unit...

i don't think there is any physical way for the long spring to fit in
the
front (short) relief hole, especially with a plunger in there too. i
could
see the short one in the rear hole though, but the long one in the
short?
i'd like to see that.

&gt;   Could they have meant the plungers?  Or was the long spring and the
short
&gt; spring reversed.
&gt;

&gt;

&gt; Well, it turns out that the springs in the oil pump were reversed. Not
&gt; sure how *that* happened, but just glad that it's well again. I'm
going
&gt; to pick it up now...
