Subject: Re: [VB] #3 and #4 weak spark

Hey Charles,
I had the same prob on a 1600 dp. It turned out that
the head on 3 &amp; 4 side had become loose. Pulled the
engine, retorqued, and it fired properly again, but
the head bolts kept backing off. That's a whole other
story, but just wanted to let ya know that was the
problem with mine, head was loose and sucking air.

&gt; I can't figure out why my #3 and #4 aren't firing
&gt; very hot.  The engine seems to be running mostly on
&gt; the #1 and #2 cylinders.  When I pull the #1 or #2
&gt; plug wire from the distributor while its running,
&gt; the engine noticably reacts, but if I pull the #3 or
&gt; #4 wires barely anything.  I readjusted the valves
&gt; and they were tight on #3 and #4.  Afterwards the
&gt; spark to #3 and #4 was hotter but still not like #1
&gt; or #2.  I'm running a newly rebuilt 1904cc.The
&gt; timing is set to 5 BTDC, and valves set to .004
&gt; (with chrome  molly push rods). The plugs, wires,
&gt; rotor, points, cap and coil are all new....any
&gt; ideas?
