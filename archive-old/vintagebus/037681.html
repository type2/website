Hi Volks,
We got to the Burger Meat on Friday night arriving about 7PM from leaving her 
Dad's place in North Seattle area.  Weather was warm in the high 60Fs and a 
nice breeze.  Lots of local VWs overfilled the parking lot of the Burger 
Master drive in and some VWs had to park as usual in the nieghboring Safeway 
store parking lot.  Visited with many old friends whom we had not seen much 
in the past year, while walking around to both look and video all of the 
ACVWs we could see.  We had a chicken sandwich, choclate and blackberry 
shakes, curly fries and onion rings.  Yum!  Finally left about 9PM with the 
sun setting and high thin sparce cirrus clouds turning golden in the sky.  
Got to sleep after 11PM.

Got up at 5AM Saturday morning.  Eric ate a prepoured bowl of ceral and got 
out on the road to the Vintage Meet at 5:20AM and got there about 530AM to 
clear blue sky weather.  He was the first Cascade Kombis club member there 
and helped at the gate till 730AM.  Barb stayed at her Dad's place to go back 
to sleep in till 7AM when her dad got up.  She and her sister took thier dad 
out to the local garage style swap meet at the Puget Park drive in movie 
theater.  Where Barb found a dealer give away matchbook from Hub City Motors 
&amp; Equipment LTD. in Prince George, B.C. (Canada).  It has a Ruby Red late 
63-64 bug on the front with the title &quot;Relieves Gas Pains&quot;  with &quot;VOLKSWAGEN&quot; 
at the bottom.  While on the back is a 64 sunroof delux R/W with a bunch of 
childern being helped into the bus through the cargo doors helped by a mom 
looking gal while other childern hanging out the sunroof and front slider 
windows, with the title &quot;It Loves Childern&quot;.  After taking turns pushing 
thier dad in his wheel chair around the swap they drove down to the Vintage 
Meet to drop off Barb about 10:30AM to find Eric in the swap area.  
  The sun got above the trees and really heated the Vintage meet into the 
high 70Fs.  We found three doghouse fans with two of them with the exhaust 
shell and tube still attached.  A complete early 60s bug VOA hitch.  Two 
Germen manufactured rear 64-67 bus wheel (Slave) cylinders.  A friend of our 
was selling several NOS ACVW industrial motor rear engine tins and he thought 
they were for 40HP due to no sealing provided around the heat riser holes, 
but they had the right side preheat tube hole through them like for use with 
the 1500 bus aircleaner.  We bought one of those.  Got a Bendix speaker out 
of a bus speaker bracket for free from our good friend VW John.  Bought a 
Blaupunkt speaker and the bracket to mount it in a bug.  Both speakers have 
torn paper cones, but we are going to have a bunch of these reconed somday!  
A rusty dented German domed hub cap for free to later straighten out and have 
powder coated gray for one of our work buses.  Found a doghouse exhaust shell 
and two type 3 heater boxes with the insulation panels on them that we reuse 
on our type 1&amp;2 heat exchangers for more winter heat.  Also bought a mint 
used 68-79 bus Bentley VW Service Manual and a complete slightly used muffler 
for 68-71 bus for Eric's sister.
  Visited many of our old swap and show friends.  Don from the SE (Alabama?) 
of the USA had flown in and Brax from Montana was there selling along with 
many, many others.  Jeff Slater and Darin Matsuno had thier Spilt Windows 
there.  There was a long line up of Split Screens of all types there and 
another line of bugs, KGs, Things, type 3s, and late model buses and trucks.
  We walked around and around the swap area and show car area video taping as 
much of the meet show &amp; swap as possible.  There was more swappers than ever! 
 About 25% less show cars and maybe 10% less walk in volks probably due to 
the magazine calender date error.  Finally left the meet at 3PM to finish up 
the day taking care of Harry and getting to bed after 11PM.

  We got up at 5:30AM so Eric could grab again a prepoured the night before 
bowl of ceral and out the door before 6:00AM to fill up the 1960 panel camper 
conversion's 1968-71 fifteen gallon gas tank and the spare tire gas tank..  
Barb went back to sleep in till 7:00AM to help her dad up and they figured 
out that the weather was too bad for the local Puget Park swap meet.  So she 
loaded all the stuff we had to get back South to our Oly place.  With Gasket 
the cat and her dad Harry for the 1-1/2 hour drive.
  Eric's drive started to SIR out in a heavy mist that was almost a sprinkle, 
but by the time South Seattle was passing by on I-5S the wet weather was 
gone, dry roadway and lighter clouds over head.  Switched over to 405N, then 
167S and onto 18E out to the SIR (Seattle International Raceway) exit.  By 
the time he got out there at 6:50AM the line was just out to the public 
roadway just off highway 18.  About half an hour later the raceway folks 
opened thier first gate.  Where the one long line turned into two lines at 
the second and final gate.  Eric's Sister had just recently bought her first 
VW buses last month after ten years of being out of VW since she sold us her 
first VW a 1958 sunroof.  A running 1968 Candian camper conversion with full 
length though a bit thin widthwise straight up poptop and a 1971 Westie 
without motor for $900.00, so she had arranged to meet Eric in the SIR line 
to get in early before the general public was let in at 900AM. Talked awhile 
with each other and other early morning VW fiends till the gates opened.  
Apperantly there was camping allowed inside the raceway the night before and 
lots of buses of all years, types and tents were there!  About half of the 
swappers that had been at Vintage were at SIR, it was a good turn out for a 
cloudy threatening rain day.   Sis and Eric found three bare dual relief 1600 
engine cases with a little weathering on them.  So far one of these opened 
later turned out to be a Standard used bore and perfect thrust!   Bought 
another bare and a longblock core dual relief engines.  Purchased two child 
cots one for 68-72ish and the other with U-channel shaped bars later type.  
Located a big diameter late model lower preheat metal tube for sis and 
another one for our supplies.  Bought a rusty dented type three rear bumper 
for the backup lights on it for sis to use on her bus rear bumper for extra 
turn signals.  Picked up a free 73ish-79 bus FI gas tank to later cut up with 
bronze chisel, then clean out any gas varnish out of the halfs via a camp 
fire and reweld into a 20 gallon tank in one of our 63 SCs.  Bought a set of 
new rebuilt late pre-1968 or just post-1967 bus rear brake shoes.  Even found 
a used German made pair of 34mm wide cooling fans especially for the doghouse 
shrouds.
  Eric and his Sister wandered through the show cars.  Lots of rediculus 
water cooled ones, quite a few bugs and two yellow 72-75 westie campers from 
Saskatchewan Canada, plus a really nice green/white 65ish SO-42 Westie.  Sis 
went nuts while taking a long gander at the late model westie campers one of 
which had a photo album of the grimy rescue from sitting/sunk by a barn thru 
restoration on thru completion.
  We left before noon and had enjoyed the cooler cloudier, but dry weather.  
Seemed like only half the normal walk in volks made it in by the time we 
left.  Sis heading back North to Kirkland and Eric heading South to the 
Olympia area.  Both due to time and Eric being too tired to video around at 
SIR unfortunitly.
