Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment

Hook a hose to your hot water heater, if you can.  Crank
the temp all the way up.  Hot water - even by itself - goes
a long way in degreasing an engine...

&gt; wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk out of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple green and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a little paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats left of the original paint.
