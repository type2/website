&lt;&lt; If the tranny leaks oil at a rate of about 5 tablespoons a day, how many 
days until I need to get under there and top it off again?  It took 12 fl. 
Ozs. this morning after it had been sitting for three months. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
If it has been leaking that much sitting it will just leak even more when you 
driven!  Best bet is just to fix it....    Otherwise slide under at least 
every other day and check the gear oil level by finger.    Eric&amp;Barb
