Subject: Barndoor Antenna?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com (VintageBus List)
Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 14:50:03 -0700 (PDT)

I'm trying to find out what antennas were available for barndoors.  I
have one in my posession that is purported to be a barndoor antenna, but
if it were placed on the nose of my bus, say just above the emblem,
it would protrude *forward* at about a 30 degree angle to the vertical
plane of the nose.

All the ones I've seen in pix go up from the base, then tilt backward,
being mounting dead center of the nose, running the mast up the windshield
pillar, utilizing a special rubber holder mounted on the windshield
pillar to stabilize the mast.

This one was supposed to come from Bill Derikx's stash.  Maybe I'm
trying to mount it wrong?

Thanks!

Thom
