&lt;&lt; Howdy. My roommate needs the rear apron, or valence, skirt or whatever you 
call
 the piece of metal that bolts on behind the engine. The piece of the body 
that
 attaches with 4 bolts that you remove to take the engine out. It's for a '67
 bus, but I believe 64-67 is the same. Some rust is ok, as well as small 
dents.
 This is not for a restoration, but rather a slightly rough driver bus, so it
 doesn't need to be pretty, just there and functional.
 Anyway, if you have one, please call Eric at 919-832-3691. He will be more 
than
 happy to work out the payment and details and such.
 Thanks!

59 though 65 are the same, for engine lids that take the church key.

66-67 are another kind, the latch on the lid with the push buttion attaches 
differently than the earlier kind.

If you put a 65 and earlier kind on a buis with a push button lid, the lid 
wont snap shut  :(
