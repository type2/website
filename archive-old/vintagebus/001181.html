I haven't done a whole lot to the bus over the past few days that was worth
writing about so I thought I would kind of save it up and make a post with
some substance.  Tonight I went over to the shop spent about an hour messing
around with my grandfather's webster chicago wire wheel recorder.  For those
of you who are too young to remember, back in the 40's and early 50's,
Webster in Chicago made an &quot;Electronic Memory Machine&quot; which used hair-thin
strands of wire on spools.  These wires were fed through an oscillating play
head and then using the same technique that cassette tape recorders use,
these wire recorders could record sound on the wire.  I found an early
version of one of these machines in a trash bin on Monday so my grandpa and
I have been working on fixing it up and we've actually got it to play.  The
sound is plagued with 60 cycle hum which is peculiar to this machine.  Can
anyone confirm my suspicion of a bad filter capacitor?  Anyway, we've
listened to some of the enclosed spools. The one has a guy saying the date
is 1950 and the other one had a neat old radio broadcast on it.
Unfortunately, the wire got away from me and I lost darn near the whole
spool - they're touchy little devils.  To see what I'm talking about, search
for webster wire recorder on ebay.

Anyway, moving on to the actual bus stuff.  I got the bus off the jackstands
tonight and moved out on the driveway so I could scrape and clean the floor.
With that aside, I rolled the bus in, blocked it, and toqued the rear axles
and kotter keyed into position.  The best part was doing the brakes tonight.
I used a one man bleeder which wasn't quite enough but it managed to get
fluid in the lines good enough.  Then I got my sister over at the shop to
run the brake pedal and each WC gave up it's air.  I'll write more later
when I'm conherent - I'm really tired.

BTW:  Those SS braided brakes lines make the brake pedal feel like I'm
hitting a brick wall!
