Not a lot in '65; you'd have euro segmented taillights, non-overider
bumpers, and asymmetrical bulb headlights.  You'd only have RHD in
England or Ireland, and Sweden until '67.  But not in Germany.

&gt; differant tail lights and bumpers,and of course opposite stearing.
&gt;   The reason I ask is one of my Air Force buddies has moved to Germany and I 
&gt; have a good hook up for parts.My bus is a basket case and I plan on builing 
&gt; a custom out of it,I thought some differant parts might be cool!
