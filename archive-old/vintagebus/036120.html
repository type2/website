Today after work I drove up I-5 to Oly.   went to Safeway, where I proceeded 
to procure 4th of July supplies.  After getting back in the bus the interior 
temperature guage read 115*F.   It is a high tech guage aka fridge magnet 
that has a London double deck bus with a thermometer in it, which is stuck to 
the over head vent cover.  I removed the 1x2 safari window prop I always use 
for freeeeway driving, and opened that pass side one well up.   Driving home 
it cooled down quickly, in spite of the fact I could not find my shades 
anywhere.  I thought they were on the dash tray.  Definately have to take 
your shades on and road trip, you know.    A spritzer bottle of water would 
have been nice

I can keep doing short boring trip reports...
