&lt;&lt; While we are on the subject, and while there is a visual aid, does anyone 
 have the chrome C clamp that hangs on the bumper to spare? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gary,
If you can not find this clamp to attach your hitch to your rear bumper you 
can improvise.  We use a flat piece of steel with one hole drilled through 
about it center.  Then place this piece of steel inside of the bumper on the 
lower edge, and bolt it to the hitch under the bumper.  This acts as a clamp 
holding the hitch very well!  All it needs to hold up &amp; down is over 200 Lbs.
