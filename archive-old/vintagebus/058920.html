Subject: RE: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler

&gt; I've poked around on the internet and have found a number of *German*
&gt; 1500 mufflers ranging anywhere from $62 at WW to $49 from Larry Reno at
&gt; wagenwerks.  Can anyone tell me who's *german* fits better or are they
&gt; all the same manufacturer?

&gt; I've used the german one marked Ernst. The muffler fit well,, but the
&gt; tailpipe braket has a gap between the tab and the tab that attaches to
&gt; the muffler itself. The side bracket (worked ok)  and tailpipe looks
&gt; correct. It was aquired as an entire kit through the busdepot_dot_com .



We sell the following German mufflers and exhaust systems. The earlier ones
are Leistritz, the later one Ernst. Both are OE suppliers to VW, and I have
not seen a significant difference in quality between the two brands. Both
are far superior to the Mexican, Brazilian, and even Danish ones that are
also available.  Prices include listmember discount.
