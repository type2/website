I wanted to offer this to the list before making a concerted effort to sell
it.
(made a half-hearted one at OCTO but I didn't stay around it long enough to
try and sell it.  Too many busses to look and and people to talk to.)

I have the beam which is wheel to wheel.
Beam, trailing arms, spindles, brakes, hubs off of my '60 Double cab

It was on the DC up until last month when I did the later model beam swap.

Has new brake cylinders and wheel bearings.

The bus has about 36k orig miles on it.  The rubber seals are shot on it.
(I'd like to see good 41 yr old rubbers)

I spent about 30 minutes cleaning it with a pressure washer removing the mud
buildup from its first life as a Mt. Shasta resort bus.  That volcanic clay
is tenacious stuff.  Did get a comment at OCTO that it was one of the
cleanest beams they had seen.

You could buy it to cover core charges on the link/king pin rebuilds or as a
replacement for a rusty worn out beam.

I was told that I should hold out for $150, but I'll entertain offers.

Heck, if you live in SoCal, I'll even throw it in the truck and deliver it
to you.

I'll get some photos and email them to anyone interested.
