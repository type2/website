Hey,

You don't have to read everything on the list. Just delete.

&gt; Hey Kabayo, and list administrators,
&gt;
&gt; May I speak frankly?  I'm also one of those listees who is
kinda sick and
&gt; tired of reading all of the Ebay posts on this list.  This
weakly related
&gt; stuff is consuming more and more of our time, making the
Vintagebus List a
&gt; little less and less valuable all the time.  If we want to
know about
&gt; what's goin' on over there, all of us can easily go there
to look for
&gt; ourselves.  This list is about Bus issues and help, and
the Ebay stuff is
&gt; wasting a lot of our time and the Lists bandwith.  If
we're collecting
&gt; comments here, I personally wish all the Ebay related sh%t
would be
&gt; banished.  Let's get back to pure Bus related
conversations, not Bus or VW
&gt; parts on auction site.
&gt;
&gt; I should shut up now, but I might as well say one more
thing.  Other than
&gt; the Ebay stuff, I find Kabayo's other posts are of value
and usually
&gt; entertaining.  But.....  Kabayo, is there any chance you'd
please consider
&gt; deleting that stupid political header at the end of your
messages?  That
&gt; truely has absolutely nothing to do with this list, and
many of us don't
&gt; really appreciate being preached to about non-Bus related,
political crap.
&gt; Please consider the rest of us and drop that header in the
future.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, I've finally come out and said it, so thanks for
listening and trying
&gt; to understand another point of view.
&gt;
