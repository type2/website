Subject: Re: [VB] packing oil pump for easier priming

You don't necessarily need to pull the pump, just take off the cover and
pull the gears out. I don't like having grease in my engine at all. It is
heat resistant so will not flow well. It can plug a push rod, can starve
your lifters for oil, and may float around for a long time in your engine
causing a little damage wherever it goes. I use assembly lube on all but the
lifters when building an engine that won't be started right away, and motor
oil if doing it quick. I always pack the pump with Vaseline. I run full flow
filters, and even with the filter prefilled, have had engines take a
considerable time to prime before. It is not worth the risk to avoid taking
such a basic precaution. Lots of folks don't check their lug nuts when they
leave the tire place. I'm not one of those people.

&gt; Well, I just finished getting my new motor put together, and per the
&gt; Wilson book packed the oil pump with grease to ease priming

&gt; If not, I'd like to know, as I'd prefer not to have to pull the
&gt; pump off...
