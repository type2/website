Subject: RE: [VB] Opinions needed on tire choice!

  I still prefer the Kumho or Nanking 195/14. Got over 40k out of Nanking
guiet and not to harsh of a ride. Kumho seem stiffer. I have Uniroyal
Lorado's on another bus now 195/14, these are also guiet but with a harsher
ride. All the above listed tires cost less then 250 dollars a set mounted
and balanced. If I had the dough to spend I would have Michilen (spelling?)
Agilias. These are the guietess, smoothest tire I have ever driven a bus on,
but at approx 125 dollars a piece I can put 2 sets of tires on my other
buses for the price of 1 set of Agilias.

Listees,

I'm about to commit myself and my bus to a new set of Bridgestone RD603's,
sized: 185R14. I did all the research, waded thru our archives, a dozen
tire sites, took notes, etc. Then I went down to the first place on my
tire-dealer list and said I need tires for that (pointing to the bus). The
guy said - I know exactly  what you need. I thought to myself, here we go,
another bs trip. But he got on the phone, and ten minutes later announced
that he had four on the way, and they were the RD603's.

This tire has been mentioned in several posts with positive comments, and
this guy hadn't seem my note sheet, so I'm thinking he really *does* know.

Anyway, long babble, if anyone has experience with this tire to share,
lemmee know quick, as I'll be buying them in a day or two.

Thanks in advantage!
