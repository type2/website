Subject: Drove the Ark, no reverse

We went down the street and back under our own power!  Too cool.
Rebuilt Carb today and installed a fuel pump. 'twas a combination of 
factors that made her not run.  Thanks to Clara who replied to my last
post
and suggested I do the carb.  Wife set the timing, helped do carb
rebuild, she installed the fuel pump, helped with tinware, muffler
install
and bumper.  Pumped up the flat read tyres and down the road we went, 
giggling all the way down our dead end street.  She's sweet!!!

Brakes braked, ran up &amp; down all the forward geard slicker than
anything.
Pulled into the last driveway on the street.  Went to back out.

No reverse.

Tranny's nice and quiet, shifts smooth going ahead.  Ant and all
thoughts
or suggestions are, as always, miost welcome.
