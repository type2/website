&gt; True Story: when i first moved to houston, my girlfriend's dad said:
&gt; &quot;nowah, if ya'll go ahtsahd in the moanin and see littul gray specks on
&gt; youah cah, don leave em thar... it'll et the paint off.&quot;

My 2nd wife lived two blocks from the Shell refinery in Deer Park.  Had a
white and black speckled 67 Ford Fairlane when I met her.
I had a 67 westy and we met kayaking on the upper Guadalupe.  I used to
pile 7 big old fiberglass boats on top of it.
I remember camping in it with all the jalousie windows open and feeling
like I couldn't breathe.  Mosquitoes and stuff too.  Now I'm spoiled.

&gt; i bought the bus and got a driver's license at the age of 25 to get OUT of
&gt; houston...........

This is all extremely familiar.
