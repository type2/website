Mornin' all!
I managed to drill through my left e-brake cable while installing a middle 
seat a while back (P.O. welded in a 3/16 steel plate when the floor rusted 
through).  After saying some unkind words, I accepted the fact that I get to 
do an e-brake cable and what better excuse for complete rear brakes that 
that eh?

Ordered the parts, they got here the other day and so yesterday I loosned 
the axle nuts, jacked the rear of the Tinkertoy up, and pulled tires, drums 
etc.  My right axle stub has a bit of play, so I thought I'd do the basic 
diagnostic of changing the poopy juice in red gears and tranny long as I'm 
at it.
The tranny has a couple of the magnetic plugs and there was a small amount 
of metal stuck to the magnets.  No big chunks or lumps of synchro pieces 
came out of the tranny.  Left side reduction gear box came out kinda like 
honey.  Maybe it was the spider web that made it look that way.  Right side 
(with the play) came out clean too.  A couple metal chips (no magnetic 
plug), but nothing major.

I've seen more chips from the tranny in my 76 BMW 2 wheeler and it still 
shifts just fine.  So today I'll finish the brake job under the supervision 
of Derek the Wonderwrench (he's got a tweaked knee and is bored sitting 
around the house) {besides, he can pump the brake pedal with his good leg!}. 
  Will letcha know how it went.  Probably do a writeup for the NEATO mag 
'cause I promised Dave E I'd submit something..

Have fun and if all you do is look at your bus you should give it to me to 
drive!

Mad Uncle Dave
