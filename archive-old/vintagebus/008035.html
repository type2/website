&gt; Take out the studs, and put the case halves in the diswasher; crank up the
&gt; water heater as high as it will go first.
&gt;
&gt; Then find a good divorce attorney.
&gt;
&gt; When I build my new shop out back, I'll be installing a cheepie diswasher
&gt; for the express purpose of washing VW parts.  And an oven for heating
parts.

Good ideas Thom!  I already have a dish washer and when I used it to wash
parts with and announced it to the list, I was promptly knocked of my
pedestal by project greenworthy.  It seems I offended some pro-bio people.
Now I just wash my parts in secret.

I like the idea about the stove though.  That's great!  I know the local
guru uses an electric hot plate cranked up to full to put the gears on a VW
crank.  That was one of the neatest tricks I ever saw.

Thanks for the ideas - I'll have to incorpate them into my shop.
