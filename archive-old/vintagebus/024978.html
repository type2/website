Subject: more on models
Message-ID: &lt;3704F2CF.710F_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

Hope no-one minds me writing on the list about models of Kombi's, but
today I had an interesting find that has led to a bit of confusion that
hopefully someone on the list can shed some light on for me.
I was given by a friend an English made Matchbox model of a b_at_y window
Dormobile made in 1970.  It looks like a '70 bus except it has the pre
'64 smaller hatch.  Is this possible to have the small hatch on a b_at_y or
is it just an error in reproduction?

Thanks, Daniel.
