&gt; As for myself, I
&gt; REALLY apologize for any misgiving that I may have caused to ANYONE on the
&gt; list.  For myself, I'll learn to 1: be a bit more clear in my posted
&gt; questions, and 2: grow a thicker skin :)
&gt; 

Hello Drew     I think you will find that you will be readly accepted and 
that the fact is that you are learning  LOL   I like everybody on this list 
wishes that everybody that posted would give all the correct info when doing and 
some have to be told to do so,  A thicker skin helps a lot. A couple of years 
ago I gave Karl hell about never signing his posts and he replied that everybody 
knew who he was . So I grew thicker skin also LOL   Things are done 
differently in other parts of the world and you have to respect that. This doesn't mean 
you have to agree, just respect it.  Karl will be the first to give you all 
the part numbers , just like Richard Ratwell will give all the pixs,  Then 
there the guys like me who can only give you 40 years of experience . The fact is 
this is the best list there is for any tech problems dealing with VWs   later 
and have fun  mark Dearing
