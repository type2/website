Hello all!

Just curious about Bus books.  Specifically, those that list the
various years and the dates or chassis numbers that certain changes
occurred.  So far I've come up with the following:

Bentley notes some changes but they're all over the book

Muir has a brief list in the back
 - -- -  --

the best is a nice collection of parts lists, with the editions put out at 
diff times.   I have seen 56, 58, 59, 61, 63, mid 67, and 1970 editions of 
the splitty parts list.  The earlier books are better for the earlier buses 
in some ways, as they list the variety of part that came on t, the later ones 
cover later buses and have supercessions for the earlier stuff, and of course 
some stuff was NLA and not listed..  

It does not read like you might expect.    You look up say, gearshift rod, by 
flipping to the levers section (7) finding the picture, identifying the part, 
then finding it in the list, which lists it by part number, with info as what 
model it was used on, how many per bus, and what chassis numbers the version 
of the part ws used on.

I think it would be very difficult to write a comprehensive book of changes 
for the public.   Would it be organised by year, by part section, by model ?? 
    which changes do you include, and which do you eave out?    NEATO/BK/SSVC 
put out a nice pamphet a couple years ago, but it was not well edited for 
accuracy .  

Some changes are not listed anywhere That I can see, you just have to look at 
a lot of buses.  Also  the numbers in the lists can be off-   like the dates 
in the production line.- that recent thread.    My 61 should have a round 
corner dash pod by its vin, but its dash pod is pointy.   It is 36 numbers 
after the change as listed.  whatever,  like some of those buses must have 
been pulled off he line for extra work (like deluxes etc.)    do you want 
pictures of all the colours of headliners material?
