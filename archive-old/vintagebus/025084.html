As a new subscriber I would like to say HELLO to the vintagebus list.

Hi there.

I have been into VWs for about 15 years now and one of my first VWs was
a 57 Panel Bus from a volunteer fire department
that I got with about 35tmls on the speedo.
I drove it as a daily driver for a few years and took it from northern
Germany as far as Marocco and Portugal.
I became one of the early members of the Bulli Kartei in Germany (#58)
and drove to a lot of meetings.
Even after not driving it anymore I hung on to it for quite a few years.
A restoration always seemed unjustified, as
Panels are not worth anything in Germany, and just a paint job would
have exceeded its value. Also parts were almost
unavailable in those years. A 57 Panel is also not really a comfortable
car for travelling long distances. I moved on
to the second generation Bus and was happy, while still going to Bus
meetings. I
sold the 57 a few years back to a local VW dealer, unfortunately I also
sold most of the NOS parts I had collected over the
years.

A few weeks ago I caved in again. Now temporarily living in Huntsville,
Alabama, I came across a 67 Westfalia in what
seemed to be an acceptable condition. I really don't need a Camper as I
already have a pristine 72 Westy, but an original, untouched,
un-messed-up, bad-but-original paint, 12 V, walkthrough Westy was just
too tempting. After all I need something to fiddle
with.
Well, the rust turned out to more than anticipated (and I thought I was
too experienced for that to happen to me), but
still I am happy.
Everything technical will need to be replaced. The front end is the
worst I have ever seen. The tie rod ends are about to
pop out their sockets, the king pins seem to have no bushings around
them, the engine is dead, all rubber parts are shot.
Yet, when checking the parts situation I was nicely surprised. Almost
everything is available nowadays, and most of the stuff is
really cheap compared to what I am used to. I am used to Vanagon Syncro
prices (a short encounter with VWs version of the
devil on wheels) and type IV engine parts prices. Compared to that I
felt like I could build a splitty from new parts.
Things have definitely improved in the last 15 years.

Unfortunately I sold most of my splitty parts accumutated over the
years, but I did find some stuff. I even located a perfect set of safari
windows that I did not have the heart to sell and hung on to (in Germany
an American once offered me $60, I declined), it even has
the new seals I bought for it at VW all those years ago. Those safaris
were a souvenir from Portugal, where I bought a total of 12 pairs on
junkyards, sold them, and kept the best pair.
I could kick myself now for always selling all the 64-67 kingpin sets I
came across. For those parts the availability has gotten worse.
In Germany I still have a Westy roofrack, but I have no clue on how to
get it here (airlines have become touchy on carry-on luggage).
But at least my library is still complete. I still got all the original
parts manuals and work shop manuals. This will help.

Some things I still have not figured out on where to get them or whats
original, so I will post some questions to this list
in the future.

Some &quot;Wanted items&quot; for example are:

plastic trim inside the canvas top nailed to the wood
original style rubber lip on pop top
water reservoir with cap
engine compartment lid
one crank for louvered window
plastic floor material
the little clip the table is supposed to snap into
and who sells the best sheetmetal?

and of course a cool Westy tent to go with the car.
Were the tents a standard equipment on all US Westies?
