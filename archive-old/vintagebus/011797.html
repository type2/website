	Well I am taking the proactive choose in working on my 69 bus and
I have adjusted the points gap, timing, and idle but have a few
questions....

1. Even though my van is a 69 I can't assume that's the original motor
and year....Is there a stamping easily visible while the motor is
installed so I can look it up?

2.If it is a 69 type 2 bus it should be statically set for 0 deg TDC...?

3.I know for sure the carb is after 70 cause it has the fuel adjustment
screw as well as the air idler screw...

4. If the engine pings while going up hills or during a load is the
timing to far advanced....Advanced meaning 1degree or higher.....or is it
under timed?....-1 degree or lower....

Thanks for any help I appreciate it..

Greg
