POR-15 might be a solution here although to repair rust holes without
cutting and welding try their POR PUTTY or POWER MESH Reinforcing Fabric.
Both should work great for the time being. As far as preparing metal for POR
15 I don't think you should worry much about Marine Clean and Metal Ready.
These things combined could be pretty costly. Try plain simple Parts Cleaner
or Mineral Spirits. Always worked for me. Now for the glass part, I saw some
windshield glass in a catalog from BFY OBSOLETE PARTS at $35.00 a pop. Check
if they still have these. And....Good luck with your bus! Don't worry about
the rust since she's 34 years old and is allowed to have some here and
there. Think about some of the modern cars, some only 10-15 years old and
already &quot;gone&quot;.

&gt; On to the problem at hand.  RUST.  Icky flaky nasty bus-killing stuff.
Upon
&gt; close inspection, my 66 has A LOT of it.  I mean everywhere.  Too much to
try
&gt; and replace everything (I'd have a whole new bus!) but I would like to
stop
&gt; the spread if I could.  If I can keep it at bay then perhaps the bad spots
&gt; can be cured later when I have more cash, more time and a few welding
&gt; tutorials under my belt.
&gt;
&gt; I have read with great interest the letters about POR15 and am quite
certain
&gt; that this is the product of choice, but I have a few questions about it.
My
&gt; trusty Rocky catalog lists POR15 Metal-Ready, POR15 Marine Clean, and
POR15
&gt; Rust Preventative Paint.  Are all three of these products necessary for
the
&gt; prevention and/or inhibition of rust?  From the description Metal-Ready
and
&gt; Marine-Clean seem to do the same thing but MR mentions bare metal where as
MC
&gt; does not.  Hmmm.  This is going to be my first true attempt at rust repair
&gt; and I want to do it right (as right as I can without cutting out the bad
&gt; metal and welding in new metal).
&gt; Do I have to sand away to bare &quot;virgin&quot; metal or can I just sand the bad
area
&gt; smooth and go from there?  On my window sills, sanding to clean metal will
&gt; remove most of the lip.  The metal is sturdy but definitely rust damaged.
&gt; Can I just break off the loose pieces, clean it up real nice and POR15 it?
&gt; Is this a wasted effort?
&gt;
&gt; And last but not least, can anyone recommend a good source for windshield
&gt; glass?  I have seen glass for $150.00 a pair as well as $45 a piece.  Why
the
&gt; price differences?  Is the more expensive glass worth the investment or is
&gt; glass glass.  Is Securit glass collectible glass to be pillaged or is it
&gt; readily available at your favorite VW supplier?  I'm not a NOS snob but
most
&gt; of my glass is Securit so it would be cool to keep it uniform.
