Subject: synchros

Hey...I'm not too much of a tranny guy here (yet :-)  but I have an
idea....it may work...it may just be me babbling.
A lot of people seem to have their trannies rebuilt.... when you rebuild
them can you replace the synchros with non-brass synchros?  or are all
synchros brass?  can they even be replaced?  Then this could eliminate
the GL-5 worries no?

any thought on this would be very appreciated as I'd like to know more
about trannies anyways.

oh yeah...on a lighter note... my shop teacher today tried to tell me
that all vehicles that have rear wheel drive have a drive shaft
(singular) such as ones running from front to rear.  so I told him about
my bus and the other ACVWs.... his face got red....it was great.  earned
me an extra point on my test too!
