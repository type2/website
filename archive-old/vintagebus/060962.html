Subject: Re: [VB] Re: fresh air vent cover goo

Not sure if it's the same stuff for you David, but Dum-
Dum is one name for a 3M firewall sealant found at FLAPS 
or an Auto Body/Paint supply. You can look up a cheap on-
line source I've referenced in the past. Some have 
called it butyl rubber, but it seems more clay like than 
rubber. The 1&quot; strips I use on the DC's safaris during 
the rainy season aren't reuseable but work well for 3-4 
months in all kind of driving. It falls apart when 
pulling it off. 

That tacky poster putty is found in most stationery 
stores. DON'T use it on your vintige Jimi or Janis 
posters, the oil in it will seep into paper eventually.

&gt; I'm not familar with the RV putty suggested.  The plumber's putty
&gt; suggested, I've found, eventually hardens.  I agree that the top and two
&gt; side seals are rubber strip (with holes for the screws) and that the
&gt; bottom is a pliable rubberish &quot;goo.&quot;
