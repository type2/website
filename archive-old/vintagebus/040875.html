&gt;Hello all, Hey I gota a quick question. My res is leaking right above
&gt;the screw that goes into the brake cyl. I put some RTV all  around it in
&gt;hopes this would fix the problem of leakage. Any reason why this won't
&gt;work?

Yes, actually. The reservoir is made from UHMW, an industrial variation on
polyethylene, the same stuff milk jugs are made of. NOTHING sticks to it,
it's known as 'poor man's Teflon'. The only way to attach to UHMW is heat
welding. If the reservoir is not cracked, the leakage is probably due to the
seal (or lack of) between it and the M/C.
