Phil,

You really don't need the snap ties. My VW fuel line piece lasted for over
20 years, until I finally rerouted the fuel line through the firewall to
the left of the engine.

&gt; Good advice - the original metal fuel line on my 70 was almost cut thru by
&gt; the sheet metal in spite of the original rubber grommet that I religiously
&gt; replaced at each engine removal. I now split a new piece of fuel hose to fit
&gt; over the new gas line and then clamp it in place with a couple of snap ties
&gt; on each side of the sheet metal.
