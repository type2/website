Subject: no power in 4th

I'm in the process of putting a vw back on the road. 1600cc DP 
engine. changed the oil and gas. adjusted the valves. did a few other 
things and fired it up. When I got it on the road I was able to do 
good shifting through the gears. There was some hesitation at low 
RPM's until the engine warmed up...when it minimized enough to not be 
a big deal. There's  009 in there right now, which might be why it 
has the &quot;flat spot&quot;.

So it seems to run fine until I get to 4th gear. When I get to 4th it 
just doesn't seem to have any power for some reason. All the other 
gears do fine, but at 4th no matter how much gas I give it, the 
engine basically stays at low RPM's.

I havn't adjusted the carb yet, or even set the timing. Also havn't 
changed the fuel filter or the plugs or the points yet. I gotta make 
a run to my FLAPS to get the stuff.

Dipstick is cool to the touch. Engine doesn't seem to run hot at all.

So I'm thinking the carb is running lean. Sound like it might be 
right? It's an aftermarket 34-PICT. Has a 1989 date on it. Bocar or 
Brosal.._dot_can't remember. Anyway, I guess I'll ge to adjusting it.

Any comments appreciated.
