Anohter factor to keep in mind, in addition to the very important task of
bushing lubrication, is that should the bolt that is also pulling double
duty as an engine mounting bolt, and yes the one that is such a BIG PITA
to tighten on ones own and yes isn't always tightened enough, well if it
is loose, that too will not sit well with a new bushing, let alone an old
one!

&gt; grease the inside of the bushing or apply some grease to the starter tip that
