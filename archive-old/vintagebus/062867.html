Subject: RE: [VB] More dizzy info

  We just finished discussing the dizzys and doing some mikeing on them. I
am going up there tomorrow and see if they will build me one Toyota dizzy
with an adjustable timing curve. They do these for the race engines. On
another topic we finished discussing cams and came up with a couple of ideas
to build the ultimate small bore bus cam. With Geoff's engine and racing
engine experience and years of dyno sheets,  we are going to work on the
ultimate bus cam, of course I get to be the quiney pig. He came up with a
lot of interesting points and when we have more time I hope to discuss the
cam issue more. An interesting comment from Geoff was that almost all
aftermarket cams already have 3 or more degrees of advance built into them,
also depending on who's cam dear you use you could even be adding more, thus
the importance of degreeing in a non stock cam.

ronnie  just one mans opinion and curiosity

   I was on the phone with L C  about using the Toyota dizzy and was
informed that a Chevy Monza dizzy will also work. This evening we are going
to meet and discuss the possabilities of producing these with different
advance curves for different applications. 

ronnie  research research

I would definitely be interested in curves for stage two and above engine
cams, and various #3 distributor retard cams.
