was writ:

I just received some popouts for my 66 crewcab.  I
haven't had a chance to test fit them, but I'd like to
know a few things...

Are all popouts from 67 down the same dimensions?  I
know the latches were changed at some point (62/63?),
but I haven't heard if the height x width ever
changed.
 -- - --  -
the frames were the same from early 54 through 67.  the lacthe attaches 
differently to the framand the frame sis different on the early BDs and they 
use that frame also on the earlier crew cabs.  dunno why, less sturdy design.

look for rust, these frame stend to rust.  Be very careful undoing the screw. 
 the frames are in two parts (look in your bentley) and at each seam have two 
screws holding he pieces together.  use penerating oil, a correct size 
screwdriver, and a light hammer to tap the end of the screwdriver.   Repeat 
this eery day for a week before even attempting to undo the screws.   
drilling out screws here is not fun, and also I hear that finding replacement 
screws is hard.

The frames were painted the same as the top colour of the bus, whatever it 
was.
