Subject: Apples/Oranges (Hoover Disk/Archive Disk)



Anyone who has been around the lists since 1998  will remember Bob 
Hoover. Opinions varied but many considered him the elder statesman 
of air-cooled VW mechanics. Hoover's legendary posts to the 
lists(Vanagon and Type2 at that time) were gathered, indexed and put 
on one page of www.type_dot_com with Bob's permission. After a period of 
time, Bob Hoover requested that the page be removed by Ken Hooper, 
web-master and domain owner of type2_dot_com, who did so immediately.

The demise of the Sermons was not sudden or even unexpected but by 
many it was considered an unfortunate loss of a valuable resource. 
There were many requests that the info contained on the Sermons page 
be made available again. Various pleas were made publicly and 
privately for the info to be put back on the Internet or be made 
available for purchase on CD.

Bob Hoover agreed to a CD release and Ken Hooper agreed to edit the 
Sermons Disk and find a way to distribute it. Eventually Ron Salmon 
of Bus Depot agreed to be the retail outlet for the Sermons Disk. The 
Sermons disk was never intended to be freely distributed or sold 
without profit to the parties involved in the production or 
distribution of the Sermons disk. The profit aspect of the CD was no 
secret. Anyone who implies that it was a secret could be misinformed 
or attempting to discredit those involved in its production and 
profit of the Sermons CD.

How much money was made and by whom?  I don't know or care but I do 
know the difference between an apple and an orange. What a tangled 
web we weave.............
