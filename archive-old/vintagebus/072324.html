Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Problem

When did these problems start? Or is this bus new to you? Sounds like you 
have more than 1 single issue. Start at the fuse box, sounds like its not wired 
right there. Get the proper wire diagram for your bus (you didnt say what year) 
from this sites archive area. And above all listen well and do whatever Matt 
Roberds tells you to do.
