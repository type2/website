Subject: Middle Seat grab bar

Happy New Year Bus list!

My '66 Deluxe middle seat is a 1/4 fold down and on the top of the fold down
seat as well as the stationary upright seat back are the tubes where the
grab bar mounts to.  I currently have 3 of the 4 aluminum elbows that slide
into the top of the seat.  My question is this, does anyone have an extra
right side elbow and also, what is the material that attaches to these
elbows?  I have looked at pictures at the Samba and it looks as if the
material is a white tube.  What material?

Thanks
