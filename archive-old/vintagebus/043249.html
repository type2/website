I have several motors I'm thinking about putting up for long time storage.
I am going to drain what oil is in them now and then fill them all the way
to the top of the oil filler with oil.
I'm wondering if it would be unwise to use the oil I have in large
quantities that has been &quot;used&quot; in other motors for those 3000 mile oil
change intervals?
Just trying to save some $$, but if it's going to cost me more down the
road by trying to save a few pennies now I wouldn't do it obviously.
I will most likely drain them down and repeat this next summer.
Thanks
later
