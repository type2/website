Hmmm, got me on that one. I've converted SP to dog house coolers many times
and the rod fits the same through SP heads from a SP fan shroud or a DP fan
shroud. Maybe your flap rod is bent or there is debris in the head fin area.
It is also possible that the small piece of sheet metal on the head is bent in
some way. This has happened to me from the treads on the bottom of the flap
rod catching the edge of tin on its way out.

&gt; The Dual Port doghouse thermostat rod
 runs differently through the heads than the Single Port heads, does anyone
 have that answer?  I know there's others out there with that same question.

I am still looking for the answer.
I finally gave up and just use the spring to hold them open. I figure having
the flaps in and open all the
time is better than no flaps at all. The outside temps here in Fresno are
lukewarm to hot......
