&gt; Yup, turning also helps keep the supply chain moving. Why with a combination

&gt; enough brake drums to make sure they remain available.

exactly...
the brake parts people wouldn't mind, anyways... ;)
though i think most of the acvws' OE shoes and pads are organic, not metallic.
brake drums are not &quot;forever parts&quot;... they are going to eventually wear past
specified limits, whether or not you have them turned. The rule of thumb is to
replace any drum worn .060&quot; over the standard size, if the discard number is
illegible or not present....
    organic vs. semi-metallic vs. full metallic... fade point ballparks: 550
degrees, 800 degrees, 1000 degrees, respectively... the metallics are harder on
drums and rotors, but the flip side to this is the higher fade points... more
brakes yet increased wear. still, IMHO, you can't go wrong with OE parts.... a
lot of engineering and metallurgy and different disciplines go into selecting
brake parts... the mantra: &quot;o.e., o.e., o.e......&quot;
    IIRC the last set of bus shoes i ordered was organic... if I had the option
of semi-metallics, I would give them a try... as I try to be easy on the brakes.
brakes will last a long time, given an attentive driver (as we all know....)..

&gt; I still am amazed
&gt; that accelerating the removal of material from the drums is considered to be
&gt; a benefit. It defies logic.

turning the drums...
A. restores the drum's coefficient of friction. someone with worn-smooth drums
will not stop as quickly as someone who has had their drums turned...
B. trues the drum so that we have proper shoe-to-drum contact... helps for out
of roundess, taper...
    some claim that out of round drums will eventually return to normal... I
have heard of this on the List before... if the brakes get overly hot the drum
can become out of round... but this ought to be a signal, just like stepping on
a rake... that we could perhaps approach braking in a different light. i suppose
i shall have to start parking only in level spots... chock the wheels and sit
there till the drum temperatures go down... ;)
C. removes the build-up of &quot;glaze&quot; on the drum as well... (&quot;glaze&quot; is bonding
material that has melted out of the shoe lining, and collected on the
drum...)....
    making the vehicle stop as fast and as safely as it did when it left the
showroom is IMHO logical.

&gt; I have been known to get in there and scratch
&gt; them up with some good 40 grit sandpaper if they start squeaking, but I'll
&gt; just let the material wear away as it is intended otherwise, thank you.

if you are a good sander-of-drums, you can pretty well knock out A and C of the
above... for the price of a good dial indicator/base/etc. to check B, though,
you could have A and B and C taken care of anyways... several times over.

&gt; Lifetime pads are warrantied, but the drums they are eating up aren't.

shoe-to-pad conversion kits? or some twisted Celebrity Deathmatch? :)
it's a catch, yes... but then again you will run into these problems with the
discount auto stores and their *cheap* parts... there are several different
grades of pads &amp; shoes...

&gt; Keep
&gt; your brakes in top shape,

that's what i'm trying to encourage... any certified technician who cares to
regurgitate their professional training will tell you the same thing. I know i
take a hardline view of brake system upkeep, but this is another area where
techs whose work is on the line don't ever want to hear about a catastrophic
failure....

&gt; keep them adjusted, never run them till they
&gt; groove the drums and keep your money in your pocket.

How much money will a better brake system be worth in a panic stop situation
when you don't have an out? (was going to drag out the &quot;what about the
children?&quot; warhorse... naaah...)

&gt; I would stack the
&gt; brakes on my vehicles up against anybodies, but it ain't because I turn
&gt; them. It is because I maintain them and use them consciously.

braking is a serious safety issue...
turning out a dealer-quality brake job from the home garage is cost-prohibitive,
so people say...... (but still, think of the *labor* rates you are saving
on....!)...
people who do their own brakes do so mostly i think because they are trying to
save money... and us vw people are *especially* famous for cheaping-out on parts
and so on... just look at what people have been buying...
but doing it the &quot;proper&quot; way means you'll spend more money... on turnings and
drums, for example... and having shoes matched to drums... but it is cheap
insurance IMHO.
    where do you want to stop today?
