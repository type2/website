Subject: howabout stock tranny?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

since i have not driven my bus (or any split for that matter...rode in a bay 
once!) i was wondering what the big deal is over the stock tranny? i have a 
64 completeley stock undergoing a resto right now and i plan on putting a 
1600 dp in it.  i realize pushing a 3000pound vehicle whith a 40 horse is no 
fun but come  on, i dont beleive the structural design of the bus or the 
steering equipment was meant to go 85 -90 mph....especially for those driving 
the unrestored busses (that means mechanically too) sure you could slam and 
mod everything but still its kinda weired...this brings me to my question. 
volkswagen carefully designed the bus with great detail, i plan on using mine 
for daily driver...i will be using stock wheels tires the works. i know i 
wont be a speed racer but how fast (est) will i go? i do sometimes take 
longer trips (4 hours at most) on a highway whats a good cruising speed 50? 
this trips arent taken too often but i would like to know. will the tranny be 
good for daily driver use? thanks in advance---phil
