&gt;&gt;Alright.
Someone needs to go make this deal happen!!!
Supposedly there are 100+ pre-57 VW's located just east of Oakland, CA.
All nice, some GORGEOUS low mileage early rare desirable cars.
Barndoors, splits, kubels, swimmers, you name it, its there.
I can see Mark Merz peeing his pants right now.
