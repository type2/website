was asked...
 
 I've been looking for some WWII trinkets, and someone
 told me that there's a pin that has a little cog with
 a kdf-wagen in front of the cog.  Does anyone have one
 of these?  Does anyone have a picture or point me in
 the right direction?  Just wondering what they look
 like and how much they are going for.  

...

I bought a repro of this pin. It's pretty nice. It's called the &quot;VW Factory 
Cornerstone Ceremony&quot; badge. You can get the repro from Volks Mobilia for 
$13.95. I've bought several of the badges and pins and am quite satisfied with 
them. There is usually an ad in the Vintage Voice. newsletter of the VVWCA.
