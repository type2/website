Dear Volks,

I'm having a spot of trouble with a garage who did some work on my 
bus. I would be extremely grateful for any input from the list on 
whether the work they did was necessary and whether it could have 
had any repercussions. Any advice or comments, or things you think 
sound dodgy, would be greatly appreciated. I have limited 
mechanical knowledge, and was, at the time, relying on the advice of 
a mechanic I did not trust....

I broke down on the motorway some months ago - the symptoms being a 
loss of power, and the clutch pedal not rising from the floor when I 
pressed it. There also felt to be no resistance in the clutch pedal 
when pressed. I was informed by the callout mechanic that the engine 
mounting bolts had dropped out and that the engine was being held in 
place solely by the gearbox. After a brief inspection back at the 
garage, I was informed that my clutch had been destroyed as a result 
and needed rplacing.
I duly picked the bus up, one week later, with 
the new clutch fitted. I noted at the time that the clutch pedal did 
not rise up fully after being depressed (as it had done beforehand). 
I commented on this to the garage but was assured that it was not a 
problem.
On driving home from the garage, I suffered another breakdown with 
identical symptoms and was advised by the callout mechanic (a 
different one than before) to return to the garage I had just left. I 
was towed back to the garage and told that my gearbox (transmission) 
was now destroyed. After soucing a reconditioned 'box and getting 
them to fit it, I assumed that would be the end of it. However, 
several months later I was having the engine replaced at a VW 
specialist when I was informed that the incorrect clutch (a bay 
window clutch and cable) had been fitted. 
I am currently trying to claim back the cost of the incorrect clutch 
and fitting - unfortunately having to resort to using a lawyer to do 
so.
My lawyer has asked me to ascertain the following:

Could the fitting of a bay window clutch damage the gearbox? If so, 
to what extent? 
On the second breakdown, did the gearbox actually fail at all - or 
was it merely the same problem as the first breakdown - the cause of 
which may not have been rectified?
Do the symptoms described for the first breakdown tie in with the 
engine mounting bolts dropping out? Would this result in damage to 
the original clutch, necessitating its replacement?
The garage maintains that it did not replace the clutch cable, yet it 
was apparently the correct length prior to the clutch being replaced 
and too long afterwards (it had been shimmed to try and reduce the 
effective length but was still too long). Why could this be?

Thanks in advance for your time and assistance,

Mack
