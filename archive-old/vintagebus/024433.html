Subject: RE: Eyesore vehicles

Mark,
Dealing with the Nice Neighborhood Nazis is a PITA when you're trying to
build a parts stash. I would like to be able to have a personal VW
boneyard on my property. 'Course, I don't want the neighbor starting a
Chev junkyard next door... that would lower the property values! :)

What I've had to resort to, is keeping most of my projects on an outdoor
storage lot. There is the monthly fee, but it's minimal. Still, it's not
worth it to store a parts car. We had a '63 Bus that I was picking parts
off of that doubled as a playhouse for my 3 year old. The city made me
put down plastic for weed control, pull the wheels, and put it on
railroad ties, but they accepted it as a playhouse. Maybe you could do
the same thing, calling the Bus a greenhouse or storage shed.

If you bring it home, strip it in a hurry, clean up the mess, and ditch
(recycle) the carcass, you're probably okay in most neighborhoods. When
doing this, I try not to run the Sawzall late in the evening, so as not
to piss off the neighbors. I also erected a 6' cedar fence and driveway
gate to minimize the visible impact.

pd
'65 Kombi (project)
'58 questionable Westy (storage)
'73 Westy Weekender
'67 Sunroof Bug
'64 Sunroof Bug (storage)
'68 Ghia (storage)
'87 Volvo (the &quot;nice&quot; car, according to my 2 yr old!)

&gt; I'll throw my self-absorbed hat in the ring too with a question, how do
&gt; you volks deal with local ordinances having to do with old,
&gt; &quot;junker/eyesore&quot; vehicles, especially in multiples? I'd love to get hold
&gt; of parts vehicles to do with as I please but the &quot;Nice Looking
&gt; Neighborhood&quot; Nazis have been at me before, and I don't want to go there
&gt; now.
