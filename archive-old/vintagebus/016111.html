Yeah, I think they went overboard with this whole &quot;ebay motors&quot; thing.
Takes 3 times as long to list an item now, and I don't think this is
the paradigm that auto people work under anyway.  There are other services,
provided by the auto recycling industry, which list parts by 
system category (ie brake, suspension, A/C); due to the inconsistent &quot;inventory&quot;
of ebay, that model doesn't apply well.  In other words, it seems that if
someone is looking for car parts, they look for all the parts for that
type of car, and then drill down.
