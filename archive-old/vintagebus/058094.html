Try Corona Ryan: oebc_at_earthlink_dot_net

He has like-new rebuilt speedos for around $120. Quality is incredible
and he will even match your current mileage for you...

Subject: Re: [VB] Speedometer broke-any spares?


Well, My speedo cable broke yesterday, so today I replaced it, and found
the
speedometer locked up (resulting in the cable breaking).

So anyway, after I tore the speedo apart to try to fix it, I found out
why I
don't do speedometer repair for a living.  I got the odometer fixed, but
the
needle part isn't working anymore (it is now rubbing in the cylinder
thing).
Dang.

So, does anyone here have an extra speedometer for sale so I can keep
tabs
on how fast I'm driving?  Or does anyone know a place that sells
refurbished
ones?

Thanks for any help!
