Subject: Static Timing Light
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's yet another suggestion for a static timing light:

The Datsun Z-cars have a nifty 12v trouble light mounted on the LH side of the engine. It is a bullet-shaped light with an on/off toggle switch on the back. The light is attached by wires about two feet long and can be removed from its holder to allow it to be moved around. The wires tuck neatly back inside the holder. One of these mounted on the top of the Type 2 engine compartment, with one wire permanently grounded and the other outfitted with an alligator clip, could serve double duty as a timing light and a trouble light. It looks kewl, too! You can probably find one in a junkyard for next to nothing. (I wouldn't make a special trip, but if you are in the junkyard and see an old Z-car, snag it!)
