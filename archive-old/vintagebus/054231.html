Matt,

I am 6' 5&quot; also.  I now have a '56 Kombi.  It is not a problem for short 
trips around town.  It is a slight problem over a long trip (over a 1/2 
hour).  In the '56, the shifter is back.  My right leg has a tendency to lean 
on it when crusin' in 4th and I have to concentrate to keep it off.  I solved 
the problem by getting a small wedge shaped piece of foam rubber that I stash 
behind the seat.  When I notice myself doing this, I pull it out, lay it on 
the seat kinda under my thigh, and the leg won't drift over. 

If you get a 60 (or is it 61?) the shifter is moved forward in the cab.  I 
had a 65 bus and a 71 bus when I was younger (and weighed less).  I don't 
remember ever having a problem with either one of them.  Also, there were 
significant changes to the seats over the years and even between models.  The 
56 Kombi has a one position bench seat, like it or lump it.  My 65 was a walk 
through and had separate adjustable seats because the spare tire was not 
behind the seat.  Look around and find one that you are comfortable with.  
Good luck.
