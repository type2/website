&gt;Hey folks.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have leads on who carries the correctly sized 6v battery for a 66
&gt;bus?:)  that fits under the cover, and is held down by the strap?:)
&gt;
&gt;The one's I've been able to find (Advance, autozone) are the larger
&gt;version, that does not fit correctly...
&gt;
&gt;thanks...david

I also have a 66 and just replaced my 6 volt battery with an interstate brand.
It fits under the cover with no modifications and the strap holds the whole
package in place, just like the factory intended.  I don't have the bus in my
driveway today, it is at a friends shop with the transmission out.  I will
check the number this week and post it if anyone is interested.
