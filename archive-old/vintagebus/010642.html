I'm about to attack the wheel on my 66. I'm Planning to use a off white epoxy
puddy i found at a welding shop. I'm going to tint it with some paint colors
i have plow it in
and sand it to shape. Then just 600 and 1200 the wheel and hand rub it out.
If the paint color doesn't mess up the cure of the epoxy it should work.
If any one has a better idea i'd love to hear it :&gt;)
