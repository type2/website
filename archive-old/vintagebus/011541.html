Well, it's not quite so simple!  Of the four bearings in the reduction
box, only two support the wheel.  The other two support the shaft that
comes from the tranny to the box.  Also, the stresses on the bearings
are larger, since the reduction box bearings are fairly close
together, increasing the leverage that sideloads can apply to the
bearings.

So, more isn't always better.

However, in this case, I would be cautious about replacing bearings
designed to hold up the rear end of a bus with bearings made to hold
up the rear end of a bug.  Germans tend to design things to be _just_
strong enough, and going beyond the design limits usually produces bad
results.
