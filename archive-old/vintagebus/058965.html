Subject: Steering box-Help--??

Bessie our 1967 Bus is in need of a steering box--any ideas as to where to
get one. Being a rebuilt I want to be sure its OK--

I had thought that I had already replaced Everything? -- from,
brakes-tires-shocks-wiring harness-motor--tranny--
RGB-,glass,battery,generator-carb-dizzy-locks,bumpers-all the rubber--etc.,
ect., --I guess if its on an Old Bus it will have to be replaced again--
hopefully, TWWM, uj
