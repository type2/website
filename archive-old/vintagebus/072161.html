Subject: Re: [VB] VB Bad Camberg atendees...

I (sglw_at_aol_dot_com  63 singlecab) &amp; Clara claralw_at_aol_dot_com (too many splitties to 
name) will be flying into Brussels on June 18th at 3:35 PM

We leave our independent ways (Clara for London &amp; Sam for San Francisco) on 
the 24th of June at around noon.
We have not rented a car yet &amp; hope to ride with people from BBT to Bad 
Camberg.
Let us all keep in touch, does anyone have plans for renting a cellphone that 
works in Europe?
