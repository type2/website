I know that VW did buield the body of the Splitty with the rear IRS =
Transmission of the Baywindow. They even combined it first with the =
Reduction-Boxes. I think, these buses were build in the 80ies in South =
Africa or in Mexiko or in Brasilia. Does anybody exactly know where they =
were build and what the VW-Part-Numbers of these parts (without the =
Reduction-Bs) are. Greetings from Germany
Arne
