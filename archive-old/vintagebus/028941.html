Subject: $480 Bleeking Dollars!

That's what I was quoted today to powder coat my window frames today for
my '60 double cab
2 - front door sets
    2 frames
    2 bottom channels
    2 wind wing frames
    2 wind wing metal pieces
    4 small pieces of metal channels
2 - pop out window frames

This was with using their &quot;standard&quot; white color.  I spent the weekend
sandblasting the frames down to bare metal and then sanding them with
220 grit giving them what I thought was a nice look.  The guy said he
was going to powder blast them again for &quot;a nice finished look&quot;.

I did not have a heart attack, but a weaker heart might have.

That Eastwood powder coater is looking better all the time.  Now if I
can find an oven large enough to put a bumper in, I'll be ready to go.

Has anyone out there had their frames powder coated and was the price
anywhere near what I was quoted?

Anyone used the eastwood system yet?  Any reports on it?

Thanks,
Scott
