Hi Jack,
Since they are advising using for the most part 90 WT oil and 25% moly grease
which is a good lubricant we think it sounds good.  The steering box does
encounter quite alot of thrust pressure, but fortunitly little in the way of
high RPMs unlike the engine or tranny.  Just make sure you pay more attention
to how it feels and keep track of your steering wheel play for the next year
or so.  That way if there are any signs of trouble you can always change back.
Now as to this &quot;powerpunch&quot; brand if it does not has a GL-4 rating then we
would stay with our &quot;Sta-Lube&quot; brand 85/90WT oil.  This is just our opinion
and if someone else has more info and/or experience on lubricants we would
love to hear from them.   Eric &amp; Barb
