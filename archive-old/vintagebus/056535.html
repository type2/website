Subject: Re: [VB] new aluminum case problems?

&gt; and i was
&gt; wondering if anyone else had heard of these problems or has experienced
them
&gt; first-hand, or any other problems.


i've heard of some different problems through the local VW shop (very
knowledgeable guy). He got some info from another source so he checked the
case he had bought:

1. Distributor drive gear won't install correctly.

2. Dipstick is very hard to install

3. There's some green loctite somewhere in the oil galleys.

His case had all three problems.

Subject: [VB] new aluminum case problems?


&gt;
&gt; hi. i am considering buying one of those new
&gt; aluminum cases in the not-so-distant future. i have spoken to a shop who
has
&gt; assembled a few already and they have told me of two problems, and i was
&gt; wondering if anyone else had heard of these problems or has experienced
them
&gt; first-hand, or any other problems. (by the way, the guy who built the
engines is
&gt; no schlub, and has been building quality engines since he was factory
trained in
&gt; 1963.)
&gt;
&gt; problem 1: the webbing inside the case, on the half
&gt; with the generator pedestal mount (right side), #2 main bearing webbing is
not
&gt; properly machined, thus not allowing the crank to properly turn,
&gt; and when setting end play the crank rubs on this, not allowing proper end
&gt; play setting. this was &quot;remedied&quot; by a simple grinding off of ecxess
&gt; material.
&gt;
&gt; problem 2: the face for the oil pump is machined
&gt; too much (approx .040&quot;--forty thousandths) and when tightening the oil
pump, it
&gt; causes the pump to bind up/crank+cam bind. i didn't get enough info to
find out
&gt; what they did to remedy this, but the builder assured me it was a
modification
&gt; to the oil pump, and not to the case to fix this.
&gt;
&gt; he had also mentioned that one of the cases was not
&gt; bored right (not proper bearing-to-crank clearance--too tight and crank
bound up
&gt; uopn tightening the 6 &quot;big&quot; case half studs), and to fix it, they had to
line
&gt; bore it to 20! this was only one case (so far), but if so far each case
has had
&gt; a problem or more for them, what's the deal?
&gt;
&gt; so, if anyone else has had these problems, i'd like
&gt; to hear about it, or any others. and for those who have bought them, maybe
you
&gt; should check these areas just to be sure.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
&gt; jon
