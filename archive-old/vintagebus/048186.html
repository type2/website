&lt;&lt; So I went out last night to my FLoDS and picked up some glycerin (4 oz 
size,
 undiluted) for about $2.50.  It says to dilute it 3 parts water to 1 part
 glycerin.  What should I put it on with?  Spray bottle, rag, cloth, or pour
 it on and spread it around with a foam brush?  I will be doing my floormats
 this weekend...

I just used a clean rag, applied it straight.   but a tooth brush would 
probably help get the stuff in the nooks and crannies.
