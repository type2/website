Subject: Freeway flier price?

Hey guys,
I just got off the horn with my Dad, and he has decided to sell his =
freeway flier trans, rather than flip the ring gear and use it in his =
bug.  (local speed limit is 55mph, not much need for a flier).  He =
doesn't know what to get for it, and I don't know what to tell him.  I =
do know it was built by Transform, and has about 5 to 6 thousand miles =
on it. =20

Anyone know a fair asking price for it?

Eric
