..... I can adjust when it's cold to hold, then when the engine heats up, it 
no longer holds the idle.  I adjust when its warm to where it holds, then 
when the engine cools down, you get the picture.  Anyway I have been 
adjusting what I thought was the idle air screw (per Muir) little screw 
behind the carb plug.  And now I've got really acrid black smoke coming out 
the exhaust.  VERY Fume-y black smoke, and nothing I do seems to help.  Now, 
it won't hold an idle and I've got this smoke that burns your eyes if your in 
garage.  I have replaced points, condenser, have static timed it as best as I 
could.

what style carb do you have?  Is it single port or dual port?   If the carb 
is square, you usually have 2 screws that adjust, both on the left side.   
You screw the big one in till it starts to cough and die, then screw it out 
three halfs turns.  Repeat withthe tiny screw near it, then back and forth 
till the adjustment doesn't change.  Also, check for vacuum leaks.   Any 
plugs fall off the carb?  if it is a square carb,  is the circle plug towards 
the rear still firmly attached?  What is you climate?  carb icing can make 
the motor stall during the warm up phase, you can watch the ice form on the 
carb and throat of the intake manifold. but that wouldn't cause black smoke, 
which implies runnning very rich. wonder if that top jet fell off the carb.  
or a spark plug wire is not on properly.

I am also thinking this camper may have a beetle engine in it, the engine 
code is &quot;AE 670527&quot;.  Can anyone confirm or deny this engine type is beetle???
===
check the chart in the back of your idiot book.  but you know what, an AE 
case is a good later alloy case with dual oil relief.   and a splitty case is 
the same deal as a bug case, which is why we can still buy engine parts so 
cheap.
