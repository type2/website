Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Valve Gap!

Gene Berg was a legend in his own mind.
He did a LOT for the VW scene, but there are things that he strongly
believed that are just not true (Synthetic oil makes your heads run hot,
chromoly headstuds dont work in daily drivers, 94mm P&amp;C's dont have any
dependability, if the product wasn't supplied by GBE, it wont last
sufficiently, etc, etc......) .  Don't believe everything that he put down
in his writings, take everything with a grain of salt.

But not to sound like i'm bashing Berg, he did a TON of stuff that helped
the VW hobby and I do appreciate that. So no flame wars please.....

really
&gt; knew what he was talking about.
