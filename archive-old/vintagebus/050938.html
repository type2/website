Subject: converting a BMW person/panel van OR fastback wanted

heya...
my good freind jason is a total bmw fanatic....poor soul. i let him drive my 65 (breifly) and he TOTALY dug it! he said he felt the &quot;vibe (hes kinda a new ager) and that he was begining to see the light. however, affter he over-reved my enine i promptly took over and now i HAVE to convert him...he said he thinks fastbacks and panels (and single cabs) are sexy. do you guys think it ok to convert someone from one german car to another? am i makin sennse? any suggestions on how to convince him that vws kick bmw's asses? i took him on the mount shasta trip so he saw the comunity until my throughout bearing gavw out....(it was only his 3rd ride in a splittie bus and i had my SECOND breakdown ever in that bus..totaly giving him the wrong idea!!!) 
also, i need a panel van. i see them all the time at the other vw fanatics houses and it makes me so jealous, panels ar ALL KINDS of sexy. lol. id like a pre 62 ( billet turn signals are sexy) but barndoors are ideal....thanks!
