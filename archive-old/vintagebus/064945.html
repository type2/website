Subject: Re: Berg shifter

Hi Jim,
&gt; I've had a Berg shifter in my '66 delux for
&gt; two years and it still
&gt; works and shifts like new.  I love it.  
Well that's reassuring.
&gt; Also I have
&gt; a question about Aussie
&gt; busses and M codes.  My bus has an M code 002 and I
&gt; think it may mean the
&gt; shroud cooling vanes and thermostat were deleted or
&gt; not added.  It's entry
&gt; into the US was San Francisco and may not have
&gt; needed them in SoCal.  Did
&gt; busses imported into Australia have an 002 M code
&gt; and not have the cooling
&gt; vanes?  Also do you know if having the rear air
&gt; vents moved higher for
&gt; Australia has a specific M code.? 
Mmmm, these are all good questions &amp; I will endeavour
to ask some people in the know the answers.
It's entirely possible this was the case in as far as
the air vents go because it involves an entirely
different side panel.
I'll try &amp; find out.
Incidentally, Deluxes in general are VERY rare in Oz &amp;
you're lucky to have one from here.
Is yours still RHD?
