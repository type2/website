Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 06-25-03

OK, so first things first. I called Ronnie at 
http://www.type2parts_dot_com for a parts order today and he set me 
straight on the truck. It's actually a 1961 Model year truck...made 
in October 1960. So from here on it's back to 1961 Double Cab... 
sorry for the confusion.

I put in an order for some emergency brake cables. The truck is 
missing them completely. Also ordered a speedo cable...this one is 
partially missing. Add to that some hubcap clips and church key and 
the order was done. I'll keep an eye out for it Ronnie. Thanks for 
the kick-ass customer service. Really makes ordering parts nice.

I snuck in an order over at Moon-Eyes for some hot rod goodies as 
well. Should help give the truck the &quot;look&quot;.

When I got home I started work on the broken wiper motor. I yanked it 
and tests revealed it was no good. I opened it up and it's all rusted 
and the little brush spring was broken. I grabbed the 2 spares I had 
for sale on the samba. Luckily they never sold. After fiddling with 
one of 'em for a bit I got it going. I cleaned up the connections and 
installed it back into the truck. I installed my heater switch to 
work double duty as my switch replacement/voltage drop and it worked 
fine. I bolted up all the wiper arms and stuff and installed a couple 
of blades I got with the truck. After a few trial runs I got them set 
good enough and I think they'll pass inspection. Once I pass, they'll 
get yanked off. I hate wipers and we never need them out here. I 
spray a little of that Rain-X or whatever it is on the windows and 
never have needed wipers.

Next I hopped in my wife's '73 THING and went to my buddy's shop. 
He's the guy I bought the truck from. I talked a replacement 
headlight lens for the one I broke and a horn for the one that's 
missing from the truck out of him. He decided to come take a look at 
the truck. He kept telling me &quot;I should have done this myself. 
Damn...I should have just done this myself&quot;. He's right. I told him 
for the last few years that if he just got it running and bolted up 
all the lights he'd sell it. Oh well.

After a few beers he took off and it was getting dark. I bolted up 
the horn and hooked up the hot wire and then grounded the other 
terminal to the body. I went in to the fuse box and touched the horn 
wire to the hot and it honked. I did this because I discovered the 
wire coming through the steering column is cut right at the bottom of 
the steering box. So it's gonna need to be replaced. But at least I 
know the horn works. Tommarrow I can run the new horn wire and hook 
up the button. Then all that's left for inspection is license plate 
light and emergency brake cables.

Me and my buddy thought up a cool idea for bumpers. If it works out, 
I'll post pictures and info. Sure would like to but a Stinger on the 
engine as well...but probably won't at least for now. The little 
engine just runs too good and smooth the way it is.

So it's getting close. More still to come.
