 Checking cooling fan, I reached behind the shroud (motor off!) and
 turned the alternator by hand with the belt off.  My fingers can feel
 about 1/4 of the arc of the turbine to be about 1/8&quot; out of round toward
 the center.  It extends from the outer rim, down the blades to the
 base.  Could this cause a discernable wobble at engine speeds?  Are
 these generally more round?  If it makes a difference, I could feel a
 light layer of dirt caked on it.  While replacing the heater hoses I saw
 some more dirt on the exit points on the shroud.  The alternator tie
 down strap is tight.  Alternator shaft bearings are good.  I have tried
 scooching the alternator back and forth on the stand with no change.  I
 do not think the fan is brushing against the shroud.  The motor itself
 seems to be running smoothly otherwise.
 
 From what I've read, replacing this fan does not look impossible but I
 don't want to replace it on just one of my uneducated hunches.  If not
 the fan itself, any other ideas?

if your fan sits on a piece of glass it should not wobble.  it should be 
round and not warped.  I recently tossed a doghouse fan and also a crank 
pulley as they were warped from fire.   

you could try tightening the big 36hp nut holding the fan to the gen, cause 
if that is coming loose eek but if it is tight and your fan is warped then i 
guess it'll run okay if you can stand the noise but another possibility is 
your generator bearings are bad.
