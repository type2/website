Subject: Re: [VB] do trucks require a different real bumper
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have an odd back bumper on my bus (58) everyone always says &quot;oh, I see you 
have an after market bumper on there&quot; but the thing is, it's the bumper that 
came on the bus.  It's like a step bumper.  Weird, huh?  Our bus was 
delivered in Europe for an American family traveling, then came home with 
them.  Any ideas?
