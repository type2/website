Could it be that the machine screw acts just like the pop rivet?  It
is meant to close the hole in the throttle butterfly.  It isn't going
to act as a weight because the throttle is spring loaded.

&gt;Throttle plate is the lower butterfly valve, controlled by your
&gt;accelerator pedal, isn't it? I've seen some volks running a 009 with
&gt;34PICT drill a little hole in this plate, tap in a small machine
&gt;screw. Maybe it is supposed to weight the throttle plate and 
&gt;encourage
&gt;it to open. I'm not so familiar, I use the earlier design carb. Just
&gt;maybe you don't have the hole of which they speak. Also, I am pretty
&gt;sure the 009 was designed with a heavy foot / wide open throttle in
&gt;mind. Think of that.

&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the advice I received about timing and other issues
&gt;with my .009 and 34pict3 set up. I advanced my timing to about 10 
&gt;BTDC
&gt;at idle and i see a definite inmprovement. However this procedure
&gt;brought up one BIG question.  What\Where is this hole in the throttle
&gt;plate on the carb that I am supposed to plug up.  I have looked my
&gt;carb up and down, and the only pluggable holes I find are the little
&gt;&quot;pipes&quot; where the vacuum hoses would go on a vac set up (already
&gt;plugge with a peice of hose with a screw in the end). So would 
&gt;someone
&gt;very SPECIFICALLY describe where this hole in the throttle plate is
&gt;located??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
