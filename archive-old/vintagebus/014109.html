a few years ago i went to a show at the pleasanton fairgrounds, and there 
was a guy with a panel full of goodies. he had pictures of a junkyard next 
to a pile of tires. there were many busses and parts cars in the photos. any 
one know where this yard is? i seem to think he made mention of concord, but 
its been too long.
