Found stock accessory early bus windshield washer nozzles to go with our

My question:  What is the difference between pre-1964 washer bottles and other washer bottles?  I have a 63 deluxe with the nozzles and hoses but no washer bottle and didn't realize that there were different ones.  How do I tell which one I need?

Thanks,
Richard
