&gt; I doubt they reduce the air intake.  By design they force air into
the engine
&gt; compartment.  They could'nt help but to do that.  This is good
especially if
&gt; you have air leaks in the engine compartment.

Find the open area of one of your intake louvers.  Multiply this by
the number of louvers.  Now find the open area of the scoop.  If the
open area of the scoop is less than that of the louvers then the scoop
will be the restriction in the system.

VWs are built to utilize fan-forced airflow to cool the engine.  The
small amount of ram-air pressure made available by the addition of
scoops won't improve matters much.  One's effort would be better put
to properly sealing the engine bay to prevent recirculation of cooling
air.  It's amazing how cool a properly-sealed VW engine can run!
