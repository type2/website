Hey Robert,
I went through this for the first time this summer.   I'm assuming your
bus has a split-case transmission?  Swapping back and forth may be a
problem.  In mine I had to cut the original front mount out to install a
tunnel case transmission.  The splitcase axles will not work with the
tunnel type transmission, but the small nut 3.88 will go plenty fast if
you get later small nut stuff.  Mine does 70 easy, but it feels good about
67mph indicated using 215/75/15 tires that are larger than original 6.40s.
I stayed with small nut setup as it seemed easier in the short run
and for repairs.  As long as old drums are available.  Ronnie mentioned
that German made ones were going to be available, so I have my hopes up.
I'm happy with the gearing on the smallnut 3.88 using a stock DP 1600
except 1st gear I wish was lower for in the boonies.  Overall I'd
recommend it.  I think a bignut setup 3.88 might push a stock 1600 a 
little hard, but I've never tried it.
