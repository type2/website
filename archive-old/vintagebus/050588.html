&lt;&lt; How does this fit into the equation of the brakes when I change the front 
beam?? &gt;&gt;

Hi Pete,
1. It will raise up your front end about 3&quot; or more if your front end is 
lowered now.  
2.  Will be fine with the front rear brake ratio since the front brakes will 
be far bigger than the much smaller type 3 rear brakes.
  As far as figuring out if you have type 1 or 3 tranny, best to tach it for 
1,500 &amp; 3,000 RPMs in each forward gear to see what you have.  Otherwise it 
is a mystery tranny unless you can accurately trace the history of the tranny 
through each DPO all the way back to the dealership!
