&gt;&lt;&lt; If you want to send me pix of the insides of barndoor cargo doors,
&gt;preferably with the inside panels removed, I can ID these things.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have a set of Barndoor cargo doors on Ebay right now.  See item #299229951
&gt;You can check there to see if they are the same.

Yeah, they look just like the doors you're selling on Ebay at

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewItem&amp;item=299229951

except mine are brand new in primer, but covered with 20 years of attic
dust.  I have two of the doors which take the outside handle - one with a
hole for the handle only and one with two holes, one above the other, just
like your door.


I have only one of the door which takes a handle on the inside only.  Thom
send me a pic of a door he has (Brazilian), and this one I have looks
identical.

I wonder what they're worth?
