&gt; Hello List,
&gt; Can anyone direct me to information on cleaning and polishing deluxe trim.
&gt; Thanks

During the restoration in '94/'95, I used Mothers polish to shine up the
trim to a chrome-like shine. Rubbed it on and polished it out by hand.
Then I wiped them all down with acrylic laquer thinner to get'em cleaner
than clean, went to the paint-room in the resto shop, hung them all up,
and sprayed them with 5 light coats of POR15's Crystal Clear Top Coat
(which goes by another name these days - www.por15_dot_com).

It's 7 years later, and they still look like the day they were shined -
chrome-lustered, smooth, and bright. I recommend this procedure highly,
you may never have to shine them again.

Am I a walking POR commercial, or what?  The stuff worked.
