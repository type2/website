hey youze guys,

I need to re-tourque the heads on a motor and I've heard different things.  One POV is the common sense one that you should do all the bolts, the other is that it's just the ones under the rockers that loosen up.  Any documented correct procedures out there?

My plan is to pull the motor and do them all, but I'm pressed for time and I don't want to open up Pandora's box, so to speak.

Thanks,
Curt
