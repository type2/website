&gt; I have three questions about the What-Not cabinet in my SO-42 Westy (the
&gt; &quot;shelf&quot; that hangs on the rear cargo door).  First, what kind of wood is it
&gt; made out of?  I know the interior panels are made of baltic-birch plywood,
&gt; is the shelf made out of the same thing?  Couldn't find out in the archives
&gt; or library.

Just happened to have mine out and accessible from my 65 project 42.

Made out of birch plywood I think.  FYI here are the dimensions.  There are 4
shelf's counting the top hinge lid compartment shelf.  All structural
components are made out of a birch plywood two or three different thicknesses.

Thickness:

Top shelf        10.10mm  or .395&quot;
2nd                 16.70mm  or .675&quot;
3rd                  10.10mm  or .395&quot;
4th                  10.83mm  or .426&quot;


(As mounted on the door)
Right (front) side vertical piece:     16.59mm or .65

Middle side vertical piece:              16.59mm or .65

Left side vertical piece:                   16.59mm or .65

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Next, can somebody point me to a picture of the back side of the shelf
&gt; (attachment point to the cargo door bracket)?  That part of mine is
&gt; broken/missing.  The PO (a professional woodworker) and I are going to
&gt; attempt to repair my shelf.

I'll try and do that tomorrow and post a link to the pics.  That piece needs
to be beveled slightly (60 degrees or so??) so that it matches the angled
profile of the shelf bracket.  You have the bracket don't you??

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Finally, would there be any interest in reproducing these shelves?  I
&gt; understand that the prices for originals can be rather exorbitant.  As
&gt; mentioned above, the PO is a pro.  I work with him and he is very skilled,
&gt; and has more tools than I thought possible for one man :-)  He loves the
&gt; busses (owns several) and I think he would dig the idea, time permitting.
&gt; Any thoughts on this?  Just mulling it over.
&gt;

There is someone out of San Diego area making these already.   He was at
Pomona (the last dry one) and was trying to (hold your breath) get $250 big
ones.  Yup....$250 dollars for some cut plywood.  I don't think he sold any.
Quality was about a 5 or 6 out of 10.  The back side profile was not that good
and the laminate was WAY off.  If you make these, make sure the profile is
correct as the shelf needs to have a convex shape to it so that it sits on the
door properly.

There was also some yahoo trying to sell one two OCTOs ago asking the same
price...insane AFAIC.
