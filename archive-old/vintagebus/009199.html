&gt; How easy was installing the adjusters ? on the beetle you have to cut the
&gt; upper and lower tubes of the beam and weld the adjusters , you have to
&gt; uninstall the torsion springs also, this was pain , is it the same way
with
&gt; 69 bus beam ??

pull the torsion springs
push aside the spring holding clamp that is inside each tube
drill a 1/2&quot; hole in each of the tubes
cut the material out between the two holes (create a slot)
using a punch and the holes, knock out the peens from the inside out so that
the center holding clamp can rotate
line up the adjuster plate and weld
put everything back

&gt; I have seen on the parts cataloge and the adjusters for 69 bus look like
so
&gt; called &quot;avis adjusters&quot; for beetle , are they installed in a different
way?
&gt; Is there a web page explaning the job , or did U take any pictures of it ?

bus boys has a set of instructions complete with pictures.  They are happy
to fax it to you.  Some of the photos don't make much sense unless you have
the beam right in front of you.
