Hi Oldschool,
There was a set of handles used from 1955-61.  Then in early 62 on through to 
about  Nov64 the handle base, and latches were modified for the slight recess 
in the doors.  Otherwise using the earlier handles on the 1962-early 64 would 
mean the front tips of the handles would touch the door skin chipping the 
paint off.
