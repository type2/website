I am in need of the services of a graphic arts type of person.
I need some artwork done for a logo for the panel.  I have the
design I want, I just need it cleaned up and put into a vector
format so I can get a vinyl transfer cut.  I want to put this
logo on the back hatch of the panel.

Here's the image:

BTW, I got my ACS&amp;R shirts yesterday, and I'm stoked.  It woulda 
been cool if they'd been done in time for KP, but oh well...
