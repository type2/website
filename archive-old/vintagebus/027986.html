Subject: [VB] Junk vehicle rampage across the nation.

Thom,

But what of the doood (ME!!) who chooses a neighborhood where there are
cars up on blocks (4x4's, old chevies), but finds his old bus the cities
target?? Talk about selective enforcement!!!

I still think, if one of my neighbors had a problem with it, they could
have said something or dropped me an anonomous note: God knows I look
the other way when it comes to their pet projects. Hell, my neighbors
(the suspected snitch) shed sits on one foot of my property.

I too, would be interested in the legal precedence.

If my neighbors lawn is neatly manicured an an unatural smooth green
through the use of chemical fertilizers and herbicides and pesticides,
am I expected to have a lawn &quot;no worse&quot; than his??!!! Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder and I prefer a meadow to contaminated ground water.

Les
