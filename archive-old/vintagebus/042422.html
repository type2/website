Okay someone had to say it:

the grateful dead (preferably anything live)

One of my best bus moments was when the tape sang &quot;ran into a rainstorm&quot;
and i did just that exactly when the tape said so... funky.

Phish
Leftover Salmon (polyethnic cajun slamgrass is the genre according to
band lit.)

also, i find jazz to be great for bus driving.  Some notables from my
library are miles davis, John Coltrane, MMW.

take care,

Steve
