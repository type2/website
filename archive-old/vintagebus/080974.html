&gt;&gt; When I push and pull on it there is about 5 millimeters worth of play.  Is 
that normal or should I go through more of a engine rebuild than just a 
flywheel replacement? &lt;&lt;
Hi Kurt,
5 millimeters is about .200&quot; and the VW limits for the end play is .003&quot; to 
.008&quot;.  No amount of shimming to get even near the proper end play is going to 
work without causing the crank to lock up.  BTDT with only .080&quot; end play.  
Time for a complete engine rebuild and we have our doubts the engine case is 
going to be usable.
