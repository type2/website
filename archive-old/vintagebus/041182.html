If you look at the bottom of the fan shroud where the shroud meets the head
tin(under the ignition wires).There should be two 10 mm bolts one each side
of the engine,though some people use the cheesehead screws.If those are in
place then you should have the flaps in place. also you could reach around
the fan shroud and feel for the flat rod that connects the flaps together.If
this is there then you definetely have the flaps in your shroud. If you want
to check for the thermostat.Peer under the pass. side of the engine
beneath the push rod tubes.There you will see the thermostat.It's a round
accordian
cylinder attached to the engine case via a rectangular bracket.

&gt; Is it possible to determine with the engine in, if I have a
&gt; thermostat/bracket and flaps in my doghouse shroud? I peered from the back
&gt; under the pass side 1 2 head and saw nothing. I am assuming it's not
there,
&gt; but what about the flaps? Any way to spot that? I know that R and r is
&gt; bascially in order to replace these if missing (flaps), but first to tell
if
&gt; I have them, next to acquire if I don't.
