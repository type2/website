Man, and don't you live back east? When I lived in Florida, I never had to 
worry about my bus at all. Paint your caps grey, maybe they like the chrome?

&lt;&lt; I am now on my 3rd set of caps in less than a year!!!  Does anyone else 
have
 problems with parts walking away from your bus?  Is there a way to lock caps
 down?  Im ready to start sleeping with a shotgun in the back.  Just last
 week I found my &quot;64Type2&quot; vanity plate with one screw out and the other
 halfway out.  It is now taped inside my back window.  I think its time for
 an alarm, a 12volt conversion, and video surveilance.   ARRRGH &gt;&gt;
