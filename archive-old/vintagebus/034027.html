Subject: Re:  [VB] 62 brake upgrade
To: bryanrmitchell_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What is a good way to upgrade the brakes on a 62
single cab? I want to keep it somewhat simple without
going wild and adding dask brakes. 
 Thanks----Bryan

how is the condition of your system now.   ?  One thing I have found is that 
if you inspect all your wheels, use rough sandpaper on any glazed drums of 
shoes.  (yes really, it makes a difference), and  replace you old brake hoses 
it will improve you stopping power,  There is a lot of differenc between tip 
top and well it works.

If the 62 brakes just are not enough for you in anycase, you can do a mre 
major mod, which in volves swapping the front beam for the 64-67 kind.   Or 
if you can find them, use a pair of the 63 M 215 spindles that use the 63 and 
earlier kingpins, and so will fit a 62 beam, yet use the 64-67 brakes

And swapp over  to the the big nut boxes on the back (higher gearing too)
