Subject: shift fix~not free!
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

If you don't have the luxury of a free fix like Ellis
here is a easy cheap way that will only take about 15
mins. to fix and no pulling the eng. and trans...

Not meaning in any way to slam my friend JHoward, let
me reinforce that the recent fix to my tranny was not
free! Labor and parts were paid for on the initial
visit to the mechanic. Boy was it! I provided the
freshly rebuilt $60. nose cone. Then I paid the going
labor rate to have someone else throw the wrench. What
*was* free was the opportunity for the mechanic to do
it right as it should have been on the first visit.
There was no shifting problem prior to the visit.
Leaking and wornout nosecone seal was my original
tranny problem. If I wasnt fighting the flu, working
60 hours, wife having a baby and not have thrown my
back out I would have completed the dirty deed myself
as I generally do. I mentioned in my last up date that
there are several possible work arounds but the
internal misalignment between the hockey stick and the
selector fingers will result in excessive premature
wear and will eventually provide one more opportunity
to pull and fix the tranny and then do the fix plus
replace more parts. I prefered to bite the bullet and
get my chit right the first time. Actually the leaks
etc resulted from me not doing it (tranny install)
thoroughly and completely correct the first time
around. The person who originally helped with the
tranny install and short block rebuild &lt;in one
weekend&gt; busted is *ss over a  weekend so I could make
it to work on the following day. His work was great. I
just provided incomplete parts to get it nailed right
at that time. Sincere thanks to Kyle T and family for
all of the help.
God bless those who can clooge their pieces together
with cut and welding. There is no free lunch. Pay now
or pay later. There is a lot that can be said
regarding  being able to do a complete resto to all
systems with no deadline prior to driving vs. clooging
as you go along and having to depend on the bus
immediately for a daily driver. I have done both.
Resto for the wife and clooging for my daily. In the
longrun I'll bet that I have more time and effort into
my clooged bus. distance between the two budgets seems
to be getting smaller with each fix. The RFH has been
nearly trouble free... The rat'63 has been a constant
PITA.
