Subject: Life Mag VW Bus Ad List
To: vintagebus_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com

As alluded to a couple of weeks ago,
here is a list of Life magazine advertisments
for VW busses.  Thanks to Ted Kulesa who
did the reasearch to put together this list.
I am merely a scribe, and have not double
checked any of these.  I keep a hard copy 
in my wallet.

I got of bunch of requests for this list, but had
to wait for Friday to make a public post (and
to find time to re-type the list).

Look magazine also has VW ads.  Personally
I won't cut up any magazines I find, as the ads
are even better in the proper context, along 
with other vehicles of the same era ads.
This list does NOT contain ads for other VW's,
such as bugs or Type3's, so you may have
to paw through the mag anyway, which is fun.

But if you must cut them up, keep the ads for
other cars of the period.  Not only do some of
them have similar collector interest as VW's
some are downright hillarious seen through the
filter of time, like the one for a Ford Cortina.  
Some are just great, like the one for Pontiac 
Firebird, showing about 9 different models
