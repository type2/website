Subject: [VB] Re: Wal-mart bus 

Just got back from Walmart with my boys new Christmas present. I am
totally blown away. I want to really express my appreciation for the
heads up on this one. I paid $13.61 with tax here in Maryland.

But somebody said the bug is a flat windshield super beetle. maybe yours
is, but mine is definitely a regular beetle. To be more precise, it is a
1972. It has the oblong late model taillights (before they went to those
stupid round taillights in 1973) and the decklid has four sets of vents.
But to be even more precise, it has a 1973 or later front end on  it.
Before you come to the conclusion that I am some sort of vw minutiae
nazi, let me explain that the beetle on the back of that trailer is my
old beetle!! He he. Some idiot drove into the front end and the body
shop repaired it with a 1973 hood because the trim was a few dollars
cheaper. It lacks the vw logo on the top portion of the hood.

So there you have it. As if anybody gives a rats behind.
