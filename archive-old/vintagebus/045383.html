&lt;&lt;  I suspect that while, in theory, the larger rear brakes will through the
system out of balance, in practice it makes little real difference.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
The thing to keep in mind is that VW since the very early 1950s (Previously
the shoes were the same width.) has made thier ACVW with the bigger stonger
brakes in the front.  This way if you panic brake your VW the fronts are going
to lock first.  While the rears being less strong are more likely to let the
rear wheels keep turning thus slowing the VW and thusly keep the VW pointed in
the right direction.  This is doublely important on wet or icey pavement.  If
the rears are made bigger and stronger than the front then you have more
possibilities of having the VW do a 180 degree spin when panic stopping.  
We know this seems to be not a high possibility, but we have seen a simular
problem with front wheel drive cars.  Due to the wieght of both the engine and
tranny are up front in these cars there is very little wieght in the rear.
During panic stops with these vehicles the light rear end lifts upward and
then the entire car does the same 180 degree spin.  This happened to my mother
with her Scirroco front wheel drive VW twice on perfectly dry 70F days and she
found herself sitting in the median suddenly facing the wrong way even though
she had rather new tires.  Plus we had to slow down for a traffic jam a year
ago and the driver behind us noticed the slow down a little too late on the
wet pavement.  He hit his brakes and spun 180 degrees around and ended parking
parallel to on the shoulder beside us looking very surprised in his front
wheel drive car.  Due to the ACVW having more of it's wieght on the rear axles
there is far less possibility of the lifting of the rear end to the point of
losing the traction of the rear wheels.   Eric &amp; Barb
