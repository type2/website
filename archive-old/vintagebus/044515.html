Just got back to California last night at 2100 hr. local time. Left Frankfurt 
on the 0345 plane (ca time) so it has been a long day.

The meet was fantastic and I have about 100 PICS of early buses to download 
&gt;from the digital camera.

The most amazing bus in my mind was the orange 67 double sliding door bus 
with 27,000 km original miles. It used to be a luggage transfer bus at the 
Zurich airport. It has been lowered for driving on the British motorways so 
some purist will be offended.

The radar bus with an opening door in the front on the passenger's side was 
amazing, it has two generators and 3 batteries!
The supercharged barndoor van was neat as was a bunch of stuff.

I will post a webpage this weekend. I now have to get on a plane to Los 
Angeles for a two day meeting, hope I stay awake.

My only real cool purchases were two treasure chest door lock with keys (NOS) 
for $24.00 each or DM 40. There was a mad hunt for locking steering column 
locks but I did not try. I will search when my 63 singlecab is really worth 
stealing.

Bought 63 front side light lenses and a bunch of singlecab toys.

If anyone wants treasure chest door locks for a singlecab, let me know.
