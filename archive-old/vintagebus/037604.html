Hi Woody,
We have been dealing with waterproofing our SC cab truck tilt.  We had bought 
several gallons of the waxy proofer before we had heard about the silicon 
type waterproofer.  While the wax type sealer works it makes the material 
heavier and a little waxy sticky feeling.  The silicon type would not do 
this, though you would be best off making sure not to get any of this sealant 
on your VW.  Just using a silicon based wax causes all types of problems 
later when you want to do any painting of your VW and is rather a pain to 
properly remove!   Eric&amp;Barb
