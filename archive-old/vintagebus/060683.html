&gt; Y'all,
&gt; 
&gt; I just posted the pictures from the Bug-in at Portland International 
&gt; Raceway this weekend.  All the pictures I posted are of Buses save one.  
&gt; There was a really nice bug there with all the trimmings that anyone who is 
&gt; a VW fan might enjoy.
&gt; 
&gt; Check em out:  http://community.webshots_dot_com/user/tempor4
&gt; Choose the Bug-in folder.

Wow - that bug has a ton of accessories!! What is curious, though, is the bus 
that appears to be a Kombi with the Deluxe roof . . . What do you know 'bout 
that?
