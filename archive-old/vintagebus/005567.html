Subject: Sealing around oil cooler

My plan is to pull the engine from the 71 and stick in the 69.

I am half way there. The 69 is engineless. :-(

Anyway I need some input on the doghouse setup. When I get the engine out I
suspect the cooling tin will be in disarray as it was running somewhat hot
when last run. I understand I need some sort of foam gasket around the side
on the oil cooler which I suspect is gone. We will see. I also bought a
Hoover bit that I had rewelded  is there anything else needed there?

Long story short: I have one day to do this and want to have everything on
hand w/o a 70 mile round trip to the VW flaps in the middle of the project.
