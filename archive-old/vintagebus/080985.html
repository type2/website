Subject: Re: [VB] shift knobs

wow!!!!  

Guy I know drove a bus around for years with an old cut glass doorknob as 
shift knob.  never heard of that.   Another guy, friend who moved to New Mexico 
also had a cut glass shift knob... never heard of that.   Must have been a 
funny angle or somthing.  
 I think they look neat.

npleasant suprise, in the form of a hole/burn in the middle of his newly 
upholstered seat! The sun
was being focused right in the middle of the seat by the glass knob, like a 
magnifying glass!
