&gt; My number 1 spark plug blew out last night and now it wont screw in it just
&gt; slides in and out and doesnt bit any threads. Any clue what to do here and
&gt; how it happened? Oh yea its a 74 bus with a 2000 in it.

Hi Ian,
Either the threads were just worn out or cross treaded at one time or another 
or the head got too hot and softened the aluminum.  Try Time-Sert for solid 
insert kit.
