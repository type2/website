&gt; However, when they switched from full bench to 1/3 2/3 bench they did make

Hi Clara,
Good to hear!  If the 205 is just a bit tight then a Cooper 195 would 
probably fit in fine.  The best way to figure out this problem with all the bus sized 
modern radials is to buy two or four radials for your bus and try one in the 
spare position to see if will fit or how much thinner you need to go.  Also 
one can try deflating the spare for a tad more narrowed storage, but one then 
must carry a working tire pump to fill it.  We have done this in the past for 
our radial 165SR15 spare in the 1963 KG.  This can be a problem if you drive 
often in city areas where having your VW broken down for more than a few minutes 
you get towed off.
