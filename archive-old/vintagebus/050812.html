&gt; Will the mod will work for a Single cab just as well?

Hi Elliot,
Yes, it is even easier installation than for the standard bus!  We have done 
this to our 63 SC and really appreciate the longer range.  Do consider 
installing a reserve switch even if you alway leave it on reserve and never 
install a reserve cable it really is nice to be able to slide underneath and 
hand shut off the fuel.  This really helps when removing the engine, 
replacing the flex fuel lines forward of the engine or if you want to park 
your VW and stymie any thieves by only giving them about a maximum of two 
minutes of fuel from the carb float bowl.    Eric&amp;Barb
