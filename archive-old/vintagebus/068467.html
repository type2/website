Subject: stuck drums, stuck steering wheels etc.

Craig makes an excellent point here. There are varying degrees of stuck. I 
have removed many steering wheels using a multitude of methods, but was 
totally unprepared for one last summer. After a month of pounding, oiling, 
heating, sweating and cursing I had to give up. I was telling a friend about 
my woes when he went out to garage and from a dusty recess pulled a vintage 
german steering wheel puller that he had bought from a retired mechanic in 
the early seventies. It worked. It was easy. I offered him a hundred bucks 
for it. He turned me down. I can't wait for the next really stuck steering 
wheel. I want to borrow it again. Unfortunately he did not have an old 
school drum puller. I have fabbed one from an old drum and some flat iron 
but it probably would pale in comparision to the correct one from days of 
old.  Keep on beating, oiling, drilling, cursing and crying.  There is truly 
nothing like the high of success over a worthy opponent.
