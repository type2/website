Howdy all,

I recently bought an &quot;in-the-box&quot; NOS accessory steering column lock for an
early Type 1.  With the recent discussion about steering locks, I realized
that the only thing missing from my lock set was any kind of installation
or instruction sheet.  Does anybody out there have in their literature or
parts collections, the instruction sheet(s) from either (or both!!!) the
Type 2 or Type 1 accessory steering column lock.  If so, could I get you to
make a nice photocopy of what you have and send it along to me so I'll know
how to install this particular set on my '57 Cabriolet.  I'll also be
hunting this season for one for my '59 Double Cab, so both Types of
instructions would be very helpful.  I'd be delighted to reimburse your
expenses.  Please e-mail me personally if you can help me out.  Thanks for
looking!

By the way, my '59 Double Cab (down in Dallas, TX undergoing the body work
portion of her restoration) didn't have any box speaker above the back
window.  I have never seen anything like that installed by the factory on
any Bus I've ever seen at a show, in literature or in accessory or parts
books that I have.  So my guess is that the person who inquired about that
has a nicely installed aftermarket speaker box, not a factory installed, or
VW provided accessory item.

It's almost 70 degrees here in St. Louis today, I think I'll take the Bus
out of winter storage and go for a spin!  Any Dallas, TX listees listening?
 I'll be down there this coming weekend for three days to work on the '59. 
Wanna come over to visit/play?
