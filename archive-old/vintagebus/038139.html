&lt;&lt;  I noticed that after about 30 min in trafic that at a signal, my oil 
pressure dropped to about 7-8 psi and the light flickered.  RPM's had dropped 
to about 800 at that time.  By getting the idle back up to about 1000, the 
light went out and pressure came up to a bit over 10psi.&gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
If this is a SR that sounds about right, if it is a DR that sounds bad.

&lt;&lt; I had been driving at between 35 and 45 on city streets for about 12-15 
miles.  That 35-40mph is a bear as RPM's in 3rd are up around 3250 but down 
around 2200 in 4th, hard to determine which is better for the engine. &gt;&gt;
In our experience it is best for cooling to stay around 2,500-2,800 RPM.  So 
in other words just go a little slower than the speed limit in third.  Plus 
not leaving a 100 mile radius until you have a chance to work over the 
engine.   Eric&amp;Barb
