&gt;
&gt;Since we seem to have a thread going for heaters once again... I have been
&gt;tinkering with an electrical schematic for an early (up to August 1969)
&gt;heater and &quot;colorizing&quot; the wires and cleaning it up to my liking since, as
&gt;Thom so aptly put earlier, it is quiet.  This drawing has a second 
&gt;schematic
&gt;on the same page for a post August 1969 BN4 heater.  I pulled it down from
&gt;&quot;http://w1.111.telia_dot_com/~111-7929/BN4_schema_en.gif&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The question, I guess, is whether someone wants this ?  Rick?  Thom, you
&gt;have a spot for it?  I also have a cleaned up cross section drawing of a 
&gt;BN4
&gt;I have been puttering with off and on that I can push out to someone or a
&gt;central location (preferable I would think).  Perhaps on the documentation
&gt;project somewhere?  Both of these drawings have been preset to 11x17 size 
&gt;if
&gt;anyone is curious about that.
