I would consider having a East Coast sending off party
and would also participate as a driver if need be.
(Annapolis, Md)  In the fall we could have a big
oyster roast and I can park 25-30 busses in my back
yard.  Might have a party anyways, but this would be
way cool.  Sounds like a very cool idea.  H. Steve
lives right down the road, start of  the east coast
leg, how about Tom starting the west coast leg?  Also
all those vans could camp in the back, but you would
have to be able to throw frisbees to Hagerty the black
lab.  Just kidding.

Cheers,
Flynn
