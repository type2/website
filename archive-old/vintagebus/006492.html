Subject: more input shaft slop...

    The transmission input shaft is going to have some slop anyways because
of the way it is designed...
    The input shaft is not supported at the bore where it exits the
transmission case. It is supported at that end only when the engine is in,
by the needle bearings inside the gland nut.
    A gland nut that has worn out needle bearings will thrash the seal that
seals the input shaft... preventive measures include replacing the gland nut
every time a rebuild is done, as well as the input shaft seal. It's not
expensive to do.
    If you can see the circlip from the bellhousing... this is not good.
Your seal is either gone or well-mangled.
    The shaft is actually held in place by the combination of the circlip, a
splined collar, and a threaded stud. The stud holds the centers of the
shafts together front to rear. The shafts are splined on the outside just as
the collar is splined on the inside. Once the collar is slid over the
junction, then you can transmit torque to your tranny... and the splines
keep the shafts from turning at different speeds thus backing away from the
stud. The circlip holds the collar in place... The outer edge of the collar
is instrumental in backing your bus up, but that's another post...
    circlip... if this breaks loose, so can all hell... depending on the
circumstances. say... if you were in the fast lane during rush hour. r &amp; r
it with the right tools.
    popping out of gears... this could be the fault of the detent system,
but not necessarily. Other worn parts can also cause this. Sometimes you can
do the bungee cord thing and it works just fine. Yippee... sound like a
detent issue.
    If the bungee does not work, it could be other things... a worn
synchronizer assembly for one. This is not just the &quot;synchronizer stop
rings&quot; or &quot;synchros&quot; as most people call them... those are just part of one
assembly. Badly worn teeth don't want to stay engaged... and the thrust
generated will eventually overcome the resistance of even the stoutest
detent ball/spring versus recess in the shift rail. ...leastaways that's
what they tell me at the school ;)
    I'll be able to tell you more after the '70 westy tranny in my garage
gets taken apart... it absolutely did *not* want me to downshift at any rpm
above 1000 (even with double clutching) and violently forced the gearshift
back into neutral.

thanks for tolerating the slop... ;)
