&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Are you wanting to paint anyway?  its kinda a PITA
and you can't drive while it is taken apart.  There
are half a billion pieces for a deluxe, and more
bodywork to do,    so why not drive it and slowly
collect the pieces as you get the bus sorted and all
to little things nice (like matching keys, working 
interior lights and find a door handle to replace
&gt; the one on the cargo doo that is broken off) &quot;&quot;&quot;

I know I may be getting ahead of myself with the color
choice. I plan to get the mech's working and drive it
for a year or so and collect the parts, BUT when I
climb into the bus in my back yard, slide back the
sunroof framework (the baked cover was ripped to
shreds flapping it's way on a flatbed form Wyoming to
Cali) ease back into the exposed coils of the middle
seat and make that P-B-B-B-B-B-T motor sound with my
mouth, knowing the eventual color will help me
visualise the thing all done-up.

YO!
