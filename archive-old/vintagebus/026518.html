All,

Thank you for all of the positive responses and support, especially the phone
calls.  I just felt it was the right time to give an update now.  I hoped to
send one earlier but wanted to have some real info before I did.  First of all,
all products will be shipped that have been ordered and no new orders are being
taken until those orders are done.  Many things have happened recently that
have hampered production here at PLF.  In an attempt to keep business and personal
life separate these things were not always mentioned in the beginning.  At this
point in time it has become necessary to explain these occurances in an effort
to explain the delays and the way they were handled.  Mark Hindline was the
closest to 'hitting the nail on the head' with his comments.  There has been
no attempt to abscond with customer money, just unpredicted factors that have
piled up to create a situation where production was not the top priorioty. 
Attempts have been made to refund money when requested, but without funds coming
in and with all money from order payments put toward materials this is not always
timely.  Some money has been borrowed to make some refunds, but I cannot borrow
enoght to cover all orders.  I am working to get orders out and hope to get
all orders with a normal production time out by the end of January.  Canopies
and products with longer production times (as stated in the catalog) will be
completed soon after.  

As has been stated in the numerous threads over the last week, in the last couple
months I have relocated, gone through a divorce and related issues, and had
some billing mistakes made by a supplier, slowing the ordering process.  New
suppliers also needed to be located in the new area.  While this was going on
my son broke his hand.  This required surgery and a week in the hospital and
the paperwork afterward has taken until the wee hours of the night every day
to complete.  Things are starting to settle down now (I hope!) and production
should continue soon.  I will attempt to do a better job communicating in the
future, but with all of the issues the last thing on my mind was checking my
e-mail, and the fact that some of the mail recived was extreamly hateful did
not help my enthusiam.  

Buses and the volkswagen community are my life.  I live and breath volkswagens
and every part of my life is entwined in volkwagens in one way or another. 
I value the friends and customers I meet at shows and on the list and enjoy
being able to share my craft to help in their restorations.  I chose to make
volkswagens my livelyhood not for the money, but so I could help my fellow volkswagen
owners while supporting my family in a way that allowed me to spend time with
my 3 year old son.  I have enjoyed this business over the last three years and
hope to continue long into the future.  I realy appreaciate all of the positive
messages and words of encouragement, they help more than you may know, and hope
to have all of those with not so positive comments appeased by whatever means
necessary in the near future.  I don't plan to fade away, but rather let this
experience be a learning experience and help to make my business a better business
in the future.  I started out as a craftsperson but with a little help from
my friends on the list can become a better businesswoman because of this.

Thankyou
Dawn Smyth
