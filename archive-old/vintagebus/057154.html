Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] Why VWoA protects its darn logo so fiercely

Guess what?  Audi is doing the same thing VWOA is, it's just they don't
have air-cooled hobbyists to chase after.

If you *really* wanna put your money where your mouth is, buy a Japanese
or (*shudder*) American car.

&gt; peer to the Passat price).  Now, I know that the companies are closely
&gt; linked, and I can't help that they're connected.  But it's not that I'm
&gt; boycotting VW.  But if I go with Audi, I don't have to hear the name
&gt; VWofA, or see it on the subsequent mailing you get when you've purchased
&gt; a new car.  The bad taste in my mouth from this whole thing lost them a
&gt; formerly loyal NEW VW buyer, strictly because of THEIR image.  I'm just
&gt; one person, but how many will it take?
