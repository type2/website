&lt;&lt; Hi Stephen and list,
 I've been following all the different posts on gas mileage for split screen 
 busses on the list for a few years and have come to this conclusion. Busses 
 will not get 28mpg or more. I think people that do have their speedo off. I 
 finally have my motor dialed in, and on the freeway I get around 22-23mpg. 
 Around town I get 16-17. I know it could be better around town but that's 
 what I get. The motor is a stock 1600DP with a 34PICT-3 and a 009 dizzy. I 
 plan to swap dizzy's out for a stock dual vac. advance which should also 
 increase the mpg. The tranny is stock and doesn't have a freeway flyer. Not 
 too sure how much increase in mgp a diff. tranny would have though. I drive 
 55-60 on the freeway.
 Please let me know if you have come to any other conclusion.
 Good luck,
 Dave Barnes

my first split, a early 59  with split case tranny and 1500 H case sp motor  
lower compression on #3 (120, 120, 105, 120), 28 pict carb, 009, always got 
31 MPG.   Even if my speedo/odo was off, on various trips I took, cross 
country/ up and down the Pacific coast, it was very cheap to drive. 

Since then I have never acheieved that 31mpg bliss.

My 65 westy gets lesser milage.  On my spring trip to AZ and back, I drove 
somewhat over 4K miles, and the milage averaged out to 23.3 or so.   better 
on freeway than around town.  Better on flats than ups and downs.   better 
when I drove 50-55 than when I drove 60-65.  My highest milage run was 29mpg 
driving to Tucson from Phoenix, in a slow bus caravan.   I consistantly get 
over 20mpg. Seems pretty normal.

the 59 truck I had averaged 28mpg.   small nut . low geared (4.37r&amp;p by the 
tach reading we figured).  It would whine if I drove 60, so I never went that 
fast, stayed under 55 on thefreeway, which I avoided generally, except for 
driving it home.  It also had a bay 15 gal tank.  Drove it from the bay area 
(where I got it) to oly WA, a bit over 800 miles, and it really took very 
little gas.  I  filled up when I left , and once in southern Oregon for gas, 
and even though the truck could drive straight 450 miles, I had to stop more 
often than that, so rest areas it was.   40hp motor.   Cheep cheep.

dunno why.  wish I did.   maybe it is small motors.  dunno.
