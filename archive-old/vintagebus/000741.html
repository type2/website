Subject: [VB] generator light on!
Message-ID: &lt;0.dc423575.2599e116_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi:
    Will low battery voltage make my generator light on?  My pulley broke on 
the freeway last night.  After I replaced it I found that the generator light 
didn't come off.  Can anybody help me out?  Thanks.
Michael
