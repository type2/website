Subject: high hinge covers and sisal carpet !
Date: Mon, 1 May 2000 11:03:37 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey all,
    Can someone please tell me if high hinge cargo doors all came with hinge
covers?
Or did only the front door come with covers ? or if this was an option ?
My '60 so23 Westy only has covers on the front door hinges.
I am finally starting reassembly, a year after painting!
So many buses so little time.I have been accumilating hard to find parts.I
now believe I have everything to finish the restoration.
Also, for all who are looking for sisal carpet.Pier1 imports NOW has sisal
carpets in &quot;grey&quot; that match the originals VERY WELL! I know Robert Davis
has been looking !You will have to rebind the edges, after cutting to fit !!
                                            woody

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;
