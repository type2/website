Hi all,

I believe that it was E &amp; B who brought up the issue of Wire wheeling
rust.  I have a 4&quot; inch grinder with a 5/8 shaft.  I think that's the
combination.  All of the wire wheels that I have found have a 1/2 inch
hole for a grinder and won't fit (I tried).  Am I missing something?
I've checked the hardware stores, I've checked Harbor Frieght and a
couple other mail order places with no luck.

Thanks,
Aaron
