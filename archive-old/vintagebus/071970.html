&gt; At least according to Bentley, '65 is one year only and '66 is one
&gt;   year only.  The '67 motor may have lasted into the bay-window Buses,
&gt;   but I don't have a bay parts list.  A couple of catalogs suggest that
&gt;   '68-'72 Buses took a 211 955 113 H motor, and then the 211 955 113 Q
&gt;   was used again from '73-'79.
&gt; 

I obtained a 68 bay wiper motor to try it in my 67 bus they are not the same, 
the mounts are a different spacing and the bay one is also longer. But I was 
able to use the brushes.
