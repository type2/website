Here's mine, in order of acquisition:

1967 Westy in running condition when I got her (Mathilde) last spring.
She's sportin' a 1600 sp balanced engine with less than 10-15 miles, that
leaks oil cuz the guy who built it didn't use any case sealer, and a
precision tranny built by Long Enterprises in Sebastopol with rebuilt redux
boxes...same mileage as engine.  Mathilde is in pieces now...awaiting
resto.....

1966 Westy in freshly painted condition...in fact, I just painted the
interior yesterday...This bus is named Clara &quot;Nugget&quot;, as she was once owned
and worked on by Clara Williams, who left maintenance notes....and called
what was then a root-beer brown beater bus &quot;Nugget&quot;  Rescued from a junkyard
in WA.  www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Progress1.htm (sorry, I don't have pics of
the painted interior up yet)

1960 Doublecab (Bartholomew) in PPG DP40 primer with rust streaks.  He's my
daily driver, and is scheduled for resto this spring after Clara is done.
Got him from a VW mechanic in Santa Barbara, and I've driven nothing else
since.  On the weekend of February 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, I took him to Shasta
on backroads with a couple other bus nuts...you'll be seeing the overblown
&quot;trip report&quot; URL soon!  Here's Bartholomew's page:
www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Bartholomew.htm

And in loving memory, my first Bus (Gus), named by the hippies who lent him
to me for a year and a half...an oxidized red 1962 17?-window Deluxe, with
collapsed front suspension, an engine that wouldn't quit, and the ability to
carry 9 -12 drunken people while being piloted by an acid-freak (I'm not
admitting anything here, right?).  Gus met a most heinous and untimely end
when, after returning him to his owner, who lent him to another guy, who
left him at the bottom of Covey Hill in Forestville when his brakes
died....and there was this dump truck that had dying brakes also....
