I'm amazed at the amount of support for the list purchase/raffle of
RVB's bus.  My idea was in jest, something we were kicking around at
the OCTO show while we were watching the various BusMongers dis it.

Jim wants to sell the bus in a more conventional manner, and I
respect that.  A raffle/list bus drive would only muck stuff up for him.

Thanks for the support, and let's stand by and see what happens with
this beastie.

Thanks!

Thom
