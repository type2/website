At 55 you are not loading the engine as highly as at 65. Wind
resistance goes up with, I believe, by the cube of the speed.  That
means your primary drag (wind resistance) has increased by 1.65 times
from 55 to 65 mph. That is a large increase in engine load. That is
why you don't overheat at 55 and do at 65.

&gt; I'll chime in on this from the &quot;lowered&quot; perspective.  When we
lowered my
&gt; bus with the Wolfgang kit and switched to a 68 type 1 trans, I also
setup a
&gt; doghouse shroud with new cooler and thicker fan to replace the
non-doghouse
&gt; shroud running a remote cooler.  The motor is 1600 sp with kadrons,
009,
&gt; compufire, and single qp.  On both drives to Kelley Park and Sac
Bugorama,
&gt; my Berg temp dipstick would turn the light on if I sustained speeds
of 65mph
&gt; or faster.  If I slowed down to 55 and stayed there, the light would
go out
&gt; and stay out.  But driving 55 seems to defeat the purpose of going
the type1
&gt; route for lower Rs on the highway.  It has also crossed my mind that
perhaps
&gt; the Rs are too low thereby not turning the fan fast enough at given
freeway
&gt; speeds but then why would slowing down cool it down.  I've backed
the timing
&gt; off some with no difference but want to fiddle with it some more as
well as
&gt; check the air/fuel mix.  I'm interested to find out if it's the phat
motor
&gt; that makes the difference too.
