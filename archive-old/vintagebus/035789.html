Hello all. I asked a while back about how to make a contraption to rip the

rear end out of my bus and still be movable, I got some good ideas too.

Thanks to everyone. Anyway, would it be possible to take an old pair of

reduction boxes and cut the axle tubes off so that all you have is the box

itself. Then take the lower inner and outer bearings and the stub axle, put

all of this together and bolt it to the spring plate. Then I would ned to

put the drum back on with out the brake parts and the wheels and tires.

Would this setup be strong enough to hold the whole bus up? Does the axle

tube provide any stability to the rear end, or is it all supported by the

lower bearings? Anybody got some insight? Thanks.

 If the spring plates aren't held from moving side to sode, they might do
that.  You would want a brace if you were going to use that method.

it seems sturdier to mount something to the frame horns- where the two big
nuts holding the main tranny section in.    
heard someone says about one like this w one big castor wheel- you could slide
it around fairly easily.  Hey, I want one!
