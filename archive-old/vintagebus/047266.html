Subject: Plans wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was wondering if anyone has a Foreign Car Guide or suitable vintage 
publication that would have plans on making your own camper bed for the back 
of the bus. I thought I had seen something like this before? I got a kombi 
that I dont want to make into a westy, but would like to make a bed that I 
could put in on special occasions.
