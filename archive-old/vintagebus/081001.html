OK here's a question then, did the 67 and earlier have any noise reduction
in the engine department?
Hi Coocoo,
In our pre-1963 buses (1960 walk thru panel and 1962 SO-34 Westie) there is 
none in the engine compartment.  As others have stated the only insulation was 
inside the cargo area.  Best sound proofing for your buck is to have an engine 
built with CW crank, all other recipicating engine parts balanced and a 
freeway flier tranny!
  BTW some bay window owners post to this list because they have 1968-71 
buses which have engines much like the 1950-67 buses.
