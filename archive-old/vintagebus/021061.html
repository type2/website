&gt; ???  $8K!!!  Without paint!   Come on now.  There are not that many parts to
&gt; a Thing.

You'd be surprised.  A top-quality engine rebuild, using
mostly new components and top-notch machining can run about
$2k.   To completely go thru the brakes on an early *bus*
will run you about $700, don't know what it is on a Thing.
Body pieces for things are getting expensive because they
are getting popular now, and never were numerous.   Bodywork
is expensive, figure at least $50/hr. 

Oh, and Harry's Thing was electric, so I'm sure there's
some extra expense there, ie batteries, motor, whatnot.

The money disappears like you wouldn't believe.  Take a gander
at some of your 911 receipts some time...
