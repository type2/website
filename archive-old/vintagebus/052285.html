&gt; Ok, so who has been paid to take a bus?

          I've never been paid for taking a bus, but I can think of several I 
should have been paid for!  I still manage to pick up a splittie here and 
there for cheap.  My unmolested 58 Kombi cost me $200.  My daily driver 
Baywindow set me back $350.  You just gotta be at the right place, right 
time, and have cash in your back pocket.  The 58 was a weird score.  My 
family and I were looking for a park one day about a mile for our house.  We 
passed what looked like a brand new home (250K range-very nice pad) with a 
school bus and the 58 parked next to it.  Both buses were completely covered 
in green moss.  Turns out the guy bought the Kombi, drove it half way home it 
tossed a rod ,had it towed home,and parked it.  The bus had been sitting for 
the past 5 years when I found it.  Luckily the School bus was between the 
Kombi and the house.  Poor guys house burnt down totally scorching the side 
of the School Bus.  Insurance got him a new house and as far as I know, the 
old School Bus is still there.
      Once bought a 59 Std for $250 plus a set of square back cards and a 
shot 009, but I'll save that for another time.
                                                                     Peace,
