Subject: sound-deadening ??

I know there are a couple of sites on this topic but I just feel that there 
are several options at differing prices.

I have decided for a winter project, (Maybe we really do not have winters in 
Northern California), to make the 63 singlecab more drivable.
The main problem is that it gets really noisy when driving above 50-55 mph.
I seem to be able to keep up with the traffic with the big-nut tranny &amp; 
205x15 tires, although I still have to tach it so that I am not really over-revving 
my baby.

There seems to be a plethora of sound deadening materials.

the stuff they sell in car stereo paces like circuit city

In my first job out of school I did NVH (Noise Vibration &amp; Handling) for Ford 
of Europe &amp; we drove around with sound meters. Has anyone done any 
quantitative tests instead of not having to turn the radio up when you drive, or more 
likely turning it down when you come to a stop.

Has anyone tried them in a singlecab?
It really is a totally undamped tin box and I can feel the panel behind the 
drivers seat vibrating if I put my hand behind me.

Maybe this is all wrong &amp; I should just be happy driving my 40 year old truck 
around at 50 mph, but it really can go quicker!
