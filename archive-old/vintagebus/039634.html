&gt;Subject: [VB] Oil Filtration Question
&gt;Date: Tue, 1 May 2001 08:10:21 -0700
&gt;
&gt;Hello!
&gt;
&gt;I have been informed lately that I have to use a special oil pump and 
&gt;cannot
&gt;use my stock exhaust if I want to put a spin-on type oil filter on my
&gt;engines.  Is there a way to get around this?
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?  I'm just running 1600's and I feel that a filter would
&gt;lengthen their lives.....
&gt;


Use something like a cb performance maxi 3. This type of oil pump has 
connections for hose lines. Run the hoses to a oil filter. You will need to 
buy a oil filter holder (probably also available at cb perf). Mount this 
somewhere smart, I like the space thats on the left side, under the spare 
wheel area. You can use rubber hose, but I would recommend having braided 
aircraft hose made up to insure that they dont leak, and can hold the 
pressure.
Be sure you pay attention to put the hoses to supply the filter correctly. 
In other words, the OUT of the pump MUST go to the IN side of the filter 
holder, otherwise BANG it explodes and oil goes everywhere.
Also, I would recomend using a fast flow oil filter with a valve such as a 
Fram Mp1 Racing filter. Getting flow is a good idea.
Additionally, buy adding a filter and the hoses, you are increasing the 
amount of oil that you will need to add to the engine, so check you level 
after you add oil.

Jason
Good Luck
