Subject: Score! jealous

I'm a mechanic in southern New York at a small shop, and we do alot of work on air-cooled VW'S because my boss and I love them. Well, anyways. A new customer just towed in a 1967 bus today that he just purchased from the original owner. It is &quot;rust free&quot; and absolutly georgeous! the right front door was hit and besides that 100%. The original owner stated that he never washed it. It was hidden up on blocks for 15 years in a barn in the Bronx. Oh! did I mention that it was only 81,000 miles on it! OK all, here is the kicker...are you sitting down? They bought it for....$1,000. oh I am soooo jealous!!
