&gt;The problem with trying to find Harry's camper photos is that it's on a
frame driven page and you can't get a direct link to the page.  You have
to go to a page, and then click your way there.
&gt; 
Ummm, the only problem was that he forgot to say it was in the &quot;Gallery&quot;.
 If I didn't have such a big site...

Anyway, if you have a web site suggestion for me, pmail it.
