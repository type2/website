&gt;&gt;What state do you live in that inspects the parking brake et al to get your 
&gt;&gt;tags?
&gt;
&gt;TEXAS. Registration and inspection are 2 different things. But you can't
&gt;drive around without either one of the stickers or you get popped by &quot;the
&gt;FUZZ&quot;.

Missouri (where I grew up) is like this too - must have safety inspection
to get tags.  I moved to Texas and it was as Rex said.  Then I moved to
Oklahoma and got a surprise...they have a safety inspection but it isn't
a precondition for tags!  I changed the tag on my Ch_at_vy over within a
month of moving to Oklahoma but I left the Texas inspection sticker on
it for a year or so - a combo of laziness and a couple of things I
didn't think would pass muster.  Finally got an OK inspection sticker
and they didn't say a thing.

Kansas doesn't have any safety inspection at all.  There are cars with
Kansas tags out on the turnpike at 70+ that I wouldn't drive half a
mile to the hamburger stand.
