Subject: Buses in the Shop 2 - October 27, 2001

Hey all,

Just to prove that we don't want the show season to end, Strictly Vintage 
2s' Silicon Valley Chapter along with Volks Authority presents Buses in the 
Shop 2!!  From 9am - 2pm on Saturday 10/27/01, join us for a laid-back day 
of early buses.  This isn't a formal show, but just bring out your bus and 
enjoy hanging out with the rest of the community.  This year we're adding 
an informal swap meet, but you must keep parts inside your bus!  We're also 
asking everyone to bring out at least one can of food for the Second 
Harvest Food Bank as the holiday season will soon be upon us.  There's also 
a $1 BBQ that will get you a raffle ticket as well in case you don't want 
to pack a picnic lunch.  And, if nothing else, come out for the 1958 
Firebus demonstration!!  There's a flyer located at 
http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt as well as vintagebus_dot_com, VW Planet, 
and www.sv2s_dot_com.

Any questions, just email taylor_at_sv2s_dot_com
