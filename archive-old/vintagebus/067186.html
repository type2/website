Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum case update deluxe LONG

&gt;No mention of the trials and tribulations
&gt;of fitting and reassembling the internals.


thought i'd spare the readers!

&gt;
&gt;Crank is DPR, not DPS, 74mm, not 73mm


good point - but rimco clearly states 'clearanced for 73' on 
invoice.... maybe why i had to do extra clearancing?

&gt;main and rod journal measurements vary by.03mm ( .0011&quot;)
&gt;cam lift is measured at .050, not duration.

they also give spec at .000  lift there is .390; at .050 its .355

&gt;cam lobe clearance is the space left with cam lobe at full lift
&gt;You measured to base circle. Subtract the lift.

not sure if i follow - i measured with cam pointed at lifter, lifter 
fully seated in bore. perhaps this is where i goofed?



&gt;
&gt;The specs are not particularly disturbing.
&gt;( DPR cranks are better than you measured :)
&gt;
&gt;Let's forget the borescope and have it medically X-RAID !
&gt;The noise sounds pretty fishy to me.
&gt;Let's take it apart ( just for the halibut :)
&gt;Internal exam should resolve any clearance issue,
&gt;and expose the gremlin.
&gt;For cheap, drain the oil and search the dregs
&gt;( with an aluminum magnet :) or send it out
&gt;to be analyzed ( by the oil brand supplier ).
&gt;Check your FLAPS for this inexpensive service.

my local shop buddy said drive it for 25 miles (gingerly!) and then 
drain oil. look for shavings. if none, it ain't internal - hopefully!
if metal, apart it goes.

in any case (HA HA) i need to build my previous motor back up with 
the leftover parts, and get a spare so's i can at least get around...

btw, many thanx to dave, who has 'talked' to me almost as much as 
ronnie - poor guy :)
