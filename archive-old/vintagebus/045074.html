Well I met a guy from the list (Mark) and we went over to look at the 63
Double door I found in Michigan.  When we got there it was gone.  Somebody had
bought it.   MAN am I bummed.  I didn't realize how much I liked this bus
until it was gone.  So now that I am officially not getting this bus I am
looking for another.  Please give me any help you can since I live in MIchigan
where buses are not seen very often.  I used to live in Florida and my parents
still live there.  So anywhere in between is an option for location, but the
closer to michigan the better.  I wasn't looking for a bus until I saw this
double door....it is gone, so what am I looking for in a bus?  I am not
looking for a major project.  I would like a bus that I could buy and drive
the family around in and restore when the kids get older.  so a daily driver
passenger bus is what I am looking for.  Tell me what you find and maybe I can
join in the bus fun.  Clean double door would be a major bonus. Any tips on
where to look on the net for buses for sale would be good to.

Thanks 
Steve
