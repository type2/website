Hey there,
I've got a few ?'s
Does anyone out there have or know the exact wiring details (mine is a mess) 
between the fans and the switch(6screw terminals)???
Also exact wiring of the fans to the vehicle in user friendly terms:)...
Is there any way I can make sure they work before wiring them completely to 
the bus?
Sorry, I'm very new to wiring and am gonna try to tackle this myself!
Help?
Thanks,
Pete
