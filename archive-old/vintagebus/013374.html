I couldn't agree more. To have a project with as much potential as a
early westy must be a real jazz. But it must be a headache to find the
last few parts to finish a restoration robbed by someone for a non
original bus would be a bummer.
Let's hope the loaf bus people don't get uptight about the same
thing...when a split bus owner steals THEIR stuff.
I only hope everyone enjoys driving, and using their bus as much as I do
my kombi. Maybe the only thing that's worse than a original bus that's
been picked clean is one that's not being enjoyed. So all of you out
there, please drive your veedub and share your stash of knowledge and
parts. Or are all of us just investing in splits for their speculative
value?
