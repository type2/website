Sure, let's meet at Thom's yellow VintageBus panel at 10 ayem.  If the panel doesn't make it, look for my yellowish-orange doublecab. We can take some pictures for the unfortunate ones.  
A 5 transporter caravan will leave Fresno about 5 - 5:30 p.m. on 99, and 5 through LA. Channel 2 or II on the FRS walkie talkies. From north to south we'll have Thom, Craig, me, Karl and sprinkler-man Nate.

I'm getting ready for the trek, installed a Compufire pointless ignition and 45kv coil. Had a bit of trouble until I discovered it replaces the points just fine, but not the rotor. Next on the list is to install a working turn signal switch so I can fake out the SoCal freeway drivers. 

Stop by JT Schmidts after OCTO, order a pint of beer or root beer at the bar on me.
