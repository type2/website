There are (at least) two ways to lower the front of a bus. You can install
an adjustable beam. With this setup the lower you set it, the less travel in
the front suspention.  The plus side of this is that you can set it wherever
you want, or you can use the lowered spindles that are out now.  They offer
the stock ride, but the spindle sits up higher in relation to the rest of
the suspention. The only bad thing is you can't adjust it (they're usually
made with a 3 1/2&quot; drop). With the spindles it would be easier to switch
back to the original too.  I had a set of these spindles on my old 68 bug, &amp;
now have a set on my bus, and the ride is smooth ( smooth as a bus gets
anyway). You could use both if you wanted to (?!?).

&gt;I rode in a friend's lowered bus recently and darn near ended up with
internal injuries after a half hour from the bumpy ride.  My stock height
bus isn't that bumpy, even when I take it off road.  I have never rolled a
bus (knock on wood) and have never owned and driven a lowered bus, and I
have been known to do some crazy driving and driving in odd conditions when
the situation warented it.  I prefer not to lower my buses because I like
the stock look and like to be able to have enough clearance to drive over a
parking block or a tire tread in the road without fear of hitting it.  But
it is a personal preference.  Drive it lowered for a bit, and if you soon
feel your kidneys are bouncing around inside you like a couple of jumping
beans than give it a try stock height.  It is all a preference thing.
&gt;
&gt;My 2 cents.
