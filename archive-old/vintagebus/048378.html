 I have a '67 westy that was pretty complete and unmolested when I bought it
 a few years ago. About an inch below both side interior lights are two small
 holes (one on top of the other). Does anyone know what mounts in these
 holes, or is it a hack of some sort?

 From this pic there doesn't seem to be anything there. Just curious.

 those holes are where you screw in the mount (which is a dogleg of the 
window curtain rods material ) that holds the large rectangular light cover 
which goes over the side dome lights.
