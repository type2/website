Subject: brand spankin new 1600cc
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the past couple of weeks ive been wondering about what kinda motor i wany to 
purchase. i was really leaning toword a gene berg 1600cc set up which would 
be choice and worth the bucks but its hard to let go of all that cash and i 
really dont want to have a shop rebuild a motor for me and i didnt want to go 
to gex to try to save a buck. so today all my worries are gone i was in volks 
authority today to get some little stuff and i look on the floor and theres a 
brand new 1600cc motor. for the last few weeks i havent even thought of going 
brand new.so now im happy but not complete i still need to decide
to either get a freeway flier tranny or stock..hmmmm?
