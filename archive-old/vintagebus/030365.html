It also depends on what part of the country you are in.  Here in So. CA, I see
at least one or two at each Pomona swap.  I passed up (stupidly) a partially
complete Eberspacher 55/56 for 40 bucks, and have picked up two others for
less at other meets.  People out here don't even have or want the cooling
flaps, let alone a gas heater.  I think 150-400 is very high....at least out
here.   For 400 bucks they better install it too.

&gt; worth $150-$400.  But if is for a bug, I wouldn't pay that much unless you
&gt; have a bug.
