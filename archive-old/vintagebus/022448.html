Subject: '54 Progress - it's gone!

Yes, the '54 is gone.  A nice elderly japanese man with a large wad of cash
came by today and now it's off to it's new home (you knew they drove on the
left, right?)

Just kidding!  Gary Lavere picked it up to take it to his shop and see what
they can do with it.  I'm going to have him do basically everything from
the cargo doors forward.

I'll keep you updated with the progress.
