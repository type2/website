Hi Joe,
Check out your battery cables!  If they have those replacement battery clamps 
that are bolted/clamped onto the ends of the cables they will corrode between 
the cables and the replacement clamps causing voltage/amperage drop.  Good 
idea to invest in a voltage meter to check for loss of electrical power in your 
VW wiring.  Could also be time to replace your starter bushing.  Check out 
type2_dot_com for the AIRS list there for volks all over the USA &amp; Canada that will 
have tools, parts, and knowledge of the local area VW scene.
