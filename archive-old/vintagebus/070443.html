Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

I had wolfgang safaris years ago, didn't like 'em.  I went thru
latches like water, and the frames separated.  Don't know if their
new ones are any different.  Oh, and they etched their logo on the
glass, which I thought was *VERY* cheesy.

&gt; Still haven't heard from anyone whether they have had any experience with 
&gt; Wolfgang or Bus Boys Safari's. I can't seem to get a reply to e-mails from 
&gt; Creative, and it doesn't appear that they offer polished frames.
