&lt;&lt; Basically what someone needs to do is take a double-door and move the
 stuff from the current lunchwagen to a less-rusty home.  He had a 
 DD to go with it for the transplant.  I was tempted, but I have a large
 enough project as it is... &gt;&gt;

Well, then it wouldn't be so unique then, would it? I don't know why this 
bothers me so much, but it does. If you were to take another panel and 
convert all of the lunch bus stuff to that, then where is the authenticity of 
it actually being a coachbuilt. It's like turning kombis into deluxes. I 
understand the current panel needs lots of work, and would be real expensive, 
but owning a one off bus like that would be well worth it. Or cheaping out 
and loosing the vin # and M # from the original will make up for the money to 
be made when it would be sold to Japan when done. Don't say it cant be fixed, 
I bet Kelly could.
