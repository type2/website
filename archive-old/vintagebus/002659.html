Subject: Is this good service?

On April 25th, I ordered some Weber 40IDF idle stops from Performance
Warehouse in New York.  The parts still haven't arrived and the one time I
called and left a message (a week ago), my call wasn't returned as the
answering machine said it would be.

Is this good service or bad?  I haven't received my CC statement in order to
see if I've been billed for the parts or not and I've thoroughly checked the
house over to make sure the mail wasn't misplaced.  Anyone have any comments
on this?  It takes exactly one week for me to gets parts from Ronnie in
Arizona so shouldn't the trip from New York to hear take only about 7 to 9
days UPS ground?

Later...
