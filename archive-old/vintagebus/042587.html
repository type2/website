&gt; Hey all...
&gt; I put a new main seal in the other day and had my motor sitting out as I
&gt; don't have someone to help me lift it down onto the jack to stick it in
&gt; the bus.  I went out today and put the clutch back in and noticed a bit
&gt; of oil on the flywheel.  Not much...just a tad.  Maybe this is some left
&gt; over from before?? i thought I cleaned it all off.  So...off with the
&gt; flywheel again...and I cleaned it all up, inspected the seal, and all
&gt; was fine.  I hope that was the end of my problems.  If not...another
&gt; seal is on order...and I'll have to find why it is leaking...  Any
&gt; suggestions??
well,

after talking to you the other day i suspect your crank/flywheel gasket.
If you dont have an o-ring flywheel, you need that gasket between the
flywheel and crank or oil will weep out around the gland nut and dowels.

But if you put it in you will have to redo your endplay, as it adds a few
thou clearance...

take care,

Steve
