You all live life on the wild side.  NONE of you said duct tape and bailing

wire.  Are you people crazy?  I NEVER leave home without the above mentioned

items.  As of yesterday; add a hammer for my starter to the list.  Thanks

again Matt for the push :-)

the duct tape sits on the ledge between the driver seat and the door.  It 
doubles as a cup holder.  Bailing wire lives under the back seat, and also on 
the roof rack.  I like to wire things to the roof rack.   Bungee cords are 
okay, but steel is real.    

WHe traveleing from Canada to the US which for somereason I was doing a lot 
one one road tripping, I discovered that the canadians were friendly (have a 
nice vacation, eh), and the Americans had problems with a couple in an od VW 
entering the border.  Every time they searched the bus, and interregated us 
like we were criminals, international conspirtors, and drug runners.      Of 
course, camping and going to national parks was merely a cover story.    gets 
old.  The last time before we crossed the border, we intentionally made the 
bus a huge mess, didn't do our dishes, etc, and left bits of spikey wire  
(remember the bailing wire- this is a good use) and greasy rags all over 
inside.    I think we wrote POT on our jar of oregano in the box of 
cookstuff.   The grumpy US inspectors wear bright white starched shirts.  HA 
ha search that!!
