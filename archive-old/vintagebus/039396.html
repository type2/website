Alright, my first series of questions regarding stock setups is with the 
interior.  (Once again, I own a '67 deluxe with pearl white/velvet green.)
When I bought my bus, it was apparent that the interior had been redone many 
times over.  I looked into the upholstery codes on type2_dot_com, and it said 
that the upholstery match for my exterior color is platinum and mesh grey.  
Is this correct?  If so, how exactly is this set up with the seats...in the 
RMM catalog I only see one tone upholstery pieces.  Also, how is this 
related the interior panels?
Also, one more interior question.  Between the cab and the rear area in my 
bus there is a divider.  When I bought the bus, this divider was fully 
covered with a wooden panel then covered with furry cloth.  In RMM (yes, I 
like the catalog) I see that there are two panels that cover this area 
originally.  Does this mean that the &quot;tire-bulge&quot; is left uncovered and just 
painted pearl white?
Thanks for all your help guys,
