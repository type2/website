The first step should be: &quot;be born with a last name like 'rockefeller' or
'getty'&quot;

You don't want to know what I have into the '54 - eeek!

I spent over $7k on the '56

I have over $6k into the '55 so far

&gt; &gt; I agree totally.  First step in a resto is through out any and all schedules.  they will not be  made for many different reasons.  Organization, patience and time are the key ingrediance.
