I am not sure what size your vessel is, but I remember seeing at one time or
another this small electric coil-looked smilar to the thing on an electrixc
stove, that you could put in a mug or maybe somewhat larger container to heat
the water(I think it was for reheating coffes, or maybe just heating up
tea-not really sure....
