Subject: Re: Its Here-thoughts

Thoughts from &quot;uj&quot; at 65 years young regarding the &quot;New&quot; bus--We all know that the most
popular VW out there is the VW Bus--In the VW Hobby the biggest single type shows are
always &quot;Da Bus&quot;.
OCTO--BBB---Jerome--  just to name a few, are monster size shows basically restricted to
the Type II.
OCTO even limits it to 1967 and earlier--I cannot think of any other Type in the VW Hobby
that can even come close in the size of these shows. As much as some of you may &quot;Dislike&quot;?
the NB--It has brought attention to the VW Hobby--Now &quot;Other&quot; people are recognizing the
Vintage VW that we are driving--There some hard core Type II Titans out there that do not
consider the 1968 and newer buses-A VW Bus!  I owned a 1968 absolutely Cherry VW Bus--It
was so clean and original at 100,000+ miles that it won 1st place at a World of Wheels
show in its class against Restored American iron! One of the most notable bus Gurus, and a
friend of mine Charley Hamill--would always kid me and say-&quot; Jerry--you Almost own a VW
Bus&quot;!  There will always be a division amongst us with our VWs--Regarding the years or the
styling--That's good--it shows we are proud of what we own.  Perhaps VW of Germany did not
come out with a pre1967 styling clone in a VW Bus--because the lawyers of VW of America
would try to shut them down for infringement of the company logo!   It is OK
to not like the New VW Bus--But remember this--If it does come out--It will be nothing but
Good News to us that own Vintage VW Buses--I'm &quot;down&quot; to just 3 Vintage VW Buses--1951
microbus--
1963 23 window--&amp; 1967 Bessie --Yet still looking for just one more.? The New VW Bus will
never change what i feel for my VW &quot;Family&quot;--But i do know that more people will recognize
the Early VW Buses--because of the interest in the NB--Which now could mean New Beetle or
New Bus--We can close ranks--but never close our minds--accept what is new- because it IS
new--Hug or drive your Vintage VW bus today--it is still and always be the most unique
vehicle ever to grace the roads and many times non-roads of the World--TWWM, uj
