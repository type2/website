&gt; Enough already!!  Take it to private emails!  PLEASE!
&gt; Keep in mind you're flooding people's mail boxes with stuff they probably don't want
&gt; to hear.  Some people pay by the minute for internet access, so spare them if you
&gt; will.  Some people, such as myself, don't want to hear it!  I admit, I've done it
&gt; before, but I knew when to stop, and I learned after that time and it never happened
&gt; again.  So enough is enough.
