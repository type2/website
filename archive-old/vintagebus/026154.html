&gt; Just went to Costco to buy one of those large car shelters - garages they had
&gt; in the summer, the ones that are big enough to drive a car in.
&gt;
&gt; these were the ones that cost about $170
&gt; same story from K-Mart
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas who stocks them as a normal item ?
&gt;

I got mine at Home Depot, $179  The metal was galvanized and not white like
costco's and the roof was silver tarp
