&lt;&lt; So I'm getting the impression that I goofed. 215/75/15 is too large by all
the replies I'm getting.  But I also see why I ran into this problem.   A)
there is a legend of too many tire threads on the list, so I didn't ask :) B)
Archive searches revealed conflicting info as to 165 or 195 being the &quot;stock
size&quot; for 6.40 x 15&quot; .  I followed the 195 size -- but now believe that the
metric conversion actually comes out closer to 165 (slightly less in fact).
Can someone confirm this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
The 1954-67 bug used a 5.60x15 bias ply with a 25&quot; dia.and today 165R15 is the
same dia. radial though it is wider than the original bias ply and has
problems fitting in the spare position in the K. Ghia.  The 215/75R15 is the
same 27&quot;dia. as the original 1955-63 bus tires.  Being a radial they are going
to be wider due to thier ballon cross section compared to the original thin
bias ply tires.  We do know that the 205/75R15 will fit in the 1955-67 front
wheel wells and have heard that the 215/75R15 will fit also.  As for the rear
wheel wells, 205/75R15s will fit with no problem and 215/75R15 will fit
tightly deflated when installing  the 1955-62 bus.  For 1963-67 you can fit
all the way up to 235/75R15 which has a 29&quot; dia and due to it's width will rub
one tiny spot on the rear suspension only when the bus is on jacks.  You can
grind this spot to remove the interferance of the suspension in less than 10
seconds each side.  Above all it must be remembered that just because
different brands of tires have the same size designation does not mean that
they will be the same width.  Ask your local tire dealer for both stiffer side
wall and thinnest profile of that size radial possible.  Doing this we have
found both P and LT radials that work well on the bus in windy conditions.
Plus both of these pairs of tires after 30,000 miles of driving hardly show
any sign of wear.

PS If you run 25&quot; dia tires and replace only the rears with 27&quot; dia tires your
top speed will go up 3MPH.  Then if you go to 29&quot; dia tire on only the rear it
will go up a additional 3.6MPH over the 27&quot; dia tire.  EEE&amp;B
