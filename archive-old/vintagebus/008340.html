Subject: Parting out 1957 Standard Sunroof
Date: Wed, 21 Mar 2001 18:47:59 -0500

As sad as it is, it appears the general consensus is that it is shot, and
I'm not one to disagree. Too far gone for me, so I'm parting it out now.
There were 3 people email me before about parts off of it, and I have since
built a new (1gHZ) computer and lost all my old emails and such, so if still
looking, I am officially parting it out now. I believe the sunroof to be
gone already, as is maybe the decklid and rear apron, but everything else is
still up for grabs. Oh yeah, bent door handle is spoken for too.
:-)  Keep BUGN,
