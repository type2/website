&gt;
&gt;I owned for a short time,  a 1966 Westfalia Dormobile Wrke # 5000, that had
&gt;the long rectangular shaped light lense which slipped over a metal bracket
&gt;of equal length that contained the bulb and switch. This was a European
&gt;Delivery model as well. Is this what you are describing?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By the way, I sold the Dormobile to another bus enthusiast and it ended up
&gt;in Cincinnati in the early 90s'........ In your neck of the woods??
