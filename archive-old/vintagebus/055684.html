Subject: Re: [VB] Dying at stop lights -me too.

no no im not saying i havent adjusted the valves in 10k miles! haha im just
sayin i havent done that *recently yet* in diagnosing my stalling problem.
my valves get adjusted every 2 or 3k. Im just curious if they could loosen
up that much in a short time and cause stalling.


&gt;after 10k miles im sure your valves need adjusted, 3k is the regular
&gt;maintenance and key for keeping that brand new mexi motor going for a long
&gt;time.  not being sarcastic at all.  if i were you, id take the ten minutes
&gt;in the morning and do a valve adjustment before i drive anywhere.

&gt;re-adjust the valves .... is it possible that your valves can go that far
&gt;out of wack from normal use/normal circumstances that the engine would want
&gt;to die?&quot;
