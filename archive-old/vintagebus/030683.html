Robert &quot;'59 Westy&quot; Davis asked:
&gt; Question 2: Were the early ('59) engine compartment seals mitred at the
 corners?  And if so, would it make sense to try and mitred the new aftermarket
 seals, or just install in four separate pieces?
&gt;
My early '60 Truck with the original seal has mitered corners.  The original
paint under the seal has no glue, at least on the left, right, and bottom
sides.

I personally think you should miter them.
