Had Nankang bias plys on the now long since sold 54
Barnambulator. Liked them real well. By the way the
spelling *kang* is correct not *king* as I've seen it
in posts. There is a bias ply tire named PowerKing
that some of my buddies and budettes have on their 16&quot;
wheeled beasties. I was unable to locate that brand
when shopping.

I like the heck out of the 205-75-15&quot; KUHMO tires that
I run on the 63 Sleazy Camper. Stable, wear well and
available at Discount Tires.
Have a great week!
