Subject: Headlight high &amp; headlight low

Here's a question. My left headlight on my 66 Bus is super bright (high
beam) and my right headlight is normal. How does one have a headlight that
seems to be set on high beam and the other not? I thought it was either or.
I have my high/low relay connected to my headlight wires 56a &amp; 56b etc. but
they're not connected to the high beam switch yet. 


Any ideas?
