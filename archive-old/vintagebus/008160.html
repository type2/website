i was looking at a bottle of rubber cement when i had an epiphany...
why not save on tires and do my own?
all ya gotta do i think is every time you drive the bus, jack it up later
and roll the wheels around, giving them a light coat of rubber cement.
maybe glue them road gators (thrown truck tire treads) back onto my bus'
tires....
anyone done this before?

thanks...
