&lt;&lt; I still think that the best place for the filter is just after the outlet
 of the fuel tank.  A bit messier to change, but it will protect the lines
 and pump when located here. &gt;&gt;

I prefer two filters in the line from the tank to the pump.  One goes under 
the tank just before the line goes through the front sheet metal, and the 
other goes near the pump.  I disconnect the fuel line from the pump end 
filter when pulling the engine, and always leave a lot of excess line to the 
left of the engine bay, both so that I can pull the engine out quite a ways 
before disconnecting, and also, to keep the fuel line in the coolest area 
(near the left air intake) to keep vapor lock at a minimum (the desert here 
is quite hot (Albuquerque), and gasoline is not what it used to be).
