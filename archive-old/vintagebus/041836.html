&gt; Here in South Afrca much of the air cooled parts stock of dealers was

&gt; their dealerships from selling on their obsolete stock in favour of sending
&gt; it to the crusher. I can only imagine what sort of stuff was lost in this
&gt; way. I believe that this is a fairly common policy amongst manufacturers
&gt; internationally.

Some, but not all.  Porsche, MB, and Nissan are three auto companies that
seem to support their older vehicles pretty well.  I can still order parts
from the Nissan dealer for a '69 Datsun 510, which isn't exactly a
collector's dream.

Seems kind of silly to throw away parts that only become more valuable
with age.  I'll bet that some of the &quot;crushers&quot; they sold the parts to are
the same sources that the &quot;NOS&quot; stuff is coming from now.
