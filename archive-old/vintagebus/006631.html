I sat on a bus out here for 2 months waiting to get authorization from GEX
to replace the engine, their comments were Pull the engine, send us the
defective parts, we will check them out to see if it is a warranty issue,
then decide weather or not to warranty it, then will send you the parts to
repair and pay ME what they think is a fair rate, basically r/r engine tear
down and repair for 150.00 dollars, I don't think so. I refused to work that
way so the owner had the bus towed to another shop,  when they tore the
engine down it had defective valves and had developed a rod knock, GEX would
not warranty this engine, they said it was the owners fault, It only had
1100 miles on it and was installed by a competent VW shop. GEX's answer to
all inquiries was YOU HAVE A BURNT piston, this was to all questions about
what might have happened, no matter what was said as to what happened the
answer was always the same&gt; Very bad customer relations in my opinion, and a
very junky engine. The last time I tore one down it had a 30 rod 40 main
crank, we checked the rods over 9 grams difference, line bore was 80 over
with a double cut thrust and the thrust bearing was not a nice snug fit,
silicon on the oil pump. This engine had around 10,000 miles on it when it
gave up the ghost.

Bottom line - GEX sends out product that is marginal at best.  When you mass
produce engines on the level they do, quality control is next to nil.  I got
a set of heads from them that were so far gone, they needed rebuilding.
Don't get me wrong, the heads were within spec but not NEW (as they should
be when building a new engine.)  There have been numerous reports of engines
throwing rods, over heating, etc.  Oh yeah, they'll take it back but you're
out a wad for the shipping...
