Subject: 1965 5.8 Liter Crewcab saga Conts.

 Will be kinda long and not for purests or VN's. Sunday afternoon and on call
for work so can't go antwhere and Denise is bartending tonight so thought I
would sit down and cont. the story. Left last time with removing the crewcab
from the neighbors fence and shed. Finally got Farmers working on the claim.
Removed the p.o.s. shifter the po put in and chocked the rear tires. Checked
radiator and added water and fired up motor ofter giving the white kite string
throttle a few tugs. Fired right up and gave the string a few more heavy tugs
and felt my right leg getting wet (not  from excitement) but from water
spraying from the intake manifold by right head ( was pissing out more water
than Kyle after a night of boozing and pissing down wind). Shut it down and
removed carb, distributor, and manifold. Forgot to remove lower rad hose and
filled valley and lifter area with water. Was going to change oil and filter
anyway, just not this soon. Installed new gaskets, manifold, carb and
distributor ( hour later after turning oil pump shaft). Removed filter and
drained oil, (vw drain pan was to small and got about 2 qts on driveway) and
installed new filter and put in 5 qts 20/50 oil. First Chevy I have worked on
in many years. Gave string a pull to set choke and fired motor up. Reved it
afew time and went to side door to check motor. Saw leak at back of motor and
then oil was blowing everywhere, pulled coil wire this time. 4 more qts. of
oil on the driveway. Looked like rear main or cam plug blew. Crawled under and
checked cam plug with coat hanger and was OK, happened to look at oil filter
and seal was blown. No oil left so removed filter and found I had left old
filter seal on block and it had blownout. Chevys were starting to suck. The
new B&amp;M shifter finally got here and I got it installed Sat afternoon. While
under crewcab found what was left of throttle linkage and got it patched
together with a univer. VW cable kit. Got new oil filter today and a heavy
throttle return spring. Got them both installed and it was time to see what
would happen. removed the seats that came with bus and SET in a set of 914
seats. Hopped in, pumped gas and went through the gears with foot on brake.
All seemed Ok so figured what the heck. Put shifter in 3rd and hit it. Burned
out 8 feet on the driveway, flipped me and the seat back into the motor
(forgot seat was not bolted in)and was heading for the pool again. No panic
this time, reached over and pulled coil wire. Got out and had a beer.
Installed coil wire and backed bus back into driveway. Figured all was really
OK now as things always happen to me in threes and this was the third thing to
happen. Put seat back up and fired motor and headed down driveway  for a run
up the street. Up the street was nice and slow, all gears working. Turned
around and had afew people watching on return trip. Turned around at other end
of street and held on and floored it. Chirpped tires on two of the auto
changes and fishtailed like a mother. Turned around again and headed up my
driveway with one last burnout. Backed it in and all the guys came around and
said I was F----n crazy. Got out with  body shaken, boy was it a rush. Then
noticed water leaking under front of motor. New water pump goes on this week
and seats and belts will get bolted in. Still a ton of small things to do and
a whole lot of body work. Will take it to DMV Wed and get it legalized. Can't
wait to get it on the road. O yea, got to get the trailor hitch installed (
maybe a 5th wheel hitch).
 Also working on the 56 safari  bus. 1 stock, 1 modified, best of both VW
worlds.
