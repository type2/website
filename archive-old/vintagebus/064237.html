Subject: Fw: [VB] Removed my front beam

&gt; Take a small inspection mirror and take a good look of the interior just
&gt; inside the opening you carved into it.  If there is rust you will have to
&gt; figure out how to get it out of there and a sandblaster will probably not
be
&gt; able to spray almost backwards towards the operator to get the rust out.
&gt; Phosphoric could easily be painted in there and thusly no sand needing to
be
&gt; cleaned out of there.

Thats a good idea - I didn't really want to blast in there but the
phosphoric would probably work better.

&gt;We wonder about installing a threaded plug and
&gt; treating the interior area with either tranny gear oil or one of the
&gt; waxy/oily undercoating to help prevent the spread of rust if moisture does
&gt; get in there.

My tutor at evening classes suggested that.  He recommended that I drilled a
hole on the outside just below the top shock mount, and used us Brits
favourite product, Waxoil, and then using a grommet that is sold
specifically for this purpose.

Thanks
Paul
