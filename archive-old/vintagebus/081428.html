Subject: Re: [VB] Door handles.

Clara,

Thanks for all the great info. Seems I have the &quot;special&quot; 3 month edition bus.
It was manufactured in October 63 for the 64 year. It has the original locks
and keys all around (I know because my Dad purchased the vehicle new and I
have had it since '72). Only the rear hatch is a T series. The ignitiion and
all the door locks are the 54-63 codes. :-(

Alex at ISP West has obtained new flipper handles with T code locks, but I
found that my earlier lock barrels fit into the handles. So I am in luck there
as I can install my old locks in the new handles.  For the cargo doors, I may
just have to bite the bullet and have them re-chromed as the lock barrels
changed when they went to the T code locks.

Details, details, it is all in the details.

Chris

  Your 64 bus would have comenew with a T series key that fit all door locks,
and the ignition (unless it came with a steeering lock).
