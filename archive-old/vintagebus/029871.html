Subject: [VB] My new business card.

I know this has little to do with busses, so I hope the list may forgive
my transgression, yet I think this is very important.

NQ,

When you order ANYTHING from an email solicitaion or from a TELEPHONE
MARKETER, you are only encouraging them to multiply. Think of them as
&quot;timethieves&quot;. If you buy anything from a thief, don't be surprised when
your home is broken into.
