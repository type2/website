It's doable, but can get confusing. Best to label all the wires as you pull 
them off AND make a diagram of your own with remarks about the colors and 
thicknesses of the wires that came off each terminal. The combination of 
both labeling the wires and drawing the diagram will keep it pretty clear 
when it goes back together.

Thommy Boy Fitzpatrick is very cool and hosts color wiring diagrams on his 
bus website. It's a great service to the VW community. Plus, his sight is 
one of the best out there, with tons of VW information and pictures. I 
doubt anyone doesn't know this, but if you havn't been to 
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com you should really go and check it out. It's a fun 
sight.
