 while yours is in the shop? &gt;&gt;

What do you mean, buy another bus?  Don't you have spares already?  I know 
that I have a bus for every purpose;  doesn't everyone?  My double cab for 
hauling, my everyday panel, and my SO-23 for cross country use.  And what's a 
beater?  All my busses need paint and rust repair, but I'm never sitting by 
the side of the road.  (Watch, now that I said that, I'll have some sort of 
trouble on the way to LA this weekend.)
