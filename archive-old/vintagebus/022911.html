I have AAA for my driver bus.  They don't do ACV per-se, but they do have
an reference that they use to index the buses condition against a given
value.  It may not be the value *you* think it should be, but at least it's
something.

The best thing you can do is get your *own* supporting documents together
while you still have the bus.  Get it appraised, keep all of your major
receipts, and grab onto any ads for buses that are similar to yours.

When my '59 convertible was stolen a couple years ago, that's what saved my
bacon.  I had a stack of receipts, and some ads for similar cars.  They
settled for a value significantly above what their &quot;Gold Book&quot; said.   

I got lucky.

Another local bus guy, who owned the panel in the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; bus
poster, was smacked by someone who ran a light.  AAA wouldn't give him the
time of day.   They wanted to write him off for $1500, despite the
documentation he had to the contrary.  By the time he was doing paying for
all the lawyer fees n stuff, he was still below water.
