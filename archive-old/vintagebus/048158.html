no, the plastiic plug for blocking off the regular ignition switch hole is a 
unique piece, sorry.   luckily, it is merely decoration and you don't 
actually need it for function. 

 BTW,   I have some NOS steering column collars- the piece in the locking 
column needed to make the lock work.  W/o a locking column the tongue on the 
lock does not stop the steeing column shaft  and the thus the wheel from 
turning.    a regular column can be made into a locking one w/ this piece, 
assembly required.

Was that plug the same as the door screw plugs?
