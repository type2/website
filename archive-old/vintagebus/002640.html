hello vintage list,
this is my first post here. I usually stay with 68 to 71's. but I am helping a friend with a 67. so far we have rebuilt the motor line bore out hole 9 yards runs sweet. repaired doors and latches that didn't want to work anymore. installed a radio without cutting anything.

now the problem

try as we may the rear drivers turn signal refuses to work. all 3 other flash happily. turn on the flashers and all 4 flash. with all 4 flashing I am under the assumption that the wiring to the light is good. including the fuse too. do I assume too much? I am leaning towards the flasher. I have reseated all the connectors on it. removed the fuses cleaned and turned over swapped locations etc.

any thoughts? and to answer the question, no. I do not have a diagram for a 67. 68 thru 71 I have. I'll be getting a new manual soon.

thanks
rory mccormick
