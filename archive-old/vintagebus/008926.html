Hey everybody,
So, I will be coming down for the show in Puyallup this weekend.  I'm just
wondering who's going to be camping with the Wetwesties, and is it in the
campground next to the fairgrounds?  Because I've always just camped in the
field in between instead, and I'm wondering what is the point of paying for
a campground with no washrooms?  I really have no use for electrical or
sewer hookup, so....  I do want to camp with everybody else though.
Anyway, see y'all there.
Diana
