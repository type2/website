Many suppliers have those as a reproduction.  Not for the vintage purist
(hit the swaps for original ones...they are plentiful).  Ronnie from Old
Volks has them for under 20 a pair (reproduction) if I'm not mistaken. 
I'm sure he'll chime in with the actual cost.  The reproductions are
fairly good (a plus is that they have a ground pigtail installed) and if
you use a OG lens and trim ring and screws, almost no one will know its
a repop.
