Subject: Re:  Looking for 60 walkthough drivers seat.

was wrt:


I am very close to installing a newer style driverseat in my bus,
an adjustable seat with the rails. It seems to move the seat over 
to the center a little 
But before I start modifying:
Any fellow busser have a spare  60 style driver seat lying around?

- - - - -
yup, hard to find.  

yes the later sliding seat buses have the seat center behind the steering 
wheel, but are you sure that is the slding seat, and not where it is put.   
believe the early walkthrough dont have the space by the door for the coffee 
cup.   Is the driver side of the walkthrough smaller?  Yes this is hard to 
find a seat for.   I'd sell the bus, trade it in on something more comfy, 
like a bench seat model  (please no flames)
