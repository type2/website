undo the taillight screws on the left side.  Remove the lens and push the 
bulb holder into the bus.   Reach around and see what holds the T handle in 
place- probabbly a 10mm nut.  reach a ratchet in there, undo the nut and pull 
the handle off.   leave the handle off, and get  a church key.

Is there an easy way to unlock a t-handle without the key? It seems that the 
guy I got it from has never had a key for the locks (only ignition) and some 
how the handle locked when I closed it last. So now I am unable to get to my 
engine compartment and I need to get this thing going, I am sick of looking 
at it (Ok, I'm sick of pretending to drive it) 
Is it possible to unbolt the apron from underneath?
Anybody in Houston know a locksmith?(that wouldn't charge an arm and a leg?)
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Brian
