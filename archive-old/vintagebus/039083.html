Subject: RE: Generator pulley questions (Bosch)
Date: Mon, 19 Oct 1998 10:03:27 -0500

&gt;What confuses me is that two generators I have -- the inside half of 
&gt;the pulley does NOT spin freely on the shaft ... yet the new ones 
&gt;does.  I also notice a &quot;key cut&quot; in the shaft, but nothing seems to 
&gt;mate with it... Not on the one I took off, nor on the one that I put
on.

On mine there is a halfmoon or woodruff (sp?) key that fits in the slot
of the shaft.  The inner piece of the pulley has a corresponding notch
in it.  

I'm screwing around with mine right now because the key has wallowed out
my shaft and pulley.  I found a 1/32&quot; (wide) x 1/2&quot; (long) key from the
local parts store is pretty close.  I'll have to use the grinder to
remove a TINY bit of the width to get it to fit.

Hope this helps.
