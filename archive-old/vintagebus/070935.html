Subject: RE: [VB] 6V starter

The v80 has had a little trouble starting ever since I got it... I've
been trying to get it in shape for the upcoming Yakima show so that has
been top priority.... hey, what 59 double cab???    I pulled the
starter, cleaned it up, sanded the armature, cleaned the brushes,
checked all the ground and positive connections, tried a different
solenoid, bought a new battery, and was about to put in another starter
when it hit me... the battery and electrics and even starter where in
perfect shape but the real reason the starter was having so much trouble
turning the motor over was the bushing in the trans housing.  Sure
enough, I pulled the starter for the umpteenth time, stuck my little
finger in the hole and pulled it easily out.  The thing was shot... I
mean WAY bad.  Obviously, there was no support on the one end causing
the motor to grind away on the inside of the starter body.  One of the
final clues was that the starter itself was VERY hot after attempting to
start it.  A quick call to Ronnie and two should show up in the mail
today for an enjoyable labor day weekend project along with changing the
axle boots and finishing up the control wiring in the boom.   Yea, I
guess there was a post way back when from either Eric&amp;Barb or Clara
ranting about that bushing that also helped.  Thanks!

Steve continued with is 6V starter quest...
I'm trying to start a 6v motor with a 6v starter.  All original motor
but it sat for a long time.  With a good 6v battery all I can do is get
the solenoid to click.  It will not turn the engine over.  I hooked my
bus (12v) to it and while it was idling I can get the starter to engage
and barely turn the motor in about 1/2 revolutions.  All this while the
plugs are out and I've oiled the cylinders down.  I can turn the engine
over with a breaker bar and socked on the pulley end.  It is fairly
tight, but not overly so, about what a good tight new motor would be
like.

I've taken the starter all apart and cleaned it and checked the
brushes...all is as it should be.

Any ideas why the starter is not functioning...especially when supplied
with 12-13 volts??  Thanks
