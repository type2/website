&gt; &lt;&lt; Good point!
&gt;  I bought a $9 item...the seller is going to charge me $4 to ship it
&gt;  priority!!!!!!!!!  Better day on that.  Send it cheapo or don't bother. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One of the benefits to the seller with priority mail is the post office
&gt; supplies the boxes for free.  If you are shipping a lot of things not having
&gt; to find boxes is a huge consideration
&gt;

As well as the fact that most of the time &quot;Parcel Post&quot; is only 5 cents
cheaper..........I know I do alot of eBaying and mailing
