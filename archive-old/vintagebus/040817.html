Over on the Ts list, things are a little bit more  on the 'dark side'
when it comes to customization.  One person has a 5 speed in their
T3, and my summarization is that unless you are racing or going after 
the 'cool' factor, it just causes more shifting.  It doesn't enlarge 
the envelope of gearing, just adds more within the existing high 
and low range.

There are large engine folks over there also.  Check out the website
at  www.vwtype3_dot_org and perhaps join the list for awhile.  One of
the leaders of the Dark side is off list for a while, but he'll
be back.  Be prepared for a volume of only around 50+ messages daily,
as it's the winter season, it'll pick up as things warm up.

-------------------------------------------

Hello there,
Has anyone ever put a 5 speed (non porsche) tranny in their bus?  Is
there one that would require no hacking?  I believe that Berg makes a 5
speed for a beetle... could this be put into the bus?  Is it possible to
have a 5-speed tranny with the stock bus gears 1,2,3, and 4...and then
put in a higher 5th gear.. like a .77?  I don't know what the R&amp;P should
be...or what the best one to have in there would be either... or which
redux boxes to run...

Also...has anyone ever run an engine larger than an 1835 (say...a 2110)
as a daily driver and have good reports of it?  If so...what was your
setup?
