Not sure if this helps with your situation but...
I bought my bus from someone who had it registered in Canada, they were
traveling through thte staes until they sold it. Anyway, what the RMV in
Massachusetts would not honor the canadian registration, I had to have a
police officer go out to my car and sign a from acknowledging that the vin #
on the auto matched the vin # on the papers. Other that that no problems.

good luck.
