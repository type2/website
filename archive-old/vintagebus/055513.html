Subject: Jay's question on Winter Driving

In answer to Jay's question...I normally put my bus away in November and
don't bring it back out until April.  Often, however, I get &quot;bus fever&quot;
during one of our Ohio thaws (towards the end of January or first of
February) and go for a day trip somewhere.
