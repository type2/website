Subject: Re: [VB] GL4 oil needed!~ HELP!

Do you have a NAPA in your town? If so, they carry STA-LUBE brand GL-4. 
They probably will have some smaller bottles on the shelf, and bigger 
containers behind the counter.

&gt;I am CLOSE to getting this engine in and my bus running in the next couple
&gt;weeks, some trival cost, yet important parts and time to go. I desperately
&gt;need gl4 75-90 or straight 90 for my trans, I will settle for either. I live
&gt;in PA, and can't find it anywhere. Please advise to mail order source, or
&gt;someother way to get it...I have called farm tractor stores, all the auto
&gt;parts houses (most haven't a clue), and am often told to use the gl5. I want
&gt;to be safer than sorry, even if I am wrong, please help with source! Will
&gt;pay to have shipped (1 or 2 gal) to me.....
&gt;Oilless in PA...
