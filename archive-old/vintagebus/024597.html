I've used DOT 5 silicone brake fluid with excellent results in several of
my 50's-60's American cars for years. The upside is absolutely no corrosion
of metal hydraulic parts with proper installation - complete flushing of
all traces of conventional brake fluid is mandatory, including replacement
of all rubber parts with uncontaminated fresh rubber. I recently opened up
a brake system for inspection that I converted in 1981- the fluid looked
like new and the wheel cylinders were clean and shiny - no signs of
corrosion or seal deterioration. Impressive! The downside is higher cost of
the fluid and the hassle of proper flushing. I have heard some reports of
possible incompatibility on some types of cylinder rubber cups, but have no
first-hand knowledge of problems with proper installation.

Has anybody out there ever converted a VW to DOT 5 silicone fluid? If so,
any negative results?

Kris
