Now we have to see our copy maybe in Ventura.

Pretty sure this is your DC

attached silver awning on pass. side. Dash mounted fan, small flexible 
black antenna.

I just received my issue of Airhead Parts catalog.   I was scanning 
through looking at all of the nice stuff I could get for my new Ghia.  
(I just sold my bug to at 72 year old lady who says she bought it to 
&quot;tootle&quot; around in).  As I turned to page 98, I surprizingly see a nice 
full page picture of what I believe is P&amp;C white DC.  P or C, check it 
out and confirm.  I know you guys were part of the cruise as I met up 
with you in O'Fallon, IL..   As I turned to page108, I got a big 
surprize.  Weird Load (my '65 bus I wrecked &amp; rolled just a few weeks 
after that pic) is pictured at the bottom of the page with &quot;weird 
load's&quot; rear bumper displaying his name.  Daniel is now sporting the 
center cut &quot;weird load&quot; on his rear bumper of his SC.  What, whose that 
next to WL?  Why it's Cathrine of the famous P&amp;C duo.  Man, Weird Load 
just won't die.  He pops up in the most unusual places or at least parts 
of him does on other buses.  Eventhough we did not have much time 
together, he was a special bus.

Just was excited to see P&amp;C's DC and my Weird Load in the catalog and 
had to tell everyone.  If you can get your hands on a copy of the 
Airheads Catalog, check it out, it's pretty cool.  I'm goiing to have to 
add the DVD of the Herbie Cruise Across America to my Christmas list.  
There may be more Weird Load.  I did cruise with them from Springfield, 
MO to O'fallon, IL.
