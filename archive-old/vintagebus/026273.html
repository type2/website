&gt;     Also I run my 64 with the Sway Away brand front anti sway bar and the rear

&gt; ps.I have been running the KYB GR2's and I'm not sold on them.Too stiff for my
&gt; old body.I'm going back to Boge's, I think.Anybody have any ideas on shocks?

I missed this thread the first go-round...
I run a camber compensator also, and I like it too.

Wood: Where can I get a sway-away front sway bar? Price?

A word about shocks:
KYB is a brand.
GR-2 is their low-end model. Junk, in my mind..
Gas-a-Just is their nice model. Misnamed, they are not adjustable. But
they are SO much nicer than the GR-2's.
Boges are ok if you are running an empty panel or unloaded single or
double, but for any sort of bus with an interior, they are woefully
inadequate ( sp?) in my opinion...

If you have the bread I hear Bilsteins are the real nice ones...
Or if you are Bill Gates you can get some KONI's...
