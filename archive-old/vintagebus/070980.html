Subject: RE: [VB] &quot;Restorations, rebuilds, customs and DNA

If you drill down deep enough, there could never be an 'ultimate' resto.
There will ALWAYS be compromises, but I think that's why we say
'restored' in the first place.  You say to the dude looking at your car
at the show, &quot;This thing here that yer lookin at has utilized all og
parts, correct color, blah blah blah... Its restored as close to its
condition as it left the factory as I could get&quot;.  Or, you could have
said, &quot;I built this thing to represent what a hot rod could have been on
June 15, 1972, all parts are period correct&quot;, or how 'bout &quot;I found a
bunch of pieces and I slapped it together... it's restored to driving
condition&quot;...  If you simply have a plan to build a car with specific
*new* components (i.e. Ronnie) I'd call it a 'custom' or 'driver' or
whatever, since it's not being restored to anything except for it's
capacity to provide reliable daily transportation (no offense Ronnie).

I think we shouldn't get confused to 'maintained with original parts'
and 'restored with original parts' either...

So,

What this means is, there are very few genetically correct resto jobs,
eh?
