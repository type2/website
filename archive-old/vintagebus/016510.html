I think the one that was in your neck of the woods was a '53.  I shoulda
bought that one, but the '54 RHD came up, and well, the rest is history...

&gt; In the latest &quot;vinatge&quot; issue of HVW's there is a red and brown 54' 23 window

&gt; orifinally &quot;found on the east coat in 1997&quot; by Mark Mertz. I know that mark
&gt; buys and sells lots of BD's but this particular bus picques my interest as I
&gt; *think* that this bus may be one that I found in my neck of the woods and that
&gt; mark later bought. Does anyone know the history of this particualr bus in
&gt; question??
