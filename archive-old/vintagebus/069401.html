Subject: FREE Westy Fridge ('66) in NC

Cleaning out the attic while moving, I found an old fridge out of     
ex-roommate's 66 Westy. The drawer is missing, but other than that,   
it's in good shape, and it's free, if you come get it. It's in        
Raleigh, NC. I will NOT ship it, but will hold it on my porch until   
you come get it. First p-mail gets it. Again, you have to come get it.
If it's not gone by Everybus, I'll have it there for some lucky       
person...
