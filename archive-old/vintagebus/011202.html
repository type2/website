&lt;&lt; What are the short- and long-term consequences of overheating? &gt;&gt;

Hi James,
Depends on how much heat and duration.  It is a bit like asking how bad it is 
to eat arsenic/lead.  We all get a little here and there, but no one 
personally wants to increase thier diet of it.  
  To run high temps as a norm is to end up with flat cam lobes and worn 
bearing all too soon.  Making a well built engine that should have gotten 
80,000-100,000 miles lifespan decrease to as little as 30,000 miles.  A 
little higher temps and the valves stretch (Especially the exhaust ones.) and 
stretch till one of them snaps off.  Valve stretch is one reason we prefer 
having non-hydralic valves.  One can get a feel of how the valves are doing 
by how much adjustment they need each 3,000 mile tune up.  If things are 
running right you should most of the time only have to slightly adjust two or 
three of the valves each time.  We had a valve constantly need alot of 
adjustment.  Turned out the push rod had snapped, but kept working for the 
most part while the broken ends kept wearing down!   Way, way too high temps 
result very quickly in one of the aluminuim pistons swelling too much and 
siezing in it's cast iron cylinder.  Usually resulting in that connecting rod 
(or wrist pin) snapping off and getting shoved through the top of the engine 
case!
