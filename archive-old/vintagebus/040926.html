&gt; Any listees going to the Grove?  If so, could we meet somewhere at a
&gt; given time to get together?


As in years past, I will volunteer my stand as a meeting spot, since (if I
get the spot I usually have) it is very centrally located and easy to spot.
When you walk in through the gate and proceed to the end of the entry way
isle, you can either turn left to go to the used vending area or right to go
to the show.  At that &quot;T&quot; junction, my stand will be smack in front of you
(or extremely close to it if for some reason the spot is taken).  Look for
the beige crew cab and the yellow Bus Depot sign.  I will have a TV running,
playing video of busses, so you can look for that too.

I can throw out a suggested time of, say, noon, unless anyone has a
different place/time in mind.  In years past, there have been anywhere from
one to a dozen listees who showed up at the designated meeting time/place,
so you may see someone, or you may not.
