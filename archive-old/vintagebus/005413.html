Thanks to Ted Smith, John Briney, and VeeWee111 for their advice on looking
in the idiot's guide on how to set the shims on the linkpins.  I haven't yet
checked out the guide but I'll have to go dust it off and look into it.  I
use Bentley so much, I fail to see what others have to say.

Oh and yes, as for the chart, the Bentley has it - I can take my
measurements and know exactly how many washers I'll need.  Thanks again and
I'll keep you all posted...
