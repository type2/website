&gt; I realize they're in the business of selling cars.  So is GM, Ford,
&gt; Chrysler/Daimler, Honda, Oldsmobile (RIP).  And as far as I'm
&gt; concerned, they're all on the same level.  I would be better
&gt; off buying a new GM or Ford truck than a new VW - at least I could drag home
&gt; buses with a spankin' new dually.

So true!  Porsche, Mercedes, GM, Ford, Chrysler, etc.  ALL support their OLD cars to some extent.  All big 3 American manufactures see the value...nay the profit in supporting their classic cars.  For example if I'm into 60's Chryslers I can get on the phone
to the FACTORY parts department  and order me up a big block hemi!!  For that fact, you could probably build a mustang from the ground up with factory sanctioned repro parts bought at a dealers parts counter.

Yes, you can still get a new Mexican motor, but that is ending soon.  Go into your local VW parts department and about the only think you might be able to get for an air cooled car are wires and plugs...but don't count on it.  .  Porsche, Mercedes and BMW all
support their older car owner.  Its expensive, but you can STILL get some of the stuff.

The final straw for me was when (like Thom mentioned) VW/AG/OA sent its attack lawyers against hobbyist (via their sites).....absolutely shameful!!!!  VW and Disney, about two of the most shameful companies out there.
