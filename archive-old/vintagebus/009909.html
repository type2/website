The IRS would definately be optimized by the IRS, set up, undoubtedly. The
higher gearing actually lets the type 4 use it's torque potential, and
allows for better fuel mileage.

Using a type 4 with a reduction box set up is something that we do alot, it
is no big deal, and as long as a sane person drives the bus, there are no
adverse affects, however if the clutch is dropped, things will break!

Either way, the type 4 is the way to go, it has alot to do with the
application. I'm installing a 2270cc type 4 into my 62 Deluxe, 15 window,
with reduction boxes....I want to restore it to original, and only update
the engine, so I can always put the 40Horse back in, to sell it...

&gt;Does anyone here have a Wolfgang IRS kit for a split window bus they'd like
&gt;to sell?  I've got a few parts that are worthy of trade but I'm looking to
&gt;buy without the price tag and this is why used is okay.  I like the
&gt;reduction boxes but I like the low maintenance and less potential for leaks
&gt;that you find on a IRS equipped machines.
&gt;
&gt;I would like to hear both sides of the story about converting to IRS and
not
&gt;WHEN USING a T4 2L engine.  I know Scott Fraser will have some comments to
&gt;make...anyone else?
