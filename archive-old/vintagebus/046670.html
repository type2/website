&lt;&lt; I offered both a nice 64 sundial and a nice 62 singlecab to the list both 
 priced under 1000$ bucks......no takers.
 People can kick themselves later. &gt;&gt;
While  we're talking about sundials for under $1,000 any one want a velvet 
green 65? At least I think its a sundial. It has a couple of primer spots, 
different colour decklid. broken lower p-side door hinge. comes with a camper 
bed and closet. but they arey modified westy. lip cut off the wells. solid 
bus, rust through only in one side of the front floor(can't remeber which) 
Not a perfect bus, but decent. no motor. $750 obo. 
I bought it off a lady a in november because she needed the flow, and never 
brought it home. It's still at her house. I actually forgot about it until I 
read this post. I've got a title for it though.
