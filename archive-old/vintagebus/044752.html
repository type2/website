Hey Matthew---

As far as the clips go, a conversation with fellow listmember and midwest man 
Woody earlier this week enlightened me that the clips being sold as bus clips 
are actually bug panel clips. I think they're a PITA because they are 1/8 to 
1/16 of an inch too short (I think this what you told me Woody). They take 
alot of work to be good working. As far as optins go, I'm really not sure 
(this might be a part you could get at an older dealer? but you might want to 
make sure the part# starts w/ a 2 for the bus clips). Other than that, you 
could get an earlier bus with the screw in panels:)

Let me know your findings of the corner interior piece!

Hope this helps a bit--
