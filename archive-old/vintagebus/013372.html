&gt; Can anyone help me? I was at the classic in Irvine last month and saw a 
&gt; booth  for a company in California that does a beaut job of restoring 
&gt; steering wheels, and for a decent price too. I had picked up their card but 
&gt; now that I'm back home I can't find it. If you can get me some info on that 
&gt; company or any other that does a good job of steering wheels, that would be 
&gt; appreciated.
