&lt;&lt; i am running a 71 universal case, doghouse, 20-50 highrev valvoline, 2 
relief pistons and a schadek late pump; in the past, the oil pressure at 
startup would go to around 95 or so, and come down to 60 at high rpm after 3 
or 4 mins (15-30 at idle).&gt;&gt;

Hi Craig,
First replace the 20-50 Wt. oil with either 30 or perhaps 10/30 Wt. for the 
cold weather especially below 50F.  We tried 20-50 Wt. Castrol oil and found 
it acted more like 40 Wt. in the dual relief engines!  Are you running a 
thermostatic flaps system?  If not get one.  Check the 1968-71 bus Official 
Service manual for proper relief springs length for your year late model 
engine.    Eric&amp;Barb
