Subject: aussie two taillights 61&amp;back M33
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

perusing an M code list there is M 33  which is

with additional rear flashing indicators (up to chassis # 802 985 only) types 211-274  Italy, Australia

which means it was italy&amp;Aussie spec to have the extra round taillight so there was a separate turn signal in back, like that thread that was around a bit ago.  So for those w/ buses like that, check yr M codes tags, there may well be M 33 on it.
