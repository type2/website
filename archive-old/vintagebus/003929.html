Hi again...

I do have a problem with my DC.  There's a '67 tranny and RGB's on there,
but I can't get it to go up my driveway, which is very steep and has two
tight, steep curves which can be sorta slimy this time of year.  The angle
of the curves, combined with the steepness make one of two bad things
happen:  1.  The whole vehicle jerks and jumps alarmingly  2.  The tyres
spin LOTS more than they should.  It's almost as if the front brakes are on!
(I'll be checking that ASAP!)

The tyres are OK...they're truck tyres (square-ish edges) with plenty of
tread...

When I drove Clara ('66 Westy) up the same driveway, it was dry, but she did
have a little trouble with it.  How do I alleviate this problem without
going IRS?

Please help!  Thanks!
