Oilless compressors suck you bad you can feel it.  Avoid them at all
costs.  I wouldn't take one if you gave it to me for free.  I threw a
rod on one, the devilbiss version.

Campbell Hausfeld (sp) has a halfway decent upright compressor.  DOn't
recall the exact spec, but a friend got one at HF.  I think it's 60gal.
It's two-stage, and it's probably in the 12cfm_at_90 class, probbaly a little
more.  Ingersoll Rand is another good brand, if you're long on bread.

Get the biggest compressor you can afford.
