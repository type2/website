&lt;&lt; Has anyone out there considered converting a trans to a berg 5 speed? 
keeping 
 gearing close to stock but having a 5th gear for the highway.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Discncerter,
We found that with the stock gearing being so short you had to just shift so 
fast!  With the 5th gear tranny it would be the same but another gear to ave 
to shift to.  With the freeway flier the gears are much easier due to being 
magnified to cover more MPH for the same RPMs.  That plus being about 1/4 the 
cost of the 5th gear tranny!  Eric&amp;Barb
