&gt; Has anyone had first hand experience with the fog lights mentioned at thom's
&gt; site (vintagebus_dot_com) the direct link is ..
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.rinto_dot_com/Unity/unityfog.htm
&gt; 
&gt; any idea who the actual manufacturer of the lights is??

I researched this info and gave it to Thom when he was looking.  I
discovered them on our friend Ebay.  There was two sellers in different
parts of the country butting them up for bid and the pages looked pretty
similar.  Nah, not a scam, not on Ebay.  Anyway after this search I found
the the manufacture, Unity.  UNITY, an innovative manufacturer of
professional quality lighting products for over 70 years.  They make lights
for police cars and emergency vehicles.  This is their page for my pick for
great lights for Splitz.  Hey, we could buy a bunch and put them on Ebay.

Cheers, John
