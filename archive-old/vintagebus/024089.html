Well, I had a breakdown on the way to busses by the arch, luckily I was
still in front of my house in Minneapolis! It turns out that one of the
arms on the clutch/throwout bearing operating broke off leaving me with
no clutch and a horrible grinding sound. The next day I pulled the
engine all by myself with the aid of a jack, 2x4 and a skateboard.  I'm
replacing the clutch, pressure plate, control arm, bearing and tranny
seal. Any other &quot;Must do's&quot; while the engine is on the bench? Also, what
is the best spline lube? Any helpful hints for re installing?
