That was his idea from the beginning. I suggested swapping the bodies

because I was unsure of how much it entailed. Nw that I see this isn't as

feasible as , per say, a type 1, we will go back to his idea.

 - ---  --
I would take a good look at the body to see which is easier.  And then again, 
seeing as he is planning a 5 year resto etc, might as well do it right.

&lt;&lt;gets this ratty samba&gt;&gt;


Ratty? Since when is any vintage VW considered Ratty? and there is that

Samba again. Based on the responses I got, thsi is wrong, correct?
-  -- - - 
thought samba is thosedeluxe buses with the extra holes in the roof- those 
skylight windows.  Well the bus sounds ratty to me.  Dont worry, im not 
putting the bus down.  I have a ratty 61 hardtop deluxe.  When I swappped out 
of it at Kelley Park (In Ca, 850 miles from home) people kept trying to buy 
pieces off it as I guess it looked so ratty that It must be getting parted 
out or something.   There are lots of ratty buses.  


&lt;&lt;and even though you dont

like bodywork,  you are willing to do all this cut and weld?  &gt;&gt;


I hate bodywork. I despise bodywork. lol. But, there are no limitations to

what I would do for a friend.

- - - -  -
maybe your friend should learn bodywork.  AFter all, it is his bus. And  
Learning bis bodies is differentthat bgs.  I have only the haziest idea of 
bug bodies, but have a good idea of buses bodies, though more from diassembly 
-  as I can take pieces off dead buses so they can be reused, but dont have 
the welding skills and confidence.  Nor paint.  dont want to do actual paint 
anyway, it smells bad and gives me a headache.  but you have to do it to 
learn it.
