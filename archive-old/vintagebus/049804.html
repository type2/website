Subject: Installing my heater cable?
Message-Id: &lt;v03110701b31f7d0d5fea_at_[38.28.68.81]&gt;

I know this is a rather redundant question but I never seem to just see a
straight out &quot;how to answer&quot; when someone asks &quot;How do I install my heater
cable?&quot; So I finaly bought a cable for my 64 and now Im ready to put it in
but with no existing cable in place I just don't have a clue as to how it
goes.

	I know that there are two switches (flaps) on the heat box's
because I perminatly wired em open for the winter but now being spring Im
starting to get just a little stuffy driving home from work on a nice sunny
afternoon.
	I would have guessed that the cable would have to &quot;Y&quot; at some point
to be able to pull both levers at the same time but the cable I got is just
one long cable with metal things on either end how dose it controll both
box's??

Thanks for any help!
I did try to find this info on the archive first but I still feel a little
in the dark. :-)
