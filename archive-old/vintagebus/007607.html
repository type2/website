Hey, anybody know how make some sort of contraption so you can rip the
suspension out or your bus and still be able to move it around? I've got a
pair of big castors , but I can't figure out what the best way to mount them
to the bus would be. Any ideas? I'd prefer it to be as simple as possible
too.
