&lt;&lt; ANyone ever heard of a pre-68 tranny with an overdrive?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
The word overdrive means in essence that the gearing of the tranny, rear end 
(Ring and pinion), and any other subsequent gearing turns the RPMs being 
produced by the engine to higher RPMs at the drive wheels.  This gearing is 
in stock non-mountian bus trannies from 1960-67.  We have a 1963 panel with 
an official gearing sticker on the dash.  With reverse, first, second, third, 
and OVERDRIVE diagram positions shown!  
  Does anyone else have any official VW stickers (Other than the valve lash 
on the fanshroud, and the 12 volt sticker on the drivers dashside.) on thier 
dash or elsewhere?   Eric&amp;Barb
