&gt; flywheel? Doesn't this decide the clutch size too? 

&lt;&lt;Not necessarily, as there were 200 mm 6v flywheels in buses, 180mm 6v
flywheels in bugs, and 200mm 12v flywheels in both.&gt;&gt;

Could a 200mm clutch be installed by mistake with a 180mm flywheel?
If not, I know the flywheel is 200mm. 

Now for the flywheel tooth count, would 109 teeth be correct for my 6 volt
starter?

Thanks you guys,
