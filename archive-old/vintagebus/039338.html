E-bay might be a wonderful way to supplement your income, or to locate that 
rare bit you need to make your seat rails show quality perfect so you can 
sell your bus for $45k.  However, I believe the majority of us read the 
lists to glean bits of knowledge to help us keep our buses running, learn 
from each others errors, and participate in the cameraderie and networking 
to be found here.

At least that's why I read the lists.  I have learned much since I started 
reading and have applied that knowledge to keep not only my own buses 
running, but also have helped others, either on the lists or in person with 
wrench in hand.

Maybe those with an interest in E-bay could persuade the list admins to 
create a bus-bay list so those that care can post and read e-bay stuff 
pertaining to buses and so leave relevant bus related bandwidth for bus 
people.

It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly 
how much power the  President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic  President 
was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.
