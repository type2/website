Hi Joe,
All the insurance companies we tried had way too much restriction on milage 
per year to let us go just to Sacramento from the Seattle area and back.  
Plus you had to move all your other driver cars to the same insurance 
company.  In the end the total cost was higher than just insuring all of them 
non-vintage with State Farm.
