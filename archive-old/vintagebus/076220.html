Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter thingy bolt size?

Here is a picture of it. You need to use this kind of fastener because it
has the pointed end that engages the shift rod.

I was attempting to put my gear shifter on today and I canna seem to find
the
bolts.  As I recall I had them dangling from fishing line over a rope when I
painted em a couple of months ago - now - no where to be found.  What size
of
bolts should they be.  I found two in a baggie but they seem a bit long -
like
over an inch.  Could they be the ones?  How long are those two bolts
supposed
to be - and are they both exactly the same length or is one ... maybe 1/8&quot;
longer?  I'm inquiring about the shifter in my 60.
