Subject: spotting - navy 2s
Date: Sat, 22 Jan 2000 22:45:13 -0800

i work on a navy base.  i see a type 2 about twice a year and a split window
about once every two years on base.  typically my volkswagens share the lots
with $port$ car$, $.u.v. and other high-end car$.  while my beetles are
pretty nice to look at, my single cab truck is certainly not the mostly
attractive of vehicles and looks mightily out of place on base.  so imagine
my surprise when going out to retrieve something i'd left at the truck and
there parked right behind it was a sub-hatch camper!  i grinned the whole
way there and back and told everyone in the office about how there was an
old volkswagen bus parked right there with my truck.  later i went out and
left my business card with a note thanking the driver for parking his camper
with my truck.  it belongs to one of the military guys new to this area.  he
was eager to learn about the local vw scene which isn't all that active
around here; the few of us there are band together like endangered species.
i gave him some good info, contact numbers and we are planning to caravan to
shows.

cheers,
