Hooked &amp; reeled in!!

Predecessor generation?  Hmmm  Makin' me feel old.  I agree that there's
folks out there never been to a show, seen the Terrapin Express, or
could even name the first keyboard player.  Yes, clothing styles can
border on the ridiculous, but priced a pair of new bell bottoms lately? 
My daughter wants a pair in the worst way.  I too like busses for what
they are and not because they're 'kewwel' or anything like that.  I
prefer the simple to the complex.

My bus, in the year I've owned it, has become practical (almost)
reliable transportation that makes me grin when I drive it.  No other
vehicle (4+ wheeled) does that to me.  Screw the chic bourgeois in style
bullshit.  I owned a Hardley once and will &lt;NEVER&gt; own one again.  My
motorcycles are both BMWs, a 1976 daily rider and a 1964 that's resting
until I get the hell outta Miami.  Look at the aircooled BMW engine -
remind you of something?  No wonder I like my old aircooled underpowered
rolling brick that I call the Tinkertoy.  It's like riding my '64 - plan
way ahead for stopping, stay outta the madness that others generate when
they're behind the wheel, and enjoy the right now for the experience. 
Others sometimes ask me why I ride dinosaurs when I can afford new &amp;
shiny high tech.  If you have to ask, you won't understand.  Busses are
like that for me too.


Yes Tony, I'm a bass player too though nowhere near as accomplished as
phil.  If he doesn't wanna sell off his basses think he'd at least leave
one to you and me to play in his memory?  
Stave: I've always wondered why the 'public' gets so into celebrities
private affairs.  I used to want to be rich and famous.  As I've looked,
I sure don't wanna be famous because all of a sudden it'll be important
to the media and some folks what kinda toilet paper I use.  As far as
rich goes, Uncle Sam'll want much of it and the rest of the world'll
want a piece of my pie.  Much better to be broke and unknown and live a
joyous life.  I feel sorry for phil, Bob and the guys because they don't
have the freedom to live their lives.

So if I offended any you, my apologies.  It's Friday and I feel
philosophical and a tad playful.

Dave
