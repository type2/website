Clara,

I stand and supervise. When the pimple faced kid cant get the
church'key  door open for the gas, I offer to do it for him. Them I
instruct him in very specific terms exactly how I want him to fill the
tank. If he is not willing to do it right, for example, if he needs to
leave it on super-high auto shut-down mode ( read: spill over the side
mode) then I insist on doing it myself, regardless of the law. There are
many stations who know me around here, and let me pump my gas, as long
as I do it with the gas-side away from teh street, so they don't get a
ticket from the fire-marshall.
All in all , it is one of a very few things that I dislike about Oregon.


I know that they always let motorcyclists fill themsleves. The gas tank
is in just too close proximity to the rider's crotch.


Are there any other states where you are not allowed to fill your own
gas?
