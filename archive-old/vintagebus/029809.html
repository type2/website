I keep reading about the dire results of overtightening the NPT to JIC
adapter when installing a full flow system.  The thought came to
mind...  Why not use an o-ring adapter rather than a NPT one?  The
o-ring fitting uses a straight thread with a jam nut and an o-ring to
seal it rather than the tapered thread of NPT.  The boss appears to
have sufficient surface area to provide a seal.  Has anyone ever tried it?

Just curious...
