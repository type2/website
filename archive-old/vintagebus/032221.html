I've also seen people with plates that should have been blue with yellow or
even white with blue painted black with yellow! Yeesh, that's pushing
things a bit far in my book.

&gt;If anyone wants an explanation of the *California* YOM rules, lemme know.
My main advice which probably holds true in any state is don't go in to DMV
looking to do this until you know the whole scoop. I've had DMV elves try
to take my plates away from me, say they had to be destroyed, tell me it
can't be done...etc. It was only my arcane knowledge that saved my plates
from the blast furnace.
