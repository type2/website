&gt; &gt; Does Anyone have any ideas to how I can get a pulley to run the
&gt; &gt; compressor?  I would love to get the AC working.

Well, one way would be to get two aluminum aftermarket pulleys and have a
machine shop remove the center of one, then make a spacer to allow you to
bolt the two pulleys together.

It might be more practical to scrounge up a dual pulley from a bug AC
addon kit.

I wouldn't try to run an ac compressor from the single belt.  The cooling
fan is already a fairly heavy power draw, and I wouldn't want to abuse
that belt!
