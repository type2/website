&gt; You were luck to find one,
&gt; they are getting harder and harder to find, along with the bug autostick
&gt; tranny. Please don't confuse the bus aurostick with the bug. 
&gt; 
&gt; Several other VW's also came with the &quot;autostick&quot; starter, but finding 
&gt; Things in the bone yards is pretty rare.  But your odds get better if you 
&gt; know where any of the dreaded Type 4's ( 411-412 ) automatics are stashed.  
&gt; Same starter and most Volks Folks never give these ugly little cars a 
&gt; second look.
