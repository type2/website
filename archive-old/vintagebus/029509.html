Subject: Should I buy a Bentley manual?

Wondering what your opinions are on the worth of this manual in general
-- for people who've owned vintage busses before.  I'm probably gonna
get one eventually, but considering:

- I've got Haynes, Cl*mer, M*ir, and even a couple of others, so the
mechanicals are covered, albeit unevenly (the Cl*mer Bus book has more
inaccuracies and downright stupidisms than you can shake a stick at)
- The engine section won't be news, and how much more do I need to know
about the electrical system?
- this is for a standard (so no special components to mess with, like a
sunroof)

..in such case, what's your take?  I have the BBB for 61-65 Type 1's and
it was of some use when I redid the top on my Ghia -- ie, I know they're
comprehensive and authoritative books -- but I'm just curious what else
I might expect to find in this $60+ tome.

Thanks,
Joe
