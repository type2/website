That's the thing, you put lots and lots of that chem on your bus but main
question is: is it gonna get all the paint off? you'll miss all the &quot;hard to
reach&quot; places (corners, edges), you'll have to sand some areas anyway,
you'll have to spend hours and hours of pouring layers and layers of
stripper, this stuff is just for someone that wants let's say one piece done
(i.e. fender, door) but not the whole thing. I'd prefer to spend the extra
dollar and do it right the first time. Sandblast is the way to go.... if
your finances will permit.

My opinion...... only.

Andre

&gt; Or, you can just sand and sand and sand.  Chemicals work fast, but it will
&gt; take a lot of time and luck to get them all neutralized.  I have avery sad
&gt; story from a guy on the Porsche list who had an early speedster dipped -
it
&gt; literally ruined the car.
