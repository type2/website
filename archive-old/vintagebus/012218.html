Hi all,
You wrote...


&gt;In our constant effort to improve on perfection (yea right...), I 
noticed
&gt;the gap between the pipe that runs thru the heater boxes and the heater
&gt;boxes themselves.  I think, &quot;I bet that sucks cold air in thru there 
or, at
&gt;least, blows hot air out&quot;.  So...I cranked the heat way down on my MIG
&gt;welder and zigged a bead around the pipe to heater box contact area on 
both


The very first bus I bought was sold to me by a welder. He hadn't really 
used his skills on the bus, he was into underwater bridge welding and 
other exotic stuff. But when I bought this bus I took the heater boxes 
off and showed him how loose they were on the j tube. He took both and 
welded all the gaps closed (except for where the water comes out. He 
even cut out part of the side and welded in a new piece on one cause 
there was some rust developing. Great work, these boxes were with me a 
long time.

On another note, one time I was having a hell of a time lining up some 
crummy exhaust extractor to an engine. A friends uncle comes outside to 
see what we were up to. After the obligatory rant about what peices of 
crap VW's are, he took a rope and tied it around the extracter pipes. 
Then he put a wrench on the rope and twisted it, tightening the rope, 
pulling the tubes inward. The pipes went right on.
