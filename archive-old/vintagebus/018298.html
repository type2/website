As an aside, the barndoor deluxe that Ronnie just dragged home was
originally *yellow*.

&gt; To your original question historically a &quot;Samba&quot; or &quot;Sondermodel&quot; in
&gt; German refers to the Special Deluxe model bus 23 windows, Sealing Wax
&gt; Red lower half and Chestnut Brown upper half, 51-58 model year only.
&gt; These are the true &quot;sambas&quot; as the factory has described. After 58 the
&gt; factory stopped using this term and color scheme. People have since
&gt; referred to all deluxes as such and I'm sure some will say any split bus
&gt; is a &quot;samba.&quot;
