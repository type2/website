Hi,
Definitely get the aluminuim shift extender.  Having that in steel and/or a 
heavy aftermarket knob does ruin the tranny shifting due to the added wieght 
pulling at the top of the shifter.  The same goes for the ignition switch.  
It is best to only have a single key with a small fob dangling from the 
ignition, or the switch will wear out faster the more wieght swinging from 
it.  To demostrate this for yourself try wearing a bowling ball as a earring 
on one side of your head and see what it does for your neck in a couple of 
days.
