&gt; That would be a sweet bus to swap out of, but for $10.5k, you'd have to
&gt; sell a LOT of superbeetle taillights to recoup the green.

    Yeah, but can't you see Frank Konisky or Uncle Jerry Jess selling tons of
V-dub toys out of one....&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

    If I had the green to buy it, It would be mine in a second...

    I've actually found a Baywindow panel with the vending door on the driver's
side up in VT.  It used to be a Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice cream truck...  Still all done
up in their paint scheme (Blue sky, white puffy clouds, and COWS).  Would
probably have to repaint the Bus to avoid any legal complications.
