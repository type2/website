Subject: Reduction box bearings
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I have a 66 os-42 that I got for cheap because of a
bad transaxle. After disassembling the reduction boxes
I have found that one of the inner bearings of the
driven gear shaft is bad.  The question is what are
the chances of the soft plug behind the bearing
getting buggered up when I press the thing out.  If
said plug does get buggered, are they easily found or
will it be easer to just get a good reduction
gear/tunnel assembly.

                   Thanks 
                   Doug
