Subject: Is a camper a Modified Bus?

&gt;2001 Kelley Park
&gt;&quot;We are eliminating the modified classes and will no
&gt;longer have awards for these classes...


A question for those of you who help develop car shows.

Is a camper conversion such as Westy, Sundial, Riverara and others
classified as modified since the factory did not do the modifications?
