                      Painting by Moonlight


For three years Grendel has sat out behind the shop while I've
chiseled and scraped, slowly replacing her rotted rusty panels
with good stuff, kicking out the major dents, fiddling with this
&amp; that.  In my resurrection of Grendel I've chosen to follow an
unorthodox path.
 
Grendel is not a full-time project nor even a full-dollar project
because I'm hoping to explore and define the lowest common
denominator of methods one might use to restore an old
Volkswagen.  The manuals insist things can be done only one way,
or at least, within a vary narrow window of accepted ways.  I'm
hoping to open that window a little wider, to see if I can
discover some techniques that produce acceptable results without
the need for a lot of equipment or money.

One of my experiments has been with brazing instead of welding. 
I've spent a lot of time messing up perfectly good repair panels,
experimenting with high-strength eutectic solders -- nickel
brazing alloys for the most part, stronger than the steel being
joined.  Expensive, but a method that does away with the usual
welding torch.  And they worked fine... if you already knew how
to weld.  So it was back to square one.

(Your best welding rig remains an acetylene torch.  Miggers are
fast &amp; easy... and expensive.  But when it comes to panel work,
you'll probably find a basic torch is more versatile.)

Painting has been a real challenge.  Knowing a lot of you don't
have air-compressors I've been experimenting with a $25 HVLP gun
from Harbor Freight (P/N P-32215).  They say you can use an
industrial vacuum-cleaner as your air source.  They're about half
right :-)  I'm trying to improve on that by building a low-cost
HVLP compressor using an old VW blower and parts of a 40hp blower
housing.  This is a 'work-in-progress' but so far, progress has
been good.

I'm also experimenting with low-cost paint.  Hoping to keep the
cost down, I tried bulk-canned Rustoleum but the results were
pretty awful and the stuff cost nearly $40 a gallon at Home
Depot.  Shopping around, I discovered the local NAPA dealer can
order professional-grade automotive paint.  It's a synthetic
enamel made by Western Automotive Finishes.  Durable, good color-
matching, not too difficult to apply and not too toxic, all for
about thirty bucks a gallon.  This is another work-in-progress --
so far, I've only used Western's primer.  Works okay, but the
lack of controls on the cheap HVLP gun forces you to adjust both
viscosity and volatility in the paint, a task some may find too
troublesome.

But a word of caution...  While your NAPA dealer can order you
the paint, they can't offer you any advice on doing the job.  Too
many potential legal liabilities.  That's the gulf I've been
trying to bridge, trying to come up with a relatively fool-proof
set of instructions so any veeduber can do a fair good paint job. 
So far, I've accumulated a bale of notes, some of which might
make sense one day.

When using a high-volume, low-pressure spray-gun the painting
itself goes fairly fast... assuming the breeze is fairly slow. 
Low-pressure means there isn't a lot of energy in the delivered
spray of paint.  If there's any breeze at all, you're going to
have trouble.  Painting outside, you need to plan ahead, wait
until the wind dies away, jump in and paint like mad.

Where I live (within sight of the Pacific Ocean) the wind goes
dead-calm twice a day, once just after sunrise and again just
before sunset.  I can't take advantage of the morning calm.  The
temperature is a bit too low and there's usually some dew that
has to be dealt with.  In the mornings, by the time I'm ready to
paint, the breeze is ready to blow.

But evenings are nice.

The moon will be full tomorrow, meaning it rose 53 minutes before
sunset today, just as the breeze died away.  As things fell
perfectly quiet and still, I began to paint, racing the fading
light as much as the return of the breeze.  I knew I could do
only a small section but as insurance I'd mixed about twice that
much paint.  

As I neared the end of the pre-planned area I realized I was
having no trouble seeing the flow-line.  The moon had risen high
enough for its reflection in the fresh paint to tell me I was
accurately blending each new pass with the one before.

The light bled out of the sky as the clouds offshore gobbled up
the sun but I continued to paint by the light of the moon. 
Because of the low angle of the moon and the orientation of the
roof panel, I could catch a very nice reflection as the wet paint
sprayed onto the surface, pass after pass after pass.  

The gun finally ran dry about the time the coyotes started to sing
across the canyon, but not until I'd covered nearly twice the area 
I'd planned to do.  And provided my neighbors with yet more evidence 
veedubers are some mighty strange folk :-)

So here's a trick to you add to your warbag:  If you've got the
right angle, you can paint by the light of the moon.
