Have Eric and Barb ever owned a 54 bus?  My 54 was coated with tar on the entire rear floor, walls, and the drivers side of the engine compartment.  It probably saved the bus, although the plywood floor did help keep enough water there to do some rusting.  It is a pain to get off, so I may just leave it there behind the door panels.  I am trying to get it all off of the engine compartment.  Anyone have any better ideas than a razor blade and laquer thiner?

Thanks,
Richard

 Eric and Barb probably have some 
solution with tar...good luck.  &gt;&gt;
 We do like to coat with tar the inner bottom half of the front 
doors to repel rust formation.    Eric&amp;Barb
