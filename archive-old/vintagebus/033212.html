GEEEEZ, if you saw that bus, that means you were directly across the aisle
&gt;from us.  NOBODY stopped to say hello to us.  After all my writing about what
a nice family we all are   BOO HOO.  I'm still no closer now to knowing
anyone from this list than before the meet.  I'm so bummed.
Maybe we'll see you all at another meet somewhere up here in the Pacific
NorthWest.  Or at the Classic.  Or at Bad Camberg.  Oh well, why am I
Bit**ing?  I guess i'll have more opportunities to meet yous guys.
