Am I nuts, or does evey VW owner gather more stuff then they can use? I 
have 10 or so heater boxes, bug and bus style (yes all nothing special) 
tin parts like crazy, fan shrouds (about 5 or more non doghouse and no 
not 36hp, although I know where to get a nice one). Misc. generator 
stands and oil fillers.

Is there any value or is it all just old stuff? Nothing vintage or 
special, just old vw motor stuff taking up space. Should I try and sell 
it or just scrap it?

Yes, it seem that every VW owner gathers up spare stuff.   It probably has
some minor value, but no big deal.  Why not post where you are and say come
and get it- must take all, or put an ad up at your loal VW shop- some other
bus head might come take the load off your hands.   Repro tin is junk,
sometimes a piece of tin is needed.  Heater boxes rust and leak, good heater
boxes are good to have.     Pull out what you want as spares, and unload the
rest on someone else- but don't scrap it
