Subject: Rancho tranny?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'll be in the market for a new tranny as mine (big  nut) is getting louder 
by the day...
I've got a stock 1600 dp...
What kind of gearing would be best for me? I don't think freeway flier would 
be my best bet...
Also, do they sell them complete? What kind of cash am I looking at?
Thanks alot,
Pete
