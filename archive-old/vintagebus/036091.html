&gt; Hi David,
&gt;  
&gt;  Why do you need a new steering box?  They are adjustable for wear.  (68 - 
72
&gt;  worm and peg).  Chapter 2, pg 31 in the Bentley manual.  If, after 
&gt; adjustment,
&gt;  90 wt gear lube leaves it loose, try 140 wt or a good steering lube grease 
&gt; to
&gt;  &quot;adjust&quot; the play.
&gt;  
&gt;  Keep smiling,

Hi folks,

now I don't wish to start a flame war but I think the above is realy poor 
advice. Using a thicker oil/grease to compensate for wear is not a good 
idea....

A friend of mine used to have a split screen van, the king pins were worn so 
just before the annual inspection he packed them with the heaviest grease he 
could find and the van passed with no excessive play in the king pins.
A month or two later his wife rolled the van as the king pin collapsed in a 
corner.

However you make your own choice as to how dangerous a ride you want to have 
but remember that the person who gets injured as your van careers accross the 
road refusing to respond to the steering wheel may not be you.

Good luck
