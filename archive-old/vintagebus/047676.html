&gt;  So about 2 weeks ago I thought I felt my bus kinda dragging, as if the
&gt;  emergency brake was on.  I thought that maybe I was imagining it so I drove
&gt;  off.  I noticed this a couple of times since.  Today I noticed that my
&gt;  emergency brake was not holding very well when I was parked on a slight
&gt;  incline and I adjusted my brakes and had everything working very well about
&gt;  500 to 1000 miles ago.  I'm thinking that maybe there is some sort of crap
&gt;  in the tubes that my emergency brake cables ride in and   that I ought to
&gt;  try and cleam em out.  Does this seem reasonable?  Could there be some 
other
&gt;  cause for my emergency brake going from grabbing really well at the second
&gt;  click to hardly grabbing at all at the second last click. I suspect that
&gt;  these emergency brake cables have been in my bus since 1960 so I guess I
&gt;  better just replace em.

yes- your back brakes could be dragging for other reasons, like bad springs 
or old fles lines.   to check, park the bus , jack up the back end,   spin a 
wheel.  pull the ebrake and let it off- any difference before or after.  do 
the same with the foot brake.  put it back on the ground, undo the rear axle 
nut, and inspect it in there.

ps older e brakes have zerk fittings so you can lube them.  grease is your 
friend
