&lt;&lt; 1500 stock air cleaner &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Well we are running a 1641cc engine in a 1960 panel camper with a 40 HP air
cleaner and stock 1600cc muffler.  57 pilot, 117ish main jet, and 130 air
correction jet and am thinking of trying a 135 air correction jet to let in a
little more air at higher speed to lean it out just a little more.  Since you
are running a slightly smaller engine and larger better breathing air cleaner
(Do you have a pre-1968 bus and stock 1600cc bus muffler? you might have to
use a slightly larger pilot and main jet.  Then maybe using either the 130 or
135 air correction jet.  Please keep us informed on how this works out for
you.  Thanks,  Eric&amp;Barb
