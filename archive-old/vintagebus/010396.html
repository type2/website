Those of you contemplating a T4 engine in your bus or bug may want to save
this message.  This morning over breaktime at work, I sat down with Joe
Cali's plans and wrote down a list of basics that I would need in order to
do the conversion and here is what I came up with:

2L crank and rods, hydraulic cam and lifters, and on transmissions without
the sleeve for the release bearing, a special KEP flywheel (for use on my
bus.)

Type 1 pulley with I.D. enlarged and hub turned down in order to accept the
T4 pulley hub.  This is bolted to the T1 pulley.  No big deal here.

Modify the ALT stand from a T1 (cut it down) and then weld it to an aluminum
block via plans to bolt down oh the T4 breather area.

Remove studs from T1 oil cooler adaptor, block off stock T1 oil flow holes
in adaptor and drill 2 new holes into the adaptor to accept brass barb
fittings (or fittings of your choice)  Use oil cooler bypass adaptor (I
think the T1 ones will work) to route oil to the relocated cooler.

Modifications to the stock 36HP fan shroud are extensive enough (IMHO) to
necessitate buying an aftermarket 36HP shroud with the doghouse oil cooler
tinwork installed.  Also getting it with airflaps would be a nice plus.

Form sheet metal ducting around the oil cooler on the shroud IF you are
going to attempt to modify it yourself.  I would think aluminum trim coil
and pop rivets could be used but trim coil does dent easy.

For oil cooling problems or hi-performance applications, get sandwich plate
adaptor that goes between oil filter and case so oil can also be routed  to
external cooler and then back into the engine.

Modify the oil cooler exhaust to go through a 3&quot; hot air heat riser tube.
Using the stock T1 method will render the #3 spark plug inaccessible.

Modify the airflap actuator rod on the shroud.  (Involves shortening the rod
somewhat)

From scratch, make your own thermostat actuator rod.

Make thermostat bracket adaptor

Modify 4 of the upper cylinder tin from a T4 engine.  Cut them in half and
weld the #3 sections to the #1 sections - sectioning out enough material to
accept the shroud.

Make passenger side and driver's side lower airducts from scratch (I would
use some heeavy sheetmetal for this.)

Make sectioned tin pieces to mate the 1 &amp; 3 cylinder tins to the shroud
itself.

Make engine support bracket that fits engine support holes.

050 or 009 dizzy suggested.  009 is a &quot;safer dizzy&quot; with retard on #3 and
contributes to cooler running engine

In order to mate a T4 to a 67 and newer beetle trans (66 on down on
suggested due to strength concerns), you have to order a KEP adaptor
flywheel.  It has to do with the pressure plate, flywheel, and the throwout
bearing sleeve that only appears on later trannies.  It is suggested to put
swingaxle guts in a 71 or 72 beetle trans so you have this metal sleeve and
can use existing VW parts.  I'll be forced to go with a KEP modified
flywheel.

That about does it.  All in all, this is a conversion that requires some
drilling, tapping, cutting but it's stuff I've done before and it doesn't
scare me.  I think I'll do more pop-riveting instead of welding this time -
choosing to really scrimp so as to keep this on budget.  I firmly believe I
can have a lot of fun a reliability without shoveling out big bucks like I
did on my oil leaker 1776.
