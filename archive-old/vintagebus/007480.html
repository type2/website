Subject: Re: [VB] Shift Rod Coupler

&gt; Hi- On my 61 standard bus I was going to replace the shift rod guide
&gt; bushing (or sleeve).  When I tried to undo the coupler with the two
&gt; square headed screws, one of the square heads was broken off, I guess by
&gt; a PO.  After struggling to loosen the other square headed screw I had the
&gt; great pleasure of breaking it off as well.  (It was a team effort between
&gt; me and the PO =o).  So my question is, where do I go from here?  Is there
&gt; some way to get the broken pieces of screw out or have they permanently
&gt; welded themselves to the shift rod?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

A Dremel with a cutoff wheel can cut a screwdriver slot in the remaining
bolt. With the addition of a good non-WD40 penetrating oil, the vibration
and heat generated will usually allow you to back them out with a
fingernail. If not, try a screwdriver. Hope this helps.
