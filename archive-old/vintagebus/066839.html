&gt;
&gt;If you are closer to the front of the line be more aware of the 
&gt;lights/opposing traffic and before it changes push the clutch pedal
&gt;down and shift into gear.

I think US traffic light sequencing is a conspiracy by General Motors
to sell more cars with automatic transmission.  Green-yellow-red-green-
yellow-red doesn't give you any clue when to shift into gear.  In
Germany the lights change green-yellow-red-red+yellow-green - the
yellow light comes on for about one second with the red light, then
both yellow and red go out and green comes on.  That second gives you
time to get on the clutch, get in gear, and be ready to go as soon as
the green comes on.  In the US you have to sit there and shift like mad
as soon as the light turns green, and hope that the lady behind you in
the Escalade who is combing her hair, putting on make-up, talking on
the phone, and driving (in that order) notices that you haven't started
moving right away.
