 Missed the first 100 posts, why do we need hot water for air cooled buses?
Clean all my stuff with cold Castrol  Super Clean parts cleaner, works
great.

 Rec camper windows from Thom Friday. Just as described and fair priced.
Thanks, Thom.

  Sold the 57 DD Panel and also sold the 66 walkthru kombi today. I'm
busless for the 1st time in years, need a fix ASAP.
