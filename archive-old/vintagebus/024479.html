Lately there has been a significant amount of traffic about the
unresponsiveness of the Bus Depot.  Having never done business with Ron, I
can't really offer a valid opinion.  However, there are alternatives.  I HAVE
done business with Jim Thompson at Old Volks Home and have had nothing but
fast accurate service.  You might check it out.
