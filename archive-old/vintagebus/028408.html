Subject: Wolfsburg employee watch ??

Has anyone seen one of these before? I know of one in an antique shop,
and would like to buy it. I'm quite convinced that it is authentic, but
have no idea of the value or rarity. If people are buying NOS Wolfsburg
dirt, I suppose this watch is worth a kazillion dollars!!!
  The watch has typical 60's? design. On the face, where it would say
the manufacturer's name, it says &quot;Wolfsburg&quot;. Below that it says
something about the internal movement. On the back, it has a VW logo,
with some vines and leaves? below it. This would be a very nice addition
to my &quot;VW shrine&quot;

TIA

Michael.
