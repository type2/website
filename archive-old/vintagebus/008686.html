&gt;Plus so far
&gt;we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.
This
&gt;would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis,
&gt;westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb

Did anyone stop to realize that all crows feet rim have a manufacturer stamp
of &quot;Lemmerz&quot; on them? (its small but visible on a nice clean rim) - never
seen Lemmerz on a non crows rim. Johann Lemmerz being the first man &quot;to
invent a removable multi-piece (welded)  rim, that attaches with 5 bolts -
in 1946.&quot;  He opened the factory in germany right after the war. &quot;Hayes -
Lemmerz&quot; is now the largest rim manufacturer in the world.
    The rumor I heard was that Lemmerz came to VW with the proposed idea of
a better stronger rim, that would flex less due to the crows foot pattern.
Lemmerz then changed to some kind of &quot;rivetless rivet method&quot; when making
his rims in 59, so maybe that didn't gel too well with VW. Do barndoor rims
have Lemmerz stamped on them?

I search thru the piles at every swap, and i find plenty of 58,59 NON crows
foot and occasionally a 57 NON crows foot. Lemmerz Seems to have stopped VW
production as of 60. (never seen one)
My 57 SC came OG with all 4 Lemmerz. 2 of them are damaged so my hunt still
continues for 2 more &quot;correct&quot; ones.
