Subject: Re: wiper arms

Thanks to several folks (E&amp;B, Bob Petzel) who wrote that the wiper arms should be in the 11-12&quot; range.  Mine are about 9&quot;, which explains a lot. :)

I'm gonna root through my parts stash this evening, but if anyone has a pair of correct-length wiper arms they're willing to part with, please let me 
know via p-mail.  I need the type with the pinch bolt at the base -- supposedly fits all buses up to 67.  I believe the p/n is 221 955 407A (latest 
version, apparently the only diff with the A suffix is that it was silver), though both busdepot and wolfsbergwest list it as 211, not 221.
