&gt;the liquid gasoline itself does expand/ contract significantly.

we need a petro engineer or physicist in on this one - does the 
GASOLINE expand, or does the increase in vapor pressure (basically, 
more gasoline turning into  vapor due to heat) FORCE the gas out of 
the filler neck etc. since liquids are incompressible, i'm willing to 
bet the increased vapor pressure PUSHING on the gasoline is the 
culprit.

&gt;Liquid water doesn't expand/ contract much at all between freezing and
&gt;boiling,

i'm coming over to your house to put about 20 glass bottles of soda 
in yer freezer!  :)
