Subject: Bus Interior Question

Howdy Bus folks,

I have an interior question on my '66 13 window Deluxe Bus.  How many
passenger assist grab handles were mounted inside the Bus and what was the
layout on the round coat hooks also(were they sometimes doubled up one under
the other)? I am aware of the one on the dash, it is intact and in place.
Also, there is one on the partition between the front seats and back seats,
that one is good too.  Seems my Bus has had a variety of these installed
over the years and I just wanted to get a good idea as to how many of these
I need to order continue the restoration project.

Thanks
Gary P Alexander
