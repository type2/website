Of interest to Brits mainly...
A friend of mine has run out of cash on a restoration. Looking at the pics, 
he's replaced almost the entire floor, Schofield panels all over, there 
must be a pound of Schofield stickers on the thing...  The floor itself 
isn't there yet, bitten off more than he could chew it seems. I expect 
he'll want to offload cheap. It's a '57 from Portugal, Safaris (condition 
unknown) It must owe him at least 1500 quid.
I can get his number if anyones interested.

Damon.
