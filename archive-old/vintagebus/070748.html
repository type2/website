Subject: RE: [VB] re:what the son said

Great idea, prevents a lot of double speak tactics also.

...

One suggestion to help prevent some of the problems happening...find one
person in the shop-and have them be the contact person. When you ask many
people the same question - confusion arises. Keep it simple, if you want
answers that matter-always ask to speak with the same person. I don't know
who is more competent-the father or his son, but just pick one. And stik
with them.
