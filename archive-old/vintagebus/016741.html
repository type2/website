Subject: Spare Tire and Cigarette Lighter
Date: Sat, 17 Jun 2000 22:27:26 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have two questions, the first is about a spare tire, I have Empi 5 spoke 
wheeels on now, but I lack a spare tire. Now I have 2 original rims (it is a 
'67 bus) should the tires that fit on te Empi's also work on the orginal 
rims?
My second question is about installing a cigarette lighter, I have heard it 
is relatively easy and was wondering if someone could give me some 
tips/instructions
Thanks
Ben
