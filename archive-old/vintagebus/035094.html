A short Oregon gas story. A few years ago, my wife and I drove our Porsche
944 to Portland for a car club event. Our first Oregon fill up was in Eugene.
A highly skilled local gas pumper started out okay, then it got away from
him. I guess the pressure of pumping high test fuel was too much. Probably
not a collage guy. He sprayed in the passenger window, in the sunroof, all
over both Recarro seats, and me in the passenger seat. I was loudly not
amused. After I blotted out the inside and washed the car myself (the
employees were instructed by the owner over the phone not to help) and aired
the car out overnight, we finely were able to drive it with the windows open.
I called the owner the next afternoon and was told that he reviewed the video
tape of the event and was also not amused. Chevron bought me new upholstery
on my entire interior, a sunroof seal, and rebuilt the seats. Cost um over
$1200.
