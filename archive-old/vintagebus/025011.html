&gt;Front or rear?&gt;&gt;

Thom,


left front and right rear, so I've been told.  I notice more noise as I
went
along, but I'm not that much of an expert on which wheels particularly.

 Eric and Barb

&lt;&lt;on top of that I've a leaking nose cone bushing which is a
 big jobber I know, but the same q&amp;a  goes for that as well...  &gt;&gt;
Unless it is a really super bad leak, it is not unusual for this area to
drip
some.  Especially if you over filled the tranny a little.

the tranny fluid was replaced as recently as october by a qualified
mechanic, also a friend.  so, I trust that he filled it well.  is this
as common as you say?
the other mechanic's words were, &quot;it's pouring.&quot;  now, I haven't noticed

any strong leaks besides the occasional oil in the rear.  what should I
do?
