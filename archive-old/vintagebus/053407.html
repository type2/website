&gt; Thanks to all who responded to my previous post about my generator light.
&gt; It was the regulator, which I replaced, and everything is fine.

Doug,

If you have time, and want a cheap adventure, dig under the sealant in the
center of the top cover of your old regulator to expose the screw that
holds the top on, and go in there and clean all the relay contacts, using
a points-file. If  they aren't damaged, and just dirty, then you may just
have a working spare, or if you are like me, you put it back into service
to see just how long it will last.
