I recently sold a bus to a fellow in CA and he had a company pick up my
bus in Wyoming and deliver to LA for about $700.  A few other buyers
tried to get quotes but they were twice the price and backed out of the
deal.

The company usually uses the big Semi trucks like the car dealers but in
my instance they used a flatbed that carried 3 vehicles.  Anyway the
actual company he dealt with was a local company that went through a
larger company www_dot_carmovers_dot_com

The sunroof which was pretty rotten was pretty much gone from the wind,
but I kind of expected that to happen, other than that it showed up in
good shape.
