Here's a research tool, mouse over the states to see the prices. Europe and Canada are there too.

I'll be at OCTO and the Classic. Instead of meeting listees at the brewpub across Katella, stop by my orangish-yellow DC at the post OCTO party (I forget where it is, the invite was sent to the list) and I'll give you a quality beer that, unlike John Howard's brand, cost more than gasoline. No, I don't know the octane, but it's lower than 90. 

Thom, you don't have to stop in podunk towns, but some of my best friends live in podunk towns. People from LA and San Francisco think of Sacramento as podunk. Hope to see you down south. I'm leaving early Friday for a family stop in Arvin near Bksfield.

Is it ironic that we're spending billions of dollars for high-tech missile defense and the best solution the administration has for the &quot;energy crisis&quot;  is to pump stuff out of holes in the ground and burn it?     -somebody from a podunk town
