Wayne, et al,

I spoke with the guys from Wolfgang at OCTO, and they
admitted that the boxes they had (rebuilt at $199)
were NOT built from new.  Wolfsburg West will have
NEW! parts (worm, sector, bushings and seals)
available shortly, so, I'm waiting for new parts,
rather than &quot;as tight as we can get them&quot;.

JP

I think it was BFY and a few other
&gt; places. I could not find a 
&gt; rebuilt anyway in Dallas (or at least the 6 places I
&gt; checked) so I gambled 
&gt; and bought a used one for $75.  It turned out great
&gt; but who knows about a 
&gt; year or two down the road.
&gt; good luck,
