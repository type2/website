&gt; Ron, if youre going to resell these holler and Ill wait for you.



As promised, I checked into the availability of these Stainless bus
mufflers, and here's what I found.

The one that VW Heritage in the UK sells is actually South African made, and
indeed has a stainless steel exterior body, although the internal cavity,
weld points, flanges, etc. are not stainless (as is the case with many
mufflers sold as &quot;stainless&quot;).  The feedback I've heard is that compared to
the stock German made Ernst system that I sell now, it is a lighter gauge of
steel and the fit is not quite as good.  Still, by virtue of the fact that
it's stainless, it is probably likely to outlast the Ernst despite those
limitations, and the fit is still better than most of the aftermarket and
South American mufflers out there.  Eventually it will probably rust out at
the flanges, welds, etc., but probably would take much longer than a
non-stainless muffler, which rusts everywhere.

The muffler is similar to but not identical to a stock muffler.  As opposed
to a US Spec bus muffler, which has a long connecting pipe between the
muffler and tailpipe, this one's tailpipe exits straight out from the
muffler.  This is more like the Euro spec OEM mufflers.  It has a single
tailpipe, not dual pea-shooters like a Bug.  The tailpipe they normally sell
with it is not stainless steel, not particularly heavy-duty, and also sticks
straight out.  This means that it will rust, and also would not fit a
Splitty because it would rub the apron.  However, I can have proper
Stainless tailpipes made, which would also angle downward like a correct Bus
tailpipe, so they'd look more &quot;stock&quot; and fit both a splitty and a '68-71
bus.  Cost would be about $129 including the stainless tailpipe (which
itself accounts for about $30 of that price).

There is another, better, but more expensive Stainless option as well.  This
is a European made muffler, with an integrated tailpipe.  Again similar but
not identical to the original.  Not an &quot;extractor&quot; looking setup like the
Empi's et. al., but more round-shaped than the stock muffler . This is a
very heavy-duty muffler, 100 percent stainless, even at the weldpoints, etc.
By all accounts I've heard,  this thing's &quot;bulletproof.&quot;   Also more
expensive - more like $249 complete.  If you're keeping your bus for a while
and don't relish exhaust work, this is the one.  (Incidentally, this is the
same company that would provide the aforementioned stainless tailpipe for
the cheaper muffler described above if we went that route.)

I can bring either or both into the U.S., and have them here in about 7-8
weeks.  This is in addition to the non-Stainless stock Ernst system that I
already sell for $95 with listmember discount.

I'd like a show of hands as to who's interested in one or the other.  I sure
don't want to bring in a ton of stainless mufflers - particularly the
high-end ones - unless I know you all want them.

PS  The above info relates to busses thru '71.  If you have a later bus or
Vanagon, I already stock stainless exhausts for most years; check the
website or email me.
