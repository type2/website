Hello all,

The following are my own personal observations and opinions about the
Kelley Park event.  You are obviously free to agree or disagree or
whatever...

As a Kelley Park attendee for the last eight or nine years now, I have seen
the event grow in size to maximum capacity and witnessed the problems that
Steve so thoroughly mentioned in his report on the new event guidelines. 
While I appreciate most styles, treatments and types of Volkswagens, as I'm
sure the GGVVWC staff and members do too, I have to agree with, and aplaud
the GGVVWC for making the difficult decision to firm up their event
policies and rules for the preservation of the event.  Kelley Park is a
&quot;Vintage oriented event&quot;, organized and hosted by the Golden Gate Chapter
of the &quot;Vintage Volkswagen Club of America&quot;, and I'm glad they are
re-focusing again on that emphasis.  If I was really into VW drag racing,
I'd attend the many events at race track facilities that are geared to that
faction of the hobby.  There are also many events that cater to the entire
spectrum of the VW hobby, and their events, facilities, activities and car
class award structure reflect that diversity.  And then there is a time for
Vintage VW's, and there are relatively few VW events that focus intensely
on only Vintage VW's.  The Kelley Park event was originally, and is trying
again to be that kind of specialized event.  

Yes, in making these changes the GGVVWC can't avoid ruffling a few feathers
out there.  Yes, they risk losing a few attendees as they focus on their
Clubs' original mandate.  But in the long run, they will be rewarded as the
event becomes even better know for it's re-found focus.  Face it, it is
their Club, their event, they take the risks and shoulder the
responsibility.  For some time now they have not been happy with some of
the inconsiderate things they've seen happen during the event, they are
tired of paying for the irresponsibility of the few, and the organizers
felt they had to change some guidelines to reclaim the event.  So it's
their right to organize and run the event as they see fit.  If you happen
to be one of the few folks that can't or don't want to adapt to the new
event guidelines, you have the choice of voting with your feet and
attending other events that cater to your style.  

I believe that given time and steady but fair administration of the event,
Vintage VW enthusiasts will flock to Kelley Park for one of the few annual
USA events that will reward them with just what they want to see...stock,
original Volkswagens and an awesome Vintage oriented swap meet like no
other.  Who knows, eventually the GGVVWC Kelley Park Meet might even be
talked about with the kind of respect and awe that we associate with the
Bad Camberg event.  I for one can't wait until April!  Give it a chance to
succeed.

Well...there's my opinion,

Bill Bowman
NEATO, VVWCA, LiMBO, VWCA, DKF, etc, etc.
