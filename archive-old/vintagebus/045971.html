&lt;&lt; hello 
 can anyone tell me if there would be a problem using
 brake drums from a 1966 front end on a 1967 front end.
 the drums look practically identical, but that doesn't
 mean much, i know.
 thanks, 
 e.s.
==================
yes, that fine, they used the same drum 64-67.   There are some cosmetic 
differences, but that may be a manufacturer, not a year thing.  As long at 
the circle where the brake shoe goes is the same diameter and width, and the 
place the wheel bearing goes is the same.  Do keep the race together with the 
bearing when swapping drums, they are made matched.
