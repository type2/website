I was trying to see just how &quot;locked up&quot; I could get my '62.

OK, the cargo doors lock, the rear hatch locks, I finally figured
out that the passenger door locks, the vent wings latch, driver
door locks with a key.  Okay, should deter the casual &quot;just try
the door&quot; type thief.  I can get in the driver side sliding window,
just by lifting slightly and pushing.  Then pull the handle and 
I'm in!!!  (To me, this kinda sucks).   I'm hoping it was designed
a little better than that, and I'm missing something.  Not expecting
anything like high security, just don't enjoy making it as easy
as possible to get in my van.

I came out of a show the other day, there was a hippy couple making
out in my van!  Sitting on the cargo floor, making out!  Now, I admit,
I did leave the cargo doors unlocked, and my bus looks pretty damned
hippy friendly, but c'mon.  I was kinda freaked, scared, mad, and 
just the tiniest bit flattered at the same time.  I didn't quite have
the nerve to say something like &quot;hey, if you're gonna use my van to
make out, you have to share your girl with ME&quot; or any other Alpha
way of dealing with the situation.  

They were pretty wasted, and they thought it was somebody else's 
bus, and I knew the guy whose bus they thought it was, so I guess
there was a bit of deniable plausibility, but not much... 

Needless to say, I always lock my doors now.  Karma is not the best
security system, apparently.  People are not always deterred by 
&quot;the vibe.&quot;


I sure miss my dog.  She would have licked the interlopers to death...
