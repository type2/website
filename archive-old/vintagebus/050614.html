Subject: Re: [VB] 62' bus question

I second that.  When I got my doublecab I drove it on short trips for
about 350 miles.  Finally checked the gear oil before a long trip and
found that the tranny was about 1.25 quarts low.  (RGBs were full,
though.)

&gt; When you get it do the delayed maintenance thing, including changing engine
&gt; oil, tranny oil, make sure it has good tranny boots, inspect brakes/ replace
&gt; hoses and whatever else is needed.  I know a couple people who killed trannys
&gt; by driving them dry- they had never checked the tranny oil since buying the
&gt; bus, and there wasn't any.
