Mike wrote:  What is this pump called anyway?

Hi Mike either it is a 40HP fuel pump with circular bolted on top plate, or 
the 1300 and later fuel pupm with the pentagon shaped bolted on top.  Check 
Wolfsburg West for the quality rebuild kits.
Though your fuel in the engine case can also be caused by:
1. Too high of fuel pump rod causing too high of fuel pressure.
2.  Bad, stuck or no seal on the shut off valve in the carburetor.
3.  Too heavy or cracked shut off float in the carburetor.
4.  Too rich of jetting in the carburetor.
