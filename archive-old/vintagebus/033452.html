Hey all,

Just got in from the first annual Bring Your Own Bus (aka: the Red Barn 
Show) and wow, it was great!  I really didn't know what to expect given the 
weather, the response off the net, and so forth.  We basically packed the 
whole place!  Nature shined on us...once the cold, damp morning 
passed...and I have the burn to prove it.  Speaking of burns, John Howard 
definitely has a story to tell everyone on the list.  I'll let him tell it 
but there will be pictures up at both VW Planet and Vintagebus_dot_com in just 
a minute!

I've been home all of a half hour and really can't find the words to 
describe how jazzed I am to have seen this whole show come together.  I 
think the show saw about 30 to 35 buses and the swap area was easily double 
that!  So I will estimate the whole Bus turnout was around 100, but I don't 
think we ever got an accurate count.  All I heard all day were positive 
responses from everyone!  The people who run the Red Barn were so impressed 
that they want to see us rent the *entire* place next year!  Yeah, loads 
more room...so Bring Your Own Bus 2002 will have lots of room to expand.

I will have show pictures and results up at http://www.sv2s_dot_com/svt early 
next week and maybe, just maybe you will all see an article in VW Trends 
when they cover the Kelley Park Weekend.

Big big big freakin thanks to everyone who donated items, everyone at SV2s 
who either donated their time or just came up for the event, Richard 
Stewart for being open to this idea in the first place, and even though 
they're not on the list, the people at the Red Barn for being so accomodating!

More later,
-Taylor
