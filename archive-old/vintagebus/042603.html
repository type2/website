hi clara,

Since i am using a type3 case, the oil senser boss in the normal location
is not drilled and tapped. Its just blank, no hole at all, though the boss
is there.

I have been considering drilling and tapping it by using lots of grease to
catch the shavings i just have nightmares of one big magnesium chip going
in my oil passage and plugging up a oil passage and SCREECH!

Whenever i tear the engine down and rebuild it i will drill and tap, im
just scared to do it on an assembled engien, though i may chance it...

take care,

Steve
