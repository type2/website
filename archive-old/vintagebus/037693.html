Hi Charles,
If so then you might have a 1200 or 1300cc engine or even a 1500.  
The 40HP 1200 and earlier intake manifolds from the rear view perspective 
bend in a nice 90 degree angle.  The later 1300 thru 1600 (This can also be a 
1200 and even in dual port in non N. American locations!) it looks like the 
manifold went a little too far outward and angles back inward to hook up to 
the heads.
