Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Puzzler - Need Help

Attach a wire to the the push on terminal of your starter and run it into the 
engine compartment and touch it to the hot terminal orf the battery to start 
the bus  Next time the starter wont turn with the key, try using the wire.  
this bypasses the wiring up front and back. 

 It it doesn;t work with the wire (or crawling under and crossing the 
terminals with a screwdriver with a screwdriver) then your starter is at 
fault.  either take it apart  and fix it or replace it.  I like th $45 
schmucks/kragen forever warranty starter

If it does work with the wire, then your wirng is at fault.  clean all the 
connections- starter, battery, ground fuse box, light switch etc.   If that 
doesn't work get a relay.

I finally got one for my 65, which had been developing starting issues, the 
fault of the wiring, and no cleaning comletely fixed it.    from wolfgang in 
redding, it was Bosch and plugged in, no wire cutting needed.  Did the trick.

 This hard-starting relay kit is available at RMMW and is probably in
 some of the other better known VW parts catalogs as well.  I used it on
 one of my ACVWs with the same symptoms a couple years ago, fixed it
 right up.  Two years later the starter motor (original item) finally
 gave out anyway.

 &gt; &gt; Here's a puzzler that I'm living with right now:
 &gt; &gt; '67 deluxe. runs great. starts up just perfectly when cold.
 &gt; &gt; ride around for 15-30 minutes, and when I shut the ignition off, it
 &gt; &gt; will not restart. no noise, no starter, nothing.
 &gt; &gt; battery is fine. lights work.
 &gt; &gt; I let the bus sit for 30-45min., try it again, and it starts right up!
