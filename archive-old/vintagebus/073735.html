&gt; Hump in the middle? This is a bench seat right?? No natural hump that I am

&gt; padding/worn padding??

Yes, there is a definite &quot;hump&quot; in the '61/'62 bus front bench seats. 
Only the back rest has the hump...not the bottom.  Two year only thing. 
The hump &quot;separates&quot; the driving position from the passenger spot. 
These two models also have the 3 position back/bottom seat brackets.  I
call them the &quot;Billy Bardy&quot; brackets, cuz only he was short enough to
need anything closer than the farthest back position. 

Lots of other 61/62 things I'm sure.  Odd.
