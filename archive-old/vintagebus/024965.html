Guys,

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I think you need to try to
find a way to accept your Bus for who he/she/it is and enjoy these
little inconveniences, or buy a newer Bus.

The rear hatch of my '65, while easier to open and load (springs and
wider hatch), is somehow not as COOL as the '63. Propping up the hatch
while holding a large bundle is an art form that will amaze your friends
and neighbors.

As for the sliding windows, well, you just don't see cars built these
days with these kind of innovative features. Sure, S#b_at_ru tried to
emulate that wondrous design with their S^X, but they put 'em in
sideways!

With each passing year, our splitties' funk factor grows. Every new car
with power windows, rectangular headlights, keyless entry,automatic
doors, and three-foot-long tail lights makes the simplistic beauty of
our busses more distinguished.

Should you improve your bus? YES! Better brakes,bigger engine,seatbelts,
Great.Make it safer and more fun to drive,but try to keep as many of the
wierd original features as you can. Or buy a newer Bus.

No offense, just my opinion.
Dave
