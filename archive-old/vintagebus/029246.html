&gt;  Anyway it takes a long time for the bus to
&gt; return to idle after it has been reved to a higher rpm.

Most (if not all) 34PICT-3 carbs came with little doodads to control the speed
of returning to idle.  One of them would sit right in front of the carb...a
little circle with vacuum lines coming off of it mounted in a bracket (i forget
the name of it)... another I've seen mounts to the top of the carb body with 2
screws on the side of the bowl.  Its a little round disc with a rod coming out
of it that rests on the throttle arm.  This is so that if you let off the gas
really quick... it won't slam right down to idle.... just smooths things out.
Do you have either of these on the carb??
