&gt;:  &gt;carb recently rebuilt
&gt;
&gt;This sounds suspicious.  I'd bet the problem's in here.  Either in the
&gt;form of a bit of something partially blocking a port, the choke not
&gt;being adjusted correctly (or engaged at all), the mixture screw being
&gt;out to lunch, etc, etc.  I've caused myself more problems by &quot;fixing&quot;
&gt;carbs than everything else I've done put together....

I second this, re-builds are ok 'sometimes', but I have decided to replace
with new carbs instead and save myself the headaches. Look for a 30-31PICT
brand new for sale on ebay or at a show for $65 or under and relieve some
stress my friend.
