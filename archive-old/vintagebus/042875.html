I would have to say that this bus is a scam (no offense).  It's pretty
thrashed, and it's missing a lot of parts.  In the description it even
says that the owner would sell most of the parts that it needs separately
(what a coincidence, huh?).  In the pictures it doesn't even look like it
has an engine.  Sorry if this turned into a rant.  In other words, no I
don't think that would be worth 1750.  But what do I know, I'm just a kid.
