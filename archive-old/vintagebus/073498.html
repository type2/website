Subject: Re: [VB] Oil opinions

Greeting Bus Brothers,

I like to use hemp oil with a little bit of patchouli oil thrown in for good measure.  I think the oil karma keeps my temps down, and I have never had a problem while following the Phish tours.

I take off alot of tin to let more air in, along with my custom scoops.

Oh man...it's 4:20 I gots ta go.

Peas out,

Beto

&gt; My 1600 sp has never overheated and I drive the heck out of it. 20/50 Kendal, Doghouse set-up, Full flowed (no extra cooler) and a 1 1.5 quart sump. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have always run that oil and never had a problem.
