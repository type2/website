Subject: RE: [VB] iT'S FRIDAY

yea.... you can hop in it, slam the heck outa the door
to get it to shut, put whats left of the key in and
fire it up... spare was put on night of the
accident... as for the brakes.... they still work...
just a shutter in the truck when applyed... it still
tracks straight. Did a quick front end check when I
got home... alignment still good... bent draglink
mabey? Havent looked into it that close yet...

&gt; I thought you said turn key. To me that means get in

&gt; with the key broke off, damaged brakes, bent rim,
&gt; and who know what
&gt; else, it's not quite turn key. IMHO
