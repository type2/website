Subject: Yet another tranny question!

i bought a  tranny that was leaking from the side covers so i took it apart 
to replace the gaskets. Since I had to shell out almost $30 for an entire 
gasket set to get the O rings that I needed I figured I'd reseal everthing 
while I was there. Well after taking the nosecone off I was confronted by 2 
HUGE bolts, not sure what size, somewhere above 30mm. I took out the 
retaining bolt for the bearing but the case still wont open. Do these nuts 
have to come off? If so I would I be better off to just take it to my local 
VW shop wouldnt I?
Thanks everyone,
Kelly
