Subject: brake upgrade idea

yesterday when I was in the parts store looking to pick up a new master
cylinder, I got an idea. My brakes had been working fine and had plenty
of fluid when one day the master went out and they just went to the
floor. This got me thinking about changing over to a dual circuit
master, but I didn't want to relocate the reservoir. The original Idea
was to use a rabit reservoir in a bug dual master with the 67 rubber
grommets. While looking around for the rubber grommets we found an old
volvo reservoir. It fits perfectly into the stock rubber grommets. Not
only are the nipples that go into the grommets shapped exactly like the
ones that are on the plastic fittings that the hoses attach to, but they
are spaced exactly the right distance appart and it looks like the lid
will be directly under the existing hole in the floor. If all of this
works out I will just need to drill out the threads in the base of the
bug master,  bend over the one rear brake line to its new location on
the master, use a pipe plug to plug the second sender location on the
later master, reassemble it, and bleed the brakes. It seems pretty
strait forward. The late bug master should displace the same volume of
brake fluid and was the same price as my 65 master would have been, and
he gave me the used volvo reservoir for 5 bucks. If this works, It will
be much safer with just a $5 upgrade.
