Subject: full length german rack for sale OREGON

I bought a fixer full length rack at the woodburn show and on the way out I
spotted a bus for sale with the same rack that had already been blasted and
coated. I managed to buy that one so need to sell the fixer and get my money
back from it. No clamps. The worst of it is someone cut about a 1 ft section
out of two of the bars to clear something coming out of the roof of their
bus. It's only the straight part of the bars, the smaller curved bars at the
side are still intact. I'd like to get three hundred for it. Pictures will
be available thursday. I'm right off I-5 if some one want's to pick it up or
have it picked up.
It's this style http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+41901.jpg
just longer.
