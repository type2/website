Hello all,

I was wondering how many of you out there drive with your safari's open and 
have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the SoCal area and I asked a 
CHP officer the other day about it and he said that it was illegal to drive 
with them open and that if they saw me doing it, they'd ticket me.  So I was 
curious if anyone has ever recieved a ticket for an open safari.

Thanks,

Alex
