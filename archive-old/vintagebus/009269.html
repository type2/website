Hi all
I am finalizing our plans to Travel from Southern Ontario to Nova Scotia, in
time to see the Tall ships in the Harbour!  Because of this goal, the trip
east will be as fast as we can,,
We will be taking the Watermelon on it's second East  Coast Tour.
Along the road we will be joined by other Buser's tooo!

Then we will be travelling in a relaxed mode around the Maritimes Provinces

We plan to leave July 20 and get a few hrs east before night fall

Are there any listees that have a nice camping spot,, say, around the Oshawa
to Belleville area? or perferably somewhere like Brighton area. Can you send
me the name and location so I can book something..

We are hoping to hit Cornwall area about Lunch time Friday,, and maybe hook
up with some listee's in that area for chatter over lunch,

We will enter USA and head for Burlington Vt then the infamous Airport Rd #2
to Bangor.

We might take the ferry to Nova Scotia from St John New Brunswick , But the
one from Bar Harbor is alot of money!

If we don't catch the ferry saturday, we will drive along the shores of the
bay of fundy, and into Nova Scotia, to Halifax on sunday i guess.

I was wondering if you've travelled portions of this route, or live along
it,, could you mail me off list with suggestions, comments.. places that we
shouldn't miss etc.
