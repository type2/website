US government employee (me) will be leaving Europe (Germany) shortly, and I 
would like to take back to the states with me (shipping is free... one 
vehicle only) a 195? - 196? split screen CREWCAB.

Have cash and trades to aquire the vehicle, and SHOULD be running 
condition.... at least enough to get it on and off the boat.

ANY leads or connections would be GREATLY appreciated.
