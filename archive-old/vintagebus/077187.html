&gt; We did have a recent thread about working under a Bus with such a drop
&gt; light.  However, I would respectfully submit that if your Bus regularly
&gt; drips gas while parked, you have a bigger problem on your hands than how
&gt; to keep the sump warm.  I haven't seen too many parking lots with &quot;no
&gt; smoking&quot; sections...

I agree.  For quite some time on non-VW cars we had a reflector heat lamp
(like is used in bathroom ceilings) mounted on a ceramic swivel base for
the express purpose of warming the sump.  It would work even better on a
VW sump, but I've never needed to keep a VW warm to start it in my mild
climate.

If your vehicle is dripping gas, cold starting is the least of your
worries!
