&lt;&lt; What does the preheat tube connect to?  Is it a &quot;J&quot; shaped thing right 
under
 the tin?  If so, how does it bolt onto the car? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Depends!  The 40 HP version is short, straight and attaches to the rear left 
head exhaust stud and thru the small lower tin to the rear of the #4 
cylinder.  1300 - 1500 tube is longer and shaped like a J, which is attached 
to one of the rear right head exhaust studs and thru the small lower tin 
piece to the rear of #2 cylinder.
