Subject: A Great Sin

Last night my son's panel was broken into and all of his tools, specialized 
and otherwise were stolen.  Insurance will replace the tools but the wing 
window is another thing since he operates on a shoestring and could not 
afford that level of car insurance. My homeowners is picking up the tool 
replacement since he is hitching on my insurance thank goodness.  Anyway... 
does anyone have wing window glass for the passenger side of a 63 panel??

As for the evil doer... well, we will simply have to conjure the dark gods 
to tear his soul from his body... simple, clean, no problem.
