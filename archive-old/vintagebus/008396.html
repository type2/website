Subject: clutch pedal assem.

Last Sunday I was doing some routine maintanance to my 64,
and while I was adjusting the clutch I noticed
the pedal wasn't coming all the way back up.I know the return spring was
reasonably new ( I replaced it last year)
On further examination I noticed the pedal pivot point( where the pedal
pivots on the frame)
was hanging up.I removed pedal assem. greased the pin and bushings and
reassem..
Now the pedal returns all the back to the &quot;up&quot; position and all is well.
I also installed all new locks on all handles and ign. to fit one key,
adjusted the brakes and adj. valves.
It's amazing how much one gets done when the Bears aren't worth watching.
