Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

I play it safe, and leave a bouncy 1/2 inch of loose play at the pedal -
no more broken cables, they fall apart from age now. My last one went 12
years. The 1/2 inch that I leave seems to be just the taking up of cable
slack, then the rear spring really kicks in another inch down, then the
TO/clutch kicks in a short distance further. Leaves me tons of pedal room
for the clutch.

The first half-inch is spring-driven though, so it isn't loose-loose. It's
just light and easily finger-pushable.

&gt; the tranny, which is what I thought you were saying.  The deal is actually,
&gt; the play before the arm moves, or the play before the clutch moves?   it
&gt; should be before the clutch moves, and the arm should move right away.
