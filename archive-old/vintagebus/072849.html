Hi to all ours friends and family,
Now to bring the story up to date-- We are currently in Pine River, MN for the fourth night with a very nice family who have been sharing parts of their world and family. Now to back up a few days--
   	After the time in Eau Claire, Wisconsin with Mary, Danielle, and Emily, we enjoyed the hospitality of the CVVC car club and the CVVC 5th Annual Show and Swap at the County Fairgrounds on June 20-22, 2003.  We did get long distance award that included matching event T shirts ( perfect )   :) .  We stopped back to see Ron on the way out of Eau Claire but we miss him :(  .
   	Traveling on we headed to Superior WI, to see Ron and Sally Philip's son-in-laws parents.  Sally was away in Alaska :( but Ron showed us the local sights, many deer grazing in town at dusk, some of his local (very local) hunting grounds, and sharing there very interesting and splendid home of a 1917 converted library with their splendid antiques and treasures (also some lake trout and venison BBQ meals). We left Superior WI after a cool trip to the close out sale of Menards (a big change home improvement store).
   	Now down the back roads to the Scamp trailer factory in Backus, MN which was VERY poor based on one of the rudest salesman we have every met. He would not give us a brochure or allow us to see his display models .. very rude!!!! 
   	Philip started driving as we left Scamp factory :(  and a noise and vibration had developed with the clutch and was increasing.  Cautiously proceeding down the road we found the little town of Pine River, MN.  We stopped at the barbershop to get directions to the library to gain internet access and that starts our adventures in Pine River, MN.
   	Cora, the very helpful librarian, help us with the internet and we started putting out the word on the Double cabs need of help via AIRS and helpful contacts on the many VW list we are members.  Then awaiting responses, Cora invited us to their home ( a very friendly home on 40 acres with a nice barn which we are in and typing this now. ) We order a floor jack, removed the motor to find the snap ring that retains the clutch arm shaft had sprung to allow the shaft and throw out bearing to slip to one side against the transmission input shaft. So new spring clips and we put it all back together but the damage to the clutch pressure had been done and some of the same conditions still existed so then worked on ordering a new clutch, disc, pressure plate and another throw out bearing and now we wait on UPS.... BUT
   	There is more...
   	We were about to pull the engine Sunday morning so that everything would be ready when the parts arrived.  That also left us time to help John &amp; Cora with some projects around the farm.  They got a call that there was a fly-in at the local airport so John &amp; Cora grabbed their motorcycles, stopped and picked up the neighbors, Mike &amp; Sue, on their motorcycle and we got John &amp; Cora's truck and drove to the airport.  There were several planes there, new and old, including a 1946 funk.  The pilot told us about another show in Aitken including cars and tractors.  About 30 miles away - so off we go with 3 bikes and the truck following.  It was actual a rather large car show, about 100 cars including a 73 VW bus painted like the Scooby Doo mystery machine.  
   	We had a good time there and headed back.  In Pine River we stopped for food and fuel, and Mike overheard someone asking about the local librarian.   He listened in then tried to help only to find out that the two guys were looking for some folks that broke down in their VW and were staying with the librarian.  Mike figured this out quick and soon John &amp; Todd were headed on their Harleys to John &amp; Cora's with all of us.  We had been emailing John about our break down.  He was on the AIRS list and had offered help.  We had told him the town and the librarian and he needed a break from painting his mural ( a small 8' x 40' ) so he and Todd took off on a ride to check it out.   So motorcycle folks got to talk and show off toys and the VW folks got to talk and show off toys.  All in all a good day.
   	Well, today has been a work day with John &amp; Philip hauling home boards to fix the deck at the house, and Cora jumped in, hammer in hand.  Catherine fixed breakfast ????????? Philip's favorite biscuits &amp; gravy, then caught up on pictures, email, travel log, and other chores. Philip has found a new favorite cologne here in Minnesota ????????? deet ????????? the stuff they put in mosquito repellant.  A definite necessity at certain times of the day.
   	Parts are expected in by Wednesday.  They should be easy to install then we will be on the road again.  Next stop will be to visit a few folks that offered to help us out along the way then a stop at the Mall of America, in  'The Cities', then south into Iowa for some genealogy work, then on toward Texas for the next family reunion.  We will keep you posted on our further adventures.
