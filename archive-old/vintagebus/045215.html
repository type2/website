Going to a neighbourhood garage sale yesterday I found someone who had a
cherry 67 caper in the garage. I bought a working 6V blaupunkt radio for very
little $$$, (going to Clara for her 6V 59 singlecab).  he also had a lot of
really nice hubcabs for $1.00 each. They were of the post 67 knd with a small
raised VW chromed in the middle, and two painted VW emblem hubcaps for about
1970. Anyone want them I will get them. He also had a Bug NOS bumper.
