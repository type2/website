It must be a _huge_ cat!  Most of those images are about 1m
resolution,
which means that you can identify a rectangular blob on the image as your
bus only because you know that a bus should be parked at that location
Trying to ID buses from those images would be rather difficult.

OTOH, if you worked for the NSA, you might be able to get at imagery and
computer power to make the ID rather easy...

&quot;Computer, please search the US for all 23 window VW buses not parked on
streets which have not moved for the past 5 years.&quot;

&gt;  A couple of years ago I went to Terraserver_dot_com and located satellite and
&gt;  aerial photos of our neighborhood.  This site/service has images from US
&gt;  sources and from Soviet satellite imagery.
&gt;  
&gt;  As it happened, a Soviet image was the clearest, and I was able to identify
&gt;  our old '68 Westy and our H*nda parked at the curb in front of our house.
&gt;  It was quite a surprise to see how detailed the image really was, and also
&gt;  how many times we'd been overflown!
