Subject: re:Cabinet Templates

I made cabinets for my ez-camper, based on the original design. Re-using the
original metal edging on the doors. I tried to make drawings of every
cabinet, as I made them, I believe someone on the list agreed to post them
on their website, but I've forgotten who.

 

If anyone wants them p-mail me, and I can send them to you. Or if someone
else wants to post them on their website, let me know. I can not guarantee
the accuracy of my drawings, but they should be pretty damn close.
