Robert,

You really got me going on this one.  I just went out and looked at my '59 
Westy (original everything) and it looks like the lower color was painted 
over the upper, unlike my later busses, but I'll have to look in the daylight 
(and maybe pull the door panels).  Damn, this is the kind of thing that 
really keeps me on the list and in the dark!
