Subject: How good can the steering get?

I have replaced everything under the '63 bus but the steering box, and I =
have adjusted that. I still have some wandering and when I hit those =
little bumps on the traffic lines it will lurch to the left or right. I =
have low profile tires which may add to the problem, but it shouldn't be =
this bad.

My question is; how good can the steering get on an old bus, and If I =
replace the steering box will I see a great improvement?
