Subject: Too rusty?? 65 deluxe
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

How does one determine if a bus is unsavable? Saw a 65 deluxe today, but baby
is she rough. I know replacements are available for the lower parts, but the
roof from rain gutters up about 5 inches is crusty rusty. What is the rule of
thumb, if there is one? Of course, non running 1600 DP out of a bug in place.
Last driven many moons ago - looks like several years. 

The engine has had a life of it's own. Owner said out of a bug that he put in,
but has the rear plate to fit a later model bus mount. SO .....was born in a
bug, fitted for a bay bus, put back in a bug, and now in a splitty. :-)

If too trashed to save, will have COMPLETE deluxe trim, jail bars, some pop
outs, clock, Stewart 6V heater, front doors, tranny, salvageable front bumper
with trim.... for sale.

Let me know what you need. I posted about a rougher find (that I did not buy)
several months ago, and saved those requests, and those listees will have the
first shot, if an organ donor.

BTW, do not bring up my 71. It was probably too rusty to mess with, but
foolishness, fond memories, and mid-life crisis (my wife says &quot;cheaper than a
girlfriend&quot;) won out and the metal work is almost done, many thanks to Kelly
(aka Metwiz2_at_aol_dot_com).
