&gt; &lt;&lt; what year did single cabs start the duel doors to the under cargo area?
&gt; and was it an option or did they all get them? &gt;&gt;
and Eric&amp;Barb replied:
&gt; Somewhere about 1961 the formerly optional second tool bay door became a
&gt; standard item.

As noted in a previous post, M-Code 071 is for the second door.
The NEATO Old Bus Registry has 38 Single Cabs (type 261), back to
November 1958.  28 of them have M-Code 071 (from February 1960 to
the end of the Split run).  Of the 10 without 071, 8 of them are
before February 1960 and 2 are after that.  Maybe they just
became a &quot;standard option&quot; in 1960.
