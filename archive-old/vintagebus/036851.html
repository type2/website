if you want to run  a 6V radio with a 12V system you need  a voltage 
inverter.   Or if you want a 12V stereo with a 6V system you need  a voltage 
inverter.  this does some tricky inexplicable thing to the electricity that 
makes it work.    I have been there, done that.  no problem.     A w iper 
motor is simpler than a radio, so you can use a simple voltage drop on it if 
you convert to 12V.

It's no big deal.    take a few deep breaths.
