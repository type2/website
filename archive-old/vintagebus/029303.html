Get really good at jobs related to the Internet ie... Programming, Graphic
Design, or technical support. There are boundless jobs that pay really well
and it doesn't seem like it's going to slack off for a long time. Just a
suggestion.

&gt; Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
&gt; spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
&gt; would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
&gt; Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
&gt; that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn
