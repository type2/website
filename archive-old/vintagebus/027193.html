Wow!  That's a huge generalization.  I'm not Iranian, but if I were I'd be a bit
miffed.  To extrapolate that the lifters were not drilled because there were a
majority of Iranian workers at the plant is to say the least &quot;fuzzy&quot; logic.
What about the disgruntled German worker upset he wasn't getting his full
pension because VW was cutting back? Or the son of a British pub owner who was
killed in the blitz extracting a bit of revenge on the company founded by the
Nazis.  Absurd no?  This myth that only Germans could produce quality stuff is a
bit silly.
