Subject: Re: [VB] 6V-110VAC inverters

careful on these:

&gt;4. Stop for lunch, sit near an outlet, and your phone can usually
&gt;charge up pretty well, but you can't just &quot;squat-and-gobble&quot; at a fast
&gt;food place for this to work.
&gt;
&gt;5. Stop at a library to check your email (and VB list) and either plug
&gt;your charger into the wall or look for an open USB port...

in germany and japan, at least, people have been arrested for public 
wall-warting. the guy in germany was charged with theft of something 
like 4/100s of a euro's worth of electricity. hadn't heard of any 
stories from the US, but since you can be tasered in the DC subway 
for eating a candy bar, it might be best to ask for permission first!
