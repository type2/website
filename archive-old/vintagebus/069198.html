Subject: re: International shipping

Just make sure it is not a fake or stolen.  Once it clears its a moot
point though.  I had a friend accept a 3K real Bank of America cashiers
check given to him for a computer once.  He gave the merchandise to the
buyer (in person transaction) because the checked looked (and was
legit).  Only problem was that it was stolen!  When he went to B of A
they told him it was no good.  He was hosed big time!

Just make sure the money is in your account.
