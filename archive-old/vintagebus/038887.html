Subject: was work on my 61...now measuring tools

&gt; Anyone have any suggestions as to where I can get some decent measuring
&gt; tools without breaking the bank?


I have a brand new set of Mahr 6&quot; digital calipers and a 0-1&quot; digital micrometer
never used still in there boxes with all documentation $175 first come first
serve. These will display and measure in metric as well as in inches. A good
price if you know what these things cost new. I won the set last year at the
Chicago Quality Expo raffle, Benefit of missing your flight and being the only
one left at the show at raffle time. Anyway I already have plenty of measuring
tools. If I don't hear from anyone by Monday I'll put them on Ebay at no
reserve...How's that for a threat.

If I remember the numbers 16ES on the calipers and I can't remember the one on
the micrometers. But they are nice and Mahr is German and the Gauges that are
pictured in the Bentley are mostly Mahr, not digital of course.
