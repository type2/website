&gt;What is a WOT and where do I get some?

Many unenlightened people believe that the pedal that your right foot goes
on is a gas pedal.  But I know the truth!  It is actually an on-off switch.
Up is &quot;off&quot;, Down is &quot;on&quot; and anything in-between is boring.  When switched
on, you have achieved WOT (a.k.a. wide open throttle) and are ready to
venture forth into the world, Grasshopper.  (Any who don't believe me
haven't ridden with me!!!)
