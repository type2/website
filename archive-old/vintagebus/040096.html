Hey All,

I'm gonna have to replace the non adjustable tierod on my bus soon and 
noticed that you can get an adjustable tire rod for the passenger side as 
well.  This would seem advantagous, I think the adjustable one is even 
cheaper via busboys.  Any reason why I should not go adjustable on both 
sides?

Thanks,

Eric

&gt;it seemed - new tie rods &amp; drag link &gt;
