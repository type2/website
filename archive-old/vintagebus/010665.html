rear for my bus. The Bentley manual states about supporting main driveshaft 
while unit is on groud. I am confused at this point, if the reference is to 
axle tubes and redux boxes?&gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
Hmmm, we not sure what they are reffering to there.  Could you supply a 
section and page number for the info in question?

&gt;&gt;Will it be ok to have the trans attached to axles and tubes/reduxes, while 
laying in my S10's bed, and then disassembled in there _at_ home.&lt;&lt;

Yes, definitely!

&gt;&gt; I do not intend on using the trans, rebuilt unit instead, just dont want 
to waste the axles. Is there something I should ahve ready when I pick this 
thing up?&lt;&lt;

Tools and at least one helper to help you lift it into the truck.

&gt;&gt;As far as rebuilds go, does anyone know if Rancho or other ships the entire 
unit rebuilt assembled ahead of time? I am considering this avenue, if 
possible.&gt;&gt;

As far as we have heard Rancho is the best, but only ship center sections!  
Really best if you install the axles and this way you will have the knowledge 
of how to repair the RGBs and upper axles in a pinch!  We highly suggest 
getting the 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier.    Eric&amp;Barb
