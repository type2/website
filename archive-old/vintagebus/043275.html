Subject: Everybus in VW Trends


Howdy. I just wanted to let everyone know that in the November VW Trends
there is a write-up of this year's Everybus camp out. There are several
pictures of the various busses attending, including a lovely shot of my
camper. That's twice I've made it into VWT!
DocRic's pop-top is there also- not sure if any of the others are listee
busses.
Anyway, always nice to see NC events making it to the big time. Maybe
they'll cover Oktoberbus this year.
:)
