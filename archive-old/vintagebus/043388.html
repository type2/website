Hey all!

The Volkswagen Club of Tulsa is having their annual show
TODAY, Saturday, September 23, 2000.  Gates open at 7 am,
at-show registration closes at 10 am.  Judging is from 10 am
to 1 pm with awards at 3 pm.  As of Friday night we had
60 cars pre-registered, with many more expected tomorrow.
There will be a swap meet at the show on Saturday as well.

The show will be held in the parking lot of the Tulsa
Scottish Rite, 6355 East Skelly Drive.  This is on the
north side of I-44, at I-44 and Sheridan.  (You can see
the site from the Interstate).

The civic causes we're helping include the Tulsa Scottish
Rite Reading Disability Clinic, Meals on Wheels, and M.A.D.D.
Canned goods donations will be accepted for Meals on Wheels.

If you're in or around Tulsa today, stop on by!

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
