Subject: [VB] Front Axle Beam Swap
Message-ID: &lt;0.7705ecef.258d6a54_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I am a new &quot;List&quot; member and am the secret owner of a '67 Westy. 
I say secret because I and a few club members helped me find storage for the 
new project prior to my wife killing me before I unloaded a '72 Westy. Now 
that I have sold the 72 I plan to get the 67 project underway shortly after 
the holidays. My question to you is I will be swapping out the front end of 
the 67 due to a rusted axle beam. The upper drivers side shock support has 
rusted out and looking at the front end that I plan to use has some serial 
numbers stamped on it. Are these numbers just vin. numbers or something else 
? The front end is the King Link type and has the numbers 768528. Also any 
recommendations to sandblasting the front end clean and repainting it while 
she is out prior to the swap.

Thank you and Happy Holidays.

P.S. I was given a free Vintage VW Calender from my local Dealership. He told 
me that there are 4 styles to choose from 2 new and 2 vintage - Go get em !
