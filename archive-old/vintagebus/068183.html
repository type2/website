Subject: Re: [VB] How much pressure to grease king pin zerks?

Hm, if a good hard squeeze on the gun doesn't send grease through the zerk, 
something is wrong (yes you are doing this lifted off the ground right).  I 
grease spindles before installing.  On old spindles I have sometimes found 
that removing the zerk and scraping gurk out helps, but more likely the old 
grease is plasticy and you just need to remove and dissassemble the whole 
sandwich.  I had one like that and didn't take it apart and eventually the 
kinpin got sloppy .   Ended up replacing that spindle, which could have been 
avoided.

Grease you bus's suspension  liberally and often.

&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 It is super-easy to grease the link pin zerks. But I cannot get enough 
 pressure on the gun to grease the king pin zerks. And I bet I'm putting 
 a fair amount of pressure in there (and I have a large sized grease 
 gun.)
