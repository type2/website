Subject: Re: [VB] Vacumn leak

on 3 and 4 there is little or no change in rpm when you remove the spark?
This means that when the spark is present these are not powering the engine.
So look for the cause of no power being produced from these cyls. How about
compression? Try a compression test.
The sound you hear when the engine is running may be coming from a leaking
valve. How about a burned valve or dropped valve seat? Just my 2 cents.

&gt; I had believe my motor ( single port, 009, 30/31, AS21 case, blah blah )
has
&gt; a vacumn leak.  It has never idled well unless fully warmed up, and I
_think_ I can hear a sucking sound on the 3 &amp; 4 cylinder side.
&gt;
&gt;       So.. tonight I was fiddling around with things and I was pulling off
the spark plug wire on each cylinder
&gt; If I pull off cylinder 3 &amp; 4 spark plugs wires, the engine hardly changes
idle.
&gt; If I pull off cylinder 1 &amp; 2 spark plug wires, the engine will stall.
&gt;
&gt; Do I have a vacumn leak? If so, were do I look for leaks, I tried
tightening down those pesky nuts on the single port manifold to no avail..
