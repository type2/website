Hi Les,
Get the tranny.  It only has about 12 bolts on the CVs that would need to be
removed, 1 shift rod coupler bolt, and 6 tranny mounting bolts.  You should
easily remove it in less than two hours.  The 1973 and later type 1 tranny
have the 3.875 ring &amp; pinion that you could use when you have your bus tranny
modified for higher speed.  The rest of the 1973 type 1 tranny will come in
handy in trade to your local tranny rebuilder who will be happy to get parts.
The only special part after that you would need then is a differential from a
1967-68 type 1or 2 swing axle tranny.   Eric &amp; Barb
