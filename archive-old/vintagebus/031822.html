I have one of those big buck Miller spot welders with a timer, yadaa yadaa
yadaa (Seinfeild was just on the news). I got this when I was restoring
Porsches and have only used it on the rockers of a bus, awesome I must say.
When doing Porsches I had different sets of jaws made to reach closing
panels and to the center of the floors (3 feet long). Couldn't have done the
cars right without it and we used to challenge people who came in the shop
to detect the replaced panels. We also used a TIG to butt weld all sheet
metal panels and hammer welded those then metal finished. When all said
welding was done we used LEAD to finish all area, as per factory, then
finished the body with a FULL shim coat of evercoat plastic filler, blocked
down till metal was visible at all areas, costly process but worked
excellent. In the future I am going to reopen the shop to this kind of metal
work, already have 2 rotisseries ready to rock and roll, now if I could only
find the time and get my good body man back!!!

ronnie,  to old and busy for bodywork, except my own

ps. I got carried away (memories) but invest in the best spot welder you
can, buy some copper rod and make some jaws and put your BD back to original
shape. Also invest in a few hundred KLICKO's to help hold it all together
while you weld.

Anyone have any experience with spot welders?  There's a Hobart 115v model
that looks promising; it's $360 on the Harbor Freight site, $450 on the
Eastwood site.   The problem with these is you have to have access to both
sides of the work, which won't work for large areas like the cargo floors,
front floors, etc.  There's another one which works with an electrode
welder, and will work from one side, but I don't think it works with a wire
feed welder.
