 Sorry for the site error. It's on Evererts VW Planet page. Got an email
from a friend who said he bought the bus last Sat. Mad at me now. Don't know
why Mike emailed me Mon. and said it was still for sale. First time on the
list in months and I got a friend pissed at me and give the wrong site
address. You guys work it out with Mike. From what friend said the bus in
rougher than pictures give out. O'well I'm out here before before I put my
foot in it again.

John Howard
