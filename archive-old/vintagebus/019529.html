&gt; Out of curiosity why both?  I thought one or the other would do the same
&gt; thing alone?

The CDI works by storing 'lectrissity (capacitive) until it gets the signal
to let it all go (discharge).  That's a crummy explanation but it's the 
basic idea.  Instead of feeding the coil 12V, it feeds it a _lot_ of volts
all at one time.  That's why it has that separate wire coming off for your
12V stuff, like idle cutoff and choke.  It'd probably be really festive if
your idle cutoff, nestled really close to your fuel supply, got put in the
coil's power loop by accident :-)

The CDI works without Pertronix, but it works even better with it.  Without it,
the points just signal when to shoot all that voltage into the coil.  Because
of the slightly different operation I understand the points don't really wear 
out (except the fiber rubbing block, you have to adjust the points for wear
here).  Regardless, I use the Ignitor.  To quote Mr. Hoover:

&quot;...you've just eleminated a lot of mechanical jitter that is present in most
old distributors.  The jitter is still there but the triggering method used
by the 'Ignitor' masks it.  No more points-bounce.  In fact, no more points,
period.  Your plugs are now being fired in response to an electronic signal
that is far, far more precise than any mechanical switching arrangement.&quot;

Works for me :-)  And if you do call Universal, let the list know how it
goes...I've heard they're really civil about replacing their units, but that
was a couple of years ago.
