I didnt have a &quot;57&quot; sticker on my 56 plates and had no trouble registering 
them at the DMV.
I now have the correct sticker, but it was not attached or presented at the 
time I registered them to the vehicle.
Not sure if this is the same everywhere...or whether the cleck had no clue 
what was being done (VERY likely)

Black/yellow 63 plates CANNOT be registered to a car because they reused the 
plate/numbers sequence on the blue cali plates.
About five years ago people were getting smart and would get &quot;personalized&quot; 
license plates with the same sequence as the black plates....then people 
would just run the black plates instead.
DMV wised up eventually.

&gt; Black plates, sure, if you have the correct plate and sticker to go
&gt; with the car.  Dealer's plates?  I don't know.  Are you a dealer?

Nope.

On *California* plates:

On &quot;63&quot; plates, you can only use them if they are already assigned to the the 
car.
DMV has changed the rules, and you can't use YOM plates for this vintage any 
more.
These are the black plates with yellow letters.  If you have them on your 
car, 
I suggest you keep them.  You can't go back and forth.

YOM=&quot;year of manufactore&quot; relating to the specific set of rules for using
old plates on old cars.

&quot;56&quot; plates are yellow with black letters
&quot;51&quot; plates are black with yellow letters, and are wider and shorter than
what is now standard
&quot;50&quot; plates (if you're so lucky) are yellow with black letters and are the
same form-factor as the '51 plates

On &quot;51&quot; plates and &quot;56&quot; plates, you can get the plates assigned to your car 
*if*
* You have *both* plates
* They are in good condition
* the Year sticker matches the year of the car 
  - if you have a '58 car, you have to have the 1958 sticker.  If you
    don't have the sticker, you can sometimes buy them from license plate
    dealers.  DMV does not have them and they are not repro'd.  The stickers
    will run $30-$60.  They are painstakingly peeled from old plates.
  - '51 plates used a small metal tag stamped with the year, which goes
    over the right lower corner. These tabs will run ~$25 or so.  Same rules
    apply as for stickers.
* the current registration sticker goes on a small metal tab which is affixed
to one of the mouting screwes/bolts for the plate.  It is *NOT* supposed to be
kept in the glove compartment.  The new format for these stickers is a 
half-width
sticker for the month, and a half-width sticker for the year, which are placed
next to each other on this aluminum tab.

There are companies out there who can restore your plates to like-new 
condition for around $100 a set.
