&lt;&lt; Should I bother?&gt;&gt;
Hi Art,
YES.

&lt;&lt;Can anyone recommend the right re-build kit and source?&gt;&gt;
Any Vw shop should have them.  Most kits cover a wide range of VW carburators.

&lt;&lt;What problems should I anticipate?&gt;&gt;
Use spray carb cleaner and expect to have to clean it at least one more time 
soon after running it.  Crud that you will loosen, but not get out often 
comes loose and causes problems soon after.  Not a big deal, just 
dissassemble, reclean, reassemble, and install.

&lt;&lt;How do I get all the grunge and accumulated crud off?  &gt;&gt;
Carb cleaner will do most.  then you could always use tooth brush and sap for 
the rest of the outside.  We have found phosperic acid good at loosening 
corrosion in the passageways of the carburators and getting the one way check 
balls working again.  As long as you do not let the acid sit for more than an 
hour or so in the carburator.
