Subject: If you have a VW WEB PAGE please read

[...]

Suddenly there is an epedemic of automated requests sent to this address
which does not exist:

	VINTAGEBUSREQUEST_at_TYPE2.COM

The evidence argues that somebody put list information on his web page
within the past week and didn't quite get it right. If you have put &quot;how to
subscribe&quot; instructions for this list on your web page recently please
check your work. Subscribe requests should be sent to the address shown in
the footer of this message, which is different from the above because it
has a hyphen.

Thanks.
