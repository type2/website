&gt; obviously wrong.  My theory is that either the front right brakes are
&gt; pulling harder than they should or the front left brakes aren't working as
&gt; they should.  I that possible?
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
Yep.
Pull the left wheel off and see if there is fluid or oil. replace as
required
