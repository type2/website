Subject: Fw: volkswagen license, who would have thought.....

Hey Folks,
From time to time I read of some of you thinking of starting a web site or
club or whatever with the name Volkswagen or bug or again &quot;whatever&quot;
in it. Just came across this in another site. I didn't believe it at first
but
I checked it out and it's for real. Hope this isn't a repost, I'm sad
to read it, even though for me it's a first time.
