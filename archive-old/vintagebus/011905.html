&gt;pop bottle problem is to come up with a way to duct the cold air under 
the
&gt;rear seat back into the engine compartment and engineer it so that when 
you


During the winter, I ran a blower motor from a late model bus. The 
intake came from inside the bus under the rear seat and ran through the 
place where a gas heater was once installed. It blew air through one 
heat exchanger. This allowed the heat exchanger to heat pre warmed air 
(air from inside the bus) and lessened the pop bottle effect. The air 
from the blower on the engine was spliced into one the other heat 
exchanger that went to the front of the bus. The result was more air in 
front, and recirculated heat in the rear.
