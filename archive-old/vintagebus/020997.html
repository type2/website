Subject: re:[VB] Contest Winners and Non Winners? 

Ol No name Mark accused me of &quot;sharing DNA&quot; with the
winners. Ah, not quite! and not EVEN close.
I did on the other hand notice that the Powerball
winner from Kentucy or whatever that backwater State
was looked a whole lot like the character in my past
VanBondo cartoons.
Maybe now he can afford a nice West Coast bus.

Time to kill the contest thread before it smells like
tranny fluid on a damp/humid driveway
