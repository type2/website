I have heard that there is a auto insurance policy available called an &quot;agreed
to value&quot; or something like that.  Basically you and the insurance company
decide on the value of the vehicle when it is insured.  I believe this is
mainly for antiques.  Seems like a good thing, especially for folks with
emotional / sentimental attachments inanimate objects, not that I would know
any ;-)
