&lt;&lt; The gates are very straight, even tho it was used on a farm (has TX farm 
truck plates), but when theyre folded down, you can see the rust eating at 
them. Not
 on the body side, but on the long channel used for the &quot;frame&quot; of the gates. 
Is it possible to replace just the channel or do I need to start lookin for 
gates? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Any steel body part can be made with time, money, a welder, and a little 
sweat.  In the case of what you mention it should be a breeze to do.  Though 
you will have to have some kind of rust treatment done to them afterward to 
thier insides or end up where you started.  We are probably going to have 
ours galvinized by hot dipping.
