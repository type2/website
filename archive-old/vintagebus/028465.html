Please just read the whole post before jumping to any conclusions.

Can anyone tell me if a late 60's Porsche engine (I don't mean type 4) will
EASILY fit into a bus? Other than that 3 piece case they look real similar...

I have a 64 bus but I have no good engine (rod through the case). Buying the bus
cleaned me out so it's on blocks until I save the funds to build myself a top
quality 1600dp. In the meantime, I would love to drive this bus. I've had no
luck in scrounging up a VW engine for free, but... yes, an offer of a genuine
Porsche engine. Who would have guessed? Too bad I don't have a Porsche. Do you
think I use it until I build an engine that doesn't require $900 parts?

I would like to think that there are people crazy enough to have put Porsche
engines in their VWs. Anyone know how it worked out?

Thanks,
Joel
