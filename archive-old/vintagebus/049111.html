&gt;There are two ways you can go.  One way is to machine the groove into
the
&gt;new case and use an old style plug.  The second is to use the new
style
&gt;plastic plug, as is done on all new production engines.

George, Ronnie, Rennie, John and Matthew all provided responses, advice
and some more questions.  I have located a rubber plug source (PN
040.101.157) and will try that approach instead of having the case
machined to fit the metal plug.  Hope I don't live to regret it.

One thing concerns me.  One of you mentioned &quot;glue&quot; for this plug.  Is
there something besides the Permatex case sealer I should be using to
hold the rubber plug in?

Other than this little glitch, the Brazillian case has seemed OK so 
far.  Kind of a rough casting on the outside, but the crank and cam
bearings all fit in fine with STD bearings.  10mm studs for the oil pump
and the oil cooler.  Case savers in place to accept 8mm head studs. 
Threaded mounting &quot;nut&quot; on the left side for bolting to the transaxle. 
Not sure if I like that, I got used to D-bolts and pulling the nuts off
in front of the fan.  Extra casting and threaded holes for &quot;rear&quot;
support which I won't need.  Dual pressure relief set up, so I have to
provide the extra valve, spring, seal and plug.  

Thanks again to all who responded.
