&gt; &gt; Stop without turning the steering wheel. Then slowly turn the steering
&gt; &gt; wheel and count the &quot;o'clocks&quot; to left lock, then to right.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Make sure to do this with the front end jacked up just enough to have the
&gt; front wheels off the ground.  This makes it easier to move the steering
and is
&gt; alot easier on the steering box.  We also try to only turn the steering
when in
&gt; motion which puts less stress on the steering box.  Since steering boxes
are
&gt; getting rarer and $$$ for a rebuild you might as well take it easy on that
part
&gt; of your bus.

Not very likely to happen in an alignment shop
where the tech has never seen a link pin.
And you will surely get the long stare when you
tell him to be sure to put the weight of the driver
into the driver's seat to set the toe/camber correctly.
The primary alignment specs must be performed
with the suspension fully settled.
Then correctly recenter the steering wheel.
Then reverify the alignment specs.
After training the tech who did it wrong to correct his error
( not easily done through a thick plate glass window :)
it would be wise to go to another shop to have the job verified.
Or just do it yourself ! Either way, it could take all day :)

This particular problem arose when the tie-rods were installed
incorrectly at the vw repair garage, then the steering was
corrected (incorrectly:) after a new drag link was installed.
What do you guess happened here, and how best to correct it ?
