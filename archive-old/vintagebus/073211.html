&gt; Would not it be easier (not to mention better
&gt; looking) to just replace the
&gt; stock gauge w/ another stock gauge? 6 volters work
&gt; fine w/ 12 volts and they
&gt; are pretty plentiful. Seems like alot of work to
&gt; plug a hole when mounting a
&gt; guage takes 5 mins. and then the hole plugged
&gt; properly to boot.
Actually I didn't realise they were the same item.
What do you have to change? The light globe? Anything
else?
I type 2 specialist I know would probably knock the
price down on another one if I swap the one I have
when I get a working one.
