Well I made the remainder of my trip without many problems, the rain lightened
up a bit(so the bus dried out some). 18 wheeler flipped on the turnpike, thank
god I wasn't any where near it when it happened. rolled into NY sunday night,
just intime for my brother to make me some dinner(he is a great chef) then
slept a couple hours, and off to boston moday morning around 5:45 am, so I
could pick my friend up at the airport at 10 am in bostn as promised.

all in all the driving was not as great as the stops...
