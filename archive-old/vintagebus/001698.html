     I'm in need of a single port intake manifold for a 1600.  I have tried
     one source with very bad luck.  It wasn't even close to fitting
     correctly.  And yes, I know they rarely if ever fit nicely but this
     one was WAY off.  Can anyone refer me to a source that they know from
     experience has good manifolds?
     Thanks.

     Also, the loud clunk from the tranny that I've been bitching about for
     a while now turned out to be the front mount and shift coupler both
     being bad.  Whenever I shift, the linkage hits the frame.  This is
     good news that I don't have spend money on a transaxle like I thought.
      Thanks to all of you who offered advice and wisdom.  You enabled me
     to solve this puzzle once and for all.  It required my being under
     there while my wife worked the clutch and shifter to see this
     happening.  I was fooled before by the noise travelling to the rear.
     This would also explain why the front seal is leaking.  This will
     still turn into a redux rebuild but I can handle that.
     Ray
