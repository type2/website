Subject: Jerome,off road journey

   If anybody going to Jerome this year is up for an adventure, read on. The
ever FAMOUS VW Howard is planning an off road adventure to Jerome this year.
We will leave from Lake Havasu, AZ. and head to Jerome on dirt roads. He is
mapping out the route with minimal highway driving as I type. This is not
for the faint at heart, but for the TRUE bus driver. We will be leaving
Havasu at 6am Thursday before Jerome starting the JOURNEY. Spare tires and
gas are a must as we will be crusing through some of the most beautiful FALL
desert that will ever be seen. We will go as far as possible on Thursday,
camping in the wilderness Thursday night, then heading into Jerome Friday
am. The back route into Jerome is a spectacular drive, going through cattle
country, a river and a really old trellis bridge crossing. You will see a
quarry were all that slate rock comes from and numerous other generally
unseen sights.
   Anyone interested in making this trek with us please e-mail john
vwhoward_at_uneedspeed_dot_net , or me at  ronnie_at_oldvolks_dot_com  . We are looking
for an exciting trip to start off the Jerome weekend.

Ronnie
