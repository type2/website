Hi John,
Yup!  That way when the grease is no longer lubricating properly the graphite 
will greatly help.  If one does not have graphite around in a nice tin, one 
can sift it out of pencil sharpeners and any large pieces of pencil lead can 
be filed (Make sure the file is clean and do not use sand paper to do this 
cause it would add abrasive sandpaper grit to the graphite you are trying to 
grind down.) down to a fine powder.  Yes, pencil lead has been made out of 
graphite for many, many decades.
