Subject: Re: [VB] pulley ratio

&gt; Hi Joshua,
&gt; That is what we found recently and posted to the list.  The only way to get
&gt; higher ratio that we know is to install a 356 Porsche generator pulley and
&gt; shorter than 905mm belt.

OK then. Where is a reasonable source for 356 pulleys and which belt? Will
the conti 900 work?
