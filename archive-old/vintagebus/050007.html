Subject: Oil temps and Bosch ramblings (was: Splitty air scoops)

&gt;  The Tinkertoy ran
&gt;&gt; cooler up to highway speeds.  If the air temperature was less than 80
&gt;&gt; degrees the oil temp would remain under 120.  Ran real cool in town.
&gt;&gt; However the dark side of the scoop would reveal it's nature.  Running at
&gt;&gt; 60 mph for 15 minutes, she'd heat up to 180.  Run 65+ for 15 minutes and
&gt;&gt; she'd hit 210.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Without the scoop I have noticed the following.  She runs warmer in
&gt;&gt; town.  The oil temp averages about 140.  At speed, oil temp climbs to
&gt;&gt; 180, but stays there even at 65 mph.
&gt;
&gt;..you know, running around at 120 oil temperature is kinda tto cool.  You
&gt;want it to be up to 170.  It's like goldilocks and the three bears, you
&gt;want your oil not too hot, not too cool.   Guess you don't have a
&gt;thermostat in there, they help the motor warm up quickly (and you get more
&gt;heat in cold weather)   I'd say your temps are better w/o the scoops.


I was thinking that the oil temps have to do w/ the location on the sender.
I haven't got my Bug's elecrical system sorted yet (wiring harness replaced
by Filipinos somewhere along the line...), but after I installed a new set
of VDO guages I noticed an unbelievably cool oil temp, even on the highway.
My oil pressure was super low as well, and erratic, so I'm waiting 'till I
get all of my electrics working properly before reaching any conclusions.
Both of my oil senders are in the location of the original oil pressure
switch.

Oil should certainly reach 220-230 when your engine in warmed up, minimum,
or else the moisture won't get boiled out.  Look for that scummy whitish
stuff in your oil cap if you make a lot of short trips w/out getting the
engine hot.

Hey, this reminds me:  My Bug has an oddball Bosch alternator:  It has a
metal Bosch ID plate on it, and it says &quot;Made in Brazil&quot; and &quot;30 Amps&quot;.
Maybe it's a 3rd world only part?  I asked a couple of Bosch dealers here
in the States about it, and they said they never heard of a 30A Bosch
alternator, only the 54 amp which came on US models.

Oh, one more thing:  US Bosch dealers say that there are no Platinum Plus 4
spark plugs available for air cooled models.  Guess what?  It's BS!  Those
plugs may not be listed in US Bosch catalogs, but they're available
elsewhere, and for less!  They cost about $6 each in the States, but I
bought them at my FLVWAPS in the Philippines for $3.75 each.  I think I'll
hog up a bunch and sell 'em on Ebay.  The way stuff goes obver there, I
might get $10 each for 'em...

But seriously, next trip over I can take orders from interested members of
this list, and I'll pick up some Plus 4s for ya'll.
