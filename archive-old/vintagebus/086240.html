&gt;&gt;  Look at your dist rotor, it will be pointing to #1 to  FIRE. If not, move 
your plug wires to match.   &lt;&lt;



Hi Volks,
Make sure that the #1 plug wire is in the correct spot in the cap AND the  
rotor is pointed at the #1 notch in the distributor when you find # 1 TDC.   
Since the mid 1960s the distributor points lobe for #3 cylinder is slightly  
retarded to keep it running cooler.  So if the distributor or the drive for  it is 
set wrong and you time your engine, # 1, 2, &amp; 4 will be advanced  more and 
engine can run too hot.
