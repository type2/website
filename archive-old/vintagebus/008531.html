Subject: Seat reupholstery, need springs

I'm in the process of reupholstering the front bench seat in my '55 Kombi
and am in need of a few seat springs - 4 short ones (3&quot; tall) and 4 tall
ones (4&quot; tall).   Can these be purchased new?  I tried my local upholstery
shops, a few on the Internet, and a few auto upholstery businesses with no
luck.  Most said to just slap a fat piece of foam in there to compensate.

Or does someone has a scrap bottom seat they could pull some from?  They are
the 'big' springs ('58 and earlier only??).

Also, where to buy the new vinyl?  I called Wolfsburg West and they were
nice enough to admit they do not have upholstery with the 'correct' early
Bus pattern, which I want.

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
