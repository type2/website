Subject: re: RE: [VB] Protractor-toting-torsion-bar guru needed 

&gt; Does this sound like a good plan? One thing that confused me about the rear
&gt; torsion proceedures in the library were the references to inner spline
&gt; adjustments. Since it is a circle with equal splines around it wouldn't all
&gt; the adjustments be made by the spring plate's position on the outer bar? In
&gt; other words, aren't the inner splines adjusted exactly the same on both sides
&gt; when the plates are removed from the equation?
&gt;

The number of splines on the inner part of the bars is different from
the number on the outer part. I don't remember the exact numbers... This
allows you to move the outer adjustment one way (say 2 splines), then
move the inner adjustment the other way for fine adjustments. I haven't
actually done this procedure myself (though I intend to), but I've seen
it done on a Ghia and understand what's goin' on... Doesn't look that
complicated.

Borrow a Bentley manual (even one for a Bug), and it will explain how
the adjustment works.
