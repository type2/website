&gt; I applaud this attitude!  BBB is a wonderful event and it's more about bus

And I second both of your attitudes!  Even though events like BNNTA are
strictly (and strict isn't the word) a VW Bus/okay if your aircooled VW
anything event, events like our Bustoberfest are opened up to any VW or in
the case of one VW wannabe - an Isuzu pickup.  The main thing was that we
all had fun, all had a basic interest in VWs and I for one don't regret for
one minute that we allowed everyone to attend.  True, our event was small
enough we couldn't afford to turn anyone away, but still - it has always
seemed to me to be overly materialistic and snobbish to not allow people in
because of what they drove.  If they put for the effort to attend, and have
an interest in VWs, it should be &quot;come on in&quot; with open arms.
