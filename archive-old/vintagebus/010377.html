Subject: Rex's 59 bus won't start.

Rex - when I've had problems with no spark, it has been caused, in times
past, by:

Bad condensor
Condensor not properly grounded
Wrong dizzy cap (there were short and tall ones made throughout the years)
wiring to coil hooked up in reversed polarity
try jumping a wire direct from the battery to the coil and see if you have
spark to elimate the potential of a switch failure
Battery cables on backwards
No gound strap
Old/bad wires with broken connections under the wire
