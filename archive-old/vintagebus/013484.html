Is there anyone going to Jerome from the Lone Star? Or
just goin to be passin thru on their way? Im planning
on takin the B*g w/camper trailer in tow. (dont ask)
Lookin for a few volks to hookup with on the way:)
Planning on heading out on the 9th PM, or 10th in the
AM....... Never been before, sounds like a hell of a
weekend:)
