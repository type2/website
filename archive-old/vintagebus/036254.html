In a message dated 98-10-23 09:39:29 EDT, you write:
Hi Markus,
&lt;&lt; Does the oil cooler adapter use a gasket?&gt;&gt;
No.  Not if you are using the term gasket correctly.  Which is a paper or
other thin material that is very 2 dimensional in it's measurements compared
to it's thickness.
 
 &lt;&lt;My books don't seem to mention one but there appears to be one in the
 &quot;complete engine gasket set&quot;.  They do mention those o-ring-like things
 with the steps &gt;&gt;
The O-ring with steps is what you use for dog house cooler.  The earlier
coolers used a seal that looked more like small sections of rubber fuel line.
