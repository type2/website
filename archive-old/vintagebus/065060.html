Subject: Re: [VB] SOUND DAMPNER?

The &quot;silencers&quot; I would guess is the insulation that
VW put on the heater ducts under the bus. They were on
the outside of the tubes, not in the tubes as that
would restrict airflow rendering the heater less
effective than it already is! I am sure someone has a
pic of it somewhere, maybe on David Mayes' site?
