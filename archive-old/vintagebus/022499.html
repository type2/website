Subject: should I sell the '56?
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990402184949.00958270_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I've been thinking of selling the '56 lately.  With the '55 camper
occupying my time, and the 911 fulfilling daily driver duties, *plus* the
'54 in the $hop, I don't think I can reasonably support 3 buses.  It sits
forlorn, covered in the back, all but forgotten.  I went out and started it
up yesterday, and after about 3 tries, it started.  It hadn't been run in a
couple months!

One issue is how much to ask for it.  I have only seen a couple other 56's
in the past year or so, and they were serious projects.  This bus is just
about turn-key.  I will need a new sunroof cover, and I never figured out a
headliner solution.  It has all the correct lights, reflectors, bumpers,
nice paint, and only infintessimal rust: a couple small spots of surface
rust have developed in the battery tray, and a couple on one door.  There's
some paint blisters under the windshield, but I don't know if they're rust
or crappy prep from when I had it painted a couple years ago.  It has a
1600 single-port with a new 30-pict carb and a governor.  Rebuilt
transmission and new clutch.  New reduction box bearing$.  Very recent new
brakes.  Tires are decent.  Has those cool mudflaps.  Has safaris.  Also
has a sapphire I radio and an ambulance fan.  Late-model westy bed and
electric fridge (works, but you have to bring a 12v battery to the party)
All carpeted inside.  A very comfy and quiet bus to drive.  Looks better
than 95% of the buses on the road.  All keys match except ignition, which
I'd had to replace a couple years ago.   Brand new Optima battery.  Still
6v.  Has crank start option, and it works, although it takes a little more
ooomph than the 36hp in my '55.
