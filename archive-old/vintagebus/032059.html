&lt;&lt; i have Telefunken that is also 6/12v . i was wondering if anyone has 
experience in the changing of the voltage. i went and changed mine by way of 
screw terminals that are movable and a diagram inside the radio and 
powerpack,but after doing so i realized there are also tubes and relay type 
things that are labeled 6v. will these need to be changed also??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
We can not say for absolute, but if is anything like the Blaupunkts we are 
used to you only need to switch the outside leads as you seem to have done.
