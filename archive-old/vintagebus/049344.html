Subject: '59 Westfalia Pics Are Up

Looks like the list is working again.

I just put up a few more pics of the *finished* '59 Westfalia.  Sorry =
about the photo quality, but I seem to have lost my touch with the digital =
camera, or it's time for a new one.  Threw the family in the camper and =
took it for a cruise for the first time yesterday.  It's a reality!!!!  =
And here I thought 60mph wasn't obtainable in a camper with a stock 36hp =
in it.  Maybe the fact that it's an all NOS motor has something to do with =
it, but 60-62 mph seems really comfortable.  Still missing a few bits on =
the interior, but I know Ronnie is working feverishly to get those for me =
well before the Fall OCTO meet in October.  Right Ronnie??!!!  :)

The pics are up on Thom's site:   www.vintagebus_dot_com

Go to the Gallery, and do a search on:    robert davis

I'm also going to put them up on your site Everett, might as well help to =
clog up two VW websites.

Robert
