    A friend of mine wanted to get a pair of front windshields because his
 Izzi Safari's are not holding up in the cold and rainy seattle weather.  
 Do you have a set of windshield that he could buy or do you know of a
 company(other then BFY who he won't do biz with) that does sell the
 screens?  He'd like the logo'ed glass but if you've got a repo that would
 do. Cash is waiting!  In Seattle area is great but if you've got something
 and are out of state but willing to ship then
 contact me and I'll let him know so you guys can strike up a deal. 
 
 Also, Does anyone know how to remove the Emergancy flashers light on the
 63-65 dashboard? It's commonly refered to here as the &quot;BRL&quot;=big red light.
 Any help would be great!
  &gt;&gt;
yes, safaris in the PNW suck.   even originals.  I would get some cut at a 
glass shop, it would be quicker than waiting to find some originals.   you do 
need a template.  yes the originals are better- correct metric thickness, and 
also the corners are always made better.    You could call Bow Wow or ? other 
VW Flaps and see if they have any repros in stock.

RE the BRL on dash, you reach around unde rthe dash and unscrew it.  Can be 
rusty stuck.   Takes same bulb as dash lights.
