Subject: Re: [VB] Re: todd hill caper

 From that article, I can see why anyone would have entrusted their 
transaxle to him.  I got on the list in '99 with my first bus, but 
every time I've heard his name, it's been negative.  I found another 
site with  a negative message about him

&gt; http://members.shaw_dot_ca/sharkeysgarage/ToddHill.html

But enough of the negative - I'm considering selling my 65 EZ Camper, 
which I've gone through completely over the last two years.  Finally 
ready for the road, but now tranny has gone south.  I need someone to 
convince me that starting over with a DC project would be worth it.  
I've always wanted one, but here in CT, Splitties are a rare breed, so 
to sell one to get one would be a leap of faith, probably involving x - 
country shipping.  What are the five best things about owning your DC?

&gt; If my memory still serves me, that was written back around 97-98, 
&gt; before his troubles started.  He was quite active on the list at that 
&gt; time.
