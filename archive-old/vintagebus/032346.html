Hello;
I have always used a homemade puller consisting of a piece of angle iron 
(8&quot;-10&quot;) with a hole drilled and tapped in the center, a longish bolt to 
fit the tapped hole and 2 loops of nylon webbing (old seatbelt material 
works good for this). This setup has always worked well for me.

&gt;  the latter, where is the best place to get it... &gt;&gt;
