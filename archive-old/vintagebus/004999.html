 Just got my copy and it is one of the best bus books out so far. No tech.
info but tons of great pictures. Like the one on page 29 of my 58 Binz
Crewcab ( now sold)  and the one on page 90 of Ronnies BBB paint bus that is
below Rusty Richards bus. It is worth the $29 bucks, so get it. Ronnie has
some on order or get from any book seller.
 Went to see the guy with the 54 panel out of the pool and he still isnt
around. Talked to some of his neighbors and they havent seen him in about 4
months. Most think he is in jail again, passed out my cards and told them
there was a finders fee if they see him and call me. Took some great picts
of the rear area with all the custom work, will forward to Everrett when I
get them developed and he can post on his page. Taillights are 66 Impala for
sure, mounted up and down to follow the rear 1/4 shape. Side scoops and
flared wheelwells all mold into the molded taillights. In its time (mid/late
60's) it must have been a super custom. It even has real metal flake paint
job. Metalic silver and green with yellowish/green flames in the upper panel
area. The owner told me he had it painted at a place called &quot; Paint by
Molly&quot; who was one of the early customizers and custom painters in SoCal.
Maybe this BD should be left  or restored as is, as it might be one of the
1st ever custom buses. Kind of like Jerry Jess's Bessie.  The custom work
looks 1st class to me. The interior is all stock but for the wood steering
wheel. The semifores are molded in, but you can see the cracks around
opening so they must still be in there, the flames start right about where
they are. No rear bumper as it would not fit around the 66 chev imp
taillights. Thats it for the 54
  The 57 panel is coming along ok. Rear engine access door is in ( out of a
late type 3) and the walkthru section is tacked in place. Got all the doors
aligned and still need to replace left dogleg area. Removed top rear louvers
and replaced with sheet metal to give it the factory walkthru look. Not
trying to pass this off as original and I am taking a bunch of pictures of
each modification to show anyone that is interested. Will cut and weld rear
spare tire bucket this weekend to finish the walkthru stuff.
  All for know as I have to go with Denise tonight to the 1st day of her
25th high school reunion, day 2 Sat night.
She graduated here in Lake Havasu and I did go to her high school graduation
with her before we were married. Time flies, married 25 years next Jan.

Hope to see you all at BBBIV in Jan. Ronnie allready has some super raffle
prizes.
