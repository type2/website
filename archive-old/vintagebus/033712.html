   NQ just called me and informed me of the Buskatour progress. They are
currently on I 40 and hwy 95 (just 20 miles from Havasu) but don't think
they have time to come down and visit.
   Richard (aka rustybus) and Dawn (PLF), Rick Taylor, Rob are all
caravanning together.  Dawn blew the engine in her bus which is now being
towed by Rick, Richard is towing Ricks trailer (scamp) and it seems they
decided to tow Dawn's bus another 150 miles to Flagstaff instead of leaving
it here in Havasu (will make for a very slow trip being it's up hill all the
way to Flagg from here).
  Besides that all is well except Rob had a problem with his bus which
turned out to be the points closing up, a little adjustment and that was
fixed, (that's why I use a Compufire).
  As soon as they can get to a computer they will up date the whole trip
report, hundred's of pictures still to upload and a whole book to write.

Ronnie  keeping you posted
