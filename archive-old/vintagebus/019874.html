nope those ain't the ones- you tend to see the mirrors we are talking about
more in europe and se asia


I was browsing e-barf and came across this 1960 VW Bus ad
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?
ViewItem&amp;item=1133994993
Were these the mirrors that the list was talking about 
earlier?
Geeez those put the uuuggg in ugly! (No offense if you 
have them or just paid $200 for a pair of ROS ones ;)

BTW- If anyone is leaving the Fresno area on Friday 
afternoon for BYOB let me know!
