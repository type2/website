&gt; You have a whole plethora of options here:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Take your ass to Jenny Craig or equivalent.
&gt; 2.Take you're ol' lady to Jenny Craig or equivalent.
&gt; 3.Find a fat chick to ride with you to lower the high side...may take some 
&gt; trial and error, to find a chick with the proper weight to lower the side 
&gt; evenly.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow......just do some obvious but maybe overlooked possible factors- 
&gt; same tire size? same rim size?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it lower on one whole side, front to back?  Or possibly more in the 
&gt; front or back?
&gt; 
&gt; How do the shocks look?  Who knows, what some DPO did in the past...
&gt; 
&gt; 
   LOL.... :)   No, same tire and rim sizes. To me, it looks like it is the 
entire side, from front to back--I notice it both from the front and rear. 
The shocks are actually fairly new.
