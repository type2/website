Subject: Drag Link

David W thinks that I should install the drag link myself ... says it is =
easy and I shouldn't have a problem.  ONE QUESTION to David W and the =
rest of you out there ... is steering REALLY the best place for me to =
start learning about VW repairs ?? Will I install and/or adjust myself =
right into a ditch or a wall ?

Stopped at the parts store on my way home from work, their computer said =
they had one, but when they went in the back to pull it, it was labeled =
wrong, but it was actually something else.  So they ordered it for me.  =
Won't be in until Monday, maybe I will find one at another parts house.  =
Maybe I should just go under the bus this weekend and find it .. adjust =
it ???=20

Maybe John Muir has a chapter on Drag Links for Dummies.
