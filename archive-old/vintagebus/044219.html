Subject: Good Starter Advice, Thanks all

I posted a few days ago that I was sick and tired of crawling under my bus to whack the solenoid in order to start it, decided it was time for a new starter.  I was all set to pay $100 plus shipping for one from RMMW when a list member, a couple of listmembers actually, let me know about re-manufactured starters from AutoZone, $39 with a lifetime guarantee.  I called my local AutoZone up and they had one in stock.  Twenty four hours later and I have a new starter in my '66, It starts every time!  So, I don't want to sound cheesy or mushy but, I LOVE YOU GUYS MAN!! And for any rookies who are trying to decide whether or not to tackle this job (as I was a day ago) I say go for it, it's a pretty easy job, except that one bolt in the front of the engine compartment was a PITA!!!




Peace, John Baker
