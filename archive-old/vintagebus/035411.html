i bought a set of dollies a few years back , they are the flat floor kind 
much stronger than the ones from harbor.
they are more for the street rod crowd, but jack stands fit great they even 
have them for diff width tires (street rods)
i got them at a swap meet from the company vendor, but you can find then in 
rod rags. they were 4 for 169.00. and are much nicer than the ones in harbor 
frieght.ive got my 55 speedster up on them now with jacks and are very stable 
no movement at all.
