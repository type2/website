&gt; Seller has a ratty 55? bus which I think is a USA camper conversion of a

&gt; that is not my game.  So you conversion camper folks can ID: it has the 
&gt; awning windows (hinged at the top, open out) with glass radiused at the 
&gt; corners about an inch and a vertical mutton/mullion at the center of the 
&gt; glass.  

By the chassis # he provides, it would be a Feb '56 bus; By USA camper
conversion, it must mean someone in the USA took a saw, some plywood,
and a case of budweiser and spent the afternoon making a camper...

I don't see that many of the parts would be any good off of it, judging 
by the degree of rust and how beat up it is...
