Subject: RE: [VB] Transport companies

&gt; Also anything that isn't tied down will move around in
&gt; the bus.  My pristine paintjob was damaged and my bumper
&gt; was placed in the bus on the floor and slid all over.


I have a worse story that that.  Back when I was fixing up busses, I knew a
girl who had recently moved east from California.  She'd left her hardtop
deluxe microbus there and needed it brought east.  She'd been planning to
fly back later and drive it east, but since I was already transporting a bus
from near where she used to live, we were able to work out a decent price on
the transport of both busses, saving her the hassle and the airline ticket
cost.

On the way, the truck carrying our busses pulled over at a weigh station.
The state cop at the weigh station saw a Grateful Dead decal on the window
of her bus which contained a pot leaf in the artwork.  He decided that this
was just cause to search the vehicle for drugs or drug paraphernalia.  The
search was very thorough, and no attempt was made to avoid property damage.
They even cut open the back seat cushion with a knife to see if anything was
inside.  Nothing was found, but you can imagine how she felt when she saw
the condition of her bus on delivery.  Considering that she was 1000 miles
away from where it had happened, and hadn't actually witnessed anything
herself, she had little real recourse.  The truck driver wasn't all too
happy either, as it had cost him a couple hours of driving time and made him
late for another pickup.
