Subject:  RE: [VB] Original Safaris
Date: Thu, 17 Feb 2000 15:05:13 +1100

Sorta like a long narrow plate with holes tapped in it.
In fact, I was sorta wondering how people adjust
aftermarket safaris for fit without it?  Might actually
be part of the 'problem'.  The plate sits on top of that little
dent in the underside of the 'overbrow'.

You could get a 2mm thick length of narrow plate.  Lay against
safari (top) hinge and mark the holes drill and tap the plate.
Offer the safari up up to the bus.  Mark the hinge holes
on the underside of the eyebrow.  Drill 10mm holes here.
Drop the plate in the gap behind the bit the sunvisor bolts
to (its normally captive) inside the bus.  With a bit of jiggery pokery get 
the screws started in it.  You can then adjust the position
of the window plus or minus 5 mm in any direction (just
as you could with the originals....)

&gt; I was *unaware* of that!  Kinda like the plates for the striker plates, or
&gt; cargo door hinges?
