&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Looks like the front bench seat with the back piece having the driverside 
&gt; back curve built into it might have started at.
&gt; 27 OCT 60  Chassi No. 673 946     Bench seat in cab.  Now: Shape of cushion 
&gt; and back rest modified, both adjustable in three positions.
&gt; 30 JULY 62  Chassi. No. 971 550     Driver's seat.  Now: Seperate seats.  
&gt; Formerly: Bench seat.
&gt; So this bench seat for the front might have been used for two years (1961-62) 
&gt; instead of only in 1962 like we had previously thought!   Eric&amp;Barb
Hi eric and barb,

I could have told you it came in 61 as mine has it... it is a late 61 (low
hinge doors) but a picture can be seen at the following:

If anyone is curious, i can post the vin or chassis number tonight.

take care,

Steve
