nasa we have lift off!  and this one isn't going to crash on the surface of
the planet.

last evening i stopped by the shop and retrieved the original (late model)
distributor cap while asking that a rotor be matched to the correct cap that
i'd picked up last weekend.  i was on my way to visit with my mom so would
have to pick the stuff up on my way back - which i did.  i was very tempted
to go to it last night when i got home but it was about 10pm, i didn't have
proper lighting and i was feeling beat.  so in the pale light of early
morning, in my library clothes, i first tired the late model cap that'd
gotten me home.  it didn't work but the correct cap with the matched rotor i
picked up from the shop did!

there is a significant difference been the heights of the two rotors.  the
one that fired the truck up this morning is quite a bit taller.  the caps,
however, are identical save for the (look out, technical terms coming) metal
do-hickeys inside the column thingies that the wires are supposed to fit on.

so yet again i've had a volkswagen drive when it shouldn't have and yet
again i got hung up on the impossibilities of the situation and couldn't get
beyond it.  well, actually i guess i did get beyond it but it was with your
help!  thank you all for your suggestions!

i would have driven that bad boy to work today except for the fact that i'm
pretty sure the tank has next to no gas, the tank really needs to be
replaced with one that doesn't leak and one corner is up on a jackstand.  i
know what i'm doing my first day off of work... good thing it's tomorrow, i
don't think i could wait very long!

cheers,
