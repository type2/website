&lt;&lt; I've been lurking for quite a while and learning a lot from this list.  
But just
 recently I've started having trouble with the tranny in my '58 SC and I need
 help from &quot;the experts&quot; to get it back on the road.  A few weeks ago, while
 driving to a local show, I lost all but third gear.  Since the tranny had 
been
 leaking just enough fluid to make keeping it full a nuiance, (and since I 
doubt
 that if has ever been pulled .... 75,000 miles... original 36 hp and split 
case
 tranny), I decided to pull it and have it gone through and replace the 
bushings
 at the same time.  Over the last several weeks, I've been slowly getting it 
to
 the point of pulling out the tranny, (ie, engine out, brake lines 
disconnected,
 starter pulled, etc.), but I'm still not quite there yet.  Which brings me 
to my
 current problem.... how do I get off the 8 bolts (4 on each side) that hold 
the
 RGB's to the spring plate?  I gather from other posts that these are easy to
 break off, and I don't want to do that if I can avoid it.  I've been hitting
 them with PB blaster, but so far, the still don't budge.  I have a cheater 
bar
 but I'm hesitant to lean on it too hard.  Any suggestions from the masters of
 fasteners?
  &gt;&gt;
The bus is still sitting on its wheels on the ground right?   I use a nice 
long 1/2 drive ratchet with a 19mm socket and they come undone.  Never broke 
one.      Do clean up the bolts/threaded holes in RGBoxes and use a tap/die 
before installation-  it is easy to get them cross threaded when installing.
do loosen all the big nuts and bolts *before* lifing the bus off the ground 

Maybe unnesseccary, but I put a round from a tree under the U channel under 
the tranny for storage w/o tranny.   There was an decent earthquake  (while I 
was next to this set up) and all was safe.   Any one have buses on jackstands 
in No cal for last weekends earthquake?

while the tranny is being rebuildt is a good time to pull the rear shift rod 
and replace the two badminton birdie bushings in the shift tube.  Especially 
as the tranny has to be out to do that.
