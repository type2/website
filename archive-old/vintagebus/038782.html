Subject: Deluxe Poptop Westy-Thanks &amp; Another ?

Thanks for all the feedback on the SO-42/clamshell lights/Deluxe issues!  I
am still puzzled(not hard to do!) about the installation of the poptop in
the existing roof of the Deluxe.  If you look at factory poptops, there is a
very smooth curved bend in the roof metal that sticks up about 1/2&quot; around
the opening and has a crimped edge of the metal bent back to the outside of
the roof.  Then the canvas is attached to this &quot;curb&quot; at this point which
keeps the joint up off the roof and makes a good positive seal to keep water
out. My Deluxe has this same detail as other factory poptops I have
physically compared it too.  Can this be done in the field?  I have seen
some of the American camper conversions, and they didn't even try this
detail(just cut a hole in the roof and relied on caulking to keep the rain
out!) so I am perplexed as to how this would have been done by a PO at some
time instead of Westy?
Anyone have any insight on this?  On the other hand, the hole in the floor
for the water tank drain, appears to have been cut w/ a torch.  Would Westy
have done that?

Again thanks for the responses!
