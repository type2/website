&lt;&lt;  Seems like he has more attic and garage space than anyone. Every post has 
a NEW FIND in the attic or garage. How do you miss 3 nos bumpers in the corner
 of the garage?? and door paNELS IN THE ATTIC? Sounds like a %#$^ to me. Just 
move and get it over with. &gt;&gt;

Two story, two car garage previously packed to the gills, and 4 field busses 
stored around town.  If you read Erin's posts about stuff hanging from the 
rafters...well anyway, if you don't want to buy anything, don't.  ...but 
don't be one to gripe when ends up on Ebay.

For the record: *1* NOS bumper, advertised until it sold, which it did 
yesterday.
