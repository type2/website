&gt;I really want to drive the side loader single cab back from iowa/nebraska,
&gt;but have never had a long distance experience with a totaly stock bus!!! It
&gt;should be a blast as the bus has been totally restored (refreshed?) rebuilt
&gt;engine, new brakes, paint, interior, etc. so the ride should be nice and the
&gt;bus should make it, anybody want to meet me in Iowa and ride back to az.or
&gt;New Mexico, doing some wrecking yarding and bus hunting along the way?? Have
&gt;tools will travel.

When will this be happening?  Your customers in Omaha would love to have
you stop by whenever it is that you might be traveling through. The
Batmobile is really coming along and will be going to paint late this
month. I'm sure you would like to visit your sheetmetal.  By the way The
Omaha VW Club Show and Shine will be on Saturday July 15th at Flashbacks
Bar and Grill , 3015 S. 83rd Plaza (in the parking lot on the East side
of Flashbacks). Rob, NQ and I would treat you right. Might just give you
an incentive to stop by ;)
