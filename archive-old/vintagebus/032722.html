Well, I do have an extractor exhaust, the S&amp;S Hide a way street muffler S09,
hooked to an S-15 header using stock heater boxes. Slightly throatier than
stock, no louder, better top end revs, and the muffler tucks under the body
work on the right side. I had to modify it a little to get the heat risers to
work but it all works together.

Engine will rev to 5200 in lower gears (VDO Tach), but that scares me and it
gets hot (over 215F) if I hold revs over about 4200 (~70+) in 4th. Next plan
is to add the full flow filter with an external oil cooler and thermostat fan
in the leftside where the battery is on the right. Also plan to go to gel
batteries (primary and camping) to get rid of fumes and acid leak damage. plan
to have the camping deep cycle under a cabinet inside with large wire for
charging. Also maybe a remote CD changer someday. to dream to dream.
