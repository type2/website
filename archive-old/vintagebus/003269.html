Hey Pink,
  Every Tach I have hooked up went like this:
red- switched ignition source
black-ground
green-trigger wire (-side of coil)
white-illumination
Never had one with a blue wire! Anyone have any ideas?

&gt; Now that I've got the Rancho Freeway Flyer in my 66 Westy, I'd like to
check
&gt; my RPMs at speed.  Last yr. at a swap meet I bought a VDO tach (3 1/2&quot;
dia)
&gt; that appears to be unused (wire ends look unmolested).  My question is can
&gt; anyone tell me what the wiring set up is as I don't have instructions.
The
&gt; wires are as follows:    2 large ones - Blue and White    and 3 smaller
wires
&gt; - Red, Green, and Black.     Thanks in advance for the help...
