So I'll sum it up since it'd seem only fair..........

I think I wanted to defend those who share with us all the dream of seeing
and enjoying VW Busses.  It would only be fair then in assuming that
that there just isn't that much money in most peoples pockets that enable
them to restore and give away these wonderful vehicles.  If someone has
fifteen busses sitting and rusting in their yard, lets give them credit of
doing what they can to keep them from being crushed and beyond anyone's
reach.
It is a grief we all share when we realize the pain of the cancerous rust  or
the truth that it is falling slowly from the possibilities of every roaming
the byways of the world.

Do the positive and progressive thing of encouraging and participating in
keeping useable parts available to and in assisting those who for pities sake
needs it.  Cause unless you gonna buy it and pay for the resto of every bus
you see and then donate it, then say a prayer and move on.

May the Busma preserve us all.
