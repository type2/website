Subject: [VB] Welder ?


&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I am looking to get a argon gas MIG setup.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if anyone has had experience with a Matco brand 110v
welder?
&gt; Apparently it is fairly heavy duty with a good amps output (over 100), but
&gt; definitely will not be better or equal to a Miller or Lincoln.
&gt;
&gt; It is used (traded in for a bigger Lincoln unit) and comes with warrantee
&gt; from the seller.  Price $250.  When/if I upgrade I can trade in that unit
&gt; again for the full amount and apply it to the new units price.  Seems like
a
&gt; good deal to me, what do you all think?
&gt;
&gt; Of course I will need to add onto that gas, wire, mask ($200ish ouch - for
&gt; the flicker screen), and the little crud.
&gt;
&gt; I would have gone for a new Miller or Lincoln 110v, but that was like
&gt; $550... OUCH!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Adrian S. Pillow
