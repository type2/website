Hi all,
I have'nt thrown in my 2 cents for a while.
With keen eyes searching through photos of busses getting off cargo ships
and roleing off the factory floor I have deduced that mirrors were installed
at the factory depending on place of delivery.  For instance, several photos
I found of busses coming off cargo ships did not have mirrors, so if a bus
is delivered over seas via cargo ship then the mirrors were not installed at
the factory. The dealerships would then install the mirrors.

Next, I looked through photos of the factory.  At the testing bays right
before the busses were driven out to the holding lot some of the busses had
mirrors while most all did not have mirrors. All of the busses were at the
same degree of completion.  I would guess that only 1/5 had mirrors on the
factory floor.
It is deduced that domestic German models were installed with mirrors at the
factory while busses being sent to further destinations via ship, truck or
rail were not installed with damageable parts such as hubcaps, antennas,
wiper arms, and mirrors.
This is also evident with similar photos of beetles.
