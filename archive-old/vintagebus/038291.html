After experiencing brake fate in a hopelessly overpowered and underbraked
beach buggy I will happily allow my engine/transaxle to absorb as much wear
as necessary to prevent the same thing occurring in my bus.

On another note, I once had a water related problem with my brakes in the
dcab. On the way to a farm I waded the bus through a crossing where the
water level was about halfway up the wheels. As I crested the next slope I
touched the brake pedal and felt no slowing at all. I immediately crashed
into first and crawled down the slope(which happened to end in a hairpin
with a dense stand of pines beyond). There was absoloutely no discernible
braking effect and had I not touched the brakes at the top I would have
plowed into the trees and got a bellyful of steering wheel at least.

Has anyone else had a water related brake problem?

Later 

Michael
