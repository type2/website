My daily driver is up for sale. I am sorry to see it go. But it must sell.

1963 with 1 ton option suspension.
1600 Single Port, Tom Noble Rebuild, 60,000 miles on it, but toms engines 
are known to last.
Freeway Flyer Tranny by Rancho
Front end rebuilt 5 (i think) years ago.
New rear soft brake line hoses, new master cylinder.

Yes this is a small window rear hatch, with a 1 ton suspension!!!!!!!
Previos owners tried to make it a camper, so it has a zbed. It has a 
incorrrect pop top, and its not too pretty. No rear bumper.

I am selling it in the merits of great mechanicals, not beauty.

There is bondo, pmaail me for me info if inerested. This is a bus that has 
been a survivor. I want it to &quot;cover just a little more ground&quot; or I wont 
sell it.

Email me phil_friends_at_hotmail_dot_com


thats phil underscore friends
