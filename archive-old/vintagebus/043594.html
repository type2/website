&gt;Maybe I'm stupid but I have found that the 2 most encountered problems with
&gt;bus turn signals as been the fault of a dirty/worn Turn Signal switch and
&gt;bad contacts in the relay box.

Not stupid at all.  You've messed with a few more Buses than I have, so
while I can talk about book learnin', you can talk about the stuff that
actually works.  :)

&gt;Of course, the relay boxes were both replaced with Kymco's flasher relay 
&gt;conversion.  Damn - if they're going out of business, I better stock up
&gt;on those replacement relay boxes so I have a few around for future projects.

Or bay-window switches, or plain old relays.
