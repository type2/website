&lt;&lt; Actually SS suffers from anerobic crevise corrosion if dropped into the sea
 for a thousand years. Needs O2 to stay 'stainless', the chromium oxidizes
 and forms a protective layer. SS does gall, and that is a real problem.
 Good grade steel fastenings, put in with some never-seize woudl probably
 last as long in a vehichle. and SS fastenings are certainly not even close
 to original, if that is important.  Jim
