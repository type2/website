Subject: Re: [VB] VIN Woes

Nothing like this happened here in Illinois unless I just walked in there at the right moment....
when registering the 64 all I had in my hand were documents that said that the Bus has been bought
at the auction with no title. God title and registration with no problem.... and they have not even
looked at the Bus.... not even from a distance. Sometimes I just wonder about some of the City,
State or Federal employees...
