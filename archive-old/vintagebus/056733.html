Subject: Re: [VB] Security Device

All this talk about devices I've yet to hear some say there cars had alarms. 
With all the new alarms with motion detectors. at least you'd hear when they 
shake the car or move it. Really now I think our v-dubs are worth another 
200.00 dollars more for an alarm.only my thought .
