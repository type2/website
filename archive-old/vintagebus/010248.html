paying someone $10 an hour to answer the phone , and another $5 in 800
charges to take down address and lengthy orders,  doesnt help either,  and
those bulk mailouts, printing costs , and all that,  an organized system of
dealing with emails and web pages can save amazing amounts of cabbage
i saw one vw dealer on thier web page said &quot;phone calls answered
immediately, emails answered in 30 days&quot;
now thats cost effective

&gt;
&gt; &quot;More to the point, it's when cost of doing business exceeds profits,



With so many people
&gt; using the internet these days, it seems as though the huge magazine ads
&gt; should not be as necessary as in the past.
