&gt; not a bad idea to push a rag through the tube to kinda clean it out.   But
I
&gt; definately grease the tube and bushings as I put them in, dunno how else
to
&gt; lube it.

I put an old clutch cable in my drill and whirled that round it - cleaned it
up pretty good!  Then compressed air - but I think i will do that rag thing
too!

&gt;
&gt; I guess after cleaning the tube you could push an oily rag through the
tube
&gt; to oil it.
&gt;

Good plan - though I think I might get messy doing this job!!

Cheers
Paul
