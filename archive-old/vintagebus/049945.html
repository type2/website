Subject: Re: [VB] Still no parts from Performance Warehouse

&gt;Hey, Erin, quit yer whinin' and try these people
&gt;
&gt;Porsche Mailorder
&gt;135 17th St.
&gt;Santa Monica, CA
&gt;90402
&gt;310.393.5423
&gt;
&gt;They provided my venturis and jets, and it didn't take them
&gt;2 months either.


I didn't interpret Erin's post as &quot;whinin'&quot; at all.  I, for one, APPRECIATE
warnings or kudos regarding vendors.  If anyone has a good or bad
experience with a parts supplier, I hope they will post it to the list.
