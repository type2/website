Hi all,

I had to have my 1966 bus towed home yesterday from the place on the
freeway where the fuel pump push-rod wore out.  I bought a new fuel pump
push-rod at BAP that seems to be made of much better steel and which
has the cam end discolored from the hardening process.  The old push-rod,
that I put in 10,000 miles ago when I put this engine together did not
have a hardened end and obviously wore out because it was a poor quality
part.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough experience to recognize the
difference when I built the engine.  I got the part mail order but will
not mention the specific company.

I don't see any reason that such a simple but important part should
be made this poorly.  The 'good' part (we'll see...) only cost about
three bucks, not a big ticket item, nobody is spending or saving much
money here, why make a bad fuel pump push-rod?

Also, I don't see any recourse for the consumer.  I can call the the
mail order place from which I bought the part and complain but I doubt
that it would make much difference, shoddy parts such as this will
continue to be made.  I suppose the only way to combat this problem
is through education, if all the VW owners learn to tell a good part
from a bad part, nobody will buy the bad parts and they will stop
being manufactured.  This posting is my small effort in this direction.

Cheers,
