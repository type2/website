&gt; My 38 amp generator appears to have malfunctioned.

I could be way out here, but isn't the 38 A generator the one that has
the different tin on the front, to force air from the fan shroud through
the generator body?  If you don't have this tin I think you'd know it,
as the fan and/or belt wouldn't line up, but if you did manage to make
it work without the tin, your generator might be overheating.

&gt; [red light coming on, apparently for no reason]  I had replaced the
&gt; voltage regulator a few weeks earlier as I had upgraded the engine
&gt; to 12 volt.

Your Bus is rejecting the transplant.  I hope you kept the 6 V parts in
a cooler so they're still viable.  :)

Have you tried polarizing the 12 V generator?

&gt; I did try a test: disconnect the two wires from the generator. Connect
&gt; a voltmeter to the generator. They registered zero volts.

If the generator's not turning, this is the expected result.  If the
generator is turning, you may or may not see a voltage between D+ and
the generator body (D-).  You will probably see zero volts beteween DF
and the generator body (D-).

If you check at the generator with the regulator hooked up, the generator
turning, the red light out, and the engine at around 2000 rpm, you'll
probably see the system voltage between D+ and ground - something between
12.6 and 14.0 V or so.  You will see some voltage between DF and ground,
but it's hard to say exactly what you'll see - it depends a lot on the
state of charge of the battery and a little on your voltmeter.

With the regulator hooked up, the generator turning, the red light out,
and the engine at around 2000 rpm, you might measure between the B+ (black
meter lead) and D+ (red meter lead) terminals at the regulator.  You will
probably see a small voltage, less than 0.5 or 1 V or so.  If you see
much more than this, something may be wrong inside your regulator.

The Bentley has directions for a &quot;quick check&quot; of the generator without
the regulator that may give you some more information.

I recently ran across what I think is a fairly good description of how a
voltage regulator actually works.  It's on page 400 of the paper version
of AC65-9A, or page 14 of the PDF version at
http://www.airweb.faa_dot_gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/a563729e3daac121862569f1005f80f1/$FILE/Chap%209_pg%20387-428.pdf
