 Looked in my 1962 Mitchell collision manual and they only listed a 1 piece
floor replacement. 55 to early 59 was $12.83 and 59 to 67 was $15.46. Both
showed 5.0 hours to do the replacement and hour labor charge chart goes from
$3.25 an hour to $8.50 per hour, so you could have your whole front floor
replaced for around $40.00/$50.00 parts and labor. Times have changed. Will
bring the manual with me to Classic, ask to look at it. It covers all
foreign cars and some trucks.
