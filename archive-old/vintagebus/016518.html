Hey  i was reading through hot vw trends when i found out Bill Collins was 
entering his Heb into the race. Anyways i though wouldn't it be neat if we 
got a pre 60 or barndoor bus in this thing. Anyways since this is a friday 
topic. Does anyone in the vancouver Region want to save a splitty  i found 
one but space and money and the place were it is prevents me from buying it. 
Well happy friday. Oh yah and steve you gave me hope man
