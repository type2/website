Subject: Re: Queen of all strange bus sounds

  I've been lurking following Diane and her saga.  It sounds all to
familiar to when I got my 67 in 1980.  I'd take it to my mechanics more
often than I should have... and each time they would give it back to me
only for something else to break a week later.

  The road will fork with major decision in the future where Diane will
fix most things herself, find a honest mechanic, retire it, or discard it.
It is the way, grasshopper.

  Sometimes I look at mine and have to assume the posture that it is not
going to kick my ass, and I will fix it!!  I gave up on mechanics cause
they know they will break more pieces when trying to fix it due to metal
fatigue, and look at old cars as a liability to fix.  Most, don't want to
have to learn 50 year old &quot;tube&quot; technology, or buy parts from vendors
they don't have experiance with.

  Brother Muir has a way with hand holding VW owners hands to find the Zen
in yourself to do what you must, before you become financially and
mentally busted.  We are his followers, live and learn.

Best,
