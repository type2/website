I am looking for the bumper trim for my 61 15window walkthrough deluxe.
Also I need the
interior trim that goes on the panels. Idealy a complete correct set of
panels for this  model
year, am I dreaming? Bus is sealing wax red w grey interior. 
I am also looking for the  both the back seats.
Am I really dreaming or do these parts exist somewhere in type2 land??
