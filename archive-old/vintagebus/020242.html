The &quot;middle&quot; position *is* off.   The reserve tap fits the baywindow perfectly.

&gt; I am looking for a fuel tap for a baywindow tank i plan on putting in the
&gt; pickup... is there one that, in addition to the reserve lever, has an OFF
&gt; position? how about a non-stock tap that can use the reserve cable to shut
&gt; it off?
&gt; 
&gt; and as for that, can i use a split reserve tap in my baywindow :)
