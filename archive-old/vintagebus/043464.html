&gt;Anyway, my current problem (pun on current) concerns my horn.  It was 
&gt;not working quite right so I took it off and cleaned up everything last
&gt;week end.  Anyway,  I thought everything was cleaned up alright and I
&gt;pulled off my horn button on my steering wheel to check the wiring and
&gt;now - NO HORN!  

Was there a screw on the horn that didn't have anything to do with the
mounting bracket?  Did you tighten it?  If so, untighten it a little
at a time and see what happens.

You are correct in your assumption that if the horn button wire sparks
when you ground it, you have power to your horn.  If you want to be
really sure, grab a dome light bulb, roll under the Bus, pull both
wires off the horn, and hold one wire to each end of the dome light
bulb.  Have somebody hit the horn button.  If the bulb lights up,
your wiring is OK.

Your horn could be shorted, but since you mentioned &quot;cleaning&quot; it, 
you may want to check the contact points adjustment.  Usually this is
a little screw, maybe with a lock nut, that you can screw in and out
to vary the spacing on the contact points inside the horn - same idea
as adjusting the gap on your distributor points.  If you turn the screw
all the way to one end of its travel, you can keep the points from ever
opening, so the horn doesn't sound.

Good luck!
