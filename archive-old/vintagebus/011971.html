&gt; What a nightmare.....I bought a muffler from my local shop who told
me &quot;good
&gt; luck finding a Lietspict&quot; (how ever you spell it) and basically
convinced me
&gt; to buy the one they had.  Well I bought it, hook, line, and sinker
and man
&gt; did I have to do some fabricating....I think I could have built a
muffler
&gt; from cratch in the same amount of time.....WORST OF ALL I couldnt
get 2
&gt; bolts to line up so I had to leave them off (for the time being). 
You know
&gt; how there are the 2 nuts that hold it against the engine, those
fit.....but
&gt; the 2 bolts that mount it to those pipes (the other part that is on
top) I
&gt; could only get one on each side......anyways......4 hours later
everything
&gt; was perfect except for those 2 bolts.....I think I will take it to a
muffler
&gt; shop and see if they can get the other 2 bolts on.

A law should be passed requiring this post to be taped to every
Mexican and Brazilian muffler sold!

If the bolts you referred to above were the ones that attach the
muffler to the intake manifold heat riser, be sure that you (or the
muffler shop) modify only the muffler to fit.  Don't mess with the
intake manifold side or you won't be able to fit the correct muffler
when the one you have now rusts out in a year or two.

If I were you (and I was a few years ago!) I'd count this muffler as a
lesson and buy the correct muffler right away.
