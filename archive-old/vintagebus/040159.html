Dear List,

I will be converting my 67 single cab to IRS using 69 bus parts , this is 
not usual but I will be welding the whole 69 rear-end at the frame , this 
means I will use 69 trans. and will use the rear engine hanger of it too 
,but my T1 engine has no mount to attach it to hanger !! what can be done ? 
I heard a kit to use bug engine in T2 (68 79) busses this can work but where 
can it be found ? or can I make a mount attached to oil pump cover ?

thanks

Eren Berberoglu
