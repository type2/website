&gt;  ok i put them _at_ http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/ apologies for the size 
&gt; of the image. now yall can understand about the phillips screw i was 
&gt; referring to on the dash
&gt;  
&gt; 

oh, I see.  I have never seen that screw for a Sapphire radio installation, 
which is much more usual that the Emden or Wolfsburg  (made by VW)  In fact, 
the bracket in the installation instructions is NOT the same bracket as the 
more usual Sapphire radios came with.
