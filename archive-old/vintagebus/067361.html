Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

No need to cut any of the bus, or bug sheet metal, with an upright kit, they
fit in the stock engine bay.  If you want to sell your vehicle, but not your
type 4, just remove it and put in an underpowered type 1 and your stock
again.  

The upright type 4's even use the stock rubber engine seal.  That's what
sold me on the type 4's, nothing to cut, the vehicle is still untouched,
just a bit more &quot;spunky&quot; and a lot more miles between engine rebuilds.

 The european folks figured this one out a LONG time
&gt;&gt; ago, just takes us
&gt;&gt; &quot;yanks&quot; a little longer to learn our lessons.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Or maybe we think a little more about our cars before
&gt; busting out the sawzall!
