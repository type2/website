Hi All,

For all those that have asked...
The jacks are made from your typical handyman jacks, rated at 4660 lbs each.
The original bases were welded to new bases which have three casters each.
There is a lock screw in the arm of the base that faces inward that engages
the floor.  These stabilize them a lot and keeps them from moving.  Bars
were made with the same dimensions as a normal VW jack to fit in the square
jack point holes on the bus and welded to the original lift bar on the jack.
This bar also extends the reach enough to clear the side of the bus.  I can
still open the doors with the jacks in place but I can't lower the side
gates.

Realize the bus right now is completely stripped and I really don't think I
would raise a completely loaded bus up that high (i.e. trans, motor, etc.).
When under the bus, you can grab it and shake it. It does move a bit but
seems quite stable.  I would doubt very strongly the jacks themselves would
ever break.  I would not try and roll it when it's that high though.  When I
get ready to mount the front beam and transaxle, I'll lower it down some.

I guess if your jack points were not secure or rusted out, this wouldn't be
the best way to go.  If you want to be even more secure, you could probably
drill a hole a put a pin through the jack point and jack bar (like you do
for a side step).

email Roy at lintec_at_uwtc_dot_net if you want a set.

at
 least 40&quot; off the floor to more easily clean it.

Pretty neat but it strikes me as unsafe.  Maybe if the wheels of the stands
locked in place?

Can the jack points really support the complete weight like that (possible
dumb question)?  I just don't see anything to protect you if one corner
broke off or failed in some way.
