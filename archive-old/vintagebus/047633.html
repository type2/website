Guys, from what OG two tone buses I've seen the factory norm was from
Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
beltline. 59 and on the top color whether it be grey-biege, cumulus
white or whatever was painted over the entire bus and the bottom color
was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the beltline down.

Evidence can be seen when the OG paint fades and shows the base color
through i.e. the 20K SWR G-B 23 window at OCTO in June, you could see
spots of grey-beige coming through the sealing wax red. Then look at a
number of faded deluxes and standards and such from the 50's and you'll
always see the bottom color coming through the top color.

I have to disagree on when that was changed.  My April 61 deluxe is SWR/BG   
the SWR is showing through the BG on the roof.  Therefore the whole bus was 
SWR, then BG was added to the belt line.   

I am unsure of if they changed this and if so when. I don't know what year 
the pricey 23 window was.   This paint layering  been discussed before, but 
.....

What i am sure of is that the inside was painted the bottom colour till about 
the end of 61.  There for the dash and the overhead vent and the edges at the 
top of the cab door where it shows ove rthe panel is the lower colour.   I 
had to replaced the drivers door, after it got hit :(, and used a  SWR door 
from a SWR/BG 63, which has the top inside edge BG, a small detail, at least 
it does not look patchwork on the outside, just ratty.
