&lt;&lt; Hi all,
 
 I think I found a nice bus right here in New jersey.
 It's a 76 lime green automatic. I'm going to see it at
 3pm today. The owner said it gives off blue smoke
 which I've read means it is burning oil. Is this
 caused by a serious problem? About how much will it
 cost to fix? Are there any specific problems I should
 be looking for with this model year or with the
 automatic? Thanks for any help you can give.

I'd find a reliable ACVW mechanic and get them to check the bus out, 
including a compression check.   blue exhuast means burning oil which 
probably means bad rings and the bus needing a rebuild motor.  Around here 
that cost about $3500 to get it done.  
You should try posting to type2_at_type2_dot_com, which is for 68 and later AC VW 
type 2s, the vintage bus list is for talking about the older buses with the 2 
flat windsheilds and the bar down the middle betwen them.  The type2 folks 
would have betetr suggestions about a 76.   Good luck finding a nice bus  :)
