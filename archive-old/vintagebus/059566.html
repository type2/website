Subject: Lost VB messages....

Three ways to go... Go into Digest mode so you'll lose 10-20 posts at a =
time when AOL screws up. Get a Yahoo or Hotmail account. Or go direct and =
read 'em at www.type2_dot_com.=20
Sending money to an ISP who screws up is like buying more bus parts from a =
bad vendor. Don't encourage 'em!

Bus content... Went to a beer festival in Anderson Valley, CA. At least 6 =
splitty's camping out in the brewer's area. A sub-hatch Westy, double door =
panel from a cider company. My brother's '66 Riviera and the AVBC =
&quot;co-founder's&quot; '67 Riviera and others.  My DC is down with valve train =
problems so I caught a ride in a rented stupid-big 2002 domestic doublecab.=
 How stupid-big you ask? We cheered to find it egged after the festival!=20=
