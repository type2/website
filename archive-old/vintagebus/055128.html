Subject: EMPI Christmas Bus

   I just recieved the pictures of the NEW EMPI Christmas bus (Johnney
Lightning). This time around I will take pre-orders with either a C/C number
or pre payment. These are available in both plain and mag wheel style. This
is a limited edition with only 5000 or 7500 being made. They are 30 dollars
for the pair shipping included.
  You can also order just one in either style for 15 dollars, shipping
included, with pre payment. 
  This will probaly be the HOTTEST JL bus evr made and a great Christmas
gift. Delivery is expected the first week of november so plenty of time to
get before Christmas. 
   I am sending a copy of the pics to both VW Planet and Vintagebus, so you
can see them there.

thank you
