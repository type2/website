Subject: RE: [VB] Safari Windows

Jerry,

I local fellow here just installed the Wolfgangs and they look and work
great.  I believe his came bare and he had them painted at a local shop.
Very nice touch that I hope to add someday to my Bus.

Good luck
Gary
Austin, TX

Still haven't heard from anyone whether they have had any experience with 
Wolfgang or Bus Boys Safari's. I can't seem to get a reply to e-mails from 
Creative, and it doesn't appear that they offer polished frames.
