Wow, 6 days off the list! Busy week. Oly,

You want to spray a lite feather coat at the 2 and a half hour point.
First, one very lite coat, then apply another coat very lightly over that.
Apply a third very light coat, so that the black POR shows thru like a
shadow. Then just let the whole affair dry. If the POR dried to a crackle
finish, somethings wrong. POR drys to the form of the underlying surface.
My first thought is that the POR reacted chemically with something on the
surface. The Metal Ready wouldn't cause that. It would have to be some
kind of organic solvent-based substance under the POR.

Try sanding it all back and start over carefully following the post I sent
some time ago, and/or the ones in the archives that I posted years ago. Or
try following the POR directions.

&gt; OK,
&gt; I obviously did something wrong while treating the rust around my
&gt; windshield prior to replacement with the POR15, probably waited too long
&gt; to apply the primer.  I thought I had to wait til it was dry but still
&gt; could dent with fingernail.  That was longer than 4 hours, I thought due
&gt; to cool evening last night.  No matter...the result was the crackle
