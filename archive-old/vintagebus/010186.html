We ancient ones with long histories of involvement with funny little furrin
cars agree with Mr. Gensler's &quot;TRUTH&quot;.

These vehicles were designed to be driven at full throttle at all times.
Speed changes are to be accomplished by changing gears.  [With 2 obvious,
and usually involuntary, exceptions.]

There are occasional situations involving the ascent of steep gradients
where speed is impaired in spite of WOT and enthusiastic gear changing.

Encounters with massive immovable objects may impede one's rate of travel
despite WOT and manic manipulation of the gear selection apparatus.

&gt;&gt; Many unenlightened people believe that the pedal that your right foot
goes on is a gas pedal.  But I know the truth!  It is actually an on-off
switch.  Up is &quot;off&quot;, Down is &quot;on&quot; and anything in-between is boring.  When
switched on, you have achieved WOT (a.k.a. wide open throttle) and are ready
to venture forth into the world, Grasshopper.  (Any who don't believe me
haven't ridden with me!!!) &lt;&lt;
