Subject: Re: [VB] Allstate Single Wheel Trailer Clamps?


&gt; Was thinking this Karma had something to it til I
&gt; got in my car, turned on 
&gt; the air and hit the passenger side window button.
&gt; Krunch!  window came off 
&gt; the rail, darn.

Dude, dont complain. You scored a trailer and in my
bus I have to reach over and pinch this little chrome
thing to open my windows. And I never have been able
to figure out my A/C.
