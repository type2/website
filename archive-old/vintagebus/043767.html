&gt;My question: As stated it's a '66 bus with a 1600 DP engine from a '71.
&gt;Which starter should I get? I believe it still has the original 6 volt
&gt;starter because there is a strange little box\transformer thingy wired
&gt;in line just before the starter (I'm guessing a voltage drop??)

It's possible that somebody put in a voltage drop (2 wires) for the 
solenoid, but I'd say it's much more likely that that is a relay (3 or
4 wires) that a PO installed to cure a hot starting problem.  My '64
Bus came to me with one of these and I think it's a fairly common fix.

If it does indeed have a 6 volt starter, then I don't think you can just
slap a '71 12 volt starter in there, because the teeth on the flywheel
are different.  http://www.type2_dot_com/library/drivetra/sixto12.htm
has somewhat of an explanation on it.

&gt;Should I get a 12 volt starter for a '71 or get a new '66 starter and 
&gt;keep the voltage drop thingy there.

Before you start messing with the wires, disconnect the ground strap
at the battery.

If the rest of the bus is 12 volt, and the mystery box is a relay, you
shouldn't need it anymore.  To get rid of it, you have to find the
original wire from the ignition switch in the front of the car.  It
should be the thinner of two red wires that come out of the original
harness right by the starter.  Unplug this original red wire from the
mystery box and remember it.  Now, disconnect all other wires that
go between the mystery box and the starter, and lay the box and
extra wires aside.

Right now, you should have essentially two terminals at the starter:
a stud and bolt with up to three heavy wires on it, including the
really big one from the battery positive, and an empty push-on
terminal.  OK, now change the starter out for the new one, and
transfer all the wires on the stud on the old starter to the same 
stud on the new starter.  Then, find the original red wire that
you remembered above, and plug it on to the push-on terminal on
the new starter.  Hook the battery ground strap back up and try it!
