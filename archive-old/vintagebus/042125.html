&gt; Most powdercoating product requires a metal

&gt; and hold the material.


A surface does not have to be metal to accept a static charge.  I'm
sitting here  looking at a picture of myself with about a 400kV charge
charge built up in my Physics class.  My hair was definitely standing on
end and I don't think that I was made of metal!
