&gt; I recently purchased an NOS Blaupunk AM/FM/SW radio.  I want to 
&gt; put it in the '55.  Doe anyone know how the antenna needs to be
&gt; configured for shortwave?  Does anyone actually broadcase on 
&gt; shortwave anymore?  Or is SW something other than shortwave?

Yes, there's lots of activity on shortwave.  Lots of news services and
Voice of [insert name of country here] broadcasts.

The normal antenna will work, but reception won't be super.  Shortwave
propagation varies widely with time of day.

Can you read the frequency range for the SW scale.  If it's in the
3-30Mhz range it's Shortwave.
