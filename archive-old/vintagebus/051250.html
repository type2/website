Subject: Re: [VB] Difference in Engine Lid Lock 66/67

From: &quot;Dave&quot; &lt;brooksdj_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

&gt; What it seems had happened, the latch on my decklid came from something else
&gt; (who knows what).   When I went to order one they showed 66 and 67 being
&gt; different numbers. What I've since been told that the difference is 2 bolts
&gt; verses 3 bolts.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have one for sale?

Strange.....mine was the same. 3 screws, two piece. 
I have not seen a 2 screw lock. Either 1 screw or 3 screw. 
One piece or two piece.
Tell me more about how the 2 screw one looks and works!
And which one are you needing?

&gt; &gt;  I used the 67 lock, it works fine.
