Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

Craig,

Already tried that! The genny spins fine and quiet both directions. I'm
wondering if the sound could be internal engine stuff, and mostly I'm
wondering if one could hear anything like this sound from outside, if it
were coming from inside.

Thanks though!
