Chapter 2) In which our hero and Rosie attend the OCTO Meet

    Awoke early (5:15) Saturday morning, against my better judgement, but
knowing it is best to arrive early to get the goods at the swap. S, S &amp; S,
drink feeble motel room coffee, try to gather all our belongings. Harry
trekked to the local AM/PM for breakfast pastries. I'm not good on an empty
stomach and apparently neither is he. Mario von Salzen arrived at our room,
less than well rested from a night in his Westie next to an all-night clang
and bang pipe manufacturing plant. I went out to check on Rosie, relieved to
find her unmolested. We gathered our wits and drove the 4 blocks to the site
of the OCTO meet. Many splits already in attendance, many more arriving.
Fortunately there was no line to get in, Rosie and I selected a centrally
located spot while Karl and Harry (being not in a split) drove to the
'other' parking lot, and walked in.
    Unpacked folding chairs, affixed my ID tag, and made a brief foray into
the growing crowd. Very quickly, I became aware of the fact that I had
created a dilemma for myself. I was strongly drawn to the swap, tempted by
the many and varied buses present, and yet felt compelled to stay close to
Rosie, as very few people would recognize me, even with my ID tag, and I had
instructed everyone to find me with Rosie to pick-up their ID tags. Damn!
After 30 or 40 minutes, I found Harry and Karl. At least we could do an
informal tag-team, alternately manning the station at Rosie and wandering
around to check out the sights. Next time I'll just hang the tags on the
side of the truck and go about my business.  Before too long, I found
vanBondo, the only listee I would recognize anyway. He was, of course,
surrounded by a small crowd of fawning admirers. After all, the '54
Barnambulator is a possession  worthy of awe and envy.
    I wandered about the show for an unknown period of time, rotating
between the swap, the buses and Rosie, all the while looking for the listees
to whom I had mailed ID tags. Soon found listees Matt &amp; Katie
(my59kombi_at_aol_dot_com), Chris Dreike, David Woo, Matt Henricks with Steve
Harris, Chuck Covington, Dave Gillingham and Rennie Wible. If I forgot
anyone, accept my apologies, I was dazed and confused. I think I like
meeting the people as
much as seeing the buses. I found Dave Easterwood manning the NEATO booth,
introduced myself and took the opportunity to join. That guy has some big
huevos, driving his Barndoor all the way from Georgia!
    While wandering around, looking at the buses, I realized I should be
taking pictures.
Went back to Rosie, realized I had left the back door unlocked, got into my
backpack, my camera is gone! Sh*t! Well, that's what I get for leaving her
unlocked, but I always expect better from a VW crowd, especially bus people.
Decided I was not going to let this setback spoil the day. (In case I never
finish this series, I found my camera when I got home, felt like a real
idiot!)
  The morning wore on, inspecting buses, talking to lots of people, trying
to listen to the raffle numbers in case I actually won something, but much
too distracted to succeed. Bought a repro grab handle and license light lens
and gasket. Karl won a knee protector which he gave to me, cool! Every time
I go to a show, there are more and better repro parts available. Who woulda
thunk it?
  As the show was winding down, I tried to get my locks rekeyed by Gabriel,
in hopes of reducing the number of keys swinging on my ring. No luck, repro
rear door handles don't disassemble. Talked to Dawn from PLF about a bra for
Rosie, she said to send her color chips and she will match the colors as
close as possible. Looked at some of her work, nice stuff. From more than a
few yards away, you can't tell there's a bra on the bus! Think I'll order
one.
  Finally tore ourselves away and drove back to the motel to pick up a bus
toy that Harry had left in the room, then over to the brewpub where he had
promised to buy all listees a pint.  Had a lovely lunch and a few beers with
Harry &amp; Karl, Jim &amp; Paula Ellis, Matt &amp; Katie, Chuck Covington, and Richard
(Rustybus). It was nice to get a chance to sit and talk without all the
distractions. On our way out, we stopped to admire the Rustybus. Quite a
piece of work! Each of us contributed something to the decorations, then hit
the road.
    A short distance towards the freeway, I found Karl and Harry pulled off
at a used car lot. There, featured on the raised display platform, was an
early bay crewcab with fresh red and white paint. It was not perfectly done,
but nice nonetheless. A salesman came out and proceeded to ask us questions
about the vehicle! Karl was becoming interested, bordering on tumescent. The
asking price was $6900. At least it was realistic. After a little more
drooling, we dragged Karl away and headed for the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
Irvine.
    Arriving at the hotel, the parking lot was a show in itself. Having been
the site of the toy and literature sale, many people were staying over for
the Classic. After checking in, we came down to the parking lot to find lots
of socializing and tailpipe sniffing going on. The Van Bondo's were holding
court in one corner of the parking lot, trying to be inconspicuous, but
failing. Met a young man named Rob (I think) who had flown from Ontario,
Canada for the show. Somewhere along the way he had lost his return ticket.
He was toying with the idea of buying a nice restorable California split and
driving it back instead of getting another ticket. Ahh, the innocence of
youth! There was a time when I would have..... Walked to McCormick and
Schmick (really) for a very good if somewhat expensive dinner, served by a
young lovely named Brie (really). Back to the hotel for some much need rest
before the Classic tomorrow.

That's enough for now, hope I can finish this, assuming anyone's reading it
anyway.
