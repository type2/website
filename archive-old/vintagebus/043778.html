&gt;Well the tach itself doesn't have anything on the back but 4 wires.  2 of
&gt;them go to the bulb socket (I guess this is ground and bulb power)

If you can pull the bulb socket off the tach (like changing the bulb)
and the wires come with it and don't stay connected to the tach, then
yeah, these are the just the illumination wires.

&gt;and then 2 more wires come out of the tach.  One is black and grounded to 
&gt;the chassis of the tach and the other one is green.

Black one goes to ground (Bus body) and green one goes to the same
terminal on the coil as the wire from the distributor.  This is
a direct connection, not inductive.

Some tachs do need power to run and some don't.  Most of the hand-held
tach-dwell meters work just fine with just two connections, signal
and ground.  Tachs that need power to work are probably doing a little
more signal conditioning inside the tach.

I found these two links the last time this question came up.  These
are for VDOs but they may help.
