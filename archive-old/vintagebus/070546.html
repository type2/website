Subject: camp trailer for sale/ was: New Splitty Hitch

For those who need more sleeping space I'm going to be selling my 67
scad-a-bout camp trailer. Class three hitch not needed. Smaller than a puck
but big enough for someone 6' 2&quot; to sleep in. sleeps two. The rear opens up
to form a kitchen with stove top, sink, and ice box. I have the original
side tent in decent shape as well. New tires and bolt on valve stems. I just
took a trouble free 850+ mile trip to the red woods with it. Asking $1900. I
will have pictures of mine later this week, for now it looks similar to this
one http://www.teardroptours_dot_com/7thBIGPIX/LarsonDB.JPG
&gt;
&gt; Not an Airstream, but it is aluminum clad and from 1952.  Way too heavy
&gt; to yank around with a 1600, but the DC made it the 40 miles down to the
&gt; Classic and back two years ago.  A bit nerve wracking though.
