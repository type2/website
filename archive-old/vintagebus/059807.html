Subject: Re: [VB] Heater knob - busted!

I think this needs to be clarified. My '65 DC came with all silver gray
knobs. I'm pretty sure they haven't all been changed from black ones. Does
anyone know if this was true for earlier commercial vehicles (i.e., pre
'65)? Maybe black knobs with a different color interior?
