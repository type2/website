Just got my engine in, and I'm in the process of lining up the wiring.  My 
generator is giving me some confusion though.  The wiring diagram I picked 
up at Thom's shows a D+ terminal and a DF terminal on the generator.  Mine, 
however, has a B+ terminal and a D+ terminal.  This B+ doesn't come straight 
off the battery does it?!  And what should I do about the non-existant DF 
terminal?  Has anyone else experienced this?  I can grab some numbers off it 
tomm. if needed.
