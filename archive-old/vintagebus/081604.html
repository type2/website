Subject: Re: [VB] Easier ball Joint Replacement?

There was one made years ago called a &quot;Time pirate&quot; that allowed you to
remove and install ball joints while on the vehicle itself. Not hydraulic,
but required a big impact gun to do it. One of those &quot;cool tools&quot; for sure.

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; Anyone have experience with this method of ball joint replacement. I got
it
&gt; off the RAMVA list and the poster is one of the experts on the list:
&gt;
&gt;         A properly equipped shop has a hyd tool which can swap out ball
&gt;         joints on a Bus without even removing the trailing arms.
&gt;         May take some phoning around.
