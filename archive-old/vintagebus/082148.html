Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

In addition the DCs came with strips of the same material as the headliner as the trim strips between the panels, 4 strips in total, 

the SCs came with metal (painted grey) triim strips between the 2 front panels and the rear panel.

&gt;Hi Robert,
&gt;
&gt;It's always nice to see progress of your project.
&gt;
&gt;The double cab headliner is in 4 pieces... the front three are just like
&gt;those for a single cab and then there is a large piece for the rear.
