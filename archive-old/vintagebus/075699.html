You CAN keep one that long - you just have to want to! ;-) I never had any
reason to get rid of it. Besides, we've been good friends for so long,...
well, you know!

If you hold onto and do the work on your bus, it *will* teach you some
things about life. There's no doubt about that. No one who does the work
on their own car for a long time gets away without learning something
about their life. Hehe!
