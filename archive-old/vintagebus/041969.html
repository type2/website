&gt; The London Bridge Bullis (a neato chapter) puts on BBB  every year, this is
&gt; the fifth event coming up  January 19,20 and 21,2001.
&gt; It started as a bus show (number one), then became open to all VW's, over
&gt; the years we have weeded out anything but Type 2's and have talked about
&gt; making it a split only (only talked) and decided to leave it as is, OPEN to
&gt; any VW transporter, regardless of year.

I applaud this attitude!  BBB is a wonderful event and it's more about bus
_people_ than it is about buses, from my point of view!  While my Bay
doesn't have the snob appeal of a splitty, it's still a great vehicle
and I'm glad that there are still events that aren't splitting hairs over
this issue.  There are a number of events that are much closer to home
that I do not attend because of their poor attitude toward folks who are
not precisely &quot;OKD&quot;.

John and Ronnie put forth a huge amount of effort and deserve unending
applause for it.   I've done events for
other types of groups and know that the effort goes up with the square of
the number of participants!)
