Subject: Burnt Clutch??

We've been having tons of road construction of late and there are only
two north south roads to get around Long Beach Airport which sits
between my daughter's high school and home.  We live in the center
between the two roads.  Normally I take the east route, which for the
last 6 months, has been chopped up down to one lane for road replacement
work.

Today, I got a little tired of it and thought I'd go a little out of my
way and take the west route.  This one takes you up and over Signal
Hill.  Wouldn't you know it that they choose yesterday and today to
resurface a 2 mile stretch of this street.  The first half is UP hill
and the second half is a sloping downhill.

It was not the time to find out that the hand-brake needed adjusting and
could not fully hold the DC from slipping backward.  What fun and
excitement it was, bumper to bumper traffic, no way to bail out, no
place to bail out to.

Before I got to the top of the hill, you could smell the clutch.  By the
time I got to the top, you would swear from the smell, that flames were
roaring out the back of the DC.

It now seems that I've got a nice slip in 1st and 2nd, while pulling
away from stops.

Never having burnt up a clutch before.......

will the glazing/burnt surface wear off and go back to gripping with
time.... OR
am I now in line for a clutch replacement???

My nose is still smarting from the smell
