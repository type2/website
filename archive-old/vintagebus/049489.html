Subject: Re: [VB] waco bus

the bus was not crushed, at least during the raid - tho many other cars and
trucks were.  it was quite visible for days after the fire.  afterwards, i
believe it was hauled off, but the ATF and FBI folks  deliberately ran
personnel carriers, tanks, bulldozers and fire trucks over everything in an
attempt to confuse the evidence (Teaxs Rangers investigation), so maybe it
was flattened later.

I can tell you ONE  thing - I actually called the Waco sheriff's department
a month or two after the fire, inquiring about that bus.

THEY  WERE  &gt;NOT&lt;    AMUSED.
