Subject: Carabus for Bonnaroo aka Our own Bus Village :)

Only a few weeks away till this awsome event :))

So far plans ar to meet at the Wal-Mart on I-24 (if you are coming from
Atlanta, GA side, it is I-24 east, sorry I only know the way I go for
reference)
This should be exit 111?  Any confirmation on this.  It is the exit right
before the Bonnaroo only exit 112, (where they cut a hole in the fence of
the interstate and you drive straight in to the campground)

Every year they open the gates early.  The website/literature says the gates
open at 8am Thursday.  Last year, I heard they actually opened at 4am!!!  So
let's make plans to meet at Wally World by 2am.  They will let you camp in
the parking lot and you can pick up last minute items there also.  I am
unsure if this is a super Wal-mart, does anyone know that met there last
year?

I know some of you can't make it this early :((  But the earlier we get in,
the less we will have to wait in line and the easier it will be for us to
set up a Moonie campsite!!!  I doubt the people coming in late will be able
to move their bus in to our area late, but we will TRY to leave room for a
couple buses extra.

Shawn and David Bennett are planning on bringing a large Tipi, which should
help us find our campsite easier as the place gets crowded, and it will get
crowded.  If you have an idea for markers (flags, balloons, poles, etc) feel
free to bring them along.

Don't forget, bring lots of water, the drinking water they provide for free
sucks
:(  and the only facilities they have are port o lets and a wash station
with sulfur water :(

We also have the FMBC message board with everyone's listing if you want to
join a carabus at
http://fullmoonbusclub_dot_com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=232

If you would like to join a carabus or start your own and don't want to join
FMBC to post your info. That is fine. Just send it to me and I will post it
for you.  Or if you see someone from your area that will be attending ,
email them and hopefully y'all can carabus :)

I am hoping for a large bus campsite.  So please, if you are going ,
consider joining us. And if you already have plans for camping with other
non bus people. Feel free to bring them along also. We're not snobs and we
don't bite hard ;)

The music is but days away, but the memories will last a lifetime  :))

Until later,
Snoopy

PS: Could someone forward to other bus lists.  Vanagon in particular??
Thanks in advance.
