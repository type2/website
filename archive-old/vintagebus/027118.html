Subject: vinyl graphics

If it were my panel, I would go with paint and not vinyl. But then, I
would be painting it myself. Still, there is a quality to the paint that
should not be overlooked. It not only looks more original. . . it looks
better too.

But finding an &quot;old-timer&quot; may be difficult. There is a movement
underway to revive this old craft. The participants even have a
magazine. It is called &quot;Letterheads&quot;. I would suggest stopping in at
your local sign supply store and pick up a copy. When you see the
beautiful hand painted examples shown inside, you will be convinced that
paint is the way to go. And, from the listings inside the rag, you
should be able to find someone in your area that is practicing the old
ways.

Recently, I designed and painted a few signs for the inside of a friends
sub shop. I hand painted them all to give it that special quality I was
looking for. I would have made far more money by using vinyl. But I am
so happy that I didnt. The paint looks fantastic.
