So, once again, this list has had wonderful timing!

I too have been thinking about this lately....  I finally had to move the
gates of my 59 dc so instead of moving them, I simply just put them on!!!
doh! :-)

When I went to put on the stops, I noted from the '59 parts manual that the
front gate stop was indeed smaller and looking at my gates, they appeared
threaded.  I'll look better this afternoon.  The gates are the originals and
have the seam in the sides.  Rummaging through the remnants that I had
removed, I found no little pieces of rubber stops or any hardware that match
the manual.

My manual lists the following screw sizes:
4x12 cheese head screws (front side gate)
5x25 cheese head screws (rear and rear side gates)
5.8 mm washers where listed for the 5x25 mm screws and none for the front.
(I didn't right down the sizes nor part number for either of the stops... if
this thread continues, I'll post back if different)

I don't have the manual beside me but if I recall, the manual shows a single
cab and in the double cab section, there are no new specifics regarding
bumpers for side gates.

I have sets of stops from WW and 'autohaus_at_ebay' ('NOS' GBE).  They have
pretty much the same profile, much larger than a door bumper, and three of
the four bumpers from autohaus read GBE on the back.

The other thing that bothered me was the lower stops.  Looking at many
pictures a good number do have the lower stop and I'm sure I didn't remove
any stops from down there.  I'll have to look better on the back side to see
if there were originally holes there or not and also refresh my memory
whether or not the parts manual says anything about a lower stop.

I'm off to read the previous post on this thread... the quest continues.
