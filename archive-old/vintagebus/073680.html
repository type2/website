Subject: Re: [VB] Parcel tray full of water and dodgy speedo backlights

Don't forget to check your wiper shaft nuts and seals!  BTDT!  If a 
shaft seal is going bad or the outside shaft nut is loose, water will 
drip down the shaft into the cab and right onto the package tray, do not 
pass go and do not collect $200.  Or, the drops of water will travel 
from the shaft along parts of wiring inside the dash and then onto the 
package tray.

The problem of a recurring flooded package tray had me flummoxed (and I 
had just replaced the windshield seals) until I discovered a combination 
of loose wiper shaft nuts and loose old seals were allowing the driving 
rain to sneak in this way, drop by drop.

&gt; The front windows do leak onto the dash, and I can see small amounts of
&gt; surface beneath the seal - but I guess if the parcel tray is full of water
&gt; then there must be holes in the window aperture? Or could it just be leaky
&gt; seals causing the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; On a kind of related note, since driving it in the rain a couple of weeks ago
&gt; I now find that my speedo back lights do not function correctly - they began
&gt; flickering on and off however they are now permanently off.  The fuel gauge
&gt; light works fine, and if I remove one of the bulb holders from the speedo and
&gt; earth it separately it works fine - therefore I must have an earthing problem.
&gt; Thing is I don't know where the speedo should be earthed - is it just through
&gt; the two mounting screws?  If so I guess these need replacing - is it possible
&gt; to remove these without removing the dash tray?
