I'd just adjusted the valves about 2 weeks before KP, and did them again
after - they were a little loose, but I generally like them that way.
I did them a little tighter, which did help a tad on the noise, but it's
still there.

&gt;  sounds possible, but it is very unusual for a type 1 cam to lose the
&gt; rivets, especially if you have a dished cam.  have you checked valve
&gt; clearance?  i think when my cam went flat (non hardened, pos brazilian) i
&gt; had this problem you described, but i'm not sure.  i had to adjust the
&gt; screws about 2 turns just to get them correct.  of course i had to tear the
&gt; motor down and rebuild--after only about 1200 miles.  other than that,
&gt; don't know what to say without hearing it.  good luck.
