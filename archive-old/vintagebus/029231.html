Your email date is off there by almost a hundred years... just so ya know.
And the date in the browser reads 1969. Must be the millennium bug

I belive they were on busses from around the start of the new overhang
period mid 55' and later to about 64 or 65 when they went to 14 inch rims
with barely visible slots. They are 15 inch. I've heard and I am not
surprised that VW was making, stamping and outfitting busses with 16 inch
Barndoor wheels during the change over time, so there might be oddities from
the mid 55' period. The four slot rims are correct for these years on
busses. If you have smooth wheels those are bug wheels.

&gt; Forgive me I wasn't able to read up about all the crow's feet emails,
&gt; and then I couldn't access my Outlook Express and lost them all.  I just
&gt; looked and realized I have two crow's feet rims.  What years of busses
&gt; did those come on?  I have a 1959.
