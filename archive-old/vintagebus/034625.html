Subject: Going to Puyallup!!!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,
I'm going on a train from Eugene to Tacoma... I'll arrive in Tacoma at 8:47 
and will be staying at the Days INN in Tacoma... Only kicker is, my train 
leaves at 2:33 Sunday from Tacoma. Will it be hard to get a taxi from the 
fairgrounds to the train station in Tacoma (9 miles)... I'm hoping to get a 
cab or a ride there by 1:30 or so. Are cabs hard to get in Puyallup?
    I DID IT!!!! I'm going to be the 18 year old, about 5'9&quot; wearing a  BNNTA 
t-shirt(representing the midwest!), kid wearing a green Oregon visor... and 
probably carrying a suit case:) (does somebody wanna let me stash my bag 
under their bus so I don't have to haul   it around?) I can't wait to meet 
some listees...what time should I be there for the good swap pickings? 6am:)

Can't wait----should we all meet somewhere
Thanks for the call last night Eric!!!!! Your a good friend who Im gonna 
finally be able to meet!!!

Take care, I've got some packing to do!!!
btw---bring down your ambo fans, blaupunkt pull outs, and your bus 
accessories under 50lbs:) (stupid amtrak rules)...I'm in the market...

Later,
Pete
