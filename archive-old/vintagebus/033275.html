Hi John,
Interesting idea, but like Ronnie says too small of bore.  The front brakes 
have not one, but two wheel cylinders each!  We went through six repair 
manuals to make sure the 1972-79 bus dual circuit MC used the same bore size 
and it puts a rabbit, or pre-1972 Volvo reseviour,or 67 only bus MC reseviour 
right under the access fill plate in the 1955-67 bus.  Check our single to 
dual MC conversion info on the type2 library.  Eric&amp;Barb
