Hi List!

For those of you intersted in seeing pics of the VWoA show in Auburn Hills

http://www.vwrestoration.50megs_dot_com

Today I have only been able to upload a few of the type2 pics (forgot to 
bring all the disks!!!) so will upload the rest tomorrow!

Also you can see the pics of the new 74 b*g my wife just bought at the VWoA 
show from a fellow listee!!!!

Enjoy

Mike

P.s.   The show was great.  It was the first time my wife has been to a 
vintage meet and she really enjoyed it (how could she not...  she bought a 
car!!!)  It was also really great to meet some of the other listees.

P.p.s.  Dworkin....  Passed the split nose that was for sale and noticed the 
passenger glass was gone later in the day.  Where you able to talk her out 
of it?!?!?!?!?
