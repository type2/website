(physics lesson, run away!)

There are more atoms in a tireful of air as there are tirefuls of
air in the atmosphere.  Therefore, anytime you fill a tire with air you
are likely to get several of the original atoms that filled the vehicle's
tires at the factory!

You can also use this fact to show that with every breath you take you get
a lot of atoms from Ferdinand Porsche, Ben Pon, etc.  Unfortunately you
also get some from Hitler, Genghis Khan, and Jeffrey Dahmer so perhaps
this isn't a good concept to dwell upon :)
