&gt;parts to put it back together. This weekend I found in a junkyard a
&gt;windshield washer bottle
&gt;but the button on top is cracked beyond repair does any one know where I
&gt;can find a replacement
&gt;cap for it. Any information would be appreciated!


That is perhaps the most frequently asked question by people that find a
washer bottle in a junkyard. The most frequent replies being, in order of
magnitude, ME TOO!, followed by; use the bulb off a turkey baster, followed
by; I made one out of the wife's diaphragm, etc. ad nauseum. On and on it
goes, but you said you would appreciate any imformation, so this qualifies.
At this point, I am not aware of anyone repro'ing them, but you should check
with the usual suspects, BFY Obsolete Parts, West Coast Metric, Wolfsburg
West, Jim Thompson aka Sherwood Automotive, and the Bus Depot. All of these
maintain a web presence and can be located with an easy search.
