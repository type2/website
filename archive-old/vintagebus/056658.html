&gt; Is the vin number on the tag below the gas tank to the right??? I am trying
&gt; to figure out the VIN so I can find out whether the bus is a 62 or 63 . 

Hi Bryan,
That could be a 62 thru very early 64 (NOV63?) model.  The VIN should be on 
the plate on the right forward engine compartment below the gas tank, but 
that could have been easily removed and replaced in the past.  Try instead to 
find the stamped VIN number in the body on the right horizontial surface just 
forward of the rear apron.  This to could have been cut out and welded a 
differant VIN, but it is alot harder.  Since you are doing this also check 
the M-code plate behind the front passenger seat for the same VIN.
