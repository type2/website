 Well,

Thought I'd stick a comment in here.  Really, unless
you come across a genuine low mileage bus that has spent
most of its life garaged you have a rust problem....

You may not be able to see it yet but its there - its the
nature of the way rust works on them.  The inside of the
chassis sections (outriggers, center chassis sections, 
outriggers) were never painted.  Buses rot from the inside
out - its really just a question of whether its out yet...

When you find a 'rust-free' bus the crucial test would
be to wave a torch over these sections, or run a mig
 over them (set to an setting that would 'easily'
weld 0.6mm) and see what happens.  In my experience
(not as great as many certainly) you end up blowing
holes in most places.

Really, most buses (80% as a guess) need a similar
amount of rust repair.  Basically everything that hangs off
the two longitudinal chassis rails......its just that on some
its more obvious than others!

AND mechanically 'fixing'  buses is not 'saving' these buses
in respect to their long-term survival.  While certainly
praiseworthy and a long way better than doing nothing
its the bodies falling out from under them that will kill them...

donning suit, ducking now    8-)
