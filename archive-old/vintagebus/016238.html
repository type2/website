Hello list,
I am looking for information on a slide out spring loaded step that I have 
removed from a 63 deluxe.  Could a 67 Westy have come with such a step? Does 
anyone have info or pictures of this step they could share? The step is very 
rusty but can be repaired, I am just unsure how it should look and operate.  
As always thanks for any help.

Boyd Smith
67 Westy
