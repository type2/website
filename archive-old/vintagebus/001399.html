I bought a Stewart Warner South Wind heater with no model # but i was told
it was the kind that got mounted under the dash of cars in the 1940s.  It
sorta looks like the top of an old boat motor case and is painted with
hamermill gray paint any one know about mounting one of these in a splitty?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
