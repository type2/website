But did people goggle eye all around him and leave him no peace, or did
people respect his presence and let him do his thing?

A couple years back I was at the Porsche and VW lit show in L A and in comes
Jerry Seinfield, this was at the peak of his career, but nobody paid any
mind to him (except for a few, who were trying to pawn there s#_at_t off to
him). I respected his presence and didn't do a thing till he walked up to my
friends table, then I asked him to autograph the Terry Schuller book I just
bought, now I have it signed by Seinfield and Schuller. He was just there
checking stuff out, not really to buy, was just something to do, so he was
there for the same reason I was, seeing what's around and to socialize with
his peers.

Ronnie

&gt; &lt;&lt; I wonder how people figured out that it was Eddie in the first place?
I'd
&gt;  think that if he just dressed like a typical bus guy (however that is)
&gt;  he'd blend in just fine.  OTOH, if he had on his metal-rocker outfit and
&gt;  was trailed by an entourage he'd stick out like a sore thumb!
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I think it was  Katie that spotted Eddie first.  We were
sitting 
&gt; at Kyle's bus and she spotted Eddie through the last side window AND the
rear 
&gt; window of Lenny's super deluxe that was there.  Sure enough it was him.
We'd 
&gt; like to think she was the first to say &quot;dear god, that's Eddir Van Halen&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; As far as &quot;how'd anyone figure out it was him&quot; goes, come on George!  I
dont 
&gt; know how old you are, but from reading your posts about your dad comming
out 
&gt; to save you and your dying battery you cant be that old and I'm guessing
you 
&gt; arent a Van Halen Fan of any sort,

Well, my father is 89, so I am of the age (43) where Van Halen has meaning
for me and their music is enjoyable.  

 but , but....but....it was Eddie freaking 
&gt; Van Halen.  Whether some peope realize it or not, he's one of those people

&gt; that cant just walk down the street without attracting a crowd   At least
in 
&gt; my generation he is.

I suppose that our perceptions are different.  I enjoy the music, but I'm
not ready to be a groupie.  After all, he's a musician, not Ben Pon or
Ferry Porsche!

&gt; I bet if it came down to it, you'd recognize him too.......he wasnt hard
to 
&gt; spot...=)

By this, I think you mean that he was wearing his traditional garb and
therefore was easy to spot.  In that case, I'd probably know that he was
some sort of celeb, but wouldn't know who.

In my motorcycle and VW experience I've rubbed elbows with a number of
celebs.  Some of these experiences were great, others were not.  The
difference seemed to be whether the celeb was truly interested in the
subject or was simply there because it was trendy.

Steve McQueen, at the height of his fame was actively competing in
motorcycle races.  He didn't bring his entourage and generally entered
under an assumed name (&quot;Harvey Mushman,&quot; for one).  When he was at races
he was one of the racers, not a celebrity, and expected to be treated as
such.  He was so low profile that many of the other racers didn't even
know that they guy in the next pit was a Big Star (tm)

I guess that is the standard by which I measure celebrity behavior at VW
and other events.  If they're there to do the same thing that I am doing
then I respect their privacy and move on to more important things.

George
