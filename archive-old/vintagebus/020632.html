And I hate to keep the rain falling, but I made up bus list stickers of 
that design like 7 years ago (Back when it was still the Vanagon_at_Lenti 
list). I've got one on the back of my bus still. I 
don't think you can copyright the shape itself, or worry about every 
single letter combination. Seems like they've been doing those in Europe 
for longer than either of us. There are now a lot of counties and cities 
here in NC that are doing them as well. It's pretty trendy these days. 

&gt; &gt; Hate to rain on your parade, but Das Kool Bullis
&gt; already use's the country of origin kind of decal.
&gt; Which are trademarked and copywrighted. Check the back
&gt; of Dan Kinsey's binz in the new OBR. Or look it up on
&gt; Thom or Everetts sites.
