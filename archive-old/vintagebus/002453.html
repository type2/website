Hi!

Upon the dash of my daily driver:

1.   a slew of stones, each one painted with the name of a bus campout
(Thanks Snoopy!!!)
2.   a model splittie
3.   a stuffed ladybug
4.   a &quot;lucky&quot; stick
5.   a mini speaker for my CB radio
6.   a magnetic light (my panel lights are dead)
7.   a teeny tiny model of a superbeetle
8.   a miniature Twiddlebug

And of course, various other items as I am traveling. (Like drink bottles,
snack wrappers, maps, etc)

My other 2 buses are projects, and do not have the clutter that accumulates
from driving them. (Unless you want to count the 8Track player that resides
upon the dash of my 68)

&gt; Hey Volks
&gt;
&gt; All my driving buses seem to have a propensity to attract odds and ends to
&gt; gather on the dash by way of decoration. Since it's Friday here and we
&gt; haven't had a list
&gt; questionnaire for a while, here goes:
&gt;
&gt; What do you have decorating your dash?
&gt;
&gt; My 63 Dormobile has the following knicknacks collected on our travels:
&gt; * Several kinds of everlasting wild flowers stuck through the speaker
&gt; grille;
&gt; * Some &quot;flowers&quot; made from wire and old beverage cans;
&gt; * Some interesting feathers: guinea fowl, francolin, etc;
&gt; * A couple of porcupine quills;
&gt; * A couple of interesting stones;
&gt; * A Nelson Mandela inauguration R5 coin;
&gt; * A piece of sea-worn driftwood that looks like a snake;
&gt; * A micromachines split bus pulling a wheelie;
&gt; * Matchbox #34, &quot;VW Caravette&quot;;
&gt; * Modern radio/tape hacked into radio space (DPO!)
&gt;
&gt; The Zebra bus is basically more of the same, but with the addition of:
&gt; * Oil temp gauge
&gt; * Radio blanking plate!
&gt;
&gt; So what do you guys all have decorating/cluttering up your dash?
