Looks like I won't be able to make it this year - for the first time in
four years.

I have been the 67 red and white deluxe parked in front of the firehouse
for the last three Kelleys.

I thought it was on the first sunday of April and made important plans for
this weekend - didn't think of checking for easter occurrance.
