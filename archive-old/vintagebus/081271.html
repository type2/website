Subject: Re: [VB] slash bumpers

Actually - someone did respond directly - I decided against the repro 
stuff - the problem with my og overriders was that they are rusty inside and 
when they were painted and stuff before they kept rusting in the tubes and 
rust ran down onto the blades. I figure what I'll try is cleaning out the 
tubes with a wire brush - maybe rinse em with lacquer thinner then use the 
por-15 products - then por-15 inside with ... maybe just a rag on a 
coat-hanger or something.  I'll por all of the parts in the inside - then 
put em together - then prime and paint.

I mentioned some sort of rubber seal between where the parts meet - because 
I thought I say that somewhere - maybe the WW site - I dunno?

Thanks for responding.

&gt;
&gt; Can't believe no one has responded to this one... My experience with repro
&gt; overrider stuff with OG bumpers is that you end up fine tuning the fit
&gt; with a grinder. Do it before painting and rust-proofing. There are no
&gt; rubber trim pieces that I've ever seen between the overriders/pipes and
&gt; the bumper blade. Make sure everything fits right before POR-ing and
&gt; painting. Get your bolts, etc and put it all together. The parts should
&gt; not pull into and scrape the blade when the bolts are tightened, or else
&gt; they will scratch your paint and rust up.

&gt;&gt; Can anyone tell me if it is possible to use repro overrider stuff with OG
&gt;&gt; slash bumpers - and is there any sort of stuff that goes between the
&gt;&gt; overriders and the bumper - any sort of rubber seal or anything.
