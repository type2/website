John,

What ratios do you have in your flier?

Chris



&gt; I just put a freeway flier in my bus about a month ago and
I've had it
&gt; out on two road trips now. I really like the results. I
get 21 mpg now
&gt; instead of 18 and the engine runs about 20 degrees F
cooler.
&gt;
&gt; For the record, my engine is 1600 DP with a CW crank and
dual weber 34
&gt; ICT carbs. That might be a little more hp than a stock
1600 DP, but it
&gt; isn't much more. I normally drive at 70 mph an the
interstate except in
&gt; the summer when the oil temp gets too high. From what I've
seen so far,
&gt; I think I'll be doing 70 this summer too.
&gt;
