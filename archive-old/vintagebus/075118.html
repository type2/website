Subject: re:POR15 thoughts

 My understanding is that prep work is minimal-but folow the directions! you
need to degrease the surfaces-using their product is recommended(i think it
is called marine clean) then use their metal ready stuff-helps convert rust
to this white looking substance...then rinse, wait for it to dry
thoroughly(sometimes i use a heat gun gently, depending on the surface) then
por15 it. as for top coating, I have heard that nothing sticks to it but
their product tie-coat primer. unless you spray some primer on it while it
is still a little tacky(ie not completely cured). otherwise it supposed to
be extrememly difficult to rough up the surface and get any other paint to
adhere(it is quite glossy)
