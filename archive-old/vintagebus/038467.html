Hi,

I also have a 1967 bus with a sloppy front end. As for alignment there is
little to be done in the traditional sense. The toe-in is adjustable by
means of lengthening or shortening the tie-rods. Camber is adjusted by the
shims on the linkpins and requires removal of the linkpins, some careful
measurement and the replacement with new shims. DO NOT GO TO Sears and
expect them to want to do or understand how to do this. Castor is not
adjustable. 

To get the slop out of your front end I would suggest running through the
Muir Idiot Guide chapter on front ends. Despite what Muir says, your bus
came from the VW factory with king and link pins and he does a good job of
running you through some diagnostic procedures and explaing how the drag
link is connected to swing arm, and the swing arm is connected to the......(
you know the medoly:)

I was able to correct a great deal of the slop in my front end by getting
the link pins properly adjusted and tightening the clamp on the drag link
which seemed dangerously loose. The bummer is that my link pins went so
long(PO is a freind so I wont flame here) without proper adjustment and
grease that they wore and will need to be replaced. I will be doing this
soon so anyone with tips feel free to drop a line.

Another issue that may me and perhaps you is the steering box. If everything
is properly setup you steering wheel should look straight when the bus is
going forward. This is adjusted at the draglink. When the bus is heading
straight and the wheel is straight the steering gear sits in a tight spot
that helps keep steering feel firm and moving forward without wandering. My
steering wheel is at about 2 and 10 o'clock so I will set that straight
after all the other work is done.

Finally, if you dont have the Bentley, get it! It has invaluable info about
you bus and will help you understand how to do specific work on you front
end and the rest of your bus. I got one last year from BusDepot_dot_com for less
than $70 and have already gotten my money's worth!

Good look and let me know how it is going .
