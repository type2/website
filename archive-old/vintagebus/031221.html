Subject: [VB] Offering Buses FS on this list

I enjoy seeing the occasional bus listed here for sale, or reported here
as being listed for sale in another media.  However, I do have one
suggestion...

How about making sure you tell us where it is!!  B^)

I enjoy reading everyone's helpful messages here.  But I don't know any
of you personally, don't know where you live, and I don't memorize your
area codes.  So PLEASE don't make me guess where the bus is!  Now I am
not going to flame the members of any particular, bus-heavy North
American coastal region as being most culpable in this faux pas.  But
apparently some folks forget that we have bus lovers here from Australia
to the Great White North.

This happens a lot on the  RAMVA newsgroup, and guess what the first
reply is about?
