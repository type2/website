Subject: Painting in Cold Weather

Tom,

My painting skills are not great but i had an
interesting experience with painting in the cold last
spring.  (Even in California it gets cold sometimes)

My bus got chilled overnight and i painted it the next
morning.  The paint went on fine and looked great but
i am told that because the metal was so cold and i did
not have heaters to help it along my paint &quot;flashed&quot;
and turned out very dull.  No shine at all although
the paint is very smooth.  Really weird and very
depressing.

I have painted 4 other cars so i know a little bit and
do not think it was anything other then the cold.  I
also spoke with my paint supplier and he agreed.  We
even tested the extra paint and room temp and all was
fine.

anyway, that is what i have experienced.  Oh ya.  It
was PPG Acrylic Urethane.

Matt
