Subject: Re: [VB] Bus weight

James,

   From 2,359  lbs. for a standard to 2,535 for a deluxe. From a 1965 sales brochure found on www.thesamba_dot_com. That's a brand new bus. Add a few pounds for mud, caked on oil, grease, etc. Subtract a few pounds for the rusty parts that have fallen off. 
  Not sure of the engine weight. See www.type2_dot_com and search the archives. You'll find other good stuff there. 

 -Harry
