&lt;&lt; I was wondering if anyone new where I could find a 66 or 67 splash pan for 
a
 friends bus. I found one in a junk yard in vegas for my bus but I dont have
 any leads on finding another one. Does anyone have one they would like to
 part with.

I see a lot of messages about splash pans.  Were they installed on 71 busses? 
 Mine doesn't have one and I don't even know what one looks like.  I have 
never seen them advertised by the sheetmetal sellers.  That could be part of 
my heating problem.
