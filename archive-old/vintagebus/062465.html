Subject: RE: [VB] chicago area vw shops

While I will agree completely with your recommendation, I feel it's
prudent to point out the roughly 800 miles that separate them...

There is someone on the list that specializes in VW restoration work and
he's damn good. I know because, I've been to his shop. His name is Kelly
Brown and you can't see pictures of his work at www.metwiz_dot_com

&gt;     Does anyone have a lead on a vw shop in the area?  I've checked 
&gt; out several  body shops and &quot;supposed&quot; vw shops and they are confused 
&gt; as to what a 57 singlecab even looks like. I've heard more than 1 time

&gt; that vw did not make them, but what do you expect from a cut and weld 
&gt; insurance is our best customer shop!  I have everything ready to go 
&gt; for reassembly but just need someone with the body skills to put the 
&gt; pieces in the &quot;correct&quot; places so I can add the parts and get it on 
&gt; the road before winter.
