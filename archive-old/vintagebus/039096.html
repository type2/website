Hi Michael,

That was me that mentioned that method.  I have been using this method for fixing a friends harness that was quite butchered, but using a third piece of wire (after the original wire had become two pieces) to add the length that was butchered off.  I put the new piece of wire, which doesn't need to be the same color, just the same guage, in the middle where it will be covered.  So far it has worked great, although I give no warantees with this idea :)  It helps to know approximately how long the butchered wire is suppose to be when you add the new length, and if you are really anal you can take two butchered harnesses and make them into one perfect one and have the right wire color through and through.  Good luck.

Richard


I can't remember where or when, but I saw quite a cool idea for harnesses.
It appealed to me cos I'm cheap and I like the idea of original wiring that
I can reference to Thom's fab wiring diagrams. 

This guy pulls the harness and then cuts it in two in the middle. Then joins
all the 'old' ends which would theoretically leave the 'new' ends about the
right length. Just for the hell of it I tried it out on an old beach bike
that a mate had lying about and it worked pretty well.  

I spose that it would require a harness that hadn't been completely
butchered tho.

Later 

michael
