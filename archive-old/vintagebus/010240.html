Alternator Update!

    A couple of weeks back I ask the list about upgrading my generator to an
alternator. Well I have my new 75 Amp Bosch alternator in and boy did it
make a difference. This evening when I went down town the headlights were
much brighter than before and the difference is noticeable when I turn the
lights on before I start the bus its like putting on the high beams. The
unit was a bit pricey but I wanted to be able to put in a stereo and couple
other items with out killing the battery. This unit would work well for
charging an extra battery or for some of those camper items that need the
extra juice!  Anyway It is getting late and I thought I would share this
with all of you.
