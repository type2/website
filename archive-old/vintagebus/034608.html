&lt;&lt; The seals are all metal.  I've only ever seen the silicone ones that are

Hi Steve,
We use a hammer!  Use using the handle of it to push down on the inner 
portion of the inner bearing.  This in turn pushes the inner grease seal out 
without any damage to any either the seal or the bearing!  Making both 
reuseable.  Just make sure to lay down clean newpaper or cardboard to keep 
the bearing out of the dirt/sand/dust on the ground.
