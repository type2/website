Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Fuel tank cleanout (was never assume)

The world needs cautionary tales, whether they're from the Grimm 
brothers, &quot;don't go out in to a forest alone and break off candy from a 
house&quot;, or from our government, &quot;guard against terrorists by duct taping 
your house against gas attacks!!!&quot; Well maybe not that last example 
because somebody stupidly took our government's advice and did die.  
Given those extremes I'd venture that sparks, smokes, pilot lights, 
glitter body makup and flinty souls don't mix with gasoline encountered 
outside a vehicle's tank. Unless you have a far reaching urge to put out 
a cigarette butt in shimmering Shell, don't share your death wish with 
the common public. You might have to teach some high school dropouts how 
to run an oil refinerty and discuss the fine points of where you can 
toss a Camel butt, but 99.9999% of humans on this planet should KNOW for 
whatever reasons that gasoline and other flammables are nothing to 
trifile when they're not in their 'natural' surroundings.

Bus content? I'm slowly bringing a '79 Westy back to life. My effort 
this week was to worry about a battery, await delivery of suitable tires 
from Pennsylvannia and actually spray wasp nests in the luggage rack.All 
four holes. Oh, and I watched Karl find a #3 cylinder web crack in his 
daily driver at 9 a.m./85 degrees and help dig out a single port block 
he was keeping for some reason.

 -Harry in Fresno (wondering how immortal will these tappings be?)

&gt;&gt;,,,When he went into his garage the next morning, he noticed a pool
&gt;&gt;of gas on the floor (wide pool of gas means lots of surface area for
&gt;&gt;evaporation).  Deciding that he needed to clear out the gas fumes, he
&gt;&gt;reached for the electric door opener.
