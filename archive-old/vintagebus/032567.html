if you read the text in the wilson book, my copy pp. 134, he sez:
&quot;the previous sequence is for all type1-3 engines with 10mm studs, and all
type 4s.  type 1-3 engines from 73-on with 8mm studs should be final
torqued to only 18ft.-lbs [again with that stupid measurement--jon] (2.5
kg-m). overturquing these engines will only result in stretched studs. 
engines with 10mm studs and case savers can be safely final torqued to
[huh???-jon] 28ft.lbs (3.8 kg-m).&quot;  
kinda what i had said in a previous post, but i was wondering which book
you were refering to, then i checked my stack and found the wilson book and
checked.  that book is pretty good, but i don't like his use of sealants
and some info is a little contrary to vw's recommendations. (please don't
jump me for being anti-some-sealants, and don't ask which info, check/learn
for yourself).
hope this helps

&gt; From the Tom Wilson book he just says 23 ft/lbs for the head stud nuts and
&gt; of course the corresponding tightening pattern.
