Ellie and I are going to make it.
We'll be rollin' in a sea blue and white 67 hdt dlx.
Well be at KP too. Do you think the powers that be
will let us tow a small tent trailer into KP? I saw a bug with
a trailer a couple of years ago, but never bus.

Now the question part. Are the vent wing latches on 
our above mentioned bus supposed to have black latches
or chrome. It has a black shift knob and black dash knobs so
I'm not sure if the chrome ones are correct. The driver side latch
is busted so when I fix it, I might as well use the right part.
Thanks for any input.
Larry
