&lt;&lt;  While I'm sure that I replace the fuel tap in the correct
 position, it now only works in the reserve position. When I put it in the
 normal position it cuts the gas supply. Running permanently on reserve is
 going to lead to problems so any advice would be appreciated. &gt;&gt;
Hi Glen,
First if you have installed the switch backwards then to make it run in
reserve you would have to have the knob pushed as you would for normal
non-reserve running.
If you had the valve out and did not rebuild/clean it.  Then it is very
possible that it has clogged up from fuel varnish.  Same thing happened to my
dad in his 1957 Non-sunroof delux due to not using the reserve on occasion.
Because of this we like to run the fuel through the reserve for at least a
couple of minutes every couple of months or so in our 1960.   Eric&amp;Barb
