Andy writ:
&gt;Ive only had 2 of them, both old, never a new one. &lt;

I think someone must have done the dirty work for you already then :)

The older ones I have seen are definitely better castings, but still need a
little cleaning up work.  The new ones are definitely worse though.

After grinding and polishing mine it is very nice looking though...  Bench
grinder/buffers make life soooo easy sometimes :)  A great $40 investment
from Home Depot.
