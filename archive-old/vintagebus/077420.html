Subject: Re: [VB] backing plate adhesive?

sometimes I use the brownish stuff that comes in a tube with a brush on the lid that I use for engine cases, or silicon sealant, or whatever is handy at the time.  

Hey you might as well pull your link pins out and clean them up, take a gander at that stuff as you are just about there.

undo the pinch bolts for the link pins.. you know where those are  right cause the links get checked every 3K miles right... its the 17mm nut and bolt on the inside of the spindle asembly... in teh Muir book and Bentley, and then I think you can tap the links out and investigate the rollers bearings.  I got crazy when I did this and painted my spindles.   they still look nice.

&gt; I am in the midst of trying to put the stock front drums brakes back together on my 65 bus. I took the brakes apart right back to the backing plates. Now that I am in the process of putting them back together I read in the VW manaul that the backing plates should have adhesive on the to seal them to the knuckles/kingpins (whatever is back there can't recall the order).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway.. what should I use for adhesive, the manaul mentions some VW part that I am sure has been out of production for 
&gt; longer than I have been on the planet.
