Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin

40hp tin was the same for beetle or bus, actually .   Does it fit funny? 
Where?  I once took a 40hp fresh air motor out of a 63 bug and popped it in a 
bus, worked fine. the pieces under the engine between case and heater box are 
supposed to be pretty important for cooling the engine.  

wait- what kind of motor do you have?  stale air 40hp? what did 61 bugs use?  
did they still get 36hp?

&lt;&lt; Does anyone know of a web page with pics of type 2 engine tin vs type 1 
engine
 tin?
 
 My bus is a 60 and the engine is from a 61 beetle.  I suspect that the engine
 tin is right for a beetle but not right for a bus - but I do seem to run
 pretty cool.
 
 I don't have pieces of tin that run from the bottom of the heater boxes to 
the
 engine.  I do have pieces the go right under the cylinders.
 
 TIA &gt;&gt;
