I think you guys miss the point.

Imagine someone gives you a 13mm wrench.  You're working happily on
your VW, wrenching away, until you need to do a repair that you need
a pair of pliers.  Do you instantly post to the list that 13mm
wrenches are evil and are no good?  No!  You go find a pair of pliers!

I don't find Hoover, Clara, Muir, Berg, et-al, or anyone reference to be
the be-all-end-all source.  I think each of them is full of it in some
regards, and each has a lot to contribute.  You need to have a drawer
full of tools; some you buy at sears, some you build yourself when the
time comes and you need it.  All these guys, the whole list, are just
tools for you to use.

All of these guys and grrrl gained their knowledge the hard way, with 
lots of busted knuckles, and you have to respect that.  Because they don't 
tell you what you want to hear doesn't invalidate their advice in any 
way, any more than them telling you what you want to hear would suddenly 
make it gospel.  

None of these people are making any money off of helping you, and
free advice is worth every penny.

When faced with a problem, you need to research more than one path
to resolution, and settling on the one you feel most comfortable with.
