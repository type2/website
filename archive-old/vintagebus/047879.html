Subject: tent/awning without holes in bus?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

After hanging out in my friends tent over the Classic weekend and becoming 
re-born in the amazing thing called shade, I would like to have some. Is 
there any type of tent or more or less awning that does not require holes or 
brackets in the roof of my bus? I am willing to drill the small holes in my 
bumper. Just curious.
     Mike
