    Personally I believe that supply and demand and need or want will settle
this matter.  If Todd sells his bus it is because of the supply and demand.
If someone wants that bus(I know I do but the demand would go to Citibank
and they demand hard(14+%)) and they are willing to pay and Todd doesn't
really need the money then the price is what it is.
    Now if Todd needs to sell the bus (Citibank?) and someone comes by and
makes a realistic offer then as the saying goes(&quot;Cash on the Barrel&quot;) Todd
would miss his bus but he would have the cash!?  I don't think that Todd
really wants to sell his bus and I know that he really doesn't want to sell
his safaris but if the demand, on either buyer or seller side) justifies
buying/selling the bus then there it goes.
    Todd don't sell the bus just yet.  I keep hearing the voices to spend
the rent on lottery tickets cause they told me I would win.
Would you take a IOU till I win the lottery if you don't need the money
