&gt; Hi eric and barb,
&gt; 
&gt; I would strongly disagree with the word definitely. I would say 4 bearings
&gt; per side were a necessity due to lowering the gearing.  Once you have 2
&gt; gears there, they have to be supported both ends to mesh properly unless
&gt; the shafts are fixed and stiff, which they are not in this case.

You also have to consider the side loads on the tire.  the RGB bearings
are at a distinct disadvantage here since they are spaced only a few
inches apart, as opposed to the swingaxle bug' lever arm of more than a
foot from the spade end to the bearing.

However, the RGB bearings were obviously designed by very smart engineers
who probably stressed them to carry a bus.  The Beetle axles were designed
by similar engineers who designed them to carry a bug.  They never
intended it to carry a bus, and knowing the tendency of German engineers
to design things to be _just_ strong enough I think that putting the
weight of a bus on a bug swingaxle is asking for problems.
