Subject: AAAAAAHHHHH was Starter Frustration

Hi Volks,
Thanks for all the replies.  I struggled with the engine mount bolt some

more.  I could not get a 17 mm on it or  vise grips and was about to run

out of all patience ( it's the end of the school year and I'm pretty
drained!) I just could not get any of the for mentioned to work.  Maybe
cause it's my short reach of my massive 5' 6&quot; body ;0) But I finally
took a 2&quot; long flat head screw driver and wedged it between the head and

the tranny.  Thanks again for all who offered their advice.  Hopefully
I'll get it running soon!
