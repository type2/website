&gt;  Curious about the date of your westy
&gt;  &gt; parts list, JP.  
&gt;  
&gt;  Can't find the original, my web site is down, and I
&gt;  can't find the scans of that manual, but I'll let you
&gt;  know the date if I can locate it.  I'd guess that it
&gt;  was at the start of SO-42 production, hence the
&gt;  clamshells.

Could you let me know when the website is working again.  I like looking at 
parts lists.
