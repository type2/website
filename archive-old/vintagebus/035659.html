&lt;&lt; Ok everyone,
 I have a '59 panel and all of the wiring harness is brand new... 
 My prob is that the front bullet turn signal doesn't work and the bulb isn't 
 burnt out. I can hear the flasher clicking for the rear and the speedo light 
 doesn't come on when i put the switch to the left because of this problem... 
 
 Where should I start? Bad ground? bulb holder? everything past the flasher?
 
 Probably really simple...I'm a wiring novice:)
  &gt;&gt;

I would start out by seeing how far you have power.  get out your test light- 
do you have power to the blub holder- ground the light, turn the signal on, 
and hold the other end to the wire to the bulb holder.  If it blinks, it is 
downstream of there,  so check your grounds, take the bulb out and test for 
blink at the bulb holder wher ethe bulb makes connections, etc.   

 if it doesnt blink (and you check you make sure the light works) it is 
upstream of there, so get a wiring diagram and follow it upstream.
