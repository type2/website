Subject: re:type 4 conversion

i have a 1.7 T4 engine, i have been kicking around the idea of sticking it 
in my bus, but i have heard that the 1.7 isn't worth the waste of time.

i've never rebuilt one so i can't form my own personal opinion unless i 
decide to give a go and fail, or succeed.

i believe it will run for at least a little while, if all i do is replace 
all the seals and convert it to upright. although i have been thinking 
about sticking it in there to see how it fits.

i've heard that it would cost the same to rebuild the 1.7 as it would to 
basically build a larger [than 1600] type 1/2 engine, any thoughts, 
experiences with this?

i'm hoping to be in a position to start building or purchase an engine 
next summer, if all my welding and upholstery projects slated for winter 
go smoothly. so i need to make an absolute decision on this 1.7 engine. 
consequently i'm very interested in the type 4 discussion.

my bus has a ghia tranny in it [per PO], will the type 4 bolt up, or would 
i need to use another?

on another subject, has anyone had to replace the heater tube that carries 
warm air to the front of your bus? mine was cut out to make room for a 
belly mounted radiator and fan {whatever} (i pulled about 12 feet of 
radiator hose out of the various cavities of my bus)

thanks for listening,
