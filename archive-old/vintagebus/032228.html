Subject: brazil muffler problems on my 1600DP...
Mime-Version: 1.0

I bought a stock replacement muffler for my rebuild 1600DP (used to have 
an extractor exaust) about half a  year ago. It is made by Kradon, 
Brazil P/N 211 251 051EB.
Now that I finally get around to finishing this motor I find that the ends
that 
are supposed to slide on to the heaterboxes are *barely* long enough to
meet the 
pipe coming out of the heaterboxes, barely. They are about 1 inch long and
it seems that
they are should to be longer then that?  Am I missing something?
Wrong muffler? Is the brazilan no good and should I buy german?
