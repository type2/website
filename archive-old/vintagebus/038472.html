Hi, everybody!

EveryBus 2000, the second anual event will take place April 14th, 15th and
16th at Hagan Stone Park which is located 8 miles south of Greensboro, NC.
Last years event brought 60 buses from as far away as Canada, St. Louis,
Boston, Atlanta and points in between. All buses are welcome. Last year we
had buses form 1959 to 1989 camping along side each other and it was truly a
site to behold! We will be camping in a reserved camping loop that offers a
picnic table, electrical and water hookups at each site. The infield area of
the loop is open and provides addtional camping space for those who want to
rough it. The infield also offers a picnic shelter with tables and fireplace
as well as a seperate area for a bonfire.

Hagan Stone park is a 400 acre wildlife and nature refuge and is absolutely
beautiful in the Springtime! There are walking and hiking trails, several
playgrounds for kids( one of whick is right in our reserved camping area,
and some nice places to bike. There are also some tent camping sites
available if you would prefer to be in a more secluded area. Each tent site
site offers a picnic table, tent pad and fire pit. These are not resered by
EveryBus but there are at least 40 of them so if you get there Friday you
should be in good shape to get a nice one.

EveryBus begins Friday morning( I was surprised to find poeple already there
when I arrived last year:) The theme for Friday is relax and get to know
your bus neighbors! Friday night bring your acoustic instruments and
something musical will make itself happen under the picnic shelter.

For Saturday morning we are thinking of having one of those Boy Scout
Pancake breakfasts for $4.00 a head. What do think? I need to get some
feedback( no pun intended ) to the Scouts about how many might really eat so
they can decide it will work for them. Saturday afternoon there will be a
fieldtrip to see the METWIZ and his bus metal headquarters which is located
about 15 miles from the campground. If you have not seen Kelly's work now is
the chance. Currently in the shop are 1956 Sunroof Standard, 1956 23 win,
1957 23 win, 1958 HD deluxe, 1963 Sundial, and my bus just left there with
lotsa new metal including a Beta test set of the new METWIZ jack points
whcih you can see at the campout.

Saturday night at about 8: OO we will draw for doorprizes. Last year we had
a good haul and hope to get some more good donations. If you would like to
donate a doorprize please let me know buy email. Vendors are welcome to
donate parts and they will be recognized at the drawing and on he website.
Please dont forget the kids! We had lotsa kids last year and had some
generous doorprizes of bus toys that put lotsa smiles on childrens faces.
After the drawing there will be more music and socializing!

Sunday morning will be time to get up early for the IVWA show, swap, and
races at Farmington. We will do our best to arrange a caravan of sorts to
leave a little earlier this year. Farmington is about 50 minutes from the
campground but worth the drive if you are looking for parts, wanna see even
more buses, or like Type1 drags.

Please visit the website for EveryBus and you will find pics and stories
from last year, more speil, and directions.
