Birch:
Baltic might not be correct but was as close as I
could find back when I was doing the &quot;resto from
hell&quot;. Maybe I talked up the birch thing too much.
That is what I was told it was. Worked for me. Also
have used the same materials &lt;plural&gt; in a previously
owned '83 Westy and the '63 EZ camper.
&quot;Materials plural&quot; meaning the 60&quot;x 60&quot; sheets of two
sided stuff, which is closer to the original and the
cheezier 4' x 8' luan sheets from Home Depot etc.
Agree that the luan is more red. My choice on both was
to apply a light coat of Golden Oak stain and then put
full gloss clear over it. Both choices are probably
wrong as hell but please me. My guess is that the oem
stuff was closer to the 5x5 sheets with natural and a
satin over top. Keep in mind that full gloss is more
proned to finger prints etc. The yellowing that I saw
on the replaced panels of the 65-67 campers that I
stripped possibly was the result of sun baking the old
formula varnish. Pure guess on my part...
A Southern Cal source that I have had good luck with
and have found to be very reasonably priced is
Peterman Lumber 15492 Slover, Fontana,CA 92335
(909)357-7730. Citrus South exit off of whatever fwy-
I forgot to note it- but a local CA resident can
figure it out very easily. I last paid $7.84 per sheet
vs. a local Phoenix &quot;Woodworkers Source&quot; which has the
exact same sheist for $20++ per sheet! (July, 98 for
both prices)

Blue prints: 
Nice concept for a starting point but I have always
had to pretty much hand craft the panels to the
vehicle being worked for a nice finished fit. I *DONT*
claim to be anything more than a hack wood worker but
find each bus ever so slightly different. Expect
having to fine tune the measurments. I personally
can't visualize a casual hack amatuer (self?)
correctly translating compound radial arc curves from
prints to scale and making it all come out right. 1:1
scale templates are fun enough for my skills, tools
and crappy working environment.
One bus that is going to have a drop dead *GORGEOUS*
wood interior is located in the PNW and should make
it's debut hopefully in the near future. We're talkin'
building a Baldwin/lutier/shipright kinda stuff. Have
seen in progress photos.
