Subject: Question about T4 bus tranny ratios
Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2000 20:36:44 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

For future reference, I would like to file away some info concerning the
gear ratios on type 4 bus trannies.

In the future, I want to experiment with a 2L type 4 engine in a bug and I
have a pretty good idea on how to do this.  My only concern is that I don't
want to be stuck at 65mph top speed like my old 71 Westy was.

Ultimately, I like the 4.12 ratio on my brother's 72 Super beetle and find
that it is suitable for quick scooting around town with a t1 engine and it
also will blow the doors off my steeper geared 74 Super with the 3.88
gearing.

Did ANY T4 bus trannies come with the 4.12 R/P or more accurately, did ANY
T4 tranny come with gearing that is close to the T1 4.12 gearing?  I know
this is deep techinal stuff but I sure would like to know.  Thanks!
