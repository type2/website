Subject: Clutch Cable Question

OK this is going to be the 3rd time I've adjusted the clutch cable.  Seems 
like it loosens up after a couple of months of driving and shifting to R, 1 
and 2 gets difficult.  I end up crawling under to tighten the cable and it 
eases up shifting.  Also I've been driving a year now on my new tranny, 
should I change the gear oil?  Got a couple of other small problems I am 
working on now too.  I was closing my cargo door and twisted the handle 
right off, heard that was common.  Also my oil sender started leaking around 
the crimp in the middle, need to replace that too.  Other than this my bus 
has been running strong.  Have been driving it about 60-100 miles daily.  
Now I need to do some long weekend hauls.  I am building up to do a drive to 
OK in late July, planning on staying off the freeway even though I can do 
70+ now.
