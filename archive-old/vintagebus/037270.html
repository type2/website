&lt;&lt; about spacing, on yourpage where you show what the mtag should look like, 
to
 review , it puts the space between the model number and the 4th number on
 that line, in my case it says
 UP251 2121872
 where it should be
 UP2512 121872
........................

why dont you try UP 2512 121872,  that is how they arrange the digits on the 
Mcode tags I have seen for 65 and later
 ---------------------------------
 also by your translation  the top should be blue and the bottom white,
 claralw_at_aol_dot_com says the same, but the top is white and the bottom
 blue,whats up with that?
-  --  - -- - - -  -
oops, typo, I should have writ white on top, blue on bottom.
 ....................
 also the birthday is march 7 of 65 or 66??
 --------------------------------
well, seeing as yours is a '66 model, what do you think?
