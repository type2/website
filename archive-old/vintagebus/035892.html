Well I guess that I am lucky, cos one of the Phillips screws on the new/old
engine hatch was all rounded and I could not take it off , so I have a T-
handle but no locking mechanism. Anyway everyone is much better except that, I
now realise that the rear body part that the hatch latches to, has been pushed
in a few millimetres, I was going to try to straighten this but Clara says
just add a few washers to where it bolts to the body and it will be fine!!!!!
