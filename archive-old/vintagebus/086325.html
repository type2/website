Subject: fixing a door with bad lower hinge

 I have an original paint 64 bus , 
 
but the drivers door is messed up. 
 
the lower hinge was stuck , and the previous owner forced it open , 
 
so now the hinge is torn away from the door, OUCH !
 
I  can loosen up the hinge so that it will work , 
but how do I attach it back to the door ?
 
can I drill out the old rivets , make a backing plate for the door and bolt it back together ?
 
any ideas appreciated !
 
thanks  Dave
 
PS.....yes I know I could get another door , but I would like to save what I got and the OG paint
