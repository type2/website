Is this Gary Lavere's?  I have pix somewhere on my page, although
they'r enot very clear.  I checked it out when I was down picking up 
my bus.  

Basically what somoene needs to do is take a double-door and move the
stuff from the current lunchwagen to a less-rusty home.   He had a 
DD to go with it for the transplant.  I was tempted, but I have a large
enough project as it is...
