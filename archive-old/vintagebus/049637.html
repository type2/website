Subject: Hanging a bus?

My neighbor has a 30 foot high rolling crane. And a 3 ton hoist. I have a
singlecab with rust on the belly and major work needing to be done on the
underframe. And since I DON'T have the 3K for a rotisserie, I wanted to
know what the groupthink was on the idea of somehow using the hoist to
elevate at least one SIDE of the pickup, giving me stand-up access to the
undersides.
I am thinking mebbee bolting  sturdy bars to both front and back bumper
mounts, and lifting using those.
Should I remove the tranny?
Will I snap an already-wiggly bus? Should I just dig a trench to stand in,
A lA Scott of the Antactic (obscure Python joke)?
