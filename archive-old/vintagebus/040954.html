Subject: Need used 1600dp engine

Well, the engine in my '68 crew cab finally bit the big one.  This truck is
a bonafide bondo-mobile, and arguably not worth putting a new or rebuilt
engine into, as I.suspect it would far outlast the body. :-(   Before I bite
the bullet (or the bondo, as the case may be), would anyone happen to have a
good used 1600 dual-port engine they could sell me in the Philly area (and
preferably even deliver for a few extra $$)?
