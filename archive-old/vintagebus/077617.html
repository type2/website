Subject: Re: [VB] re:fuel shut off valve

Hi Kevin,
You really should just consider the stock VW fuel shut off.  It mounts in the 
outlet of the fuel tank, so when replacing flex fuel line there is &quot;0&quot; inches 
of fuel line before the valve to replace!  Also if you take a look at the 
front seat there still is the bump under the seat for installing a reserve fuel 
switch cable.  If you do not want to install the cable the reserve switch can 
be still used and switched by hand under the bus.
