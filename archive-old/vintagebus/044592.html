Brad
I had a the same kind off problem with my 66 bus (pic 1 carb i think) turned
out to be a bad accelerator pump rebuilt it and it still ran like crap. I
wound out buying a new carb (pic 3) bolted it on no more problems. The
price's are all over the place from 85.00 to 150.00, if you go this route
shop around. As far as getting the carb off its easyer than it looks. Just be
carefull not to lose anything like the little barrel nut that holds the
throttle cable :&gt;). (Not that i ever have).
ps A proper rebulid is possible and really not that hard it's the getting the
carb super clean without the proper gear, thats the hard part.
