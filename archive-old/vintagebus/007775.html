I'm thoroughly sickened to hear this and it's bothered me all day at work.
She could have eventually been a list member or we could have bumped into
her at shows.  It's really a shame. I sure hope that someone didn't take
advantage of her plight via the list or the AIRS site.  I have a hunch this
is just the random work of some crazed Interstate sicko.  I don't mean to
start any flames but this is the reason when I road trip, I carry a pistol
on me.  It may not save me in a host of circumstances but it's nice to know
that should someone try to take advantage of me, I can at least have a
little chance of putting the odds in my favour - even if statistics prove
otherwise.

My condolences to the family as well.  Charlie - where do we send our
donations?
