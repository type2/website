Subject: Re: [VB] Transport companies

well, it's not the driver's fault you know..... I would tip him anyway.... but it will all depend on
the overall experience with the guy plus on the condition of the Bus when it arrives. I don't want
to see any scratches not to mention dents....

how much should I tip him?
