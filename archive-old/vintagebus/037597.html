&lt;&lt; As I have had the tool identification problem before I wonder if anyone 
owns or has ever seen a VW special tool list? I don't mean the other 
aftermarket tools, but the VW distributed ones from mostly MATRA, Peiseler, 
Hunger and such.
 Any help is appreaciated. &gt;&gt;
Hi Martin,
We have one of those catologs of VW tools.  Plus a fellow we know had one we 
wanted to compare to ours to see if he had anty pages we were missing.
