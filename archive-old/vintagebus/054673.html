Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight color

When this subject came up earlier in the year, there was a reply that
West Coast Classics commonly uses Krylon #1403 'Dull Aluminum' for
restoring headlight buckets, implying that it was indistinguishable from
VW's original color.  I hope I am remembering this correctly.  I could
have sworn that it was on this mailing list but I can't seem to locate
the message to verify.

Anyway, at the time I wrote it down as I need to re-do my buckets some
day, and it took me a long time to find a can of the stuff.  It appears
that the Rustoleum people have paid off most of the home improvement
stores and chain FLAPS in my area to dump most of their Krylon
products.  Not that I believe in conspiracies, mind you.

&gt; I've checked the archives and found that the bucket color is either a silver
&gt; or gray, but found no specific paint numbers or names.  Is there any that I
&gt; might have missed?
