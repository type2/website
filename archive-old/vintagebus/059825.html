I'm trying to track down codes for Mango Green and Seagull Grey.  I do =
not need the L346 and L347 things but the formulas to mix that paint. I =
would also like some advice on the best type of paint to use. I am a =
complete novice painter and I think I'll try and do most of the prep =
work for my bus out side and either rent a spray booth or build one for =
actual painting. I was planning on using R-M paint but when I went to =
pick up the paint and epoxy primer and the high build primer the colour =
was way way off.  I want to use epoxy primer so what ever type of paint =
I use in the engine bay should work well with it. I had hoped to paint =
the engine bay and the interior of my bus this weekend - damn.

TIA
