Subject: front wheel bearing questions

little grinding on the front passenger wheel whenever i braked in my bus.=
 I
took the wheel off, and the hub and found some metal shavings around the
bearings-so i replaced both of them and the seal. The new seal I got is v=
ery
different from the one that was in there. The old one was basically squar=
e in
cross section, and the new one is U-shaped and has what looks like a spri=
ng on
it. it is also some type of plastic. It looks a lot like the front engine=

seal. I installed it with the bottom of the U shape out-is that correct. =
Also
the nuts did not have a lock washer on them, nor did they appear to have =
the
correct washer that goes against the bearings(the one with a notch sticki=
ng
out to prevent it from rotating. so i replaced these as well. just checki=
ng to
see if i did this correct-anyone else run into this?

oil change-and today i am taking a little trip to &quot;the end of the earth&quot; =
or
that is what it is called.....
