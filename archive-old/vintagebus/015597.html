Yeah, I always seem to be dismembering a bus in one way or another,
then I pretty them all up, and the next thing you know, I'm afraid to
drive it.   In addition, I'm kind of a workaholic: I think in terms
of &quot;if I take 2 weeks off, that's $x less that I'll make, which equates
to a set of safaris and a front seat cover.  Hmm.  So I better not
take any time of...&quot;

&gt; Thom....rumor has it that you don't drive your Busses much...let alone go
&gt; out on any serious road trips...why would you even wonder how folks do
&gt; trips?????  don't tell me you're actually thinking of driving one across
&gt; the state or something!!!!!!!
&gt; Being prepared...having some essential skills....some money...and time
&gt; off.  That's all I've ever needed.  And I'm outta here!
