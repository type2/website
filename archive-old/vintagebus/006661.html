Well Thom it looks like I have a project like you, My barndoor arrived today
and it needs some serious rust repair, not as bad as some peoples but enough
to take some time. Front floors, cargo floors, seat base, both rockers, left
door bottom and dogleg, most of the pieces are there, coat hooks, grab
handles, jailbars, latchs, door handles, dash pod, VW emblem,  wipers and
assorted other goodies, including all the glass and the rear seat, not for
the faint of heart but not to far gone to save, as the frame itself is still
very solid as is the center belly pan, will asess the rest of this diamond
in the ruff and figure out where i'm going to go with it. Have a load of
pics and will post these as soon as I fiquare out how.
