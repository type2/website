&lt;&lt; Hi List
 
 The needle bearings in my 66 front beam are broken/worn out.
 I have been trying to get new at my bearing dealer with no luck.
 Does anyone have a set of NOS ones or a source for new ones??
  &gt;&gt;
I got a set from Wolfgang, new, not NOS, the set bearing and new linkpins I 
believe, (for both sides) cost $100.
