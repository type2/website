Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

I bought some of those a year or so ago off of ebay, can't tell
if it's the same seller, but they are *CRAP*!  Actually, you'd
have to clean them up a bit for them to be crap.  And it says
&quot;made in Brasil&quot; (but in Portuguese) right on them (which of
course, isn't shown in the picture).   They literally feel like
they're made of bias-ply tires cut down and flattened out.  I
trimmed the tops and put them on my trailer, and found they
actually have *cords* in them like a tire!  They're fine for
the trailer, but I wouldn't put them on a car.

&gt; I just thought I would warn you about buying Mudflaps on ebay. There is a seller who is claiming to have NOS German Mudflaps for sale but they are Not German. I won one of his auctions but fortunately he never completed the transaction. I have been in contact with the other buyer and he told me they are brazillian and are complete garbage. The seller appears to be a &quot;major&quot; supplier of VW parts as well, though they had some setbacks within the last few years. Here is the link:
