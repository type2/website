ooh, that bites!!!  AAA does come in handy.   Hope you are sleeping now, and 
it'll work out.  At least you weren't 300 miles away.

 3:00am.   Just got dropped off by the tow guy....
 
 I tried to caravan with Rachel H. down to Lake Havasu and BBB V.
 
 Everything was a go and we made it to our first Gas stop in Gustine.
 
 But that's as far as I got.
 
 Whilst looking at a map to plot our course, we were sitting there at idle.
 
 Then, out of the blue...clackity clackity....
 
 &quot;Thats coming from my bus!&quot; I said over the roar of 18 wheelers passing by.
 
 Off goes the motor, and it never comes back.
 
 I send Rachel off to contiue the journey and I call AAA....
 
 Based of my observation, The intake valve on #4 has broken and is now wedged
 in the head.
