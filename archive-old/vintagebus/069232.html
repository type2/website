&gt; Now your up with the big boys! While yer up there, get the 46mm 3/4&quot; drive

&gt; life. Just don't drop that socket on yer foot!

I hear that.  These are big honkers.  I have a 46mm beater tool, but next
time I'm feeling flush I may take that advice.  Though even with my air
impact wrench, it took me some time to free up one of the axle nuts on my
Be*tle project recently.  Just did not want to let go.  Driver side big
nut on this bus was also stubborn; the pass side one came off with about
normal effort but the driver side one twisted my 1/2&quot; flex handle (though
with the beater and Sistah Sledge it yielded easily enough).  One thing I
don't like about the beaters is the drive hole tends to deform pretty
easily at those torques. 

But wow, to have a 46mm socket &lt;stars in eyes&gt;.

BTW Sears replaced my flex handle no prob.  In fact they were out of any
the length of my old one and the guy let me trade up for a longer one
free.  Also replaced my big screwdriver, which looked like someone had
been pounding side gears out with it or something [rolls eyes and
whistles].
