Subject: The Wandering Fu's.......The journey continues....

Howdy bus folks...

For anyone that is interested or are friends with the infamous Ricky Fu 
family.....here is an update.  I just got off the phone with him and here's 
where they are...

Currently in Texas, heading down the I-10 towards Houston.  Planning on 
heading out N'awlins  way, but not really interested in Mardi Gras due to 
their schedule.
I told him to check out the Mardi Gras celebration on the MS Gulf Coast this 
weekend and they may just do that.

Their plans are to head up the I-55 on make their way to some family in Ohio.

So far they have done the Carlsbad Caverns in NM and hit San Angelo to 
possibly meet up with Rex R., Austin, and I made him make a stop for me in 
Luckenbach, TX =)...hell, if I can't go home, then at least I can go in 
spirit...hehe

After a stay in Ohio, they plan on making their way back towards Cali.

If anyone in the dirty South wants to try and hook up with them, then p-mail 
me for contact info.  They are a great family to meet and have to be some of 
the nicest people I have ever met.

BTW, Ronnie....Ricky said the bus is running like a top....

Later,

Beto
