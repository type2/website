Subject: RE: [VB] Safari's in a Westy

Nope they will not woek with a childs cot or the childs cot will not work
with safaris. I did the dealer style install with my OG safaris, so I have
to unscrew one of the brackets to put the forward pole of the childs cot in,
no sweat, just an extra 5 minutes. Never did try to close the windows to see
if they clear though!

Subject: [VB] Safari's in a Westy


Planning on installing a set of safari's in my 67 westy. Was wondering if
the child's cot can still be used if the safari's are closed? Will the
safari's mounting brackets and sliders be in the way of the cots front
pole?Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance...
