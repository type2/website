Indeed.  Unfortunately, the wood will sometimes absorb the acid, which
can make for an entertaining time if you put your hand down and lean
against it to, say, reach the back of the cabinet....

Perhaps with a drain tube that goes down below the deck and points
back, so if there *is* significant spillage, it won't eat the vehicle?
Of course, there is an argument that says that dumping it out on the
road's not a whole lot better....

Ideally, you'd have a setup similar to how waterbeds are done - they
have a plastic liner that is capable of containing the entire volume
of water within the mattress.  Thus, when the mattress bursts, you
just have to deal with flashbacks to early childhood, rather than
trying to remember how to body surf a tsunami.
