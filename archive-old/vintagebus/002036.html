OK.  Enough B.S.ing about this thing.  Dave Easterwood who stated quite
clearly that he has no interest in this venture has offered to make the Bus
Tour baton (aka hubcap and hopefully the accompanying box as well) available
in the Atlanta, GA area (N.W. I think) on Friday morning.  Is there ANYBODY
out there who can and WILL pick up the baton in the interest of getting it
moving west, northwest, or southwest again???  Even if you can't move it out
of the Atlanta area immediately, if you can at least hold it until we can
find someone who can you will have done your part in making the Great Bus
Tour a success.

So how about it?  Alabama?  Tennessee?  N.W Georgia?  Maybe even Kentucky or
Mississippi for you long-distance drivers?  There's gotta be SOMEONE out
there just itching for a reason to be on the road in their bus!  And maybe
Mr. Easterwood would even be able to leave the baton on his porch or
somewhere accessible if you can't make it until the weekend?

Please don't flood the lists with this - the list-gods have been wonderfully
tolerant of this recent subject already.  While I don't have the time or
web-page knowledge to take over where Leo Soderman left off, I hope to at
least get it moving along again until we can find someone with the time and
the knowledge to bring it all back up to speed(Chris??).  So if ANYBODY can
go pick up the baton on Friday or at least this weekend, respond to me and
I'll do my best to get everyone hooked up and post the progress back to the
list.

If we can't make firm arrangements to get the baton picked up from Dave then
he is going to take it to the big bus show in NC on Friday.  If this
happens, whoever ends up with it PLEASE PLEASE let me know so we can get a
route figured out for it.  If it spend the next 2 months backtracking up the
East coast I'm afraid all the hundreds and hundreds of central  US folks and
West Coasters will get disgusted and loose all interest and this whole thing
will die an ugly death.

And Leo, if you're out there, drop us a line and let us know you're OK!  If
you no longer have the time to deal with this, no sweat - we all understand.
We thank you for your work up to this point and wish you the best.
