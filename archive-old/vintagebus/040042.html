Though I'm not the same Steve as you are talking to, I'm also Steve and a 
registered locksmith in Texas servicing primarily VW.  I have seen the &quot;T&quot; 
profile (64-66 bus) with the cutout both ways.  It appears to vary by key 
blank manufacturer.  I have no reference showing a manufacturer change 
during that run, however.  I'm happy to try to answer any other lock 
questions where possible.
