Hello all and a belated Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

I've been reading this list for a little while now since I had intended on
getting an old bus. Well after much adventure and about 5 months more
time that I expected I have it sitting in my garage now. Delivered via
rail and flatbed from Vancouver BC to Calgary AB just in time for the new
year. This is my first aircooled VW. I've been wanting one for about 11
years now.


Stay posted for a link to the site and the typical before shots and all
the details as I go. All I know about this bus for certain is that I'm
lucky to have it. There seems to be a 1600 SP motor in it (code AH
rebuilt 1.5k miles ago) solid braking system with shiny new brake lines
and drums in great shape, all the lights work and are there. It turned
over and started after almost 2 years of not having been started on the
first attempt. There are no leaks of any kind, the tires didn't even need
a squirt of air.

Interior is a bit of a mess in the back. 

Underneath a fibreboard home made fallen headliner painted blue with a
border of moons and a hairy eye was a non split case
tranny, original motor minus heads, scungy sink cabinet with flip over
counter and side seat, blue carpet overtop lyno covering the
floorboards and A fold out westy bed from what is probably
from the 70s complete with some misc side cabinets. Also there was a
single piece of glass for one of the windshields up front and a brand new
tranny in the wrapper that is a correct fit for this bus.


Up front she came complete with;

3 inch virgin mary glued to the dash, freshly recovered bench. 

This bus needs primarily a good sand/bead blasting, a few bits of metal
replaced, every body seal and interior panel in the catalogue and a proper
paint job. Previous owner had the van in storage due to the self
diagnosis of it needing a new tranny. However it appears to drive in all
gears and only makes noise in neutral. I'm thinking that the throwout
bearing is gone or something. There are no metal shavings noticable when I
drained the tranny fluid.

The number plate is faily short on numbers. Any help decifering these
would be great, again all I really know is that this thing is in good
mechanical shape with non original bits and looks like a 59 panel I have
the lists pointing to chassis numbers and the sort but am not certain as
to how they relate to the plate and locations of the various numbers. The
plate reads as follows;

[LEFT ALIGN] 13 03 9
[BLANK]
[BLANK]
[BLANK]
[LEFT ALIGN] 387 178
[LEFT ALIGN] KA 211 GREY  449127

59 Panel...probably....
