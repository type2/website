Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel alignment
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,
Clara and Greg's instructions are good, but left out an important beginning 
proceedure.  You must find the center point of the steering box.  To do this 
it is best to have the front end jacked up to the point that the front wheels 
are just off the ground.  Then turn the steering wheel from one direction to 
the other counting how many turns (Or as we prefer to count half turns.) it 
takes.  Next turn the steering wheel to the halfway point of the steering box 
turns.  Get out and check by eye that the front tires are straight.  If not 
then you need to change the drag link length.  DO NOT CHAGE THE PITMAN ARM 
POSTION!  Unless at any postion the steering wheel/box are that the pitamn 
arm ends up parallel with the drag link which will allow the steering to lock 
up!
  After all of that take the bus out driving and take note of the steering 
wheel position while going straight on flat non-crowned roadway.  If the 
steering wheel is a little off center you just need to fine tune the drag 
link length.  
  It is a really good idea to also take the link pins from the trailing arms 
and remove one by one the link pins from the king pins to allow you to 
totally clean the old grease/dirt/rust out of there.  Make very sure the 
outer link pin covers have thier old grease drain hole clear.  Otherwise if 
these holes are not clear only about half the link pin length gets new 
grease!  Once you have cleaned up everything you need to check the offst of 
the trailing arms and make sure to shim them properly.  Put everthing 
together and check toe in and road test!
