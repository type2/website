&lt;&lt; The PO of my 67 Westy removed the thermostat from the 1600 dual port. I 
think the motor is from a 71 by looking at the air shroud. Why did they do 
this? Is this safe to run? Will I have heat in the cold mornings?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
     The biggest reasons for volks taking out or not installing the 
thermostatic bellows/flaps system is they were to lazy and/or they just did 
not understand the errors of thier ways.  Others, due to thier huge 
intellects believe they can reason why the flaps are of no use or hiderance 
to thier engine without any real world testing.  After all VW did not know 
what they were doing with this thermostatic system since about 1950 in all 
thier ACVWs for Nothern countries away from the equator.  Right?
     It will not hurt you to run without the thermostat, but it will hurt 
your engine in the long run if you deal in outside temps below 70F. 
1. Due to the engine not getting up to or at least not reaching operating 
internal temp. for quite a while, the oil will not lubricate properly.  This 
operating tempatures are about 160F to somewhere about 210F to 230F.  Too hot 
of temps., and the oil gets too thin causing too much wear, and tear.  Too 
low of oil temps., and the oil does not get into places it should, to 
lubricate properly to the full extent it would at the proper temp. range!
2.  On top of this the pistons will not swell to thier proper operating 
diameter in thier cast iron cylinders (Aluminuim swells faster/more than cast 
iron so the cylinder have to be a bit too big when the engine is cold.) so 
they will wobble in them!  This causes about half that clatter noise you get 
when starting your cold engine.  The other about half of the clatter is from 
the valve linkage not having expanded to the point that it no longer has so 
much space between all the parts (Cam, tappets, push rods, rocker arms, and 
valves!) to clatter!  Both of which goes away when the engine starts to reach 
the proper operating temps.  Both causes of clattering reduces your MPG, and 
HP.
3.  Plus the rings will not seal both to not being at the proper running 
temp., but also due to the piston wobble.  
4.  The intake manifold will not properly warm up , and fuel will not 
vaporize as well.  Resulting in raw gas getting into the cylinders washing 
away the oil from the rings.  Which in turn wears the rings out sooner.
5.  The raw fuel that gets by the rings ends up in the oil which dilutes the 
oil, and worse yet starts to turn the oil to an acid sooner.  Due to this VW 
reccommended instead of the 6 months or 3,000 miles whichever came first, to 
instead change oil every 1,000 miles or once a month in VW driven in extreme 
Canadian cold or when driven in town very short distance driving here, and 
there all the time, even when the outside tems are up to the 70s F!
