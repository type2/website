Subject: ANCO wiper arm bushing

I'm trying to find this wiper arm mounting bushing.
I'm guessing it's called a bushing. It has two set
screws in it that fasten it to the wiper shaft. It is
made by ANCO. I couldn't find it anywhere with Google.
 Can anyone give me a source for these? Here's the
link to a photo of it...  It is shown with the
mounting bushing attached to the wiper shaft and the
wiper arm detached from the bushing.
