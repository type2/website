Well, Foo-neck-betty is back on the road.  Installed the top-end rebuild last
week ran it for about 25 miles, changed the oil and did the shake-down cruise.
 I had the timing all wrong and got the engine quite hot at one point.  I had
it way advanced, 7.5 atdc, and then realized it should be 5 btdc.  However,
still running sluggish and was wondering how one determines the right timing
setting on these (1600DP).  I've check the manuals and what I have is an AS
case which was for a later bug w/ fuel injection.  I'm running a stock
distributor and the 34 PICT-3 Carb.  What should the timing be on this? 
There's only the TDC notch on the pulley.  It is running alittle warm at 5
BTDC.  Anyway to optimize??
