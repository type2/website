I know of 2 who can do this depending on where you are.  You can contact 
Steve Sandlin at vwcarlocks_at_hotmail_dot_com in, I believe, Texas but I don't 
recall offhand.  The other alternative is Gabriels VW Garage in Stockton 
California.  Gabriels was at the Red Barn thing and said he would be at KP 
but I didn't see him when I rolled through early on but he can be reached at 
gabvwkey_at_cs_dot_com or (209) 475-0868.  I am sure there are others but I don't 
know of them yet.

Haven't used either one but my contact with Steve via pmail was very 
positive esp. references and knowledge.  Don't know to much about Gabriel 
yet.

&gt;
&gt;Wasn't there someone on the list who's a Locksmith?  If not does anyone 
&gt;know
&gt;if any Locksmith can re-key locks so one key fits all?  Whether I fix the 
&gt;67
&gt;panel or buy this 65 I'm looking at, some of the handles need replacing.
&gt;
