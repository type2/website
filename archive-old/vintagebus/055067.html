Subject: Re: [VB] Pomona/Westy racks/seats

I got an NOS rear bumper overrider for $35.  Not a real big acquisition, but not
bad either.  Passed on a Sundial tent with no poles for $200.  Will probably
wish later that I had at least gotten the guy's phone number, since it hadn't
sold before I left.

&gt;    One of the best Pomona's I ever had, why I don't know, could it have been
&gt; the Westfailure drawing all the people over? There were ton's of good parts
&gt; and deals. I got a real nice Allstate 1 wheel trailer for 100 dollars and
&gt; found a few other goodies. Pressed bumper city, if you needed one they were
&gt; there and at GOOD prices. A lot of nice buses for sale fair prices.
&gt;    There were a lot of the Westy repo rack's there for sale, I'm down to my
&gt; last 2 out of 10. One is going on my Westy and I'm thinking of putting the
&gt; other on my one wheel trailer. The importer is sold out of these racks and I
&gt; was just informed that they do not have a PO issued for any more yet, so it
&gt; will/could be over or a few months till more are brought in. Those of you
&gt; that got one them are lucky and if you want one of these get it while you
&gt; still can.
&gt;    Where did all the middle seats go?? POMONA, I saw at least 5 of them
&gt; there for sale, one really nice 64-66 original upholstery for 400 dollars, 3
&gt; more full width and one 2/3 there, but only one rear seat.

&gt; ps. the drive out in the Westfailure was a thrill in itself, all the looks,
&gt; people coming up to you at every gas stop and the advantage of cruising at
&gt; 80-85 mph with-out being affected by the wind or trucks.
