&gt; 240 will work, i just hope you may have put a drop of loctite on it to
help.
&gt;
No I did not. I broke the bar trying to get the flywheel off the old engine
to compare.

&gt; the o-ring may blend in to the flywheel.  you should pry the old one out
&gt; with a screwdriver.  this is a critical sealing surface.  not replacing it
&gt; may cause leaks.
&gt; YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE 3 SHIMS FOR END PLAY ADJUSTMENT. sounds like
something
&gt; is not right if you have &quot;.005&quot; and 2 shims.

&gt; &gt; Update: The engine is out of the 71 and I saw that the front seal was
&gt; &gt; leaking. Off with the flywheel to replace but could not see any evidence
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; an &quot;o&quot; ring, or the gasket between the crank and flywheel. I put it back
&gt; &gt; together with a new front seal and no gasket the same way it came apart.
&gt; Did
&gt; &gt; I mess up?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The end play the way I did it was .005&quot;. This is without the gasket and
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; the two shims that were there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, I torqued to 240 per Muir, but read 253 in Bentley tonight. Is
that
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; big deal?
