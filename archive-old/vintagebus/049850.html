Subject: Re: [VB] Hardware for middle seat

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;Can I use the hardware from a late model bus' middle seat for my '66?
&gt;Or does anyone have hardware lying around that I can buy?  Thanks


This stuff comes up on Ebay so often that I don't include it in my 'Ebay
stuff' posts.  I'll include it the next few times I see it.
