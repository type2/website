Subject: cleaning hardware

Hey y'all.
I've been quiet lately due to life being REALLY hectic as of late.  Got a 
question though for you restorers.

I was thinking that a really good way to clean all the hardware (nuts, bolts, 
misc little bits) would be to run them through my rock tumbler with some 
medium grit for a day or so.  scrub thoroughly to remove the grit and voila!  
shiny clean pieces parts.

Whaddaya think?
