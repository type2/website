Subject: Re: [VB] Wisdom of the elders, part 2 (Gear oil)

Another tip on the gear oil. Heat it up (safely) before pumping. Moves a =
lot easier and lets air pockets out of the gear boxes faster. The stay-in =
tip works very well, I did an oil change on the '66 yesterday.=20

Here's another hint: when you buy the pump, go down to the FLHS
(friendly local hardware store) and replace the little output=20
tube with a 4' long one.  Then you don't have to acutally have
the container under the car with you. =20
