&gt; &gt; The record turns at a constant angular velocity, so the further you are
&gt; &gt; from the pivot the faster the record surface moves under the needle.  The
&gt; &gt; record is recorded to compensate for this.  Vinyl Killer moves at a
&gt; &gt; constant speed so the music seems to speed up as it approaches the center
&gt; &gt; of the record.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly sir
&gt; Constant angular velocity as opposed to
&gt; Constant linear velocity
&gt; CLV/CAV like the 2 flavors of laser disks.
&gt;
&gt; BTW cds are CLV so the disc spins slower the farther out it gets.
&gt; and cds play from the inside out. slower and slower.....

Yes, and that leads to the interesting fact that a real 52X CD drive would
have to spin at such a high rate on the inner tracks that it would fly
apart at something like 30K RPM.  They weasel out of this by only reading
52X on the outer tracks.  There's an interesting page on the 'net
that shows the results of overspeeding a CD.  Google &quot;exploding CD rom&quot; to
find the page.

IIRC, most actual CD drives now spin at constant speed and buffer the
data.  They're cheaper to build that way.

Bus content:  Anyone have a good experience with a CD changer combined
with a small control remote control head?  Sounds like a good solution for
those who wish to leave their dashes uncut.
