Subject: Re: 71 beam on 67?
Message-ID: &lt;498dd152.24404d6c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

The 68-69 beam bolts directly to the 67.  I am told that the 71 beam does
not. It has ball joints and is about 1 1/2 inches higher than the king pin
front end as Eric and Barb note. To get discs onto this beam, just mount the
spindles that you have on your 71 parts Bay window. The Backing plates hub
carriers, discs and calipers just bolt on. You can use the 67 dual circuit
master cylinder, the booster is not necessary. But you will need to get a 2
LB &quot;check valve&quot; from your local motor sports store to put in line with the
front disc circuit. if you don't, the run out of the discs will push the pads
away from the disc and you will need two or three pumps of the pedal to stop.
The buses that came with discs have this built into the master cylinder. you
will also need to take the pressure reducer from the rear brake circuit from
the donor bus to keep the rear drum happy.
OR you could avoid replacing your beam by buying the &quot;Ball Joint adapter
torsion arms&quot; that Bus Boys sells. These bolt directly to king pin beams like
yours, come with the ball joints attached and will take the 71-72 spindles or
the 73-79 spindles that will allow you to install the larger rotor and
caliper found on this later Bay. You will still need to install the check
valve and pressure reducer.
I installed the 69 beam several years ago when my king pins were shot,
planning to do the disc conversion later.  I recently did the conversion and
installed the Albatross front beam from bus boys to lower it back to stock
height. I hated the higher ride height. The cost was a good bit higher than
the recently introduced Adapter torsion arms would have been. I would have
done it with the adapters if they had been available when I started the
project. I don't know if the adapters still give the 1 1/2 inch lift. It was
not a question that I asked when I called bus boys because it didn't apply to
me.
The Albatross beam is not as easy to adjust as the directions suggest, in my
experience.

My final result: MUCH better brakes, stock ride height, smoother ride with
the ball joints, slightly firmer pedal, and narrow 5 wheels on the front that
don't match the wide 5s on the back. So far I like it.
