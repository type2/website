here is the seat that i bought on ebay , can someone please take a look and
give me some pointers on installing this in my 66 deluxe, i do not have the
cabinet that goes under it, nor have i ever seen one, my questions are
how is it attached to the cargo floor?, or does it sit in a box like the bay
window ones?
does the seat sit all the way to the passenger side, or in the middle?
can someone give me dimensions on the cabinet, pictures?

thanks  for any help
