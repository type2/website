Subject: roadtrip spares

What I do is basically I have the same list as Thom but I completely
assemble a spare dizzy with good points, condenser, cap and rotor or with a
good electronic ignition module in it. I leave the plug wires all attached.
I also carry a spare &quot;tested&quot; coil. When we went to Baja in my 60 crew cab
I took a rebuilt carb as well. Most of this stuff can be rummaged at swap
meets. Just make sure they work before you need them. Nothing like carrying
worthless weight. A spare fuel pump is one more thing that fits nicely. I
use an old ammo box to carry my spares in. Believe it or not with careful
packing it all fits.
Good luck on your trip,

ps - remember the more you bring the less chance that you will have any
trouble.
don't forget a manual - even if you know everything in your garage, at
midnight on the side of a deserted highway it is nice to have some
reminders of what to look for.
