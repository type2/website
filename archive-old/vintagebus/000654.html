I just got my set of 4 15&quot; rims back from the powdercoater today!
It   only took them 3 days and I found a very close to original color of 
powder. It's called tech white (Serwin William's brand). Do they look great! 
The price was 140$
for   the sandlasting and coating(does that sound about right?).
Now off to the tire shop to pick out some rubber. What do you think 185's or 
195's for the old 59' panel?
