Subject: Re: [VB] Aircooled tshirts here for Christmas !

&gt;
&gt;Any pix of what the shirts look like in real life?
&gt;
&gt;Prices?  Ordering info?
&gt;


well no... i dont have a digital camera. my shirts are actually transfers. i 
have found, after many tries, transfers that wear extremely well. they come 
out pretty much exactly as you see em on the screen. i have sold to many a 
list member, maybe someone can speek up and vouch for their beauty.

thanks,

Bob Margiotti
