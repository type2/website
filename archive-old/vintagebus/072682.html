Subject: Lowering my bus...

Yeah, well that's a load of...
...bricks!

Went to HD today and picked up 100 paving stones to make a small driveway.
I pulled up to the loading area, gave the guy my receipt and told him what
I needed:
HD kid: OK, where's your truck?
Me: It's right here.
HD kid: &quot;No, I mean where is *your* truck, so we can put these in it.&quot;  
Me It's right here!
HD kid: You're going to need a truck to carry these home.  Did you bring one?
Me: *Yes*!  I'm putting them in my bus.
HD kid: You can't do that.
Me: Why not?
HD kid: Because they won't fit!
Me: Why not?
HD kid: (now with that peeved 'I know what I'm doing attitude) Because you can't!
Me: Watch.  Bring the bricks 'round and I'll show you.

So they bring a pallet of bricks, and they fit, of course.  I'd already done
the dimensional homework in my head.  A small crowd watched us load the stuff,
most of them wide eyed in shock.

When I got home, I weighed a few of the bricks.  They weigh about 19lbs each,
so that's 1900lbs of payload.  They bus was a big sluggish, and I would have
done well to have the tires up to proper pressure first.  Braking was a challenge,
but I took it slow and had no issues.

I would have used the double cab, but it's still full of crap from BOR, and
didn't feel like unloading it.  With the DC, they could have dropped the pallet
right on the bed and been done with it ('cept for the $15 pallet core charge!)
