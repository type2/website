My wife and I think that the VW Hearse it the coolest!   If I only had the 
kind of coin he is looking for to sell it, I would have bought it in an 
instant.

Can you imagine the looks you would get driving to work on those warm sunny 
summer days with a fake pine box coffin in the back!   It would be priceless 
and well worth the initial investment of the Hearse!!!!

That bus is just too flipppin cool! IMHO

What kind $ are we talking?  Rusted '65 kombi money?  Unrestored
23-window money?  Barrett-Jackson deluxe auction money?

I think you're facing the same problem that any special-body bus seller
faces: it's a cool bus, hands down, but what would someone *do* with it
if they bought it?  It's a little impractical for a grocery-getter,
Home Depot errand-mobile.  Sell it to that Malamute guy, he can add it
to the rest of the museum he's bought.
