Subject: Interesting Westy spice rack found

Hey Y'all,
I picked up a 67 parts bus last week, and in it I
found what appears to be a Westy or other camper spice
rack type thing. I was wondering if anyone could tell
me exactly what it is for before I try to sell or
trade it.  It appears to be a spice rack\table that
hangs on the inside of the cargo door, however, it is
not a traditional wooden westy spice rack. The shelves
and frame of the spice rack are made of black steel.
Then there is a table top (wood with a white formica
surface) that covers the spice rack and acts as a
&quot;door&quot; to close off the contents of the rack. The
table top is hinged at the top so it lifts up to
create a table and expose the metal shelves inside. 
It seems to fit on the inside of the cargo door, with
the top of the piece just below the inner handle (not
shaped with a notch to clear the handle as the
traditional wooden westy spice rack). Table surface
and steel frame\shelves are all in very good
condition.  Anyone have any ideas about this piece or
any interest in owning it??
