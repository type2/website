&gt; I need to install seatbelts for the back seat of my bus, so that my children

&gt; there anything in particular that I should know before I go about this 
&gt; project?

Hi Trinlie,
First remove the rear seat and look for plastic plugs screwed into the engine 
fire wall.  Those plugs unscrew to allow rear seat belts to be bolted in.  If 
you do not have these threaded holes in the sheet meatl you will have to 
remove the engine and fuel tank to cut and weld in these points from a 
1968-79 bus.  Then best to use retractable seat belts from a vanagon.
