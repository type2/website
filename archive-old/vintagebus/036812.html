Hello,

&lt;&lt; From: Mark Lytle &lt;singlecab_at_centralia.wednet_dot_edu&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;.. What if I want to keep the ride height on my truck but would 
     like higher gears. ....&gt;&gt;

This is on your '59??  Still have the split case transaxle in there?

You'll have several options.  First is that you can swap out the 
1.40 ratio redux boxes with the '64-'67 style 1.26 ratios.  That 
would mean from the transaxle out to include the brake drums
kind of swap. Second is to find a good '64-'67 Type II trans with
the 4.125 ring and pinion ratio.  Both of those swaps will net
you about 3-4 mph more (each) for the same rpm's your engine
is turning now.  Or, you could keep the 1.40 RBs and have a
3.44 ring and pinion with .89 4th post-1960 tunnel type trans
built.  While the 3.44 is an aftermarket ring and pinion, I have
built one for a local Bus owner and from a purely visual standpoint
the R/P set appeared to be of good quality and workmanship.
That particular transaxle has yet to be installed so I do not
have any feedback on its performance yet.
