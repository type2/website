Subject: too much hp?

Goooood morning!

I took the 62 out for about 100 mile drive last night.  Drove great, and
I bounced around quite a bit.  Gotta love driving a split :)  The seats
were comfortable, it rode great...great suspension...even better than
Stella (shhhhh!! don't tell her I said that!)  anyways...about 20-30
miles into the trip...then generator light comes on.  I'm going out to
figure out this one in just a bit.  I think its just the belt.  While
checking all of that out... I noticed I was leaking a good steady drip
from where the tranny and engine meet up.  I think its my tranny leaking
as when I was under there futzing with the motor and putting it back
in...I noticed that the tranny was wet and gunked up....I'll figure that
one out later today too.  Any suggestions?  This is the original tranny
with 208,000 miles on it.  It shifts like a dream, no growling,
grinding, or hard shifting at all.  I have all the receipts from the
last 23 or so years of the bus's life....all the maintenance receipts
that is.  The trans fluid was checked regularily, and was changed at
frequent intervals.  I wonder where its leaking from....  I didn't see
any leakage from the input shaft when I had the motor out.  The redux
boxes aren't leaking either...but just in case they decide to leak
sometime...I bought 2 sets of seals for them :)

another thing I noticed...
when I took out the motor, I replaced the main seal and checked end play
and all that good stuff.  I cleaned the clutch disc with brake cleaner
and cleaned it all up in there... there really wasn't much oil back in
there when I took it all apart...and now its sealed up well.  i have a
1600sp with a 6V flywheel and 180mm clutch.   It takes off good...and
drives good in gears 1,2, and 3.  When I shift into 4th it accelerates
fine if I don't give it a whole lot of gas.  The bus will cruise 60mph
with no problem but if I give her a good amount of gas, or floor
it...the engine just revs...like if I had an oil soaked clutch....but it
isn't.  could the 1600 be too much power for 180mm clutch??  It is a
sachs pressure plate....with all the little &quot;fingers&quot;...that kind.  The
clutch disc is very recent also.



All in all, a good trip.  I'm going to see if I can't fix that stuff
today...and then I'm off to drive it some more! woo hoo!  It also
appears that I got about 30 miles per gallon last night too...right
around there.  10 gallon tank...right?  and each 1/4 tank mark would
represent 2.5 gallons...right??

have a day everyone
