Sounds like you need a new drum at this point. It's dangerous to ride with
thin drums, and there is actually a legal limit, beyond which, a brake
shop will not turn a drum (at least here in CA there is). Better to
replace both rear drums together.

Be wary of drums that are not concentric (ie, the center hole is not
exactly in the center). Buy from reputable sources - try busdepot_dot_com or
OldVolks_dot_com, both are list-oriented sellers.

good luck,
