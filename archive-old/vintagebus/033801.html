&lt;&lt; this is actually something that can work in YOUR favor!  I have a box of
 old keys; new car (to me) w/ no keys.... try alla the ones in the box :)
 
 Once amazed an old-time scrapper; he had a 72 KGhia he wanted to strip, but
 the doors were locked, and he didn't want A) to bust the winders or B) pay
 a locksmith. I whipped out my 70 BUS key, and not only did it open the
 doors, it started the motor!
  &gt;&gt;
once I went to a party, and one guy had oops locked his key in the bus. They 
waited for me to show up before calling AAA, as they figured I cpould break 
into a VW.  I am not sure if that was a complement.  it was a 70, and one of 
the keys on my key ring (the one to my bug) opened his drivers door.  Not the 
other doors, just the most used one.  When compared, the key cut was only 
slightly similar.

For the paranoid types, I recommend a stock option steering lock.  Usually 
you can find one for around $100 to $125 at a VW show, I saw one at the RB, 
should have got it.  the fahrt start kind use an unique key , the 67 kind use 
the same key tumbler as a 68 on bus (or bug).

Its not like you need a key to start an old VW
