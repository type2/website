Subject: bad bus day/accident

I sure feel for you. I'm been much more at ease since leaving the big city 
environment and moving to a small town. I prefer repairing the original 
metal rather than welding something in. I'd want it done by someone who does 
it the old school way with hammer craftsmanship and a minimum of bondo. In 
the old days they used lead as a cheater instead of bondo. Someone on the 
Type2 list mentioned another filler that is superior to bondo these days.
