Subject: Re: 53  Inside dr. handle

Clara, aren't 53 inside dr. handles same as early bugs? with the
rib down the middle? If so I see them all the time at swap meets for
$5 to $10 each. If so I will buy them and list them. I might even have
a pair in the swap meet box myself. Won't look till I know if they are
the same.
