My favorite one on the 61 single cab is &quot;nice bus, but what happened to the
rest of it&quot;
Then there was the time some redneck in an early 70's $300 Lincoln town car
rusted out hulk cut me off just to tell me I should take my piece of sh*t
off the road. I still get a good giggle to this day on that one!! HA!! One
side gate alone was worth more than his whole car!!!

&gt; 
&gt; Here are some recent quotes from non-VW people at work about my '55
Kombi,
&gt; they can be entertaining:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;36 hp?  Don't you need at least 100 hp just to move it?&quot;
&gt; &quot;No one would steal it - it's a VW Bus!&quot;
&gt; &quot;Is this a 21-window?&quot;
&gt; &quot;I can't believe you drive this thing.  Why don't you get a normal car?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Isn't it dangerous to drive it on the highway?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Later,
