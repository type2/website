Hi Andy,
The jet gauge is a must have tool for the VW owner, but is a bit of a problem 
to find unfortunitly.  Better to buy a selection of jets new instead of just 
drilling and reaming jets bigger and bigger.   Mitsuno (SP?) main jets can be 
bought for $2.50 or less from Nipponese motorcycle dealers and fit Solex and 
Bocar carbs.  We have found the piolt jets for sale at Bow Wow auto parts 
stores up here.  The air correction jets are the nly ones we have not been 
able to find new.
