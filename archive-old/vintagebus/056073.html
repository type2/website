Subject: new engine blows two oil coolers

Hey Volks

I hope someone can shed some light on a mystery.

I have a 1600DP engine that has been sitting in my garage while I was
travelling. It was rebuilt about a year ago with new P&amp;Cs and new heads and
a counterweighted crankshaft in a Mexican dual-relief universal case, and
has been sitting on the bench ever since.

This weekend I prepared it for installation in my 63 Dormobile as the
Dormer's engine needs an oil leak fixed and a clean up. I installed the new
engine and almost immediately it started pouring oil from the region of the
oil cooler.

I removed it again and it looked like the leak was from the cooler itself,
so I substituted a known good cooler and reassembled with new oil seals.
When I put the engine back again and started it, same thing, a flood of oil
from around the oil cooler. When I removed the engine a second time it was
definitely leaking from the cooler itself. I removed the cooler and blew
into it and I could hear it was ruptured.

What could cause a new engine to blow up two oil coolers?

Some history on this engine: this is the second time it has been rebuilt to
this spec; the previous time it ran beautifully for nine hours before
mysteriously suffering a sudden major heat seizure.

Blocked oilways?
Too strong oil pump?
Relief springs too strong?

Anybody have any idea what's up with this engine?
