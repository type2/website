Hi Pete,
Well if you want stock appearance then you really have to go with a bias 
tire.  Stock size was 6.40-15&quot; (With about a 27&quot; diameter.).  Unfortunitly 
bias tires are not readily availible except by a few catalog order tire 
suppliers.  Due to this, plus better handling, less rolling resistance, many 
have changed over to radial tires.  For the pre-1963 buses the biggest one 
can run in a radial is a LT, or P, 205R15 (With about a 26.5&quot; diameter.) in 
the front, rear, but not always in the spare postion.  1963, and later buses 
with the later higher, wider rear wheel wells can run bigger diameter radials 
in the rear for lower RPMs at the same MPH, gearing.
