I recently purchased a SUV to tow dead VW's.
That's my rationialization anyway.  
My SO has other needs than VW.
(I already have the towbar from Dr. Joe)
It is only a 5 seater, but we need to occasionally
accomodate 7.  There is a company that makes
littlepassengerseats_dot_com to go in the back of
SUV's.  They are only two adults wide (without
the accompanying headroom) and have essentially
no legs (about 3&quot; above the floor).  Great for kids.
Sells for $560 and up if you add headrests, third
seatbelt, leather, etc.  Meets all CA safety codes.
My brother has one in his, we will too, but need
to wait as the money we spent on the rig sorta
exceeded the money we had available!

Extrapolating to VW size middle seat gets one
to $700 easily.  How many are you gonna buy?
I wouldn't expect anyone to sell enough to recoup
costs to build repros for VW busses.
A solo entrepeuneur could build one for themselves,
but to sell it, they would get paid at the rate hobby 
people get paid for their work (essentially nuthin').
Quilters, carvers, VW bus rebuilders, etc.

'67 Deluxe Hardtop
'99 dead VW hauler, not a VW though . . . . 
We spent the same $ as a new EurovanCamper
though, bummer . . . . I'd rather have the EV.

&gt;I know this is a worn out subject, but since the middle seat monster has gotten most of them, does any one know if someone has &quot;found that need and is filling it&quot; by repro-ing them?  I thought I'd ask.  Please be kind!
