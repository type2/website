Howdy all,

Just for fun, I bought myself an early Christmas/late birthday gift...a
webcam! The webcam is up and running now, and will be during the party
tomorrow. If you can't make it in person, point your browsers to
http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/webcam  to watch it remotely.

(The cam is up and running now, but all it is doing is looking out the
window on my driveway.)

Just a reminder that the &quot;official&quot; time is 2pm-6pm. 

Maureen and I  will be running around in the morning picking up last minute
supplies, but we should be back by 12:00 noon...so feel free to stop anytime
after noon.

Hope to see a bunch of you there!
