Hi All
I have a 67 Double Cab.  While performing a brake adjustment on Sunday, I
noticed the master cylinder boot was damp, leading me to believe the master
is leaking.  The pedal is still solid, though.  Is this something that can
be rebuilt, like a wheel cylinder, or am I better off biting the bullet and
buying a new one?

Also, my front brakes require adjustment every month or so, I am missing the
little tabs that hold the adjusters, is this my problem there?

Thanks!!!!
