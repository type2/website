Hello,     I have a little question. I've changed my flasher for my turn
signals twice in the last month and can't figure out why  I'm running a
6volt flasher and I have a 12volt system with a resistor up front. I've
also noticed that a wire in the wiring area a yellow wire with a dual
female end seems to get hot. That wire is not hooked up to anything but
I'm sure it should be, but why the heat? Should I try a 12volt flasher
or is the problem elsewhere? I've tapped up any bare wires I've found so
I don't think I'm shorting out. The turn signals work fine when the
flasher isn't going out on me. I just thought turn signals would be nice
to have full time, not that most people around here ever use the damn
things. Any and all ideas and help is much appreciated.
Thanks Shawn
