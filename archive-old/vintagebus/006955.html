That's all I use, except 195/14 a little taller and wider, Have about 36000
on them and about a little less then half the tread left, am going to
replace with the same next show season, bad part is they due ride a little
harsh with 65 lbs of air though

Subject: [VB] Nankang tire info


At work today I was workin on a 1 ton Toy_at_ta, something about the tires
caught my eye.... It said &quot;replaces 5.50-14&quot; hmmmm, so I read on...
Heres the scoop,

NANKANG 185r14c 102/100n tubeless (replaces 5.50-14)
radial LT, max load 1870lbs _at_ 64 psi cold, load range D
side wall 2 ply polyester, tread area 2 ply polyester, 2 steel plys.

Ive tried regular P185-14's , Continentals, and the old weather cracked
wore 5.60-14 bias plys felt much better than the new radials, course the
radials are P rated...
Just wondering if anyones used these Nankangs, or even herd of them...
Also, any tire folks out there know what the 102/100n things about?
 Thanks,
David Pierce
