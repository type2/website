&lt;dianakrebs_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt; (Diana Krebs) asked:

&gt;&gt;I bottomed out about four times, bent my muffler and sheared off the
&gt;&gt;horn wire where it exits the bottom of the steering column.  I was
&gt;&gt;driving a bit too fast since it was getting dark and we still had to
&gt;&gt;set up camp.  So I guess this weekend I'm fixing the horn wire. 
&gt;&gt;Anybody know the best way to feed a new wire through? 

Geez, slow down, eh!  Specially on rough roads!  Get a Coleman lantern
for pitching tents in the dark, etc.

&lt;djersey_at_shadow_dot_net&gt; (Dave Jersey) replied: 

&gt;&gt;If any wire can be gotten to through the botton, securely wrap the
&gt;&gt;new wire to the old, making sure you can fit it through the hole in
&gt;&gt;the bottom of the column.  I found it helps a great deal to remove
&gt;&gt;the horn button first.  You could also feed the wire up from the
&gt;&gt;botton if it's stiff enough to allow this.  Again, it helps to remove
&gt;&gt;the horn button (really I learned that the hard way ;=} 

Dave is right, remove the horn button first, and disconnect the horn 
wire from it.  The set screw that holds the wire in place is quite
small, but a jeweler's screwdriver will fit it just fine.

If you have a few inches of wire below the steering box, gently pull it
up a few inches to give yourself some extra working room.  Don't pull
too hard, because it's easy to stretch and break it.  If there isn't
any extra wire down below, don't pull up on it at all.  You can
probably grip it from the bottom using a pair of needle nose pliers. 

Working inside the cab, strip off an inch or so of insulation, and flay
the strands of the wire a little bit, so that they extend outward
slightly.  If they are discolored, scrape them with a knife blade until
they're clean and bright. 

Do the same thing with a new piece of 16 or 18 gauge wire.  The new 
wire should be long, if you have a whole roll, just leave it on the 
roll for the moment.  Push the ends of the two wires together, and 
press the strands as flat as possible.  Don't twist the wires, as doing 
so will create a &quot;knot&quot; that won't pass through the steering column.

Solder the wires together very well, and let them cool.  Once the wires
are cool, use a file to remove any excess solder that sticks out.

If you have a helper, the next step is easier.

Gently pull the original wire from the bottom, while simultaneously 
feeding the new wire in from the top.  If all goes well, you will be 
able to get the new wire all the way down through the steering column.

Sometimes this works, and sometimes not.  The old 18 gauge wire may
stretch, jam, or break.  If that happens, you need some welding rod
(oxy-acetylene, not arc welding rod).  If you can get the broken wire
all the way out of the steering column, do so.  If not, use a piece of
1/8&quot; welding rod to poke down from the top, pushing the broken wire,
while someone pulls on it from below.

Once you've cleared the old wire from the steering column, solder or, 
better still, if possible, braze a new wire to the end of a 1/8&quot;,
3/32&quot;, or 1/16&quot; welding rod, and feed it from top to bottom, as
described above.

You may have to bend the welding rod just a bit if it interferes with 
the headliner when you first insert it into the steering column.  Try
not to bend it any more than absolutely necessary --- the straighter it
is, the easier it is to feed through the steering column.  If your
welding rod is shorter than the length of the steering column,
carefully butt weld two rods together. 

Be sure to pull plenty of extra new wire through the steering column.  
Wire is cheap, and so are welding rods.  You can trim the new wire to 
an appropriate length once you've gotten it well past the bottom of the 
steering gear box.
