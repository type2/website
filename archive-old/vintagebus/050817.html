Subject: Re: [VB] Electric fuel pump

buy a &quot;912-FPMP&quot; (worldpac part number).  it's a rotary fuel pump with
correct pressure for a carb. it's a stock replacement pump for a porsche
912 (i'm pretty sure). it's german made and lasts alot longer than a facet
pump. a bit pricy at around $70, but worth the non-hassles of it. put a
filter before it to stop crud from the fuel tank getting in it.
available at foreign aide, albuquerque  1-800-658-5712. maybe ronnie caries
them too. shops who order from worldpac can order them no problem.

&gt; I removed one from that location on my bus when I got it, it was
&gt; fuelling a pair of Weber 48's! But for a stocker carb I would be kinda
&gt; scared of an electric pump, it doesn't take much pressure to overcome
&gt; the needle valve in your carb float bowl, then you could have
&gt; dangerous gas leaks...
&gt; If you put on an electric pump you should make certain (like test it
&gt; yourself) that it doesn't put out any more pressure than the needle
&gt; valve can handle.
