Subject: Classic weekend -not really a Ripoff

the city of Irvine came down on Kimball this year with lots of extra` fees 
along with the vendor fee.......VW`Jamboree just had the same problem.........

As far as swap spaces, as I recall you get 2 passes with each swap space, so 
that cuts the space down to $25 extra, I am not sure how cheap you want it to 
be ????
even $15 to get in , I think it was the same last year and I think you can 
get discounted tickets if you buy them early........

Your show at Havasu is great but its mostly volunteers, Kimball has to pay 
for all of his people , plus the site etc.......

Sure OCTO is cheaper.........its also smaller, and volunteer workers.....

Hopefully you will make enough money at OCTO so you can spend a little of it 
to get into Classic.....it seems like a long drive to be worried about the 
few extra bucks in costs......and its only once a year..........

See you there,
