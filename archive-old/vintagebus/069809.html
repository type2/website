&gt; Well in the next gen of busses, bay windows, they were essentially put
&gt; there. The air ducts are angled to create some sort of &quot;scoop&quot;

Bzzzzzt!  Wrong!

Take a closer look at the &quot;scoops&quot; on a baywindow.  The opening is only a
few degrees away from being flat to the sides of the bus.  No ram effect
there!

Before you gotch up your bus with scoops, figure out why the cooling
system isn't working properly.  Scoops won't fix bad seals, missing tin,
etc.
