Pretty interesting.  Didn't the post 67 busses open up to bring
air in from the front of the engine?  You could screen it off some to
prevent big stuff from getting in.  This is something I've thought of. Not
this solution, but that the vents don't let enough air in.  I've thought
of ways to put scoops on without drilling the body, but this is so much
better if it works.  I don't think you'd get that much water up in there
from the road.  Maybe could put scoops into the front tin also.
Do the exhausts for your oil cooler go out where the regular heater hoses
normally go?
This seems like a really good idea.  I'm interested in pros and cons from
the list.
