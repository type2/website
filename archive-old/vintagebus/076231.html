Subject: Re: [VB] '65 trans/clutch slipping?

I heard an interview with Dick Army the other day on the telly. He made a
quip to the effect of you can say just about anything you want about someone
as long as you end it with &quot;God bless em&quot;.

.....

Took the first drive in the bus in 2-3 months the other day.

I'm getting very little power in 1/2 gear, and when I try to wind it out or
do anything else with an amount of torque, I'm getting a massive vibration.

I'm assuming my clutch is slipping. I'm thinking it's possible that my
flywheel/clutch were fouled during the time it sat.  My wife cleaned the
engine with simple green/garden hose &amp; it's doubtful that she was extremely
careful, god bless 'er.
