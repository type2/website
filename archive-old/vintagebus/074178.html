Subject: Bay tank into split - filler neck

Seeing the other thread about bay tanks, I have sourced myself an excellent
condition early bay tank which I wish to fit to my bus over the winter,
however the split tank I have in my bus at the moment is in perfect
condition and I would feel guilty chopping the filler neck off.

I was wondering whether a late beetle filler neck would be able to be used
these use a similar rubber piece to hold the neck to the body IIRC.

Anyone got any other ideas?  I guess I could just post this tank up for
swaps with someone in the UK who has a rusty tank.

Thanks
Paul
