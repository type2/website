Subject: Transaxle prices

I found a guy that has a '66  transaxle drum-to-drum for sale that he's
willing to take $130 for.  It looks all original, no rust or cracks and
everything seems to turn/shift OK. The trans shaft wobbles about an
1/8th in.  It's covered with road grime.  There's one bolt broken off in
one of the redux boxes. The drums seem good, but I haven't measured
them.  He was going to use it in a dune buggy, but decided to go with a
later IRS setup 'cause if it broke he could get parts for the IRS
easier.  Which is why I'm looking at it - spare parts for our '67.  It
seems like a decent price.  Anything else to look for ?
