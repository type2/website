Subject: 'Crying Bus' T-shirt is back!

The original &quot;Crying Splitty&quot; tee-shirt is back, after nearly ten years!

This tee-shirt features a reprint of the Rolling Stone ad that VW ran when
Jerry Garcia died, featuring the famous &quot;crying splitty&quot; image. 

This tee-shirt, sold by VW through their dealer network, was VW's most
popular clothing item until they discontinued it in the late 1990's. For
some reason they have now &quot;un-discontinued&quot; it again.  This makes a great
Christmas gift.  The price is $12.95 and they're in stock (along with some
other shirts for kids).

It's on my Gift Items page:
