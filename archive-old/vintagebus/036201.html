warm. Got to stay home from work. Looks like a good day to play with 
my engine rebuild in the shop. Guess I'll definatly swap out the 
J-pipes that were on there for a set of the heat boxes I've 
collected. Is there a clear cut way to tell the bus ones from the bug 
ones?-  - - - - -

no snow here yet.   Been rel mild.   But in terms of heater boxes, yup I am 
glad I have them in my bus.   The splitty uses the same as the bug heater 
box, the arm for attaching the heater cable points down.    The ones for the 
bay window point up.   Becaus ethe bay windows have a higher located heater 
cale than the bugs/splitts.  


the heater cale control arm for a spit has two holes in it, one of which has 
the bit the heater cable attaches to.     some (bugs?) have one hole, which 
is further out.  I am making this convoluted and non sensical explaintion 
because in a split if you use the lower place on the lever, you only get half 
of the range of turning the heat on/off.  Due to distance the knob pulls the 
cable up front, you need to use the place on the levr closer to the pivot.    
 

think there is something in the Bentley about this too, which may have a 
picture even.
