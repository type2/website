Assuming the decklid is original to the bus.
Its atleast post May-1956.
Leaving only about 90 days for a &quot;1956 model year&quot; bus, chances are you have 
a 57 standard sunroof.
These were originally imported into the states.
Pay the dealership and extra 130$ bucks and its yours!
Yes, rare bus.
I had a June 1957 sunroof standard and I screwed up big time by shipping the 
roof to Europe while leaving the rest here! DOH!

&lt;&lt; Greetings all! I have recently acquired a 195? standard sunroof bus. I have

placed it on the vintage bus auction =

(http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/auction/addbid.cgi?number=3D1280),

but am really wanting to learn some more about this bus. Being a standard

sunroof, I know it was never officially imported to the states. I still dont

know what year it is. I'd love to trade this thing for a 21 window or D/S

Cab. Mebbe other possibilities as well. It is just a bit more than I can

handle right now. Anyone with some info or interest

please let me know. Thanks in advance!
