&gt; OK, after some calls and a trip north I was able to get the original

&gt; the mounting screws on the regulator.  I did not hook up the blue wire to
&gt; the generator light, yet.  It is still not charging. Did I miss something?
&gt; Is there any way to test the alternator or regulator?  These things cost 50+
&gt; new, the regulator that is.  Thanks

Hook up the wire.  It may be needed to energize the field so the
alternator will work.
