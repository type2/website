Subject: Re: [VB] What size compressor for blasting?
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Over the last couple of weeks I've been spending my free time sand blasting
&gt;my window frames. I'm getting close to being done. Wish I didn't have to
&gt;wait for my compressor to catch up all the time. I've got a 5hp 20 gallon
&gt;compressor. What size would be good to run a pressurized TIP 70-s
&gt;sandblaster?

Rex,

The rating you need to look at on your compessor is not the HP, but the
CFPM, or cubic feet per minute.

Most pressurized blasters with a small blast tip will run around 12-14 CFPM
at 100 PSI.  If you are running a HVLP spray gun, you will need more CFPM.
Even though the HVLP runs at a low PSI, it takes a larger volume of air.

Most pumps that run high CFPM are 2 stage with a fairly high HP motor (5-7
HP).
