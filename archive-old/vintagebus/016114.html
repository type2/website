Yes, that's correct.  Dunno why they did that.  All the ones I've seen
had them only on the fronts, although you'll have the holes in the back.
Don't see any reason why you couldn't add a second set back there.

On the two '60 panels I got last year, the one that was built 11/59
did NOT have the covers, the other one built in 3/60 did.  Being
a double-door, it had covers on both *forward* doors, but not the
rearward doors.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;     Can someone please tell me if high hinge cargo doors all came with hinge
&gt; covers?
&gt; Or did only the front door come with covers ? or if this was an option ?
&gt; My '60 so23 Westy only has covers on the front door hinges.
