As many environmental people will know....


If you need to work or weld on feul tanks etc....
The safest way to deal with a feul tank ect. is to put dry ice into it. This
advice is late I know, but it is better late then never.

Take a tank you want to weld on, put many pieces of dry ice in it.  What is
many? Alot for safety, The idea is to make sure the dry ice is making a lot
of &quot;steam&quot;. Dry ice is carbon dioxide. This will replace the oxygen and keep
any fuel tank from exploding.
