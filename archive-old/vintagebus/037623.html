Hey Eric and Barb,  thanks for that info.  I had replaced the bits before but 
didn't know you could use the bug bases.     Hm, WW  1999  catalog says the 
german bug ones are $35 each,(  the non german ones are $8.50).    each Is 
that what you have been buying them for, or do you use another source?

Hi John,
Best way we found to replace a broken bus wing window latch is to fix it!  
Almost all bus wing window latches when they break is in the base casting.  
We buy the new original pre-1967 bug wing window latches.  The base casting 
in 55-67 bus and 53-66 bug is the same!  Remove the pin that holds the bug 
handle/latch to the base casting.  Then lightly sand the bug chrome base by 
hand (Though having it powder coated would be better!) primer, and black 
paint the base to match the bus wing window latch.  Then install the bus 
latch handle pieces/parts (Replace any of the internal bus wing window parts 
with the bug pieces.) with graphite grease to increase latch lifespan!
