Subject: help identify middle seat

Hey folks,

I've been asked a few times to identify the years that the middle seat I'm
selling is correct for.  Frankly I haven't got a clue except that I know
it's for splitties, and that it isn't correct for walkthroughs since it's a
full bench.  Would there be a difference in the middle seat that came with a
standard/kombi/deluxe?  See it at http://www.jps_dot_net/pperez/middle.htm .
