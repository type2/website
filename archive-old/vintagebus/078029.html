Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

I put some pics of the tool here

It's a bit agricultural but its popped a LOT
of kingpins. Takes about a minute to make.

Plate actually measures 140mm x 60mm.  Legs are
280mm long (guessed wrong in my previous post).
The legs are close enough together to engage each
end of a link pin but wide enough to slip over
a spindle so you can press down on a old pin
inserted in the top link pin carrier.

here's a pic of my press
