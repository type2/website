Hi Everyone,

If you read my first post you know I just installed a brand new clutch
system and now my truck chatters really badly. The chattering is at take off
in first and reverse. The new clutch was added because my old one was
beginning to slip. When I pulled the engine, the old disc was down to the
metal on the pressure plate side and just glazed with oil on the other. I
replaced the engine main seal, disc, pp, and TOB.
We have nasty weather today, so I thought I'd use the time to get some more
info :-) The following are possible culprits from listees and my thoughts:

1. Bad transmission mounts- no chattering with old clutch, so I think the
transmission mounts are ok.
2. Too much bend in the cable sleeve- ok with old clutch also...I'm leaning
more towards something I did to be
     the problem.
3. Loose or bad gland nut- could be, the gland nut looked fine and I torqued
it on with 1/2 my weight and a 4' cheater bar. I only weigh about 125lbs.,
but I thought I got it tight enough?
4. Flywheel needs re-surfacing- This could also be the problem, though it
looked and felt very smooth. I lightly sanded with 100 grit sand paper and
cleaned with carb cleaner before installing the new disc and pp.
5. Improperly torqued pp bolts- Possibly... I went round and round 1/2 turn
each until the pp mated (funny) up with the flywheel. Then I gave them each
a 1/4 turn more...
6. My own question- the TOB looked slightly different than the one I
removed. It was the same size, just the part facing me once installed looks
a little different. I bought the TOB at the same time from the same company
as the pp, could they have given me the thee wrong part? The TOB is German
and the PP is Brazilian.

I don't mind pulling the engine again, but I really want to solve the
problem this time. What would you guys do to prevent this chattering on the
next go around?

Thanks,

Tom
