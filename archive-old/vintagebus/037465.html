Subject: Marklin VW Transport Train Set
Date: Fri, 12 May 2000 20:07:20 GMT
Message-ID: &lt;95816203601_at_mail.socket_dot_net&gt;


  I have a picture of the new Marklin VW Transport Train Set. It is supposed to 
be out sometime in the 2nd quarter of the year. But Marklin is notoriously slow 
about putting stuff out. 
  I've had a VW Beetle on order for two years. This Beetle is supposed to run 
on the actual train track. Something about radio freq. problems.
  If you want to see it goto http://members.socket_dot_net/~rickd/index2.html then 
click on VW Collectables Museum, goto the manufacturers section and click on 
Marklin. You'll get a discription and click on the name of the product for the 
pic.
