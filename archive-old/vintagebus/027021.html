Hey Eric and Barb,
        Thanks ,as always, for your great input!

    The stock Vw. strainer is also in the sump, and I feel pretty lame at
filtering.
So this sump/filter seems to be a vast improvement, no ?
Believe me,I doubt  it will ever come close to clogging!


                woody

ps. which brand oil-pump filter is the best quality?
I have never run a filter on any of my Vw's in the 25 years I've been drivin'
them.
But with motors becoming harder to find, and more $ ,I am now going for
longevity.

&gt; Hi Woody,
&gt; We have done this and so far we have not noticed any increase of oil temp or
&gt; loss of oil pressure due to this.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;The mini sump seemed like the simpliest easiet solution.  I'm glad to hear
&gt; you like it! It's funny but I never had heard anybody talk (good or bad)
&gt; about these sumps/filters ,so I was a little unsure whether to buy
&gt; one($59.95).It seems worth every penny. &gt;&gt;
&gt; The problem with the mini-sump filters is that they only work on the suction
&gt; side of the pump.  This means at most they have to operate on only up to
&gt; 18Lbs per Sq inch of vaccume at sea level.  Which is very little to make a
&gt; bypass filter valve to operate properly in conditions of cold oil or dirty
&gt; filter.  This vaccume become much less while driving through high mountian
&gt; passes!  Like ones we have traversed in Colorado of over 13,000 feet!  The
&gt; oil pump/filter setup on the other hand operates the filter on the pressure
&gt; side of the oil pump which reaches up to over 200 Lbs. per Sq. inch..
