Hi Troll,
You need to make sure the starter matches the flywheel.  Running anything 
more powerfull than a 1200cc 40HP engine requires a 200mm flywheel and 
clutch.  We have had nothing but trouble with anything but the 200mm nine 
spring clutch pressure plate.  Best to install a stock bus muffler and if you 
use a 1964 bus air cleaner you just need to jet the carburator (which should 
be a 34PICT-3 for a DP) just as a 1971 bus.  Then experiment with slightly 
smaller pilot and main jets and slightly larger air correction jet to lean it 
out just a bit since this engine will run a little too rich with the smaller 
earlier 1964 stock air cleaner.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS  While you are doing all of this it would be wise to check the cooling fan 
to make sure it is a 33, 34 or better yet 35mm wide inside measurement and if 
you do not have a doghouse fanshroud or thermostatic bellows system to 
install them for better longer engine life.  Eric&amp;Barb
