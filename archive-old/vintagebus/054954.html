&gt;By the way, when messing with gasoline and the fuel system at the back
of
 your Bus, you do have safety glasses, a fire extinguisher or two RIGHT
NEXT
 to you, and better yet someone there to put you and the Bus out in case
the
 unimaginable were to happen???  And with all that volatile fuel vapor
 about, work in a very well ventilated area, like outside.  No ignition
 sources anywhere nearby too!  I don't mean to sound pessimistic, but I
know
 you (thanks again for the coffee at the Camp Crusty), and would like to
 continue to know you for a long, long time to come!
&gt;
I always unhook the battery too, just in case.
