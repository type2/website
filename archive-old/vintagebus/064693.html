Subject: sunroof colours

the sliding roof cover 225 875 575 was made in a wide variety of colours (at 
least 12).    I see 289 blue white, but not beige grey.. hm maybe the SWR BG 
deluxes got a 225 Jupiter grey, or 573 light grey cover. I guess you could 
have special ordered any colour, but off the shelf I think it'd match the top 
paint colour.  ( there were colours to match commercials too, like if you had 
a turquoise sliding sunroof panel). If you look at the on line parts list 
you'll see that 'white' headliners' came in a variety of whites.  If you are 
looking to get a sunroofcover, they are probably available in a generic white.
