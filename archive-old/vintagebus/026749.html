&gt; Does anyone know how to properly tune Weber ICT carbs? 
&gt; 
&gt; There is only two adjustment screws and I cannot figure what to do with them? The carbs have been rebuilt and seem perfect... Except for the tuning of course.

Here's what I do. It's just the basic carb adjustment, but you do it
twice. The screw that sticks out of the carb body is the mixture screw.
The one that's right beside the butterly shaft is the idle speed
adjustment. It just opens the butterfly a little.

Step 1. Remove air cleaners.

Steb 1b. Make sure the linkage is all working right. The throttles need
to open at the same time.

Steb 2. start engine (It idles right? If it won't idle turn the mixture
screws in all the way and then out 3 turns and the idle screws in until
the throttle just opens a little.) Check linkage again if you adjust
anything.

step 3. Start turning one of the mixture screws in until the engine
slows down. Back it back out until the engine doesn't run any faster -
slowly - give the changes time to take effect. Find the spot where the
engine just reaches its fastest speed then turn the screw out 1/4 turn
more. Repeat on the other side.

Step 4. Set the idle sped with the other screws. You really need a
unisyn or other tool to balance the air flow, but you might be able to
get it even by ear. Just don't open one butterfly a lot more than the
other, keep things even between the sides.

Step 5. Grab the linkage and open the throttles fast. There should be no
spitting and backfiring. Spitting back though the carbs is a sign the
butterflys aren't opening together.

Step 6. Put the air cleaners back on.

Hope that helps. It's really pretty easy and doesn't need to be done
often.
