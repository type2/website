&gt;I like to pull off the bumper from the bus when I have to remove the
&gt;engine. [...]  My Westy doesn't have the usual reverse light setup
&gt;for '67, it's got a set mounted on the bumper, installed by the dealer.
&gt;[...] I was going to put it all back, when I arrived at a thought -- why
&gt;not put quick-disconnects on the wiring so I can take off the bumper
&gt;without cutting the wires?

Go for it!  You might use the fully-insulated 0.25&quot; tab disconnects -
these are fairly well shielded from the elements.  Amp or 3M are good
brands - Wal-Mart sells assortments of 3M connectors.  If you look around
you may be able to find insulated bullet connectors - these were a
favorite of older car stereo manufacturers.  The advantage to these
is that the connector is round and might just fit through the wire
hole in the body.

Another thing that might work is a trailer light connector.  The usual
4-wire flat one is overkill for this application; you can usually find
a 2-wire flat one that will work just fine.  If you're good you may
even be able to cut the rubber or vinyl housing down the middle of
the 2-wire coupler so you only have to buy one.  :)

For really good weatherproof connectors, take a pair of wire cutters
to your friendly local Army motor pool.  At least on their older
trucks, they used &quot;bullet&quot; connectors (hmm) with machined (not stamped)
terminals.  Also, each connector had a rubber hood over it that sealed
tightly to the hood on its mate.  In case they are uptight about you
borrowing their truck parts, you might try faking a rubber cover with
something like the seals that go on the ends of the heater box cables.
Slip one of these over the wire before you crimp the terminal on, then
slide it up to cover the terminal.

Good luck!
