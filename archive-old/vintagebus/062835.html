Subject: RE: [VB] mexican vw engines

 There are 5 different NEW engines out there for sale.
1. Beetlemex and others now, It is a beetle engine built for the old style
beetles
2. Beetlemex 2# same engine, designed for fuel injection with hydraylic
lifters
3. VW Brazil, these are good but with dedicated heads, pistons and
cylinders. Use the same block as the Brazil/Mexi block
4. Meican long block, built for the VW replacement engine market
5. SCAT long blocks. they use all there own manufactured parts. The block is
the Brazil/Brazil and the heads are AutoLinia (they make the new aluminum
blocks, CB and Empi heads).

I could write a book on all the research I have done on all the NEW VW
engines out there
I have long term results on 3 of them

the choice is yours

ronnie
