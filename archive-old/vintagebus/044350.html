Subject: vibrations in 3rd and 4th

1959 Kombi, big nut transaxle, 1600cc DP engine with 3000 miles on it.

This problem just started. When I'm low in gear, mainly 3rd and 4th, 
I'm getting a vibration throughout the bus. Wasn't there before. 
seems to happen up to about 2300 RPMS. Seems to be shifting fine. No 
changes in clutch action. Doesn't feel like slipping....just 
vibrating. It also seems to be not there if I'm going downhill or the 
bus isn't working as hard. Uphill...more vibrating. Engine is fine 
when in neutral and no vibrating when the bus is rolling in neutral. 
I'm gonna climb under the bus and make sure my engine bolts are 
tight. Any other suggestions before the engine gets pulled? Maybe I'm 
on the totally wrong path or something.
