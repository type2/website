&gt;Its called Durasheath or Rmax and is carried by Home Depot.  They have a
&gt;bunch of
&gt;different thicknesses as well.
&gt;A link to look at the stuff is: http://www.rmaxinc_dot_com/products/p7.html
&gt;

This isn't the stuff I've been using. The R-matte is what I've used. The
Durasheath doesn't have the foil faces, it uses a permeable fiber designed
to let the surface breath a little. Not a good vapor barrier. Both the
R-matte and Thermasheath have foil linings and provide a solid vapor
barrier. Info on these can be found at
http://www.rmaxinc_dot_com/products/index.html#5 The foil linings when combined
with properly foil taped edges and seams provides a good vapor barrier, ease
of handling, and good insulation. It's own flammability would be secondary,
and would be limited by the foil. The ignition source-whether fuel or
electrical, and whether it is still present would be primary. If the wood
panels that would presumably cover the insulation ignited, the method of
insulation behind them would cease to be an issue and it would be all about
weenies and marshmallows from that point on.
