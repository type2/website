&gt;if Kelley park gets bigger, they may well decide only split and oval window
&gt;bugs, and 1967 and earlier buses, like the european vintage shows.  THough
I
&gt;m am sure  it would include the SA '75 splitty.

FWIW, I am a member of the South African Historic Volkswagen Association
(what a mouthful), a group of vintage hardliners much after my own heart.
Association is open to stock or coachbuilt VWs built before August 1967.
They're really strict about the cut-off date, and all my split buses are
accepted except for the 75s ...
