Subject: Re: [VB] five buses
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Got the 59 singlecab out front with the Chevy pickup and van, got a 57
singlecab and a 61 Kombi in the sideyard plus the roof off a 61 and the nose
off a 65. Got the Westfailure in back hooked to the Airstream, plus the 62
subhatch raffle bus, a 71 deluxe and the roofs off a 68 poptop Westy and a
67 hardtop Deluxe from the beltline up, a Kubota and the 57 Oval and two
Corvettes in the garage-one old, one newer. Always room for a few more for
an overnight campout, makes it kind of cozy.
