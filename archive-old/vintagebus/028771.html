Well, my mistake was responding to a post that didn't have a question. I
thought there was a question there, but I guess there wasn't. Evidently,
Karl just wanted to vent because he spent the day out in the sun and he
got a lousy part.

Karl, if you just want to vent, please tell us, so we won't waste any
time responding. If you want help, then give us more details, and spare
us the hostility. Nobody needs that.

Have a nice day.
