Hello all!

I found another translation site, which might help those of you
with German manuals, literature, etc.  It's called EuroDicAutom
and the URL is http://eurodic.ip.lu/cgi-bin/edicbin/EuroDicWWW.pl .
It won't do complete documents like Babelfish, but it will give
you *choices*, extracted from real documents, on what a particular
word or phrase means.  As an example, it didn't give me a direct
hit for a word from M 108, 'Seitenfensterscheiben', but by playing
with it I was able to get a closer match than Babelfish would give
me.

Their own &quot;about&quot; is:

WHAT IS EURODICAUTOM? 

Eurodicautom is the multilingual terminological database of the 
European Commission's Translation Service.  Initially developed to
assist in-house translators, it is today consulted by an increasing
number of other EU officials, as well as by language professionals
throughout the world thanks to the MLIS-Project (Multilingual
Information Society) monitored by DGXIII. 

The information it contains is drafted in twelve languages and is
constantly updated. It covers a broad spectrum of human knowledge,
although the core relates to European Union topics. Feedback is
welcome and will be handled by terminologists, according to languages
and domains, or by the technical staff.
