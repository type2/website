But... be aware.  The penalties for doing such (and getting caught) are quite
severe.  Seems that there's a few federal statutes dating from the late
seventies (here in the US of A) against falsifying the mileage of a vehicle.
(Mine you, I didn't catch the original post, so there may be a perfectly
legitimate reason for resetting the speedo.)  BTW, you COULD take it apart and
pull the odometer shaft from the speedo and roll it to where ever you want. 
Old odo's are easy.  the new ones are a bit trickier.

YMMV
