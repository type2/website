&lt;&lt; Will be installing curtains in our 63 Kombi and were wondering if anyone

 an idea of how to hang them, ie., what can we use as curtain rods? &gt;&gt;

Hey Stuart, I've got an idea for you. Go to a junk yard and get some curtain 
rods out of a late model Westy. You can cut and bend them to look like the 
old style if you can't find the real thing. Janet
