&gt; I was given a single wheel trailer recently.  It didn't have a bed or
&gt; box just the frame. Can anyone give me any info on it?  What type of box
&gt; it should have had?  It is marked with &quot;trail car&quot; or &quot;trailer car&quot;.
&gt; Here are some pictures.

That appears to be an early to mid '50s &quot;Allstate&quot; trailer frame.  These
trailers were made for and sold by Sears &amp; Roebuck Co. from the late '40s
thru the late '60s both as complete trailers and kits... price ran from $12
for base wheel kit to $60 for complete trailer with canvas cover.

Anyplace that has old Sears catalogs on microfilm( I know Dartmouth college
has a set on microfilm, Sears Co. archivist told us that...) can show you
these rigs...
    My buddy has one fairly complete trailer with a steel body and a later
frame and wheel assembly.  He paid $250 for the complete trailer (swapped a
new utility trailer to the painting contractor who had it hooked to his ford
pickup) and $60 for the frame/wheel assembly.

The big thing when using these on a Bug or KG is to be aware that they put a
heck of a strain on the bumper brackets when hauling any kind of weight in
the trailer.  My buddy has broken 2-3 brackets on his '70 Beetle even with as
little as 150# in it...  These weren't meant just for VWs (altho they were
really ideal for them), and on the huge Detroit iron of the times the bumper
hardware was substantially heavier duty...

Neat period accessory...
