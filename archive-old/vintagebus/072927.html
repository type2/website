Subject: re:got it(shock mount)

Was writ:
&quot; I drove it over to a body shop and they can straighten out and re-weld my
rear upper shock mount for me for 60 bucks at the most.&quot;

My friend has a similar problem, but with her '69 bug, and it is the front
shock mount, I guess it rusted through, so a very rough ride up front...do
you guys know if this is something that can be welded back on, or do you
need to replace that whole thing?

I must admit I haven't looked at it, she just brought it to a mechanic when
she had the problems, and that is what he discovered...

Thanks
