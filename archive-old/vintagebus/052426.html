Subject: Roof Ladder Rubber End Cap Needed

List:

I have 3 of the 4 rubber end caps that go on the four legs of a folding roofrack ladder.  Any chance someone has a spare rubber end cap they'd like to sell?  Otherwise I guess I'll have to crack and buy 4 generic ones at the hardware store.  Geez, it even hurts to type that, let alone do it.

TIA.

Robert
