Someone recently asked a question regarding the long wood panel that should
install along the driver's side of the cargo area of a Westy splittie... My
email software has been iffy as of late so here is my delayed input.

The discussion was related to keeping the wood grain in a vertical direction
and spaning the width which exceeds the five foot (5') span of the five by
five Baltic Birch panels. I too stumbled on this point and eventually
spliced at the forward edge of the smallish arm rest of the forward facing
rear bench/Z-bed unit. If the five foot span is started at the corner just
behind the bench divider &lt;forward most point in the cargo area&gt; then the
width of the wood sheet will extend behind the armrest. Add another panel
&gt;from that point toward the rear of the bus to the obvious point over the
interior rear wheel well. Only a few inches &lt;one or two&gt; will be exposed
above the arnrest at the point where the two pieces meet. Do your best to
match the edges. Look on the non-exposed or &quot;backside&quot; of the splice to see
where supporting wooden blocks might be glued and/or stapled into place. I
personally did my best and then used a matching putty stick to try to hide
the seam.

I know that there are craftsmen &lt;craftspersons&gt; on this list who are far
superior to my wood working skill level. Be a perfectionist and try to
please yourself. The ficticious vintage Nazis wont give a darn in the long
run. You have to live with the results- they dont. Have fun and use your bus
once its completed.

BTW: I lost my beloved Eudora upon installing FrontPage 98. FP98 insisted on
loading a &quot;Personal Web Server&quot;. That horked up things. Now it looks like
I'm stuck with Outlook Express until I get the time to uninstall the POS
Microsoft poop and reinstall Eudora.
