&lt;&lt; Hi list,
 
 Question number two for the day. Do the rear brake flex lines on a '60 bus
 have a bug counterpart. I seem to remember that they were the same as those
 from a seventies bug from the last replacement years ago.
  &gt;&gt;
I am not sure what you are asking

1.   yes bugs also have rear flex lines

2.      the p/n is 113 611 775 for the rear brake hoses (length 270mm) so yes 
this part is also used on a bug
