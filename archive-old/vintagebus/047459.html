&lt;&lt; Is the Nosecone in a small nut tranny the same as in the big nut tranny?
 How about the Hockey Stick? Are they interchangable from small nut to big
 nut?
 thanks in advance
 John
  &gt;&gt;
they were the same for tunnel case tranny buses may 59 through 67 model.   no 
change there when they did the big nut small nut deal.  Bugs are different.   
a tunnel case trans nose cone will not fit a split case trans, nope cant do 
it.
