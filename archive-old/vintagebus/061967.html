Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Leak at Fuel Tap

Installing the fuel tap poses some interesting issues.  the tank is threaded, 
the tap is threaded, but there is a double threaded collar that connects the 
two.  You hold the tap stationary and tighten the collar which threads on to 
both the tap and the tank.  but it seemed to me that the collar had to be 
threaded onto the tap the right amount before attaching to the tank.  not too 
much, not too little, but just right.

There is that seal you mentioned, there is also an internal seal on the tap, 
but if it is new it should be good.  I rebuildt the  fuel tap for my 61 with 
the rebuild kit from WW and was very happy.  

I'd get a flashlight and see if you can tell if the leak is where the tap 
joins the tank, or from tap itself.  If the former, try adjusting how you put 
it on.  Hope this makes sense.

To anyone else, I'd replace the tap when I had the motor out, if possible.  
And make sure there are no leaks before installing motor.

&lt;&lt; I've got a slow leak at my fuel tap. Aside from the internal fuel filter 
 seal, is there any other seal that is supposed to be there? Also, is there a 
 right and wrong way to screw on the tap itself? I was kinda confused which 
 thing to tighten first, the part that screws inside the tank or the collar 
 that tightens over the outside. Oh, this is a new German tap w/reserve level 
 that I got from WW.
