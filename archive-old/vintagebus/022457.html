Subject: Reduction Box Bearings, small nut drums...
Mime-Version: 1.0

	
I tore into the passenger side reduction box today.  Looks like my only
real problem is a bad seal - the bearings themselves are really nice and
tight, almost as nice as the new ones!  I think I'll leave them be, unless
anyone can give me a good reason to replace them.

I'm going to put in new brakes at the same time, which is new shoes, wheel
cylinders, and rubber lines.  The existing wheel cylinders and lines have
50k+ miles one them...		

Does anyone have a source for new small-nut drums (pre-64) mine are
*really* warn, and the local VW Flaps can't get them.
