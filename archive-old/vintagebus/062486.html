Subject: turnsignals

Do the turn signal lights on a 66 bus come on when you engage your parking
lights or headlights? Or do they only come on when you engage your turning
signals left or right or when you run your emergency flashing? Dumb question
I know... but I wasn't born yet when those dang buses were cranking down the
roadways.


Oh...one more inquiry. My turn signals don't have a ground lead. I guess
their grounded to the front panel?
