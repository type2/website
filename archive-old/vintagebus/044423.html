Subject: Re: [VB] difference between middle seat bay and split ??
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey that is interesting! When was your 67 built? Mine is dated 
6.20.67. Wonder is there was a mid year change. BTW, my middle seat 
is original to the bus.

&gt;... beg to differ concerning the holes in the rails for a '67 (not that that
&gt;trivia is going to change the world &lt;&lt;grin&gt;&gt;)
&gt;The (original) middle seat on my '67 does not have holes in the rails.
&gt;There is a clip that connects to the nub and bolts over the top of the rail;
&gt;there are eight of them total.  I know this to be a fact as just this AM I
&gt;pulled the middle seat out of the bus so I can haul an RV generator to the
&gt;loal repair shop tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1967 (one year onlyish ) has holes in the rails for the nubs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;There's differences, but a bay seat will _fit_ in a split.  The bay seats
&gt;also
&gt;&gt;  &gt;use the seat clamps with nubs on them as opposed to the split kind, which
&gt;are
&gt;&gt;  &gt;smooth.  The nubs go into holes on the seat legs.
&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;
