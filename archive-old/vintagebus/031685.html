Ask VW H#_at_%ARD, Dave B#$ns, Jim Be%$#_at_e about SVDA, 3 different engines in 3
different buses and none of them could make it work. It is now an ornament.
Useing the SVDA had great bottom up to about 3000 RPM where it feel on it's
face. No matter where the timing was it just didn't perform at RPM'S. Fuel
economy suffered in all buses. It might have been a defective one, who
knows. I use the same style dizzy in my wifes 65 beetle, New Factory 1600
with 34 pict 3 without a problem. The one I used though is out of a 74 type
1 (1 year only)and am not completley happy with the performance. I will go
back to an 009 with a compufire ignition, rejet the carb and drive it,or I
might get fancy and put in a 019 dizzy.

I bought one of those SVDA distributors from aircooled_dot_net and installed it
on my westy last night.  This engine is a 1600 *single* port with a recent
carb, and until lately I 
was using the dreaded 009.

I got stumped putting it in at first.  For one thing, the alignment tab on
the cap (fits into square notch on top rim of distributor body) was 180
degrees different on the 
SVDA than the 009.  No problem, just unplugged the wires and rotated the cap
180 degrees.

Then got it all put together and tried to fire it up.  No go.  Fiddled with
it for a while, comparing it to the 009, and made a strange discovery: the
rotor position is 90 
degrees different.  Imagine yourself standing behind the engine looking down
at the top of the dizzy.  When engine is at #1 TDC (confirmed by pulley
notch, dizzy drive 
slot, and valves) on the 009, rotor points to about 4 o'clock, as shown in
many of the manuals.  At same engine position, the SVDA points to about 2
o'clock, which was 
where my #2 plug wire was.  (I also have a 71 DP dizzy - 205Q - that points
to 2 o'clock at #1 TDC).

The simple solution was to shift the plug wires 90 degrees around the cap.
Am I missing something?

Performance ain't that great yet (so far worse than the 009), but I don't
think I'm dialed in right.  I just set static timing, but need to set it for
full advance at 3xxx RPM (I 
think) to get it right, yes?
