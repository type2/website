Their $195 tranny must just be the center section and even at that I agree with Thom. Add up the price of the parts and if it comes out to more than the cost of the rebuild. Even if there is a warranty most of these places will get out of it one way or another.

A year and a half ago I had my trannny rebuilt in Portland. It started making a weird random clunk sound. The guy said it was my big engine that screwed it up and I was lucky to get 20,000 miles out of it. He charged me $100 bucks to fix one axle and to wait 500 miles and he would check something and then change the oil. I changed the oil anyway. Big metal chunks. Tranny started locking up while I was up for a show in Puyallup. New tranny time. I just spent $750 on this thing.

His big engine theory sucks because: I had a stock clutch, that I never slipped had stock 165 series tires that I never spun, and the motor was in the car when he built the tranny. It was never mentioned at that time that I would be lucky to get 20,000 miles from a tranny with that motor. Anyway the Tranny is at a reputable tranny builder in Seattle and I am another $750 poorer. But I will never work with this guy in Portland again. I guess I learned something from it.
