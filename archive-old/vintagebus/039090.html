Subject: Re: oil cooler mounting question
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 09:43:58 -0600

&gt;I want to upgrade my dog house cooler to the type 4 cooler.  What 
&gt;should I expect to pay for a cooler with adapter?  Can I get these 
&gt;new, or only used?  Thanks for any answers

I grudgingly paid $30 for a used type IV cooler.  But it had already
been cleaned and pressure tested for leaks.  You use the same
adapter/mount that your doghouse cooler attaches to, but the 2 longer
studs on the adapter need to be replaced with even longer ones (about
3/4&quot; longer) since the type IV cooler is thicker.  The rubber seals are
the same as the doghouse style seals.

BTW, I widened my doghouse shroud to fit the type IV cooler using
nothing but the big-hammer-and-lots-of-RTV-silicon method.  It is UGLY,
but it works.  I'll look for a new shroud sometime soon and do it
properly.  But the point is, it CAN be done with a BF hammer, 2 pieces
of 2x4, a piece of 3/8&quot; plywood, and an &quot;I don't give a rat's ass&quot;
attidude.  YMMV :-).
