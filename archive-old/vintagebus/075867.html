Subject: Adios Combi TV ad from Mexico

As you've probably heard, VW Mexico will stop manufacturing &quot;old&quot; 
beetles in a few weeks.

VW Mexico stopped manufacturing type2 busses in 2001. The last few 
years of production were actually bay window water cooled busses (see 
the radiator on http://www.paulDotTrip_dot_com/vw_bus/combi_mexico.jpg) 
but they were pretty much the same &quot;loaf of bread&quot; we all love.

While in Mexico I came across the ad that VW was going to run when 
the &quot;Combi&quot; (as they call it) was retired in 2001.

Enjoy.

It is a 2.5MB Quicktime movie.  If you don't have Quicktime, you can 
download it for free from http://www.apple_dot_com/quicktime/download/


P.S. Splitty owners will appreciate this ad too!
