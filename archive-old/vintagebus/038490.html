&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Actually,
&gt;&gt; what I need is a giant garage with attached house.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Or maybe just a sleeping loft inside the garage. That would leave more space
&gt;&gt; for a larger shop. ahhh yes thats the ticket.

I went to look at a bus for sale last year. The seller lived on some acrage
that was part of someones farm. He lived in a very small but neat moble
home. Next to the trailer was a 4 car shop neatly organized, clean, and well
stocked with tools. The gravel parking lot outside the shop was raked and
edged quite well.  The shop was about 3 times the sive of his mobile home
and I could not help bus comment that he seemed to have his priorities
straight:) I was quite pleased to agree!
