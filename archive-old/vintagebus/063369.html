&gt;well i got a little over excited that i worked on bus becouse i havent
&gt;touched it in so long i forgot to refill the motor with oil.

If the engine was cold before you started it, and it was only idling,
it might be OK.  Put some oil in it and make your next oil change at
a half or a third of the normal interval, to get any burnt-up oil
out of the engine.

You didn't make the engine any better than it was, but you probably
didn't hurt it much.  My grandmother once had the oil changed on her
'74 Bug at the dealer, and when she started it up in the parking lot,
the oil light stayed on.  She drove it back around to the service
entrace and shut it off.  They had forgot to refill it with oil. 
That was with less than 20k miles on the engine.  It's now around
15 years later and that engine has 60k+ on it with no obvious signs
of damage.

Is your oil light not working?  I would notice it pretty quick if
one of the lights stayed on in the speedometer after I started
the engine.  Make sure your oil light works.
