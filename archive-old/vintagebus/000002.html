&lt;&lt; i am new to the type 2's what kind of grease or oil do i need to put into 
my 
 reduction boxes?and what is to fast to travel on the highway with a 1600 
 dualport engine with a stock trans and reduction gears?i do alot of highway 
 driving and i really dont want to ruin my trans or reduction gear boxes so i 
 would like to know what is a good comfortable speed would be.thanx for 
 everyones help.

use 80/90 wt gear oil.   change reduction gear boxes and center section at 
the same time., they are all connected.  Clean the magnetic plugs.   Put the 
plugs back in the center first, and fill the boxes, last fill the center 
section.  Before filling, check you axle boots, and replace them if they are 
cracked or torn.

usually I say keep it not above 55-60, but that depends on your particular 
gearing, which may, or may not, be what came on it originally, the bus is 
old, and you dont say what year either (?).  Look at the rear axle nuts- the 
ones that are 36mm have 1.39 reductions, the 46mm nut boxes have 1.26 
reduction gears (99.99% of the time), meaning the big nut buses are geared to 
go faster than the little nut ones.   You also have a ring &amp; pinion of 
unknown ratio in there, and unknown what 4th you have (bus 4th is .82, but 
bug four6th- lower at .89- have been found in buses) bottom line is get a 
tach on it, and see where 3K rpms is, use that as your cruising speed.   I 
had a 59 truck with little nuts and probably a 4.37 R&amp;P, and It liked 
cruising about 52-53  mph max, though I could push it to 60 it didn't like 
it, so I didn't.   I was slow, but it was a 40 year old truck, designed not 
for the autobahn, but local work.    I can deal with being passed by 
everyone.   Some people can't, and  will tell you to drive flat out, but that 
leads to overrevving IMOPBEO.
