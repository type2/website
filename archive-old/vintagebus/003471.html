yeah bosch no longer rebuilds or manufactures the sr17 ....&quot;Duralast&quot; does.
You can get them still at any any Autozone....the number for them in their
computer is &quot;16300 import starter&quot;...still say bosch on them :)

&gt;&gt; or go buy an automatic starter for a autostick beetle  and say F*Ck the
&gt;&gt; Bushing.  and have more torque to TuRn that low compression 40hp over.
&gt;&gt; thats what i did.  be smart don't be a ReTard!

&gt;Bosch is no longer rebuilding ( nor making new) the sr-17x &quot;automatic&quot;
&gt;starter, so this may not be an option for long.
