The POR-15 people sell a great fuel tank repair kit for about $50.  It
was the first thing I did to my DC, after the PO had kept it garaged for
many years.  The kit has all you need to prep and seal the tank, once
you've cleaned out all the gunk.  (Be sure to try some careful taps with
a ball peen hammer also, just to make sure you've loosened all the
chunks of crud.)  The kit even includes some fuel stabilizer additive
for good measure.

&gt; I'm considering sealing the tank.  Considering because the FLAPS people looked
&gt; at me like I was crazy when I started talking about fuel tanks and making broad
&gt; sloshing gestures with my arms.  If I would have found something, I would have
&gt; hauled off and just done it...but it looks like I have to mail order whatever
&gt; I use, if I decide to do it.  I'm looking for some input, like what I might use
&gt; to seal the tank, or maybe if I should even bother with it at all.
