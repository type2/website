Steve,
  Judging by the pictures, isn't this what they call &quot;rust free&quot; on the east
coast? More pictures of the frame and interior floor would be most helpful.
The answer to your question is still &quot;it depends&quot;. It looks fairly complete
and restorable to me (depends on the condition of the aforementioned items).
Not a small project, but not Thom's barndoor either. It is definitely worthy
of rescue, even if you decide not to keep it.
