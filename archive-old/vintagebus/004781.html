Sometimes an idea is just too good to pass up.  Of course, you may not know
you like something unless someone else turns you on to it!  There are so
many things and experiences in this trip we call life, and so many different
ways and angles from which to look at the limitless aspects of the same
thing, that no-one can ever really be called &quot;wrong&quot;.  Anyone who labels
another character as &quot;improper&quot; or &quot;shallow&quot; or any other such adjective is
not seeing the forest.....

And having worked with many celebrities, and having found that they are just
like each and every one of us, there is no reason to try to deny them the
right to enjoy the same idols that form the focus of our kooky religion.
(At least mine!).  I've worked with Sammy Hagar, Mickey Hart, Tom Waits,
Michelle Shocked, the guys from Primus (Rhinoplasty), etc, and all these
people are as unique and diversive in their interests as everyone else I
know (of).

It must really s*ck being a celebrity!

And for every bus that gets a good home, whether it be professionally
restored or fresh from the junkyard or field of weeds, whether it be
consigned to the purgatory of a showroom or let loose on the roads, I
rejoice.

So there.

Gene
