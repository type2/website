Subject: RE: [VB] Alan Schofield

&gt; Alan Schofield?
&gt; 
&gt; who sells shis stuff in America now, i tried to call, locate 
&gt; any info on the Das BUlli Haus, and web links point to 
&gt; nothing, and phone number is a machine, with no-one calling back.

 
We stock some Schofield stuff, and can get the rest.  Most of the
Schofield parts can be identified on busdepot_dot_com by doing a part number
search for AHS, as that is the prefix we use on most of them. It is
worth noting that not all of Schofield's metal is different from
everyone else's. For every part that he makes, there is another that he
just buys and resells. Of course, the ones we list as AHS are ones that
he actually makes.
