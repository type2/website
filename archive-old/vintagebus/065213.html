Subject: Difference between 211 and 311 bearing retainers?

What is the difference between type2 and type3 rear wheel bearing 
retainers?  I'm talking about the piece with 4 bolts that goes
over the end of the axles and contains the rear wheel seal and
covers the bearing.

The 311 I have looks almost identical to the 211 I have, except
for a channel for an O-ring on the 311, where the O-ring would
go on the outer perimeter of the bearing.
