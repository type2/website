the tranny is standard I was going 60 not over so should be ok.&gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
Never assume, you know what happens when you do that!  Our 1960 panel camper 
came with a DP engine with a rod through the top of the engine case.  We 
built up a nice big bore 40HP engine and could not get the bus over 45 MPH on 
the flats pedal to the metal.  Turned out it was doing 3,000 RPM at 35 MPH 
and 4,000 RPM at 4,000 RPM.  Traded for a used tranny that a friend said he 
and his brother drove at 55 no problem!  Turned out that one did the early 
stock 1960-63 47 MPH at 3,000 RPM and 55 at 3,800 RPM!  If you had a 4.125 
R&amp;P with .82 fourth and late RGBs you should be able to do 55 MPH at 3,000 
RPM.  So unless you have a freeway flier 3.875 R&amp;P .82 fourth with late RGB 
which would get you 60 MPH at 3,000.......  so far Clara is the only person 
who seems to be able to RPM an engine at 3,000 RPM in fourth gear by ear.  
Everyone else we have helped tach out, including us have had sheepish 
embarrassed grins on after finding out what RPMs in the higher gears to MPH 
really are!
 
 &gt;Check you fan width which must be at least 33mm (35mm is better.) inside
 &gt;measurement and the lower pulley a 2:1 ratio both especially a must for use
 &gt;with doghouse shroud!
 
 Looks ok.&gt;&gt;

Do not look, measure.
 
&lt;&lt;Check for relief and regulator spring proper lengths.
 Long length high pressure relief.&gt;&gt;

Beware using that spring up here!  Can easily cause way excessive oil 
pressure especially in cooler weather.
 
 &lt;&lt;Modified carb for engine, runs a bit rich,&gt;&gt;

You might want to have a sniffer test of the exhaust to make sure the carb is 
running it a bit rich at all RPMs you use.
 
&lt;&lt; Seals in place, tin in place. Put extra effort in getting good insulation 
around dog house.&gt;&gt;

Good!
 
&lt;&lt; Flaps good, no thermostat.&gt;&gt;

That will work for now.
 
&lt;&lt; Would like a type 4 cooler, have one on hand. You guys still making the 
 modification? &gt;&gt;

Yes, we have some in storage.  Could dig a complete setup out for you next 
week.
