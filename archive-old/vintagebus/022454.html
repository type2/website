Subject: Working on the '56 - trans/redux boxes
Mime-Version: 1.0


I finally got the garage cleaned up enough to be able to get the '56 in to
work on it.  It needed a trans input seal (blew out on the way to the
Vallejo show) and new pushrod seals.

I figure while I'm at it, I'll fix the reduction box problems.  The
driver's side rear wheel has been a little wobbly, and the box is leaking.

I have new seals and bearings; will I need &quot;the plug,&quot; and if so, where do
I get it and what's involved in putting it in?  It's been a long time since
I've removed these gears and bearings, like 5 years or so!
