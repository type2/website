Subject: Attaching bed slats with screws

This does sound like a good idea and I might suggest something that may
work even better.  Around the rural areas, we are building large metal
barns that have a wooden frame.  In order to attach the metal to the frame
we use a hex headed metal screw that has a drill bit tip and on it's head a
rubber washer.  Using a cordless screw driver, we drive this into the sheet
metal and they drill their own hole through the metal and into the wood.
The rubber washer seals the screw (there is a shoulder on the screw head
that acts as a washer) against the sheet metal.  These screws do have a
powder coating on them so they won't rust.

You can find these screws with the self drilling tip and rubber sealing
washer at most well stocked lumber yards.


&gt;These were actually #12 sheet metal screws with hexhead tops so I could
&gt;tighten them down (from underneath) with a mini socket wrench.  They
&gt;held quite well in this wood.  By pre-drilling, I meant that I drilled
&gt;smaller-diameter guide holes into the undersides of the slats, to
&gt;prevent splitting the wood with the screws.  Hope that clears things up
&gt;for you.

&gt;&gt; Pan head?  Pan head machine screws?  Did you put inserts in the pre drilled
&gt;&gt; holes?  Am I thinking of something different?  Are the screws you used wood
&gt;&gt; screws?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Curious as I'll eventually splurge for slats for my working DC.

&gt;&gt; &gt; FWIW last year I installed my repro set of wood bedslats using #12
&gt;&gt; &gt; half-inch panhead screws from underneath.  The screw is a perfect size
&gt;&gt; &gt; and shape for the factory-drilled holes in the bed.  This leaves an
&gt;&gt; &gt; unbroken surface on top when viewing the result.  I carefully predrilled
&gt;&gt; &gt; screw holes in the underside of each slat using a drill stop.  Also used
&gt;&gt; &gt; snippets of bicycle innertube for sealing gaskets.  I know it's not
&gt;&gt; &gt; stock, but I think the unbroken look is nice, leaves no screwhead or
&gt;&gt; &gt; rivet hole edges for snags, and leaves the wood slats less susceptible
&gt;&gt; &gt; to breaking.
