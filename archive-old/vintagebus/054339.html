Subject: Next Question

I'm in the process of adding Safari Windows to my current '67 Camper
restoration.  I pulled my front windshields today, and was surprised to
see quite a bit of surface rust at the bottom of the channels where the
rubber holds the glass.  I put a wire brush into my drill motor and
cleaned it out the best that I could.  The surface on the bottom of
these channels is very rough and bumpy.  There are also a couple of
places that have rusted through, with the holes about as big as the end
of a pencil erasure.  My question is, should I have these channels
grinded down smooth, which will probably create some more small holes,
have the holes welded up and smoothed?  Or, can I simply apply body
filler over the entire area and sand it smooth.  I'd hate to have to cut
out the entire channels and have them replaced, especially since there
are only 3-4 small holes.  Does anyone know if the rust will keep on
deteriorating the metal, even if I primer and paint over it?  I don't
want to have to re-do this all in a couple of years, or even think about
it ever.

Thanks,
Ed
