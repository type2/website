Now for the required bus content...  Well, I don't have any questions other
than wanting to know the part number for the Barndoor rear reflectors.
&gt;
My '58 parts book lists it as N 18 500 2
Don't know what the heck that part # means (maybe N for North America for
replacements?  That would be 55-57, though...) but my original reflectors
are in this pic:

They should be big-diamond, with a black back, be made of glass and be real
heavy.  They probably say the following on the rim:
Frese ~~~~ K1282
