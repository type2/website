Subject: Re: [VB] Temp Question

That sounds a little high to me, but not massly excessively high.   I dunno 
your gearing, nor tire size, nor humidity, nor if your have a doghouse or if 
all the tin is there and all the seals are good and there or if you have a 
thermostat and fins.   Getting everything sealed up does REALLY improve your 
engine compartmnet pressurisation and thus cooling (and heater volume), but 
it really kicks in when you get the LAST seal, or piece, in place.   

Basically I wouldn't freak if you have stock 65 gearing- do you know what it 
is? maybe should find out, but if that was my bus I'd want it to run a bit 
cooler.

 I have a 65 bus running a basically stock DP1600.  Only non-stock items may 
be Bocar 34/3 carb (with a 137 main jet) and electronic ignition.  I have a 
temp guage connected to the rear pressure relief valve.
 
 My question is,  when I cruise down the HWY (55 +/- (mostly -)) temp on the 
guage goes up to maybe 210.  When I am idling or driving around town temp 
only hits 180+.  I realize that my guage may not be calibrated correctly, but 
my bus is obviously running cooler in stop/go traffic than on the freeway.
 
 These conditions were observed today, outside temp was about 78-80.
 
 Is this abnormal?  What could be the cause if it is?
