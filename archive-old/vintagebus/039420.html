Hello all,

To begin with, you might have seen my Doublecab at the OCTO show: two-tone 
grey and white primer parked next to Steve Harris's DC.

So, to my point, does anyone out there own or have access to a SC or DC with 
a semi decent bed?  Semi decent for me would be no holes larger than 1 or 2 
inches.  I apologize for the repeat request for my bed, but maybe someone'll 
have a lead for me.  I'm in Southern Calif and would be able to drive to 
Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and maybe New Mexico.

So if you have a bashed in SC or DC you're wanting to get rid of,  please 
let me know.  I'll buy the whole vehicle if need be.

Thanks,

Alex
