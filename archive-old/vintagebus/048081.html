Hi Dworkin,
We did a simular setup on our 1960 panel with small vintage yellow glass 
lensed bullet style trailer lights on the license plate frame for auxillary 
turn/brake siganls.  Years and years later, way over 100,000 miles and 16 
differant Western States with no problems with the law!  plus lots less 
problems with fellow drivers not seeing our signals even during the daytime.
