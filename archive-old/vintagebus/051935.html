5/8&quot; for those who use standard tools on their metric vehicles, 8mm for the
others. i've used both and they both seem to wotk just fine.
sometimes if the grub screw has been boogered up it's difficult to get the
square socket on. there is also a double square (referred to by some as a
weird looking star socket). it it not a 12 pt, but 2 overlapping squares.
there is also an original vw/hazet tool with a &quot;T&quot; handle and an 8mm
square. they were available in 2 different lengths.
be careful when tightening the new grub screw in the new coupler. some of
the new couplers are cheaply made and any excessive torque on the grub
screw will cause the threads in the coupler to strip out.
also, if your old grub screws (original ones) are good, re-use them. some
of the new grub screws tips (the pointy parts) are not the same as
originals and do not engage as deeply as original ones. they (the new ones)
are stubbier.

&gt; There was a post fairly recently stating that you could get the correct
size 
&gt; square socket at sear although I don't recall the size.
