Subject: YET another double door!
Date: Wed, 23 Feb 2000 13:49:18 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Kerry from New Mexico came through Havasu yesterday on his way back to New
Mexico from Oakland, Cal. with his newly aquired 1962 Double Door
Walkthrough panel, it was a very clean bus and puts another double door in
the books, it seems that double doors are starting to become popular or
thats all thats left out there in good condition anymore. I have 1, VWhoward
has 1 and just sold his other 1, Kerry, Thom, Johnney S, Mike and the list
goes on, will make a great picture at the Classic if we all show up (hint
hint Thom) there together, maybe Thom will be in another mag shot!

Anyway the strange thing in Kerrys walkthrough was the way the drivers seat
was mounted, it had stock slider mounts on the outside of the pedestal and
on the walkthrough side it had a bolt on bracket with the seat adjuster
built into it. I have never noticed a movable seat in a 62 before (or i
never paid any attention), but this was a really cool set-up. Kerry said
that he will either post some photo's of it, or send some to me to post.

PSS, a friend of mine who owns a 21 window deluxe, was wondering where the
water drains to from his sunroof.
