Gentlepersons-
                       A good source for gaskets, etc. is Metro Molded Parts, 
Inc. The web
site is &lt;http://www.metrommp_dot_com&gt; and the phone # is 1-800-878-2237. The cat-
alog is very extensive (although loaded towards 'merican iron), and they have 
lots of
stock sized sheets, grommets, etc. The catalog also has full-sized profiles, 
so some-
thing can usually be cobbled up with a little ingenuity. The products 
themselves are
first rate, and usually better made than some of the OEM stuff I've gotten 
replaced.
They were most helpful, even on the phone, when I was looking for a seal 
between the
chassis and frame on my Morgan rebuild. I've used them as a source for 
replacement
rubber grommets and seals on a couple of VW transplants and project cars.
