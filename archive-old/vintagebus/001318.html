Subject: Estimate of '67 Camper..Now it's time to say goodbye...

    I am finally selling the '67 Camper. I got a newer (real new, but no
character) van from a friend which is much safer on my weekly road trips and
has A/C.  The Camper has gotten me all over California. I was thinking about
keeping it, but I just can't really have two vehicles. That's a luxury not
available to me now.

    So it's sad.....but I really need some help with a sale price. I feel
all misty eyed (boo hoo).  Here is the just of the 1967 Westfalia Pop-top
Camper.  Now that I've fixed it up, it runs great.  It has a whole new front
end, new clutch, new transmission, new brakes, low miles on newer engine.
The body has very little rust, a few minor dings, there is no paint job. The
Bus is primer. Should I paint it or would the new owner want to paint it?

    Interior, in my iopinion, is in fairly good shape.  Wood not cracked or
anything. There is an icebox. No canvas for the pop-top and the right hand
windshield has a crack.  That's about it.  I've driven it all around
Northern California and it has a lot of get up and go.

    If anyone has an estimate it would really help. It's really appreciates
for I have NO CLUE. When I went to research at the library it was really no
help.

Thanks a lot. Oh, there are no reduction boxes-don't know if that's good or
bad??
