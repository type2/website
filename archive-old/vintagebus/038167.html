 361
 UP 265 BLUE
 
 So, it was sent to Portland OR USA, it is a LHD Right side double cab
 painted blue (dove blue) but what is the 361????
 
 Also, the shifter is close to the front seat so is it a split or tunnel
 transaxle... how can I tell from the outside?  I'll crawl under it tonight
 and look for some adapter plate.
  &gt;&gt;
I believe 361 is a package code for US specs

the hand levers were close to the front seat till about ch #501 000, not an 
exact science to define splitcase/tunnel case, which change was earlier
