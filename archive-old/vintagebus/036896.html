&lt;&lt; Hi all,
 I am spending a couple of weeks in Argentina, and have contacted a local VW 
 &quot;guru&quot;, who has piles and piles of vintage parts. Can anyone give me a 
general 
 idea of the cost of the following items? 
 -'48 (according to him) bus steering wheel in very good shape.
 -'VERY early Blaupunkt radio, with two big buttons and a separate amplifier 
 box, in decent shape
 -steering lock mechanism for early bus, with key.
 -NOS front and rear bumpers (european, no over riders)
 
 There are also hundreds of early bug parts. Let me know if anyone is looking 
 for a hard to find bug part.
 Any help is appreciated.
 I've been invited to have dinner with the largest local VW club on Tue.
 Hope all you wetwestians had a great time at Puyallup, see you soon.

I'd like to see that one.
