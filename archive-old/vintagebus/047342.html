&lt;&lt; When I take of my cap I have to hold the reservoir  container body or it

this bad and will it let air into the brake system? &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Yup!  You need to install or tighten the locking nut at the base of the 
resovior if yours is an early threaded in model.  Better yet just change to 
the 1972 and later dual MC so you can have at least half of your brakes if a 
wheel/slave cylinder, metal or flex line blows out.  Check the type2 library 
for the instructions we wrote up.
