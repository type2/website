&gt; But it still had that oxidezed surface rust thing going on. I got a gallon

&gt; dried the metal and primered it as fast as I could. It was hectic, but

Hi Rex,
Best not to use water to rinse off the phosperic acid.  Doing so just starts 
the rust all over again! BTDT and now have to remove the paint inside the 
roof of the 1960 panel camper conversion to remove the rust that is now 
slowly appearing.  Thank goodness we primered with zink rich primer or it 
would be moving far faster.  Either just let the phosperic acid dry and then 
sand lightly or use a body shop degreaser that does not have water in it.
