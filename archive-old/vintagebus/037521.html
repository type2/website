Speaking of radio's. Does anyone have any of the old 4-track tapes? I've got 
one of the radio's with the 4 track but no tapes. I did see a guy at Seattle, 
WA a few years back with some. He would not part with just one of the 30 tapes 
he had. Package deal only, with a 4-track player. I didn't need another player 
so I passed.

Rick
