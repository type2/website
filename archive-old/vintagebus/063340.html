&gt;Will work on getting a VOM on it to see how accurate everything is.

Keep in mind that your VOM accuracy affects this too.  Rat Shock's
$25 DMM has a DC accuracy of +/- 2.0% of reading, +/- 0.2% of full
scale, +/- 1 in last digit.  Their $90 DMM has a DC accuracy of
+/- 1%, +/- 2 digits on the 40 V scale.  The two VOMs they sell
have a DC accuracy of +/- 3% of full scale.

If your tools say things like &quot;Snap-on&quot; on them, go get a Fluke
digital multimeter.  Their model 77 has an 0.3% DC accuracy.  It
costs $200 but you will have it forever.  If you prefer analog
meters, get a Simpson 260 for about the same money, with a 2% of
full scale DC accuracy.

&gt;I believe I have 10W40 in there now.  I know. I know.  Single
&gt;weight only is recommended.

Let us read.

The Book of &quot;Lubrication and Maintenance&quot;, Chapter 1, Page 1,
verses 6 through 8:

6 It is important to use lubricants of well-known brands which are
in accordance with the specifications laid down by the Volkswagenwerk.
7 These specifications are known to all the major mineral oil firms
and make it possible to produce the lubricants to the specifications
and check the products when necessary.
8 In view of the world-wide distribution of the Volkswagen it is
obvious that these specifications cover all possible climactic
conditions from arctic cold to tropical heat.

Chapter 2, Page 2, verses 7 and 8:

7 Years of experience with millions of VW engines all over the world
has shown clearly that single grade oils of the correct viscosity are
satisfactory for the VW engine under all operating conditions.
8 These oils have proved themselves by reason of long trouble-free
life and by low consumption.

Chapter 2, Page 9, verse 1:

1 Viscosity SAE 30  Type 2/1200 above 30=B0C (86=B0F)
Type 2/1500 above 0=B0C (32=B0F)

Chapter 2, Page 2, verse 1 (as revised in August 1966):

1 Viscosity SAE 30  Type 2/1200 and 2/1500  In the warmer seasons

Thus ends the reading.

&gt;I went through my parts stash last night and found a new oil pump,
&gt;still in bag, which leads me to think I didn't put a new one in last
&gt;fall when I rebuilt the engine.

If the heavier oil doesn't get it, put it in there.  (Consider putting
it in there anyway.  A few hours to swap it is cheap, rebuilding the
whole engine is not.  IMHO.)
