hey guys...
anyone want to decode my ID tag for me? I went to the m-code page and
other pages but it was all a mess to me...
my code is as follows

03 5
426 114-6 popouts
US 2213 TK BLW    3308743

thanks!
i have the small rear hatch and all too....kind of confusion since there
was a change from 63-64 and things like that...
i know it was built in march as my engine vents are pressed inwards..
