&gt; Quote of the week from 2 little kids walking by: &quot;Look at that! 

Don brings up a good point.  

Where ever I go and kids see my truck its always a long stare and
&quot;mommy/daddy look at that!&quot;  My kids are a bit jaded since VWs are a
part of our life, but its always a kick to drive them to school in
it...better than a limo my daughter says. 

 I was at an IN-N-OUT (So. Cal. tradition) one evening in the drive
through that adjoined the outdoor seating area, when a few small kids
ran up to my window and started oohing and awing at the truck.  They
were almost mesmerized by the truck and started hurling questions.
&quot;What's that?&quot; one asked, and &quot;why does it have a face?&quot;  I smiled and
answered as best I could and glanced at the not so approving parents who
obviously had their own preconceived ideas of what it was, and more
importantly, who I was...or was like.

Funny how we change when we grow up.  Innocence lost?  Well, maybe not
always if you're driving in something with a &quot;face&quot;.
