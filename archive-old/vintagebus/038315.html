On my way to work this morning, my '64 standard decided to spit the #1 plug out. Second time in a week. Guess it's time for real action.

Last weekend I put together a toolbox out of scrap wood, taking up basically the entire area above the engine compartment, but putting all my tools, spare parts, etc. within reach of the engine compartment, where I seem to do most of my road-side work. 'sides, it frees up space for people and stuff. I included a pair of leather gloves in the mix; great for working in a hot engine compartment--they helped today.

I knew the threads in this plug-hole were questionable when I installed the head, but I carefully threaded the plug in and hoped it would hold a long time in this otherwise good head. Since I don't have a good spare head, I'm thinking I will helicoil this puppy and make her last until I get a good spare and then switch her out. Of course, I have questions:

1. I have a plug insert, but no special tool to insert it. Can I do this using the spark plug itself and a spark plug wrench? Do I need to do any drilling? How worried about those metal shavings should I be?

2. When I replace the single head (or pull this head and repair it), should I loosen the other head so I can distribute torque again when I put this head back on?

Thanks! ...and happy Friday! Joe
