Hi NQ,
What darkness of welding eye protection are you using?  If we remember 
correctly, we use a darkness of #11 for ours and have no problem seeing where 
were are welding once it is started.  The trick also is to tilt the nozzle in 
the direction you are traveling and this seems to help show you where you are 
going.
