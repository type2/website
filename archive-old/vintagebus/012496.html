Because our hero had such a swell time with the lovebus and splits seemed
to hold their value so well, he wanted one. He decided on a Kombi because
the shipping company to Hawaii stated that no vehicles with a permanent
bed (RV) could be shipped home, therefore, Westys were out.
When he drove his Behemian lab partner home he noticed a blue split
parked down the street. It looked relatively unmolested and in one piece.
After a couple of times of taking Kevin home after class (and maybe
grabbing 5 checkerburgers for four dollars and discussing the
constitution and natural law of  the Bahamas and our their local
geography and climate) he settled on a course of action. He shmoosed the
owner and completed the necessary transactions; soon after, the Kombi was
his.

What sort of cognitive dissidence persuades the human psyche to develop
the &quot;need&quot; for a antique spinoff of the  third reich? What sort of
outside nurturing influences mold the natural inclination to sit in front
of the wheels?  What demographics (epidemiology?) are evident in this
affliction? Is any thing to be gained buy individual case study? Follow
along as we delve into the realm of our crazed hero's dementia and probe
it's depths.

Our hero had put the last  &quot;X&quot; in his student guide calendar and was free
to grow his beard. He could leave Florida.

 The first symptom of Splitomegagerintius is usually electrical.  At the
Clearwater maul parking lot the head light switch fried and the parking
light leads shorted to the headlights and then to ground. Our hero set on
the tarmac and pulled the headlight buckets. Maul security gave him
&quot;stink eye&quot; as they wirred by in their very official uniforms, driving
&quot;real customers&quot; to shop, driving in their electric Christmas choo-choos.
 With his trusty electrician's tool belt things were soon set  to our
heros low standard: test leads and wire nuts.
 What is the diagnosis of this? Our Hero is in need of peer review and
consultation. Perhaps we can help him to raise his admittedly low
standards and help set him on the right path. Is there a problem with 6
volt  switches in a 12 volt conversion?
