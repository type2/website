I've noticed this phenomenon also, and always
attributed it to an airlock in the filter.  Any better
ideas?  Anyway, like someone said, as long as the carb
is full.

&gt; I have noticed that the new fuel filter does NOT
&gt; stay full of gas.  To me, this seems like it AIN'T 
&gt; QUITE RIGHT.

&gt; I have noticed the same thing, perhaps it's because
&gt; you're a sucker. Pulling a vacuum on the filter    
&gt; would cause vapor to form, as would high temps.
