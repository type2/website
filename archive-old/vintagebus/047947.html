'50 Standard Split window bug.  Been sitting since the late 1960's.  It was 
driven into a barn around 1968 and sat there until 1975 when the guy I bought 
the car from bought it and had it towed out to Phoenix, AZ.  I bought the car 
about 3 years ago.  The pan, engine, transmission, etc etc are all original 
to the car.  The 25hp engine is complete even with the air cleaner.  As for 
the inside of the car the speedo pod is good and switches work nice but the 
speedometer is trashed.  The car is complete with tail lights, semaphores etc 
etc.  $7000 obo &lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:vwfool_at_aol_dot_com&quot;&gt;vwfool_at_aol_dot_com&lt;/A&gt;
