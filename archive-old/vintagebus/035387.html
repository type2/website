I went down and got a &quot;MAACO&quot; job and was verry mad! I spent 3 weeks sanding 
and preping the body, when they finished the first thing I knoticed was the 
engine was covered with over spray, they tried to fixed that but the block 
held on the the paint. About a week later the paint on the nose started to 
fall off, I took it back to them and they said, &quot;Well you should of said you 
were in a V.W. club and we would of not even touched it. We do not do  show 
paint and you get what you paid for&quot;. So I was stuck with runs in the paint 
small lines that showed metal, and later started to rust, but the worsed 
thing about it was they told me later if I would of gave them another 150.00 
they would of done it right! I spent 450.00 on crap that the new owner is 
going to have to sand off.

If you pay the extra $ Maaco would be ok, the paint that they use is good 
paint they just can't seen to put it on right unless you pay extra, but if I 
were you I would got to a real shop if you plan on having the paint stay on! 

Just my opinon. Mabey somone else out there has somthing good to say?
