Well yesterday I went back to the FLAPS and exchanged the generator (again)
for another rebuilt.  I have to tell you I am now pretty darned good at
pulling a generator without dropping the engine; it took me 45 minutes to
pull it and about an hour to put it back the second time around.

This time around I went ahead and replaced the voltage regulator as well.  I
was (and still am) pretty sure that it was just a bum rebuild; stuff
happens; but I wanted to hedge my bet and replaced it anyway.  The end
result is that we are 100% back in business and the beast is now on the
road.

(... the 'lets talk' part)
OK.  My bus is running, and now (sitting on the workbench in the garage) is
a voltage regulator that I am not sure is bad.  What tests can I run on the
VR to determine if it is still good.  I dont have a problem doing the  &quot;bad
part slam dunk&quot; into the trash can, and will do that if there is no simple
way to verify if it is good or not.  I just don't like throwing something
good away, even if I may not need it for like a zillion years :-)

Thanks in advance for putting up with me and any test procedures you can
offer up.
