There was a 63 highroof panel down here in L.A. last year.
Kinda weird bus, special ordered with belly pans, walk through, factory 12V, 
ambulance fans, 1500/big nut trans, I think there were more options that I 
forgot.
No, not all highroofs came with subflooring, but available as a special order 
for all busses.

&lt;&lt; Hey ANdrew did you ever dig up your m-code tag.  sounds like you have a 
special bus.  kinda wierd, hadn't heard of sub floors on buses that weren't 
double doors both sides or sunroof buses (that includes buses w/ dormobile 
top), either

Curious,

Clara
