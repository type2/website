Subject: John Brown's Buses in Harpers ferry, WV

Hi Folks,
Less than three weeks away from John Brown's Buses, October 18-20th in 
Harpers Ferry, WV.  Located 68 miles from Baltimore and 66 miles from 
Washington D.C.  I have it worked out with The KOA to hold 12 sites (there 
are more possible in the loop) until October 4th with out a deposit.  If 
you are planning to attend  If so, I want to make sure you have a 
spot.  please let me know and call KOA for reservations (304) 535-6895. 
They need a $35 deposit. Tell them that you are with John Brown's Buses. I 
checked with KOA and only four sites are accounted for as of Sunday.  To 
keep the hold on the sites, we need deposits on them by the 4th of 
October.  Less than three weeks away!  Hope to see you there!

Joy Thru Air,
Jamie Auch
