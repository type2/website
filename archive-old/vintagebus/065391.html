Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Testing Starters?

Here's a picture of a rig I built a couple days ago for 
starting an engine out of the car, although it can be used
to test starters, too.

You can see the 2 heavy red wires at the top, which go between the
switch and the starter, and you can barely make out the battery cables.  
The negative is attached to the lower starter bolt.  I
even wired up idiot lights.   Total parts cost is about $20,
including the battery cables but not the misc wires, which
came from a parts car, and not the battery or the starter,
either.  Credit goes to Tom Mink for building one of thse for me to copy.
