That's *the* biggest problem with that-certain-auction-site - unecessary bidding.
People will throw a bid in just to bump it up a couple bucks, without actually
making themselves the high bidder.  Basically taking money out of the other guy's
pocket and depositing it square into the sellers - for fun!  And it doesn't matter
if the secondary bidder knows the seller or not - it's still shilling.

I'm having a hard time selling the idea of sealed bidding, but this is a perfect
example of the craziness that goes on with that-certain-auction-site.  But that's
not the whole story: a lot of times in these stratosperic auctions, buyer's remorse
sets in, and the bidder doesn't cough up the green - essentially a doubly false
impression of the item's value.

With the sealed bids on my site, there's no bidding shenanigans - but it's those 
shenanigans are what these sellers are counting on to bring home the bacon.

Look for late-model westy tents to go for an arm-and-a-leg this show season.
