&gt; I've got a '67 Kombi, which is apparently the first year they had
&gt; an &quot;emergency flasher&quot; feature.  This is the switch on the dash that
&gt; supposedly makes all four turn signals flash at once to warn that the
&gt; vehicle is a road hazard.  Useful feature for a 31-year-old Bus..
&gt; 
&gt; Turning on the emergency flasher promptly blows a fuse -- but the turn
&gt; signals work fine.  Both are controlled by a big blue relay box
labeled
&gt; &quot;Blinkgeber&quot; (trans:  &quot;blinker&quot;) with about a dozen wires coming into
&gt; it, including feeds from the turn signal switch.

Check around the emergency flasher switch for short circuits to
ground. That was the problem with similar symptoms on my '71.

My theory is that the turn signal design group was the second place
new engineers were assigned at VW, right after a stint in the heater
design group.
