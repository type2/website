&gt; Dad often had the middle sear out. My brother sister
&gt;and I often road around in the bus seated at a kids ?
&gt;size picnic table that Dad put in. I wonder what the 
&gt;jail time would be for trying to get away with that
today :) .


That's nothing, to quote old VW deluxe bus ad copy
&quot;...You can even fit a playpen or crib in the back
without removing any of the seats (what better way to
transport a sleeping baby?)...&quot;

Yikes!
