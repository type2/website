I have had this happen, too.
I believe in my case it was just a crappy cable, because the next one I
got was finished a lot nicer at the male end ( wheel end) and didnt
break right away. There are at least three cable manufacturers, probably
more. There is Italian ( pirelli) Mexican ( I forget the brand) and
brazillian. The one I had break was Mexicxan.
