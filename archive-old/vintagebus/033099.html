Well authentic vin and m codes would matter to me, it just makes it special. 
You know the bus came with that stuff, and thats what matters, not tricking 
the kids at the next SOTO meet. I am not saying you cant use reproduction 
parts to restore it, its would be real hard not to. 

Yeah, you are right, it is coachbuilt, but so was Binz. If everyone would 
like, I will start converting crewcabs if there is enough demand, and I also 
might make a hearse or two. I think Everett wants a Binz?

And who needs to sell to Japan anyways, oh yeah, the people that have turned 
the hobby into a business.

 &lt;&lt; current panel needs lots of work, and would be real expensive, 
  but owning a one off bus like that would be well worth it. Or cheaping out 
  and loosing the vin # and M # from the original will make up for the money 
 to 
  be made when it would be sold to Japan when done. Don't say it cant be 
 fixed, 
  I bet Kelly could. &gt;&gt;
 
  if it matters vins and m codes are transferable. just get a similar bus. or 
 just forget about it, and put it on another year. I wouldn't care if I were 
 buying. as long as it was well done, and the year of the bus fell within the 
 time span that the company was building them.
 
 It's coach built anyway, it is no longer factory original. if it felt better 
 you could wear coveralls with the conversion companys logo on them while you 
 sawed it apart.
 
 You dot need to have an original to get high dollars from Japan. Note 
factory 
 rug top standard with six sky lights on the Japanese sight posted to the 
list 
 a few days ago.
  
 But Kelly probably could fix it. &gt;&gt;
