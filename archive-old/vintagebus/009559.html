&gt; Would be interesting to take a look at some 72 type 4 bus stock carbs.
&gt; Especially the venturi size of them.   We have been wondering about using
&gt; early 40 HP carbs.  Since they were engineered for 1200cc two of them
should
&gt; work well on a 2000cc engine.  We think the 34 PICT-4 would be too big,
&gt; unless you are planning on drag race instead of driving long distances.

Good points all of them.  The 34-pict-3 would need to be rejetted I'm sure.
Ronnie mentioned that the 34-pict-3's should mount right on a 72 bus set of
manifolds as those were Solex carbs that came factory.  All you would need
to do is jet them correctly.  Also, I have some 34ICT's that I might try
using as well.  I just like the idea of chokes as this cold weather makes it
very tough to start my Weber 40's in the mornings.

Thanks for the input!
