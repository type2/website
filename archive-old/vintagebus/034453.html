 The tag reads:
 
 11 8  (Which would stand for August 11th, 1965)  (This would have been the
 1966 model year correct?)

right
..........
 425 002 081 114 130
 
 I've confirmed the following:

 114:6 popout side windows - bus
 130:type 24 without sunroof and roof windows - bus

 UL: United States Port 'L'
 2412:???

model- deluxe 8 seater (walkthrough) bus

 424271:???

colour codes - lotus white/lotus white paint, aero baleric interior- pretty 
uncommon
......
 6009127:VIN
 --  -- 
actually the VIN is 246 009 127 which is the number which would be on the 
title (or should be), the 6009127 is the serial number, the intial 6 
indication a '66 model year vehicle.

 No big surprises here.  I knew I had a 1966 low end deluxe but it's nice
 seeing what the tag can tell you.
