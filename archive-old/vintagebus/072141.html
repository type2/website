Subject: Re: [VB] vaseline: dielectric grease Odd Turn Indicator Problem

&gt; hmm... what is in dielectric grease anyway?   I thought it had something to

Hi Clara,
Due to Dielectric grease being silicon based it probably is more stable than 
Vaseline and thusly longer lasting.  So if one was thrifty (BTDT!) it would 
make sense to use Vaseline in areas where one often takes apart like battery 
terminals and clamps.  Then use the Dielectric grease on places like fuse boxes, 
and underdash wiring connections, that you rarely get into and want to stay 
corrosion free longer due to you not wanting to tear them apart again for as 
long as possible.
