Subject: input shaft play &amp; clutch arm wear
Message-ID: &lt;376A6F2C.A2ECD2E2_at_nations_dot_net&gt;

Hi Y'all
I've been off to school and it's great to be greeted by many e-mails
with bus content when I get home.  Too bad I have to go back for another
week on Sunday.

Seeing as school's in Mayport Fl and I'm in Charleston SC I can't
commute daily (5 hours each way by BMW motorcycle).  I really wanted to
take the Tinkertoy, but Saturday last a strange thing happened.  She got
REALLY hard to shift, and I had to keep a foot on the brake while in
gear at the lights.  I suspected clutch arm troubles but didn't have the
time to pull the engine

Did midterm yesterday afternoon so I could sneak home on Thursday
instead of Friday since Mom was up from Florida visiting and leaves
Sunday.  Mom &amp; wife &amp; daughter went off to Magnolia Plantation to look
at stuff and Alex (the big guy) and I pulled the engine.  Sure as vacum
cleaners suck when turned on the throwout bearing was askew in the
housing, both clips were on the bottom, and the pressure plate showed
signs of strange wear.  The clutch arm shows wear as well.

Questions:
What's the best replacement clutch arm in a 67?
What's the best cost effective replacement?
How much play should I feel in the transaxle input shaft (Todd?)

Any and all help gratefully [Image] accepted.
