ASAIK, the 1.40 reduction gears were the barndoor ones (completely differnt
set up)

from 3/55 through 63s they had 1.39s - the little nut stub axles

and 64-67 have 1.36s - the big nut rear axles
I don't think the alternate non standard gearing ie 'mountain gearing' is as
common as people think.

so my advice if you are looking for 1.26 reduction boxes, look for big nuts.
they did change some stuff inside the tranny for 66/67, but the axles
/outboard gears remained the same

&gt; &lt;&lt; I am looking for this VW trans info so I can tell what I am looking at
&gt;  when I go to a swap meet. I WANT TO GET THE  66-67 reduction box.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; The 1964-67bus used the same reduction gear boxes as far as we can tell.
&gt; Unless one ordered something different like mountian gearing.  Eric &amp; Barb

  Dear Eric&amp; Barb
                My research has show the following reduction box
information...
                                           Reduction box raitos
1958    1.40
1959    1.39
1960    1.39
1961    1.39
1962    1.39
1963    1.39
1964    1.39/1.26
1965    1.39/1.26
1966    1.26
1967    1.26
    I have not been able to tell the 64/65 differences by any method.  i.e.  M
CODES or
trans. stampings. The only way to be sure ( with out a tear-down ) would seem
to be stick with the 66/67. I know that these raitos seem small but add them
to all the ring and pinion changes..... it means alot on the road . Once
again, my research shows the 4.375 R&amp;P raitos only for sure in the 66/67.
SOOOOO.
    Thank you for all your help.
Your VW Friend  Paul in Ohio.
ps Still looking for a way to tell 66/67 from a external inspection.
