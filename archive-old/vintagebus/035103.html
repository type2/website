 ....Anyone have ANY information on this gauge?  Sorry for not
 having pics up 
 right now but I have like 12 rolls of film on the bus but not
 enough cash to 
 get it developed =(
 
 Problem solved, sell the bus to me and go get the photos developed.

Gas gauges were standard on ambulances and an option on not ambulances before 
62, not sure about barndoors.  So they get 271 part numbers.  But I have 
found dealer installed gas gauge w/sender in a 58 micro.   The gauge was 
dated 56, as was the sender, the sender was red. nifty huh.  The gauge face 
reads EMPTY to FULL.  Or actually the 61 dated guage read that, the 56 ones I 
have seen were in German, and FULL is VOLL, not R to 1/1.  And the bezel is 
slightly differnt.

hope this is relevant
