&gt; Sorry, but your fix is not going to last very long.  What you did is
referred to
&gt; as &quot;broaching&quot; and now you have even less material to support the
valve stem.

I think that this is more like knurling.  Knurling is the denting of
metal in localized areas to displace material that bulges up between
the localized areas.

Broaching is the passing of increasingly larger shaped cutters through
a hole to gradually cut the hole large and to shape.

I agree on the expected life of the fix.  New head time.
