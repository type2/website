Hello Seth   First you have to make sure that you do have a 40hp engine as 
the parts aren't interchangable with any other vw motors. Read the number below 
the generator stand , no not the one that says zundfolge1-4-3-2  that is the 
firing order  LOL   You can get big bore kits for these and the best are Mahle 
, Cofab , Koberscmit  later  Mark Dearing
