Subject: Steal Your Face tees are in

Hello Volks,

Just wanted to let everyone know that the Steal Your Face tee shirts came in
yesterday and they look great!  I got a very small amount of cool
shortsleeves in earthtone colours as well.  If you are interested in the
shortsleeve designs, please email to verify that I have the colour and size
that you want before sending funds.  I put a couple pics up so everyone
could take a look here: http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcamper72/Shirts102903.
All payments sent via PayPal will ship within 24 hours by Priority Mail.

Cool Runnings,
Jay Brown
