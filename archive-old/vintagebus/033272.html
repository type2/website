&lt;&lt; When It is idling in neutral and I release the clutch I hear a loud

Hi Boyd,
If you mean this noise only occurs when you have let up on the clutch pedal 
while in nuetral then it sounds like the tranny is on it's way out.  Due to 
the bearings on the input shaft going bad.  So start looking, and saving.  
Also check when you last changed the tranny oil, and make sure the tranny is 
full to keep it going reliably as long as possible.   Eric&amp;Barb
