Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Geyser Repost

Great! At least I'm gettin' some where. Thanks!

Is it the gas cap then? It has venting (allegedly) - this gerry-rigged hole
in the center of the cap. As it obviously not the cap that goes on a VW bus.
I was assured it'd work just as well, as no one could find anything else

I'm concluding, then, that the cap itself is wrong.
