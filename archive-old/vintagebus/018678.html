Nothing.

&gt; Another idea, has anybody tried sandblasting the screw area of the window
&gt; frames to remove the rust and let what ever lubricant access the area
&gt; easier?  Just Curious.

A couple problems; a) how in the heck can you limit the blasting to that
tiny area; b) blasting will only remove the surface rust - it will look
purty, but your problem lies within the threads, grashopper...

I'd try CLR instead of muriatic.  It's a lot gentler.
