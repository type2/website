do you gat alot of glare at night using that brand? I used some anti fog/rain 
stuff a few years ago and swore it off afterwards due to the glare it caused. 
Also have heard it said (by more than one) that you can cut a potato in two  
and rub the juicy part on the window. never tried it though.

never used that.  I rely on working wipers, working heater with defog on as 
neccessary.  Also I like to polish and wax the windsheilds each year as that 
helps reduce glare from the millions of tiny dust scratches in the glass.
