Subject: Repop side mirrors

I know that Izzy's had the number and vw logo stamped on the ring on the
back. I do not know about the exact finish. There was one other high
quality repo around that same time that had the number and logo as well.
I don't know how they got away with this, but just letting you know that
just because the number and logo are there it still may not be original.
I believe Izzy's were stainless instead of aluminum, but I am not sure.
hope this vagueness helps,
Craig
