Subject: VW matchbooks

Jan &amp; I went to the Moss Landing antique fair today.
As a nice gift I was given to front striking matchbooks.
They were from
 SEE VAN WYK
authorized
 VOLKSWAGEN
 and
 Porsche dealer
5900 E Speedway
sales
service
parts
Tucson, Arizona


Is this dealer still there and what has happened to their 60's parts stash?
