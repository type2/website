Subject: Seat belt retrofit?

I was wondering if anybody has retrofitted seatbelts into their bus? I have a 63 which as many of you knw does not have them, but the dilemma is my 5 year old loves the bus and is always wanting to go for a ride but there is no way by law for him to. NC state law doesn't require me to retrofit them and neither does the military base I work on, but the boy does have to be strapped in and there are certain situations that have arisen that require him to ride with me but so far it's a no go. Any insight is much appreciated.
