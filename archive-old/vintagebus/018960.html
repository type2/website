I've finally started really working on the Westy and I've come across a few issues already.  One problem, which may or not be a problem, is the subflooring.  I've got full subflooring (&quot;belly pans&quot;) on my bus, and I was wondering will this cause any trouble with maintenance?  I was thinking about maybe shifter stuff, since it runs up in there.  I noticed while pulling out the tranny for a rebuild that the shift rod is hidden much of the way to the front.  Would I have to cut it open?  Is there anything in there at all?

Next is brake drums.  I know this has been discussed before, but I was wondering what people thought with prices and parts being what they are today.  I either need to turn most of my drums or get new ones, as they are either out of round a hair or scored/rusty (sat 20 years).  I could of course way easier afford to get them turned, but I've heard that this may not be good for my braking ability, etc.  If it's done well, is there any real advantage in getting new hardware instead?
