&gt; I believe that the flasher light
&gt; is a one year only in 1965

I think the flashers are on a few years...I saw one on the 63 i took apart in
a junkyard that was all there and stock.  no signs of front end replacement.
I also saw one on Woody's 64 I believe.  I thought they were 63-66 or
something like that...

sorry for the extra post...it just entered my mind.
