I'm still churning this 6v 12v stuff over in my head.  I'm sure when it's
all said and done, I'll wonder why it seemed so hard to decide but I have
another question that I'd like some input on.

Supposing I do convert to 12volts, JCW lists this little &quot;regulated voltage
reducer&quot; that is seemingly nothing more than a resistor on a metal band.  It
is meant for current draw less than 1amp.  You hook one end up to the guage
and then the other end to your power source.  I assume the stock vw bus fuel
gauge from 1966 pulls less than 1 amp - does anyone know?

I also would guess that this would not work for the stock radio and clock -
matter of fact, I'm sure it wouldn't.

Since I have now learned you must use 1 voltage dropper per accessory
(thanks for all the firm warnings I received about trying to &quot;share&quot; devices
off of one voltage dropper) things are starting to make sense now I guess or
I hope.

I've ridden in a bus that was converted to 12v and everything seemed great
and worked well.  This was with Diana Krebs in her 66 Westy.  I can honestly
say that her running 12v didn't change the ride, the fuel mileage, or rob
the bus of any coolness factor. :-)

One other factor that is certainly going to influence my decision is that  I
*DO* want to run a 12v stereo someplace in the bus including a homemade mpeg
player that will necessitate using a power invertor.  I think that really
sinches the decision to convert over.  I can't imagine the hell it would
cause trying to get a power invertor for 6v - I bet they don't even exist.

Now if you all will excuse me, I've got something thinking to do. :-)
