Bob wrote that he needed an early Westy childs cot pattern:

I just had a new childs cot made for my '59 Westy.  I was lucky enough to have an original, but since I had to redo all of my cushions I needed the cot to match.  I can have these made very easily, the cost is $40.00.  But herein lies the problem: what do you make it out of?  Unless you redo all of your rear camper area cushions, the cot won't match.  If you don't care about that, then send me the fabric you want it made out of.  Keep in mind that if you're going to use it you'll need to use fabric that can withstand the wieght of a small child.  There are also some straps and hooks on the cot, but these aren't hard to repop either.  The second problem is the pole.  It's nothing fancy, but one will need to be made.  It's nothing more than a pole with two squarish brackets on both ends, but the cost of fabricating this isn't included in the $40.00.  I could probably make them, but I've decided not to take on any new projects until I get this freekin' bus finished. 

I personally am sick of driving american cars to the shows!!!!!  I need a damn bus to drive!
