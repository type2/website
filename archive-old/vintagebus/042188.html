Hey all you wonderful candadians...a bit offtopic, but I will someday get
him in a bus...anyway.

My little brother has wandered off to Canada for his summer
adventure.._dot_carless.  He hitched a flight to PA, and some chicks came down
and picked him up..(and a friend of his from school.)


So.  His description of where he is:

&quot;...I am located right now it is a citty called trois rivieres I think.  
It means &quot;three rivers&quot;.  I`m pretty sure that it is about 1 hour north of
montreal.&quot;


So, being the big brother I am..If these chicks decide to leave them
stranded....anyone in the area they could call for emergancy assistance?
(email, phone, shower.:)


thanks..david (of course, I meant to send him with a TTT..but I forgot.)
