Subject: Re: [VB] Enjoying the bus.

Hmm...if _that_ works, I wonder about the HOV lanes in downtown Atlanta?  I've often stared longingly at them from my parking place on the far right.  Sign sez &quot;Carpools, motorcycles and BUSES only&quot; :-)  I'm sure an interesting day in traffic court could be had with that one...!

Incidentally, I've found that the bus makes a terrific traffic crawler.  It'll do walking-speed without any clutching!
