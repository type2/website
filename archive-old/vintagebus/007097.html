Hello Again

    I have a spare 66 front beam that I got for free and it needs to be
rebuilt. I would like to in the process shorten the beam as well and put in
an adjustable beam kit. I am looking at this beam and from what I have heard
is that they usually shorten them 2-1/2 inches. How do they take 2 -1/2
inches off the beam when it needs to bolt up to the factory location? Do
they bolt it to the inside of the frame or modifying something else? This
will probably get me flamed but I still have the beam the bus came with that
is stock and I just want to modify a beam that has seen better days and make
it worth something to someone with a Cal bus after I am done with it.

Enlightenment needed please!
Thanks in advance
