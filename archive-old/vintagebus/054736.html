Subject: How to update A.I.R.S.  information?

Hey all,
i am a member of the type2 A.I.R.S. list. I was  just looking at the site and realized that some of my information (email address) has changed since the time I originally put myself on the list.  Anybody out there know how I would go about updating my info here?? 



Peace, John Baker
