&lt;&lt; Speaking of window swaps, I'm looking to trade a real nice set of sekurit
 side sliding windows with holes for the latches for a pair of non-through
 hole sekurit windows....  I have latches for the trade but don't necessarily
 need latches in return.
 
 Anybody?

you are looking for glass w/o holes?   I believe that that kind is always the 
sigla, the sekurit ones have holes for the latches. or one hole, if for 
barndoor

probably to do with the sigla glass being easier to break, so they put the 
latches on a track under the glass.  Unfortunately, it does tend to break and 
chip and crack and fog, so that siglas glass is hard to find in perfect 
condition.
