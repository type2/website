ISP West are a restoration shop (mainly type 1's and Ghia's) and parts house
(oldschoolvw can enlighten us more on this). They have direct connections to
Germany (owned by Germans I've heard) and import directly. They have raised
there reserves on you know as a lot of there parts were selling below there
cost. They do have a tendency to call new parts NOS but I think that is just
in there pre set wording. As for the longer seal it is a 72 and later more
then likely.

Is this for a '63-down bus or '64-up?  If for '64-up, something does seem 
odd there.  Is this seal made of three sections glued together? If so, is 
one section a slightly different color than the others?

it appears that it may have been glued... but its a *very* clean seam. the 
top corners are squared off... the two bumps at the beltline are there... 
and the cutouts at the bottom of the hatch in the luggage area and the 
striker plate are there too. its nice.

But nobody actually answered my question, who is ISP West?
