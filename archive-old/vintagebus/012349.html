&gt; BTW: neither the sump heater or the hotplate will thaw out your frozen
&gt; doors! :) Try paste wax on the door frames and seals.

For that, I use a &quot;Popcorn Pumper&quot; hot air popcorn popper.  Take the
plastic top off and you have a fan-forced electric heater on a stable
base.  It sits between the front seats and defrosts the windows nicely
when I plug it in for a half-hour or so before I leave.
