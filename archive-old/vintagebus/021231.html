Put the back end of the car in the air, and spin one
wheel and see how much rotation it takes until the other
one turns.  It shouldn't be much - maybe 1/8&quot; turn?

How much does the shifter move when you let off the gas?
1/8&quot;?  1/4&quot;?  3&quot;?

Excessive wear in the hockey stick &amp; nose cone?  Cracked
nose cone?

&gt; When i let out my clutch and the bus begins to move
&gt; forward i get a loud and solid clunk from the rear. I
&gt; also experience  my shifter moving as i let off the
&gt; gas. Here is a list of what i have done so far:
&gt; All new mounts (bell housing and nose cone)
&gt; Checked bolts at redux box to spring plate
&gt; new shift coupler
&gt; new clutch(heavy duty)
&gt; new pressure plate (200mm)
&gt; Checked all lug nuts
&gt; checked the rear axle nuts
&gt; I am going to yank it out tonight to replace the Gland
&gt; nut and polish up the shaft.
&gt; Short of buying a new tranny, are there any other
&gt; ideas?
