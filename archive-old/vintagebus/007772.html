I dont know who wanted this (missed that email) but heres my version with
some of Kirin's thrown in:)
The Seatspring - &quot;pretty fly for a &quot;bus&quot; guy&quot;

(intro voice) &quot;Bentley , Haynes, Muir and E-bay.&quot;
(drums)

Restore it with me baby ...barndoor!.. barndoor!
Restore it with me baby ...rusted!.. rusted!
Restore it with me baby ...resto!... resto!
And college girls say im pretty fly for a bus guy

ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf -  funf, sechs.

OUR buslist had its fair share- of bus guys in the past,
.. some of them said &quot;type2 wha?&quot;, and they weren't gonna last.

Well this new guy ain't loaded, but this new guy has smarts.
His bus may be in shambles, but he'll mortgage for the parts!

Chorus:
So he has a beard, talks kinda wierd
He's got every veedub magazine for the last 15 years.

Working like a dog, 9 to 5 job.
its all for the bus, its all for the bus...

Just say &quot;free buses here&quot;,  and he'll kick into gear.
...he will bring the towbar but you better bring the beer.

........his diet consists of pizza, hey hey- lets overhaul this thing!

(restore it with me baby x 4)

He shops at discount swapmeets, not just any will suffice.
He has to find a bargain,  cause' he wont pay retail price.

He never ask directions, cause he doesnt really care.
As long as he is in the &quot;cruise&quot;,  he's bound to make it there!

So grab your red wagon,  and bring the wife along.
he's bound to find plenty of parts but his arms aren't that strong.

Youll see him spend, too, much, cause its, so, much, fun.
You wonder if his buying will.....will... ever be done!

Restore it with me baby ...barndoor!.. barndoor!
Restore it with me baby ...rusted!.. rusted!
Restore it with me baby ...resto!... resto!
ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf - funf, sechs.

the end :)
what is this for again? hehe
