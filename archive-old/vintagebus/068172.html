Subject: Re: [VB] How much pressure to grease king pin zerks?

&gt; It is super-easy to grease the link pin zerks. But I cannot get enough 
&gt; pressure on the gun to grease the king pin zerks. And I bet I'm putting a 
&gt; fair amount of pressure in there (and I have a large sized grease gun.)

Hi Conrad,
It is a must to jack the front end up until the front wheels are just off the 
pavement before trying to pump grease into the king pins every 3,000 miles.  
After greasing the zerks you can then adjust the brakes and keep them in tip 
top shape!
