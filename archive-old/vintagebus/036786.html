I have had a couple requests to post my shifter extension website address 
again.  I have updated since the first posting.

http://hometown.aol_dot_com/thatvwguy/myhomepage/auto.html

Several went out this week and should be with their new owners now or will be 
very soon.  Thanks for the orders guys!

Thanks,
Dan Kinsey
