Subject: Re: [VB] New steering wheels

They very well could be those made by our very own &quot;SteeringWheelMan&quot; Chris.
Chris lives in Torrance, which is next door to Carson where ISP West is
headquartered.  I looked at the auction and it does look like Chris' work.

&gt; and what kind of quality they are?
