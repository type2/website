Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor drive shaft ID and swap

Hi Matt,
If we remember correctly the distributir drive with the gear machined down on 
about 2/3s of its length was used in engines 3 400 000 up to 5 500 000.  The 
drive with the short gear area cast onto it was used from engine 5 500 001.  
Remember that pre-Bastard 40 HP fuel pump rods run horizontal  in the engine 
case, verses the post-36 HP rod which run in the vertical.  Thusly the rod lobe 
area of the drive has to reflect this change in fuel pump rod position in the 
engine case.
