I received confirmation that this Bus on my site:

http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/standards/bus1.jpg

was stolen approx. 2 years ago.  Owner is from the Bay Area, Bus was stolen in L.A..  Yeah, it's a long time ago, but you never know.  Here's the description:

Restored '67 Deluxe 21-window - Green/white
Please contact Raul at DJRatedRSJ_at_aol_dot_com (not the owner) if you have any info.  It has a distinctive tan-colored pinstripe along the beltline.

Story was the owner was visiting Disneyland down in L.A., he used it quite a bit for a day or 2, someone apparently followed him from the grocery store to his mom's house, he stopped to pick something up inside and within a few minutes, it was gone.

It was the first Bus picture I scanned to put on my site!  

Thanks.
