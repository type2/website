Subject: Re: [VB] Safari's and the Man

[...]

Yet another reason to move out to a nice rural area. In my smallish 
west texas town I drive around all the time with them open. the 
&quot;fuzz&quot; could care less. I'm actually more worried about getting a 
ticket for going to slow on the highway or something. If they pull 
you over for it there, they are probably just looking for a reason to 
search you for drugs or to run your name for warrants. Everyone who's 
on the road out here, cops, UPS guys, even general commuters...know 
my bus. At least once a day I have someone talk to me about it. 
Saying that they see it driving around or whatever. And the windows 
are always a big hit.

Biggest concern I have with the windows is the bugs slapping me in 
the face! Hurts like crap! I ALWAYS wear shades when I drive now.


&gt;I was wondering how many of you out there drive with your safari's 
&gt;open and have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the SoCal 
&gt;area and I asked a CHP officer the other day about it and he said 
&gt;that it was illegal to drive with them open and that if they saw me 
&gt;doing it, they'd ticket me.  So I was curious if anyone has ever 
&gt;recieved a ticket for an open safari.
