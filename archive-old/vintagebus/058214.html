Subject: Re: [VB] MORE on the Clutch Spring

the way I got the spring on is put the arm on part way, then wiggle the 
spring onto the arm, then tap the arm on the rest of the way.

but it was completely impossible with the engine in (the circlip holding the 
arm on had fallen off)  so after I tried that thinking it would save time, I 
pulled the engine

good luck, hope that cold brew helps
