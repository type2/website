In my 61 side loader I used PB Blaster, I sealed the tip of the spray can
against the cable then slowly sprayed it in, took 2 days, also did the same
from the rear, 2 days later cable free, still need to pull completely out to
really soak the cable sheath. The problem is though that your cable sheath
is probably totally gone inside from rust and freeing up the cable will
leave you with a hollow plastic tube for the cable to slide. Inspect it good
from underneath and try to determine the shape of the sheath before spinning
your wheels trying to get the cable free. The cable is usually held in place
with bent over tabs and you could carefully pull it out with a guide wire
attached and then pull the new one through, even if you miss the hold tabs
on reinstall both ends are attached so it would still function alright.

&lt;&lt; but this scares the sh*t outta me!  wouldn't positioning the bus the same

way and then spraying penetrating liquid do the same thing (almost) but be a

whole lot less dangerous? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rachel,
The problem with just penetrating oil is the amount of surface area of the 
cable inside the tube.  In a way it is like having a hinge pin about 12' 
long, and you know how hard hinge pins of only 3-4&quot; length can be.  While
oil 
will reduce the friction some, acid will remove by dissolving the swollen 
ironoxide inside the tube against the entire length of the cable flex tube!
  Really though any chemical can be dangerous if not handled correctly or 
without proper tools.  There have been known of people who have drowned in 
only an inch deep of water!
 Muriatic is the commercial term for hydrochloric acid.  Muriatic is the
main 
force in inexpensive drain cleaners people use everyday!  Hydrochloric is 
matter of fact the chemical in your stomach that is dissolving that burger 
you had for lunch into a soup you intestines can strain out the needed 
nutrients for your body.  Phosphoric acid is what you drink in colas 
especially in Coke to keep the carmel sugar in it from just settling to the 
bottom and the one acid we prefer.  In the stronger acid forms these can be 
dangerous but handleable.  Unlike sulfuric acid which once it is on your
skin 
will immeadiately burn you and continue to even after is is washed off the 
outside of the skin due to soaking in, but we all have still handled and 
worked with these acid type of car batteries!
  So break out the rubber gloves, goggles and go to work!  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Wonder if using melted wax to make a funnel mounted around the forward
end 
of the cable tube would work with these kind of acids better than puddy 
covered with plastic?
PPS Take a look at what SOBs in Bangladesh are doing to women with sulfuric 
acid when thier offers of dates or marriage are turned down.  Hopefully
after 
seeing this kind of damage volks will be more carefull of causing sparks
over 
or even near thier acid type of battery which can cause it to explode in
your 
face!  Also keep you acid/water level up over the plates inside the battery 
will keep it from exploding when starting the engine.
