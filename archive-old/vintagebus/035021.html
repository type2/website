Hey list,

 when did the bench seats that were split so the driver could slide his seat

forward, start being standard approximately? And did they start that the

same year on trucks?

-Wade-

- - - - 

the 1/3 2/3 front seat with the siding drivers seat started 30 July 62, same 
time they went to the later doglegs and wheel wells. Same whether truck or 
not.

LHD Walk throughs had a sliding drivers seat earlier, from May 61 .   It was 
a diff seat with the sliding lock lever on the right side of he seat (not the 
front at the right)- it pokes into the walkthrough aisle.
