Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Oil light flickers on new rebuild. UPDATE

For those who have followed this saga.....
The new pump solved the problem. Good pressures at all RPMs, runs a little
cooler, and about 10-12 pressure at idle at operating temps.

The Berg pump is MUCH superior to the junk from the flaps.

Thanks again for all the help!

&gt; History: New rebuilt 1600 SP doghouse engine, DR bored case.
&gt; Symptom: Poor oil pressure at idle once hot.
&gt;
&gt; I think I have found the problem. I removed the NEW oil pump today to
check
&gt; it and found three things.
&gt;
&gt; 1) The backlash was excessive. The Wilson book says there should be no
&gt; audible clicking between the gears when wiggled holding one gear
stationary.
&gt; There was way too much motion. (crappy manufacture) I dug out the old oil
&gt; pump and checked, and it is much better with over 100,000 miles of use. I
&gt; wish I had saved the box to give you guys a heads up on the brand name.
&gt;
&gt; 2) The shaft for the driven gear should be slightly recessed. On this one,
&gt; there was actually a outward portion of metal remaining that was holding
the
&gt; cover plate away from the housing. (crappy manufacture).
&gt;
&gt; 3) The gears measured 21mm! Two idiots involved: The flaps guy that sold
me
&gt; the wrong part and the builder (me) who did not check. :-(
&gt;
&gt; I ordered a standard 26mm pump from Clyde Berg today and really think this
&gt; will solve the problem. Fingers crossed. Thanks for all the help and
input.
