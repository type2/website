Subject: Re: [VB] Won't start

&gt; &gt; rather quickly, thanks for the advice from the group on using a flat,
&gt; &gt; ratcheting wrench from Sears ( They don't make a 17mm, but 11/16 is same as
&gt; &gt; 17mm and ONLY $7.99!!) on that upper left nut.  (I had it back on in less
&gt; &gt; than 10 seconds!! Thanks Cal)
&gt;
&gt; Yer welcome (bows shyly)! (in the mid-90s, they did make the 17/19mm one
&gt; that's in my toolbox - times change!)

19mm Wrench, Reversible Ratcheting
Sears #: 00942430000

Craftsman	17mm Wrench, Reversible Ratchetig
Sears #: 00942428000

I dont see a 19/21 combo listed.
there is a 15/17   and a 19/21.
there are cheap sets of metric combos but none seem to include 17
there are ratchet/open end seta that include 17 and 19.
