Subject: Re: [VB] List Issues

&gt; Compared to the type2 list admin junta, I'm a bleeding
&gt; heart tree hugger.  They have have the word &quot;ebay&quot; filtered at the server
level, among
&gt; others.  They wouldn't have politely suggested to take it to Friday; they
would have
&gt; dropped you from the list distribution, killfiled you, kiboshed all of the
relevant
&gt; replies, and kicked your dog.

Absolutely correct. In a way I miss when Ken did the whole Type 2 list
moderation thing. You knew when you read a post if the poster would be
booted or reprimanded, and you sure knew there was a &quot;Please kill this
thread&quot; coming. There wasn't a second one, either. It was like a bonus layer
of entertainment. Bye bye now, miss you... I'm not capping on Thom for his
looser style, I happen to enjoy the list a tad more now because I very
seldom have to read about them fat chick busses. There is a bit more off
topic stuff, but not near what they have at the RAMVA newsgroup, or
vintagevw, etc. And it doesn't seem to be escalating, so I'm content using
the delete key.  Folks should review the list charter from time to time, and
not be bent on posting stuff that violates it without needing input from an
administrator. There is the Friday rule, and there is the buslife list. More
than enough latitude to discuss irrelevant issues. You are on the loosest,
yet still functional VW related list that I know of. Be happy, short tempers
are for SUV drivers.
