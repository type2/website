&lt;&lt; I know you can guy whole kits with reground lifters, cams, etc. but is 
that necessarily the best way to do things? &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
Only if you trust the shop you buy them from.  Unless you have very good 
references of a shop/s to supply you by post with these rebuilt/reground 
pats, best to get them from a local shop if possible.  Alot easier to deal 
with those at arms reach.  We can reccomend you to give Bear's VW Machine in 
San Diego a call Butch at (619) 691-8385 on some stuff you will need.  Please 
tell him that we said &quot;Hi!'.  They probably can supply you with a CW crank, 
and new, or rebuilt heads with 9mm thick exuast valve shafts instead of the 
stock 7mm.  The thicker the shaft material the less problem of having the 
exaust valves stretch due to high heat, and finally have one of the heads of 
the exaust valves pop off.    Eric&amp;Barb
