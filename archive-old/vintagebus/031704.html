Thanks Thom for sharing that great story with us. It reminded me of when I
went to Europe in the early 70's and ended up staying 2 1/2 years, just wish
I would have thought of getting a VW Bus (bus content) then instead of the
$150.00  oval rag top that we drove till it blew up in Italy (just left it
on the road) then ended up with a F#_at_d mini panel van in Greece. My journey
started in Sweden (my grandmas and ended up in Greece) I was on my way to
India, you know that Beetles, hippy kind of thing.

I bought a pile of Foreign Car Guides at the silent auction at the Kelley
Park
Dinner, and in one of them was this cool article aboutone family's 85-day
trip thru Europe, starting with the purchase of a bus in Germany, 
then driving it up to Westfalia to have the camper kit installed, which
took 8 hours and cost $259.70!
