Having looked through my records for the past 2 years we have sold 56 new VW
Brazilian (actually Mexican 50 of them) and 6 of the VW Brazilian (Actually
Brazil ) and not have had any returned for failure or any problems. All of
the new VW Mexican engines (we sold) have the Brazilian (Mexican case) and I
have had only 2 returned, but these were for broken cams and fully
warranted. The Brazilian ( Brazil case)
are AS 41 universal cases with the type 3 dipstick hole (but also have a
stock dipstick tube installed). The Brazilian (Mexican)case is also a AS 41
case, but with out the type 3 pick-up and a larger oil pick-up tube. I have
heard of some isolated problems, but have been fortunate not to have
encountered any of these.

I am currently building a 1800 (74 by 88) for my bus and am using a
Brazilian (Brazil) case. When at the machine shop for fly cutting checked
the bore, then upon cleaning checked all passages. Checked the oil pump for
hole line-up and the cam bore for alignment, so far so good. We are also
doing a 1776 with the Brazilian (Mexico) case and haven't encountered any
problems.

As with all engine builds it's always wise to check all passages and bores,
whether using a new or used case.

Does anyone have ideas/experience with inspecting new
1600 cases for casting defects or substandard workmanship?
Are there common problems to watch out for?

thanks...
