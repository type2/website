Wait just a cotton-pickin' minute....

Satoshi Sakata?

He sure sounds....JAPANESE!!!!

(cue dramatic music - dah dah DAH!!!)

And isn't Long Beach an international PORT!!!

Nice try, mister!

You think you would use the benevolent nature of the
list to key you in on a reputable shop to tune your
double-door barndoor kombi/deluxes before you EXPORT
them to the Empirial motherland?

NOT SO FAST!

&quot;And I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for
that dumb dog and those meddling kids&quot;


Wait another cotton-pickin' minute.  Thom posted this.
Isn't he the one who just &quot;Happened upon&quot; a bardnoor
single cab? which just &quot;happened to include&quot; TWO extra
engines?

I bet those Pearl Harbor-bombing &quot;neighbors&quot; would
love to have their hands on one of those!

And wait another cotton-pickin' minute! &quot;Fitzpatrick?&quot;
Aren't you Irish?

Well kiss my Blarney stone!

Where's that 54 RHD going after all that
fancy-schmancy welding and painting is done? I
wouldn't be surprised if I saw it in the 2002 issue of
HotIReland Dubs magazine!


Don't be fooled folks, Keep the busses here where they
belong!!!

It was Colnel Mustard in the Study with the
candlestick!!!!!!
