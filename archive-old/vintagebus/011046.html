We in the US are suckers for brand names. We think.
for example, that Budweiser is better than Coors,
even though they are nearly identical. Half of us
think that Coke is better than Pepsi, while the
other half think the opposite. Yes there are 
differences, but it is like arguing about the
aesthetic properties of two shades of turquoise.
There is a detectable difference, but does it really
matter? But I am not saying that it never matters,
because I have eaten Food Lion macaroni and cheese.

Which gets me to parts. On many of the popular vendor
websites, you find a part listed for $X, and a similar
GERMAN part listed for $X + 25%. The implication is
that the GERMAN part is always better. Can we really
go by the reputation of a country? Could not Crapmaster
Industries open a plant in Germany and pump out stamped
pot-metal parts faster than, uh..., something than 
stamps out pot-metal parts really fast? National Pride 
notwithstanding, certainly there are some German factory 
workers willing to forsake their engineering heritage 
to make a quick Deutsch Mark. How can I tell if the
part is worth the extra money? Should I insist on 
a brand name?
