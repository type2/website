Subject: Fw: [VB] VIN Woes

Well Volks,

I got a confession . . . I already told Rachel about this.

My Swee Bus has a '63 vin on the heater channel up front, and a '66 vin stamped by the engine.  The
title has the '63 vin on it, so I bought it thinking it was a '63.  I didn't notice the discrepancy
until I went to rebuild the brakes.  The shoes were a tad bit narrower . . . yeah!  That is when I
looked at the vin's and saw the discepancy.  The PO told me he took the rag top/23 window off a
rusted '63 and put it on a decent '66.  Okay . . . where is the '66 title?  &quot;Dunno&quot; was the answer.
By then I was sweatin bullets.

I had it inspected and re-licenced long before I started messing with the brakes, so, officially, in
my name here in Ewtah, it was/is a '63.  My real sweat was if one or both were stolen.  The Ewtah
DMV did 15 western state computer search on the hot vin database and I came up clean.  . . . dry off
the forehead, whew!  Then I told them I wanted it registered as a '66 because that is what the
body/mechanical is.  They said that since I had no '66 title, I'd have to use a Ewtah produced vin
number and label, to be affixed to the driver door sill, just above the catch.  Phine.

This was after a physical inspection of the two differing vins by a Ewtah &quot;brand inspector&quot; er, &quot;vin
cop.&quot;  The said cop told me I'd have to affix the new Ewtah vin label and then call a cop to sign
off on a verification that it was affixed.  Ooookay.  I called the cops, this was last mid-Feb.  The
local yocals told me to butt out until after the Olympics were over.  Phine, I am in no hurry, got
to get the belly pans on and new tires before she rolls anyway, and Australia beckons in June.

In the mean time, between then and my trip to Australia, I done lost both the new vin paperwork and
my '63 title!  I think I will just re-register it next week, and then request a duplicate '63 title.
Maybe next year I will mess with getting the '66 title and new Ewtah vin.  I want her on the road!
