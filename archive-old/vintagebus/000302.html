Just got back from vacation, found buses without even trying. It's amazing 
how these follow you home once you have one, they keep falling in your lap.

66 21 window RUST FREE, cut divider, converted to camper with later Westy 
interior
                     still has original door panels. A very very nice bus. 
Needs sunroof         
                     mechanism, currently has a homemade poptop.Runs and 
Drives      
                     great. $7500.

66 21 window  Rust repaired, Ok job in doing so, Recent Blue and White paint, 
After              
                      market interior and carpet (pretty cheesey) Runs and 
Drives  $7500.

62 23 window  100% complete European Deluxe. Bullet front nose with larger    
 
                      taillights, no belly pans. Just like the 23 window 
deluxe in the VW      
                      museum and Franklin Mint Model. Long bumper trim (no US 
spec            
                      overriders) on front and rear bumpers. Rust in dog 
legs, rockers,                   
                      corners and nose. A real find in need of TLC and 
RESTORATION.
                       $6000.

59 23 window   Another European Deluxe. Rust in dog legs, front floors and 
rear        
                      corners. Missing back and middle seats, jailbars, 
steering wheel                   
                      and long trim on rear bumper. Crank start rear apron 
and perhaps the      
                      original engine still intact. A great buy at $3500.

54-55 Barndoor    Helping a friend sell this thing. Said to be a former Swiss 
   
                          observation bus, looks like a high roof Kombi with 
extra large        
                          windows on the area above the drip rail and a sub 
hatch on top.
                          Rear window above the rear barndoor decklid opens. 
Original   
                          engine, very little rust, no seats. A real head 
turner. Still working  
                          on a comfirmed price, should be around $7500.

Photos available on all of the above. $1.50 for color copies that I will send 
out on a first come first serve bases.

Several RHD drive buses, including a panel, kombi and what looks like a Westy 
all bullet buses!!! More info coming soon.
