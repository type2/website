Along the same lines.....                   Octobre

        About two months ago, I was over at a fellow-obsessed buddy's place
browsing his lastest rags when I came across an article that had a picture
of Jim Ellis' wife Paula Ellis (naturally).  It was something to the effect
of her winning a Chili Cook-off contest.  Without thinking, I dropped a
name (sorry Ellis').  I said, &quot;Hey....thats Paula!&quot;  All my friends looked
at me like I was &quot;hurt&quot; (hope this term isnt just Okie lingo). 

         It is amazing how after being on this LIST for awhile how you can
come to feel you know folks though you have never met them before.  Also,
were we such sticklers for correct spelling before the list or is it a
coincidence that the majority of T2'ers had a mean grand parent that beat
the dog $h!t out of us for spelling crap wrong?

        I was watching &quot;RICKY LAKE&quot; the other day and they were exposing
people to their phobias in order to cure people of them.  Maybe for the
next couple weeks, the majority of us can admit that we are anal about
spelling  and  get over it by intentionally mispelling stuff.  Maybe this
would &quot;relax&quot; the entire list and let those that are scared to post due to
the senseless ridicule that they may run into.  This way we can all blend
in.

        Congrats once again to the Ellis'!

Have a &quot;grate weak&quot;,
