Subject: OEM Tire Question..

Hi list, For last week or so, on my way to work, I've noticed a utility
trailer leaning against someones porch. I couldn't miss the old VW
wheels..and couldn't help wondering if they were some usable 15 or maybe
even..16 inch wheels. Today I checked them out, they are 15 inch, but
don't appear to be type 2. I was suprised to see a nice set of MATCHING
snow tires. I was expecting to see the name &quot;Continentel&quot; or
&quot;Motomaster&quot; (Canadian Tire)  but they just said &quot;VOLKSWAGEN CANADA&quot; in
raised letters. I didn't spend to much time there, but didn't see any
other names..Did VW have tires specially made? 

TIA
Michael Moore
