Hey all,

This past weekend, I added yet another bus to my collection.  My heart is
just too big.  ...And I have to tell the wifey she cant have any more
pets...how hypocritical I am....

Anyhow, I think it is a '58 model year bus.  I get so confused on &quot;model
year&quot; vs &quot;production year&quot;.  The chassis number is 235,199.  My notes say
this is produced in '57.   So...this makes it a '58, right?  Anyway, I
saved it at an auction.  It looks to have a better sub-frame to it than the
'64 SC that I am currently working on.  Yep...you guessed it... I am
thinking about adding the '64 to the &quot;available list&quot; and concentrating on
the '58.  Pictures of the '64 available at
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/ under &quot;Projects&quot;.  

As memory serves, the new pickup has the bigger of the small tail lights. 
It does have a small, circular, metal frame to ...possibly a
reflector?..below the regular tail lights.  I thought the light and
reflector arangement was earlier than '58.  My '58 Panel just has lights.  
BTW, what are my engine lid options here?  Are trucks one-year-onlys for
'57 &amp; '58?  Will a later pre-'67 lid fit with a corresponding apron?

I was looking at pictures of San Antonio's &quot;own&quot; Mike Gensler's '58 SC
(&quot;Zorm&quot;) the other night. 
http://lonestar.texas_dot_net/~gensler/zorm/zrm3-298.JPG  That SOB has
semaphores!  How COOL is that?......I was floored.  How did that happen?  I
knew the SC that I just got HAS to be older (older is cooler, ha, ha) than
Mike's but I guess he has an unusual deal.  I was hoping they ran sema's
later on trucks than buses.   Guess not.   Lucky Mike!

I AM tentatively planning on making  the BBB#3 thing in Lake Havasu, AZ. 
Looking forward to meeting all you Western U.S.crazies!

Thanks,
