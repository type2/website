&gt; Quick Question:  On my 58, the front doors open really far.  Like about
&gt; 110 degrees which puts them further around than sticking straight out
&gt; from the bus.  Is this the way they're supposed to be?  Or is there some
&gt; kind of stop or strap that keeps them from going to far?

my '54, '55, and '56 do the same thing.  Clara can provide
you with the chassis number, date, time of day, and ambient temperature
that they made the change... :) 

'54, '55, '56 sounds like a johnny cash song or something...

I need a '53 and a '57 now...
