Subject: sorry , I am in ohio and need a engine
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I did not include that I was in dayton ohio when I was asking about a engine 
for my single cab I would like any kind of engine with minimal run time that 
is in good shape that is all I really desire sixes and preferences are 
nothing compared to no engine at all

thanks
