Subject: 58-61 tail light markings

i met a guy locally that has some nos 58-61 tail light lenses but i noticed
that some have different markings than the others.  one style just says
&quot;Hella&quot;  in the center and underneath says &quot;SRBL17&quot; or something like that.
the set i bought from him has &quot;hella&quot; in the center and underneath has a
squiggly line followed by k13280.  around the bottom it says &quot;bs2515 grade 2&quot;.
both types had the gold paint on the back of the lenses.  can somebody fill me
in on the difference?  thanks!
