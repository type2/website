 hello
  this is the first post i have done so i hope it makes sense to all
 
 this might be an odd question but where would people suggest i look to find 
a 
 complete 1500 engine. I bought a 65 Double cab not long ago. The only thing 
 it did not come with was the engine ;  gear box,reduction boxes ,ect. is all 
 there. Ill be restoring this truck back to  original except possibly the 
 paint color , therefore id really like to find a complete 1500 rather than 
 somhow trying to find the indivdual parts. 
 does anyone have somthing such as this for sale ?  im not too concerned if 
it 
 needs to be rebuilt because of mileage , but i dont want somthing that is 
 broken from abuse .  If so, please email me 
 thank you in advance

you could probably find a core motor at a junkyard , out of a bug or 
whatever.  If you want specifically an H case, the H cases being originally 
1500 you may have to look longer.   Then again, really the A cases (such as 
AE, AK,) are a better alloy, and it is cheeaper to build a 1600 rather than 
1500 (1500 pc and cs being harder to find, and 1600 being very easy to get)  
so unless you and building a spiffy original showtruck, I would get a later 
1600 case with the dual oil relief and better alloy, and have a 1600.   Hope 
this helps some.
