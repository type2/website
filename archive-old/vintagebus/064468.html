Subject: Re: [VB] rattle ?

That sounds kinda like what my motor is doing.  I've asked like 8 people
about it, and 7 have said that's the exhaust hitting on something.  I've
looked everywhere, and it's not the exhaust.  The other person, and
professional air-cooled VW mechanic, said it was probably the cam.  Does the
rattle sound like the exhaust hitting on the bumper or some other object???
The only difference is that when I increase the RPM's only slightly, the
sound does get faster, but after like 1300-1500 RPM's, the sound of the
motor drowns it out.

&gt; again we check for the origin of the noise. no luck. it kind of sounds
like
&gt; a rattling. when i rev the motor-it does not get louder, actually the
sound
&gt; of the motor drowns it out. i am imagining i accidentally dropped a nut or
&gt; washer inside something or other, and it is getting rattled around-but it
&gt; sounds too loud for that.
