I believe what you are talking about is a 110v window style home a/c
units.This  was shown in Trends a couple years ago about our club(the DBG)
members( Keith Brick's  Doormobile from Iowa,in particular, see the latest
NEATO newsletter with recent pics)who were tired of the 100+ degree
heat at BBTA.This was obviously used only while camping and with 110
available.Keith did not remove the front slider it fits into the opening
of the open window.Quite a nice set-up ! He is presently redesigning it to
stand on its own so it doesn't contact his bus and scratch the paint ,as his
present unit can do.
    His claim is that his bus is air cooled twice !!

---------------------------------------------
&gt; A year or two ago I saw a few
&gt; photos in a hotvw mag. which were taken at some kind of event.  The pre 67
&gt; westy had a AC mounted in the right front window, the person removed the
&gt; slider glass and did some creative plywood cutting to fill around the AC.
I
&gt; think there was a strap or something that hung from the gutter rail.  Does
&gt; anybody know of this install???
