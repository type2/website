Hi all,

Thanks for the answers about parts compatibility.
I now have 2 photos of the van. It is a Kombi that's
been sitting in the woods for quite a while. All windows
are broken, rust everywhere. I'll go see it,
scrounge what is still usable and post it to the list.
Just don't put too much hope on any thing that rusts or
rot away in 15 years of snow and rain...

Please have fun
