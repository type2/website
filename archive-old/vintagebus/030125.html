George,
    I go along with your guess of New Zealand for the photo.  One big big
clue for me, a lapsed NZ resident, is that the trees in the background have
leaves on them.  All native kiwi trees are evergreen.  They keep their
leaves in the winter.  Also, there is some great skiing on both the North
and South Islands of New Zealand.  There is some skiing in Oz but nothing to
brag about.   And the bus is RHD!    Gary Gibson

&gt; &gt; It's Friday, and here's a trivia question.  Go to
&gt; &gt; http://onearth_dot_com/images/trivia.jpg
&gt; &gt; and then tell me where the picture was taken.
&gt;
&gt; Well, it's a right hand drive bus, so I assume that it is in a RHD
&gt; country.  The fellow in the picture doesn't look Japanese, so it isn't
&gt; Japan.  I don't think that they have chair lift ski resorts in the UK or
&gt; Oz, though I might be wrong.  That leaves New Zealand or perhaps South
&gt; Africa.  The bus has really wierd louvers on the side, which I think were
&gt; Australian, so my best guess would be New Zealand.  My confidence in
&gt; this guess isn't too high, though!
&gt;
