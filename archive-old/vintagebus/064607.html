Subject: Side Tent _at_ OCTO

Hello folks,

someone was selling a Westy side tent at OCTO this weekend.... anyone know who it was?  Someone on the FMBC list is looking for an original later model tent.  It was rolled up and not in a bag, as far as I remember, and like $325.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Chris
