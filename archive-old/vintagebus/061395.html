&gt; Well yesterday I was at my local junkyard and I came a cross someones old
&gt; drag bug,
&gt; the motor and tranny still there! and they look way to
&gt; clean ,there is oil in it and it looks like it was just changed too, the
&gt; motor doesn't have the cooling shroud or a alt mount(its blocked off with a
&gt; chrome plate). I can turn it over buy hand , the owner of the yard says the
&gt; old owner says it runs. My question is what are some thing I should look for
&gt; that might cause some problem .

If it's a drag motor it will be assembled to specs that will make it a
very poor engine for a bus.  Drag engines are designed to make a few
quarter-mile passes at maximum power, so they tend to run large
clearances.  Not what you want in a long-lived street engine.
