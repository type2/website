Subject: Re: [VB] Weekend salvage yard experience

I've heard of something like that done in the Porsche 
community.   It would work if you could get some cheap
space in an industrial zone.  You'd have to be pretty 
good friends, as the squabbles over space and parts could
start pretty easily.

&gt; i have been thinking of starting a kinda of junkyard/storage co-op with my
&gt; local VW club and other vw fans. the idea would be the members pay a small
&gt; fee each month to have a place to store there VW's that they find and have
&gt; no room to store it,work on them , strip them what ever. What do you guys
&gt; think? would it work?
