I have given a lot of thought on these lines also. I bought a 68 Devon
Dormobil. the bus is straight and original, but man would I like to
transplant the top and interior to my 1960 DD, i would be chastized from
here to hell by the split and the bay crowd, but I would have 1 cool very
usable camper with room to spare. I would only need to devise some kind of
hindged roof rack to carry some of my stuff.

Geez. As per my usual routine, I get home from work and check out the
list... and the Vintage Nazis are swarming like a bunch of angry fire
ants! Heh, heh!

These are the hacks I'm seriously thinking about. I want a late bay
pop-up with full size bed up top, like Richard's. A former girlfriend
has a '74 westy, and I envied the fact that she could arrive at a
campsite with a fully packed bus, and be able to crash *before*
unloading the bus. I also want a kitchenette from a Vanagon, installed
in the bulkhead behind the front bench seat. This is a very compact
arrangement with stove, sink and fridge, taking up about as much as
space as the backwards facing middle seat. This will involve cutting the
bulkhead below the bar, to accommodate the stuff that hangs out of the
back of the unit.

Reasons for doing the hack, rather than just buying a Vanagon Westy?

1) The roof had been damaged by a fallen branch, before I owned the bus.
I straightened it out to a general shape, but the skin was &quot;pinged&quot; by
the PO, apparently with a small ball peen hammer. I'll never get it
perfectly straight again, short of replacing the roof or putting lots of
Bondo over it.

2) The front end is damaged (my fault). I'll straighten it out as best
as I can, paint it to stop the rust, then mount the spare on the front.
That leaves the space behind the front seat available for the extra
space needed for the Vanagon kitchenette.

3) Mechanically, my bus is near perfect. I've rebuilt the front
suspension and steering. I've built a strong 1776 to power it. I've
replaced the tranny, but plan on having a freeway flier built for it.
Except for the tranny innards, I'm intimate with every part of this bus.
I carry a toolbox and spare parts, and I'm not afraid to drive it
anywhere.

My kids are about grown up, and I'd like to do some long distance
traveling in the next couple of years. I'm getting my bus ready for the
trip.
