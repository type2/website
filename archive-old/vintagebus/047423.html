 next step is to bleed the brakes to flush out old fluid and any water
 accumulation. Then maybe get the front drums turned and look at the shoes,
 though the shoes are probably fine as are not old.

great idea to flush out the brakes. New brake fluid extends the life of 
hydraulic parts.   But I wouldn't get the drums turned just cause, only if 
they are bad, they could get thin you know, and replacements get harder to 
find.

 About tierod ends, I could replace all of them(5or 6 right?), but it seems
 the inners are worse, though when you replace them as they are worse than
 the outers and move first, now the outers would move just as much quite
 possibly. Either way, any advice about getting the cheapest tierod/ends I
 can or getting German tierod/ends?

two tie rods each have two ends.  There is also a drag link.  I am not sure 
what you mean by the above re inners and outers, tie rods are fairly cheap.  
There is alo a drag link.  hope this helps.

 I am sure I need a seperator tool. Will anyone from discount auto do? Or
 should I get one through a VW parts/tool place? Are they usually the wedge
 type you pound? Or are they the puller type with a threaded center that
 pushes them out as you turn the center bolt thing?
 I also have a little pnuematic impact hammer with some flat bits that would
 act as a wedge. Has anyone used one of these on tierod ends before?
  &gt;&gt;

air hammers are rumoured to be good.  I tend to hit the tie rod on the side 
of the round end to make it pop out, or pry with a 6ft pipe.  there are many 
ways, just dont hit on th ethreaded part to try to pop it up, that isn't good.
