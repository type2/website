Subject: Re: [VB] NICE Shifter extension RANT!!


&gt;This is not necessarily directed at the last person to post but after reading
&gt;several responses to my original post I am very curious why so many people
&gt;**WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN MY REPRODUCTION OR TALKED TO ME ABOUT THEM** have so
&gt;much to say about them.  No, 6061 aluminum alone isn't all that exciting.
&gt;But if I had used some crap material and the extension broke on some listee
&gt;at an inopportune moment then there would be some excitement - the negative
&gt;kind.

etc, etc, ec...



&gt;
&gt;rant mode off.

I really don't know why a few (very few) mildly negative posts has caused
this type of reaction.  Maybe you just had a bad day.  All I saw was some
folks discussing the pros and cons of your shifter extensions, and without
even having one to examine.  The one guy who said he had actually seen one
had nothing but praise, and he is the only one whose words meant anything
(since the others were only speculating).  Lighten up.

I have seen those extensions go for crazy prices on Ebay.  Beat up ones go
for $20+, NOS for $40+.

I'm sending you my MO today.
