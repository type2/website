Subject: New P&amp;C

Ok feel free to flame me if this is a total FAQ, but I did search the archives
for displacement formula, P&amp;C size, etc... and came up empty.

I have a singleport out of my 67 that is in need of P&amp;C.  I checked a couple
sites and saw &quot;1600cc, Std. 85.5mm Flat, CR 7.7:1 &quot; listed for a 50 - 67 bus.
Is this correct?  Will these bolt right into my motor?  I thought the
singleport from a 67 was a 1500.  If that's true and the P&amp;C are the same size
what makes it smaller than a 1600, the crank stroke?

I guess my ramblings could be summed up into two questions:
What size P&amp;C came in a stock 67?
What size P&amp;C can be used without case modification?

Thanks!
Mike
