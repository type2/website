&gt; I started playing with the throttle, and noticed that as I pulled it down, 
&gt; gas immediately appeared on the surface of a small round &quot;plug&quot; directly in 
&gt; front of  
&gt; me, and on both sides of carb on the nuts at the end of the shaft that  
&gt; the throttle pivots on. 

Hi Don,
The plug is a problem that might be solved by center punching around the hole 
in the body.  If that does not work you can remove the plug and thread in an 
old spark plug into the hole!  We have seen this work well with a past carb we 
just smashed/cut off the top of the spark plug to keep someone from hooking a 
plug wire to it!
  As for the fuel coming out either end of the lower butterfly valve that is 
normal if the engine is not running and you have pumped the carb.  This sprays 
fuel down the carb and if the accelerator pump nozzle is not aimed properly 
and if the butterfly is not held open long enough the fuel sits on top of the 
valve and seeps out the cross shaft that the valve mounts in.
