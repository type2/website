Subject: RE: [VB] RATBASTARDS

&gt; because Bin Laden sees us as all economic fighters
&gt; against his people.... what are WE going to do about it..?


There are two interesting articles linked from CNN_dot_com's main page today....

The one that really raised my eyebrows indicates that the Taliban may
(perhaps) be starting to lose its control over Afghanistan, due to
members'/supporters' fear of US attack, with the possibility of the country
descending into anarchy.

The second explains rather concisely why so many in that region hate us in
the first place.
