My first response when I see that someone took a VW out of MY state is one
of, &quot;How in the hell did I miss that one?&quot;  There are a bunch of us VW nuts
in SE Nebraska and when a VW comes up for sale, word usually spreads pretty
darn fast.  Consider yourself lucky that you made it here and back without
being accosted by any of us. :-)

Actually, I'm thrilled that you got a bus.  Welcome to the club!  I'm more
disappointed that you didn't look any of us up so we could meet you or even
help out, have supper, etc.  I was in Lincoln Saturday night myself.

Happy bussing man!
