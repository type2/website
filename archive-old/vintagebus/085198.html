Subject: Link to a German auto search site

Short story made shorter... I have a neighbor who is from Germany and he has
always scoffed at my bus '63 and my SC truck '59.  He simply can't understand
why I would spend time on these 'junkyard' vehicles.  When he was growing up,
these were worthless and you could get one on every corner... if they were
still functional.  Most were in junkyards.  Rough suggestion from him... &quot;They
are so abundant in Germany that I should just fly there, get 2 or 3 of them
from a junkyard and then built up something much better.&quot;

Well, I challenged him to find some pictures of these so called 'junkyard'
vehicles that are so abundant.  He came back with a few pictures from a search
engine:  http://www.autoscout24_dot_de/

It turns out these are not so much junkyard vehicles, but there are some
fairly nice bus's for sale... including a firetruck bus I ran across while
checking it out.  Anyhoo, check out the link, if you read deutsch, it might be
easier, but I don't and could figure it out pretty easily.

Enjoy.

P.S.  Anyone got a thermostat for a single port 1600 bug engine I can buy?
P-mail me if you do.
