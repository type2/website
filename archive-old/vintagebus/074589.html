&gt;..... So, what do you get for a 44 year old double cab for it's birthday?
 I thought I would have Eric (my painter
&gt; friend) paint some flames on the narrowed spring plates for the double
&gt; cab. dove blue flames of course on the black plate, maybe a little bit
&gt; of pearl but I'll leave that up to Eric that likes to do flames.
&gt; . Flame suit on :-).......

You are really looking for trouble, aren't you? Is this a midlife crisis

Tom Buese-got enough trouble w/o baiting the list or maybe I don't
