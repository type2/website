Subject: Re: [VB] Hope for the next generation

&gt; I thought everyone on the list would enjoy hearing that at my son's high
&gt; school, our 1966 Westfalia was recently voted &quot;coolest car&quot; in a student
&gt; body poll conducted by his school newspaper.

Ditto this. I used to attend a trade school auto body repair program. When I
would bring my T3, or crewcab or bug into class to do some work on it, all
the &quot;20 ish&quot; school kids there would flock around my cars ohhing and ahhing
about how cool it was. Invariably, I would here the comment: &quot;I'm going to
get one of those someday&quot; or &quot;do you know anybody that has one of those for
sale?&quot;

I guess Ferdinand had it all going on there.
