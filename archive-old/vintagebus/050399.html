There was some discussion a few days back on Type II towbars.  Myself and a friend have put together a towbar for my 59 singlecab.  As you can see in the pictures it attaches at the same point as the bumper.  We are leaning toward this design due to the fact it limits the potential damage down by other types of tow devices.  If anyone is interested, we are going to put a few together to sell at local shows this summer and on the Internet.
