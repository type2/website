Subject: Re: [T2] heater knob question

Hi,

I understand now but am a little worried about this setup. The 
squirrel cage blowers form 72 up buses only pushed air through the 
system when the engine was turning at low rpm such as idling at a 
stop light or warming up. Once the fan on the end of the crankshaft 
starting spinning at about 1500 RPM it created enough pressure to 
overcome the squirrel cage fan an close the flaps in the housing. 
When rpm dropped again the flaps would open and the squirrel cage fan 
took over again.

Granted that a stock upright motor turning 900 rpm at idle does not 
move much air through the stock system but when it gets in the 3300 
rpm range ( top of all gears) it is really moving much more air then 
the two squirrel cages do. You might be doing well at idle but will 
be cheated when the bus is moving.

Additionally, the stock heating system performs a cooling function. 
As the RPMs increase, the fan moves more air through the heater boxes 
and into the bus or out of the mushrooms on the heater boxes. That 
keeps the heater boxes from accumulating too much heat and 
transferring it to the heads. With variable flow of air cut off and 
replaced with a constant low flow your head temp and consequently oil 
temp will go up. Is this a problem in the dead of winter? Not sure 
but you may want to invest the $15 dollars so in the Gene Berg 
dipstick temp sensor that replaces your dipstick and hooks up to your 
oil pressure switch. It will make your oil light flicker when your 
oil temp hits 225 degrees which means your heads are quickly leaving 
the happy zone.

One trick to assist in defrosting is to slightly open the passenger 
side vent wing window. Having the window open allow the air from the 
heating system to flow faster allowing the envelope of the bus to 
breath. I know that sounds crazy but it really works :)

Good luck
Chris

&gt;Sorry, about that cryptic sentence--a picture or a
&gt;sketch would help. I speak of the holes that come out
&gt;of the fan housing's sheet metal that the stock 2&quot;
&gt;flex hoses take into the heater boxes. I took the flex
&gt;hoses off and covered the holes with aluminum tape.
&gt;Now, the aux. blowers push the air through the heater
&gt;boxes.
