Subject: Re: [VB] Some guy's pictures/ mystery problem solved

Your right, i shouldnt have typed it like that. Was just making an observation on the file names.
One cool thing on his site i did see was if you go to his domain name and go into the &quot;scam&quot;
section, theres a couple cool things in there.

Bus content- Was working on someones VW, would run great then it would die a few minutes or so
minutes after driving it. Would start back up but would bog out if you try to rev it up. If you let
it sit for a few minutes wether idling or shutoff - then it would run fine again until the next time
it randomly happened then the process would begin all over again. Pump was working good, filter was
full, still seemed like a fuel issue. Had already went thru the carb, everything looked great,
reassembled. I eventually figured out that the cut off valve that the float pushes on in his 30pict3
was sticking closed at random intervals. Replaced it and runs perfect now. Just something to file
away in the troubleshooting files!
