It really sucked that I had to work this weekend but I had committed myself
to subbing for a workmate of mine.  I was able to get a meager amount of
work done in the evenings but nowhere near what I wanted.

I put in the new jets in the 40IDF's that Ronnie so graciously sent me from
Kymco.  He put up with a lot crap from me by my incessant phone calling
until I could get in touch with him.  I can't thank the guys at
www.kymcovw_dot_com enough.  If you ever need Weber carb help, get in touch with
Ronnie - he's got the knowledge.

Anyway, I need to add oil to my 1776 so I ran out to Walmart and got a case
of it.  Then I dorked around with things like adding oil, hooking up the
fuel line, pulling the plugs to crank the engine and build OP, and that sort
of thing.  When the moment of truth came, I cranked about 3 times and she
coughed and sputtered and sprang to life with a nice slow idle.  I started
messing with my new synchrometer tool and man is that thing nice.  It's
really THE tool for syncing Webers and worth every bit of the $64 I had to
give for it.  Never once did it choke off the cylinder and it held a very
steady reading on the guage.  Absolutely enjoyable and smooth to work with.
It's like comparing a proper sized wrench to a vise grip, a screw driver to
a hunk of thin metal, and a hammer compared to a hunk of brick - you can get
the job done easier with one than the other.

After syncing up the carbs, I hooked my linkage back up, fired her up and
there she sat at a nice low and steady idle.  The biggest change I've
noticed is the more pronounced sound from the carbs now that I'm flowing
better.  It's got that nice throaty holler that says, &quot;GIVE ME MORE FUEL -
GIVE ME MORE POWER!&quot; :-)  I revved her up a couple of times and got all
giddy so I shut her down and ran in here to make this post. :-)

There's no doubt about it - the 1st 2 things you should get when
contemplating an engine rebuild is a forged counterweighted crank and an
expensive set of heads.  The rest you can sort of cheap out on if you have
to.

I get Tuesday off from work so the plan is to install the engine Monday
night and then Tuesday I'll be hooking up my 3.5qt sump, oil temp sender
unit, and hopefully as time allows, the EMPEG player with amp and speakers.
Then it'll be the mad rush to start packing for the trip to BNNTA.

I'm stoked!!!
