I believe C Dreike (?) in So. Calif. was looking for a door post for a
64-67??
I was down south in Ontario, Calif. for the past 4 days for training for
work and in my free time I visited all the local self serve wrecking
yards.:) I just can't seem to pass them up.... I found a 66 Standard, 226xxx
xxx, with very few parts left on it. Not a walk-thru. Still has most of the
engine and the transaxle in it. The only door left is the right front
because it's bent. However both front pillars are still there and in very
good condition.
It is at Pick a Part in Riverside. Go out 60 past Ontario and get off at
Pyrite St. The yard is on the north side of the freeway on the side of the
hill. It was called Hillside Auto Wrecking....kinda fitting....now it is
Pick a Part but the workers still wear Hillside uniforms....
