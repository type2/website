hey all,
i got some headlight assemblys this weekend and want to get the real
light switch working. i am assuming though that it doesn't work or it
would be connected. (yes, i did try hooking it up) i got al the wires
figured out except the grey one hooked up at 5 o'clock (if you are
looking at the back of the switch) is there a different switch for 6V
and 12V? that is probably why it's not working. there is a $.99
toggle working the lights now and i would like the parking lights and
dash lights to work too! i've gone through all my parts catalogs and
stuff and no switches. any ideas... an extra switch out there??
thanks a heap!
