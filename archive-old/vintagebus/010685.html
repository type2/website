&lt;&lt; Do you guys with roof racks park in garages? Seems like it'd be too tall
 for the door. How about carports? I want to &quot;look coool&quot; with my wood slat
 roof rack, but doesn't make sense if I can't pull in the garage at night.

I guess it would depend on the structure , my carport is high enough for my 
59 with a steel rack elevated about 8 inches off the ground, but myold 67' 
pop westy wouldnt fit a garage because of the pop top. I guess you could 
measure from the rain gutter to the top of the garage door opening and then 
measure potential racks from the feet to the top rail.
