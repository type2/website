Hi Matthew,
Okay!  You can go out and buy a tap to do that.  Go ahead and buy the 
slightly priceier HSS tap not the cheaper one that crack and break off too 
easily.  Or if the threads are not too bad off and it is more of a 
paint/dirst and slightly damaged thread deal take a look at an engine tin 
self cleaning screw.  Then go get out or buy a bolt for this hole and 
file/hack saw a notch into the bolt simular to the one in most engine screws!
