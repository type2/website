Subject: Re: [VB] Drunk Driver Convicted

If the judicial systems n Canada and the U.S. had any balls they would 
take the one great law from Saudia Arabia. When a person is caught, and 
has been driving drunk, at the seen of an accident after such a horrific 
incident such as this, a bullet from a revolver is put into there head. 
No jury, no waist of money, eccept for the 70 cents for the bullet, 
situation resolved. No more drunk driver only body in body bag. I don't 
fully beleive in capital punishment but in situations like this or clear 
cut cases like Jeffrey Dahlmer use bullets it just right.
