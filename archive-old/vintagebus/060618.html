&lt;&lt; I have completely the wrong switch and knob then - it was very cheap 
anyway!
 
 Is the knob for a 66 the same size and shape as the rest of the knobs or
 just the same shape?
 =============
it is about the same shap and size as the other dash knobs

in the 66, the knob flashes, as the flashers flash, or maybe alternately with 
them.

The BRL on the dash in the 65 and earliers flash alternately with the e 
flashers, at least in my 65
