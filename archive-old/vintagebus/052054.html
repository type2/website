  &gt;  Will the pump rod I have work for either type of
  &gt; pump?
  
  Has anyone mentioned on this thread that a poor
  quality pump rod can wear to the point that the pump
  isn't being actuated sufficiently?  Good pump rods
  will have a definite pointy/hardened lower end.
  
  Also, I check a pump by pulling the nuts off, cranking
  the engine manually so the rod is at it's highest
  point, and pushing the pump down on the rod.  You
  don't have to completely remove it to perform this
  maneuver.
