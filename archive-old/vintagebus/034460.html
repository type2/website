  Hi everyone,
  
  I just got a VERY complete set of 32-PDSIT dual carbs w/ matching dizzy
  in suprizingly good condition and was wondering if anyone out there has
  ever fitted them to a 1500/1600 upright engine before??  After I took
  them home, I sat behind my bus with the engine lid open looking and
  trying to figure out what would need to be fabricated in order to
  physically install them on my bus.  Obviously I would need to weld up
  two new manifolds to fit my heads and would also need to move over the
  tab where the throttle cable attaches about 4&quot; (and possibly shorten
  the rod).  So what else am I missing??  Would these carbs be worth the
  work to get them to fit or would it be better to just use ICT's or
  another aftermarket carb set??  
  
  I'm currently using a 30PICT-1 and have no real complaints with it's
  performance and milage (currently 24.2 mpg).  I just like to tinker and
  make non-perminant, easy to return to original changes to see what the
  performance might be like if. . . (READ: I can't leave well enough
  alone ;-) )  Well there you have it.  Any opinions/experience with
  this??

Nate,

If you want duals, I suggest you sell the 34PDSIT 2/3's to a 'loaf owner and 
use the money to fabricate a pair of manifolds that will accept the 28 or 30 
PICT.

If you weld and have access to a mock-up engine, you can fabricate such a 
manifold by salvaging a pair of stock SP manifolds.

For SP heads you need to add a strut to help support the carb.  Use the 
threaded boss just forward of the inlet orifice but be sure to make it 
demountable -- it gets in the way of the #2 spark plug.  With DP heads, you 
will need to fabricate the entire thing.  The size and contacting surface 
make it strong enough so you won't need the strut.  Slicing sections out of 
pre-bent exhaust tubing using a plasma cutter is the fastest way (for me :-)

Making up the linkage calls for some fiddly work (and that on the carbs you 
have isn't any better).  The trick is to have the carbs FACE each other.  
Positioned in that fashion, the throttle(s) will actuate on a PULL.  You then 
fabricate a T-bar arrangement, similar to what VW used on the dual-carb 
1500's.  Be sure to position the carbs far enough toward the rear of the 
vehicle -- they must clear the blower housing (see the curves on the 
single-carb manifold.  Make it like that.)  You must provide a balance tube 
between the manifolds.  Shop for a pair of early sedan oil-bath air-cleaners. 
 If you position the carbs properly, they will not interfer with the blower 
housing.  (See the early Okrassa dual-carb set-ups.)  Don't trust your engine 
to a paper or foam filter unless you have proof the thing actually works.  
Most after-market air-filters are a joke.)

You will need to change the vacuum canister on your distributor to the 
'small-signal' type (ie, larger canister).  See the can used on the stock 
dual-carb VW engines.  The myth that you must run a -009 with dual carbs is 
just that -- another myth.  VW used a vacuum-advance mechanism with its 
dual-carb engines.  Follow their lead.

- ----------------------------

There are many reasons for my suggesting you go this route rather than trying 
to use the  34-PDSIT-2/3's but the most obvious is the arcane low-speed 
circuit.  This calls for a SEPERATE MANIFOLD... that's that piece of pipe 
that connects to the left carb (ie, the one having the low-speed circuit) to 
the 'distribution chamber' and from the distribution chamber to each of the 
manifolds BELOW the throttle-plate.  

This unusual system is a reflection of VW's failed attempts to lower the 
emissions of its air-cooled engines.  

Other factors are cost &amp; availability of repair parts for these carbs.

Properly set up, dual carbs can improve the volumetric efficiency of your 
engine.  But they add to the complexity and provide little benefit on the 
top-end, unless you go through the entire induction/exhaust system -- from 
cam to flywheel :-)

Good luck with it.
