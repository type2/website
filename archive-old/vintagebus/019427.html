Just wanted to say thanks to those who responded to my wanted request the other day. 

But, as always there is something else I could use (like everyone).  I need the triangle air cleaner bracket for a 40 hp motor.  It is the one on page 17 (section K-2) in the Bentley.  The brackets mounts to the fan housing and the coil mounts on top of it.

Thanks.


Steve
