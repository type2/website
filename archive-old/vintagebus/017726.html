Easy! A person or two could always walk over to the
Hertz counter and rent an SUv and sleep in the cheap
seats spaz parking lot. Next year they could
hypothetically plan ahead and hoof it to the orgy, er,
I mean charity event in a splittie bus.
KJ&gt; What time is the Caravan leaving for Jerome 
From Pheonix?? 
BK&gt;&gt; Phoenix is spelled with the O first and then the
E. Dont ask me I've only been here since '56 and it
still seems weird. Why dont we call it Faux-eenix?
Dunno. 7 AM.
KJ&gt; Could a person get a ride back to the airport? 
BK&gt;&gt; Yeah and return the rental SUV and drive out of
town in the raffle bus. schwing! =)

thanks 
sincerly Kirin Jacobsen
