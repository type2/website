It sure looks like Sea Blue to me.  It was also used on Ghias.  Here's a
recent picture of my '66 Ghia cabrio, in it's original color, L360 Sea Blue:

&gt;Hello, Knowledgeable Ones!
&gt;
&gt;I must admit...I am a little confused.  Today, yet another VW person
&gt;responded to my using the term &quot;Sea Blue&quot; with &quot;...oh, the bug color?&quot;  And
&gt;I must admit, after looking through the vintagebus_dot_com registry, that the
&gt;color swatches next to the many buses that had Sea Blue as part of their
&gt;makeup looked nothing like what I am calling Sea Blue....nor did the color
&gt;of the sample in a recent VW mag....
&gt;
&gt;I have never seen a bus with this color!  And I find it strange that no-one
&gt;on the list seems to have a digital photo or the location (URL) of a pic
&gt;with such a bus.  SO.  I ask you if you would be so kind as to check out the
&gt;one pic at the following address....is the bug (which I miss very much) Sea
&gt;Blue or not?  If not, well, what is it?
