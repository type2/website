&lt;&lt; ??? All pancake dist. clamps point to the right, passenger side. If you

in front of the dist. If it went to the left rear, you couldn't get to it, 
the fan housing blocks it. &gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
Thanks for the correction.  We were only able to find one picture of the 
distributor on the type 4.  It seems to show that the clamping area actually 
is center of forward, but has a extra long bolt out to the right to tighten 
it up.  There are all sorts of clamps out there for all of the air cooled 
engines which means all sorts of possible mistakes to later cause a mess 
setting the distributor properly.   Eric&amp;Barb
