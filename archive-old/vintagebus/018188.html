Subject: Re: [VB] nomenclature, was brake lights

my single cab's park lights up front don't work at all.  i just need to hook 'em up... i think.  anyway what i'm gathering from this discussion is that early type 2s ran both headlights and park lights.  since i also have type 1s i started to think about how their park/headlights work.  my oval beetle's park lights used to blink off when the headlights were on but don't now.  i've been told this might be a switch problem.  (i'd like to think that it wants to please me by acting more like a bus.)  the '58 ghia also has it's park lights separate from the headlights, meaning that the park lights (bullets) turn off when the headlights are on.  is it fruitless to wonder why vw would set up the park/headlights different between the types?
