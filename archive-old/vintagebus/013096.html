I have a '75 Westy Campmobile that I am looking to sell. I found a
Studebaker that I want, so as long as the Stude is for sale (i.e.
noone else buys it), the Westy is BEST OFFER...MONEY TALKS

See an ad at this address:

Local delivery or south of Gainesville since thats where the
Studebaker is.
David
