 Well it seems that I have to get rid of heater boxes with performance heads
 in order to prevent overheating.  Can anyone shed some light on what I could
 do in order to get a performance head but still run my heaterboxes and not
 worry about overheating?  I gotta get to bed.  Talk to you all later...
