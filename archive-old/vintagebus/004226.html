I bought a set of these and didn't have the &quot;brass&quot; to use them.
I figured they would be too stiff and either be noisier or possibly
cause problems.I've always used the German rubber ones and found they last
about 20,000 miles(USING a camber compensator).They should last longer in
stock format.
    Have you been using urethane ones ?
    Anyone?

 The install without taking out the trans. is a fun one.;-)
  count your fingers.

&gt; Might I suggest the urethane ones instead of the rubber?  Urethane works
so
&gt; much better anyways in this application I've found.  &gt; NQ
