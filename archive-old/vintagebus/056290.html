Subject: Re: [VB] Drop Spindle Installation?

I used stock pins, but still cannot use the dustcaps at all because of
clearance, and if I'm not mistaken, the side that used to have the dust cap,
is now on the inside of the spindle.

I have no experience with repo pins, so I didn't know the heads were
thicker.  I don't think if you removed a 1/16 of an inch to clearance the
pins (on the spindle side, or maybe even the pins themselves), you would
lose any strength.  It's pretty thick back there.

Later

Subject: [VB] Drop Spindle Installation?


&gt; Anyone had trouble installing Drop Spindles?  Here's the head I'm
&gt; having; With replacement Link Pins (which head is twice the thickness)
&gt; the head of the Top Pin catches on the Spindle.  I can take out 3 shims
&gt; and it will fit.  With my offset Bentley calls for 6 on the outside (Pin
&gt; Head side) and 2 inside.  Even with that you'd never get a dust cap in
&gt; there.  Now the old, stock Pin, will work with the Setup, but still no
&gt; dust cap?  Has anyone else experienced this problem?
&gt;
&gt; How important is it t keep the Right amount of shims on the outside
&gt; (Pin's head side)?
&gt;
