Subject: Re: [VB] Source for ceiling panels

I have seen rust encourage by the spray foam, by fluffy insulation packed 
into spaces, and by the squishy foam insulation- which acts as a sponge and 
literally was wet to the touch glued to the ceiling inside a bus from 
dragging water from the air. 

I used the shiny bubble wrap stuff you can buy in rolls from home depot, with 
the concept that it would not in of itself retain water.    Cut they to shape 
with a pair of scirrors- real easy to work with. I used a couple layers above 
the head.

&gt; Anyone ever used the Foam insulation.  Seems that would be better and not
&gt;  hold moisture.

&gt;  
&gt;  &gt; Be careful if you are using home insulation on a bus.
&gt;  &gt; I have a remarkably rust free midwest bus that I am
&gt;  &gt; restoring.  The only major rust was in the doors and
&gt;  &gt; it was caused by moisture held in by the pink
&gt;  &gt; fiberglass insulation.  Any insulation should be
&gt;  &gt; attached to the inner door panels and not the metal.
