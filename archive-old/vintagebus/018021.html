Same goes with wives (or husbands, as the case may
be)! My wife Suzy, while she's never been
super-excited about my hobby, sewed an entire interior
for a '71 Super Beetle (
http://www.geocities_dot_com/ignatius.geo/super.html ),
goes to the occasional show and meeting, is officially
co-president of the local VW club, and can do brakes
and knows most of the mechanical quirks of various
models of aircooled VW. She also has named all of our
V-dubs.

Of course, it probably didn't hurt that she owned a
Scirocco in her youth, and her Dad is a former
Karmann-Ghia owner, and her older sister drove a Super
Beetle for about 5 years.

&gt; &gt; Moral of the story: Let the kids help, start them
&gt; &gt; young, even if they make mistakes; keep them
&gt; &gt; interested

&gt; My older daughter (5 years old) can
&gt; tell the difference between a barndoor and a
&gt; non-barndoor bus, as well as super vs. standard bug.
&gt; 
&gt; She knows the difference between a &quot;double&quot; and
&gt; &quot;single&quot; cab, as well as what those words mean.
