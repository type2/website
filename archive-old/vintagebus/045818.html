&lt;&lt; I could be wrong but don't barndoor beams use bushings instead of 
bearings??
 Clara, E+B, where's the books when you need them &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
Pretty sure you are corrcect!  Our APR58 bus shop parts book does not go into 
detail about the earlier front beam.  Recently we inquired about new link 
pins for 1964-67 bus from a fellow in Brazil.  Turns out they use a brass 
bushing not the expensive long lasting needle bearings we are used to!
