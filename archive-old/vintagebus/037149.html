I have TWO transaxles with big nut reduction gears for sale.  One trans ('64) 
is bad but has good big nut boxes, the other trans ('67) ran when parked and 
should be good all the way through.  Will sell complete, box to box for core 
charge ($75 &amp; $150)  Both are located just off of I-70 near Kansas City 
Missouri.

Please Pmail me if you are interested.
