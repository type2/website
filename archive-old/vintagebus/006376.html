Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;F&quot;'d up setting my end play

I had a problem setting my endplay as well.  I took my engine to the local
guru and he said that first of all, the shims needed to be bone dry with no
grease or oil on them.  That was my first mistake.  Second mistake was that
I had the main seal in.  I make sure the seal is removed and then I can get
a really accurate measurement on the endplay.
