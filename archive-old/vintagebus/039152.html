I had a friend in high school that was talking about doing this.  I think he did it but don't remember the results.  I think the idea is that the water vapor expands more than air, but it is really late and I am really tired.  I should look it up tomorrow just for grins.

I was reading through my old Hot VW's and found in June 1981 a section
on building a &quot;water injection system&quot; for an aircooled vw engine.

Anyone ever heard of this? Done this?
