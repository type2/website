Wow. I'm wondering then if they were all top over bottom I was sure the
white over velvet green deluxe hardtop I had was white under green

    &gt; I think in the last round we figured out that there was a time in the
    &gt; early 60's when the two tones were done top first then bottom. In any
    &gt; case, 

    &gt;I know that my original paint '65 deluxe was painted bottom first,
    &gt; then top. There's lots of SWR showing through the BG on my roof.

This is a good example and goes against what I said earlier. I stand corrected.

Notice the red showing through the BG on top.

    &gt; This is another thing the old workers would know. It might have been
    &gt; decided by whoever was the boss at the time. Or maybe some newly hired
    &gt; engineer was trying to save a few pfinnig on paint by changing things
    &gt; around.

I thought for sure white was under color but I'm wondering if they ever
did switch and maybe what I was seeing coming through the bottom color
of light on dark colored early buses was primer and not BG.
