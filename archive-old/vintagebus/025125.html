&gt; ok yes its screwed on PHILLIPS HEAD.  unless some jackass added some
&gt; flatheads.  but the BIGGEST THING! is DO NOT get frustrated and start PULLING
&gt; IT OFF.  you will bend and crease the piss out of it.  if its in the junkyard
&gt; not EVERY screw will come out most likely the screw heads are RUSTED to piss.
