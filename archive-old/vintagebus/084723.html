Subject: RE: [VB] Was location, now 5AFN370

 yours obviously a
Westfalia-built camper or could it have been built by another
manufacturer?  There were several other camper-builders in California at
the time

Definately not Westfalia, some bits were in the style of a Westfalia but the
overall quality was poor.  Add that to many years of abuse and I really
srarted with an empty shell.
