Maybe you have some sheet metal on the engine that is
resonating at a certain frequency/rpm. Possibly some other
part of the bus is doing same.
Check the generator/alternator bearings. Belt tension. Is
this an SC? check out the tool compartments.

&gt; Remember a while back when I posted about a strange noise
coming from the
&gt; transaxle?  It was a rattle at certain RPM's when I let
off the throttle.
&gt;
&gt; This weekend I replaced the transmission.  The noise is
still there, 'cept
&gt; now it seems to do it when I accellerate, too.  The noise
seems more muted
&gt; that it was before.  I replaced the front mount when I did
the
&gt; transmission, so that may have something to do with it.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
