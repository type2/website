Thanks for the suggestion; I'll follow through on it tomorrow. Yours is
the best suggestion I've had. We drove the bus in question to Kelley
Park (390 miles round trip). I love the bus and the only real rust area
are the floors. Your philosophy matches mine: the next owner can always
repair the job properly and in the meantime I keep it on the road.

&gt; I understand the need to save coin, go get some rust mort (yes it really
&gt; works)about 1 tenth the price of por 15, go to autozone and get a fiberglass
&gt; repair kit and patch it, you'll always be able to cut it out and repair it
&gt; properly down the road, keep them on the road
