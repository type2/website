Subject: Re: [VB] Window replcement

the westy louvered windows are put in teh same size holes at the pop out, but 
AFAIK the westies don't have the hinges.  Yes pop out need hinges to pop out 
and not fall out.  (unless you have new seals in which case forget about 
opening teh windows for a years)  So you could try to find hinges and weld 
them into your bus.  Then you need to weld in the plate with the threaded 
holes for the latch.

  On the other hand, you could find solid glass and it'd fit in w/o a problem.

&lt;&lt; Can louvered westy windows be changed back to pop outs. I really don't 
 like the look of louvered windows and would like to change them. If 
 anyone knows the answer or has tried this I would like to know.
 
 Thanks
