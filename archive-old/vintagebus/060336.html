Subject: Re: [VB] Im back...but with some new toys


&gt; Hello everyone...Im back on the list after being cut off many months back
&gt; because of my email filling up. I was getting into my Studebakers, so I
just
&gt; stayed off.

We knew youd come back...they always do....WB

&gt; Anyways, its good to be back on the VB list and I hope I can find the
parts
&gt; my buddy needs for his 63 Crew (hint hint). Im also on the lookout for a
&gt; crewcab, even if its a baywindow. I have another friend thats looking for
&gt; the a treasure chest door for his 64(?) single cab.
Try my Truck classifieds at http://dropgates_dot_com or  the classys at
http://thesamba_dot_com or the auctions at http://vintagebus_dot_com

&gt; Did all single cabs have two treasure chest doors ?
No. It was an mcode option (071). Market was flooded with 071's around 1962
but has been seen on a few trucks as early as 56.
