I agree with Eric ... this sounds like your intake or carb isn't properly
matched to your engine.  ((There is still a rather large question in my mind
as to the compression ration that these Beetlemex longblocks are coming
with.  As I've posted earlier, there have beny many net references to a
Mexican longblock &quot;export&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot; CR.  As I understand it, gas in
Mexico is worse than the stuff we have in the USA.))

With your Beetlemex -- did you go the Hydraulic or solid lifters?  I'm
surprised about the valves not being complete, my Beetlemex longblock (solid
lifters) was just like any other standard longblock.  The only surprise was
the lack of hole for the thermostat, but as I posted earlier -- it did have
the Boss and I did drill it without issue.

Frankly -- it sounds too late, but at the time where you discovered the tin
was missing thermostat and the odd carb -- might have returned it in favor
of just getting a longblock and using traditional bits.

I am interested in hearing more about this oddball Bocar carb.  Any chance
we can get a photo of it?
