My last bus was custom painted with bright
yellow over dark blue.  Unfortunately the putz
PO didn't pay attention to the original paint
color boundaries.

Couple of pointers, Get to know exactly where
the stock paint colors meet.  The PO of this
bus didn't.  Some of the errors: Used the trim
to hide the paint joint, stock joint was just
below the trim, the door jambs should be painted
to match the exterior color, so one doesn't see
the contrasting color.  In my case the yellow
interior/top could be seen between the door and
jamb, looked bad, I fixed it a bit with a rattle
can.  Very annoying that the PO didn't know 
where the paint was supposed to meet.

Pay close attention to this stuff, it'll make
for a miuch better paint job.  Make notes, take
pictures before, search out stock busses.  It
just didn't look right with the joint under the
trim.

An important note, try to stick with
a stock interior paint color and headliner
material.  Interior panels are easy to change,
but paint and headliner are not.

Mine was totally black inside, and would be VERY
difficult to change without totally tearing the
whole interior out, including the $headliner$.
Made it too dark.

Exterior painting would be much easier to 
re-do in the future if tastes change.
