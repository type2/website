Subject: Grey gutter gunk?

Hello...

I am very sore now because I have been scraping a Volkswagen.  That is, I
have removed the rest of the paint from the roof of our '66 Westy, using
&quot;Citrustrip&quot; stripper and a blade from a wood plane.  I wasn't intending to
go to the metal, but as I discovered more rust, I just went for it.  Strange
how rust can show up underneath paint! I got to the sanding point, and as
the light faded away, I metal-prepped the roof and sprayed on 2.5 cans of
Extend.  I'll let y'all know what I think of Extend in a couple years....

Anyway, I am asking this:  Did VW put that grey gunk in the gutters to seal
the seam between roof and gutter?  If so, should I replace it?  With what?

Later,

Gene

P.S.  I will get better mileage and be able to go faster with the weight of
four layers of paint off of the bus!
