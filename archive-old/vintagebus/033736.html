  There are 2 ways or maybe 3 to go. I have  many people on the list with
the BRAND NEW Mexican long blocks. I can easily see 50,000 plus miles out of
a well maintained NEW engine. The most miles I know of on one is a little
over 40,000 (in 3 or so years)and this one has duel Kadrons and 1.25 ratio
rockers in a 64 21 window Deluxe driven daily. George Lyle has one in his
bay and you have read of his trips, as does Chuck in Reno, who takes very
long goad trips in his bus. There is also one in my old side loader that
came out of my DD panel and it had a little more then 30,000 miles on it
when I put it in the side loader.
  I currently run a 1776 single port with duel Kadrons and love it, it's
been trouble free for over 14,000 miles now (except for the broken Berg
valve adjuster, 80 miles from nowhere).
  When I get the time I will assemble my new engine, Brazil/Brazil AS 41
case cut to accept cut-in 88's, 74 stroke DPR welded crank, Scat H beam
stroker rods, CB 2239 cam, german lightened cam followers, CB filter pump,
041 duel port heads with Manley valves, high rev springs, chromolly
retainers and keepers, chromlly pushrods with Scat ball end adjusters. All
componenta are fully balanced and semi blueprinted, type 3 tight finned oil
cooler, no flaps, CE big tube heater boxes with SS header with a hidaway
Turbo (not a Thom) muffler. When complete I will dyno this engine (just got
a VW dyno in town) to see what HP and torque it puts out and make
adjustments from there. Would prefer to put single port heads but I only
have 1 NOS single port (German) head left.

Volks,
I think that question was: &gt;&gt;who makes the best &quot;turn-key&quot; motors? and what
should we be looking for in that motor?&lt;&lt;  pretty sure of that since I will
be in the market for a brand new engine soon too and was interested to hear
opinions....
1776cc dream with everything new german if possible.....with all the bells
and whistles....

Ronnie? you're selling motors too... any opinions?

&gt; &gt;1776cc
&gt;
&gt; I think I agree. They really do work!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;single or dual port heads (whatever tickles your fancy)
&gt; &gt;single heavy duty valve springs
&gt; &gt;stock cam
&gt;
&gt; Or at maybe a engle 110. Counterwieghted. Not a bad idea!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;stock intake/oil bath/stock exhaust with heater boxes
&gt; Of course!
&gt; &gt;vacuum advance dizzy
&gt; &gt;solid rocker shafts/swivel feet adjusters
&gt; Not a bad idea at all.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;doghouse
&gt; &gt;compufire drop-in module
&gt; &gt;full flow with Berg oil lines
&gt;
&gt; And maybe a high flow oil pump.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;balance it, too
&gt;
&gt; Thats the real deal. Any engine built by you should be balanced.
&gt;
&gt; You would like this engine, it will give new life to that bus feeling.
&gt;
&gt; Jason.
