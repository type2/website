I respectfully disagree.  Anytime one of us that gets slimed like Larry did, 
SHOULD, by all means speak up so no one else gets screwed.  Not only should 
warnings like this include individuals like Mr Shepard, but also any 
piss-poor service or inferior products by any of the major vendors out there 
as well.  

Bottom Line:  Mr Shepard stole $65 bucks from Larry--that's not dirty 
laundry; that's mail fraud. Questions?
