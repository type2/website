When I bought my '67 Westy in 1990, I pulled the paneling behind the table in search of a faulty interior light wire, and behind it I found a weathered note saying &quot;Sean was here - 1975.&quot; Don't know what Sean was doing under there (or even who he was - he wasn't the guy I bought it from), but I thought it was a cool idea. Sort of a time capsule. I also found a 1968 penny under the driver's seat that was crusted onto the metal as if it had been there since then. Kind of a neat idea to leave a little note when working somewhere that won't be touched for many years...just so the next owner (if there ever is one) can find it in the future.

&gt; On a whim I took out my roof panels in the camper today.  They were really
&gt; starting to show their age, sagging in places and so forth.  So I'm
&gt; stacking things gently in the backyard when I notice things written on the
&gt; 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 48&quot; support pieces (of wood).  It's hard to describe how the 2nd
