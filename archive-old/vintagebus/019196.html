&quot;&quot;My bus is still iced in, I plan on getting  out my
oxy-acetylene
setup this morning to thaw her out. It's kind of like
that crew
on the Discovery Channel who found that WW II bomber
under
the ice and brought her back to the surface.

Careful with that torch, remember what happened to
that WWII Bomber that was dug out of the ice?
