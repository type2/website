&lt;&lt; I am working on a 1965 bus
 
 As to the Transmission fluid change, I see two hex nuts on the bottom of the
engine, I assume these are to drain the transmission fluid.  My question is
where to put the new fluid in.   &gt;&gt;

The plug is located on the left side of the transmission if you are looking at
it from the rear
of the bus. I't's that big allen key thingy.
