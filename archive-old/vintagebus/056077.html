Hello All

Well my new '67 bus (bought it Tuesday) won't start.  I have gone =
through the
archives and library.  In reading what I found I have 2 questions I =
could
sure use some help on;

1 Where do you find one of the preconfigured Bosch bypass relay kits (or
does anyone have a part #) that attaches to the starter solenoid? This =
is described in the library section.

2 Diagnosis help. My problem does not seem to be described in all that I
have read.  My starter turns, but disengages almost immediatley.  I =
would
guess the engines makes 1 or 2 quick revolutions at most, not long =
enough to
fire. Battery is Ok, as I have the same experience when I jumped it. =
Also
the generater light does not dim when I go to start.  Does this sound =
like a
connection problem or more like a starter/solenoid problem?

Thanks!! I really need to get the bus going soon.

Bob
