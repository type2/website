Subject: BYOB'03 - Ummmm, tomorrow!

Hey everyone,

This is the last time I'll bug you all about BYOB.  It's tomorrow.  8am - 1pm.  Big ole 
swap and a good sized show.  Yes, we're expecting wet weather, so come prepared.  
Yes, I said come to the show...we're rain or shine!  

Flyer: http://www.sv2s_dot_com/users/siliconvalleychapter/byob.html

Gate Info: For people wanting to show up tonight, the Red Barn had officially set the gate 
closure time this year at 8pm.  There's a good chance we can keep it open until 10pm, 
but always expect the unexpected in VW-land.  If nothing else, we're aiming to keep the 
dirt parking lot open for people showing up after gate time.  So you should have a place 
to crash out overnight.  As always, we can't totally guarantee this, so be ready for 
anything.

Remember that all the buses parked inside the gate on Saturday, whether you're 
showing or swapping, are eligible for awards!

If anyone has email questions, I'll be doing my last email check at about 2.15pm today.  
After that, I'll be on my way there.

-Taylor
