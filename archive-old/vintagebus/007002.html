lay the wheel on the ground, drive over the tire to break the bead, turn
over do the same, get a couple of large screwdrivers (I have tire spoons)
and dismount the tire. POC

Anyone ever remove their own tires?  I've got a set of rims that I want 
to get blasted .  They've got bald tires on them I don't care to lose 
but don't feel it necessary to shell out $5 a rim for a shop to just 
dismount.  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut=
the tires off?  Could it be that
simple?  tia
