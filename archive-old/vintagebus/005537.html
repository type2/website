When I mentioned videos, I wasn't talking MPEG.  The fastest way to become
disappointed with a video or audio project is to commit it to digital.  It
all ends up there eventually, and even regular video is &quot;digital&quot; in a way,
but what I really had in mind was to have people send in well-executed or at
least (hopefully) interesting home videos on tape.  Where do they send them
in?  Well, now, if that ain't the crux of the nub....I was hopin' that
someone with too much time on their hands and a video editing setup would
take up the challenge.  I would, but I don't have the gear it would take to
make it work.  Just like Sam's making it happen with the calendar, someone
would have to take the responsibility for editing and general audio/video
layout, and then duplication.  Not a small or easy job...or cheap.....maybe
we could call it a VWmentary and Discovery Channel would cover the costs.
Otherwise, we'd have to get pledges from folks on the list, and that would
probably cover the duplication, anyway....

&gt; &gt; Videos would be interesting but much more difficult.  I would favor
&gt; pictoral
&gt; &gt; spreads in detail for technical stuff in a step by step approach.  Offer
a
&gt; &gt; summary of the article with list member rating of what they saw and zip
it
&gt; &gt; for download to save locally to conserve on bandwidth from repeated
&gt; &gt; accesses.  However, there is something to be said for a
discussion/lecture
&gt; &gt; approach which could offer much more depth that a pictoral method.
&gt; &gt; Definitely something to think about!!
