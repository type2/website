&lt;&lt;  Any advise before I head out in a couple weeks or for along the way would 
be a great help.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chester,
Warm clothing, and even more importantly, enough blankets/sleeping bag to 
keep warm in freezing weather just in case you get stuck in the middle of 
nowhere.  Canned or dried food to cover you for a couple of days.  Studded 
snow tires are a good idea, and chains if they will fit in your buses rear 
wheelwells with the size tires you are running.  Most of all figure out where 
the worse mountian passes are in your path and try to time it so you attempt 
them between 1200-1600 hours which is the warmest time of the day to increase 
the chances of you getting through.
