Subject: Re: [VB] Tap vs. Drill size chart

Thanks for your reply,
I must remark how impressed I am with this web site to hear from South Africa. It is cool to communicate from Monterey, California.

&gt; Hello, Conrad and greetings from a spring-time South Africa! 
&gt; 
&gt; We were told in our mechanical appreticeship to simply calculate the 
&gt; screw/bolt diameter by 0.8! This would give you the core-hole. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, by example, a 6mm bolt has a hole drilled of 4,8mm...a 5mm srew/bolt has 
&gt; an inner diameter of 4.0mm 
&gt; 
&gt; I still find this very helpful, if you would have a broken off srew and want 
&gt; to drill it out... 
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy your weekend!
