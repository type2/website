This mess that VWOA has gotten in with messing with enthusiasts'
websites really needs to be viewed with the perspective that
the www.Ford-Trucks_dot_com website is not only still running, it
is a great site, is on Ford's list for news releases, new models,
and general PR from Ford.  Far be it to be lackeys for Ford, 
there are links to the unauthorized and subversive sites that
describe hidden recalls also.  The site was the first to show
that Ford had a fix for a door crack problem that 90% of dealers
didn't even know about until copies of the notice from Ford were
presented to them that were found on the web. 

This is how VWOA should be treating VW related websites, with
direct communication and involvement, not wholesale shut downs.
It is a real shame to alienate enthusiasts.

Enough.
