Subject: nobody's seen her!

Wow, I am assuming by the torrent of e-mails cramming my mailbox (actually
zero, nada) that nobody has heard of that 63 Kombi with the ambulance
goodies in it. Gosh, there must be all of 1 or 2 busses out there to fit
that description. My only conclusion now is that the new owner probably got
caught in a good cross-wind (needed new pitman arm) or stepped on the
grabbing breaks on his maiden voyage on the way home, and wrecked it. (How
depressing!) More optimistically, I am hoping it is being lovingly restored
in a garage somewhere, and the owner is not online.

On another note, I have located a 69 type-2 DC here on Pender Island, with a
fair amount of rot in the frame. A small discussion with previous owner (not
the current owner)leads me to the information that he has already bought the
replacement metal and has it on hand for whoever buys it off this other
guy... and, that there is another type-2 DC here on our little Island which
would be a good complimentary parts bus!  Things are coming together fast.

I have decided that since there is a *small* amount of modifications going
on for an EV conversion, I will stay away from split-windows, so someone can
do a proper resto on it. I will stay on this list (also joined T-2 list),
though, b/c there is so much resto info going on which will be relevant.
Thanks (in advance, even)to all the knowledgable people who are so generous
with what they know.

Ben
