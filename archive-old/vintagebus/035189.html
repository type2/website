Subject: Brake reservoir

Well I changed the old slipping master cylinder this weekend.  Went better
than I thought it would for an old rusty master cylinder...  Well thanks to
PB Blaster penetrating oil :)   I dowsed it for a week before turning the
brake line screws.  Once it was out I took the brake fluid reservoir off and
cleaned it up really well and wire wheeled the threads to the reservoir
where it screws into the new master cylinder.

The only issue now is that once it was reinstalled there is a very small
leak coming from the joining of the brake fluid reservoir and the master
cylinder... Maybe I should have left the threads dirty for sealant :)  Yes,
I reused the aluminum washer that was originally there.  Maybe I should take
the reservoir off and seal it with Loc-Tite?  I am not sure what is a good
sealant since brake fluid is like toxic waste?

BTW I got a vacuum pump from Sears and it is a wonderful way to bleed brake
solo style.  Highly recommend this tool.

Thanks,
