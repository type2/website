I cant say right off how much oil the redux boxes hold, BUT! 

Whatever oil you put in, you want to be SURE that it does NOT meet the
GL-5 specification.  YOu want a GL-4 rated gear oil.  The GL-5 oils (which
list that they meet GL-4 specs, which they do..they exceed them) contain
to much sulfur for the types of metal that are in your transaxle and redux
boxes.  

If the bottle has GL-5 on it, DO NOT USE IT.  Continue to look until you
find a oil that the highest GL rating is GL-4.  Pep Boys carries a
Sta-Lube oil that is appropriate for our cause.   And, dont listen to the
guys at the counter thta tell you that Gl-5 is fine.  Check the archives
on this, even Valvoline has pulbications stating .not. to use GL-5 oils in
transaxles requiring GL-4.


good luck.
