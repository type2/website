ok....i have to agree with DuvBlau and the other people. there is support for
hacking up buses for no real reason , when you can just go out and buy a 23
window. as Mike said, alot of projects are left for dead for lack of interest
once its half way through. but when it comes to lowering, thats &quot;ruining&quot; a
bus?? i think not...my bus is lowered WITH IRS suspension, the road handling
is incredible and i DONT have bearing problems,as ive driven this bus all over
the country , logged about 40,000 miles on the bearings.still going strong!!!
and i am the one who drove from NC (Blue Ridge campout) to Florida with tons
of stuff inside the bus including a full Camper interior and the rack topped
off at about 4 feet high of parts, not once did the tires rub with 2 people in
it to boot!! now im wondering why its so wrong to have IRS and lower the bus ,
when its perfectly ok to junk buses and hack up some models to &quot;make&quot; another
model..

just my 2 cents....concerned of the hipocracy
