&gt;and finally a big fat Dubie from 1967!! (NOT ! just kiddin' :-)


Heh Heh!  When I sold my 71 Westy to Jason Saltzman, he told that when he
was cleaning it out, he dug out really good under seats (where my hands
couldn't reach) and he pulled out a dope pipe.  And this was for real.  I
can only imagine the fun I would have experienced had the police had the
drug dog come in. :-)
