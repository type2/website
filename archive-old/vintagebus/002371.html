I for one haven't had the time. Started to reroof my house 2 months ago and
&quot;might&quot; get started actually putting roofing on this weekend. And I thought
the bus hobby was pricey. What a nightmare. It is nearing the end though,
and I hope to be spewing my normal quota of bull again soon. Maybe the time
is ripe for a nice lowering thread.

&gt;    Is our beloved Vintagebus list dying?  There seems to be less and less
&gt; messages, very few road trip stories and there seems to be little if any
&gt; good conflicts going on.
