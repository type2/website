We have always camped out behind the fair grounds on the west side. We
have never been hassled back there, but I do not know of the legality
of it. Two years ago we camped next to these guys who made a rather
large fire and got completely loaded. No one came even then. I will be
out there in the 57 23 Window or the tan 60 Double Cab. There is a
small chance I will have the 73 Thing but it will probably be one of
the two busses. There should be at least two other cars with our club.
Probably a 65 Standard Sunroof, and either a 59 23 Window or a new
Beetle. Hope to see you there.
