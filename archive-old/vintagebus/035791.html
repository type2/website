&lt;&lt; This may seem like a lunkheaded question, but, what is the 
 preferred mirror on a splitty bus, elephant ear style or round? I see enough 
 of both and I can't figure out which one. &gt;&gt;
Hi Justyn,
There really is no right or preferred mirror.  The buses from at least 
1955-67 came from the factory with only the round driver mirror.  Anything 
else would be an aftermarket or dealer accessory.  On trucks that use the 
tilt or panel vans having the passenger mirror is a must in our opinion and 
having the elephant mirrors is nice to see more in your blind spot on the 
passengerside.  The only thing we did not like with the elephant mirrors is 
that they tend to wiggle far more at high speeds giving a blurred image.  
There were at least three Euro accessory mirrors and three USA accessory 
mirrors that we know of and one mirror sold in the late 1950s that we only 
have a discription of having a visor on it!   Eric&amp;Barb
