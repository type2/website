Subject: RPM.s and road speed

 Boy I am now puzzled.
 
I have a new speedometer that looks wonderful, rebuilt by someone who Peninsula automotive in Campbell uses. But I seem to go slower for the RPM's that mt tachometer shows.
I have a 63 singlecab with the 1 ton option (one year only rear brake drums etc...). I have a big nut tranny with 205x15 tyres, and I thought I could fly on the freeway, but maybe the gearing in the speddo head is different.
I now show 4200 RPM at 60 moh on the freeway. I have not gone to a calibrated stretch to find out what my real speed is, and I want to get a GPS system to check the ground speed but Santa has not heard of that yet.
 
I realise that I should not cruise over 4000 RPM and some people say 3500 RPM. Are there different gearing or springs that go in 63 type 2 speedometers? Or should I really limit my speed to 59 mph as the manual says?
