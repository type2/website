Bus-snob writ:
&gt;including (oh god, here comes the grief) the BMW says &quot;AS-1&quot;. (yes, I
bought a BMW 2002 last week.)&lt;

Wow, I did not know that the 2002 year models were out yet!  I can see the
DINKs lining up out side the showroom now!    

...  Or is that a 2002 model :)  Great green house windows that make for
easy vision out all over.  Now you know those can be easily hopped up and
raced on the weekends :)   Muuuuhahaha

I am not sure what that part is in front of the engine that holds the green
fluid though...  I overheard someone calling it a &quot;radiation&quot; or something
like that, better be careful, they apparently explode if you take the cap
off it when hot.   Much too dangerous for me, I will stick to the
air-coolers :)
