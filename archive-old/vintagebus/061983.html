Subject: Re: [VB] Re:HELP in Amirillo Texas 

Ronnie tipped me off on the guys problem. Amarillo is way far from me...in 
fact I think Alburque, NM and Oklahoma City might be closer! But I think I 
found some help for them to some degree.

What I was told was a local shop up there wanted to charge $500 for a used 
tranny! One of the locals I sent their way says that's because the sandrail 
guys up there are driving up the market on those things. It's a TX thing I 
guess!

Anyway, Jim O'Malley of VW's in Film and Video website fame offered up his 
Super Beetle for parts running and his carport and what tools he has for 
working. Jerry a local Baja guy is gonna go over and find them and try to 
help as well. He's anxious to see the Roadcow in person. Hopefully help 
will continue to roll in until they are on the road again. I'll keep 
sending people their way until that time comes.

Britt did say they broke down right in front of the Big Texan 
Steakhouse...which has 72 ounce steaks or something. So maybe they'll at 
least eat good tonight!
