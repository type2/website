&lt;&lt; I too have spoken with the &quot;sphincter&quot; at oregon performance&gt;&gt;

Well, at least he got 'sphincter' spelled correctly. 

This is the same kind of attitude that irritated Bob Hoover
enough for him to yank the Sermons.  What used to be
a free resource now is $19.95.  Joe's a business man, just 
like me, who has to balance making a living with giving his
time away answering questions.  

Time is money.   

If you have intelligent, well thought out questions then you
can be sure that you will get intelligent, well thought out 
answers.   See Scott Fraser's post on this.   See the
Thing mailing list on this as well.  On the other hand, if 
you're just too lazy to look up the information yourself 
and want him to do your leg work for you then, knowing 
Joe like I do,  expect to be told to go piss in a pot.  
  
For example, should someone occupy my time when I 
could be finishing up a transaxle and getting paid because 
they don't understand the difference between the early and
late style throw-out bearings don't expect me to be all 
'happy-happy, joy-joy' about it either.  That time represents 
food on the table.   But if they ask me a question that 
shows that they have done some research and are having
difficulty understanding how it works, show a willingness
to learn and 'respect' the time that I have to take to help 
them on their educational quest, then I am more than 
willing assist in any way I can.  Joe is the same way. 

Sure, Joe's a ol' crusty Italian who came out of retirement
to do this- so what??  Deal with it, get a life, drive on, but 
don't talk like that about someone behind their back. Thats 
just as rude as what you are claiming he was to you.  He 
isn't even on the list so he can defend himself.  

If you have a legitimate unresolved problem with someone's 
product and you are asked your opinion then feel free to 
give it to whomever is asking for it.   Calling people names
on the list because your feelings got hurt will only influence 
how other people react to your future postings and whether 
they take you seriously or not.  You like people saying 
nasty things about you?   

Next!
