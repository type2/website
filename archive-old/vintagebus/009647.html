you may just have a set of studs that have been
tweaked. The threads may be pulled, etc. 10mm aren't the most desireable
studs, but have you tried replacing them?

I had mentioned that if 8mm he could have a set of studs that have been
stretched, but didn't think it would be so likely on 10mm studs.  Do 10mm
studs get stretched like 8mm ones?    If so then they could be stretching
when they get hot, but not pulling back in when the engine cools.  It didn't
sound like they were coming out on the case side?
