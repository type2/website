Well, there's a couple of possibilities here.  First, as suggested by
someone else, you could have oil from the engine or transmission on
the clutch, which is reducing the available friction and allowing it
to spin.  That would mean replacing the friction plate and cleaning up
the pressure plate at the least, and (preferably) also replacing
whichever seal is failing.

However, it seems quite suspicious that this happened right after you
adjusted the clutch.  I would first check to see if you over-adjusted,
so that the clutch is never fully engaging.  The clutch cable should
have just a little slack in it when you aren't pressing on the pedal,
and should move the arm on the transmission well forward when you
press the pedal to the floor (not sure how much, I'd estimate it at
four or five centimeters).

Wouldn't hurt to look for oil hanging out at the base of the bell
housing, or at the very front of the bottom of the engine (front is
towards the front of the vehicle).  If you've got appreciable oil
there, and it's not obviously coming from farther back on the engine,
then you've probably got a leak you'll need to deal with.  But playing
with the cable adjust is by far the easier first step.
