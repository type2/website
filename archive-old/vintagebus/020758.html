Subject: Re: Drink holders, Hula girls, and stuff

  I'll be fabbing a drink holder in the shape of my 
double cab out of acrylic. Its got a toungue on it that 
will slide between the bottom and backrest to keep it in 
place. Two inserts that will flip to hold soda cans or 
Big Gulp cup or baby bottle here soon.
  You can find the Hula girls at 
http://shrunkenheads_dot_com They are made out of resin and 
are much more lifelike (risque) than my old girl whose 
grass skirt got burned off in the CA central valley sun 
(her spring was showing!). Thanks for the lead on that 
Erin (my wife hates it, so you know its a cool guy 
thing).
  I'll post pictures when I get it all together- Hula 
girl, new radio smack am/fm cassette, drink holder, 
LUXURY!!! 

BTW- Anyone know how long it takes to process NEATO 
membership? I bought one at OCTO 6/9/01 and have yet to 
hear/receive anything...I'm starting to get flashbacks 
of S*T*!
