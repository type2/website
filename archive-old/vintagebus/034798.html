with all this talk regarding 2 tone buses and which color was painted first, 
could it be possible, since there appear to be busses painted both ways (top 
first Vs. bottom first), that some colors covered better than others?  As 
strange as it may sound, maybe the light colors covered the dark colors 
better than vice versa? 

Our bus, originally blue white over velvet green is, as far as I can tell, 
totally green with the white painted over it.  David's bus, painted the 
opposite way, has beige covering red.  2 instances of a lighter color 
covering a darker one.

also on a Side note, could it be possible that VW said &quot;Today we're painting 
velvet green, line up all the buses that need velvet green (no matter where 
then need it, top only, bottom only, entire bus) and we'll paint.&quot;  This 
could account for some buses being painted the entire top color first and 
some being painted the entire bottom color first.

What we'd need to find is 2 same color, original paint buses that were 
painted in different manners.  One had the top color sprayed first and the 
other had the bottom color painted first

Just a thought
