&gt;&gt; If you're really sure that the far right fuse is good, look at the top

&gt;
&gt;Speaking of that big fat red wire, recently I've had my front kick panels
&gt;off (fancy simulated wood grain paneling) and have temporarily been taking
&gt;that wire off of the fuse block as an paranoid anti theft measure.  I plan
&gt;to install a kill switch.  should I wire it to that main hot, 

No.  That wire has a fair amount of juice going through it and it would
take a rather beefy switch.  I'd figure it could have up to 75% or so
of the total fused loads, plus some things that aren't fused.  If you
have eight 8-amp fuses that's 0.75 * 8 * 8 or 48 amps and change.  It's
hard to find a switch that will handle that rating *at DC*.  Heck, a
50 amp AC switch isn't that easy to come by.  Plus, the switch will add
a bit of voltage drop, which will affect everything on the Bus.

&gt;or take out the ignition switch and wire it to that?

That's a better idea.  If you take the wire off the 30 terminal on the 
ignition switch and put your kill switch in that, it'll still need to
be beefy but not as much as 48 amps.  You could also wire a kill switch
in line with circuit 50, which just keeps the starter from working...
someone could conceivably push it, though.  Probably the best place
to put it is at the wire that goes back to the coil - if you have
about a '63 through '65, this is one of the black wire at the top of the
second fuse from the right.  There are two black wires here...one comes
from #15 on the ignition switch and the other goes back to the coil.
Doing this takes the brake light and idiot light load off your switch.
Don't forget the wiring diagrams at vintagebus_dot_com .

&gt;What have people done in the past.

At the fire department we used to have master kill switches on everything,
wired into the negative battery lead usually.  This wasn't for theft so
much as it was for preventing drains on the battery - despite my many
efforts, the electrical systems of thirty year old deuce-and-a-half 
trucks WILL find a way to misbehave from time to time.  These switches
are *beefy* and will set you back $40 or $50 at NAPA.  Don't ask at
Auto Zone, Pep Boys, etc...they don't have them.  On a Bus, I'd probably
put it in the engine compartment and wire it into the battery negative
lead - shortest distance, least voltage drop.  They are made to mount
through the body but for the Bus I would just fab a bracket and attach
it to an odd corner of the engine compartment.  

This and a locking engine compartment would be decent security, but you'd
have to go to the back of the Bus to turn the switch on and off.  One
idea would be to try and rig a mechanical cable to the switch lever,
like the heater cable or clutch cable, so you can operate it with a
control in the cab (appropriately labeled &quot;gas heater&quot; or something
innocuous).

A friend with a much newer F_at_rd van sometimes takes the fuel pump relay
with him when he has to park it in a &quot;questionable&quot; area.  Of course
splitties don't have fuel pump relays, but if you have installed a
hot start relay, taking that with you might be a good idea.  You may
need to make up a harness for it, like with a four-wire trailer
connector, so it is quick to remove and replace.

If somebody *really* wants your Bus they will get it.  You don't have
to make your Bus theft-*proof*, but you just have to make it 
theft-*resistant* enough that the bad guys will just move to something
easier.  If you can, park next to the brand new BMWs, Porsches, etc.
