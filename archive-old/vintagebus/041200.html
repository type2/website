I should be there picking up my 61 panel.I hope to see some of you there.

                                    woody
ps. and the foods on Lenny.

&gt; This was sent to me from the transporter Garden.  Stop whining about KP
and come to OC and get your fix this weekend.  See you there...oh wait, no
one on the list ever talks to each other at events I forgot.  Never mind,
I'll just walk by you and not say hello like everyone else does at every
other meet ;-)  Just kidding!!  I'll be driving my pearl 62 DC with the blk
on yellow commercial plates stop and say hi.
