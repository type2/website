The next thing happening was the compression check; on review of our
hero's trip notes, after 50 or so miles post tightening,  the  readings
were 150 psi hot, in all four holes. With an eye on the oil, fuel filter
and gas tank level (especially the gas as the reserve was stuck) he split
Florida, never to return not even for his alma mater's  graduation
ceremony.

Chapter 3
About one mile past a Mississippi flying &quot;J&quot; truck stop blue smoke was
pouring out of the exhaust. &quot;Probably a hole in the # 3 piston&quot;, he
thought.

Any good way to safely get the reserve unstuck?
what caused the hole in the piston? cold air from the loose and now
tightened head cracking it? or the stuck exhaust? is there such a thing
as a early distributor with a  vacuum retard?  Our hero has no note of
denotation or pinging the head looked in fine shape.
