&lt;&lt;  I'm going to have to thru my redux boxes soon and am 
almost appalled at how  much I can tie up just in bearings.&gt;&gt;

and- 

&lt;&lt; Is there anyone on the list that works at a bearing 
company that get a few bearings for a discount price?  &gt;&gt;

Actually for retail the prices weren't too bad.  I called a
Big-Time bearing house last summer and gave them these
part numbers and asked for prices.  For the lower outer 
roller bearing I was quoted $92 over the counter and the
other ball bearings were more expensive than the quotes
I got today.  Same manufacturer but much higher prices.
 
 &lt;&lt; I agree that with a bazillion Japanese cars out there
 all running Japanese bearings, they can't be that bad. &gt;&gt;

I've got 250,000 miles on an '85 Nissan pickup with the 
original wheel bearings.  

 &lt;&lt; Do T2  bearings cross ref with any bearing for another 
application that is  considered &quot;not foreign?&quot; &gt;&gt;  

See below for the 'universal bearing numbers'

With much thanks to Eric (of Eric and Barb fame) I got the
early bearing part numbers.

For the 55-63 non-1 ton rated reduction gearboxes he has
3 of  # 311-501-283 and 1 of  # 211-501-285.  He also stated
that from the info that he has the pre-'55s also take the same
bearings as the 55-63's.  

Way back when dinosaurs roamed the earth I used to work
in a Bearing supply house.  One of my favorite things to do
was when the counter was slow and an 'old-timer' came in 
looking for bearings for the 1930 La Salle or similar old  
American Iron would be to casually mention that did he know
that the bearings he was purchasing were metric. &quot;No way!&quot; 
he'd say red-faced, &quot;This here's an 'merican car!  It ain't no 
stinkin' VW!&quot;  To which I'd reply &quot;What about all those 
bombing raids to Dusseldorf during the Big One to wipe out 
the ball bearing plants?  Where do you think these bearings 
were made back then?  Pittsburgh?&quot;  This would get him all 
spun up, of course.  Like I said, when the front counter was 
slow and you had that certain type of customer........
 
Anyway, one of the things I did was to check the back of 
the bearing catalogs for the cross-reference section.  All
bearings are made to an international standard and given
an universal number.  This number tells you the ID, the OD
the thickness, how many balls it has, is it shielded, or 
sealed, on how many sides, etc.  So for your viewing pleasure
these are the numbers that you can use at your local bearing
supply house to get what you need.  

311-501-283  is a 6306 ball bearing
211-501-285  is a 6305 ball bearing
211-501-283  is a N207E roller bearing

If there is no shaft tolerance number then it is a 'C3' fit.  
(Which is what you want anyway)  But if you are asked 
then tell them C3.  That simply signifies how tight the 
bearing will fit onto the shaft.   So, for example, if you 
have a '66 and need all the bearings for only one redux
box then tell them you need (2) 6306, (1) 6305, and (1)
N207E.  The counter guy (gal) will know exactly what
those bearings are and you don't have to try and explain
what they fit.  Also, specify brand.  If you don't then they
will just grab the first ones out of the box and you may
end up with 'Wang Chung' bearings.  Now, a 6306 is 
supposed to be a 6306 whichever brand due to international
standards but I'd try and stay with either the German or
at least Japanese.  There are also American brands but
the biggest supplier that I ran across was L&amp;S.  We didn't
call them 'Loose' and 'Sloppy' for nothing!  If you stay 
SKF or FAG regardless of country of origin then you'll be
just fine and dandy.

Will keep looking to see if I can get prices down even further.  
For those of you that posted to me that you wanted a kit or 
two I'll get with you later as soon as I can get some final 
quotes from my vendors.
