This is something that I have wondered about but never asked anyone.  I
noticed that the lock covers on pre '66 engine covers and single cab tool
chest doors are stamped metal and have a real cheap feel to them.  Were the
original parts made the same way?  Also what kind of locks did post '65
single cabs have on the tool chest doors?
