NatureWe have a 67' bus that the heat does not work in.  The engine is
pulled and i want to know if i can remove the heater boxes without messing
anything else up.  Or do I have to keep them, i was thinking about putting J
pipes.  I noticed if i do this we loose the bottom cover of sheet metal.
Should i just leave the heater boxes on?
