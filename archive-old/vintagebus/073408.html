Subject: [VB] RE: 60 sc sighting for sale in CT

Don -

That looks awfully familiar to this:
http://www.copleymotorcars_dot_com/vw_drop_side_pickup1_11.1vo254.html

same mileage too &amp; with same fresh engine rebuild ( Bob Donalds )

although could be two of a kind

A $19,500 you should have no problem convincing your wife you can afford it.

I rode by on my bicycle one day and almost crashed - this is the kind of place that has ferrari's 

He has had it for awhile ( maybe he is associated with that place in Portland f40 is a ferrari right?)
