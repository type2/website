  Well it all started on Thursday, after getting my bus road worthy and
loaded for the 2 shows, helping Carl from West Virginia (moved to Cali after
BBB V) fix his bus, I hit the road. No problems till I was about 100 miles
from Havasu when clank, tap, tap, tap. Pulled over to the side of the road
to listen and sounded like a loose rocker. Popped off the valve cover to
find one of my BERG valve adjusting screws had broken at the NUT!. For the
first time I didn't load my extra rocker assembly, bummer. After trying to
mickey it together to get to anywhere but the side of the freeway, it didn't
work, so to the cell phone I went. I called my wife and a friend of ours and
her drove out with 5 sets of rocker assemblies from the shop to get me on
the road. After a nice 2 1/2 hour nap, they showed up and 5 minutes later I
was driving again. Damn aftermarket parts. Arrived in Mohave (2:45 AM) to
find VW Howard in a dive, and I mean dive hotel to spend the night, but a
warm room and decent bed felt good.
  The rest of the drive was uneventful, arriving at RB at around 2 p.m.
being the first to arrive along with everywhere Ed who we found on the road
on the way up. Set up my canopy being it was pouring rain and waited for
others to arrive. Nobody seemed to be coming, then around 5 p.m. they
started showing up and continued all night long. If Ellis would have been
there I think he would have killed someone being his Jerome buddy, screaming
at 2 a.m. and music till 4 was there. It seemed my canopy turned out to be
LISTY central (12 at 1 point) as it kept everyone out of the rain, with
flaming BBQ coals as our heater, till Jethro (Split Bus Club) showed with
his propane heater ala VW Howard warmer (he'll tell the story).
  From there on to Kelly Park has been told, so I won't say much, except it
was smooth and easy and they did a great job on getting people in and having
the swap in the lower parking was the best thing that happened yet, thanks
for the rain.
  Vw Howard and I bailed out of KP around 1 PM as we had a long drive home
and wanted to do some hunting on the way. We found a 60 Double Cab, 59
Camper (not westy) but with a westy rack on it), a extremely hacked 67
Sundial, original owner asking price $8000.00 dollars, looked at a few other
buses we already knew about and a few other trinkets and goodies along the
way. We spent approx. 12 hours on the road Monday, but it was worth it,
looking and driving through some beautiful areas.
  So it's back to business and all I can say is it was a great weekend,
thanks to all I met finally and those I already know.

ps. I did get a yellow and gray Westy tent for my Westy and a Red and white
stripped sundial tent for my DD, look for it with tents on both sides now.
More Tents for sale at RB/KP at fair prices then I have ever seen anywhere.
