valve. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
The problem with this test is that the throttle shaft bores are not 
completely air or liquid tight even when the carb is brand new.  When the 
carb is set to idle the throttle butterfly valve is actually closed!  This 
causes any fuel being dumped by the acellerator pump onto the butterfly valve 
and like any liquid the gas wants to find anyway out and downward.  Which 
while the engine is off is easily out the throttle valve shaft bores in the 
carb due to being blocked by butterfly valve.     Eric&amp;Barb

PS you might want to check the accelerator pump linkage.  On later models you 
can adjust the when and how much the fuel is sprayed by this mechanism.  Also 
adjust the position of the nozzle to spray just between the rear edge of the 
butterfly valve as it just opens from the carb throat to avoid gas sitting on 
top or spattering on top of the butterfly valve.   EEE&amp;B
