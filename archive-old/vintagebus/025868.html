&lt;&lt; you could install a CD changer that uses low power FM broadcast  &gt;&gt;
    Actually, I've done this twice now,once in the Chevy and lastly in the 70 
westy.
Changer snuggled nicely under the jumpseat and wiring run under the carpet so 
no holes. Preset the station and your good to go with the remote. Sadly this 
8 track is an indash, left the really cool pioneer under the seat of the last 
dune buggy ** years ago. Boy did it have to be loud to hear it over pipes and 
a canvas top. I think I'll stick with the 10 cd changer and remote
