 This thing has been all over the east coast a couple times now from
 Carolinas to Key West to Canada to the Midwest and Back.
 
 I suggest if anyone still cares about it that you box it up and ship it
 out west to Ariz or Cali. Unless we are lucky enought to get one of the
 oft-long distance guys from NEATO to take it out there.

someone could hand it off at the BBB
