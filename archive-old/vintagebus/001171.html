Hi All,
As I'm going over the 59 double cab after being blasted, I have noticed a
few filled in holes (~1/8 inch in diameter) near the top outside lip of the
rear gate....   The hoop rings (or whatever you call them) are there and
then a single hole half way between each loop at about the same horizontal
plane...

Are they supposed to be there???  and if so, for what?

Thanks
Dave
