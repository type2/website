&gt; &gt; make sure the grommets are in place for the lines/hoses that run
through
&gt; &gt; metal.
&gt; 
&gt; Forget the grommet!  Split three inches of rubber VW fuel line down
its
&gt; length and snap onto the metal line where it goes thru the metal tin
&gt; piece.

An even better way is to take a strip of inner-tube rubber about 3
inches wide and wrap it around the metal gas tubing.  Keep wrapping
until the OD of the wrap is slightly larger than the hole that used to
have the grommet.  Cut the rubber to this length, and push it through
the hole.  This way has no air leaks, no vibration, no possibility of
it falling off or moving out of place.  I've done it this way for
years and never had to replace a strip.
