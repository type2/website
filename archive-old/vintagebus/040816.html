Here is how we did it, about 6 months on the road.
Get tickets to a really big event, like say the '84 Olympics in LA,
find a fiancée, both fed up with jobs, ask for leave of absence,
they say no, I say bye!

Buy and prep bus, get married and leave in the bus.  Drive for
about 20K miles.  Be stupid and not carry medical insurance, no
probs tho, be smart and do carry AAA, only needed AAA when the
after we rolled the bus to get back on wheels and towed out,
kept driving.

Spent about ~$10 per week on campgrounds, for the showers,
otherwise camped free.  Stay away from restaurants.  Our big
expense was film, we had 7 cameras between the 2 of us.  Took
many years to process them all (used the fridge for the film
and overnighted back to parents to keep in freezer).

Return to somewhere and decide where to go look for jobs.
Spend the next three months living in campground in bus
looking for job, answering service for phone messages and
mailbox at campground.

Had no unemployment, 'cause we quit.  Had a blast, wouldn't
want to trade it for anything.

Jeff  bussless but . . . . . maybe after the kids are older
