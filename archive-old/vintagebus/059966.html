Subject: Re: [VB] anti-seize on lug nuts?

OK then, how about this. Did you polish the flange on the wheel and the lug down to bare metal and
try the anti-seize?

BTW, next time the list does a caravan to the moon, I want to go.

Steve, I wish it was that simple. As I previously said, several people on
the list thought that might have been the problem with my powder coated
rims, but that didn't explain the problem with the factory painted rims. And
yes, I did wipe a thin coat along the bottom of the lug bolt flange surface.
Hmmm, I'm beginning to start thinking like one of those people that think we
never went to the moon, or the hollow earth crowd.
