&lt;&lt; When painting axle tubes, is it wise to stop the paint right where the 
axle boot would begin?  Possibly preventing problems with the axle boot 
sealing to the tube?&gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Under the boot should not matter as long as you do not paint the thrust disc. 
 We had ours powder coated zinc primer and semi-gloss 60% gloss black from 
the thrust disc all the way over the reduction housing.  Eric&amp;Barb
