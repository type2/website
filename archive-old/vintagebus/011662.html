Hi Volks,

i have been pulling my hair out trying to find a short or shorts in Sparky,
my '60 Panel.   By the kindness of Jason, I made sure all the wires were at
the proper location on the fuse box.  I then used a multi meter to help
isolate the source.  I have located tow spots so far, the wire to the coil
and the one to the starter.  I also have not been able to get the lights
working either.  I am about to pull the whole thing out and install a new
one from RMMW.  How hard is that to do?  Any suggestions from the list?  I
am sorry if there is not enough info, my brain is fried!

Jamie
