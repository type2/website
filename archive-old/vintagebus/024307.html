Subject: Re: insulation

&gt; I'd kinda like to get an idea as to how people feel about insulating a

&gt;
&gt; bus before putting panels back in - is it worth while? - does it lead
&gt; to
&gt; more rust? - if it is useful what kinda would be best? - and when i
&gt; removed my interior to do some welding the blanket like thing that
&gt; sits
&gt; between the back seat and motor was beyond salvage - so i need to
&gt; replace it - any ideas as to what I should use?

I have been considering putting insulation in my bus as well, and have
been leaning towards the inch thick board type used for out side
insulation on new construction and surrounding foundation, it is coated
with a reflective barrier, and is fire retarding, as well as being solid

and not holding water it will not really cause any more rust problems
than would normally be had with out it. I believe it only has a r11
rating or perhaps a r15 not the best that can be had but depending on
the placement it should probably be sufficient. I was also considering
adding a second barrier of sheet mylar, can found for about $50 a roll
of 100 feet, and is the same sort of thing used for emergency blankets
with a 97% reflectivity rating to radiate heat back in and cold out. my
plan was to put the board insulation in first then add the mylar to the
back of the panels when they where put back in perhaps two layers
depending on how much I have. I was also planing on making quilted
curtains for it with the mylar layer in the middle, not only will it
make better insulation for the curtains it will make them more of a
light barrier. I had been thinking if I could get away with it I might
mylar the outside of the roof to help prevent the heat build up in the
summer, had even had and idea of mylaring the whole of the out side of
the bus, but I think that might be illegal in most areas.. something
about a moving mirror might just make a few cops a bit unhappy.
