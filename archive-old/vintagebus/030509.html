Subject: [VB] VWoA, hubcaps

&lt;&lt;This whole VWoA thing is really strange on how they are going about
it. One
of my suppliers had a container load of VW hubcaps confiscated and
destroyed, which doesn't make any sense since VW doesn't sell early
hubcaps
and nobody that I know of has a license with them to sell them. Then
another
supplier had all there license plate frames with VW 19## taken along
with
all there T-shirts with the Volkswagen name and VW Logo on them. RMMW
are
going to fight them and from what I have heard through the grape vine
have
hired a bank of attorneys to do so. Mid-America is cooperating with
VWoA,
but they know the ropes being they are one of the largest Corvette
aftermarket suppliers in the world. It is going to be interesting to see

what comes of the VW rampage.&gt;&gt;

Seems like a risky way of doing it, too. Because, if they can be shown
to be wrong in court, then it would seem that they would be guilty of a
&quot;taking&quot;, which, being a violation of their constitutional rights also
carries with it the threat of TRIPLE damages plus punative damages. If
RMMW prevails, it would seem they would be entitled to a very large
payday. How do we pack the jury box :) ??

But in reality. . . look for all manufacturers to follow suit. If it is
profitable for Harley Davidson, corporate boards are compelled to seek
maximum profits for their shareholders, or face shareholder suits of
their own for not working in their best interest. Like it or not, this
is the world we all live in now. When you play Monopoly, you can't
change the rules.
