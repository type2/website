Subject: Re: [VB] Engine mount

I like the bolt and nut system better than the threaded inset.    with the 
engine out you can tap the piece out (tap towards crank pulley  side.   i run a 
doghouse.   other people prefer the threaded  insert system, just MO.
 
some trannys have the place for the half moon bolt to catch, some  don't.   
look at yours next time you pull the  motor.
