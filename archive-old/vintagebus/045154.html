 I'm new to the list.  I have a '65 bus w/ 12 volt converted system and 6
 volt wiper motor.  I also have a wiper assembly frame from a factory 12
 volt '66 (no motor..sob...).  Someone told me I could put a '71 motor in
 that frame (as I'm having difficulty locating the '67 12 volt motor that
 I believe would fit).  Any experience on this?  Any suggestions on
 fixing my problem here?
  &gt;&gt;
the 65 wiper assmebly is one year only.  To fit a later one in your bus you 
have to mash the heater vents.  I was not willing to do this in my 65 daily 
driver, and not only because I find defog an important function.  But It was 
a 12V system with a 6V wiper motor when I got it.  And the wipers went a wee 
bit fast.  So I hooked a voltage drop in line from the power wire to the 
switch.
