&gt; Want to get an oil pump with filter and have a universal H case, question

Be aware that it (the pump/filter) will not fit with a stock bus
exhaust.  Not sure you are going to use one, but if you intend to, you
will have to either cut and angle/reweld the housing (per E&amp;B...never
could figure out where to have that done.  I don't have a TIG) or cut
off and block, (or like me re-route) the left side pre heat tube to
allow clearance for the filter. Its a bit of a tubing cut and paste job.

You'll also have to use a much smaller filter.  I use a BMW 2002. 
Lastly, you'll want to wrap the filter in some type of flexible heat
wrap, as the filter resides EXTREMELY close to the muffler.  I'm still
debating weather this closeness is contributing to my hot oil problem
when there is high ambient outside heat

But hey at least its getting filtered oil.
