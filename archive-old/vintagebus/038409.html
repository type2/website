Ok, 24 hours later...

Replies all suggesting that I'm trying to cram a 200mm flywheel into a
tranny that hasn't been ground out yet...  so I'm going to follow Eric &amp;
Barb's procedure to grind out the tranny with the flywheel.  I've asked
previously, and no one steered me away from this, so I hope I'm not
violating a purist rule.  Rex, I wrote you 12 hours ago without a reply, so
I presume you are OK with this here procedure on a bus you intend to
purchase?  This Crew is definitely in the &quot;daily beater&quot; category, so I know
I can answer my own question...

Now I'm still confused by the clutch.  It seems to me that this tranny has a
sleeve over the driveshaft, much like a 1971 and later clutch (and not 1970
and prior)?

Here are three photos, depicting the tooth marks I already put into the
bellhousing and the TOB type:

I haven't touched any swing axle tranny before, nor any 6v stuff, but I've
done several engine swaps and pulls on '72 bug, 1971 bus, and 1970 bus
(there is a clutch design and TOB change in 1971, so I'm familiar with that
change, so that is my point of reference on the &quot;sleeve&quot; over the
driveshaft).

P.S.  So, looking ahead -- given that this tranny has never been &quot;touched&quot;
by a 200mm flywheel, I should just assume the starter is not right for a
200mm flywheel, right?  So I should avoid using the starter until it is
swapped?  Is it OK to push start?
