...Adjust the drag link to center the steering wheel.  Doing the tie rods 
adjusts the alignment, which is different.    Leave the pitman arm alone, or 
you will be able to turn the wheel more one way than the other.

&gt;  &gt;Speaking of turns to lock, I recently popped off the pittman arm(correct
&gt;  &gt;name???) so I could straighten the wheel (wasnít too successful as there
&gt;  &gt;is too much play in the center pivot).  Upon centering up the wheel I
&gt;  &gt;reinstalled the arm.  To my dismay, I must have turned the wheel too many
&gt;  &gt;times as my turn to the left is WAY to short!  I think the QEII could make
&gt;  &gt;a left hand U turn in less space.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in its
&gt;  &gt;throw??  How many turns from lock does the output shaft have to go to get
&gt;  &gt;centered??
