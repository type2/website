Subject: VW Palm Pilot files

Don't know how many of the list members do the Palm Pilot thing, but 
I had created some files that have all the years, vins, and engine 
numbers for VW's. I downloaded them to my palm and have them handy 
for when I come across a VW and want to help find the year or ID the 
engine. Nice and handy.  I put them up on my webpage for anyone who 
wants. Just click the link on the left for &quot;VW Palm Pilot Files&quot;. 
Hope someone else gets use out of them.

I plan to keep trying to find other ways to put some &quot;VW BUS&quot; use to 
my Palm. I already use it to keep track of my gas and milage and 
service stuff. Always looking for something new.

See Ya.
