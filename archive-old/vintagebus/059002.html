Subject: CrewCab ForSale Sacramento Area

Right off the bat, it's not mine, and it's a '71,
but it's so cool, that I had to pass the info on
to the VB list. Someone please forward this on 
the loaf list.

Saw this bus, and it is really sweet. Original dove
blue paint, roof rack. Everything looks like a 5
year old bus. The sign indicates that he's done
a bunch of mechanical stuff to it, engine, suspension,
etc, but I didn't write any of it down.

Considering how rare loaf crewcabs are in the US,
he's still asking a bunch for this bus. I just wish
I hit the lottery, I'd jump on it.

They also have a non-westy VB pop-top camper in the
driveway, but it's not for sale, but it at least
indicates a love of old VW busses.

'71 CrewCab $8500 firm 530-478-1628

I could be persuaded (easily) to go check it out
more closely, if someone is serious about this.
