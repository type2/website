Subject: Power steering in an early bus ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

an old friend called the other day asking if I knew of a way to put power 
steering on his buses, 

he has a 66 Kombi and a 73 Westy

He hurt his shoulder badly and even at the best it will never be strong 
again, 
he needs to be able to parallel park where he lives and works, and the hard 
steering of the bus is too much for him.......

SO.....any ideas ?

the pump on the motor is not the problem , and I know some old Ford Mustangs 
had Power assist which was an extra hydraulic ram to push - pull the steering 
arms

He really wants to drive his buses , I hate to see him have to sell them 
.......

thanks for your collective help.......
