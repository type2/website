Subject: still chasing flickers

Status update:

        I have recharged the battery with a strong reading of 12.79
volts.  I never did see if anybody knew if the voltage of the battery
changed the voltage coming out of the regulator.  We decided to go to a
local Mexican restaurant (aka road test) tonight.  The generator light
now decides to come on when I am at a stand still.  It no longer
flickers when I am driving on the road.  The drive was about ten miles
round trip so it was not that big of a drive.  I returned home full of
nachos and salsa  hoping to see that the voltage on the battery stayed
somewhat close to 12.79 volts. It was 12.61 volts, which I guess that
this is a step in the right direction from a dead battery.  The
generator light was still pretty bright as I parked my bus for the
night.  My next option will be to make sure the communicator is CLEAN
with nothing but pure shine.  My inner self keeps telling me that the
spring that holds the brushes is loosing its strength.

p.s. I never saw the results about the thread concerning a place to
purchase a tool that will repair the rivets in the vent windows.

p.s.s. I am the son of an engineer whose numbers must always be precise
and exact and the son of a flower child mother who taught me peace and
volkswagens.
