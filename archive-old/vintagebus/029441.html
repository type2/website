Subject: carb spacer

This 40hp has been getting under my skin for the past week or so...its
always something with it.  Well, I got it down to where I just need a
carb spacer.  No problem I think...I'll just throw on a governor.  I did
this...fired it up...ran beautifully.  Then, I go to fit the air
cleaner.  No go...not enough clearance for it to fit on the carb.  So I
take off the carb...and take some measurements on how high up the carb
needs to be for it to clear the generator, but yet fit the air cleaner.
So I took these to a friend of mine who works in a machine shop.  ( i
recently installed a new engine in his 69 bus)  We mic'd everything out,
got us a block of aluminum, put it on the mill and went to work.  2 or
so hours later I end up with a PERFECT fit carb spacer to my specs.  The
holes are the exact size, and are spaced appropriately.  The ends are
surfaced to an almost mirrored finish.  Its the shape of the top plate
of an intake manifold ...so it just looks like a shiny extension of the
intake manifold plate....going straight up.  I'm going out to bolt it on
in a few minutes.  I wish I had a digital camera....  Me fixing that bus
for them really went well overall.  It helped them out a ton, stuck some
dough in my pocket, created a good friendship, and was an all around
great learning experience.  Plus...I got to work with a brand new engine
(thanks Ronnie!) that was clean, and enjoyable to work on.  I finally
got it purring along nicely last night before we headed over to the
machine shop.  I filed the top plate of the intake manifold where the
carb sits to a really nice, smooth finish.  This helped it seal up a lot
better...and no more leaks.  It idles as well now.

Good day everyone,
Isaiah
