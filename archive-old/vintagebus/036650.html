Hi Richard,

I believe that the faintly glowing generator/alternator light may have
something to do with the buildup of resistance in the connectors of the
light's circuit. An old VW mechanic told me to dry up and stop whining about
mine five years ago and I have never had any problem with starting etc. Best
to check charge rate though to be certain.

Later 

Michael
