Subject: Freight shipping help?

I've finally found the correct interior for my 64' sundial camper.  Problem
is...  I'm on the east coast, its on the west coast.  As these things go, I
can arrange for local delivery to a friend in san diego, but still need to
get it shipped out here.  Has anyone had experience with this.  I have no
clue where to start.  Are there companies who will show up and pick it up?
Will they pack it for a fee?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.


Emmet
