Hi there,

If you still have the original front sliders on the Westfalai, but no
curtains anymore.... which is a common occurrence, you should be able to
find a curtain cloth binding with loops in it for the sliders at your local
fabric shop. This binding is sewn directly to the curtains and away you go!
The binding material is white in color but because of the loops close
proximity to the sliders, you can't see this either inside or out. This
material is relatively cheap as well.

Put new curtains in a couple of years ago and no problems...
