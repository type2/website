Subject: 63 commercial brochure truck pages on literature site

I have out 6 pages from the brochure that I got at Kelley park.
The scans are really large so that you can read the text.
This is I think a later version of the brochure that is in the Japanese site 
that I reference.

I anyone wants the whole brochure scanned at high resolution I will have to 
put it on a CD as this page is 1.5 megs in size and the whole brochure would 
kill my allocated site space,
