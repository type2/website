Subject: Re: [VB] Bumpers Again

 1965 (late) Busses had a slash front and a pionted
rear bumper. The story is that VW ran out of the rears
and had to use the pointed rears that were slated for
the 66 model year bus.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; For reference, my 65 has a pointed-end front bumper
&gt; with deluxe trim. It 
&gt; does not have over-riders which I always thought
&gt; that was weird until I 
&gt; saw a European (French) brochure for the 65 Deluxe
&gt; and no over-riders 
&gt; were present.
&gt; 
&gt; Mine did not come with a back bumper when my family
&gt; bought it in 79 - 
&gt; so, I'd have to assume that the back was slash.

&gt; &gt; Hi Steffan,
&gt; &gt; If you want it correct, then yes.  1965 was the
&gt; year the bus had one of 
&gt; &gt; each
&gt; &gt; style.  Probably the stampings for the other had
&gt; not been completed!
