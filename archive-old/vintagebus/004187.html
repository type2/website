that thar sentence - expertly executed says the whole damn sheebang.

i've been around the lists for a long while - sometimes voiciferous
sometimes a 'nobody user'

thing is when i subscribed i knew my messages were going to an online
searchable list archive. i gave permission for these posts to go to 'that'
achive by default. in the long shot - i wont have any recourse other than
intellectual (huh!) property rights to quible over what happens to these
posts in 'this' archive.

publishing in print, cdrom, or any other format  is another matter- 'if'
anything ever happens to warrant it i could, i should, and i would fight.
and i'd win.
that could be if i concidered someone to be making too much hard cash, or
someone losing out, or even that i wanted something removed because i
changed my mind about something i said 6 years ago.

you mustnt forget that as much as theres a law for the US listees theres
probably 30 other laws involved.

its a hell of a messy thing to widen the goal posts when the match has
started.

stephen - your efforts are well appreciated.
i've gotta say - regardless of personal preferences ken is right - its an
extra risk not worth taking.

i'd 'like' a cd of the whole archive - but its not right to publish one. its
right if it says so from now - and everything new goes into the bag for a
later date - but old stuff had its destiny mapped out.

its good as it was - i hope we can have it back as it was - but lets not all
lose friends over this.
snydy remarks suck.

i've enjoyed the posts about this - and no i dont think it harms the list at
all - its rather dismissive for someone to say 'enough already, lets get
back to the vws' it is something that could affect us all forever.

having said that - let this be the last word on the subject ;)  --&gt;peace.
Glynn
