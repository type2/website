I picked up the hubcap last night from Joel and company over in St
Petersburg; a great group out there that get together every Saturday night
at an antique car rally on US 19 just off of Gandy Blvd.  If you are ever in
the Tampa Bay area (vacation/business/whatever) on a Saturday night I would
recommend stopping by.  I am looking
forward to going back out there again.

We do however have a problem with 'the package' before I can let it go any
further; your help is needed.  I believe the hubcap may have picked up some
'evil spirits' out in the Everglades yesterday.  As Joel was getting ready
to head home last night one of his tires went flat on him, and as I went
accross the Gandy bridge my red light kicked in (looks like my generator
took a dirt nap; it gave me a scare at 11PM, but I was able to get it home
with dimming lights only the last 10 miles or so).
I will be getting out the Muir book (and looking at the 'Rituals' chapter)
today to see if I can exorcise the demons from the hubcap before I send it
on it's way.   I saw aprocedure posted a couple of weeks ago about using
candles and drawing a VW emblem with salt on the garage floor to remove a
persistant gland nut.  Will this procedure also remove demons from a
hubcap??  The _LAST_ thing I want to do is pass the 'bad moe-joe' along.

It looks like Jed (who also lives in Lakeland) and I will be hooking up in
the next few days for the exchange before it heads to Gainesville,
Jacksonville and out of the state.

BTW the case is _full_ of really  neat stuff (I especially liked the
emergency box that Marv included, and the _way cool_ patch added by the NC
Bus club (I want one of those; where/how do I get one!!).  Im looking for a
Disney sticker (no trip to Florida would be complete without something from
the 'mouse house') to add to the case as well.
