I do see your point in regard to the usage/damage ratio between bicycles and autos but considering that roads are made for automobiles and not bicycles, and it is through the fees attached to autos that roads are maintained, it seems only fair that they should contribute to the upkeep of roads too. I think it would be safe to assume that the extra 3 feet of asphalt on either side of a road to provide a bike lane for cyclists cost extra money to someone. Usage is still causing wear, albeit less than an auto, but wear is wear. 
 Mopeds and motorcycles do less damage that autos do to roads but they too pay fees to use them. 
 I don't think it's unreasonable to think that those who use something should be willing to contribute to it's upkeep.
