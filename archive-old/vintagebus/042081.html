&gt; I'm not clear on your comment involving an external drain tube from a
&gt; plastic battery box...

Somebody suggested it, but I decided not to add one.  No need, as that
much liquid doesn't accumulate there.

&gt; The plastic battery boxes are essentially an oddly-proportioned dish pan,
&gt; and the only way they can leak fluid is if they are holed/cracked, or filled
&gt; to overflowing.  I've used them, both Grp. 24 and Grp. 27 sizes,  for over
&gt; 25 years in boats, trucks, and VW buses and have never had any kind of
&gt; failure despite some truly severe conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; A plastic battery box may not be &quot;correct&quot; in a VW bus, but it virtually
&gt; guarantees that there won't be any acid damage to surfaces or components
&gt; adjacent to the battery.

Very true.  I've been putting off adding one, but if I do it now I can
just replace the center part of the battery tray.  If I wait, the edges
will rust out and it'll be major repair time.

I just replaced the battery and had a heck of a time with the fine folks
at Pep Boys.  Normally they do the pro-rate thing with no-fuss,
particularly since I actually keep the receipts.  This time they gave me a
hard time since I habitually use a group 24 battery in the bus, not the
bug-size battery specified by their computer.  After a couple of tries the
counter guy said &quot;I just can't figure out how to make it accept this.&quot;
&quot;How about if I enter it as an '84 toyota?&quot;  I didn't think much of this
idea, since next time they might demand to see the vehicle (never have
before, but who knows?)  Finally they got the computer-savvy guy there and
he did a &quot;manual adjustment&quot; and did the deed for me.

This may just be a fluke, but it makes me a bit leery of pep boys.  Still,
it's better than some parts houses that insist upon doing a &quot;charging
system check&quot; that does god-knows-what to the systems on my bus that I
already know are just fine.
