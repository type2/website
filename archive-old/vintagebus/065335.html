Subject: AIRS &quot;Rescue&quot;

A guy named Jeff got my email off the AIRS list.  He was buying a bus
up here in Sacramento and going to drive it back to LA.  He calls first
thing this morning with a fuel line issue - he filled it up, and fuel
was going everywhere in the engine compartment.  Turns out one of the
overflow lines had disintegrated.   He brought it by my house, I changed
the line, checked the oil, topped off the trans fluid and tires, and
sent him on his way.   5 minutes later he was knocking on my door again
&quot;This stalled and this light came on....&quot;  Relax - let it warm up...

Here he is, the proud new owner with his first VW.

See? I don't discriminate against bays!  A lowered one even!  Not too much, 
anyway.  If Henry Ford had bought VW back in 48 things would be different.
