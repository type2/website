Subject: Re: [VB] sundial interior

Chuck,
   I've not seen an original with anything but the vinyl.  What year is 
yours?  Is yours a Kombi or panel, does it have the logo?  Have any pics?  
Post them on http://www.sundial-camper_dot_com

you said it matches the front seats.  It is probably an after market job, 
Sundial usually left them salt and pepper.  Someone correct me please if I 
am wrong.

&gt;Date: Mon, 12 Nov 2001 18:30:24 -0800
&gt;
&gt;every pic I've seen of sundial interiors have had a leatherette or vynal
&gt;camp cushions. our new to us 66 sundial has a heavy almost saddle blanket
&gt;type covering which I would normally assume to have been added later except
&gt;that its done too professionally and also covers a little bit of the wall 
&gt;in
&gt;the rear and also the front seats. has anyone run across this before? 
&gt;should
&gt;all sundials be vynal?
&gt;thanks all
&gt;Chuck
&gt;Van Is
