&gt;&gt; can someone give me the &quot;ruff&quot; equivalent to a 4.8 X 13MM screw in inches.
&gt;
&gt;13mm  length is 1/2&quot;.
&gt;But the 4.8 is not a real size for a screw. Are you sure it isn't 4x??  I
&gt;don't know of a 4 x .8.    There is 4 x .70 and 4 x .75.
&gt;A 4 x .75 is very very close to 8-32 SAE.

If the 4.8 is marked on the head of the screw it's probably a grade
marking - a code for the strength of the part.  SAE equivalent is
about class 2.  Karl noted the length equivalent of 13mm; this would
also apply if the head is 13mm (across flats).  If you're looking for
the thread size of a bolt that is 13 mm across flats, it would be M8
metric or about 5/16 or 3/8 SAE. 

Not to labor the obvious but if you want it to fit, replace both
parts at the same time - it'll be hard to get an SAE bolt to fit
a metric nut and vice versa.  Usually it will either fall apart or
booger up the threads or both...

In researching this reply I stumbled across a great set of reference
charts at http://www.americanfastener_dot_com/techcharts.htm .  Click on
the &quot;metric&quot; table entry for the info of greatest interest to us.
Not a customer or an employee; just found some good info.  My OG
front shock upper mount bolts on my '64 are marked &quot;12K&quot;; their
metric chart shows that this is Futhark for &quot;12.9&quot;.
