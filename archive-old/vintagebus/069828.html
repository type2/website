&gt;
&gt;Introducing the larger 1500cc engine in 66 (over 11% larger than the
&gt;previous 1300) in my opinion is what sparked the design of the bay
&gt;window bus.

I think it was probably more competition from other makes.  When Buses
first came out, Ford didn't have the Econoline/Transit van.  Chevy had
the Suburban but you could argue that it was more of a big station wagon
than a van.  For a long time, VW was the only game in town for an
inexpensive panel van.  By the early to mid-60s the other makes had
caught up and were offering vans with similar room but V6s and V8s.
Also, safety was becoming more of a buzzword.  VW probably felt that the
new body style would help them remain competitive and allow them to
design more safety features into the product.  It was also a chance to
include more general changes or improvements: when the Split was designed,
reliable CV joints weren't available, radial tires didn't exist and 60
MPH was considered really fast.

1500s were available as an M-code a few years before they became
standard.  If there was a big cooling problem, I think you would have
seen modifications to the Bus body for '66.  Also, I don't think VW made
the 1500 standard in August '65 and _then_ decided to design a totally
new body for August '67.  The Bays were probably already on the drawing
board and perhaps even prototyped.

Data points:  Per the '63-'67 Bentley, the 1200 needed 500 L / sec
(18 cu ft / sec) of cooling air at 3600 rpm, with the heater shut off.
The 1500 from Jan '63 needed 550 L / sec, 19.6 cu ft / sec _at_ 3800 rpm,
10% more than the 1200.  The 1500 from Aug '65 needed 575 L / sec,
21 cu ft / sec _at_ 4100 rpm, 15% more than the 1200.
