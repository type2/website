Was writ:


I spent all day yesterday fixing the lights on the bus so I could get it
safety inspected today. I started with a single left hand tail light and
when I was finished I had a complete set of running, brake and turn
lights :-)  So today I'm off to the inspector and as I put the clutch in
and am rolling to a stop in front of the shop I hear a big clunk and I
feel a real loose clutch pedal. I try to put it back in gear and check
out what happened but alas, it won't go in gear. I get underneath
thinking, &quot;Good thing the cable broke now insted of on our trip in 10
days&quot; However, once under the bus I'm able to see that the cable is
still quite solid and attached. Leaving the only thing left, jacked-up
cluth stuff. What exactly I'm not sure yet. Did the throwout bearing get
dislodged, did the springs in the spring plate break or something? Who
knows.

could be the throw out (up) arm broken.

pull the motor and find was was happening with the clutch system.

maintenance tips...

change the gear oil while the engine is out.    If the boots are torn or
cracked replace them.   Fill w/gear oil afte rthe boots are replaced.
Easier to fill w/ motor out

replace fuel line

replace engine to body seal

replace oil cooler seals and main seal, reset crankshaft endplay if there is
any excess

install thermostat set up.

replace any grommets that look sad or are missing.

bleed/flush brakes (easier to do the rear w/o a motor in the way.)   hey,
have you replaced the brake hoses?    old cracked  or non cracked hosea cold
be collapsed inside, if they have bulges on them they  are immenenty going to
explode, leaving the brake usefullness reduced.  replace if it hasn't been
done in the last 5 years.   easier w/motor out as fluid doesn't drip in your
eyes.   get an 11mm line wrench.

wipe grease off wires.   clean wires are good.  oil ages them and makes them
crack and go bad.

if your  bus has a non functioning gas sender, take this time to pull the gas
tank, and replace the sender.
........
 Does anyone else have jack points on there bus
that don't even get dirty before your putting a jack to them again? Just
curious, maybe it's just me.

everything under my bus is dirty.   puh-leeze, I drive it.   aint no mirrors
going under a bus of mine at a show.    but I dont use the jack point except
in case of emergency, I use a floor jack, much safer.   on the front beam or
on the U under the trans w/ a 4x4, usually
