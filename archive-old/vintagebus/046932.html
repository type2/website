Subject: Got My Tranny, Thanks Ronnie!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, Ronnie and I found out exactly what happened to my tranny.  Seem I 
grenaded the fulcrums and totally destroyed the paddles on the axles! DOH! 
Anyone else had this happen?

So I have all those coming on Friday morning from rancho.  I did pick up 
EVERYTHING else I needed like the tranny center section bearings and tons of 
other stuff from Ronnie in Havasu.  Great guy!  For those of you who have not 
done business with him, he is great.  From all the reviews I read and have 
heard about RANCHO I believe I am going to be way happy!  On the road in 2 
more days!!!  Again thanks to RONNIE and the crew from RANCHO! 

Now back to working on the bus at 1:30 am :) 
IM addicted!
