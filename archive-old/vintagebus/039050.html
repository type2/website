Subject: [VB] Axle boot replacement???

HELP!!!  I'm replacing the axle boots on my 58 single cab and have a couple
quick questions:

1.  I have a 1965 big-nut tranny.  Bentley says there are 2 different boots
- 111 598 021A and 111 598 021B and that the &quot;B&quot; version is correct for the
tranny I have (slightly bigger inside diameter on the tranny end).  Neither
my local VW FLAPS nor RMMW nor Bus Depot shows the &quot;B&quot; version.  So do I
stretch the &quot;A&quot; version to fit or do I need to find a &quot;B&quot; version??

2.  Bentley says to use a joining compound to seal the seam of my new boot.
What the heck should I use for this??

Thanks!!!!!
