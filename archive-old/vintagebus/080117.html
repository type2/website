Subject: Re: classic insurance

Hi,

Thanks for the reminder. I need to do this.

I just did a quick search, and several resources cautioned against the  
&quot;stated amount/value&quot; option because (1) this is the maximum that will  
be paid not exactly the amount that will be paid, (2) this option  
usually has a clause that stipulates, &quot;or actual cash value&quot; which is  
what the adjuster will use to settle your loss for an amount less than  
the stated amount.

They suggest using the &quot;agreed amount/value&quot; option. This isn't an  
option in some states, such as mine.

A good article:

BTW, I wonder how the car carrier is fairing after dropping a load of  
365s on the highway:
