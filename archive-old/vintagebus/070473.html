Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Yokohama quote

&gt; &gt;I always use the best old tire as a spare.
&gt;
&gt; That's always been my practice - but when changing tire sizes?  I guess it would be better than nothing, and no worse than those space-saver spares
&gt; that people run around on at 60 mph for weeks....
&gt;
&gt; OK, y'all have convinced me.  I'll buy four.

WOO HOO! Cheapies win....
