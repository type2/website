Subject: summer is here!!

 Driving my 63 singlercab I now know that summer has come to the SF Bay area.
When I come to a stop after driving on the freeway my oil pressure light comes on.
I guess that I already know that the 40 horse will need replacing sometime soon, buit it makes no nasty noises and runs like clockwork.
So I know we are not driving in 50 degree weather.
