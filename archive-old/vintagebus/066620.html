Subject: Jim Thompson

Just heard from Jim Thompson--all is well --But at this time he is getting a
little bored--There are other issues--In 1985 Jim, while on a Motorcycle
trip was T-Boned--It appears there were some internal injuries, and now his
kidneys are operating at just 20%. Also the fact that Jim still lives alone
at Karmann Ghia Restoration,  so after his release there will be no-one to
care for him. The doctors know this,  so he may be staying longer in the
Hospital. He is out of Intensive care and has a room-mate. Please continue
to have Jim in your thoughts and prayers--and Please pass this on the any VW
chat line or list--If it is a bus list--Please forward all this info--From
Air-cooled to Water-cooled Buses--Jim is a friend of all--Bless you and
thanks, uj
