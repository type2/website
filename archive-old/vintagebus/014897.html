&gt; So this has been bugging me since the first time I ever pulled an
&gt; engine:  Why does the fuel line run through the engine tin, instead
&gt; of
&gt; through a hole in the body next to it?
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably there's some factory-recommended procedure for
&gt; disconnecting it that doesn't require you to pour gas all over
&gt; yourself and the surrounding neighborhood, but I've never figured it
&gt; out for a stock line (mostly metal, except for some very short
&gt; sections of rubber connecting the metal bits together).

My opinion is that the placement of the fuel line is a result of the
desire to make the engine a removable &quot;unit&quot;.  Once you disconnect a
few things (cables, fuel line, electrical) the entire engine comes out
as a unit.

I don't think that VW was all that uptight about the spillage of fuel. 
They expected their mechanics to be experienced professionals who could
disconnect the fuel line without showering themselves.  The same may
not be true of us amateurs.  I've been lucky enough to never lose more
than a few drops of fuel, and the smoking lamp is definitely out for
that procedure!
