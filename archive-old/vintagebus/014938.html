Hi all, 

I'll chime in on recent comments concerning the MoFoCo show in mid-summer.

The MoFoCo show in Union Grove, Wisconsin SUCKS, it SUCKS hugely, it SUCKS
grandiously, it SUCKS sooo big time that it was probably the most
disappointing VW event that I've ever paid to attend, hell, that I've ever
attended period!  Don't waste your time, and a LOT of your hard earned
money!  Can you spell &quot;Rip-off&quot;?

But the DBG Bus campout nearby that same weekend was worth the seven hour
one way trip!!!  Woo Hoo!
