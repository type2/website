There was someone not too long ago that had mentioned a place that was either
using .009 points plates or was using a repop for the 010 and 019. Maybe
Ronnie knows.

I have always liked running 010's on my buses.  Nice little advance
curve....just screams through 1st and 2nd gears.  I ran one on my 1600DP and a
34pict3 setup.  Then again I like to drive balls to the wall in my bus so it
stays floored.

The points and whatnot are getting a little tougher to find, so if you get
one, keep that in mind when shopping for tune up parts.  BFY always had them
along with a few others.  I've got a box full of new points, condensors and
rotors, along with about 10 or so old 010's I've gathered through the years.

I switched to a vac. dizzy (205 - I think) and did get a little better gas
mileage but the response wasn't as 'crisp' in my opinion.  I consistently got
20-23 mpg with the 010.
