Subject: RE: [VB] engine bolts

i think i will leave the drivers side as is, but try the block of wood on
the clutch pedal while inserting the bolt. as for the passenger side-i
usually do the reverse of this...i put a vise grip on the head of the bolt
above the starter-before i insert the engine. it stays relatively
secure...then when i insert the engine it is easier for me to tighten the
nut from the engien compartment. the vise grip keeps the bolt from turning.
when finished i reach up and tap the vise grips with extended fingers till
the thing pops free. i read once about welding a little bar to the end of
the bolt to keep it from turning...but i get nervous about that ever
breaking partially off and not being able to ever get a wrench on the thing.

I have this great tool that has a magnetic 17mm socket bit, and two ears.
you set it on the end of the bolt at the tranny end, then can put the nut on
the engine side esily.  Before that I did the vise grip thing.  For the
starter side I'd get the bolt through, then start the nut on the bolt.  put
vise grips on the nut, and then use a couple extensions to reachy past the
starter and tighten it down with a ratchet from under neath.
