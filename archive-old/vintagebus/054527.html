Subject: Re: [VB] BUMPERS FOR MY 56

err, uh, yeah but....if you have to pay to have the metal ones straightened
you could just buy another new fiberglass one for the same or less money.
If you can find originals at a good price that don't need straightening then
yeah, go that way.  If not, Ronnies are a good option.

&gt; ..until you bump into something. =)
&gt;
&gt; seriously, there are plenty of decent metal ones available at fair prices
&gt; (for 45 year old parts). i've even seen nos ones recently at not bad
&gt; prices. the only bummer part about 56 bumpers is that it may take the
early
&gt; &quot;barndoor&quot; spaced ribs for the front bumper.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;..... has them in fiberglass at a fraction of the
&gt; &gt; price of the originals..  Once they are painted you cannot tell the
&gt; &gt; difference.
