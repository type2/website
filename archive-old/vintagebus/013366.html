I bought one of the LDC shields and it is amazing.  I just learned to weld but with that helmet and a mig a monkey could weld.  It is awsome for doing detailed work as well.  I have weled up small cracks in engine tin and would never be able to do that when trying to flip a shield down and then weld.  Good luck.
