&gt;To get my bus streetable i need to get my emergency lights working  ( CA 
&gt;brake and light inspection ).  i foung that the wire going to the turn signal 
&gt;switch was cut, but when i reconnect the wire only the switch bulb on the 
&gt;dash lights up. the switch is also connected to the S-  on the flasher relay 
&gt;box, and i can hear the box switching on and off. 

I'm guessing the cut wire was the blue one from the turn signal switch
to the hazard flasher switch.  It should be connected to terminal K
on the hazard flasher switch.  That brown wire to S- on the flasher
relay (9 prong box) should be connected to terminal S on the the
hazard flasher switch.  Also, the hazard flasher switch should be
grounded...I believe it grounds through its mounting nut - there's
not a separate wire.

If your turn signal and brake lights are all working, and everything is
hooked up right, the emergency lights *should* work.  You might want
to go through the &quot;troubleshooting&quot; section in my 9-prong box write up
at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html .  This will
help isolate any trouble to the bulbs, wiring, turn signal switch,
hazard flasher switch, or 9-prong box.  Also, get the wiring diagram
for your Bus at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html if you
don't already have it.

Good luck!
