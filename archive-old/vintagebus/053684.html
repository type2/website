Subject: Re: [VB] List harvesting

Hi List,

     This is Matt in PA, I got a virus &quot;from&quot; Irie Volks, but obviouslly, he 
didnt send it,  the virus got into my Addres book, (assumably) and had made 
it look like it was from him.  I had the same mail come from the addresses 
of several other friends.  I read this e-mail, and the previously mentioned 
came to mind, simply because I wondered if the &quot;virus&quot; or whatever got the 
vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com address and sent an e-mail from me to all of you, which 
would really suck!  This was a while ago, and I am still on the list, so I 
suppose nothing happened.

On a more VW related note, When I first got on this list a while ago, did I 
hear there was one for beetles too?  just wondering...

see ya,
Matt

im still here.  i had this happen to me from somebody else on the list.  im
not intentionally spamming anybody.  so dont be so quick to jump the gun.
if this has happened to anybody else from me, let me know and ill change
from outlook express to a hotmail account to prevent it from happening
again.  my apologies to anyone else this has happened to.
