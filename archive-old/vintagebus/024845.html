Hi;
        My name is Michael Hathaway. I have been on the list for awhile
but this is my first time to post since leaving the list last year. My
question is how hard is it to replace a steering gear box on a 1963
single cab and were is a good place to get a steering gear box? Any
input would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in Advance;

Michael Hathaway

(1963 Single Cab)
