Subject: Re: [VB] KP - walking in

I don't know if you need to worry about 'up to par' - I've
seen some pretty beat-down cars _at_ KP!

But yes, you can park in one of the city lots are hike in,
laughing at everyone idling in line.

&gt; *Fortunately* my busses/car are not up to par with Kelly Park and I will be 
&gt; walking in to the place, I think...   Never been to KP, can I park outside 
&gt; somewheres and walk in with my little red wagon?  Or do you have to wait in 
&gt; those everlasting lines you all are venting about to get to the parking 
&gt; area?  Thanks for any suggestions.
