The running lights are also known as the parking lights (suppose it
depends on whether you're moving or not when you have them on).
They're on whenever the headlight switch is not turned completely off;
also known as the non-blinking part of the rear lights.

right- and the guy said his taillights worked and his running lights didn't 
which confuses me.  Though of course running lights can mean front and rear 
while taillights is the rear only.
