Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Earlybirds

Sorry that the gates won't be open until noon on Friday.  We were able to 
officially make it a 3-day event, but with that restriction.  

As for places to stay:  There is a campground near the top of Mingus 
Mountain, not far out of Jerome.  Take the 89-A out of Jerome, UP the hill, NOT down 
toward Cottonwood/Clarkdale.  The campground is clearly signed (last I was up 
there).  An alternative are the several bed/breadfasts or hotels in Jerome.

Let me know if there is anything we can do to help out,
