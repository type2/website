Subject: Re: [VB] How good can the steering get?

4 inches is not excessive (that was side to side)!  That's actually only 2
inches till a wheel moves (and probably closer to 1 3/4&quot;).  If Bentley said
1&quot; then that means I'm only 1&quot; out of spec.  For a 43yr old steering box, I
think that's great, and also considering the steering wheel is about as big
as a hula hoop. Hell, my company vehicle has almost that much, and it only
has 20k miles on it.

&gt; &gt; My steering box has about 4 inches of play in it (in other words, my box
&gt; &gt; will go 2 inches one way before moving, and 2 inches the other, which is
&gt; &gt; way less than my '67 westy, and I'm measuring this at the two arms on
the
&gt; &gt; steering wheel), and I
&gt; &gt; don't think that is excessive.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Charles,
&gt; 4 inches of play is excessive!  You should be able to adjust your steering
&gt; box down to 1 inch or get it rebuilt/replaced.   Eric&amp;Barb
