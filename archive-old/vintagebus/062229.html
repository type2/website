Subject: show/trip report 

Been futzing with the buses etc. in prep for vintage meet for about a month 
now-the 65 westy got the new 195/75/14 LT tires mounted on the powder coated 
rims, hubcap clips installed, and the rims on the bus with hubcaps even!  
Eviscerated the camper, made roof wood panels, which got installed last wed, 
and the camper kits stuck back in.  That bus is actually looking decent now.  
And to think I almost tipped it over on a slope in the sand hills in the sage 
brush and rocks in e WA a few years ago, and thought, &quot;oh well, if it tips it 
tips&quot;  Didn't get the bds lights dimming lack of voltage issue dialed in, but 
the brakes were better after new rear wheel cylinders.  brakes are the same 
size as a 68 bug, FWIW! Got everything packed up for the swap and we left 
Friday afternoon to go up to Seattle, stopped at the gas station to gas up 
the 53 and check the tires for air, and realised the stapler for attaching 
signs for vintage meet was in the garage.

So back home, and I smelled a bad smell from the bd.  the right rear drums 
was hot, and burning off the bit of brake fluid I hadn't cleaned off the 
outside of the drum!!!  ended up backing the shoe of a turn and it was fine- 
shoes must have shifted.  

Took about 2 hours to get to the burgermaster, driving 45-50mph on I-5- with 
the shiny 65 as tailbus to the stealth surface rusty brown BD.  Not sure the 
speedo is right, think it goes faster than it says, though I am not so good 
at converting km to miles, I drove about 65-70kph by my speedo.  plus it has 
the bug rims/ 6.00 tires on it instead of the 16&quot; bus rims.  Susan 
used-to-be-Crandall passed us going much faster in her 66 stylee dormobile

    The show was great as usual.  Nice and sunny.  Didn't see much of the 
show cars, but ogled the tipper truck and various campers.

Headed south on Monday about 1pm, my Dad and me in the 65.  I changed the oil 
&amp; filter and adjusted the valves that morning.  Missed Portland rush hour 
traffic.  Got pretty hot in the Willamette Valley- 95 F and oil temp stayed 
about 100C.  kept it to just under 60mph, where 3K is.   A bit dodgey taking 
this engine on a long trip, as had only done about 600 miles on it since 
getting it as a mystery 1600DP. but after the first couple changes the oil 
had stayed pretty clean, and the valves hadn't got more than slightly out of 
adjustment and it sounded good.  Have a 6V small pulley on the generator and 
a doghouse cooler.  Had to stop to keep getting cold beverages about every 
hour or two, as we forgot the little cooler, and used the mister bottle - 
excellent low tech air-conditioning.

Stopped in S. Oregon for the night, and didn't get going till 8am Tuesday. A 
bit late as wanted to avoid the heat in the central valley- it was 117F in 
Redding last week.  anyway the damn shiny bus doesn't start with the key 
anymore, and that morning there was an icky rumbly sound when I stepped on 
the clutch, and the clutch shuddered.  D$#%mn!   Well, you don't need a 
clutch much on the freeway.  Took the siskiyoos fine.  The mountains were 
real pretty different shades of blue rising out of the morning haze.  Oil 
temp up to 100C going up, down to 80 cruising down.   Headwind on the CA side 
didn't start till after I though it would, which made things easier.  Stopped 
in Weed for a bite.  It was 94F in Redding.  Stopped at Wolfgang to get the 
core change back from a steering box I got in 1998, and ended up handing 
Steve the cash back and got new TO bearing and clutch and something else and 
he kicked me a TO arm just in case.  Real nice guy.  He commented on the 
stamped bumper on the roof rack, and how the last time I stopped there I had 
a stamped bumper on the roof rack.  Well, it's like american express, don't 
leave home without it.

Headed south and made it to Cupertino uneventfully.  shortly before leaving 
I-80 to go south on 680 the outside temp dropped to under 80F (ah! nice) and 
the oil temp dropped to 85-90C.  it had maxed at just over 100C, maybe 
215-220F.  still so clean it's hard to see the oil level, but I'll change it 
anyway when I pull to motor to inspect the clutch issue.  trip totalled bout 
835miles home to here, and gas milage was less than I liked, about 20MPG.  

ya- any idea on thermal conductivity of different weights of oil?  Also 
thinking about sound deadening to cut down on vibration noise.  might measure 
the pulleys and find the ratio.   It does use a smaller fan belt.
