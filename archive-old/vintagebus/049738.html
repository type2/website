Subject: Re: Tire Sizes (again, sorry in advance)


&gt;I've checked the archive and technical articles but drew a blank.

It's true that the Library section is deficient in tire articles but the
thought that you can't find anything in the Archive section leaves me
gaping.

185/75 or 195/75. The tire with neither peer nor complaint known to exist
is the Yokohama Y356, which is appropriate and commonly available in load
range C but you might want D if you carry loads of rocks or something. This
is what I am getting when I get some money.

I can write a filter that intercepts messages about tires size, you know. I
can. I love to write filters. =^ )
