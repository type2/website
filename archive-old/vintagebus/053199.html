Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel sender question...

Yes, even when I ground the sender to the body with a known good ground,
the needle pegs. If I turn the sender upside down, the gauge wiggles a
bit. Does anyone know the proper resistance for the sender throughout
its range of motion? Also, is it possible to fit a beetle sender on the
bus tank or is the shape too different?
Thanks!
TJ

Hi TJ,
Do you have a ground wire running from the sender to the body?  It is a
must 
have.
