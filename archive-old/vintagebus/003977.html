&gt;The bay window beam into split has been discussed ad nauseum. Plenty of info
&gt;in the archives. For a brief synopsis, it goes like this. 68-69 beam bolts
&gt;into splitties. 71ish torsion arms fit into said beam. They have disc
&gt;brakes. Simple bolt in except that the front of the bus will be a couple
&gt;inches higher.

and so would the front be higher than you would like it ?
and did you also have to lift the saggy rear ( V8) ?
is the whole ride now too high ?
perhaps the rear was re-splined to accomodate the V8
but the front still rides higher...
it would seem better to stuff in the whole front beam,
ignoring the obvious 2-bolt hole savings, in favor of a
more correct ride height. by pushing the beam up those
two inches and making 4  new mounting holes
