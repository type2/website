Only 7? Come on guys. Let's get some emails going to these people. Takes 2
minutes. They act as though it's do-able.

--------------------
&gt;Dear Mr. Rogers,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you very much for your email, and thank you for being understanding
of
&gt;my error. Within the past two days I have received about 7 requests to
&gt;produce a pre-1963 VW Transporter manual. I have forwarded all of these
&gt;emails to our editorial/technical staff. I have also spoken with both teams
&gt;in hopes of advocating your cause. I shall let you know as soon as I get
&gt;word on any decision. Please tell your newsgroup that we do indeed
&gt;appreciate all suggestions and comments. We at Bentley, base our
publication
&gt;decisions largely on customer feedback like yours. 
&gt;We do welcome all suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again,
&gt;
