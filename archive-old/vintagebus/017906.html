Subject: Solvang findings &amp; questions (long)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just got back from the Solvang show.
A pretty damn good show....If you love bugs!
No, actually it was pretty great all around. Some very
very nice cars in every class. Lots of busses too.
This guy Larry from Redwood City has an amazing old
Westy. Original tent, potty with chemicals, some
aluminum cups, and lots more. the tent loos brand
spanking new! Great find, Larry!

Anyway, the swap area was proportionately tiny. But
poking around I came across some things I thought I'd
ask the list about....

I saw 2 diffrent kinds of deluxe coathooks. One kind
was sort of pointy on the ends, and another more
rounded on the ends. Which is early and which is late?
What year did they switch?

Does the door/window post grabhandle mount under these
hooks, using the same screws?

I have a rear seat w/ original carmael brown
upholstery. That places it in the '58 - 61 standard
bus interior range. I want to sell it. What years will
it fit? It was in my '67, so I figure it will go that
late, but how early will it go? TIP: the driver's side
leg is bent in (towards bus center) at the bottom back
before it rises up in front of the
hump/firewall/slope/thingy. What;s up with that?  I
need to know so I can tell potential buyers what year
will go. (anyone want it? $200)

also: SPLASH PAN WARNING!!! I picked up a set of
splash pans, only to find out they were '68 and not
split bus (thanks Wolfsburg West booth guy). Luckily
the swap seller was cool enough to take them back. But
check out your pans before you buy them. On the
correct (split) ones, there is a notch in them about
3+ inches before the inner end (where the overrider
goes) and the mounting bracket nearest the end of the
bumper has a nut welded in it. The later one has an
oblongated hole and a carriage bolt where it bolts to
the bumper near its end. Make sense? Just beware if
you are a stickler for correctness. The late ones will
fit with some mods. (further reading, see: vintage
nazis)

Sorry for the long post, but you know how it is when
you go to a show and you get this rejuvenenation
(rejuvination?) of bus psyche!!!! (See? that's four
exclamation points, pretty major)

Gonna go put my new deluxe rear hatch trim on (the
only remaining piece I needed). It will look cool if I
ever get the bus running. Priorities...hmmm..

Jason
67 21 window &quot;DARTH--runs but no idle and bad gas but
a new rear hatch trim and NOS visor and we will be
having a daughter on Tuesday so who knows when it will
be done but right now it is pretty cool just to sit in
it and have a beer and imagine putting a baby seat in
the middle seat if my wife lets me but not likely
that's why we have the Passat wagon at least its a
VW.--VW&quot;
