Subject: Westi flooring ?

I am just about ready to start the interior of my Westi and was wondering
what board thickness and type is used to go under the linoleum?

I am thinking .25&quot; engineered flat board (basically glued up scrap wood), I
figure the glue will be sturdy enough to handle wetness better than
plywood... Not that I plan on the interior being doused in water though :)

Also does the linoleum run under all the westi interior things or does it
cutout for the closet, bed, fridge, etc?..  I have never seen a &quot;stock&quot;
westi floor before, pitiful, most of them I see are shag carpet or other
mutation... I have seen parquet (sp) floor before which was kind of neat. 

TIA!,
