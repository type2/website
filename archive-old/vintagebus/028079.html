&gt; No offense taken... perhaps I assumed the name.  Its an air powered random 
&gt; orbital sander that takes a sanding disk around 6&quot; in size.  In the past I 
&gt; had used a &quot;sponge like&quot; abrasive disk but they are to costly for large 
&gt; scale work like this.

&gt; &gt;with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; DAC air sander.  Comments/opinions/warnings/rants (you get the idea) on 
&gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; tool and/or grade of paper to use?


Perhaps you are thinking &quot;DA&quot; sander? DA is dual action which enables it
to have the properties of a disc sander or a random orbital sander. This
is a common property in air powered sanders which for some reason doesnt
translate to electric. They are one or the other. 
Has anyone ever seen an electric DA sander?
