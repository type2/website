Subject: Re: [VB] What is this?

Oil on brake shoes is a bad thing, this was an early attempt to keep oil
that got past the axle seal from getting on the shoes.  The long leg would
be mounted facing down and let the oil safely pass out of the brake area.

&gt; What the heck is an oil slinger and what is used for?  I was just browsing
&gt; and saw that thing and never heard of it before.
