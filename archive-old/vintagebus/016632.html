All safaris leak.

Some early american trucks (40's, maybe 50's) had safaris, although they
didn't open as far.

&gt; while we're on the subject of safaris (maybe we're not

&gt; getting them for my Dormobile since i cracked the
&gt; driver's side windsheild while removing it. it would
&gt; be nice to cruise through hillsboro village with the
&gt; windows flyin'. so what are everybody's thoughts on
&gt; safaris? who has them? are they worth the price and
&gt; the leakage? the way i figure is, what other vehicle
&gt; can you put safaris in? i might as well take advantage
&gt; of it if i have the opportunity. let me know what you
&gt; think.
