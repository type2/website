Subject: Re: Oil System Upgrades
Date: Wed, 04 Nov 1998 00:03:40 PST



&gt;I've been thinking of upgrading the oil system of our '67 and am 
looking
&gt;for comments.

OK.
  I'm thinking of adding a sump, then upgrading to the
&gt;doghouse setup from pieces I'm gathering from the local junkyard. Good
&gt;hunting so far - shroud, front tin, cooler, new fan/adapter/seals for
&gt;$60. Next, I want to add the cover plate to the oil pump that allows a
&gt;remote oil filter/cooler.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
One thing at a time. 
The doghouse cooler. Good idea. Put one on my 63. Dropped temp 
considerably. I can go 65 in very hot weather all day at about 210 
degrees, where previously (with in line cooler) I heated up to 230 or 
more.
The sump. Well I never liked the hassle of putting on a sump, but it can 
be done. Besides that, I don't like how a sump can be hit by something 
because it lowers clearance. I also have found through trial and error 
and disscussion that alot of oil just means more oil to heat up, the 
sump doesnt cool it all that much by itself, so if you have a heating 
problem, well, it needs to be taken care of anyway. Good for cornering 
though, oil always there at the pickup tube.
A filter seems like a good idea although there is lots of debate as to 
how to attach the oil lines. Some people like the oil pump attachment, 
many don't. I wont debate it, except to say I don't use one. (Although I 
do have the parts for setting this up lying around).
Finally, the oil cooler. I guess I will say this. Be careful of cooler  
hoses and make sure they dont leak or come off. There is a oil cooler 
attached to my bus, but I don't use it. I never have taken it off, 
should get around to it one of these days. If you use one, consider a 
fan to blow through it when necessary, by a switch, otherwise leave it 
off.
Bottom line....for me the doghouse solved all my problems. Oil temp 
stays low. I don't really think you need more oil capacity, this just 
means you have to change more. I would try the doghouse solution first 
and then see if you need to have more cooling then that.
