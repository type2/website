How about a new friday discussion

This morning I got a call from a Karen who was driving
from Oakland California to meet friends in Austin
Nevada. Seems that Karens VW Bus had a seized
generator and she got my name off the AIRS list. All I
could do was give her a couple of phone numbers to the
'good' repair shops in town. I think just having a
friendly voice on the other end of the phone helped
quite a bit as she called me a couple hours later to
thank me. Seems the shop changed the generator in
quick time and charged her a fair amount($194$). Off
she went without ruining her holiday weekend.

I have had the pleasure of helping three VW Bus
strangers in the last year who got my name off the
AIRS list, once for a lady going back east with an
unknown Bus and just wanting to know how it sounded to
'an experienced Bus owner', a couple of weeks ago, I
helped with a guy named Mick from Aspen Colorado on
his way to SF with a engine concern. Let him stay on
my property and lent him tools which he returned when
done (I was already at work).

The interesting about all three AIRS events with me
was ........They were all Bay Window Busses.....

Maybe the Split Busses - which so many people are
afraid to take on a long trip without a trailer full
of spare parts- are the more reliable VW Bus.
 
Anyways, there hasn't been much discussion of list
members experiences from AIRS related emergency's.

So what say ye...
