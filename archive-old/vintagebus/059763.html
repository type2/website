Subject: Our '61 Westy at OCTO-02

 Hi all,
Thought I'd mention that I uploaded a picture(one &amp; only) of our
'61 Westy at OCTO last Sat. that I have been restoring for years.
It was it's first trip and it drove great.  Some of you might remember
it when it was infested with &quot;The Mutant Bees&quot;!  The pic is located
on thesamba_dot_com under 'campers'.
  Lou &amp; Liz
PS. Next trip 'Jerome Jamberee'
