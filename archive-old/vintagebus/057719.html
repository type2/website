Well, this is interesting.

&gt;
&gt; The company that owns ipprotector_dot_com also provides some (to me) shady

the
&gt; type of company I would expect VWoA to do business with, but I've been

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Scam.
&gt;
&gt; Why?
&gt;
&gt; 1. It came via email.
&gt; 2. It says in a few weeks, I've seen this email for months.
&gt; 3. It says you can respond to the email with REMOVE in the subject =
line,
&gt; this tactic is used to verify you have a valid email and that you have
&gt; read the note in order to contact you further as they see fit.  (Like
&gt; sue you) 4. If it was real, it'd be on vw_dot_com  IPProtector is a BS
&gt; company that bullies people, I doubt if VW even knows they have set =
this
&gt; up.
&gt;
&gt; Anything received via email should be immediately doubted - don't =
delete
&gt; files off your computer, don't forward emails that say &quot;forward this,&quot;
&gt; don't run attachments, don't email people to tell them they are =
infected
&gt; with a virus, and never respond to spam, especially when it says =
&quot;click
&gt; here to remove yourself from our list&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Skepticism, like chastity, should not be relinquished too readily.&quot;
