Huh,

I had three in my '67 Westy alone!  Did you really go through them :)  I
keep one behind the front seat, one on top of the table between front bench
and rear area, a third in rear area hatch camping stuff :)

Subject: [VB] BBtB IV Fire extinguishers?


In previous threads there have been discussions on ire extinguishers.
In my personal poll I only saw about 5 extinguishers in 150 buses.
I have no problem with a temporary fix of punching a hole in the gas tank to

get somewhere important!  But a fire extinguisher is I believe an important 
thingy to carry around.
I apologise in advance if my estimate is wrong.
BTW Arizona buses do not seem to have windshield wiperz!!!
