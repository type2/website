EBAY ITEM #1855502885

This is a set of new, reproduction, still-in-the-box, front Safari windows 
for a VW Microbus, model years 1955-1967. This kit was purchased from 
Wolfgang International (http://www.wolfgangint_dot_com) one year ago, but never 
installed due to simple lack of time. The kit comes complete with white 
powder coated frames, glass, seals, and all necessary window mounting 
hardware. Winning bidder will pay shipping and handling costs. Payment will 
be accepted via PayPal, Certified Check, or Bank Money Order. All sales are 
final. Please feel free to ask me any questions before bidding. Thanks, and 
keep on groovin' Note, as with all of the Wolfgang kits, this kit does not 
include the wiper pivots or the &quot;one-eyed duck.&quot;
