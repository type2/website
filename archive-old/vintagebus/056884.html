Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

Hi Dan,
Install a thermostat if carburetored.  If you have the complete engine with 
Mexi FI which helps control oil temp via leaning out the fuel mixture and 
sensing this with temp sensors.  Plus as you say much of Mexico does not get 
as cold as the USA does.  Also the flaps help to aim cooling air to the 
proper places and if you ever leave you state and end up in weather lower 
than 70F the thermostat will help keep your engine happy and keep you warmer 
with more heat exchanger output.  Especially since you Floridians tend to 
freeze once the outside temps drop below 70F!  ;-)
