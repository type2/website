Ronnie,

I'd have to agree that cable stretch is a consideration. This could be a
problem if you were to use bicycle grade cable but fortunately cable comes
in a wide variety of grades. There are even cables rated for a great deal
more return pressure than would exist in a throttle. Maybe the set up you
recently tossed used a low grade cable? I see no reason why this can't be
done properly.

My goal of course is to have the same idle in the afternoon as there was in
the morning. Any dual carb set up requires syncing periodically. Some
systems may require adjustment less often but it still needs to be checked
at each tune up. It isn't a terrible job. Adjustment every few thousand
miles is simply better than two or three times a day.

I also have to agree with you that the cross bar linkage works fine. Maybe
I'm too picky, but I find all that hardware visually objectionable. Sure
would be a dull hobby if no one ever looked into doing things differently or
trying to execute an idea better. I might fail, but there is certain failure
in not trying.

&gt; I'm never one to through something away but I just through out one of
those
&gt; linkage set-ups that I had removed from an engine. The main problem was
&gt; carbs going out of sync dure to cable stretch and I find the cross bar
&gt; linkage just fine and trouble free.
