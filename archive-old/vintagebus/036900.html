Hmm 200$ bought me LOTS of RUST.
200$ bought me a bus where the brakes seized up on the tow home......
Which brought me an hour at a gas station 200 miles from home.
Which brought lots of white poofy smoke......
200$ bought me a rear tailgate for my 58 single.
I right truck corner.
And a set of taillights......
Still seem like a good deal?

&lt;&lt; Well, I understand paying around $2K for a running bus. What about those
posts about buses for &quot;pennies&quot;? I mean, $200.00 and it runs? Get me a
few then!!! But to be completely honest, before I'll buy a bus I have to
get rid of the project-FIAT that sits in my garage. My wife would have to
be convinced that this is a change for the better too. Problem is I can
only keep so many cars around anyway. I would buy them all  if I could.
Please, keep me in mind and if you stumble upon one that runs and costs
around $200.00 let me know. (yeah! I can see that already, you'll
probably buy it yourself and then sell it for more, ha?) Have fun!
