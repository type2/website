&lt;&lt; Just got my bus on the road in the last couple of weeks after being stored
 in the garage for the winter. Great to be driving it again!!
 
 However, the needle of the gas gauge will read properly one minute and now
 bounce back and forth for 30 seconds at a time. Is it the ground wire?? Sign
 of gauge failure???........... It is not related to bumps in the road and
 had been working properly the last five years......
  &gt;&gt;
probably the ground- I 'd check the ground at the sender and at he guage.
