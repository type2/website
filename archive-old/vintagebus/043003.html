&gt; Are you kidding me? Where you going and how long you going, your gonna need
&gt; Bob's limo for all that stuff if you wanna be comfortable. What about a press
&gt; and brake lathe?

Are you kidding?  I've been carrying all this and more for 25 yrs now, and
all but the fire extinguisher is hidden away out of site! I've never been
stuck more than an hour on the side of the road, and only four times at
that in 25 yrs of driving! Excepting the time i replaced my slipping
clutch disk in the parking lot of the NAPA parts store in Midland TX in
86. That was 3 hours.

You too can be prepared for anything!
