It's just an attitude bit.  I bought a new Passat Wagon GLX with a VR6
engine.  Took that to Santa Barbara a number of times.  It was quicker,
quieter, even better on gas mileage.  But the bus was exciting just in
itself.  If you're well equiped, you've done your maintenance, (or had it
done, in this case) and you make allowances for distractions, the stress of
&quot;Oh my God, am I going to make it?&quot; goes away, and you're left with driving
a classic vehicle, people smiling and waving along the way, and a feeling of
calm that settles upon those who can skip the latest and the greatest and
enjoy a simpler life.

Whoa.  The soapbox is tipping...
