Hi all -

I stumbled upon an interesting license plate 
at a thrift shop yesterday. It was an Iowa plate 
for a non-resident, in transit, 1954, white letters
on black.

At least it appeared to be such.  Upon it was 
NON-RES. 
TRANSIT
in addition to the letters/numbers.

The year was formed into the plate, not an add-on.

I checked e-Bay for something similar to find 
nothing with the search I used. 
Could be there though.

It was $20 for the pair.

Anyone interested?

Jeff
