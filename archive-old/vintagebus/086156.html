While you can do a straight up install of the 62-67 tank in a no gas guage 
bus, I would definately keep the reserve tap.   It is nice to have that 'there 
is only one gallon left' notice, as gas guages are not always exactly accurate. 
 :)  Plus you can shut off the gas for engine pulls or fuel line replacement, 
which helps to avoid fuel pouring on you and fire risk.   The fuel tap will 
attach to a later tank just like an earlier one.

Personally, I find the lack of gas guage in 61 &amp; earliers no problem.   I 
also keep a record book with fill-ups in each bus.   And the reserve does give 
you pre-run-out notice.  I have considered retrofitting a fuel tap in a gas 
guage bus, actually, just never got around to it.

If you really want the guage, I'd keep the tap, and install the guage in a 
bracket rather than cutting the dash.
You need to pull the motor to replace the tank.

&lt;&lt; Good morning all!

I am working on this 60 bus, it is pre-gas gauge era.

Anyone ever retro-fit a later tank with a gas gauge in

one of these early splits? To me, it seems like it

would be as easy as puttin in the new tank with a

sender, intsalling a gauge on the dash and running the

wires as normal?? Am I over-simplifying this

retro-fit, is it really as easy as it seems to me???

If so, anyone want to trade a later split tank with

sender for an early split tank with the reserve tap included?? &gt;&gt;
