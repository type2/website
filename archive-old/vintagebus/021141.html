Subject: re:[VB] Optima Batteries - a downside...

I refuse to give Optima another dollar! Check the
archives under my name and optima for prior
discussions. Root issue is the expensive outlay for
&quot;the best&quot; for the then new resto 67Westy. Fast fwd a
few years to me standing at the counter of the same
retail vendor being told that there was a $75. core
prorate fee for another 'spensive battery. Switch
channels to be standing in line at WalMart purchasing
a  72Month no questions asked battery for about $40.
End of subject.
