Subject: help needed with barndoor rear brakes 

Anyone got a diagram of how to put together barndoor rear brakes?
For some reason I can't figure it out.....I ended up with six tension
springs when i think I'm only supposed to have 4?
Anyone got a pic so I can get my 54 back together?
I shoulda paid mo attention when i was taking it apart.
I also need one of the little oil splash tubes (goes form center of drum to
outside by a little metal tube) for inside the rear drum.
Thanks-
Regards,

&gt;Subject: [VB] steering column colour?Re: [VB] touch-up paint
&gt;Date: Sat, Sep 22, 2001, 11:17 PM
&gt;

&gt;the white steering column in a bus, is that the white of the interior of the 
&gt;bus, like say a 65 westy with blue white in the cab, is that the steering 
&gt;column colour, or did they have a satck of steering columns blacked black and 
&gt;a stack painted white they threw in.  the latter seems more likely, think the 
&gt;column was painted before installation,
&gt;
&gt; but what color white?  matched the bumpers silver white?  would the white be 
&gt;the same on say a 61 and a 65?
