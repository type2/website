I've been thru this several times now.  *I* know the process, but
*they* don't; every time the introduce some new quirk.  This time
was special!  They had several quirks:

* they didn't know what form I needed
* when found, they only had one copy and she wasn't sure if she should give it to me
* they thought I was supposed to take in the pink slip
* they had issues with the condition of the plates (NOS) - they thought they were fake.  I had the original envelope with Edmund G Brown's signature on it (&quot;Who's he?&quot;)
* they had issues with the condition of the sticker (NOS) - they thought it was fake
* they had issues with the metallurgy of the plates - they thought they were supposed to be aluminum
* they had issues with the actual serial - I have commercial plates
* they had issues with the size of the plates - this stumped me.
* their instructions said not to remove the stickers from the plates, which caused confusion as there were no stickers on the plates.
* there was a camera crew there filiming for a news segment (ch 10), which really had them freaked.  My first teller bolted  - literally got up and ran to the back room - when the guy set the camera up!

Now to go home and bolt 'em on!  I picked up a &quot;Lotterman&quot; license plate
frame at the OCTO show.

&gt; It's not tough...but you just need to know you're right so you can
&gt; effectively argue when they want to destroy your plates. They seem to want
&gt; to do that often...that's what they tried on me too.
