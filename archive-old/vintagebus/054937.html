&gt;Coil is good, the wire sparks when the engine is turned.
&gt;I BELIEVE that I may not be getting a spark at the spark plugs though.
&gt; So please give a list of possible problems that would cause no spark at the plugs.
&gt;BTW, has new coil, spark plug wires, plugs.

Did you leave the rotor out ?
Is there a carbon contact in the inside top of the distributor ?
