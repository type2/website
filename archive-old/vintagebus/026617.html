Lenny went nuts with this one.A prominate bus guru had welded in the doglegs on
this one prior to Lenny getting it .
He had used later doglegs(two piece),Lenny couldn't stand it and cut them out
and fabicated 3 piece doglegs.
The lower 10 inches of that bus are fabricated.The deluxe belly pans were
fab'd.The interior is THE BOMB!
 This bus shows the pride Lenny has in his work.
