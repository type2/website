Subject: Bosch date coding

A gentleman came over to my house last weekend to purchase some 36hp warm-up parts.  He noticed a thin-slot generator I had picked up for my '55 Kombi on my workbench and proceeded to show me how to read the date code stamped on its body.  I did not realize they were date stamped so imagine my surprise when it was stamped 7L, which equates to July, 1955, fairly close to the production date of my Bus.  He stated that the majority of Bosch products were stamped with a date code where the # is the number of the month and the years begin in 1945, where:

1945 = A
1946 = B
