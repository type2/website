Hi Kevin &amp; David,
Now that is interesting to know!  Also the fact that silcone will break loose 
in the VW due to body flex.  We have tried that, grease, and 3M body sealant. 
 All but the last only kept out the rain for only three months.  The 3M 
product made it almost impossible to insert the window/seal into the frame 
due to its thick/sticky consistancy.  Roofing tar is not only a great 
lubricant, is the only material that actually repels rust and will reseal 
when the sun come out if you went off road and flexed your VW badly.
