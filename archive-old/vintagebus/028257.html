 Ebay madness I'm hoping.  It is a Brekina model of a VW truck for over 
$1,000 
 bucks!!  Am I missing something here?

very cool truck,   turquoise too.  With the Vespa logo on the tarp.  I used 
to ride a Vespa.  Vespas are cool.   You could drive a decent ways on 11c of 
gas in theeighties.    Kind of a two in one deal.

  But the high bid was 33.99 from what I saw.
