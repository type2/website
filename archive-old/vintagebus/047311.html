Well, someone had to do it, right?

DUDE!!!  Got anymore beer, dude?  (Those who hung out with us at all at Jerome
will understand that last statement)  :)

Anyway, Matt and I decided to take off from CA Wednesday night, stay at my
parents in Phx Thursday, and head up to Jerome Friday afternoon. We got there
around 4PM and found John Howard and our highly prized 67 big nut tranny.  We
made the transaction and had 5 or 6 guys help us heft the thing onto our Home
Depot wood roofrack specially made for transmission hauling :)  John should
have a really cheesy picture of Matt and I standing next to the GTi with dumb
&quot;we just got a tranny&quot; grins on out faces. 

We were supposed to save a spot near the edge of the campsite for VanBondo,
who was leaving Phx &quot;no later than 2PM&quot;  Well, at midnight or so he rolled in
being towed by a F**d...we had dutifully been sitting by our campfire all
evening saving that coveted edge spot for him and Paula, so they set up camp
and we all went to bed.  2AM rolls around, and the &quot;Dudes&quot; roll in and decide
they need to camp by us.  They started singing &quot;happy birthday Mr. President&quot;
to someone and it went downhill from there...not much sleep that first night.

Saturday morning we woke to some kid screaming &quot;HEY VOLKSWAGEN PEOPLE!!&quot; and
throwing large rocks down the hill opposite from camp.  That was VERY nice at
6:15 AM.  We got up and drove into Cottonwood for supplies so we could get
back before the caravan arrived.  They all got there about 11 or so, and we
stood on the edge of the campsite and watched all the busses try and make it
up the HUGE hill in 2nd gear...HA HA HA HA HA!!!  There were a few that had to
resort to letting someone else climb into the driver's seat and get their
busses up that monster hill.  

Saturday during the day we just kinda hung out...we met a few listees and
chatted with them (it's nice to finally be able to put faces with names).  The
highlight of the day had to be hearing Kyle (67 Westfailure) say &quot;boy, you
better go over there and practice fallin down and bleedin, and I'll be over in
a few minutes to kick your ass&quot; about some young 'uns camped near him who
insisted on pretending there was a car stereo competition.  There was a
torrential downpour that lasted all of 3 minutes in the middle of the
afternoon...just enough to keep the dust down.  At dinnertime we grubbed on
Paula Ellis's chilli (YUM) and then wandered around camp talking to people.  

Saturday evening we sat around the campfire with VanBondo and Paula and
Everett, that Barndoor guy  :)  Our conversation slowly degenerated into
saying &quot;Duuuuuude&quot; a lot and laughing   LOL  There was a HUGE bongo drum
circle in the middle of camp, so we wandered over to check that out.  Pretty
cool, people with flutes, fiddles, cowbells, even a guy hitting non-
instruments with a stick.  We felt like party poopers when we hit the sack
around 10PM, but hey, we'd had little or no sleep the night before.  

After a much needed night's sleep, we stumbled out of the tent around 8AM
Sunday.  Sunday is the clean up day at Jerome, so we tore down our campsite
and waited for raffle bus time.  The bus they gave away this year was
NICE...MUCH better shape than the one I won :)  A lady who had put only $10 or
$20 into the raffle won it.  I guess it was her first bus, and she was
thrilled to have it.  Nice to see another happy bus owner.  Soon after the
raffle we made sure the tranny was strapped down tightly and headed out for
Phx.  All in all it was a great weekend...not too sunburned, met a lot of nice
people (including a bunch of listees), and it was great to see a couple
hundred busses in one place, a lot of which were splittys.  

Our goal is to have our bus done (driveable) by the next Jerome, so the damn
AZ Bus Club will stop bothering me about getting the raffle bus back on the
road  :)  Hopefully next year all the listees can look for Matt and Katie in
the primer 1960 kombi!!  

Ok, sucky trip report done.

Katie and Matt
