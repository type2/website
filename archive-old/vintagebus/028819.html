Subject: Re: [VB] Rev limiting distributor rotor arm?

They're a stock bus distributor rotor.  Got on in my '77.  Had one in my '62. 
The correct rotor for a bus.   Bosch.  Got it at NAPA. (The only game in
town.)  They had to order it, but it only took a day.  Cost about $30-35. 
Lasted for 40k miles so far.  The cheap, non-rev limiting ones are usually the
first one offered because most volks choke at the price of the correct one.
Keep one of those cheap ones in the tool box, just in case...
