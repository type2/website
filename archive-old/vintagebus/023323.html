Hi Al,
Well there is good news and bad then.  Those mirrors are rather on the rare 
side.  Probably as rare as the proper harp standard mirrors.  The only rarer 
VAG or VOA issued bus mirror would be the harp mirrors with convex glass!  
  Best bet would probably be to have yours rechromed.  We looked for a set of 
these mirrors for a fellow up here.  It took over five years to find a pair 
new or used.  Finally found one (NOS) and then another one (NOS) three months 
later.  We have looked for more in the last two years and have had no luck so 
far.   Eric&amp;Barb
