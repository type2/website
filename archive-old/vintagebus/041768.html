Isaiah do you have the OBR Dave Easterwood article?? If not I can mail it
to you. Are you a NEATO member? If not join even just for the newsletters.
According to the acticle for small nut boxes the std bearing part #s
6306  3 pcs (311501283)
6305  1 pc  (211501285)
You should be able to source those bearings with those std part #s.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; does anyone have the dimensions for the outer and/or inner lower
&gt; bearing(s) on the small nut redux boxes?
&gt; the lower outer bearing is part # 311 501 283.  There is a bearing shop
&gt; here in town and I'd like to see if I can get the bearing locally before
&gt; ordering one...  I'm trying to get this thing back on the road ASAP.  I
&gt; was talking to a VW shop here...and the guy thinks that the outer is a
&gt; standard bearing that I should be able to get from a bearing
&gt; shop....does anyone have these bearings laying around they could get the
&gt; numbers off of?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot for your help guys/gals.  I appreciate it.
