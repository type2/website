&gt;&gt;I've got some stuff at home that may or may not be worth scanning.
&gt;
&gt;I will defer to those more knowledgeable on the list re which may be more 
&gt;worth scanning than others.

From the &quot;about&quot; page for the doc project...

  The goal of this project is to put these hard-to-find technical 
  reference materials online, including parts reference manuals,
  specifications manuals, part rebuild specs/procedures, tools
  manuals, and etc.

Besides Andrew's comments about copyright, I think the main criteria are,
1) does it relate to an air-cooled VW and 2) do we have it already.
For example, right now we have '69 and '73 Without Guesswork manuals,
covering December '53 to October '72.  We'd probably prefer to scan a
Without Guesswork that covers dates outside that range, if one is
available.  We also have Barndoor and post-'58 Bus parts manuals, but
nothing for the '55-'57 Buses.  I know that (say) a '52 parts manual
might have parts that were superseded by the time the '54 manual came
out, but I think it would be more helpful at first to cover as many
years as possible before getting into the fine details of when the
111A changed into a 111B.

I hope this helps!
