There seems to be some still missing.  I know my bus has/had the following
at some time in its life:

MX-119 - Beetle muffler (cough, cough) in place of bus muffler
MX-125 - Cut rear wheel wells/install large off-road tires
MX-129 - Multi-colored hand-applied paint
MX-131 - Remove jack, leave in garage
MX-132 - Remove lug wrench, leave in garage
MX-142 - Delete rubber engine air seals (requires MX-143 and MX-144)
MX-143 - Install extra cooling scoops
MX-144 - Install external oil cooler on side of bus
MX-150 - Install standard-load tires
MX-172 - Dent front sheet metal and install front spare tire mount.

but before it came to me, it had the following unknown M-Codes added:

MX-019 - Install early bus centrifugal advance distributor
MX-??? - Re-install typ2 muffler, leaving ugly cut-outs in rear apron
MX-??? - Install fiberglass flares on cut-out wheel wells

I have eliminated 131, 132, 142, 143, 144 and 150, but the rest are still
pending, since this is my daily driver, body work is something that has to
wait.
