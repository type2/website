Subject: clutch cable issue?

My clutch pedal has not been springing back properly, and I've been leaking
a lot of transmission fluid.

I had problem with the clutch before, and replaced a broken spring at the
clutch operating lever, and at the same time discovered that the clutch
pedal assembly desperately needed lubing. I did all that. It worked great,
for about 2 years.

Now the pedal seems to be binding again, so I've got to remove the clutch
pedal assembly. To remove the pedal assembly, I've got to disconnect the
cable at the operating lever(right near transmission). Unfortunately when I
spin the wing nut, the cable just spins. I've tried to put a vise grip on
the cable, then to spin the wing nut. I'm not having very much luck. I've
sprayed it with penetrating oil, and plan on tackling it again either later
today or tomorrow. But I was wondering if you all had suggestions on getting
this wing nut off.

As for the tranny fluid leak-It actually appears to be coming from in front
of the transmission-where the shift linkage goes into the transmission. Is
there a seal in there? I've only ever replaced the seal inside the
transmission housing(rear of transmission) where the splined shaft protrudes
through the case.

It also appears as though I tightened the fill nut on the tranny a little
too tight. I'm having trouble getting it loose. Any suggestion on this also
appreciated. Are there any possible detrimental effects to spraying
penetrating lubricant on this nut? I don't know if this oil would possibly
contaminate the tranny fluid. Then again I can't imagine more than a drop
getting in.
