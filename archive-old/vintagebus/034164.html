WCM makes the split bug look for the new beetle
anything to try to make it real.
next (bus content) they'll come out with decals to make a new beetle look
like a split'

A few months ago I was at Circle K and 2 VW LT's pulled up in the parking
lot, between them what was appeared to be a mini van of sorts but heavily
camouflaged, I asked the driver what it was but they didn't speak English,
nice looking German girl though, both LT's where heavily decked out with
test gear. then a few weeks ago my wife saw what she said looked like a
modern split driving down the street. Could VW be testing the new bus out
here in our desert heat?

It's a plastic sheet like window tinting. You can see right through 
the graphics which is pretty cool. I was contemplating getting a New 
Beetle, designing the rear section of a split bug and doing that over 
the rear window to give it that Vintage look...

As far as removal goes...it depends. They make all different styles a 
levels of adhesive. It can be semi-permanent, but it is mostly like a 
really strong Post-It Note. When you see City buses with this &quot;wrap&quot; 
they need to be able to remove it easily for the next advertiser.
