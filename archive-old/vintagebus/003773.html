Hi,

That faint glow is perfectly normal. It will occur with an alternator as
well as with a generator. My bus has been doing it since it was new in 64. I
remember driving down the highway to go camping with my dad at the wheel
worrying about that light.

 I am sure that if I did a full circuit analysis of the bus electrical
system I could find the answer. But, why try, those VW engineers must have
made it that way for a reason.

Chris
