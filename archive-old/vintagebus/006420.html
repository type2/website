Subject: solid rear window hatch and cut gut

 Thom, why didn't you say you were looking for a solid window rear early
hatch? Had 1 off the 60 swivel seat panel that I parted. Tried to cut it to
install a rear window and messed it up, so into the dumpster it went. JUST
KIDDING, but I see you are getting great use out of your Eastwood edge
roller tool just like I am, one of the best tools I have ever bought.
 Wife went to a cooking party tonight and I'm setting here trying to think
of something to jump start the list again, but can't. Did have a close call
at work today though. Stupid backhoe operator though he would break off a 10
foot piece of 2&quot; pvc with the bucket and it snapped and a 3 foot piece hit
me in the gut ( lots of padding) and cut my shirt and belly (about 3&quot; long)
and bounced off. About 2 inches above the taco oil burn scar from Jerome. My
belly is getting close to looking like my 63 buses front end (bus content).
A few more scares and I will have a neat VW scar on me. Lets see Kyle top
that!
 Hope to see all you Nor Cal listies at Kelly Park in April. Show you my
scars and apron.

 John Howard
