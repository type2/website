Subject: Re: [VB] New Bus!  '66 Standard-Issue Rustbucket

Congrats on the new bus!!!!

I've found that a large axe comes in handy for rescuing old buses.    loosen 
lugs, Jack up bus, brace securely.   Log rounds are good.  Remove rim, pound 
on outside circle rim of drum with blunt end of axe.  pound in a few different 
places, like front and back.  You want the axe with the long handle, not the 
puny hand axe.   An 8lb mallet with long handle also works.   Lift the large 
pounding device with both hands, legs braced, aim carefully (miss your own legs, 
are you wearing sturdy jeans and boots?, and miss any friends nearby) and  
aim through the drum, yelling loudly:

  &quot;Live!!! you son of an unwashed she-goat!!!&quot; (thwack!!) 
&quot;YOU! (thwunk!) lousy! (thwunk!) rusting chunk! (thunk!) of crusty rust!!!! ( 
thwunck!) 
&quot;Churning urn! (thwuk) of burning funk!&quot; (thwunk)
&quot;I'm doing this for your own good&quot; (thwunk!)  
&quot;Sweet little bus, now be nice!&quot; (diinngggg!!!!!!!!!!!) 

When the sound of the pounding changes from a dull 'thwunk' to a resonating 
'diinnggggg', the shoes have come loose from the drum.   Kinda loosens up the 
upper back as well. 

I think I have some spare drums if you need them

The fifth addition to my bus herd arrived today...it didn't want to come at
first, but I think it will be happier with other (running) buses than moping
forlornly under redwoods, waiting for the earth to take it back (which
process is pretty well under way) .

All wheels were locked up tight.  It didn't take too long for me to get the
rear ones loose, but the fronts were another story.  I had to do bad things
to make them turn.  I bent the backing plates away, and squirted LW, and
banged on the metal of the shoes through the lug holes and the adjustment
holes.  Got them barely turnable to be able to move them all the way around
by hand, and then towed.  I killed the threads of one lug hole on each drum
by using an allen wrench as a thing to bang on, and possibly the drums are
toast because I used the cold chisel and BFH method to entice the drums to
start moving.  Maybe salvageable, but maybe not.  The backing plates are
burnt toast.
