Subject: Almost done!  Shasta Trip Report

Hey!

I've just about completely completed the write-up for the Shasta Snow Trip
that occurred early February.  Ya, I know, I'm slow, but I was trying to be
thorough.  But I'm not quite done yet!  So, if you're the type who would
only look at it once (there's a lot of sequential pages to load), then
ignore this message and move on...

I'll have video clips soon, and a few other stills, and a bit of text
editing to do.  Please only view it as it is if you promise to come back!
