Subject: bus insurance Replacement value USA ???

Almost got hit again this weekend and started to think about insurance
again......
I just got done searching the archives and wanted some current info.  If any
one has insurance for replacement cost of your bus not ACV.  Please let me
know the Co. I live in South Carolina so any national co would be better for
me. I do not want antique ins as I DRIVE my bus.  I just want to try and
replace her if something happens.  My ins co, USAA, refuses to do anything
other than ACV.  I had a long argument with the lady that Actual Cash value
should be what I would actually have to pay to get one.  Make sense to any one
else.  You try finding a decent '65 21 window deluxe and tell the seller
you'll pay him blue book for it.  If there are any takers out there let me
know. I don't mind getting her appraised but USAA didn't even want to go for
that.

Sorry to vent but I just want to protect my baby and the Ins co's don't want
to help.  I tried calling a couple of the numbers from the last time this
thread came up and they were either for trailer queens or would not insure in
my state.

Please help me.....
