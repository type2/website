 I would get some but I am

My kombi has original door rubbers harvested from wrecks. They were
carefully superglued together by the PO(a super cheap hippy mate of mine)
and they are great. He did a lot of travelling in the bus and collected bits
wherever he came across wrecks. It looks like there are enough lengths of
original profile rubbers in a box in the bus to cobble together a set for my
Dcab as well.

The 'skin' on the original rubber cleans up really well and soaking it in
warm water/glycerine for a while helps to restore some suppleness to it. 

Later
