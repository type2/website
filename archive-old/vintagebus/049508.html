Subject: rebuilding or not

While I agree that rebuilding an engine 'for the experience and hell of it'
ain't too good if that engine is gonna be a daily driver, there is another
way: build a USED PARTS  Emergency Spare Motor.
I am currently doing just this: a good used case (PO junked it because of
rot on the sump, never been bored before tho), a nice set of heads I had
lying around, a set of P&amp;Cs that came off the $300 junker I picked up
(daily driver my ass! the guy had shredded the cam w/ the wrong oil pump
style AND put the pistons in at random. i got a great tranny, all kinds of
interior stuff a beam and four NEW tires outta him tho), some rods and a
crank that came from a bus that a rear-ender had cracked the case (while
parked), even some servicable used bearings - a digital micrometer helps
here.

You get the idea.  New stuff I put in (valves, oil pump, followers etc) has
cost ~$125. I'm going to have an engine to put in the s/c to move it around
instead of pushing it when working on it, an emergency spare that I can
fetch and install if I break down in town, and a backup for when I tear
down the engine in the daily driver.

Most important, I am LEARNING like crazy on this thing.  It helps to have a
guru, admittedly, but I do have a much better understanding of how this
beast is put together - come a dread day when the main engine breaks, I'll
have a far clearer idea of what's wrong and how to fix it.

And I'll know whether or not paying $1300 for a new 1600 is a smarter idea
than building a new one for ME as an individual...
