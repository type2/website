Hi AL,
Is that comparison from tranny to tranny or perhaps by your memory of when 
the engine and it's clutch system was bolted to the old tranny?  The clutch 
system definitely adds more return to the clutch pedal.

&lt;&lt; I am replacing the spring, when i get the damn lever off!  &gt;&gt;

Well if it is stuck you really need it off so you do not have to do this 
later when you do not have the time.  You might just want to cut off the 
clutch throwout arm inside the bellhousing to get it out of the way.  Also 
make sure whichever TO arm you use that it has a bead of weld around the base 
of each the TO arms or risk having them break off!  Make sure the TO bearing 
is centered on the inputshaft to prevent ruining the TO arms, bearing and 
even the pressure plate itself!  We have had to shim some of the TO shafts to 
one side to center the TO bearing and a tiny bit of arm bending can be used, 
but too much bending raises the TO bearing upwards too much inrelation to the 
inputshaft.  

&lt;&lt; Wish I checked that before trans install! Hindsight= 20-20 &gt;&gt;

Hindsight almost always is!   Eric&amp;Barb
