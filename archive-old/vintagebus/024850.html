Bradley,
I don't know what used gauges are going for, and I don't know if it's
12v (you should probably e-mail seller), but there's a gauge on E-Bay
at:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=78276057

I don't have any affiliation with the seller, just came across it after
reading your post. It's currently at $15.50 with a couple days left on
bidding.

BTW: 12v was an option from '64 on (correct year, Clara?), so there are
older gauges that should be 12v (unless VW used a voltage drop, which I
doubt). 

Paul Doubek

&gt; registered dutifully up until the end.  so it looks as if I'll have to
&gt; install a 67 gauge since that was the only pre-68 year for 12 v.  of
&gt; course, I'm not terribly interested in an aftermarket anything, but
