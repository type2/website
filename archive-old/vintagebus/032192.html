&gt;Im sure VW would &quot;jump through hoops&quot; to sell you a shop truck though.

I agree. I would guess that most were just exterior repaints,
but...again...if you wanted to go whole hog you could repaint the interior
cab (or the cargo area) too. Personal preference! So, Thom...I would say to
go with what makes you happy. You'd probably want to do the whole
enchilada, no? Unless you had evidence that the bus was &quot;originally&quot; one
way or the other.
