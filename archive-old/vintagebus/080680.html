Subject: Great Arizona camp out! - Thanks to Fahvergnattix

I just wanted to thank all the VWonderful volks who attended the Seven
Springs campout this year for making my first appearance to the event a fun
and memorable one! For our Arizona subscribers, this event is hosted by
Fahvergnattix VW Club, but open to all attendees who can make it.

Also present were members of Horizontally Opposed, The Arizona Bus Club and
I think even a Flat Four Fetish member (still alive and kicking?). We all
shared food, drink and fun for three excellent days of rest and relaxation
in the cool(er) regions of Arizona's high country.

Many thanks go out to Jerry, Melissa, Randy, Dennis, JD, Jim, et al for your
hospitality, advice and spirit. We'll see you at the next event!
