Subject: RE: [VB] Moab, Utah, BUS HELP/update

I had to do this once when I broke down in Fargo ND. As far as I could tell, a 
plugged up carb jet leaned out #2 cylinder and burned my exhaust valve. If I 
were driving a Ford, Chevy or John Deer I would have been set. As it was we 
limped to Svea MN (about 180 mi) where I had a relative with a garage and an 
adress for UPS'd parts.

ah good times, good times

my guess would be pull the pushrods &amp; pull the plug. Then pray.
