Subject: engine identification

How do I identify the later type1 case (with the larger oil passages,
right?) Is there anything I can readily see or feel for on an engine
in a junked car that would tell me? I am going to the junkyards
looking for an engine to rebuild for the engineless '67 kombi, any
pointers towards picking a good candidate would be appreciated,
thanks.
