It is a well known fact that Hippies loved the VW busses. I think we have 
Hippies to thank, in no small part, to the sheer number of busses available 
in the marketplace today. How much less might their numbers be had 'Hippies' 
not embrassed the venerable bus that we know and love which must have led to 
increased popularity and demand. 

Maybe what some fellow list members object to is not so much Hippies in 
general but the type of Hippie bus that was kept in disrepair and therefore 
effectively a nuisance to society by nature of it's unsightliness. I would 
have to agree that our beloved busses should be well looked after and present 
an excellent image to others which in turn encourages them to get into the 
hobby and lifestyle that bussing offers.
