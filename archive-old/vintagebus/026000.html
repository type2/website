Hello Volks,

Got the alternator installed last night. I found the ends to the harness
that goes between the alternator and the external regulator, so wiring
between the two was easy. 

So far, I've driven the &quot;Lazarus Tranny&quot; to my brother-in-law's house
and back (about 2 miles) and to work and back (about 20 miles). I've
been warned by a couple of gurus on this list that the tranny won't last
10 miles... I plan on driving it to work and back for a couple of days,
then changing the tranny oil... Who knows? Maybe it will last till I can
afford to get the other tranny fixed.

Now I have to address a problem with the clutch. I wasn't having a
problem with it before the tranny change, but I've pulled the engine and
inspected the throwout arm (the only part that has changed), and it
looks ok. Hmmm... Also have to fix a broken exhaust stud. I'll pull the
engine again sometime this week and fix those problems, while changing
the tranny oil.

Last but not least, sometime this week I'll be having my son's '67 15
window Deluxe towed to my house from my bro-in-law's. My son is anxious
to get started on it, and it will be a good way to spend time with him
next weekend.

david
