&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; According to Thom's website (www.vintagebus_dot_com), the last year of the
&gt; semaphore was in 1956.  Is it possible that this is for models to a
&gt; certain location.  I have a '59 with semaphore slots.  Were these posts
&gt; welded in later or were they using left overs?  Is it possible that some
&gt; '59's going somewhere still had them?
