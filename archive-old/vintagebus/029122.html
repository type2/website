&gt; Street concours would be a good compromise.  I'm tired of seeing
&gt; &quot;show winning&quot; cars which are basically just a bunch of chrome goodies
&gt; and cheesy display props.
&gt; 
&gt; This begs the question; who is qualified to judge this?  We've already
&gt; seen how clueless a lot of the current judges are.

&gt; &gt; Step up to the plate Doug, start the class, find the judges and maybe at the

&gt; &gt; long overdue in the VW world.

Actually there are a few of us that are well qualified. Thom, Ty Hodges and
Clara come immediately to mind...  However...  From my experience of VW shows,
most seem to want a 'people's choice' style of judging.  This is well and good
but the net result is that correct restoration counts for very little.  Lisa
and I have judged  a few concours d'elegance at the Palm Springs Vintage Races
and at Deer Park in Escondido.  It is not difficult and mostly it requires two
things. 1.) at least one member of each judging team should be very
experienced in what is 'original' in the vehicles being judged. 2.) all judges
must have a 'critical' eye.  One also must be willing to chance upsetting the
owner's by asking questions regarding a particular vehicles originality.  A
good example of this would be the 165-15 Michelin X tyres on a 'restored' '65
type 1.  Are they original?  Probably not.  Are they 'correct&quot;? Undoubtedly. 
No points off.  165/70-15 Michelin XCH tires?  Points off.  Not available in 1965.

Another necessity is a score card for each car.  Said card assumes that all
judged cars are 100 point cars to begin with.  Points are deducted for
variations from new.  i.e.: 1 point off for each stainless steel worm drive
hose clamp (no manufacturer ever used 'em. (too expensive!) Crimp on wiring
connectors.  More points off.  You just walk around the car, peer under it,
look under the hood and in the trunk.  Ask the owner to start it.  Fill out
the sheet and move on.  At Palm Springs, takes about 15 minutes a car.  At the
end of the judging the Chief Judge and their assistants tally up the results. 
If a tie, the Chief Judge and their staff go and look over the tied vehicles
and do their own sheet.  Their findings are final.  In a close show, you have
to get REALLY anal.  

It's a lot of fun, and trophies received from a 'real' judging have some
meaning.  Optionally, the judging sheets can be given to the owners so that
they KNOW where their car is deficient.  That way, each show moves the cars
closer to perfection. 

And we've seen 100 point cars.  (1965 Mustang. 17 miles since new. Stored in
an air conditioned shop for thirty years.  Just driven on and off the
transporter.  100 point car? Yup.  Some 80 point cars are better!)

For the 'standard' in correct judging, Go to the Professional Car Society's
