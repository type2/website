     All this talk of bearings brings up a question I've had for a month
or 
     so.  I have recently received two different catalogs showing a
strange 
     looking tool for greasing bearings.  I t fits onto your grease gun
and 
     is advertised to evenly force grease into the bearing.  Anyone try 
     this and know it to work?  I truly enjoy the old method and have
never 
     had any problems with it but can't resist a new tool if it really 
     works.


I don't klnow about the effectiveness of that tool, but my favorite tool
for the job is a zip-lock bag.  Dump in a wad of grease followed by the
bearing.  Zip it up and mush it all down into a corner so you can force
grease in all points at once.  Virtually.  Much less messy as well...
