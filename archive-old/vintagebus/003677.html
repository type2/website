I have noticed that I too tend to drive at a speed that is&quot;comfortable&quot; in
my '66.  Most of the time it is below the speed limit but, people who pass
me don't seem to have the same attitude that they would if I was driving
that slow is a &quot;regular&quot; car.  Smiles when they see the van rather than
fingers.

&gt; &gt;&gt;i drive slower - my 71 i was always pushing the envelope in, 70 on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;highway.  But in my 61, i am happy to go whatever speed, it just feels
&gt; &gt;&gt;right no matter how fast or slow i go.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I envy you for being able to drive your split as mine is taking
longer
&gt; and longer than expected to get back on the road but I do know that when
&gt; driving the 58 ghia with it's 36 hp engine, I don't really mind being
passed
&gt; by the trucks going up long hills... yes, life seems simpler and more
&gt; carefree in an old VW.
