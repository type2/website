So, is &quot;below the beltline&quot; relative to the lower edge of the
three-inch-or-so belt that runs along the sides of a bus, or relative
to the upper edge?  I'm seeing some hints that an under layer of paint
was done from the upper edge down, but the current layer is from the
lower edge down.  Since I'm probably going to be getting the whole
thing re-done, might as well get it done right....

Thanks.
