Subject: Re: [VB] 1960 Bus question

&gt;I was over at a guys house yesterday that owns a 1960 Bus.  It still had
&gt;the original transmission in it due to low mileage.  The owner said that
&gt;1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case tranny.  He
&gt;reported that this was normal for the early tunnel-case transmissions,
&gt;sort of an in-between thing.  I was surprised, I thought once the
&gt;tunnel-case came around, all forward gears had synchros.  True or False?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Everett Barnes


Sounds fishy to me.  The first gear syncros didn't last as long as the rest
of the tranny, and my thinking is that bus syncros wear even faster than
Bug ones, maybe due to the different gearing (due to the reduction boxes).
So, his first gear syncro is probably just shot, but he doesn't want to
admit it.

Just my opinion.
