Subject: Re: [VB] Good place to order parts.

John,

Where you need to go depends a lot on what kind of parts you are looking 
for.  Here are some places I normally go:

Kymco VW - stock and performance engine parts
http://www.kymcovw_dot_com

CB Performance - stock and performance engine parts
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com

Painter's Grinding - performance engine and machining
http://www.paintersgrinding_dot_com

California Import Parts - stock engine, body, and electrical
http://www.cip1_dot_com

Bus Boys - engine, body, suspension, and just about anything (BEST service)
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com

Rocky Mountain Motorworks - big clearninghouse for other people's products
http://www.motorworks_dot_com

Pimpride - engine and body
http://www.vwispwest_dot_com

These should get you started.  I look forward to seeing the sites others 
might point out.

  Recently I ordered some parts from busdepot_dot_com. It was terrible. They
sent the wrong stuff(actually screwed up the order so bad it was pathetic)
and weren't the most coperative with me trying to straighten out the order
and get what I needed. I need a place that will take care of me and send the
correct parts out quickly. Don't mind paying the price it takes.
Thanks
John
