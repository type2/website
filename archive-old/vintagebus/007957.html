Subject: Re: [VB] Engine starting kit

[...]

I looked in the RMMW catalog I have.....didn't see the VL16-001 but I did notice
on the starter page that they list bushings...... BUT why do they charge a $1
core charge on a bushing?!?

From: &quot;Ronnie Feitelson&quot; &lt;Ronnie_at_OldVolks_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Call Rancho Trans  714  680 6737 ask them to sell you a 68/69 bus
&gt; bellhousing. Then get yourself a 12 volt to 6 volt bushing to be able to use
&gt; a 6 volt starter. You can then buy a cheap engine stand (Harbour Freight)
&gt; and bolt the bellhousing to it. Easy cheap way to do it.

&gt; I have an order in for an engine starting kit with RMMW, and they have put
&gt; me
&gt; off once again. I've been waiting for two months. What I need is somewhere
&gt; to
&gt; buy a kit  to start my engines without installing them in a car. It's RMMW
&gt; part no. VL16-001, two pages from the end of their catalog. I have some
&gt; 12-volt and some 6-volt engines that I need to use this part on, especially
&gt; the three 6-volt engines sitting out front in my shop.
