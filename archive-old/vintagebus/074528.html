&gt; I think a giant heavy duty pulling tool with arms that grip and pull the

Hi Chris,
You can try the loosened axle nut trick, but we had one drive over 500 miles 
without loosening.  If that turns out the same for you or the bus is not 
drivable as it is now you really need to flip through your phone book for 
&quot;Rental Service, Stores, &amp; Yards&quot;.  Unless you live in the middle of nowhere 
one of these shops should be around.  They rent out earth moving equipment, 
yard maintenance equipment and even tools!  Make sure to get a puller that 
will reach around to the inner lip of the drum or if you have to get one that 
bolts to the drum make sure it bolts to all five lugs and not three!  BTDT 
and stripped the third bolt hole out in an otherwise perfectly good drum.   
Grrrrrrrr!
