Subject: RE: [VB] Alternative &quot;VW&quot; nose badge 

 I love that show too but I see your point. Most of the WCC decals I see are next to a soccer ball decal on a Suburban! Though I'm not sure what a &quot;real&quot; biker is, unless you are refering to a 1%'er. Harley Davidson should shoulder some of the blame, look at the starting price for a hog these days, and I don't mean a sportster. I miss my *gasp* Honda CB750SS and am pondering a chopper build up after I get certified (welding) but I might do it with a BSA or a Triumph instead of a Harley. Maybe I'll just get a Dream and blow off ALL of the hype! Then there's that VW bike on the Samba!
