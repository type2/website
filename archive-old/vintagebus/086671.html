Subject: Re: [VB] crankcase filling with gas

Take the top off the carb with the line still attached. See if the fuel  
comes out when the pin is pushed up. Make sure the float is floating high enough  
to push the pin up. Take it out and see if it has fuel in it. Make sure 
nothing  is holding the float down.
