Hey Brian,

... being a fellow old Westy, stock tranny, bias ply tire, single port
lovin'-kinda bus driver like yourself...I thought I would throw an idea
in the proverbial bucket...

-How about Too high of Compression Ratio?
 -What was your deck height?
 -Did you have your heads fly cut when rebuilt (that will raise Comp)
 -Are you running at least 92 Octane

Being a single port freak and building quite a few of them..I have
noticed that the single port 1500-1600's have a tad higher comp ratio
then the earlier motors. Also with the advent of lower octane gases the
dual port heads were modified and the comp ratio lowered on those
engines too.  Those 1500-1600 singles run the higest comp ratio of the
stock motors.  As you know the higher the comp ratio combined with poor
octane gas = more heat in the heads.._dot_detonation...ect..

The 'master' Gene Berg has some great tech articles on this subject.  I
would print them for folks...but the things are 'highly' copyrighted.
Berg has a semi-hemi cutting tool which reduces the Comp ratio in your
heads.  Thus you can run on the lower octanes available now-adays.
According to Berg the Mexican and Brazilian built beetles run at about a
6-1 comp ratio because of todays low octane fuels.  Where as most single
ports are up around 7.5-1 stock and ran on Hi-octane leaded fuels.
According to Berg those SP ratios are far too hi for todays low octane
fuels in a air cooled motor.

I have lowered the comp on my most recent rebuilds and had spectacular
results.  Check out Bergs Tech articles on the subject...I think you
have to order them from his shop...they are great reading.

This is just an idea and problem I have seen before...may help may
not...after all this typing we will probably find out it is just an old
wig stuck in your fan and the motor runs fine ! HA HA!!!

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;
&gt; Long time no hear, eh?  Well let me tell you what's been goin on over here
&gt; in St. Louie...
&gt;
&gt; I've spent all of last week building up a 1600sp motor for my Westy (64
&gt; hatch-top) from the engine it originally came with when I bought it about a
&gt; year ago.  Up till this point, I'd been running an 'over the counter'
&gt; rebuilt 1600dp.  There was noting wrong with that motor, I just don't like
&gt; Dual-Ports..  ;-)
&gt;
&gt; So, I spent all week scrubbing, sanding and painting tin; bought new Dansk
&gt; heat exchangers, installing new seals, adapting an alternator tot he motor,
&gt; getting together all the flaps and thermostat stuff, etc.  At the end of it
&gt; all, I've got the most anally-assembled motor I've ever built.  All tinwork
&gt; complete, even got me the seals that go around the fresh air ducts...
&gt; working thermostat, well, you get the picture.
&gt;
&gt; Her maiden voyage on the new engine was to be a run out to Kansas City for a
&gt; swap meet on Sunday.  Saturday evening I head out west, and right away
&gt; notice something amiss...
&gt;
&gt; My dual-port motor used to run about 450 degrees on the heads, and 220
&gt; degrees on the oil... at least according to the gauges..  remember I had to
&gt; lengthen the wires to the head temp gauge, right?   But my 'new' SP motor I
&gt; was running 260 on the oil, pushin 600 on the heads, and had absolutely NO
&gt; top-end power..  even the slightest of inclines presented a problem and I'm
&gt; only getting about 17mpg.  HOLY TEMPERATURES BATMAN!!!   Man, don't touch my
&gt; dipstick, cause it will KILL you!
&gt;
&gt; So, OK, I AM pushing a 50mph headwind, and I just learned that all my tires
&gt; were about 10lbs low on air...  plus I'm using an 009 dizzy with a
&gt; Compu-Fire.  On the way home, with a 50mph or so tail-wind.. I did a little
&gt; better on the hills, oil temps were 220 degrees (at least where the DP ran)
&gt; but head temps were still sky-high!
&gt;
&gt; Tonight I changed back to the vac-advance dizzy (with Compu-fire) from the
&gt; old DP, check time, tune carb, and go for a test run.   Oil temps ran 180,
&gt; heads read 350... ran smooth...  That was at least, until I got on the
&gt; highway....
&gt;
&gt; Once I got on the highway, it was a challenge just to get up to 55mph, head
&gt; temps skyrocketed up to near 600 degrees, but oil stayed cool..  only during
&gt; the worst of the head temps did the oil get up to 220 deg.  I got off the
&gt; highway, and my temps dropped VERY quickly...  heads went down to about
&gt; 350-400, oil down to 210... and stayed there through much city driving.
&gt;
&gt; I live about 1 mile from the highway, and by the time I got back into the
&gt; driveway, temps were cool..  I could hold the dipstick without worry, and
&gt; the intake manifold was only warm to the touch... very nice...
&gt;
&gt; But what concerns me folks are those ultra-high readings on the highway, and
&gt; my lack of top-end power...   the motor has good compression, is very peppy
&gt; on the git-go, runs very cool on city streets... what should my temps be
&gt; reading to begin with?  I know I should have more top-end...  when I drove
&gt; the bus home after I bought it, the motor pushed it along at 65 without
&gt; complaint....
&gt;
&gt; BTW, it has an internal 8mm oil cooler (no doghouse here buddy!),
&gt; later-model fan w/alternator, stock crank pulley.  I time it statically at 5
&gt; BTDC with the vac-advance dizzy.  The plugs look great, and the carb tunes
&gt; out perfectly..  it idles and starts beautifully.
&gt;
&gt; So what does the collective think?  Timing?  Advance curve issue?  Stealth
&gt; intake leak? (I've checked already as best I could),  Could my thermostat be
&gt; adjusted wrong?
&gt;
&gt; I need to know quick because I'm supposed to leave Tuesday morning on an
&gt; 1,800 mile road trip to my mom's house in Alabama, Dave Easterwoods in
&gt; Georgia, and finally end up at the Type 2 camp-out in North Carolina.  I
&gt; need help before I arrive at Dave's with melted heads!  LOL..
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for ANY ideas...
&gt;
&gt; -Brian
