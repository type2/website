&lt;&lt; Tonight driving back from the office, I noticed at a red light that the
 brake pedal wouldn't go down no matter how hard I stepped on it. Soon after
 that I smelled something cooking, my driver's side front brake I suspect. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Do not suspect.  If this happens feel each rim near the drum or if you are 
not running hub caps then touch the drums directly with your hand.  Carefully 
it might be really hot!  If only one rim/drum is hotter than the other then 
most likely a plugged flexable brake line.  If a pair or all four then not 
enough play between the brake push rod and the master cylinder pistion.
