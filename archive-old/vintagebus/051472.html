Hi Volks,
The screw holes in our set of original safaris frames are 72mm center to 
center, and 10mm centers in from ends.  Each countersunk hole being 7mm in 
diameter.  Measured by former USAF trained level 5 machinist.  
  Yes we would only use safaris with the original nut plate strip.  The strip 
offers much studier mounting, and some rearranging movement with slightly 
larger holes drilled in the body and if not welded to the body until the 
window is seated properly.
  We would really like to know if these new safaris are perfect enough to 
just be able to buy the bottom sections to repair original safaris with 
rusted out lower sections.
