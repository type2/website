Subject: steering wheel question

Thanks to the list for all the help on removing my steering wheel. I was
able to remove it using a bearing breaker tool and steering wheel puller. I was
planing on having my steering wheel restored but a buddy 
of mine has a flat 4 repro gt steering wheel that i can have, on the condition i
put it in my 63 Crew cab. The steering wheel comes with a 63 bug steering wheel
boss. I would like to use this steering wheel as it is free and new. Is it
possible? I checked the Archive and could only find reference to using a Gt.
steering wheel from a mustang? Any one have any info
