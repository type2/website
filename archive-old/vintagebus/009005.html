Das Bulli Haus seems to have fallen on hard times. In my last conversations
 with them, their hours are now down to part time and they are working a full 
time job to pay the bills. 

My last order was a little slow arriving, but as usual, well packed with no 
shipping damage.

I feel that you get true value for your cash with them.

&gt; http://dasbulli.necaweb_dot_com/    they have the phone number listed on their
&gt; page. I've been trying to get a hold of them for weeks to no avail. I've
&gt; left a message and sent e-mail with no reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck,
&gt;
