dang, I wish I lived in AZ.  Do buses just GROW out there?  I'm just jealous. 
 Don't mind me.  


Yes they do, we find the ones that are dead and resurrect them.  Doesn't everyone have 8 buses in their back yard?

Richard
61 ragtop standard -- the world famous rustybus
63 23 window
54 standard
66 deluxe -- for sale after some work
70 camper -- traded for a blown Pontiac (don't ask.. long story) -- half sold
62 original paint double cab
69 Deluxe (my first bus) -- slightly charred
57 Panel -- Sold but not paid for

The rest are bus fillets... slices of buses that were no longer salvagable (for me that means that when you lift up the floor mat you see the ground and no cross members etc.
