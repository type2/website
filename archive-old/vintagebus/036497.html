&lt;&lt; If you prefer the split, then buy one!
 
 I bought my bus to drive, so a '71 was ideal.  IF I was more interested in
 restoration for shows I would get a split.  Go with what you like!

Hey I hear yah there George, that's why I got me a 64. It seems to me that 
the earlier buses do just as good as driving as any other vehicle in the 
world. And you look better driving a split.
