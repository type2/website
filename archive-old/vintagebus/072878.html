Subject: throw out bearing

Well suddenly my 66 is having a bit of problem w/ the clutch. With the
engine off the pedal moves w/ no noticable binding or any sticking,
returns properly. With the engine running however it's a different
story. There is a slight vibration that transfer through the pedal.
Since I have yet to replace the clutch cable I took a gamble w/ that &amp;
replaced it. Same problem. On take off the bus acts like it's not
engaging the clutch correctly.

I suspect one of the darn TO bearing clips has come off. This happened
once before with a different tranny. Like everyone else I don't wanna
pull this engine again (who does) but suspect I'll be doing just that
tonite. What suggestions does anyone have for keeping those clips in
place or the TO bearing in place if the clips fail?
