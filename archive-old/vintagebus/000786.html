&gt;Hi:
&gt;     Does anybody know what does a bekowa roof rack look like?  Is it german 
&gt;accessory just like westy rack?  I've heard this before but I've never seen 
&gt;one.  Thanks.

I have a full length BEKOWA metal rack.  It looks like a standard industrial 
bus metal roof rack, but the tubing is a little thinner, the rack is about a 
foot longer then my other full length rack and there are 4 legs per side 
rather then three legs per side.  Oh yea,  the clamps are a little different 
too.
