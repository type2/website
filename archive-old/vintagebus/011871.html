&gt;&gt;I've found another thing that keeps me from smelling like I use Old
&gt;&gt;Exxon after shave. They're some funky little clamps that I bought at a
&gt;&gt;swap meet... I don't know what they were for, maybe lab equipment, but
&gt;&gt;they looked too useful to pass up. 

&gt;&gt;They are about 1&quot; square with a rod threaded perpendicular through one
&gt;&gt;side. The rod has a knurled knob and advances a bar that runs parallel
&gt;&gt;to the side with the threaded hole. The opposite side acts as a gate,
&gt;&gt;pivoting on a screw at one end and slipping under another screw to
&gt;&gt;complete the square.

&gt;&gt;These things are great! You can open the gate, put the clamp around the
&gt;&gt;fuel line, close the gate, and screw the bar down to clamp off the line.
&gt;&gt;You then pull the fuel line off and leisurely find your golf tees, or
&gt;&gt;work with the clamp on. They don't destroy the fuel line like clamping
&gt;&gt;with mini-vice grips can, and it's easy to apply a little more pressure
&gt;&gt;to the clamp if you're still dripping.

&gt;&gt;Maybe someone on the list knows what they're really for and where you
&gt;&gt;can buy them (besides chance at the swap meet).

They are indeed lab equipment, but I don't know whether or not they're
still used.  I've got one that I inherited from my father, who used to
bring home old lab equipment from the university where he taught.  As Paul
says, they work well on VW fuel lines.

Perhaps you could buy them at a chemistry supply store --- most universities
have one that sells internally to the staff.  You might not be able to walk in
and pay cash, though, some schools require that you have a P.O. or a research
contract to charge things to.

I've had good success using 6&quot; Vise Grip _needle nose_ pliers, not the regular
ones.  Unless the fuel line is hard and cracked, careful adjustment should allow
you to stop the flow of gas w/o destroying the hose.  Of course, if it is hard
and cracked, it's best to replace the line anyway.

Small pin punches and prick punches with tapered shafts also work well for 
plugging fuel lines.  So does Snap On's smallest size lady foot prybar (about
6&quot; long).

One trick that I picked up many years ago is to wrap a shop towel or rag around
my wrist before reaching to disconnect the fuel line from underneath the car.
Unless you're slow in plugging the line with a punch or golf tee or whatever,
the rag will absorb most or all of the gasoline that otherwise wants to run down
the length of your arm, soaking your shirt, irritating the skin in your armpit,
etc.
