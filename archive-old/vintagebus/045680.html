&lt;&lt;  I don't remember which manual I read regarding their installation, but it 
didn't mention anything about lubrication with the boots. How does this area 
get lubricated, is it from somewhere else? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
All parts of the tranny out to the reduction boxes uses the same oil.  The 
tranny center section oil acts as a reserve in case of sudden axle leakage by 
allowing by design about half of the center section oil run downhill if 
needed.  If one does not notice that much oil leakage, and runs a reduction 
box dry, they need to give thier bus away, and stay home.  Definitely refill 
the tranny after changing boots.  Just make sure to only use the same make, 
and wieght of oil already in there.  Or if you do not know when the oil was 
changed last, or do not remember which oil, change it!   Eric&amp;Barb
