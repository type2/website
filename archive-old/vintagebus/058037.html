Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Ditto for me..

Growing up in East Texas.....I know exactly where you are coming from Rex.  But it's not all that bad.

Hell....I am less stressed driving in the bus around here  than I am in my wife's van---actually keeping up with these maniacs!

&gt; Aw, heck, I drive my stock '71 bus in the SoCal environment all the time.
&gt; Stay in the right lane, speed around 58-62 and never have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Lots of vehicles do the same thing, including most of the trucks.
&gt; Remember that the truck speed limit in California is 55 still, so most of
&gt; them run 60-62 if they want to avoid conversations with John Law, so buses
&gt; fit right in.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose I could feel peer pressure to go faster, but I enjoy my bus too
&gt; much to shorten the trip!  Just because someone else is driving 90 is no
&gt; reason that I have to as well.
