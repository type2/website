The 10w30 you just put in, is the same thickness at full operating 
temperature as the 30wt. was, only it does not get as thick when it gets colder. Some 
argue that multi weight oils will break down, and go to a regular 10wt., which 
can happen, but not even close if the oil is changed every 3000 miles. You have 
to drive on that oil for a LONG time to break down like that.
yes, I have seen 20/50 break down, after a road trip in the SW when my oil 
temp reached 230F according to the sender at the pressure release plug.  Changed 
the oil a little early (about 2K miles instead of 3K), and it had thick glop 
and thinner parts.     Scary!!!!!!  Thus I tend to prefer single weight oils, 
but straight thinner weight wasn't available when I went to the store and I 
needed it right away as I didn't have much spare time and needed my bus to take 
me regularly and on time from point a to point b, over c which is mostly paved.

I find that 20/50 is thicker than 30wt at winter temps in W Wa (lows ~30-40, 
highs ~45-50F), according to my pressure guage.  oh, ya at summer temps too.  
and 40wt is thicker than 20/50.   just what my guage says.
