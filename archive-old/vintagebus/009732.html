Heya List

So I got the engine, gas tank, and transasxle out with almost no problems,
but I did have a stuggle getting that coupler thingy apart,  it looks like I
have to do some brake shoe replacement and shocks.  I'm interested in what
others do for rear break drums for pre 63 buses. I've had my turned and they
look fine but I recall reading somewhere that getting brake drums turned as
not a good idea ..... I've also heard that it is possible to get drums
relined but I've also heard that it is illegal to reline drums.  What is the
story?

Also, I'm sure my shocks are the originals.  My bus only has 40K on the
speedo and I'm sure that is all the miles that the body has on it - ye ol'
bastard engine.  Does anyone have any recommendations as to what kind of
shocks I should go with?  I figure since I've got the transaxle out I should
replace the affordably replaceable.

Well, TIA again mighty list
