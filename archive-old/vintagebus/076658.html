&gt; The best vac dizzy as far as I'm concerned is the SVDA. You can run a
&gt; balance line between your dual carbs at the top of each manifold if
&gt; there isn't a vac line on the carb. I've run Dual 34 PICT 3 CB
&gt; Performance setup, Dual Baby Dells, and Kadrons with success and good
&gt; response and mileage.
&gt;

You're not connecting manifold vacuum to your distributor are you? If so,
it's connected wrong. The only time a balance tube should be used is when
you have dual single barrel carbs, which should not be connected to the
distributor.

You want your vacuum port to be exposed only when the throttle is cracked
open, which can only be done by tapping into the carb.
