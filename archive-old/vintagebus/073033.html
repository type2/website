Subject: gland nut questions/airs help

Well Dan and keith have gotten the engine out, with a little bit of my help.
It is up on the table, oil all over the clutch...we removed this. I guess he
used this super sized gland nut...to replace his original gland nut. This
thing is huge.

We need to get that off-as we believe the front engine seal is what is
leaking, and put a new engine seal in, then a new gland nut-I don't see any
reason to use this oversized one unless you were using it in a racing
capacity.
