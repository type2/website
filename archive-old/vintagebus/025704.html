Subject: 12v conversion
Message-ID: &lt;378CA96A.23D2_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

Picked up my 'camper today (yay) and it is in surprisingly better
condition than I anticipated.
It is a 6v though and I am going to convert it to 12v.
What bits can I pull off of my '67 to use?
I guess starter motor &amp; generator, battery, &amp; globes obviously.
but what about indicator flasher relay &amp; wiper motor?
Will I need to change the ignition switch, coil, plugs, dizzy to handle
the increase in voltage or are these still O.K. to run on 6 &amp; 12v?
Is there a section on conversions in the complete idiots guide or
similar book?
Many thanks,  Daniel
