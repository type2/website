You need to find out where the play is.  Simply &quot;cranking down the box&quot; is not going
to do you any good - and in fact would do harm - if that is not the problem.

You need to have one person climb under the bus, while the other one slowly
wiggles the wheel.  The person underneath looks at all the components that are moving, and 
will be able to pinpoint where the slop is.  It could be the steering box, drag link, 
tie rods, center pivot bushing...

&gt; I was talking to some bug fok, they claim there is an adjusting bolt on the 
&gt; box. ?? They claim I should crank down on it if I'm having a problem with 
&gt; the box.  Does this make any sence to anybody
