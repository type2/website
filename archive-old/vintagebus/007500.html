Some marine fuel and water tanks are made of plastic, and the construction
is by &quot;welding&quot; of the material.  This allows tanks of unusual
shape/dimensions to be fabricated from a collection of stock bits and
pieces, joined with cut to fit sheet material.

A check of ads in any marine-oriented magazine [National Fisherman would be
a good place to start] should turn up plenty of vendors/fabricators.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Oddly enough, a fair number of production vehicles have plastic tanks.
