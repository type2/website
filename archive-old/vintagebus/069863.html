&gt; &gt; well, shoot - if we've stopped debating if the scoops work and gone
&gt; &gt; on to engineering, just hook up one o' them misters you see at
&gt; &gt; outdoor restauraunts and mist your motor  :)
&gt;
&gt; BTDT didn't do much, even if was done to a Vanagon.
&gt; Mister in the intake scoop, thermometer near the
&gt; engine to measure air temp. Total reduction in
&gt; temp was about 5 degrees F. Not worth it.

It would depend upon the volume of water used.  A better place for the
mist nozzle is right at the fan inlet, not in the scoops.

I remember that there are some RV cooling systems that
spray water on the radiator, to prevent overheating on hills.  Works
great, as long as you have a lot of water to spray.  Since water is low
cost and they can carry a lot of it the idea works out.

&gt; However, cooling properties aside, back when I was stupid
&gt; and didn't know better, I made some scoops for my bus.
&gt; I was doing a bunch of kayaking at the time, and I made
&gt; the scoops about 4 inches out from the bus from sturdy
&gt; aluminum. They were strong enough and wide enough that I
&gt; could step inside the scoop and then stand on top to
&gt; secure the kayaks.

&gt; Scoop &amp; step, that's the functional version.

I'd say, that if you want a functional scoop, it has to extend at least 4&quot;
from the side of the bus, to get outside of the turbulent flow layer.  The
best design would probably look like a set of Mickey Mouse ears sticking a
foot out into the airflow.
