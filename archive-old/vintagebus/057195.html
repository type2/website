Check out some local RV shops. Alot of those parts are still available. I've 
seen those types of windows on many a pull-behind camper. Just tons of 
different sizes. But the regulators (cranks) should be much the same.

&gt; 
&gt; 1. Should I fix all the operators of this set of windows? Or should I 
&gt; trade them or buy a set of functional jalosy louvered type windows to use 
&gt; in their place? Are the windows that I have rare? 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Does anyone know where I can get the hardware to fix these windows? I way to share and print your photos:
