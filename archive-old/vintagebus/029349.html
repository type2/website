Subject: 64 SC Turning Radus 3

Found out that the drag link is definitely bent, no signs of body damage
what so ever, original undercoating still in place and
not cracked or redone. Either someone put on a bent drag link, or it
suffered a precise hit from a road object, doubt that
though?

Also found out that the steering box had no fluid and a hole in it, I
thought I checked it and filled it when I got it. So I opened the bottom
so I could flush out the gummy grease that was in there, ran some fluid
through it, closed the bottom back up and
started
filling it, after about 5 pumps the pressure became great enough that it
pushed dirt through a hole in the steering box which
emptied
it of it's fluid. I have temporally plug the hole with a JB weld type
stuff, I hope it holds on the metal of the steering box, I
guess
I get to buy a rebuilt one soon.

Thanks for everyones help in figuring it out, again this list is
AWESOME!

Meredith
