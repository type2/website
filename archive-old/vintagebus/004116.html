I recently received a sample from Ronnie of the TMI mesh platinum interioirs
for 66 and 67 deluxe. They look good and I will be buying seat covers as
soon as monies become available. I would imagine that the mesh gray for the
65 to 67 standards would be as good if not better. Dont think anyone is
doing the silver mesh for the sea blue deluxe or the aero papyrus (spelling?
for the whilte/white deluxe.
