I have a &quot;65 Kombi walkthru.
I bought a middle seat from I would guess a '68-'71. The armrest bar is only
supported in the back and the ashtray is plastic. Also, there is/are no grab
bars on top. Could it be from a later loaf?
The hold-downs do not line up, so I thought I would have to do some welding
to the seat (and ONLY the seat) to make it fit. However, I have seen one nice
baywindow with all the seats in place and it was sweet. So, now I don't want
to mess up the seat, because somebody probably could use it for the correct 
year.
Does anybody know what seat would fit my '65 walkthru?
I've pretty much given up on finding a correct one.
BTW: the seat I have is in good condition and I paid $80.
