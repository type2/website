&lt;&lt; I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of 
bay-window
 pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I 
allow 
 the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail 
from 
 my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I don't
 support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for 
bay-windows - 
 does one exist?

If you doo doo it. Then make it a whole different site. Dont mix old stuff 
with new stuff, it just aint right.
