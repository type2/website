Subject: water rot repair

Oops, I accidentally deleted the e-mail for the person who has the water rot
around the oil screen area in the bottom of his case. Anyway, I called North
West Connecting Rod in Seattle and talked to Dave, Jerry was out. Dave
inspects the cases for welding and/or repair. From what he says, the older
cases are really impure and age makes it really difficult to weld. On the
other hand, if the case is that old, I believe he said 52, and is still std
std, then it might be worth preserving.

To make a short story long, you might want to get with Jerry Monday at
206-763-2487 PST and talk it over with him about the possibility of shipping
the case there and having it inspected. Lots of other people from around the
country have sent their blocks to him.
