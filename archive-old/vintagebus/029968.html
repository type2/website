Subject: Re: [VB] What a Load, how much have you carried ?

I picked up a load of EDM fluid (machine shop karosene) in my 61 crew
cab.  It was 4  55 gallon barrels (475lbs each).  All this in my
lowered, IRS &amp; ball-joint converted crew cab.  Scared the hell out of me
when I saw how much the barrels actually weighed!

&gt; I was doubting the power of the 1600 dp
&gt; that is in my 65 double cab , until
&gt; I saw the previous owner about a month ago and he said
&gt; in discussion that he had the double cab loaded with
&gt; nearly one ton in the back of the pick up
&gt; he described it as 25 bags of quickcrete
&gt; and a load of gravel on the back side of it .
&gt; 
&gt; he claims that it was roughly 1800 lbs. of weight
&gt; can this possibly be trude he also stated that it was not a problem when
&gt; he had to stop at the red light at the  bottom of the steep hill in town
&gt; claim is that it just went right up the hill   ?   imagine that ?
