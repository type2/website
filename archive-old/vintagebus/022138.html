&gt;Can ANYONE shed some light on NEATO/LIMBO.....
&gt;I have sent my money and my application over a month ago,and have not heard

Jim,

The NEATO editing duties changed hands and I took over in late December 
1998.  Starting with the issue mailed in January 1999 the NEATO contact 
mailing address, email address and phone # listed in Old Bus Review was 
changed to mine.  Never the less, there are still people who are sending 
memberships, OBR material, etc to the address in NM (which I can understand, 
because that was the club address for over 6 years).

In late August Tom B. moved from Albuquerque, NM to Philadelphia, PA.  So 
the Albuquerque P.O. Box has been closed and the old phone # is no longer 
in service.  So everyone *PLEASE* stop sending NEATO related info to NM!

When Tom moved he sent a handful of NEATO applications that he had forgotten 
to send to be added to the membership mailing database to George Bossarte 
and George just recently forwarded those to me.  So if any of you know Jason 
Bland, Arthur Dahl, Mark Andstrom, David Dirwachter, Mark Eyestone, Tony 
Lepore, Bob Sowersby, Peter Lubianetsky, Paul Harrison, Lance Moeller, Ken 
Crampton, Joe &amp; Sue Snow, Darla &amp; Craig Brown, or Brad Urmston, let them 
know their newsletters are on the way.  Some of these applications date back 
to March of 1999, and most of them are renewals.  I will be sending them all 
the issues they have missed and will start their memberships with the issue 
that goes in the mail today.

Tom sent me another handful of applications last week he found when 
unpacking after his move and yours may be in that batch.

For future reference, all NEATO Old Bus Review Related correspondence 
should go to me at:

NEATO/Old Bus Review
335 Atlanta Street
Marietta, GA  30060
(770) 514-9159 (eves &amp; weekends)
(770) 528-7419 (weekdays)
neato_at_mindspring_dot_com

All NEATO membership inquiries should go to:

NEATO/Membership Coordinator
c/o George Bossarte
353 Broadway
Cambridge, MA  02139
(617) 876-3090
gbeng_at_world.std_dot_com

I picked up OBR #68 from the printer Wednesday after work and stuffed 
envelopes Wednesday night and last night and they will go in the mail 
today at lunch.  This issue was delayed a couple of weeks due to the 
NEATO/LiMBO Transporter Tourist &amp; Traveller Directory which is being 
mailed with OBR.

If any of you sent membership related info to NM this year and are having 
problems, I would be happy to help you resolve those issues.

Thanks,

Dave Easterwood
Editor, NEATO's Old Bus Review
