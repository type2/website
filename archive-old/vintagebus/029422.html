Hey all...
I got that 40hp engine installed yesterday before school.  Woke up at
5:30 to stick it in and do some other things...
Today...I went out and finished up by hooking up the gas line and some
electrical...and reinstalling the rear apron and bumper.  I ran it for a
little bit and it runs pretty derned nice!  I watched a mouse nest shoot
out of the exhaust though...that was kind of fun :)  No mice
though...good thing.  The muffler had been sitting for quite some
time...so that was to be expected...
Now, all that I have to do is figure out some way to mount and clearance
my air cleaner.  I had to put in a carb riser so that the carb would
clear the generator...but now my air cleaner won't fit between the carb
and top of the engine compartment...I think I'm going to end up
machining my own carb riser that is just a little bit shorter.  I've
done it before...so this time should be a breeze.

I would have done this last night...but I came home at about 4:00...ate
some food... got really dizzy and a bad headache...and went to sleep.  I
slept from 5:00pm till 6:30 am!!  Jeeeez...I couldn't believe it...i
just passed out.

I also picked up some buffing compound the other day...along with some
Menguirs (spelling?) wax...the good schtuff.  I did a little bit on the
rear corners today...where the water runs down and stains the
paint...and by where the splash pans go...all stained and icky paint.
It buffed it all out beautifully!!!  The wax makes it shine soooo
nice... I can't wait to do the whole bus! (read tired arms)

ahh well...thats all for now
