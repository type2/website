From a techincal perspective, it looks like that would work.  I'm not
sure of the ins-and-outs of how one would actually carry out the installation,
but it looks interesting.

I solved the problem by going to 12v all aound (heresey!)

&gt; You can run 2 6 volt batteries in series to give the 12 volt generator a
&gt; 12 volt charging load... then run the rest of your car off of one of the 6
&gt; volt batteries.
&gt; 
&gt; This gives you both 6 and 12 volt options for any accessory you want to run...
