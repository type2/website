Subject: More on Rusty's breakdown
To: Bus List &lt;vintagebus_at_TYPE2.COM&gt;

Rusty Willey from Telluride whom I picked up yesterday
after his engine started knocking (more like a click
really) couldn't have broken down at a better time. 
After a couple hours at my house NEATO President Ed
O'Donnell, Cletus &quot;Splitzine&quot; Riedel, and Micah
&quot;Volkswagen Expert&quot; Hallock picked him up for a night
in the Albuquerque bar scene.  Drowning his sorrows, I
suppose.

This morning Ed and I discovered his problem (a broken
valve spring keeper on #3 intake), and they're pulling
the engine now, hangovers and all.

Another quick repair in the Land of Enchantment.
