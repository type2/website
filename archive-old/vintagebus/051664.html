Subject: Re: [VB] '65 Wiper switch wiring help

yes, this is because there is a lack of wiring diagrams for 65.   the 65 one 
year only wiper motor is har dto find the non existant (AFAIK) wiring diagram 
for.  because it is not like 64, nor like 66.  

If you don't get an answer, Ill go check in my 65 for you.

but think of it this way.  power goes to wiper motor.   .  one out to the 
motor is always on, this goes to the parking circuit - so when you turn off 
the motor, it keeps going till it parks the wipers not right in front of your 
face.  That probably is the one with the two prongs.  or like you say the 
power to the interior light- that sounds right. The hot wire is ususlly 
black, i think wiper hot may be black/purple.  black means hot with power on 
(circuit 15)  but once it goes into the wiper circuit I think it gets another 
number.   same colour as in the colour wiring diagram for other years- 
mostly.  
so another outlet goes on when you pull the knob- to turn the wipers on.   
wiper motor grounds directly to body of bus, not through wiper switch.

you can test the switch with some wires, clips, a battery, and a test light, 
see which terminal does which.  make a map.

clean the wires a bit with nasty solvent to get the paint off.  carb or brake 
cleaner often works.

 Okay my next quandary is this.  I removed the wiper switch in my '65 single
 cab assuming that the terminals on the switch were marked appropriately and
 reinstallation per the diagram would be easy.  Well I need to reinstall the
 switch and can't figure out which wires go where because the switch isn't
 marked.  It has the little embossed circles but no numbers.  Now recently I
 bought another '65 wiper switch on ebarf because it was cheap.  This new
 switch has the same 4 embossed circles but with numbers which are (clockwise
 from the top right as you look at the back of the switch) 31, 31b, 54, 54d.
 31 is a ground through the housing so there is no spade connector on this
 particular location.  One of the terminals, #54, is double prong.
 
 There are 4 wires that went to the switch, one of which is actually 2 wires
 in the same female connector which I assume to be the power from the fuse
 box and lead to the interior light.  At this point I don't know the exact
 colors of the wires that were connected as they were painted white when the
 interior was painted by the PO.  The Bentley diagram only shows 3 wires, 2
 of which are connected to the same terminal, but no terminal numbers.  Any
 ideas which wires go where?  Confused?  So am I:(
 
 Thanks,
