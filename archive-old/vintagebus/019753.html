Hey speaking of this, is there supposed to be some type of band clamp around the dampner and bracket on these.  On all the mufflers I've ever installed I've never thought this looked right.  The dampner never fits in the concave portion of the bracket.  Have I been installing these wrong?

I believe these were used on 40hps, not on a 66.  you should have the dampner 
pipe, the tailpipe, and a bracket that bolts to the left side of the muffler 
and clamps to the tailpipe and has a flange bolting to the dampner.   
there's a picture at
