Subject: Re: [VB] Finding GL4

&gt;My advice is to find the wholesale oil supplier first and ask them to tell
&gt;you what retailers or Oil change shops have GL4 fluid because most don't.
&gt;You will waste a lot of time looking from FLAPS to FLAPS and each one will
&gt;give you the same misinformed lecture that GL5, GL4-5-6 or even GL6 are
&gt;better and you should just use those. Don't listen to them. Get straight
&gt;GL4.


I have been looking at gear oil bottles every time I visit a store w/ an
auto section lately.  K-Mart, Wal-Mart, etc.  All those had only GL5.  I
went to Mobil's site and found in the specs for Mobil 1 gear lube that it
is OK for GL4 rear axel service, but it in specifically NOT recommended for
gearboxes where a  &quot;GL4 performance standard&quot; is required.  Too bad, as I
have been using Mobil 1 motor oil for years with good results (181,000
miles on my Toyota truck, purchased new, w/ no repairs to the lubricated
engine parts).

Anyway, I was at a Checker auto parts store yesterday and I say Valvoline
gear oil, so I checked it out.  The bottle claims that their oil is rated
for BOTH GL4 AND GL5 service.  Is this possible?  The stuff is redily
available, and from a reputable refiner.  Any comments anyone?
