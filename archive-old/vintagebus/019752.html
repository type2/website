Ellis has a coworker who had guests in town for last
weekend's Phx BugoRamage. Being totally engulfed in
being a new daddy combined with taking several
computer classes and not focused on the VW show
schedules I errantly thought that Kelly Park was the
same weekend as was Phx BOR. This had occurred some
years past. The Mortensen family have changed the date
of BOR for that reason over the past few years. &quot;My
bad&quot; as the kids say...

Prior to understanding that KP isn't until April 22nd,
I told my coworker that anyone who missed Kelly Park
and the Red Barn shows to come to Phx BOR was a total
moron. Turns out that on two points **I** was the
moron. =)

1.&gt; KP was not the same weekend 
2.&gt; The coworker's friend is Richard Stuart, the
promoter of the Red Barn show. April 21st DOH!

Make sure to attend both!

I smell a poopy diaper. Time to go!!! ;-)
