Dave Easterwood,,
   Saw your e-bay comment.  Yes I've been known to email overcooked bidders
and tell them where they can find it for less...(-8   We've bought a lot of
&quot;collectible&quot; stuff like models on ebay...._dot_usually lurk until last minute
so as NOT to drive price up.  This works if there are only 1 or 2 bidders
and the high guy assumes he's got it.  Allow yourself time to see if he had
a high max, or better, bid the HIGHEST price you'd comfortably want to pay.
  If there are a bunch of bidders, do a bid history; if the high guy's date
of last bid is days before the others, you can assume he set a high max.  I
also go to SEARCH and do a past buying/bidding history on the other bidders
to see how much they've spent in the past and if they tend to GET what they
bid on.  Also gives you an idea what they are into.  I did buy a vw parts
manual from a guy in New Zealand and paid close to $70 as I recall, but
here I've seen such at shows for that much or more- depends how rare it is.
 I saw but forgot to bid on the 50's Motor trend mag that featured the
splittie busses and went for like $7?
     In searching VW, you get lots of HOTWHEELS crap- you can filter these
out with the (-) symbol in front of what you don't want, like -HW
-hotwheels -bug etc.
---aside- nonVW content:
   A real winner of an ebay story is my wife bid on a Lathe of Heaven
&quot;pirate&quot; tape (a movie on PBS that was never released due to copyright
wars)...she quit at $100, and the buyer got it for $152!  We offered to pay
for a copy of it; in the meantime found a pirater on the web
(trashpalace_dot_com) that had it for $20, turned out to be poor copywork
(skipped, jagged edges of 5th geration copies).....turns out the ebay
buyers were perfection nuts, didn't like the washed out color, sent us the
original to see what was wrong with it, and let us have it!   Obviously
it's a low generation copy with nice edges, just a color prob- what do they
want from something kept since 82??
     Speaking of collectables; don't go for the first time you see an item;
it will come along later being sold by someone else who notices how high
the first sold...ie, the model bus that rides on a record and plays it, or
those bus cookie jars.
