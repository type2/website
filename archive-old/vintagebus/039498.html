&gt;an altenator on the engine instead of a generator. He has a new BOCAR 34
&gt;PICT carb, bus seems to have some interference with the altenator. I  think
&gt;he said it was the linkage or something.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone recognize this problem? What's the solution.

Yep I think clara might mention something here, I think its the same thing 
she had, although a little different. He could add a riser to the carb, but 
the accelerator linkage might get wierd.
How much clearance is needed? Is he using an alternator stand instead of  a 
gen stand? It makes a difference. One longshot thought is to grind away some 
of the alt housing and make it work.
Really with this kind of problem I need to see it. Pics helpful here.
