Subject: 1954 RHD DD Panel
Message-ID: &lt;3B2F2C36_at_dog_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

As several of you on the list already know, I am about to put my 54 RHD DD 
Panel up for sale.  This is due to the recent purchase of another quite 
expensive bus and the need to buy a home (bay area rents are killing me).  
This RHD DD was at Kelly Park and can also be seen in Thom's barndoor panel 
gallery.  I have a word document that gives a detailed description and can 
email it to anyone that might seriously be interested. It will probably be on 
Everett's page in a day or two with more info, pics, price, etc.  Thanks, 
Drew.
