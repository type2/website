What did you do about the rear engine support bar Scott?  I have just fitted
a DTM shroud to my friends type 4 engine and installed it for him
(practising on his bus before mine!) but have yet to make mounts for the
support bar.  Someone worried me and said that the chassis rails where the
bumper mounts are too weak - has yours been fine?
