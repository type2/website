Hey all,
Its my birthday today.. wahoo!
It was also the First Annual Isaiah's Birthday Bus Ice Cream Run
today... 4 buses strong. 2-62's, 1-58, and 1-78 bus were in the
crew...we went to a local drive in ...and got ice cream.. that was
gooooood stuff :)

Anyone know a source for the felt channels for the slider and stationary
door windows??  I know the regular stuff is available everywhere... but
I have the wider channels as I have the latches that don't go through
the glass...and..well... there's a picture of them up on
http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/62.htm  I believe its in the EXTERIOR
section...

Isaiah
