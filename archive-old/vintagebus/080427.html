Subject: VW Microbus: WSJ, Dow Jones Investment-Car Index says time to
  sell

Hi,

My father was all too happy to send me a copy of the WSJ and their 
recommendation to sell the VW Microbus, because the value of the 
Microbus has skyrocketed over the last several years. He's been 
hounding me for the last 20 years to sell my bus.

You usually need a subscription to read the WSJ_dot_com, but I found a site 
that is hosting the story without having to log in:

Dow Jones Investment-Car Index

1964 Volkswagen Transporter deluxe 21-window with sunroof

Typical Price/High Price			Last Five Years	Last 10 Years
$15,200/ $25,000				+185%			+344%

&quot;Sixties nostalgia has pushed prices through the roof. But don't be 
greedy: Drawbacks of so-called &quot;Microbus&quot;--weak engine, poor safety 
rating--worry car fans who say collectibles should be models that were 
outstanding when they hit the market&quot;

My response was: The VW Microbus isn't (or shouldn't be) an investment 
car. So who cares.

Conrad
