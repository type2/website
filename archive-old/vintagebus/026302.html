Subject: [VB] Brake lining thickness
Message-ID: &lt;383835AB.1BAD13EC_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Hi,

Went to install the left side rear brake shoes today and ran into a
problem.  BTW thanks to everyone who had suggested I just drive the bus
till the drum unstuck itself.  The axle seal went and conveniently lubed
it from the inside out.  Slide off like melted butter.

Back to my problem.  When I went to install the drum, it would not slide
over the shoes.  They are about 1/8 inch to thick.  The adjusters are
fully adjusted in and all looks as it should per Bentley.  This is a '67
with a big nut tranny and the 250mm brakes.  The lining depth is 8mm on
the new shoes  (less backing plate).  Is this correct?  The shoes are
made in Canada.  What might I be wrong?  Could they given me bay window
brakes??

Thanks.

Steve
