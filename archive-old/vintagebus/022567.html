Just received a pair of supposedly NOS heat exchanges from the bus depot,
the ones meantioned earlier that are much better than the DAnsk. Shouldn't
VW NOS parts have VW part  numbers somehwere? And comparing them to the
original VW set that came off our '65, the are pretty crude. Just kind of
thought there should be a part number is the were NOS. Kind of
dissapointed.  Jim
