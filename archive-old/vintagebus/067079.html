Subject: Re: [VB] play in the steering

If you've checked out everything else, and determined the play is really in 
the SGBox, do go ahead and adjust it.  Or just adjust it anyway, though like 
you said a too tightened box can have tighten and or crucnhy steering.  If 
the box is really wonky, it could suddenly bind up on you.  But that is why 
you check the steering several times before calling it good. 
     It is very simple to do- jack the bus up so the front wheels are off the 
ground (ebrake on, jack stands under beam- safety awareness on).   Use a 
wrench to loosen the locknut and a screwdrive to turn the screw.  Turn the 
screw in a tad, turn the wheel all the way through its motion.  Turn the 
screw in till it just BARELY drags, then back it out so there is NO drag.   
Tighten down the lock nut.   turn the wheel all the way back and forth a 
couple times to make sure there is no drag.  Voila!    You may also want to 
clean out the box.  Undo the little bolts on the bottom, and drain the oil 
into a drain pan, there isn't much.   Undo the 8mm square headed fill plug 
and take it out.  I sprayed spray lube through and watched the gurk come out. 
   Specs call for gear oil in there, but the on dit is to mix grease and gear 
oil in a 1 to 1 ratio and squeeze it in with a squirt bottle like a ketchup 
squeezer.  But first clean off the bottom plates really clean and glue that 
back on and install the bolts.  I've used the brown permatex goop between 
each layer of shimmmage.  If your horn wire is messed up, it a nice idea to 
replace it before putting the bottom cap back on, or you can feed the new one 
up from below after the plate is on.    When I did this, I filled with 
straight gear oil, and still have a slight drip a few years later, so the 
grease/oil mix probably would have been better.   This may not help much, but 
it won't hurt.   rinsing the gurk out I am sure helps.  Put the fill plug 
back in when the box is full up to that level.
    I live in the soggy PNW, and had water in my SGBox.  I drove around like 
that for about 3 years till I got around to changing the oil, so that is a 
good thing to do.   Saw a bus have the steering freeze solid after a really 
hard frost, owner put a campstove (lit) under the SGBox to thaw it out so he 
could turn the wheel, it was nearly all water when he drained it.  That can't 
have been good for the innards. 
    Here in the US Wolfgang in Redding Ca rebuilds SGBoxes.  Think they 
charge a hefty core charge as they want cores back to rebuild and I have no 
clue what shipping would be to the UK.
    My own rule of thumb (other than those with thumbs rule... and cats don't 
have thumbs) is that if total play in the wheel is less that 3 inches, I 
don't worry.   If the box causes more than that, I'd find a good or rebuildt 
one and replace it.  

It's amazing how many parts there are to one of these buses, and they do work 
better if all the moving parts are clean of grit and greased or oiled as 
appropriate.  I mean, I drive a 37YO bus around everyday, and I have this 
list of things to do to it stuck to the overhead air vent.  I've had the 65 
for years and would feel fine taking a long trip in it today, but there are 
still a bunch of little things to catch up on.  
    Then I realise there is something else to put on the list.

 &gt; The steering box is at the front under the end of 
 &gt; the steering column.  It has an arm off it (pitman arm) that is connected
 to 
 &gt; the front end of the drag link.  The shaft the pitman arm goes to should
 not 
 &gt; go in/out of the Steering gear box (SGB).  Changing the SGB is a PITA, so 
 &gt; hopefully that's not where all the play is.  A bad SGB also clunks when 
the 
 &gt; wheel is wiggled.   
 
 My steering box has about 1mm to 1.5mm play on the shaft that the pitman arm
 goes to.  Is there anything that can be done to this or should I just leave
 it?
 There is only one guy who can refurbishes the steering boxes properly in the
 UK, but he is a retired engineer and only does a few now and again.  The
 Split screen van club is raising money to have the tooling made up for the
 parts to have them repaired properly but until then I can't get a
 refurbished RHD box unfortunately.
 I am aware that over adjusting the box can cause notchy steering and cause
 the box to wear out more, just wondered if a small amount of play could be
 taken out.  My box is very grimy, and doesn't look like it has been adjusted
 for a long time.
 
 Thanks
 Paul
