Thanks VW Insiders   Just looked over a email about a
Mex rubber seal not fitting right.Has me thinking you
folks have other pitfalls we newbies(I am new to list
got my Bus back in 94) should be looking out for.I
have had a fuel pump metal tube pop out of the fuel
pump with gas hose and hose clamp still attached to
it.And this caused a fire.I have since wired the parts
in place and now hear the one on the carb is suspect
to.....Lug nuts are working loose and wheels are
rolling off and causing damage to buses and
others....Single line brake systems should be updated
to dual systems I hear (My 67 came with
dual)....People with briefcases full of cash sending
buses to far away lands...I wonder about parts for
sale on ebay and stolen buses parted out? (Buy only
from upright parts suppliers?)...What else is a
pitfall out there that you know about? Or helpfull
hints? I had very sloppy steering wheel free play and
his was fix by a simple installation of a new drag
link for apx.$20 bucks...A world of differnce..and all
I needed was a pickle fork..$10 bucks...And I thought
the whole front end needed work.A tire shop told me it
would be a 500 dollar job!While I was under there I
saw lots of grease fittings and looked to me like at
least one was missing...there is a opening and nut but
no zerk fitting right in the middle of that front
beam( king pin?) Zerk it? Grease it? Oh...and Hey,
Mark...never armor all the drivers seat then hit the
brakes......just the passenger seats!
