Sorry to every one who has tried to call or email in the last few weeks. 
First, we went on vacation to Maui, highly recommend it. Not many VW buses on 
the road, but every other gift shop had a T shirt with a Deluxe on it.
(How about that for bus content?  :)
When we returned, Arizona was under water, the first substantial rain in 6 
months, that's why this is the desert.
Anyway, with all that rain the phone lines underground created a nice loud 
hum and static. This in turn made Email impossible and conversations 
interesting.
So for all those who left messages that the answering machine was unable to 
pick up, try try again. For those who put up with us yelling in your ear, 
thanks
