&lt;&lt;....  Then another VW enthusiast who fouind the information usefull
compacted the information ( I assume in the exact format and with the proper
source included) for easier download for other VW enthusiast. (who already
have access to this material for free.) How does
this act of kindness constitute &quot;an act of theft&quot;.  Please explain.&gt;&gt;

Yes,please. Do explain! I agree with Steve. Mike is just doing us ALL a
favor by making the info easier to get to so that more of us might benefit
from your insight and advice.. Many of us might not get a chance to read it
if it is lengthy and difficult to download.  But that's just a GIRL'S
opinion!  Thanks Mike, BTW!!! :-)
