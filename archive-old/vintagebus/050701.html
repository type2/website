&gt; You need to get one of the 74-79 bug fuel pump that has a 10 degree tilt at
&gt; the top. That pump was designed for the wide bodied alternator installed on
&gt; late model bugs and I have heard that this pump will work.

You also need a shortened fuel pump rod that is set properly to the right
