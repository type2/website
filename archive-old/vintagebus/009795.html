weel if you look at the price of a new car, the added insurance , the
maintenence etc, and the fact that after 100,000 miles, its a worthless
piece of **** , then any money you spend on your vw that can last forever is
worth it.

so why cant some of the experts here be in charge of commisioning a bunch of
safari kits from some factory somewhere, make sure they are done right , and
we could all go in on an order of 200 pairs or so, and get them cheap???

all this talk about safaris is makin me sweat , if you have ever felt the
humididty in mobile alabama you would pay $1000 for a set of safaris, its
about 80 degrees here right now ,   anyway if anyone out there is putting in
safaris now, im looking for a driver side windshield for my 66

&gt; Ya know, I am gonna incurr such a wrath for saying this, but *nothing* on
a
&gt; bus should cost that much (save for engine, paint or body work).  I've
been
&gt; writing an article on my beef with eBay...how it's artificially inflated
&gt; the prices on the used parts market
