'tis the day before Christmas,
and all the listees
were thinkin' of busses and
fine things they be.

A note from a friend
would be a nice thing to find,
but the slowness of the mail,
hope it comes in time.

Enough attempts at rhyming.

Merry Christmas, happy hannukah,
joyous solstice, fine kawanza,
or none-of-the-above.
However you choose.  

Cherish those around you with
vigor and vim, for bad things
do happen no matter what you do.

We have a lost a fellow listee
recently and I lost a brother and
his wife in October.

Regardless of the way you choose
to celebrate the season, take the
time to tell those around you that
you love them, for sometimes that
is all they need to continue on,
or it may be the last time you get 
to say it.

My your holidays be as happy as possible.
