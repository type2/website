&gt; I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;,
&gt; but here it is.  What is 
&gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? 

I got a ticket for 65 in a 55 a few months ago, but I
knew my speedometer was off: I forgot for just long
enough.  My top speed was 80 trying to stay up w/
Barry Reade when his speedometer went out on that long
downhill just east of Kingman, Arizona with a 1600 SP
and a 3.88.

With my 3.88 in Texas on the way to Ennis, I
accidently hit 75, but the best speed vs. drivetrain
is in my '59 Westy, which I can maintain 70 plus with
a small nut trans!  (However, I suspect a 4.12 final
drive ratio.)  Plus that 1600 SP engine has always
been a really good cruiser.  I hate to go between 45
and 50 in freeway traffic.  In a 75 mph speed limit,
it's dangerous, but some people want to caravan that
slow.
