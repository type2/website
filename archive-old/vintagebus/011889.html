Subject: re;shoddy parts and tire size
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

we all seem to get shoddy parts at one time or another, but sometimes thats all thats avaiable 
so we have no choice, in my store i tell people the part is fair and that they don't have to buy it, i will replace it for free if it goes bad in a reasonably amount of time, i try to sell a lot of german, but alas a lot of them are repackaged brazil or mexico shipped in a box made in germany
got a batch of german axle boots lasted 3-6 months
another german brand 3 years so far, so a good shop will tell you what he has and offer the option of a better quality part but be prepared for a major cost differance.
i try to stock the best parts i can find and charge a percentage over what i pay, a lot of parts people buy the junk and charge the good part price thats where people get burned,
ps, just got in after 3 years erling german engine gasket (1500-1600) sets nice quality
12.95 is what i sell them for going fast trying to
get another 100 of them first 100 almost gone.

i found 195/75-15 8 plys at a couple tire stores
ranged from 56.00-78.00 per tire otd but these tires were marked trailer use only, is a trailer tire better or worse then a vehical tire, seems they would take more abuse because of setting around tag tires dragging, no shocks on a trailer axle so thy must be real true, non of the tire stores i went to could give me an answer, it's funny how people can sell stuff thy no nothing about, especially when your life is on the line.

ps. going to SEMA show in NOV. (largest auto parts
convention in the world) they added tire dealers show so i am going to every tire manufacturer there and am going to find 195/15 6 or 8 ply tires
to sell in my shop so watch for my post second week of nov.
