&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Just bought a rebuilt generator and regulator.  Installed
&gt; everything, polarized it, started the bus and red light.
&gt;
&gt; I had my 5 year old sit in the cab whil I fiddled with the brushes.
&gt;
&gt; The lights seems to go on and off when I push the brushes around.
&gt;
&gt; Is this normal for a rebuilt generator????  Do the brushes need
&gt; to seat themselves for a while?

No.  The light should go out and stay out.  It might be that the new
generator is DOA.  You should check the voltage regulator as well.

My choice would be to put in an internal regulator alternator.
