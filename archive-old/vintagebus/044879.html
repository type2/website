Subject: shift rod woes.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 59' bus with the shifter close to the seat, I'm trying to get the 
front section of the shift rod out so I can pull the front beam. I cant get 
the front coupler off, I soaked the bolts for weeks, heated them and 
eventually broke the heads off and had to drill them out. but I still cant 
get the coupler off. Its to the point where I'm going to cut the rod. But 
first I want to know if the long part of the rod that goes under the cargo 
floors is the same length/diameter as the 67' rod I have. If not, does any 
one have one they want to sell? I would like to just buy the short part that 
connects the shifter to the longer portion of the shift rod if anyone has 
one, keeping in mind its the early 59' type with the shifter close to the 
seat. Or if you know a trick to get them off I would love to hear it. thanks.
