&gt; ................. how'd you like to look forward to all the Mexican music

Ya know, the bass riffs on some of that stuff are pretty cool.  Several
years ago, I lived about 1/2 a block from an apartment complex where
probably 90% of the people would run if the INS van showed up.  On
Saturday nights, the Budweiser flowed like a river, and the boomp-boomp,
boomp-boomp, boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp flowed until the wee hours.
It's tolerable when everything above 5mhz is filtered by distance
and drywall.
