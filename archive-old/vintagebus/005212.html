Rex writ:

 Uphill...more vibrating. Engine is fine
&gt; when in neutral and no vibrating when the bus is rolling in neutral.
&gt; I'm gonna climb under the bus and make sure my engine bolts are
&gt; tight. Any other suggestions before the engine gets pulled? Maybe I'm
&gt; on the totally wrong path or something.

While I can't offer anything specific, I recommend spending plenty of time
trying to diagnose the problem BEFORE you pull the engine.
Nothing is more frustrating than taking it all apart and not being able to
identify the problem
