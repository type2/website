To all the people that have emailed regarding the truck
First off let me make the comment that I assume this is a Binz. I did not
see a binz plate in it. The title does not refer to it as a Binz.  But
everything else about it tells me that it is a Binz though.. i.e. the
shortened gates, the bed side seam along the cab, the non pedestal rear
seat. The only thing that seemed really odd to me was that the rear door
glass is like the front doors glass, in it is split and can be opened half
way by sliding it and rail locking it.

I am no expert on Binz trucks I do not know what is what about them I just
got lucky with this one.

I hope the old cliché  that says a picture is worth a thousand words is
true. I have had emails from over 100 people from every corner of the world
today. I look forward to getting pictures up showing every angle of the
beast in order to answer most of them.

For all of you who wrote asking where exactly in U.T. I found it, I have to
say that until it is safely home I will not disclose this information.

For all the potential buyers out there, I have had some steep numbers thrown
at me today and have not even considered them. If anyone is really
interested in purchasing it fly out here to see it with $$$ in hand.  Hey
you never know I might be persuaded.

If you have information that will be useful to me or would just like to say
right on please continue to email me. If on the other hand you want to
berauge me with questions I can not answer, please wait untill I have the
truck is home and the pictures are posted.

I realize that this is a vary impersonal email and I hope the list will
forgive me for using it in such a manor.

Shawn
