Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Left Rear Brakes (sometimes)

time to look at the rubber hoses in teh back.  Remove the rubber hose on that 
side, can you blow through it?    Or generally,  is it easy to bleed the 
brakes?   should be.   Rubber hoses going bad can let some fluid through, 
then not let it back, which holds the brakes on and they get hot.  When they 
are really bad they burst.

&lt;&lt;      Here is the latest one that has so far evaded correction. My left 
 rear brakes are dragging sometimes. The drum gets hot while the other 
 three stay almost cold. This has been happening for around a month. I 
 have readjusted the brakes, removed the drum around 6 times, replaced 
 the shoes, replaced the brake cyl., replace the spring hardware, added 
 spots of grease to prevent binding. All looks fine when its apart. Then 
 I put it back together and drive it. It still gets hot. &gt;&gt;
