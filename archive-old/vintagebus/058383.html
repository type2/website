Subject: RE: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

Paint can make a great insulator, keeping heat in, instead of letting the
bare metal radiate it to the cooling air. Now if this was a water cooled
block, I wouldn't have any qualms over painting it. The Transaxle is another
entirely different thing, I paint them!

Was writ:
&gt;I'm powdercoating my cases silver. Looks kewl. Overheating comes from too
hot oil. Paint your proper running engine case blue imetalflake if you
like.&lt; 

I would only recommend a &quot;naked&quot; magnesium case or one painted flat black
(what I do - not high temp paint either, just plain Rustoleum).  

In theory this will be the most efficient at dissipating heat.  I use the
word theory because I do not have the equipment to prove it :)  Granted I
will take Bob Hoover's word for it, as he recommends this practice and has a
much better mechanical knowledge base to draw from than most people.

Just because Mark Stephen's has nice posters with colorful engines on it
does not mean they are the cats meow.
