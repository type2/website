Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

I find that the scoops on my '67 make the engine run cooler when running 
into headwinds.  The engine seems to run almost too cool pushing into 
the wind.  I wouldn't put scoops on a bus that didn't already have 
them.  Of course, unless they were of the Martha Stewart flavor!
