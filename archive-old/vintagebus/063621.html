Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

I wouldn't be to quick to condemn a motor with that amount of end play.  spec 
is .003 to .005&quot;.  yours if not far out and could probably be safely 
reshimmed.  I'd take into account other factors- how is the compression, does 
the front main bearing move?  what amount of shimmage does it already have?
