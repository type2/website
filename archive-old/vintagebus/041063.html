Sorry you feel that way. The truck is sitting in my back yard as we speak.
It made it home after about a month of flatbed BS. It hasn't made it into
the shop yet though due to lack of $$$.

As far as sending you a picture of it, I'll pass at this time. So please go
ahead and think of it as a lie if you so desire. There has been more than
one list member in the Seattle / Tacoma area that have seen / sat in it.

Hell two people on the Bay window list wrote messages stating they had seen
it on the freeway. One said I think they saw it outside of Roseburg, OR, and
the other one... I can't remember where.

Anyway make it to the Puyallup spring show next year. That will be the first
time I will drive it to a gathering, and at that point pictures will be
allowed.

Sorry for your inconvience,
Shawn
