Subject: RE: Fw: Re: [VB] Halogen light conversion????


[...]

&gt;They replace a sealed beam headlamp almost perfectly except......They are
&gt;thinner at the section where they sit in the base and the ring rests on &gt;to hold them down. You tighten the hold down screws and they seat the &gt;ring but the H4 light still moves around. The sealed beam cross section &gt;is about 6mm thick. The H4 is about 3mm. I have to stick a large o-ring &gt;between the light and the ring to get it tight. 
------------------

I've used these lamps on a couple of bay buses for several years.  I use the flexible Lexan light protectors - shaped like a shallow bowl - which mount under the retaining rings.  They seem to take up the slack just right, and they do a great job of protecting the lamps.
