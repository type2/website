Subject: Re: [VB] Questions from a Groovy Dude-belts 

Thanks to everyone who was agreeing with me on the seatbelt thing. My
friend Rick loved an argument. He would have loved to see me change just
ONE person's mind on an issue. I would have to have changed HIS mind on
THAT issue.

Another bus-related note. About ten years ago one of our So Cal members of
SV2s was in a full head-on driver's side accident in his bus. He put his
face through the windshield. BUT because he had his seatbelt on, that's all
that happened. Aftermath? He had his nose stitched up and looked ugly for a
month or so. He also had to give up scuba diving since it messed up his
sinuses. So, he sold all of scuba gear and spent it (and the little
insurance money he got) on his new bus. He's perfectly fine these days and
a dad of two little brats.

So...feel free to argue with me on the seatbelt. But, if you value anything
more than yourself (i.e. if you value your friends, family,etc.) install
them and wear them.

I'm done preaching...

Scott
