&gt; This a general question. Are there paint-on or spray on paint that cover and
&gt; bond to surface rust? I saw a spray in Wal-Mart that claimed to turn surface
&gt; rust to a Black primer. Is this for real?? Anyone used this type product?

I recoommend POR15, it works. I've never had any good experiences with the
rust converters. The rust always came back and worse.

I used POR15 all over the bus during the restoration in 95, and there is
no rust anywhere that I used it. Go to www.por15_dot_com and ask for their
catalog. It's free, and the products work, and work as advertized. They
are not cheap, but for ten or so bucks you can get the trail kit, which
contains the whole system, so you can check it out. Get it in black - it's
easier to see and deal with. Follow directions explicitly and you'll get
the results.
