The Cool Breeze VW club based in Cleveland, Tennessee is having their 
falling down drunk weekend at Hanging Dog campground on Hiawassee Lake 
in Murphy, NC.

Friday night is a fish fry ($5 for non-members) and Saturday night is 
a free BBQ.  GREAT food!

&quot;Mopwater&quot; drinking contest!  How long can YOU keep standing?

Organize your own posse and comb the woods for FBI's 10 most wanted 
bombing suspect Paul Rudolph and earn a million dollar bounty for his 
capture!

Sunday there is a VW show in Toccoa, GA which is about an hour southeast 
of Murphy, NC.

Hope to see some of you there at these events this weekend.

Dave
