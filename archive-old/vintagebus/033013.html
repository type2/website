&lt;&lt; thanks for the tip on the thermostatic bellows... i know i do have one, is
 there a way to tell if it is working properly?&gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
You are welcome! 
 Yes, two ways.  One way is to check the thermostat to be shrunk down to 
about half the hieght of the bracket it resides in, when the engine is cold.  
Then drive around for at least fifteen minutes outside temps higher than 50F. 
 With engine still running and shifted in nuetral, hop out and recheck (by 
eye only!) the thermostat to see if it is swolen up to almost the hieght of 
the inside of the bracket.  The other way to check is to remove the 
thermostat and drop it into a tin can of boiling water and see if it expands. 
 This latter test with a thermometer is the best way to really test it for 
operating at proper temp range.  With it out you can toothbrush/soap it clean 
of grit out of it's folds to prevent sand/dirt/small rocks from puncturing 
the bellows!  With the bellows out make sure to test the flaps rod to see if 
it easily moves up and down by hand!  If not the rod may be bent and rubbing 
inside the head fins or more likely someone installed the rod through the 
wrong opening through the head!  Remember to install it through the outer 
(From the engine case.) verticle opening in the head! Or as we remember it 
&quot;The rod goes in the outer.&quot; !
  We recently have figured out that over the years many times the flaps rod 
has been shoved up by DPOs removing/installing the shroud and 
dropping/smashing the entire wieght onto the tip of the flap rod!  This in 
turn bends the curved arm insde the RH flaps that the upper end of this rod 
attaches to.  With the thermostat removed make sure the bottom end of the rod 
easily is pulled downward so the threaded end is just below the top inside 
surface of the thermostatic bellows bracket!  If not, the curved arm inside 
the RH flaps has been bent upwards and this will make the bellows rub itself 
to death againts the upper inside of the retaining bracket!  Which will cause 
the bellows to loose the chemical inside that contracts the bellows when 
cooled.  Due to this failure the bellows in this situation will fail and 
automaticly expand to open the flaps as far as it can expand inside of the 
bellows bracket.

&lt;&gt;
If the parts are really new German or NOS that is a good price, but you 
should easily be able to find all the parts used and buy the cooler new at a 
price well under half of this.   Eric&amp;Barb
