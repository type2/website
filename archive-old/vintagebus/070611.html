Subject: axle tube retainer woes

I just installed my transmission last night and today I'm trying to re-attach
the axle tube retainers. I started with three gaskets and worked down to one
of the thinnest, each time torquing the bolts to spec (14 ft/lbs. as per the
manual, in standard flange series). Each time it seems too tight. The axle
will not drop freely under it's own weight. in fact it won't budge at all,
even when I push on it.

I'm wondering if letting it sit empty for half the year is causing it to
stick. It moves freely without the retainer tightened. There is a thin coating
of oil over the whole inside, but perhaps that's not enough. Does anyone have
any objections to my spraying a little lube around the area to maybe loosen
things up? I was thinking lithium grease or even motor oil. I haven't
purchased any transmission oil yet, so I was just gonna use what's laying
around. Would any of these other lubes be incompatible with the transmission
oil?

Maybe that's not even the problem. Any thoughts?

Appreciating the assistance,
Rocco
