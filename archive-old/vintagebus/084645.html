I too remember when this all happened.  I just showed my family the article
and even they remembered.  It made quite an impact on me as far as allowing
my girlfriend to go on long road trips, especially alone.

My prayers go out to her family at this time.  I know that closure can also
reopen wounds and throw salt in them in many ways.

Everyone take care and be grateful for what you have today.
