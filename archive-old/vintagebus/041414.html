&gt; I confess - I was driving with a bailing wire apparatus but now
&gt; it's time to do it right.  
Being a city boy, I use coat hangars.:)

I would like to hear from other bus owners where
&gt; they mounted their oil filter at?  I ended up decided that I will bolt it to
&gt; the frame in the little cubby formed by the left rear fender and corner
&gt; sheetmetal.
I think you are talking about the same place most people use.  I saw this
on the VanBondo RFH and didn't think it was so good to have the filter at
45 degrees, but after looking at it to do my own, it seemed like the best
way.  It is tucked up some this way and it is inboard of the tire.  In
both my buses there was already one hole drilled there in the frame.  On
the 67 i also ran a 72 plate cooler just forward of the torsion tubes.
It is &quot;JP welded&quot; by a flat stock frame.  Going to put the fan on
tomorrow.  

&gt;  The
&gt; only problem is that I need a 360 degree swivel compression fitting to allow
&gt; the oil lines to run up and under the frame without putting them under a lot
&gt; of stress.  I have one but need 2.  
Are you talking about AN fittings?  They are usually readily available at
places that work on hydraulic hose.  You need to make a gentle arc with
the lines so they hang just under the heater boxes.  Try the tractor
places.  They have 45,90 degree adapter fittings.  On my filter adapter
I use one 90 degree pipe to AN.  Then on the other port I run a
straight pipe to AN with an AN8 to AN8 90 or 45 fitting that can be
swiveled.
