&gt; Some time ago, during a busy/hectic period, I saw, but lost the message from
&gt; a rubber/seal supplier who is on the list.  This person mentioned a listee
&gt; discount, and also a possible quantity discount.  [...]

&gt; Who was this masked supplier, and what do you think?  At one point, I
&gt; calculated a list of needs, and it came out to around $800....

I purchased every piece of rubber possible for my double cab from Bus Depot
By my calculations, I saved about $350 to the nearest competitor
