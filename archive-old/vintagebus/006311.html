gulp!

i gotta do this and its gonna hurt - but plans are going ahead that we hoped
to have in place by now - but after a crash last year in the '60 camper -
its slowed things down a bit.

so i've now come to a point that i've got to sell the '54 kombi. :(

anyone looking to buy a 54 lhd barn door kombi should contact me for more
details - pictures available - if you want to see something in particular i
can go take a picture. if its bought by someone accross the pond - i can
help in 'time and effort' to get it shipped to you - but shipping/transport
costs will have to be paid by the purchaser. arangement aren't a problem

it comes complete with the correct year bus engine and correct
exhaust/heater boxes. crank handle etc.
a full length wood slat roof rack
and a rear load full of spares including:
part of a 54 bus rear chassis - torsion bars, pair of lever shocks, complete
transaxle. and a large box full of spare parts.

paintwork is tatty - but body and chassis are very solid - a 'little bit' (2
hour job) of welding that was needed has been done. no rear corners to
replace, no front arches, no sills, all original metal! no usual 12 inch all
round, cab floor is good, load area is good - no usual holes in the
corners - this bus is very solid.

If you need to know more - ask - i will be as honest and upfront about the
whole condition and descriptions as i would want from someone else.

it is a good one!
