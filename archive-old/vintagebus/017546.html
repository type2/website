To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok...I just got my safari's from California.  As I
look at the bill, I see that I was charged $35 on a
$425 order.  When I called up Izz, I was told they
must charge everyone tax, unless shipped to AZ.  I've
never paid out of state tax before in my life over
mail order.  Whats the story?
