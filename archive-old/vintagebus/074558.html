Subject: Re: Coffee Names - WOW!!

What a great thread!

I liken my coffees to gears
1st wakes you up and gets you started,
2nd is just there to get you 3rd
3rd is where you come to the realization that you are now part of the 
world and can keep up with everyone else
4th is where you're just cruisin' around and making good progress, you 
know, getting there
Reverse happens sometime right after lunch


..and yes, i can be classified as an obsessive compulsive extremist 
attention deficit perfectionist no sleep nuerotic pack rat - and I love 
every minute of it! :)
