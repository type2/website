Here in the states there's a slight premium for KPH speedos, based on
the novelty factory.  In the civilised, metric world, it's the other
way 'round.

You should be able to get ~$3000 for it on ebay.

&gt; I just bought a NOS in the box (box is worse for the wear), kilometer

&gt; I thought it was a NOS mph, but turned out to be km.  It goes up to 120 km,
&gt; and is mint. Is this one worth more here in the states than the mph speedo?
