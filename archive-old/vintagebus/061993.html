Subject: RE: [VB] re:rhino liner

No hard feelings. Likewise I hope.

But I still stand behind what I said.

I guess I'm just a little &quot;pissy&quot; right now. My problem for sure...not 
yours Rich. Guess I'll need to wash the grease out from under my 
fingernails so my wife will spend a &quot;little quality time&quot; with me after the 
kids go to bed. That should just about solve my problem!

&gt;
&gt;Everyone is chatting about how they want to spray Rhino-liner all over
&gt;their buses and I was just adding a friendly reminder that this stuff is
&gt;MUCH worse than just a layer of paint or some other coating to remove. I
&gt;was using the term &quot;jackass&quot; in general and not pointing any fingers at
&gt;anyone.
&gt;
&gt;I have no beef against you or anyone else on here, just putting some
&gt;words of caution out.
&gt;
&gt;My apologies for any hard feelings...

&gt;I hope at the same time he's cussing the same Jackass (me) for taking a
&gt;basket case bus and putting it back on the road.
&gt;
&gt;I personally could give a rat's ass what some new owner thinks about
&gt;what
&gt;I've done to my bus. If they don't like it they don't have to buy it.
&gt;It's
&gt;mine right now and IF I choose to Rhino Liner the bed....so be it.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not here to serve others opinions of how what is the &quot;correct&quot; way
&gt;to
&gt;make my truck a functional vehicle again. That's why I prefaced the
&gt;question with the fact that it won't be a stock restoration.
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty sure everyone knows that if you don't do something stock that
&gt;
&gt;there are people that won't agree. Do we have to go through this every
&gt;single time someone on this list asks a question that doesn't fit
&gt;other's
&gt;opinion of a stock job?
&gt;
&gt;Maybe an over-reaction on my part....but being called a jackass doesn't
&gt;sit
&gt;well with me.
