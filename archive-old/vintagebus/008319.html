Oh dear! I thought it looked quite good actually - as Mike G said, 'it's got
potential'. Then again, I am 'European' and I do like the new Beetle.

&gt;There's no way they'd build another rear engine vehicle and unless its
pedal-&gt;powered, there's not room in front for an engine.

May I refer you to the new Mercedes A-class. This has hardly any 'nose' as
the bulk of the engine is sited under the drivers feet. It's got similar
tall, brick like qualities. (ugly in other words)

Actually, it got me wondering how the bay window buses were looked upon when
they first came out. Much as I like to see them on the roads, they're not as
good looking as a Split! Did the owners have the p**s taken out of them like
N** B****** owners do in the UK by the air-cooled vintage snobs.(Like
myself!!)

Just a thought
