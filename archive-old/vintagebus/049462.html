Subject: Re: [VB] nomenclature, was brake lights


&gt;:  &gt; As was pointed out to me recently, the little bulbs in the headlight
&gt;:  buckets are only supposed to be on when the headlight switch is pulled out
&gt;:  to the first click.  When the headlights are on (second click) these lights
&gt;:  are off.

&gt;I believe this change happened in '62 or '63.  My '60 acts the same as
&gt;Everett's.

This was pretty common until the early 60s...  our 50 Ch*vy 1/2 ton is the
same way. 'Parking lights' were for just that - being on when the vehicle
was occupied, but on the side of the road.
