Subject: RE: [VB]Factory Tools (Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...)

In the book that I'm referring too, that's exactly what is done.  It is my understanding that the
book was printed by VW, for VW!

This book would state the description, item #, what all it's used for, a pic, and a blue print
spec diagram drawn to scale with exact dimensions and possibly tensile strengths, when necessary.

&gt; They don't even give you the dimensions, you have to go through VW to get
&gt; the drawing to make one !

&gt; Is that the book whose content basically states something like &quot;You Need A
&gt; Tool Now? Here's what
&gt; it looks like and the dimensions... make it your self.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Can you PLEASE post that book on VintageBus?!?!  Or if anybody knows what
&gt; I'm talking about,
&gt; please post it.  I've never seen one, only have friends and old VW mechs
&gt; that have.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Travis

&gt; &gt; Sounds like I'll have to dig out my factory VW tool book for you guys.
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; book has every tool listed for VW's with pics of them all.

&gt; &gt;      I suprized to hear no mention of the other wonderful spring plate 
&gt; &gt; tools. (brb head'n for the shop).  Bummer mine is numberless, does have a 
&gt; &gt; bunch of German writing on it.  I've scored the factory fluid level 
&gt; &gt; protractor a few years back.  It makes setting up spring plates a breeze,
&gt; &gt; oh, great for checking camber too.   As for the spring plate jack, I made
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; own.
