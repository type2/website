Subject: re: child seat

Has anyone had any luck putting a childs seat in the back of a westy
walkthrough? I'm thinking of attaching a seatbelt to the seat behind the

drivers, just wanted to see if there were any other ideas.

Thanks - Tim  67 Westy


I'm going through the same thing right now.  I was told that putting the
seat behind the driver seat was a bad idea, but that would depend on the
type of seat you have.  We just bought one that is forward facing for
when your child is 20 pounds or more.  We were told to put it in the
center of the bed/seat in the rear.  Only problem I ran into is where to
install the rear strap since there is no rear clip to attach the strap
like in my 97 Jetta.  Our seat came with an extra clip, we just haven't
figured where to install it.
