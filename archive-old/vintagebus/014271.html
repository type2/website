Don't give up yet NQ! you have been a bit of an inspiration for me, I
appreciate all your constant updates...I have always been overwhelmed by your
ability to conccot something or other to tackle any problem and the speed that
you seemed to work on your project. 
I guess as mine is a daily driver it is a bit harder to work on, as anybig
project has the potential to sideline the bus for a few weeks while I search
for replacement parts, or have the time to do the job properly. It sounds like
you may have just been a bit to anzious or quick, but it is hard to tell in
computer land, try slowing down, and not setting unrealisatic goals.

It is important to walk away from a project every now and then to refresh your
own batteries. 

Good luck and hang in there.
