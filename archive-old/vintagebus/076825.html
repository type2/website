Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny for 59

Is your 59 a split case tranny bus that you are putting a tunnel case tranny 
in?   The split case buses have a round rubber mount thingy that goes into a 
round hole around teh nose cone.    Or you can post your VIN #

to put a tunnel case tranny in, you need an adaptor.

yup, it does need a nose cone on the tranny.

I need some help getting a tranny into my 59.  I pulled to one in it but it
was the wrong one.  It looked like a later model.  The nose wasn't even
attached.

What can I put in there.  What about the mount for the nose?

Thanks

Richard
