Subject: RE: [VB] Here the h*ll is it / door rubber

  In my research and a lot of looking and talks with some of the VW Gods,
you have the correct door rubber which is 67 only. WCM when they reproduced
the rubber copied the 67 profiles. NOBODY makes the correct front door post
rubber YET for pre 67 buses. The upper rubber from belt line to belt line
has an indent from sometime in 63 on.

Curt asked about door rubber and Wade replied with his great photo
essay, but they both leave me with a question.  Was all front door
rubber originally rectangular (with two slightly rounded corners)?

I still have what I consider to be original rubber on my '67 and it
seems to me there were three different profiles for the four pieces.  I
agree that the bottom piece (along the dogleg) was rectangular w/rounded
corners and that the rear (at the latch) was the same profile.

The top piece (around the window frame) on mine is close to that but is
indented along the sealing surface (that is, against the window frame)
and the front piece (at the hinge side of the door) is more trapezoidal.

Is this just one of those things where reproducers got lazy and repopped
only the rectangular profile?  Or was the rectangular stuff standard on
everyone's bus?  Or am I just picking nits here?
