Subject: Engine trouble solved, new problem arises

Thanks to all who helped me with my pulsating engine.  It turned out to
be a air leak.  I was so certain i had tha covered too.

Anyway, i rebuilt the motor from the short block up to take care of some
oil leaks.  It sounds a runs a whole lot better as long as i do not
idle.  Right now it is have a heck of a time idling.  It wants to
stall.  Restarts every time and right away, but...

I suspect that it may be carboration.  I turn the adjusting screw
around, but get no responce.  Does this sound like a carb problem?   the
idle adjust screw on the carb arm is all the way in.  The fuel/air
mixture is about 3 turns out right now.

Any fearther help out there.  Could this still be a air leak problem?

Thanks

Matthew
