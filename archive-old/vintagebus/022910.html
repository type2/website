I had a similar dilemma when I was selling my '56.  The potential buyer,
with whom I'd spoken to at length on the phone, made a committment to buy
it on a certain date.  Fine.  He called/emailed twice to slip the date, and
I cut him some slack.  In the mean time, two of the &quot;transporter exorters&quot;
called and hounded me to sell it to them.  I could have made a little more
money, and got it quicker, but I held out.  Sure enuf, the other guy
finally came thru, after 2 1/2 months, and now the bus is living the dry
life in Arizona.

OTOH, there's a lotta tire kickers out there.  People who make committments
to cars/parts/etc and drag their heels scouting for a better deal.  The
general rule of thumb should be, if you want it, cough up the cash ASAP so
there's no issues.  Not everyone is going to cut you slack while you make
up your mind, sell the wife to pay for it, etc.  If you're in the market
for a bus, make sure you have some liquid cash close at hand so you can
move.  Don't plan in terms of &quot;I'll sell the baja when I find a bus I want
to buy.&quot;  - Sell the baja *now* and bank the cash, so you're ready to go,
and then step up the search.
