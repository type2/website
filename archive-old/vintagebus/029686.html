I hit a Great Dane in my '71 bus once.  Cried the whole way home. 
Another time I saw a deer leap onto the highway in broad daylight, get
hit, and go spinning along the surface of the pavement like a stone. 
Unfortunately, my 11-year-old daughter saw it too.  A friend hit a deer
and it came through the windshield, still alive, hooves flailing.

Aren't cars a great pal to our animal friends, let alone the effects of
paving and pollution?  May I recommend Florida author Carl Hiassen's
works (latest is &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;) -- for a character called Skink, who eats
nothing but roadkill.  Maybe car owners should be required to eat a
couple of roadkill meals a year....

Aw, it's OK.  We'll pave their environment long before we roadkill em
all.

Make mine 'possum,
joe
