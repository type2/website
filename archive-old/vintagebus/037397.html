Subject: Panel interior----
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone--
Any creative people have some good ideas of what I should do w/ the interior 
of my restored '59 panel? I had a SO-42 westy interior that I was gonna use, 
but it was for a wide hatch bus so I sold it to someone who needed it for 
their westy... 
Right now it's grey metal (stock), but I want to have something a bit more 
user friendly which looks Really nice to compliment the rest of the bus!
This may be a bit off topic, but i'd love some ideas!!!

Thanks alot-Pete
