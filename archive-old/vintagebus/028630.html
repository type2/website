is push button but any reason it won't Fit?  63 panel and 67 deluxe incase

the size is the same but the latch has been changed for unknown reasons.   The
67 latch will not latch a 63 apron.   66 and 67 have a different apron for the
push button latches.    so theoretically you could put the lid and apron from
the 67 onto the 63.

now you won't be able to prop it up.   the 55-63 elbow engine prop was dropped
in dec 63 in favor of the spring style one.   The spring on the 67 lid won't
find a roller on the 63 bus.

I would look for a 59 - 63 engine lid for the 63.
