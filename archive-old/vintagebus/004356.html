I have a 65 Crew Cab. The apron on it looks funky. I think I remember from
my other busses that the part of the apron that has the cut-out for the pig
tail is supposed to be vertical to the ground.

On my Crew, that part of the apron is horizontal to the ground. It doesn't
look like it has been bent, indeed, it seems that it was made that way. Is
the apron on the 65 Crew different from the 65 Transporter?
