Subject: Re: [VB] The Split Bus Club (Calif.)--anyone know if this group
  is still  going?

Hey Tom-
   
  You can try this email, it is the one that just forwarded the OBRLite to me a few days ago.
   
  Splitbc_at_aol_dot_com 
   
  I think they still do stuff on rare ocassions but I think it's the real old core group as I was a member but never hear about them till after they have passed.
