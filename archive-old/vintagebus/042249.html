&gt; What could someone in PHX *possibly* do with a boat?

I lived in Tucson and saw a VW bug _floating _ down the street during an
afternoon monsoon.  It may be dry most of the time, but when it gets wet
in Arizona it gets really exciting!

More likely because they are really heavy, IIRC.  You probably don't want
to carry it around all that much.
