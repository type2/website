Subject: '59 Single cab...bed is blasted!!!!

Finally!

For the last month or so I've been having to spend my free time 
working on a house we bought in town. Yes...we're having to leave the 
Ranch. The owner is moving back and will be selling the property. So 
a month or so ago we bought a fixer upper house in town. I wanted to 
stay in the country...but my wife said no. She's tired of having to 
drive all the way into town to go anywhere. So we comprimised and 
I'll be getting a 24 X 24 garage/shop in addition to the 10 X 20 out 
building already on the property. There's also a carport big enough 
for 2 or 3 cars. So plenty of room to work...not so much room for 
storing VW's though. I'm spoiled to the barn here. But I get to still 
use it until the property sells. Anyway....

Today I snuck in about 7 hours of sand blasting and finally finished 
blasting the bed of my '59 truck. And I finally got it finished. I've 
rattle can primered it along the way to keep it from flash rusting.

I keep going back and forth on what I will do with the bed. It's 
pitted and dented up pretty good. I bought some POR-15 
(http://www.por15_dot_com/ ) and what I'm thinking I'm gonna do now is go 
ahead and put it on there. I'll have to get the primer I sprayed 
off....but that'll take about 15-30 minutes with the sandblaster at 
the most. I've used POR-15 in the past and it does a pretty good job 
of settling into pitted metal and sorta smoothing it out. Plus it 
should keep it from rusting again. Greg S. and a few other listees 
suggested this route and it looks like right now that's what I'm 
probably gonna do.

I had considered Rhino Lining the bed, but I think I'm gonna 
experiment with the Whitecote product from POR-15. It's a UV 
resistant top coat than can be applied right over their POR-15 and 
they say it's tough as nails. I wanted a white colored truck 
bed....so I'm gonna give it a shot. It'll cost me $45 and if for some 
reason I end up not liking it I can always save up the $500 or so for 
Rhino. But I think the Whitecote will do what I want.

That means I'm probably gonna go ahead and put wood slats in there. 
I'll also be fabricating some panels for the side and rear gates out 
of diamond plate. They'll be POR-15 and Whitecote as well.

The Rancho freeway flyer tranny I ordered from Ronnie at 
http://www.type2parts_dot_com came in Friday afternoon. So it looks like 
I'll need to start getting things together to put the upright T4 
engine together. Fun Fun Fun.
