Subject: RE: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

In Florida the tag stays with the seller.  That tag is worth $100 bucks!
I have an old tag that I have used twice because its not listed in the
state puter anymore.  Luckily I'm in the military so I never have to
turn it in.  I just tell the DMV person on the phone that I am wherever
the hell I am stationed at the time and they give me a credit and then
tell me not to use that tag again.  Hopefully I won't have more than
three cars in the future but if I do I will pull that trust old FL
license plate out and try it again.  Now don't nobody go tellin on me
:-) Oh yeah, I should prolly wait till I'm done playing at Macdill.
