Subject: Re: [VB] Brake pedal dillema

Thanks Ronnie,

The odd part of it is that there is space for an O-ring on both ends of the 
bushing housing. Anyone have thoughts or information about that?

I tried installing a standard inch sized O-ring but it seemed larger than 
the old one that I removed and put back. I will look for metric rings and 
see if there is one a little smaller that might be appropriate.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt; hi chris, i just had mine apart, and i'm confident there was no o-ring in 
&gt; there.
