Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Weatherstrip problems

I just installed this bus depot $59 seal in my bus and it fits
perfectly.   It's definitely a high quality part.

&gt; Can anyone recommend the best source for weatherstrip/seal for the
&gt; rear door.  on my 70 bus. I've had problems with poorly fitting  
&gt; weatherstrip in the past.
  
&gt; I have tried the cheapo seal from Bus Depot but it was horrible.He no 
&gt; longer shows the cheapo seal I bought. His looks just like the one
from
&gt; ISP West. http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211829193C
&gt; Not sure what Bus Depot means by 1950 to 1971....... I think Ron meant

&gt; to say 1964 to 1971.
