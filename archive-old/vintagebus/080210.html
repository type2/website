Subject: Re: [VB] instrument panel is now installed_sort-of

Just to keep this bus information going we have used similar wet 
installation in boats for Years, but we do live in the High desert.:)
P &amp; C
And yes the passenger can keep track of what the driver is doing which 
can be bad or good, O the motor monitoring is good :)
The angle could be better with the angle bezels available some where. 
And this could keep the copilot in the dark. HAHA!
The big plus is this can be returned to stock easily.
And yes it is a good night light.


&gt;   We have not liked this mounting of gauges in the fresh air vent because of 
&gt; all the water that gets up in there.  Plus the viewing is harder due to both 
&gt; angle and darkness when bright sunny outside.  Still it is good to have the 
&gt; gauges and the passengers can easily monitor them to help keep an eye on what the 
&gt; engine is doing.
