Early '67's (i.e. built in late '66 but sold as '67's) came with
single-circuit master cylinders.  This is why some FLAPS will sell you a
single circuit m/c and tell you it fits your '67; their book doesn't clearly
state that it only fits *some* (read: a small portion of) '67's.

&gt; Did 67 T2's ever come with single master cylinders?  Or did some yahoo PO
&gt; put one on my bus just for fun?
