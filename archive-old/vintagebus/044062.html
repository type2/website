I am running a 1600 DP with 009, oil bath air cleaner, and pea-shooter
exhaust.  The main jet was stamped 120, but I don't remember the others or
the emulsion tube.  I did not change the float height.  The choke
mechanism and cut-off valve both work. This setup has worked well on this
engine before, but the gasket that seals the top to the bowl had developed
a leak, so I, overzealous rookie that I am,  rebuilt the whole thing.

&lt;&lt; Any thoughts before I bite the bullet and take this thing in to a
&gt;professional? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Tristan,
&gt;Only if you can supply more info!  Like engine size, distributor, was
this
&gt;carb working fine before on this engine, what size are the jets, and did
&gt;you
&gt;measure them or just go by the stampings on the jets, Etc, etc......
