cut the rubber donut off. with a sharp knofe or razor blade.  The metal 
cylinder inside it is the rusted tricky part. What I found works best is 
grind a flat spot on the side of the metal tube that is stuck/rusted on 
there. (use proper ear and eye protection.  A file will work, though it is 
slow) Then, with some penetrating oil and vise grips (which now have a place 
to grab) you can twist that sucker off

&lt;&lt; Hey list,
 
 Hope you all can help me out!  I'm trying to put new shocks on the front of 
 my 66 deluxe and when I took off the old shock the race/hollow tube stayed 
 on the steering knuckle (not sure what to call it the lower shock bolt) and 
 the old shock now just has the delabitated rubber donut with no metal 
 spacer.  Any Ideas on how to get this off.  I'm equiped with a phase I tool 
 kit.  I'm gonna drench it with liquid wrench and try ye ol vice grips but I 
 don't think they grab.  I'm hopin to get this resolved tonight I don't feel 
 like the old shock is a safe way to go for now!
