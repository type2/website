And I think we are pushing the definition of &quot;archives&quot; a bit
simplistically.  Sure, a list can automatically archive, but the original
VANAGON list has been split at least twice (VANAGON / TYPE2, then TYPE2 /
VINTAGEBUS), been hosted at least five places using who knows how many
different software programs.

The bottom line is that [back when the i405_dot_com archives were started] we
had no archives for x period of months ... we put something together to
allow access to years worth of lost e-mail.  It was far better than _no
archives_, but by no means did it address bandwidth and server location
concerns (I am often away from my house for _days_, this isn't a co-location
site).  In fact, at the time, the list itself had big server location
concerns -- it collapsed in the disconnect at the end of last year.

I made my contribution to the list... 

Alas, there isn't much in terms of technical computer excuses, the archives
could have been much better managed.  But I have been spending the last six
months working -- very unsuccessfully -- on my VW!  I've learned a lot, I
just hope I've learned enough to get the damn thing running before I try to
drive 5000 miles in 10 days!

Now, back to that damn new engine and new dual Kadrons... trying to go
against list wisdom and actually understand how to make them work :)

&gt;         That's one of the things I don't understand about the archives --
&gt;why is there any delay at all in archiving???  My only experience with
&gt;running a list is with majordomo, but with that, it's automatic. Why isn't
&gt;it here?

The archive lives on an entirely different system (Stephen Gutknecht's
vw.i405_dot_com, which he maintains entirely at his own expense) and the
messages have to be moved into it manually, which is not done often because
it is a real chore.

We're looking at a MySQL/WebMerger system run out of the type2_dot_com box; we
have the horsepower now to run real database muscle where we didn't used
to. That one will have a message lag of no more than 23.9 hours and
blazingly fast search/retrieve. If the UNIX gods smile I may be able to
have it up this weekend. They never smile though.
