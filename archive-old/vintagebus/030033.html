Subject: goofed with goof-off

&lt;&lt;I figured-out that the only non-abrasive thing
which took the black paint off of DARTHVW's dash and
cab interior was Goof-off(tm)&gt;&gt;

Jason,

I would have used easy off oven cleaner. Strips paint off like crazy
except for baked on enamel. I think it's lye based. Dangerous stuff too
but I think I would take my chances there than with a helix based
chemical..

Drink fruit juices to clear your kidneys/ liver.

Be careful :)

Les
