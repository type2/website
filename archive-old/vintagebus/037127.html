&lt;&lt; Eric &amp; Barb,
 I am going to try to find some FV guys to see if anything is available for a 
jet gauge.&gt;&gt;

Hi Andy,
Please keep us updated as we know others on the list have look for a jet 
gauge with no luck.

&lt;&gt;

It would be good to know for sure.  We were going off memory and you know how 
that can go!

&lt;&gt;
Used or new it is amazing how far off they can be!   Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
