From my VW Theology Library: According to St. Berg, the steel seats and =
brass guides were used from the start. It was the introduction of hard =
chrome valve stems on the exhaust valves that made the heads compatable =
with unleaded gas. Stainless steel valves also get the job done.

Hoping to attain enlightenment,
Dave


&gt;&gt;This brings to mind a question I had about running original VW intake =
valves
&gt;with regular gas in a 36hp motor.

&gt;&gt;I always thought it was the valve _seats_, in the head, that were the
problem.  The early seats were made out of a softer material and the =
lead
in the fuel helped to keep the valves from wearing the seats down.  =
Seats
for unleaded fuel are harder and don't erode, even without the =
lubrication
from the lead.  The valves may have changed too, but I think the valve
seats were the big change.
