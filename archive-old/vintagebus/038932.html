After pulling the 66 DLX's 1600DP, I power washed the engine bay,
undercarriage and went crazy on the stripped cab section.
Engine was running poorly, as in hot start difficulty, easily stalled, and
moderate power when behaving well.
The plugs were black with a dark grey electrode, a shiny black, not globby.
Says high heat plus oil to me.
Leak down test _at_ cyl 1 equaled 98psi vs 100 for 2 percent leak.
Following the prodecure that 180 deg counter gives the next cyl at tdc, I
hit 2 3 and 4 in that order, then individually test each cyl again at 1 4 32
in standard firing order. Each test in all three other cyls gave a result of
60/100 or worse, with audible air from both heads and somewhere
Please tell me I did something wrong, although i am fairly sure I didn't,
and have both questionable heads and rings.
I also unlashed all vlaves thinking they were too tight and causing a valve
to expel the air at TDC, but leak down tests were consistantly poor in all
cyls, but #1

Since I already have a push rod tube lea and a crankcase seal, I am
contemplating a turn key new motor for this bus, since shop space, or lack
thereof prevents me from rebuilding a motor. GEX has NEW mexician motors
with all acc for 2100, I was wondering since these are new and not GEx if
they are ok, and contain the tin with the flaps an tstat, as I prefer as
stock as possible.
Thanks,
AL
