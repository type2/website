Subject: valve-seat cutting tools...

I offer up this question to the list... 
	Does anyone have a lead on a VW valve seat cutter tool? The seats on my
new heads seem to have a 45-degree cut on them. 
	The kind of tool I'm talking about would have an 8 mm stub sticking out
of it that would ride in the valve guide, for proper location of the
tool. The cutting bit would have a 45 degree face on it... With a good,
long, stub, it should be accurate enough for someone to use even on a
hand drill, but a drill press would be better, IMHO.
	But... since we're all using the hardened valve seats nowadays, any
rules on cutting the hardened seats? tool rpms? 
	I found a company that I could probably get to make me a 45-degree, 8mm
guide... seat cutter, but I have not contacted them because I thought i
would ask here first... If it's already made up, it was made probably in
a batch and would be cheaper to buy.
	The Sermons tell me that the most common way to get the cc volume equal
in all four chambers is by sinking the valves... so I thought I'd ask
around as to the seat cutters. Maybe there is one cutter out there that
would be applicable to most VW valve widths... or several different ones
might be better...  I have probably 20 heads or less that I plan on
rebuilding, and prefer doing all this myself instead of farming it out
to a machine shop... as I'm sure I'll be doing a few more than that in
the future.
