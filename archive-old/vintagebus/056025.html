Subject: RE: [VB] leaking crew cab

Sounds like a good time to get in the bus and let the kids hose it off...

Water in the parcel tray would mean wiper seals or the squirter nozzles if
you have them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;3DPete pondered:

Hi List,
I was wondering if there are &quot;typical&quot; spots where
water gets into a spittie, more specifically, a crew
cab. Mine has all new weather stripping but everytime
it rains or I wash it, it gets considerable water in
the floorboard of the rear seat section. I know one
place it gets in when I'm drivning in heavy rains is
through the upper fresh air vents. I'm gonna try to
address that issue this afternoon with a new seal up
there. As to the rear floor, any ideas would be
greatly appreciated. Oh, BTW, when it rains and when I
wash it, I seem to always get water in the parcel
tray. Please respond if'n ya have any ideas 'bout
this.
