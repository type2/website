Hey all - I've got a question about the op relief valves I installed in my
engine.  They are the ones that came out of this engine.  Both of the valves
are identical in size.  Yet when checking the RMMW catalog (the one with the
blue 70's bug on the front) they show on page 22 a set of springs, washers,
plugs, and relief valves.  One valve has a groove around the top (pictured
on the left) and the other one doesn't (right).  Both of mine look like the
one one on the right.  Is this correct or so I have a botched OP valve in my
engine?
