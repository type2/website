Zac,

Here's what I would do. Unbolt the reduction gear box from the spring
plate again. Take the upper outer bearing off the end of the shaft
again. Unbolt the lower end of the shock absorber. Disconnect all the
brake stuff (that's already done, right?). Now, crawl up under the
middle of the bus so you can see the tranny. If you take a good look
at where the axle connects, you'll see two sets of nuts in circles on
the sides of the tranny. The smaller diameter set (there's six of
them) holds down a sheet metal thing that your axle boots used to be
connected to (back when you had boots 8^) ). Remove the six nuts that
hold the sheet metal thing to the tranny. Now, you might have to
loosen up the transmission mounts to get the big flange on the end of
the axle over the frame horn that holds the tranny. The flange is
what's under that sheet metal thing you just took off the side of the
tranny. I've done this before and didn't find it to be too bad, but
now that I've typed this up I think I had my engine out. That would
make it easier to get to the trans mount bolts. I'm pretty sure you
can do this even with the engine in so I'll send this anyway.

Have Fun
