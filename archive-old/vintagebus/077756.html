Subject: RE: [VB] Battery hold down

One thing I have found out about wood under the battery, use a solid
piece of wood or plywood, not particle board. The particle board will
absorb the battery acid, and you know what happens with cellulose and
acid under the right conditions! I sure do, got pics of a burned out 56
International pickup!

Perusing the archives, someone mentioned to definitely not put in one of
those 'battery mats' under the battery that is supposed to absorb acid,
ends up holding in acid and moisture, yikes.  I think I'll make a nice
wooden platform for the battery to sit on, about 1-3/4&quot; to 2&quot; thickness
should do
the trick.   That'll get the battery tall enough that the original strap
will hold it down nicely.  I have read of these OG battery covers, must
be one of the rare of the rare items. Never seen one...

Thanks
Gary
