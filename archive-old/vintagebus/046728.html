I'll be putting up some more pics of my headliner on the deluxe soon. 
Thanksgiving weekend I tried putting a corner window in and broke it. 
thanks to Neil Pickett for getting me another window.  (I got it today, your
check is on the way)  Not sure what to do about the windows, I don't want to
break any more.  Anyone have any tips for the corner windows, those are the
only kind I've never installed.

I never did the corner windows either,   are yours wth laminated glass or 
sekurit?    Let us know how it goes-  , use lots of lube I guess, and warm 
the rubber up first so it is more supple.(in the sun?  ha ha)
