hi all,

I recently acquired a locking gas cap for a splitty as part of a deal.

I managed to pick it and figure finding a blank that fits and filing a
key/rekeying will be no big whoop...(it has screws on teh back to
dis-assemble for locksmithing work...)

The problem is its seal has disintergrated...  Has anyone ever seen one of
these and do you have any idea how i might be able to reseal it without
the original seal being intact? i'll have to start shoppin around i
guess to see if i can come up with something that fits.

thanks,

steve
