Hello Matt   Have you tried to remove the jets on the sides of the carb and 
check for crud and spray out with carb cleaner using one with a nozzle. Also 
after cleaning and if it still does it try loosing the jets and driving a short 
distance to see what happens. Also why doesn't your carb have the electic cut 
off solenoid?? Has it been replaced with a manual one ?  later and have fun
