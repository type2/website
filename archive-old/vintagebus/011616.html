Subject: rusty gas tank 
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 1998 16:09:54 -0400


 I finally got my bus on the road yesterday. After having the reduction box
fixed.
I drove about 20 miles before my car shut off. I tried to start it but
couldn't get it to run.
it was dark and i didnt notice till this morning that my gas through the
fuel filter had a brown hue to it. I've read what the library says about
gummed up tanks but dont know if this applies to me. How do I go about
cleaning my tank. do I use the same steps. Any
help is most appreciated. 
	thanks marcos
