Subject: chrome bumpers

--part1_14b.c0c0ff4.29e5f6b5_boundary

I know I have sent this out before with very little feed back so I am trying 
again.  I need a set of chrome bumpers for a 1959 panel van.  The can already 
be done, be new,  be old,  or being dipped, I can take care of the shipping. 
If you know some one that has a set or has had a set done please let me know. 
 I need them ASAP.
Increase the Peace
