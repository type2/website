&gt; .  The question is one of them is a plug in light bulb type I believe its a 
&gt; 12 volt 
&gt; with a spring holding the bulb in the socket.  the other is a 6 volt bulb 
&gt; and 
&gt; the light is held in by a twisting type metal hold down.  The housing 
&gt; doesnt 
&gt; look like they can be interchanged or is there something that I am missing? 
&gt; 

Hi Rick,
Sounds like the first one is a 12 volt H-4 non-sealed halogen setup.   The 
second sounds like a vintage non-sealed bulb.
