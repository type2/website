I used to be a commercial account manager for Kinko's. I know they make
calendars.
Take in your color bus photos (or files) and they can make you as many
calendars as you would like.
Make sure you check their progress though. It's sometimes tricky to get
things done correctly.
Anyone who lives in the city, or 'burbs probably has a kinko's on every
other block (next to Starbucks).
John
