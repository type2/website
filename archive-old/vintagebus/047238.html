&lt;&lt; Of the yellow and white wires, which is the high beam and which is the low 
beam??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Thomas,
White should be high beam, but best to test this.  After dark pull yyour bus 
up to a building and with the headlights turned on switch the dimmer switch.  
When the blue idiot light is on so should be your high beams.  As you switch 
back and forth between high and low beam you should notice the low beam is 
aimed lower than the high beam.  Then just reach under the dash and remove 
the fuse from the high beams.  If both high beams no longer works, but both 
low beams still do they are wired correctly.  Repeat this removal of fuse 
test with the low beams.  Eric&amp;Barb
