Subject: Early ribbed bumpers...value?
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990912172348.00799210_at_mail.flashmail_dot_com&gt;

Was wondering if some of you could p-mail me the going rate for a set of
early T2 ribbed bumpers in excellent condition. I realize there are highs
and lows. I just want to get what they'd sell for most of the time. TIA
