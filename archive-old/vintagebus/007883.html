Here's the link right to my bus.

http://www.classicvws_dot_com/woody.htm

The nose was replaced on this bus .The previous owner had hit a deer
and the repair was a hack job at best.The belly pans were removed and
painted underneath them and then used as templates for the 54 Barndoor 
deluxe they did last year,and then installed back on my bus.
A '67 rebuilt front beam and steering box.
A '67 rear end with 3.88 r&amp;p trans.
A 1776 single port.
Brm's with 195/65x15's.
I am amassing a killer stereo system now to install.

    I should be attending the Wolfsburg West show on Dec.2nd
before I drive it back to Chicago.
