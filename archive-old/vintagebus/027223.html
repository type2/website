Subject: Adjusting clutch?

Okay, so how do you all adjust the clutch on your buses with heater
boxes?  I cannot for the life of me get a good enough grip on that
sucker with the heater box in the way. BTW i never had this problem
before since I did not have heat, does that thing I see in the catalogs
work?  You know, it looks like this:

                                                   ______
                                                   |           |
                                            ___ |           |___
                                            |                        |
                                            |___            ___|
                                                   |           |
                                                   |_____ |
