Subject: Engine Power Loss, cooling problems, overheating

Hi Matthew,
First check your cooling fan for any rags/paper or other debris in it.  Is 
the fan belt too loose, belt pulleys missing thier keys, or are you using a 
power pulley?  Also check that the thermostatic bellows is opening fully and you 
have the flaps system adjusted to open full with the thermostatic bellow.  Next 
how old is the fuel in your VW?  More than about 3 months and the fuel 
degrades and gets the engine alot hotter and less HP due to burning differant from 
fresh fuel.  If you do not drive the VW often then you need to either drain the 
tank between usage or add fuel stabilizer to it.  For now if too old of fuel, 
and if the tank is less than 1/2 full get to a gas station.  Fill it with 
fresh fuel and that should take care of that possible cause.  If still no luck 
give it a full tune up, after retorquing the head studs.  Check that the 
distributor is advancing with a strobe type timing light, and while the engine is 
running try taking a spark plug wire off each plug one at a time and see if 
differance in idling speed.  No change indicates that cylinder is not creating 
power.  Also are you using a 33, 34, or better yet a 35mm wide (inside 
measurement) cooling fan?  If you use the non-doghouse 29mm or thinner cooling fans on a 
doghouse shrouded engine you will have huge cooling problems.
