 The brake light on my '56 was working just fine

 The reflective plating that was in the light has totally disintegrated

at one point there were NOS ones around for about $50.

Ed says,

Wish that I could find one.  I did look at a good used one on VW Planet a
day or two ago.  It was $50 and looked like a deal but it was different from
mine.  My bulb holder has the license plate light holder rivited to it and
the socket/screw terminal looked different as well.

Were there different types?  My bus is euro spec, maybe that's the
difference?
