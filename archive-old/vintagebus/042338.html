OK, so understand that I got into FI in the mid-80's and have not touched
a carb in nigh onto 15 years!  Now, of course, I get to re-learn
everything :-)

Last night, I started stripping the carb down and ran into something I
have forgotten (a) the function of and (b) the method of disassembly.
Take a look at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus/carb/carb1.jpg
and                                     choke_cover1.jpg
					choke_cover2.jpg
					choke_cover3.jpg

and see the item labeled &quot;damnfino&quot; :-)  it appears to be a sort of
damper for the choke, and is sure-enough non-functional, but I can't get
it off/apart.  When you pull on it, it pulls the choke open.  Anyone got
an idea as what it is and how to get it off peacefully? 

I will write up some html for the pics in that directory as soon as I
complete the set.  The intention is to have a page devoted to rebuilding
the carb, so if you have any tips, please send them!
