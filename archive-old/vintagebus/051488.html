Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ordering vw part from US to Canada


First and last comment on this thread.

A friend of mine was involved in an industry that made extensive use of 
shipping and he commented that East-West shipping has always been worse than 
North-South shipping all things being equal.  Something to do with traffic 
and volume etc.  Needless to say I after comparing I generally order to use 
North-South shipping rather than the alternative when parts quality is the 
same provider regardless.  I do order from Canada...

Bus content: Got my front bumper, very nice one from CMeanly in BC, Canada.  
Met him on his cruise South... nice guy.

&gt;&lt;&lt;I recently canceled an order from CB perfomance because shipping is too
&gt;high, and few of my friends just order stuff from RMMotorworks and were
&gt;shocked at the shipping price, even if they choose the Ground shipping, RMM
&gt;factured the high rate shipping....
&gt;
&gt;Thats why i usually choose Ebay, its easier to accomodate with the buyer on
&gt;the shipping way...
&gt;
&gt;I recently bought someting from BUGCITY.COM and now UPS called me to pay 
&gt;for
&gt;custom...arrggg .. i hate UPS !!
&gt;
&gt;Please let us choose who we want to ship... !!!&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Mike don't rag too much on our US companies.  It's a bit of a pain to ship 
&gt;to
&gt;Canada and the taxes and fees are charged on your end.  Call up your
&gt;government officials and complain.  The free trade agreement is for items
&gt;manufactured in Canada or the US, and doesn't apply to parts made 
&gt;elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;I try to send most orders to Canada by USPS, but those shipments can't be
&gt;tracked.  The post office says 7 days, when It really may take 4 weeks.  If
&gt;you are in a hurry for the item, UPS may be your only choice.  The postal
&gt;system is more expensive than UPS Standard service. USPS will not ship 
&gt;large
&gt;items we sell like our bike racks and awnings.
