Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

I'm running them on my 79 Westy, and they are not loud at all. Down the
highway, the wind makes more noise than the tires. Not bothersome at all.
Traction on wet pavement was improved tremendously, as well as snow. I give
them an overwhelming two thumbs up.

&gt; I looked into those dueler AT's...they look or rather they are labeled as
&gt; all-terrain. Generally I only drive on the road, or try to at least. Isn't
&gt; this type of tread more aggressive/louder than I need?
