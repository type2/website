Todd,

At perplexing moments like this, I always find it best to take a step back,
relax (pop a cold one, whatever) and return to BASICS.

The Basics being that it takes 3 fundamental things to make an internal
combustion engine work.
1) Compression
2) spark at the proper time
3) fuel/air mixed in the proper ratio.

First off, I know this is a new engine, but are you *absolutely* certain
that you have compression?  Did you test the motor before installing it?
Check the valves for proper adjustment?  I've rarely seen a motor come back
from the shop with adjusted valves in my experience anyways.  If they are
too tight, they may not be closing all the way and allowing the air/fuel
mixture to escape.

Second, are you certain you are getting spark?  Check the coil for
operation.  With the center wire off the coil, I hold the end of it to some
metal point of the engine - NOT the carb.!!!- about 1/8 inch away  and with
the key on, I crank the engine over by hand with a ratchet on the generator.
You should see a bright blue or white spark when the motor come around on a
firing stroke.   As for timing, make sure you know where TDC is on your
crank pulley.  To check this, pop the valve cover off the 1&amp;2 cylinder side
of the engine, and also pull the spark plug on #1.  Turn the engine over
like before, whilst watching the rockers on #1.  First you will see the
intake vale dip in.  This is the intake stroke.  After that about 90deg more
and the piston will be rising in the cylinder.  I use a screwdriver in the
spark plug hole as a probe to feel the piston coming up.  The point where
the piston is no longer travelling up, and before it begins to dive back
down is TDC. I usually feel for the point where I can perceive the piston
rising, and the point where I can perceive it going down, and split the
difference. Mark that spot on your pulley.  That's a good enough TDC for me!

Now, where do you time this sucker?   Well that depends on the dizzy you are
using.  But we just want to get the thing to start here, so 5deg. BTD is as
good a place as any to start.  (if you have an 009, and feel obligated to
use it because Hot VW's convinced you to spend 60$ on one to be kewl, set it
too 7 1/2deg. BTC).  I always time my motor statically, others swear by
those strobe light thingies that cost money.  You can make a static timing
light with stuff you probably have sitting in your tool box. The Idiot book
has excellent instructions on how to make one, use it, and time your engine,
so I won't waste our time by re-hashing it here.   You know what to do!

Thirdly, and the one that is *probably* the root of your problem, is fuel
delivery.  Are you getting gas at all through the carb?  Is the accelerator
pump working?  Well checking for gas is easy enough.  Take the five screws
off the top of the carb, and disconnect the throttle return spring too.
Remove the top and you should see your resivior full of gas with a black
floaty thing in it.  Is it floating?  Sometimes they get leaks and fill with
gas, therefore ruin your VW drivin' day.  Check the check valve on the carb.
top.  I turn it upside down and blow in the inlet tube. You should *NOT* be
able to blow through it.  Turn it over and the needle should fall freely.
Blow again.. it should be easy.

Next check your accelerator pump for operation.  With the engine in the bus,
you will probably need a piece of mirror.  (So THIS is why Muir lists that
in the phase 1 tools!!!).  The pump outlet is a small brass deal near the
throught of the carb. It come up, and then curves back down pointing into
the carb.  When you pull the throttle lever, you should get a steady, strong
stream of gasoline through the WHOLE travel of the throttle arm, right down
the throught of the carb.  The stream should also be aimed so it squirts
right at the edge of the throttle plate down in the carb.

What about the choke?  Is it working properly and adjusted?  Is the
reservoir full of crud in the bottom and thusly probably blocking up the
main jet?  How about those idle air and idle speed adjustments?  A good
starting point on a freshly cleaned carb is 2 full turns out in my
experience.


and as for dumping raw fuel down the carb, I gotten away with this a few
times, but I wouldn't recommend it except as a last resort, and only in
SMALL quantities. This is a good way of washing the oil out of your
cylinders and fouling out your shiny new Bosch spark plugs.

Have fun dude, and good luck!

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW  &quot;In ten
years,
my car will still be a classic, yours will just be OLD.&quot;

Or my current favorite: &quot;Does YOUR car have a sink?&quot;
