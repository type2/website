&gt; O ya, forgot the garage part. Garages are for the wifes new car and the
dune buggy, and the welder and wood working tools, and the beer fridge.

Nah, garages are for disassembling your Bus so the neighbors don't complain
and keeping it there so parts don't disappear.

Kick that new car to the curb where it can get hit by the sprinklers daily.
 The new car is a throw away appliance.
