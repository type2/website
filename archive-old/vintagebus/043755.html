&gt;Anyway, we made it home but my engine overheated the whole way
&gt;practically. And everything seems to be right, I cant figure it out.

Some thoughts...

You have the right fan to go with the doghouse shroud, right?  Later
fans are wider than the earlier ones.  Fan blades not missing or
bent?

Fan belt tight?  Crankshaft pulley and generator/alternator pulley
the stock size?  (Or, a bigger crankshaft pulley and/or a smaller
gen/alt pulley for more speed and better charging)

Debris inside the fan shroud or tin?

Stock heater boxes?  (With fins both inside and outside the exhaust
tube to get rid of more heat).

I think you mentioned this, but all seals in place and working?
Engine compartment door latched tight?  Side vents free and clear?
