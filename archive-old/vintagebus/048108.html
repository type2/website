&lt;&lt; Whew!!!!!  Chalk one up for the big man, Rusty Van Bondo, he has a westy
 barndoor. I think he even has some pics scanned. &gt;&gt;

I'd bet all my VW's that Van Bondo has a Barndoor Ambulance with a bastardized
camper interior in it.  Unless he happened to come across the only barn door
ever made with a pop-top.  Westy and camper are not synonymous.....there's
lots of different camper's types out there and Van Bondo happens to own 2 of
them......the barndoor (albeit a camper) isn't one from my standpoint.  Just
becasue it's got a camper interior doesnt mean it's a westy.  There's pics of
Jim's Barndoor on Thom's page  under the rare buses category.....check em
out...........www.vintagebus_dot_com

Didnt mean to ruffle any feathers, I just was excited that I could actually
correct someone on something......
