Subject: Re: [VB] 67 bus shifter flex joint

Hi Bob,  no that is not a one year only part.  It is the rear shift coupler, 
and is not supposed to flex.  It has rubber in it so it doesn't transmit 
vibration to the driver.  They are available from any VWFLAPS or VW mail 
order place- that version was used on bugs through 67 or something (i am not 
sure when exactly) and on buses 59 through 67- split case tranny buses want a 
more rubbery version else you get vibration .   They tend to cost $5 or $10.

&gt; Hello all
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 67 bus, and the flexible (rubber) connection just in front of the
&gt; transmission on the shift linkage rod is getting bad.  I was told this is a
&gt; 1 year only part, anyone know if this is true, and where I can get one??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!!
