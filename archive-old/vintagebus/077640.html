&gt; &gt; Actually, the Corvair's problem was under-inflation, coupled with a poorly
&gt; &gt; designed rear suspension that caused the tires to roll off the rim,
&gt;letting
&gt; &gt; the edge of the rim dig into the pavement.  At that point, driver becomes
&gt; &gt; passenger...
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Might want to double check your information.


Well, it's been 35 years since I read Mr. Nader's book, but that's where I 
first read about tuck-under.  Let us Google...

OK, according to a Corvair enthusiast page: 
http://www.corsaone_dot_com/CFC/Tech%20Tips/corvair_basics.htm

&quot;TIRES- most critical is proper inflation. Corvairs require a  9 to 11 
lb./sq.in. differential front to rear. The factory settings of  15 front/26 
rear (cold) are too low for sporting driving and were arrived at as a means 
of making the ride acceptably soft (by late 50's standards) and may have 
contributed to the cases of wheel rims digging into the pavement during 
avoidance maneuvers leading to rollovers.&quot;

And this, from  http://clubs.hemmings_dot_com/clubsites/nvce/FactsMyths.html:

&quot;MYTH: Corvair handling is inherently dangerous.  This allegation pertains 
to the 1960 -1963 rear suspension design which consists of a single jointed 
swing axle.  Under high cornering forces, the rear camber changes 
significantly and in extreme cases, the outside wheel can tuck under 
resulting in loss of control.  Of course, all cars lose control in extreme 
conditions so the controversy was more how the Corvair got to that point 
compared to &quot;conventional&quot; cars.  In 1972, the Department of 
Transportation, published the results of a comparison of the Corvair to 
other cars in its class including the Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, 
Volkswagen, and Renault and concluded &quot;...that the handling and stability 
of the 1960-1963 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss 
of control or rollover.....&quot;.  Most of the bad press about  the nasty 
handling characteristics of the early Corvair was highly 
exagerated,  although GM did eventually add a front anti sway bar and a 
transverse leaf spring to address the camber issue.  In 1965, the rear 
suspension was totally redesigned with a fully articulated suspension that 
eliminated the severe camber changes.  Ironically, the late model cars are 
considered some of the best handling cars made in their day.&quot;

I guess it's a common misconception...
