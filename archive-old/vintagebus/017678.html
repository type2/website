They get $20k plus for the speedster and 550 replica *kits* that you have to
go and put together yourself and supply your own running gear, and they can't 
keep up with the demand.  There's a kick-ass 917 replica, although
&quot;reproduction&quot; is probably a better word, that I would love to get.
You have to supply a 911 engine and transaxle, and some other goodies.
Still runs $45k, and the last time i looked, there was a waiting list.
Sounds like they're excited to me.

If it was all about only having the original parts on a car, then 
only a few people would have buses, because most buses need 
major work by the time we get them.  To have such lofty standards
that the bus can't have any non-OG parts and no rust sounds like
a certain pacific-rim customer base, and even they've &quot;lowered
their standards.

My '54 is going to be approximately 75% repro/replacement by the
time it's done.  There was no way in hell anyone could have ever 
driven it otherwise.  I see a lot of OG buses running around with
various pieces of rust.  I hope they fix them eventually, so as 
to not jeopardize a larger part of the bus.

There are compromises in everything.  If you want a cool bus, sometimes
you have to put some work in 'em.  Most the OG, low-mileage, original
paint buses in granny's garage went to Hiroshima back in the 80's.

Go ahead, pass on the rusty buses needing work; I'll take 'em.

&gt; parts. Its all about the real deal.
