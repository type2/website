Subject: Heater Pipe question....

Hi Real Bus People    I just crawled out from under
Ol'No Name and I have NO CLUE! Why the heat duct pipe
that goes to the front of the bus from the back on the
drivers side is capped off where the Y is at the end
of the heat tube at the back?..Why would the left side
just not hook into the duct work that runs to the
front?......It hooks up to a joint that looks like the
right side but it does not hook into the duct work
running to the front????? Got a clue?...dont need the
heat but what the heck!!!!
