The reason we're back is our newly-rescued '61Standard. Found her
sitting in a parking garage building in downtown Santiago, where she'd
been since 1973. .....
...............................

sounds like a great bus!!!!!   Do you have any pictures?   It sounds great, 
driving through the mountains and valleys. Thanks for the story  :)

Since it sat for sooo long, do change the oil frequently until it stays clean 
.   I wouldn't be surprised if you needed to change it now, and again in 100 
miles.   
-----
...It got quite cold near the top of the pass and no amount of twisting on
the heater knob would yield anything but ice-cold air.
.......... 
crawl under the back of the bus and look at the heater boxes at their front 
ends.   Are there cables attached to them that go into little tubes that lead 
to the front of the bus?   No?   Hm,, are there cables poking out of little 
tubes that go to the front of the bus?   See if someone turning the heater knob 
gets broken ends of cable to poke out of the little tubes.    Anyway, the 
cables should be present and clamp to the heater boxes, and pull the levers open 
when you turn the knob.   You also need to have fresh air hoses in good shape, 
and the tubes that lead from the heater boxes to the body in place.   Duct tape 
helps over loose connections under there.   Especially as you have 60mm 
diameter  heater tubes on the bus, and the heater boxes might be 80mm.  i've never 
replaced a heater cable yet, but I aim to do that on my 61 soon.  Right now 
the knob opens/ closes the heater box that lets air to the front, but the other 
one is wired open because the cable snapped off on that side.
------------------------------- 
trying to remember whether or not there was such a thing as a steering
lock on a split bus.
..........
some have them.  Rarely did N American spec buses have them, but it seems 
that all splitties sold in Europe did.   
If the key goes into the painted pod the speedo is in, you have no steering 
lock
If it goes into a black (or white) thing under the plate (under the speedo 
pod) you bash your knee on when getting into the bus  it has a steering lock.   
on 66&amp; earlier versions there is writing around the key hole 'lock, garage, 
fahrt, start' or some such.
The steering lock is activated when you remove the key in the lock position.  
merely turning the key to shut the bus off would not lock the steering.
---------------
deal with our fumbling around in the dark (no engine compartment
 lightmake note to install one of those really bright ones like the two
 pair in the cabin) 
................
I installed lights like that in my engine compartment.  I put one on each 
side screwed to the braces on the ceiling.  I used VW inline fuses just in case.  
 The right side on I ran straight from thebattery, the left from the left 
taillight power.  In the engine compartment I use 10W bulbs and no covers.
--------------------
.... The stepped cam had lost it's rolled
 pin and had swung down and back up to lodge under the idle screw.
 Today we fabricated a pin out of a piece of brass wire terminal and
 stuck it in there, 
..............
ya,  I've had that happen too.  I've used a small nail and tapped it in place.
 --------------------------
 Now here is the question: what is the method by which the electric
 choke communicates with the stepped cam? 

..... hot wire from 15 terminal of coil should run over to the tab on the 
choke.   So when you turn on the ignition the coil warms up and relaxes.   To 
adjust the choke, turn off the ignition, let the choke be cold.   Loosen th three 
screws than hold the choke still, and remove the brace, leaving the choke in 
place.   you should be able to turn th choke by hand or with a pair of wide 
mouthed pliers.   If you pull the choke off you'll see how the coil in the choke 
moves a thingy in the carb that flips the top butterfly open/shut.  (have to 
remove tube to air cleaner to see the top butterfly.)  It also turns the step 
on the left side of the carb.  There is a notch on the choke, &amp; mark on the 
carb body that should roughly line up.  I adjust it so it's just at the maximum 
closed with choke cold.   The accelerator arm should rest on a higher step.  
Attach choke brace/screws.   Reconnect everything, turn key on.    As the choke 
warms up, it relaxes and lets the accelerator arm rest on a lower step till 
it should be on the lowest step when its warmed up.    Sometimes you need to 
goose the gas (can do that at the carb) to get it to go to a lower step.  Adjust 
choke as necessary.   Remember, the wire to the choke is hot with ignition on.
-----------------------------------
 Here is another question: the tube which encloses the accel cable in
 it's passage through the tin is loose, and moves back and forth
 together with the cable. The grommet is split, so the rear (RIR) half
 is still on the end of the tube as it moves. What should hold the tube
 in place? The grommet?
...........
Earlier carbs did not have a spring between th top and bottom, there was a 
spring between the metal tube the cable goes through and the accelerator arm 
there.

I take a old piece of fuel line and give it one slice length ways and then 
carve a dent around its middle.  This goes around the tube th accelerator cable 
goes through, and also acts as a grommet through the front tin  (a little 
tricky to wiggle it into place, that's why I carve th groove in around the 
middle).  W/o a grommet eventually the tin cuts through the tube and can cut through 
the cable.    I also use a small hose clamp on the front side of the fan 
housing around th tube, so it can't slide through the fan housing to the back.
