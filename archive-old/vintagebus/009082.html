Subject: what I did on my vacation (long and boreing)

My girlfriend finally talked me into letting her move up here to BC, so as
I'm getting ready to leave for SoCal, I realize that I'll be bored as hell
having done it so many times before and I'll have an empty astro 'cause
there's no engine to build this trip.

So in a burst of inspiration, I figure I'll add to my busma account (God
knows it goes negative enough) and offer to deliver stuff down south. As my
finger hovers over the send key, I think 'nah' no-one will take me up on it
and I'll be safe. Well first a pleasant surprise, Bill N of Portland says
'hey' stop by for breakfast. I check my schedule and the time adds up just
about right. Then Harry of Fresno asks if I'll stop by Clara's in Olympia
and then oldskool asks about Oregon.

Okay, I think no-ones waay off the beaten path and I say ok. Well life
always throws a curve and first the astro which never skips a beat acts like
its gonna blow. Turns out to be just a burned wire, but there goes the
afternoon pretrip nap.

So off to school for the end of flight nav and then off to catch the last
ferry, which for those of you who've never visited BC is 10:45p which means
we hit the mainland just before 1a. Now this being summertime the island is
overrun with tourists which plays hell with the ferry schedule and of course
we're 30min late hitting the mainland. Not normally a problem but I told
Clara I'd be there 5am ish which still gave me time to get to Portland to
breakfast with Bill.

First surprise was not to get searched at the border, (hint) if your dual
citizen don't tell customs, for some reason it pisses em off. Start burning
fuel and it starts to look like I'll get to oly by 5a. Well it actually
turns out to be 4:30 a. Now have you ever pulled into someone's driveway
that you've never met a O dark '30. Lets just say that Clara looked none too
bright eyed. She recovered nicely tho and offered up coffee, pulled up a
chair and talked buses as tho she did this every day. Got to see her very
cool collection, grabbed Harry's part, looked at the watch which said no way
in hell can you reach Portland in time, put it in warp speed and came very
close.

Got to have a very nice breakfast with Bill (hint) buy parts from Bill, he
charges you a fair price and then feels he over charged you, ; ) Actually
was able to find my way back out of Portland and headed off to central
Oregon to find parts for oldschool and got totally lost in small town
Oregon. Phone call set me straight and soon was poking around some pretty
cool Porsches and VW's. I really want that Porsche powered crewcab.

Burned more fuel running at warp speed to get down to Cal to meet Harry,
severely overestimated gas consumption and had to draft a truck to make our
meeting place. (the central valley is awful empty that time of morning)
Glided into the gas pumps to see Harry in his car,unkinked all my body parts
and took on more gas and caffeine. Talked buses for a few minutes with
Harry, who looked awful tired (he'd driven 2hours to meet up and I was at
about 20) was rewarded with some cool microbrew for my efforts and then back
on the road again.
Bus content! got to see Claras bus ranch, saw bunches of bays and vanagens
on the road. Best of all got to meet more bus people and what the hell,
maybe a couple acts of charity put a few more gallons in the busma tank.
If you've read this far, you spend way too much time on your computer.
