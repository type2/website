Subject: More Copyright

Well, here you go:

&quot;Generally, for works created in 1978 or later, a copyright lasts for
fifty years beyond the life of the work's author, after which it lapses
into public domain.  17 U.S.C. 302(a).  If the work is prepared by two
or
more authors (a &quot;joint work&quot;), its copyright lasts for fifty years after

the last surviving author dies.  17 U.S.C. 302(b).  For anonymous and
pseudonymous works, and for works made for hire, copyright exists for
100
years from the date of creation, or 75 years from the date of first
publication, whichever comes first.  17 U.S.C. 302(c).  No renewal is
necessary or permitted.  (The year 1978 in this paragraph is because
January 1, 1978 is the date on which the Copyright Act of 1976 took
effect.)&quot;

Notice the 3rd sentence.  Looks like Thom's got another 28 years to
wait... legally anyway.  If you'd like to see the complete text of this
FAQ I found, you can see it here:

The copyright act of 76 basically got rid of the renewal clause that
used to force copyright holders to renew or loose their copyrights.
Interesting, but just a tad on the dry side.
