Hi Everyone,

My clutch had been slipping every now and then, and the tob had begun
chirping so I decided to repair. I pulled my engine this weekend and
replaced the clutch pressure plate, disc, tob, enigine main seal, axle
boots, hard start relay, plugs, and wires. The old clutch disc was worn to
the metal on one side and the other side was like new, but with some oil
slick on it. The bell housing had a bit of engine oil in it as well... With
all of the above replaced with new parts, I re-installed the engine this
afternoon.  On my test drive, I noticed very little if any play in the
clutch pedal and a bad chattering. Since I had adjusted the clutch to
accomodate for the worn disc a while back, it made since to loosen the
cable. With about 1- 1 1/2 play, I went for another test drive. At take off
in first and reverse, the truck begins to chatter really badly and the rear
wheels kinda hop up and down. I used a clutch alignment tool to set the new
disc, and I tightened the pressure plate the way the Muir book
descibes...going round and round 1/2 turn on each bolt until it maits up
with the flywheel. The tob looked a little different than the old one, but
it is the same size.  I did not grease the new tob... I tried putting the
truck in 2nd setting the hand brake and releasing the clutch. This makes the
engine begin to strain, then level off, then die.
Hmmm that's about all the facts I can think of.... Any suggestions :-)

-Tom
