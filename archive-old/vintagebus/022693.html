I wondered that too.  The red in that pic is the primer, though.

My technique (ok, so I've done it twice) is to do the bottom, and then the
top, and I fine-taped both of them.  Maybe it's a better teqnique to blend
it without taping the first color.

&gt;On a serious note, people who have painted busses chime in.  Paint a two tone
&gt;with or with out front doors for best results??   Why did they extend the
&gt;chestnut brown down into the wax red that far?  Obviously were going to
e-shoot
&gt;the red I guess.  Is it easier to over shoot the top color and then come back
&gt;and fineline tape the swage line??
