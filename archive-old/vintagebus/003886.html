Ok. Figured out that I have seized bearing on #3. Am planning on a complete
bottom end rebuild, so I'm prepared for the worst, and whatever happens
won't be as bad if i was more of an optimist. Anyhow, while I'm in the empty
engine room, and the engine is out, I want to take this time to add some
things. What gauges should definitely be added? I have an oil temp gauge but
something tells me it doesn't work, as I have never saw it move. I read in
the archive (my browser is sending me invalid page faults or I'd be there
now) to add an oil pressure gauge as well, but what else? And how hard are
these to hook up for your average up and coming bus doctor? Also, my gas
gauge doesnt work. Is there a procedure to run, and see if it is either my
sender or the gauge itself? Thanks for any help, and I really hope to be on
the road soon.
