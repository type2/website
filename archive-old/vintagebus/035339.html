Hi David,
You might be able to get some diamond tipped drills used from your local 
dentist.  We had to use these many time in the USAF when someone special in 
the field would use a easy-out to remove a stuck stud or broken bolt.  They 
would break off the easy-out leaving a hardened piece of steel undrillable in 
there and then call us!  Would only take 3 to 4 hours of grinding the remains 
of each easy-out till extraction.   Eric&amp;Barb
