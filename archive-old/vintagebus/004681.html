Clara et al,
 A ute (short for utility) is a particularly Australian bit of work. Smaller
than a pickup, a model based on a car but with a tray integral to the body
rather than the bit with the back seat in. Mythology abounds, country boys
make them flashy and stickers saying &quot;shoot ferals&quot; are placed, they appear
in the city sometimes laden with professional vomiters, do wheelies &amp; donuts
then go home.&quot;Sound familiar? Anything small with a tray is called a ute
here.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; How common is or how many were made of the single cab ute's with no air
vents
&gt; on the side of the vehicle. The over head peak on the cab is alot longer
to
&gt; channel the air to the motor.
&gt;  - -  -  --  -
&gt; 1.   whatsa &quot;ute?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 2. the overhead lip on the cab is passenger ventilation, not motor.
&gt;
&gt; 3.  single cabs have engine vents to let the air in for the motor.
