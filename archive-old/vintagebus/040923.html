Importance: Normal

The Bus Depot is hiring agan!

We have openings for either full or part time, seasonal or permanent.
Position is entry-level (meaning you start in the shipping dept. and work
your way up), as we promote from within.  On the other hand there's
definately plenty of potential for advancement; we're a small company so
every employee is an important part of the whole.  Hours are weekdays 11-7
(if full-time); weekends off. No experience is neccessary. We're
conveniently located smack in the middle of nowhere - in rural Montgomery
County, Pa.,  about 30-45 miles from Philadelphia, Reading, or Allentown.

Please p-mail me if interested, or pass this along if you know someone who
may be interested.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
The Bus Depot, Inc.
