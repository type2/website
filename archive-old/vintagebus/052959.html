Subject: Re: [VB] 28 PCI

My understanding is that the venturi is the narrowest part of the
&quot;throat&quot; of the carb. The number is the diameter of the narrowest
part. On my 30/31 PICT it is cast as part of the carb, not something
that can be readily changed, not quite like a jet. Too small a venturi
may work ok at low speeds, but will probably limit your top speed by a
bit. Not enough air/fuel mix can get past that restriction to really
feed the engine properly at higher rpms. It would be like having one
of those speed limiting &quot;governors&quot; on your intake.
 I believe I once heard that a manual choke carb is still in
production in Brazil or maybe Mexico, don't know any specs but maybe
that is more suited to your needs?
I think the jets you describe in your post are first the mains jet
(behind the plug) and second the air correction jet (look down on it
with the top off the carb).

Could I put a 22.5 venturi in the PCI?  I really would like to make
the PCI
work - I like the idea of a manual choke and my 60 has a knob for the
manual
choke. So on the PCI the jet that is on the back side of the plug at
the
bottom of the bowl that is the jet I'd have to change. And on the
ventuiri -
the jet that I see when looking down into the assembled carb would
have to
be changed - right?  Those are what need to be larger right?

&gt; Hi Jdd,
&gt; The 28PCI with it's 21.5 venturi would be way too small for a 40HP
&gt; 1200-1400cc engine.  Best to work with the 28PICT or a 28PICT-1 carb
with
&gt; thier 22.5 venturi for it.  Eric&amp;Barb
