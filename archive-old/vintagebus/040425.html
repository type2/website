Instead of wishing things weren't, accept things
the way they are.  Although you would have never
done such a mod yourself, you can accept it for
what it is and run with it.  If it is basically
sound structurally, go with the flow and restore
it to what it was, a shorty custom bus.  By building
on what it has become and forgeting what it started
out as you can have a lot of fun.  Dress that bus
to the hilt, keep the dress-up to match what was
or what would have been done at the shortening.

Let it live as an example of what happens to those
way cool/kewl mods after time has passed.  What
was cool, is just old now.

Take it to shows and include a sign that says to
the effect:
&quot;If I had been left stock, I would be a classic now,
 I'm just an goofy looking old custom bus now&quot;

This is what I wanted to do with my '66 root beer
brown, red shag, dark wood interior, cutout wheel
wells, big back tire bus, but alas I sold it first.
