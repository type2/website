&lt;&lt; I forgot to include in my post that I applied primer to the inside of my
bus, before I applied the rubberized undercoat. I thought about using tar
paper, but I found this
 process better.&gt;&gt;
     Was that a high content zinc primer?  Normal primer is just a material
that sticks to metal and paint that does not stick to metal well sticks to the
primer instead.  Almost all of these normal primers are by themselfs not water
proof and only a month later can have rust showing through.

&lt;&lt; It's been about 2 years and no rust no fuss. I guess if you take care of
the
 rust before you apply any rustproofing preventitive measures you'll be better
off. &gt;&gt;
         That is definitely a must, but you probably did not dip the whole
body of the bus in this primer.  Plus since the factory did not do this also
there is bare metal behind each and everyone of those braces that hold the
outer sheet metal from flexing.  This is also why the rockers and doglegs in
these buses rust out so fast.  So any moisture held by insulation against the
outersheet metal can drip into these bare metal areas and start the rust crawl
under the rubberized undercoating. 
  Had a simular problem happen to a friend of ours.  He restored a bus which
had some damage to the drivers door.  He cleaned, sand blasted, body worked,
and painted the door.  Only to have a couple of years later the rust that he
had not been able to get out of between the door skin and the brace behind it
to rust through the outer skin.  It looked sad this nicely restored bus with a
rusty area on it's door.
