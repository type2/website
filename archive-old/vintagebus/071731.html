Subject: [T2] Wheel balancing in CT?


&gt; Has anyone been able to find a tire shop in CT to balance old style 5 
&gt; lug wheels?  I've been calling around all afternoon, and the closest 
&gt; I've gotten is Town fair tire saying their warehouse truck tire place 
&gt; can balance any rim with at least three holes, but I'd have to buy my 
&gt; tires there. (tires are already bought)  Even the old timer place near 
&gt; my house said they hadn't used their adapter in years, and think they 
&gt; got rid of it.


Bolt the rim to a front brake drum.
