Subject: Re: [VB] RE: '62 Westy for sale CAVEOT EMPTOR

I advertised a '66 for a set amount and found a buyer.
He kept promising to pick it up, week after week. Finally
I realized that I wanted to keep the bus, so I set a hard 
and fast deadline date, otherwise the deal was off, hoping
that he'd flake, and I would keep the bus.

He made the deadline by a few hours, and I still regret 
selling the bus, but as others have said, a deal is a deal,
so it went away.

Jeff

&gt;&gt; For all the points that might be made either way, the thing that
&gt;&gt; bothers me is that a deal is a deal, and if I agreed to sell for a
&gt;&gt; price and someone came along and told me I could have done better, I
&gt;&gt; would still have to say I made a deal and honor it.
