Finally, the '59 15 Window rolled up last night around 9:00.  Jim Shain of Shart Transports (the fellow Ronnie F. recommended to the list several times, THANKS RONNIE) transported the bus for me from Hiawatha, Kansas.  This is the bus that Erin Lassely (THANKS ERIN) posted to the list back in June.  If anyone needs a transport company call Jim at Shart (800)556-0059.  He's a super guy, honest and affordable.

Anyway, the bus is awesome.  Not showroom awesome, but complete and no rust/dents awesome.  The rockers are perfect, rear corners are perfect, frame is perfect, front nose is perfect, a few small holes in the floorpans but easy patch stuff.  All the interior panels are there including the chrome trim, middle seat, there, rear seat, there.  Corner glass is good, jailbars are there, even the original blockoff plate is there.  As far as I can tell the bus has never been hit. 

The entire inside is covered in what looks to be 4 years of dust, and given the fact that I did my initial inspection with a penlight flashlight at 10:30 pm I'm sure some not so pretty truths will show up today when I really go over the thing.  I did check out the exterior this morning before shoveling off to work and was really pleased with the way things look.

The interior (dash, misc) is sealing wax red so I'm assuming the original colors were SWR and Beige Grey.  Whether that is true or not those are the colors that I'm going to go with whenever the day comes for paint, 2002 maybe.  It also came with a bunch of extra parts, redux boxes, 6 pop-outs with the BIG spoon latches, 2 complete front window frames, front emblem, etc.

Not bad for $500.00.  No engine, tho.  More to follow.

Robert
