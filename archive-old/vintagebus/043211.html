Better to leave the lower coats on the car if possible, as they were baked
on by the factory and you'll not get that kind of adhesion again.

Use a three part epoxy sealer over a good primer, both obtained at a good
auto-body-supply store. Then apply your top coat. If you go down to the
metal, the primer should be a self-etching primer, and treat the bared
metal with the metal-prep liquid first, also avialable at the supply
store. If you can get the Dupont 625/625s zinc-dichromate primer (two
part), it will last forever, if it's applied over the bare metal
correctly.

Don't forget to treat the other side of the metal properly too. POR15
works well when applied correctly.

Of course, you could strip the car down, and get it acid-dipped and
galvanized!
