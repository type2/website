Well , who was at Buses by the Balloons 99?
There was 6 double door buses there, I didn't keep track of the Kombi /
standard  arrangement
a couple were campers
there was also 6 double cab buses there tooo..
When the first Double door drove in,,,, Gert Mentioned to my DAD that The
double door buses and the double cabs are pretty rare,,,,,, so when he saw
the second one , he started to keep track
I guess that they wern't walk thru's though,,, the campers had the kitchen
right in the way.

I'll keep better track next time
Later

&gt;&gt;Then how rare is a splitty double door standard or kombi ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I've personally seen 1 DD Kombi, heard of/seen 2 DD Standards, and 5 or 6
&gt;Deluxes.

&gt;Since &quot;rare&quot; is abused, they may not be &quot;rare&quot; but they are definitely
&gt;scarce and highly desirable, IMHO.
