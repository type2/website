I agree with George, as long as the oil has the proper API rating it should
be fine.

In my opinion you could run the worst oil on the shelf and run fine as long
as the oil was changed every 3000 miles...  3000 miles should not come close
to breaking down the oil to the point of failure....  Unless your engine
runs waaaay too hot and then all bets are off.  As long as you stay around
or below 210 degrees you are fine.  Anything over 220 and I would seek more
aggressive cooling methods.

Just as reference, the Porsche 911 owners go nuts if they run over 210 and
claim that this is the magic number for long engine life.  I am using this
number to compare my air-cooled motor to just because it seems logical that
the laws of physics are the same for both.  Also the Porsche recommends oil
changes at 10,000 miles with regular dino juice!  Granted the newer 911s now
see factory synthetic Mobil1 15W-50 (as does mine now).

I run a full-flow oil system so if I see a need for an extra cooler this
will not be a problem to add on (with an oil control thermostat of course).
If you have a stock pump you can go full-flow with a CB Performance Maxi
Pump 3 very easily (provide you can get the stock pump out - the two screw
driver trick I cannot ever get to work).  Very effective and does not cry
around edges!  Many people complain about them leaking, but I wonder which
exact product it was and how well the seating surface was to begin with.  

Good Luck!
