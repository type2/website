 &gt; So then it would be safe to assume that a Kombi would fall under, which
 &gt; class?  I guess it's a commercial bus, afterall it has the black vent
 &gt; latches.  But it was destined as a passenger bus on it's way to the
 &gt; Westfalia factory to get dressed up.  ???
 
 Ahh, but you have an early Westy (at least earlier than the SO42/44  series
 I'm familiar with) .  Weren't those based on standards?  You know two tone
 paint and all.
 
 But I could be full of it for all I know.

my 59 westy was originally two two SWR/BG, it is a type 23 (kombi)  haven't 
checked to see what kind of glass (its piled in the back anyway)  but it has 
that SK paint code- as two tone was a Special Kolour

my 65 westy is OG two tone, also type 23, kombi,  sekurit glass
