Sean,
Glad that one of my customers could answer that question..

Our engines are configured to work togheter, even stock ones...everything
related to a VW engine will have a thermal reaction, be it hot or cold....A
cool running engine is in tune, and it is equally configured...

BTW That litle 100MPH race was with my test car and a 1600 engine(at the
time)....Only my cars run better than my customers...But lately I have not
had time to tweek on anythingt but customers engines...

&gt; Chris,
&gt;
&gt; Aside from the Type 1 and Type 4 engines I've purchased from Jake, I know
&gt; several other people who have gone through Raby's VW as well. I recently
&gt; traded the car away that has a Type 1 (1776) in it from Jake, and after
2.5
&gt; years, several thousand miles, and many 4-grand
front-tire-lifting-launches
&gt; the car is still going very strong.
&gt;
&gt; The most amazing thing about his engines is how cool they run. I picked up
&gt; my 72 Camper (with a fresh engine) this past Tuesday night and drove it
over
&gt; 100 miles home without fail. When I pulled in the driveway, I went around
&gt; back and put my hand all over the engine with no fear of getting burned
&gt; (kids don't try this at home). It sounds un-orthodox, but that is one of
the
&gt; ways he'll have you check to make sure it's running right. My wife and I
did
&gt; the 1999 Hippie Days run in our bug with the 1776 with only 1200 miles on
&gt; the engine, by the time we got home we had racked up over 700 extra
miles -
&gt; hit over 100 mph (racing Jake) and never once had any troubles. Everytime
we
&gt; stopped for gas or directions people would come over and look at the
engine
&gt; and want to touch it. No one could believe that it was running that cool.
&gt;
&gt; Sure, this may sound a little biased, but that's only because in the 11
&gt; years I've been in the VW world, I have been rooked by almost every
crooked
&gt; or sorry VW mechanic in the state of GA. Jake's attention to detail and
&gt; strong belief in customer service are the reasons this sounds so flowery -
&gt; other than well-deserved grattitude, I don't owe him anything.
&gt;
&gt; If you'd like to talk some more about this, feel free to send me a pmail.

&gt; Oh yeah - most everything he builds comes with a warranty that he actually
&gt; stands by!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would be interested to hear from anyone that has purchased a type 1
&gt; &gt;motor from Jake Raby at
&gt; &gt;http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/Home_Page.htm .  I am in shopping
&gt; &gt;for an engine builder and am intrigued by Jake's take on building
&gt; &gt;motors. Jake took the time out the answer a lot of sophomoric
&gt; &gt;questions from me which I appreciate!!!!!! Since I do not currently
&gt; &gt;know anyone that has purchased a motor from  him I was hoping there
&gt; &gt;would be a few listmembers out there that have who could share there
&gt; &gt;experiences with me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks
&gt; &gt;Chris
