Subject: SO23 Westfalia Curtain Elastic Cords

Hi!

I have managed to get the elastic cord used on the curtain elastics on the 
SO23 Westfalia interior reproduced.

The diameter and weave is a perfect match, and the color match is superb.

This is your chance to obtain some of this cord and replace the faded / 
perished / missing cords in your westy.

I can supply the cord as is or complete with exact copies of the original 
brass fixings.

Pricing is dependant on the amount of cord produced.  The more interest in 
the cord the less it will cost per van.  I will not be getting any more cord 
made after this production run.  This is your one time chance to acquire the 
correct cord which will last for years.

Potential buyers must commit or the production run will NOT be made.

If you have any interest or questions about these cords please email me at 
so23westfalia_at_hotmail_dot_com

Initial samples compared to a faded original pictures are here for you to 
see.

Check my ad on VWPlanet for the pics:

Payment can be accepted in US$ and by paypal.  Worldwide shipping by Air 
will be very cheap.

Best regards

Alex
