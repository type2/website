Subject: bus electrical probs.



My brake lights don't work. where do I start? i do have a wiring diagram 
from tom's site, seems that all the wires are hooked up correctly. now what? 
is it in the master cylinder? sure don't want to have to buy another one of 
those. Also, my turn signals blink very fast. Everynow and then it will 
blink at the proper speed, but not very often. wonder what is wrong there?  
I want to be able to hook my radio up so it will come on when the switch 
comes on, and also when i camp i'd like another way to flip it on. I was 
wondering if i just ran a hot wire up and put a switch on it, so i could use 
it when i want, will the wire that goes back to the ignition coil be hot 
when i flip the switch? I know that sounds confusing, but i did find a wire 
on my 67 that turns hot when the key is on. so i used it for my accesory. 
but if i put another hot wire up from the battey and put a switch inline, 
when this wire is hot, it will also be sending current to the accesory wire 
which defeats the purpose correct?
sorry for all the danm questions. i'm trying to figure out this vw.
peace
B
