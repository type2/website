Subject: Infrared Powder Coating?

I asked the only guy here in Marysville what size oven he has and he said he 
dont, He used infrared.  He does everything up to car chassis with it. Does 
anyone know if this is as good?  My guess is melting the stuff is melting 
the stuff.  I am going to do the crewcab engine tin as well as the 36hp tin 
at about $10 a piece he said.  I also took the opportunity to ask him if he 
could do wheels since someone on the list said you cant cause the 400 
degrees makes you loose the temper...  He said he does wheels all the time 
.. $25 each.

He also said to bring in bare metal, no zinc coating.  Sound right?

I asked him about doing the muffler in powder coat and he suggested Jett 
Hott coating due to the 400 degree break.  But I guess this only comes in 
silver/aluminum color.  I have an original 36hp Abarth, and I think they 
were originally flat black so thats a no go.  TIA
