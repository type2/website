Subject: RE: [VB] Voltage regulator...

I put a volt meter on it tonight and it stays at around 14v in idle. It
goes up some when I rev it up but not a lot. Should it be putting out
14v at idle? Wont that cause the batt to overcharge?

Measure the voltage at the battery terminals with the engine at over
2500
RPM.  It should be between 12.5 and 14V.

&gt; I think mine is overcharging my battery but Im not sure how to test
it.
&gt; It a 1600cc with a GEN. The reason Im suspicious is the mystery water
&gt; under the battery after the bus is on for a while. It was a LOT of
&gt; liquid but the battery isn't low on water. I figured I would ask the
all
&gt; knowing list if there was a quick check to be done for the regulator.
&gt; Also, is the general consensus of the list that a 6V gas gauge will
work
&gt; in a 12V system?
&gt; Thanks as always!
