&lt;&lt; Is this a wise choice - would anyone know if the earlier type
 is the better of the two in terms of performance and reliability?  Who
 is the OEM for these pressure plates for VW? &gt;&gt;
Hi Aircooledvw,
We and our friends have had nothing but trouble with the diaphram type 
clutches in pre-1968 buses.  The 200mm nine sping pressure plates with 
matching sized spring centered clutch discs have worked great for us.  Both 
of these we get form Sach of Brazil.    Eric&amp;Barb
