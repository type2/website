I just picked up a radio for my 67 bus.  The radio works fine, but it does
not line up with the main hole.  There is about an 1/8 of an inch gap between
the top and bottom.  It only has 1 plate between the radio and dash.  Am I
missing another spacer plate?  This is a saphire radio with chrome push
buttons.
Thanks
