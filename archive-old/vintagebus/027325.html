FWIW, I was driving my dad's &quot;full size&quot; Ford this afternoon. (F-350 dually)
and backed over a 4x4 and didn't even feel it.  It's likely the the &quot;fine
agrarian gentleman&quot; (read: redneck) who backed into your bus didn't even
realize it.

Sorry...

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; The other night I went over to a friends place to play some roller hockey
&gt; and parallel parked behind a full-size C#*%y pick-up, and went I came out
&gt; to my bus to leave, the truck was gone and there was a *huge* dent in the
&gt; front of my bus!!!  I was fuming because the SOB didn't even leave a
&gt; note!  So I've been searching the town of Moscow, ID for a white/blue '90s
&gt; pick-up so I can get the license plate #.  Point of this story:  there are
&gt; a lot of idiot red-necks driving big 4x4 trucks that just don't give a
&gt; damn what they run into!  Watch out.
