Okay, I'm obsessed, but that's a Friday topic, so I'll stick to the bare
mechanicals here..

1.    I dislike strange noises

2. this rythmic thunking while cruising in neutral bothered me.    Happens
consistantly when warmed up, inconsistantly when cool.   Engine on/off doesn't
matter.    Seems to be gettings louder.   I had heard a couple brief shrieks,
too, just recently.  

3.  it was extra annoying that is was unidentified.   Is this indicating
something that will leave me stranded, or just a noise?   Didn't sound like
-just- a noise though.

4. I had talked to several people and bugged them about this noise, but still
no satisfactory ideas.

So I went to my bookshelf and started reading on axles.  I double checked the
specs for the play for the fulcrum plates/crown gear/axle shafts, and found
two different sets of numbers.   Reading further, I learned that until some
time in 59 (late58?), but before the split case tran was discontined in the
type 2, the fulcrum plates were a different style.  I had not realised this
before, as I had only looked at the 63 edition book, not the 59 edition, which
has earlier stuff in it.   The fulcrum plates are flat on one side and curved
on the other, so if you look at it from one end the cross section is kinda
like    this    -&gt;    |)
  ( the plates are i guess about 1&quot; by 2 1/2&quot; by a quarter inch thick- rough
estimate here)  )  The later style if you hold it round side down on a flat
surface, you can rock it end to end, while the early style you can't.   I
think about .2mm   rockability.   And thus the different play specs.  The
later style can be installed in earlier trans, but the play can be less that
the earlier FPs.

Also read various other things,   and etc etc.     Wandered out to the garage
and looked in my bag of used fulcrum plates.  I had 2 early ones and 4 late
ones.   All 4 in my tranny had been replaced.      But the axle shafts, tubes,
and reduction gears were all ones I had used before, and were quiet.    More
talking about noises,  and at about 10.30 I decided I had to tear it apart.
I started at 11:00pm Tues and had  the transaxle was stripped of brakes, even
backing plates,  and on the garage floor by 1:30am Wed,  and wasn't even
rushing.   Damn I'm good.
   Pulled the reduction gear boxes apart and axle tubes off, carefully marking
what came from where, and wrapping things in rags to keep crud from getting in
where it shouldn't.

   The right hand axle shaft I pulled off first, and pulled out the crown gear
with its two  fulcrum plates.  Examined the gear for cracks, but didn't see
any.  Puling out the fulcrum plates I found a chunk o metal.  I could fit it
into a fulcrum plate (FP), like a jigsaw puzzle.  This aint good.      Okay,
the fulcrum plate is getting eaten.   Hm...   Yes, one is late and one early-
I don't think that is right.  This axle thinks it's Animal from the Muppets
and eats its plates.   Definately I'm tired.

Pulled the left side off, the crown gear looked okay,  the fulcrum plates
looked like a couple small pieces had recently been broken off, and again one
was early and one late.

Looked at the axles, and found they were the earlier style axles, that don't
have the ball on spring to  keep them from moving that way.  (think that was
late 60 and earlier thing.  like you all care.   Well, I care.)

Okay- so I will never but never think that just cause it's a 65 bus what's in
the tranny is 65 stuff.  It came to me with a 67 center section with a 33/8
ring and pinion with a backup light nose cone, Big nut axles with one
obviously rebuildt reduction gear box, 60 or earlier axles, early 59 and back
fulcrum plates.   

I am not assuming that there is not something else going on.   Just that
fulcrum plate set up seems not so good does not exclude other factors.

Well, I should have pulled it out earlier.   I put 150 miles on it.    I
should trust my instincts better.  It was 2.30 now, and I left the garage and
washed my hands.   Hey- check it out- if you bus is clean you can pull a
tranny out and have a little oil and dirt on your hands - that's about it.    

Please-   I am just showing off here saying how quick it took me.    I have
pulled it apart before, and cleaned and greased everything.    If you are
pulling a tranny, plan all day for it, just in case.         Crudded bolts etc
take time.   Sliminess makes things take longer and longer clean up time.

Anyway, the motor started leaking a ton from the main seal or something, and
the clutch was slipping .  

 well, geeses  .
