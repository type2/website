Hi Mark,
It sounds like you either need to adjust the clutch cable to give you the
proper amount of play in the clutch pedal, or your clutch disc has been oil
soaked.  If the clutch adjustment does not do the trick then you need to
remove the engine and check to see if the clutch disc is oil soaked and then
either replace the engine/flywheel seal and/or the tranny/input shaft seal.
Then either replace your clutch disc or use a cleaner to remove the oil from
it.  If the disc is not oilly then check your needle bearing in the center of
the flywheel that the rear end of the input shaft rides in.  If you do not
apply a little coating of grease to the rear end of the input shaft so when
it is slid inside the needle bearing in the flywheel when reinstalling the
engine, then you will risk having the needle bearing going bad due to lack of
lubricant.  Allowing the rear end of the clutch input shaft and the clutch
disc riding on it to wobble and not completely dissengage from the flywheel
due to the clutch disc being tilted into the flywheel.  Resulting in troubles
with shifting.
