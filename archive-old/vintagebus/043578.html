&gt;Am also looking for the Haynes manual to add to my Muir ('79 edition 
&gt;with spiral bound) and Bentley as well as numerous Archive articles
&gt;printed off.

Up here, AutoZone sells all the Haynes manuals and I think they still
stock the late-70s Bus one.  If you get into the fuel system much,
another good manual might be the Bosch fuel injection manual by
Charles Probst from Bentley.  I don't have this book, but another
of his books on Ford fuel injection is very good.  Another good thing
to do is start collecting catalogs.  They often have photos or line
drawings, and you can also compare prices to what you can get locally.

&gt;Right now my main problem is identifying all the 
&gt;components on the engine.  This engine is not like the one in the Muir

It's not like the one in the drawings in the Muir, but he does have
a pretty good explanation at the beginning of the &quot;engine stops or
won't start&quot; chapter - &quot;the picture you want is your very own engine&quot;
as he puts it.  The picture in the Muir book shows the Type I (Bug)
&quot;upright&quot; engine, named for that big fan shroud in the background.
The crankcase, cylinder heads, pistons, etc, of your Type IV engine
are very similar to the Type I, they are just a little bigger and
stronger.  The main visual difference with your engine will be that
the fan and fan shroud are in back (front is front) of the engine
instead of sitting on top, and the alternator is off to one side
instead of on top.
 
&gt;I look forward to driving the bus to a future show so thanks for
&gt;the advice and I will ask for more pretty soon I'm sure.

No problem!
