Subject: Bus startin' woes

So ... I was out trying to start up my bus again - really got to get it into
the driveway before there is snow in the back yard.

Anyway - I went partially through the Muir procedure for a vw that won't start
and got to the point at which I tested my coil - I wasn't getting any spark
from the coil - so I figured that must be the problem and went into town to
crappy tire to get a new coil - put it on and ... damn - still no spark coming
from the coil - OK - sure it is possible that the new coil could be bad - but
that's unlikely - assuming that the coil is good - why wouldn't I get spark if
the key is turned on and there is power to it (at the +15 connection).  What I
did was turn the key on and pull out the centre wire from the dist. and turned
the motor over by hand while holding the centre wire from the coil very close
to a ground.

TIA
