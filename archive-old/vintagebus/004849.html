Hi NQ,

        If you have no luck finding one ,I do have a stack ( about 25)of
them.
I did pay $6 a piece and would sell some to anybody who wants one for the
$6.Let me know if I can help.I have used these and they are a perfect fit.I
do not know the size or part # or I would be happy to share it with you.
            Good Luck!

&gt; I just got back from referencing this number at my 2 FLAPS.  Autozone
&gt; couldn't find it - all their computers say is NLA.  The other store -
&gt; Champion Auto are pretty awesome.  They don't always have the best prices
&gt; but they are a smaller, local chain but they've got the &quot;smart&quot; guys.
They
&gt; measure seals, reference all kinds of stuff with &quot;guess and by golly&quot;
&gt; reckoning and usually can help me out.  They were having trouble with this
&gt; number/seal tonight but they're going to call one of their sources and get
&gt; me the seal.  I was wondering though - since it's such a pain to order
&gt; these, is there anyone that can get ahold of one for me?  Sometimes this
&gt; local FLAPS takes awhile to get parts in so if there is anyone out there
&gt; with an output shaft seal for a bus steering box, I'd appreciate having a
&gt; chance to buy it off from you.  I'm going to need this seal very shortly
(as
&gt; in the middle of next week at the latest) so I'm willing to pay for 2nd
day
&gt; priority though the post office to get it.  How about it P &amp; C - are you
&gt; able to help?
&gt;
&gt; Later!
