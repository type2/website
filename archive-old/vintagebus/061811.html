Better yet, ask these people

I always prefer an unbiased opinion!

&gt; You need to ask the people that will sell you the Valu-Pro paint these questions.

&gt; 
&gt; My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?  I have some CIL acrylic enamel primer surfacer that I
&gt; plan on using.  I had that around for a while but I don't have the reducer for it.  Should my
&gt; valu-pro reducer work for that CIL stuff as well - both are acrylic enamel. The valu-pro paint is
&gt; ICI or PPG?  This stuff is Acrylic Enamel and I hear that is a very good choice for someone who has
&gt; never painted before.
