As all who have followed our quest for lower temp with trying all fixes including
all sheet metal plugging every hole to type IV cooler with 35 mm fan and the 2.2
generator pulley ratio etc. etc. ???very stock DR 1600 SP motor
This is a thought--- but how do we check which exchangers we have, the cooling
fins are inside the external coverings???? not visible
NOW this time of year and temp we don't have a problem but this temp can't e held
for the summer of 2001

&gt;   How ever it happens we do know for a fact that with the fresh air tubes
&gt; sealed off the oil temperature will automaticly rise 20-30F!  Also that
&gt; cheapy Dansk heat c with no internal ribbing (Also almost all small
&gt; forward snouted fresh air heat exchangers made during the latter half of 1963
&gt; and very early 1964 also have no internal cooling fins!) cause the same oil
&gt; temp problems if used on engines bigger than 1200cc.   Eric&amp;Barb
