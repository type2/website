&gt;I recently bought a working 67 deluxe radio, it comes with this transistor
&gt;and two wires going to it. where did this mount at?

Radios were a dealer installed item so it could have gone anywhere.

&gt;The transistor part of my radio is bad, but if I by pass this part, the
&gt;radio works,

Hmm.  The separate box with a &quot;transistor&quot; on it is either an external
amplifier, a high voltage power supply for tubes (not too likely in a
'67 but possible), or a voltage regulator to let a 6 V radio run on a
12 V system.  Only if it's a voltage regulator will bypassing it appear
to work.

&gt;I was told that all i had to do was buy a 1 dollar transistor
&gt;and solder it in....Anybody know where I could get one of these??

There is probably more than just the transistor in that external box.
Ideally you would actually troubleshoot the problem to isolate the
bad part.  If you just want to try swapping the transistor, you have
to know either the part number or the polarity and approximate current
and voltage ratings so you can select a replacement.  Having said
all that, a 2N3055 (NPN) or an MJE34 (PNP) from Radio Shack might
work.  Or it might blow up your radio.

&gt;Is the dash grab handle the same as the partition grab handle??

Per the '67 parts manual at http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ ,
they are the same.

&gt;Where can I get a very nice wiring diagram??  [...]  I seen the one on
&gt;www.vintagebus_dot_com but when i go to print it out i get lots of funny
&gt;pages that don't match up.

There are black and white ones in the repro Bentleys.  If you want one
in color, you have to get an original Bentley -- that's what most of
the diagrams on vintagebus_dot_com are scanned from.  The diagrams on
vintagebus_dot_com should work.  I printed the one for my '64 on a color
printer and it worked just fine.  Please read the stuff at the top of
the wiring diagram page; trying to print the diagram from your Web
browser is likely to be a disaster.
