Bob,

No bondo.  It will develop a crack around the edge of the hole in short order
and eventually fall out.  I had a similiar problem on a Mini Cooper that I
restored a few years back and found that brazing them up was the easiest
solution.  The heat effect zone is a bit larger that with a mig, but there's
less of it (heat) and consequently, not much distortion.  After brazing, press
a wet rag against it and it'll shrink back to about where it should be. Grind
or file off the excess to contour.  I ended up using NO filler on most of the
repairs and still had a good finish.

As always, YMMV.
