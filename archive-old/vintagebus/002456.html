 Thanks Jim on your recommendation to get your camping buddy 'Rubber Johnny' 
to help me out with the bees.  I'll have to pass on it though, I don't want a couple of 
stoned queens in my Westy.  The neighbors hide from me as it is what with me doing
the &quot;Clara Grease Chant&quot; now and then, ( kind of a ZEN moment! ).
  Bus content: new tires installed w/hub caps, door glass installed, front door handles
installed, bought a new battery to start digging into the electric's, more to come!
Grease-Grease-Grease!!!
  I'll just drop the bees off along the highway after the holidays, around mid-January.
    Thanks all for the suggestions!
      Lou in Havasu
