Here is my question. I've heard of folks putting SuperBeetle 4th gears
in thier tranny, for the highway. I've also heard that you can put a
beetle tranny in a splitty, if you flip the ring and pinion. Why not
just put a SB tranny in the bus?

bug 4ths (.89) are slower than bus 4ths (.82) which is why it is nicer to  
have a bus 4th in a bus.   I am not sure, but isn't that still true with the 
sb.  too lazy to look it up tonight.

if you mean  a 3.88 r&amp;p (used april of 72 on) by sb trans,  they have one 
side plate and you cannot put swing axles on them.    you can pull an irs bug 
tranny out from a pre april 72 bug, flip the ring gear (the pinion is un 
touched) put swing axles with RGBoxes on it, and have bug gearing, with the 
.89 4th.   slower than the bus 4th.   which defeats the purpose of freeway 
cruising, but will work in a pinch if you just want a tranny,  dont want to 
or can't fork over for a rebuild,  and have a bad one in there, but a good 
bug tranny kicking around.
