I'll step up here because this is a subject I have some knowledge of.

&gt; BE CAREFUL, heating and quenching (with water) tempers steel and has a
&gt; tendency to make it brittle, from my understanding the shock bolts are
&gt; allready heat treated and heating hardened steel is a no no.

True except for the terminology. Heating a hardened or hardenable steel and
then quenching it with water will cause it to become so hard that it becomes
brittle. For this to take place, the steel must be heated above 1650 deg. F
(depending on the alloy), which is glowing cherry red. Heating below that
temperature, regardless of quenching, will cause hardened steel to become
softer. None of this has any real effect on low carbon steel (also called
mild steel or black iron). Only components with critical strength
requirements are made from anything other than low carbon steel. Trailing
arms, torsion leaves and torsion bars are examples of the types of parts
that are made from higher carbon content or alloy steels such as 4140.
Tempering is actually the process of heating a part which has been hardened
to reduce the hardness and brittleness.

 Ive seen VW
&gt; trailing arms snap in half after gussets were welded on and the part was
&gt; quenched with water to cool, it's best to let it cool natureally or use
&gt; quenching oil.

True. Actually, because the surrounding metal is still cold (relatively)
when arc welding, it will soak up the heat from a weld fast enough to behave
like a quench. If I were welding on a trailing arm or any other high carbon
or alloy steel component, I would anneal the weld area with an oxy-acetylene
torch immediately after welding to prevent the weld affected area from
becoming brittle. Annealing is the process of heating the steel above the
recrystallization temperature (1650 deg. F) and then allowing it to cool
slowly.

This is a very short treatment of the nature of steel. It is a very complex
subject and material.
I'll be glad to answer any questions that I can.
