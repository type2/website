Good point. Don't use the sound barrier here but &quot;mass load&quot; with
dynamat.

&lt;I looked at the heater jacket photo of inside your door-is is
waterproof? 
water travels through your door every time it rains....&gt;

IMHO, McMaster is too high end industrial. Very expensive too. The cheap
roofing KOOLPATCH and ICEGUARD are cheap and work very well. Read the
http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/ page to understand Mass loading
and the difference between sound dampening and Sound absorption. 

Anyone want to help me do this peel and stick task?
