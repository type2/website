&lt;&lt; All the puck
 owners replied they are worth bazillions!!....That is
 a biased opinion i figure and thru in my 2
 cents...(weather you like my post of not is not that
 what this list is about?!)  
 
 Any how, the little pucks were worth about $800-$1500
 before Jim bought flaunted about and it was stuck in
 BIG VW mags.  As we know ANYTHING that hits the mags
 is instantly worth quadruple its actual value.  Thanks &gt;&gt;

Actually as a puck owner, I replied that I paid $500 for mine, which is no 
where near a bazillion. As for actual value, ANYTIHNG is worth whatever 
someone will pay for it. My 56 deluxe is another eyesore in the yard to my 
neighbors, and not worth the space it takes up. And worth probably a couple 
hundred in scrap. But I could sell it for 10gs by noon easy. As for them 
being cheap in germany, you can get twice the cash for alot of things in LA 
that you can get for them in oregon. Oregon is not nearly as far to go or as 
complicated to get a vehicle from as Germany, but still no droves of people 
driving up to buy things. So you see, its all relative. And when it comes 
down to it, whatever it is, it's worth whatever someone will pay.
