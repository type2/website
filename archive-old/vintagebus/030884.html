Hy Guys

I hope all of you have been passing good times enjoying yours vintage buses, by now I just 
have a 65 deluxe sedan that I am in the final touches of the not professional but very 
passioned process of restoration.
In this period of time I have meet many people that encorage me to finish my project and 
take me to the stage of been beated by the bug, so I am in now.
I was buying some parts last week when a guy with a single cab arrive to the shop after a 
while I decide to start a conversation with him in order to see the bus, because the bus has a 
very very strange cargo comparment, the thing is somethin like the canvas cover that you 
can find in a Single Cab but is made of aluminiun with folding gates at both side of the bus, 
the guy said to me tha this cargo comparment has a VW number on it but I could no see it 
becase the truck was loaded at the moment.
After a little talk he aggred to gave me a ride and in the process I ask him if he wants to sale 
the bus and I lloking for some info in order to buy it or not.
I live in Venezuela and maybe thats why the bus is dating 64 in the identification papers but 
still have bullets front turn signals.
I found this numbers in the plate behing the passegers seat

02 05 3

363 056 085 121 176

VIN # 1064539

As far as I know the bus is a 1963 SC but my quiestion is 

It is possible that in  1964 the buses still have bulleths front turn ligths and what kind of stop 
ligths correspond to this bus and if a rear bumper of a1970 could be acomodate in this bus, 
since tha actual owner change the stop ligths with a bay windows stop ligths and the rear 
bumper is home made.

Thanks
