To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

On my 6v bus I am trying to hook up a third brake
light (no, that is not the stupid part(maybe)).  When
I connect the third light wire to 1 of the original
lights, all three brake lights go out. When I
disconnect the wire the std two brake lights work fine
again.

Does this mean I have a grounding problem on the third
light?  Or am I just trying to draw too much juice?

Thanks
