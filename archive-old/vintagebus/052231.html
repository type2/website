Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

I think the fastest I have gone is 75ish on the speedo.  Waaaay too fast for
a bus to go in stock form from a safety standpoint.  Personally I think
anything over 65 MPH is a bit risky unless you do some changes.

I run a big nut tranny (no idea the ratios) on 205/75R14 el cheepo tires
with 1600DP C/W crank and 30PICT-3 carb 18-22 MPG.  Normally I run between
55-60 without problems and this keeps me in the low 3000 RPM area.  If I
take it up to 65 I am at 3500-3600 RPM which is a little too revved up and
gas mileage suffers.  At 70 MPH I am at about 3800-3900 RPM which is way too
high and gets very fishy on the highway.  From what I can tell the speedo is
pretty accurate.

As a note to everyone it is a good idea to install a temp sender if you like
to go fast.  It is pretty neat to see what the real sweet spot for the motor
is where it is at its thermal limits where it will maintain a specific heat
range and cruise all day, but if you take it too fast it starts to heat up
quick...  This applies mostly in the summer when over 80 degrees, in the
winter I have to work to get it to hit 180 :)

In the future I plan on some upgrades that will enable the bus to safely go
a little faster.  I horse traded some parts for a set of Porsche Fuchs
15&quot;x6&quot; alloys that I plan on putting on the buss with some good load rates
tires (see previous 15&quot; tire thread).  The key will be installing the Old
Speed 944 front brake kit and adaptors in the rear to keep the RGBs.  In the
future I may consider an IRS II conversion kit from Bus Boys (keeping stock
height) and using 944 components.  Granted I like the RGBs and when I do the
Joe Cali NextGen Type 4 conversion that motor can handle 4000RPM all day
which would be perfect for cruising between 65-75MPH.  No,  I am not
planning on a ghetto cruiser I just would like it to be semi-modernized for
safety.

Rennie how did you fit 914 brakes on the rear?  I am very curious if you
have details.

Take Care,
