&gt; CALIFORNIA CODES
&gt; VEHICLE CODE
&gt; SECTION 26700-26712
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 26700.  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a passenger
&gt; vehicle, other than a motorcycle, and every bus, motortruck or truck
&gt; tractor, and every firetruck, fire engine or other fire apparatus,
&gt; whether publicly or privately owned, shall be equipped with an
&gt; adequate windshield.
&gt;    (b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to any vehicle issued
&gt; identification plates pursuant to Section 5004 which was not required
&gt; to be equipped with a windshield at the time it was first sold or
&gt; registered under the laws of this state, another state, or foreign
&gt; jurisdiction.
&gt; 
&gt; 36515.  The provisions of Section 26700 relating to windshields
&gt; shall not apply to implements of husbandry.
&gt; 
&gt; So unless you can PROVE that your bus qualifies as an &quot;implement of
&gt; husbandry&quot; (farm vehicle), you are out of luck.
&gt;
