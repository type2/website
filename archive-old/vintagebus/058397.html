Subject: RE: [VB] 1600 SP valve Q

I've had a few heads actually suck in new valve seats that were not
installed correctly. Also, if you installed heavy valve springs there may be
some wear under the springs on the head. One of the other areas was ill
fitting lifters on assembly that finally seat all the way down after some
driving. That will also change your geometry. On my blocks That get larger
cams I usually have the lifter holes faced and 100 degree chamfer so I know
they are seating correctly and are all at the same height.

Just as a note, my son put together a 1500 a few years back and used a lot
of my extra parts from the unsorted boxes. He had a heck of a time with
lifter rattle until he tore it down and found out that one of the lifters he
used was a thin crown 40hp. Live and learn, and check your parts first!

Subject: [VB] 1600 SP valve Q


1600 SP now with ~9000 miles.
Before Everybus I found a tight #2 exhaust. Like no or close to no
clearance tight. Its around 2500 miles since and I adjusted the valves
this morn. Several valves needed a bit of adjustment but #2 was tight
again. I suppose Ill just have to keep an eye on it.
Im kind of wondering what most likely to be happening.
Any wear in the cam, lifter, rod or rocker should cause the valve to
become looser, right? So are the only possiblities the valve seat pounding
in or the valve itself stretching? Whatever it is I estimate that its
moved around 10-12 thousandths in the last say... 4500 miles.
Any comments appreciated.
