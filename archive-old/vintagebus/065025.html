Subject: Re: HOE-LEE schmokes~ hohoho, 48megs and a bottle of rum...

Sorry about the huge (48mb download) size. Thanks to my employer I was able to
view that in a jiffy. I would never try it at home via my POS 28.8 dial-up
connection. At least it was an attempt at creating a trend.

Now go ahead and tell me that you haven't at least *thought* about making your
VW bus/van/vanagon/eurotrash into a rolling escape hatch. &quot;If I had to haul-ass
I would...&quot; Next thing you know we will be discussing armor-proofing instead of
sound dampening matting. I vote that cut wheel wells, baja tires, TDI engined
Synchro conversions, dull painted diamond plate poptops, rattle can camoflauge
paint jobs with matching(cammmy painted)Jackmann spoke wheels, and
headlight/tail light blackout items, GPS units, Satellite radio, gas heaters,
HAM/Sideband/CB eq, solar battery trickle charging units, C.C. Crane dried
food/handcrank radios and rifle racks become the next trend.
Vote Republican on Tuesday. We need a good old fashioned war and a deeper
recession! The faster that we help OUR party control the house, senate and
Zecetive branch the sooner we can start WWIII. Hoo-Raw and remember the Tet~!
=)

We can all drive up to Northern Idaho to the first annual Ruby Ridge Memorial,
Ted Nugent supported &quot;Buses by the ASF Compound&quot; event. HA! and they laughed at
me when I stockpiled non-genetically engineered open germanated seeds, MRE's
and dehydrated water. Bahhahahahaha!

See you at RRMTNSBBASFC-1 event. Psst, don't tell anyone. Midnight Satellite
drop with Fanny pack with Bible and TP if you are/were with the 82nd. No time
for IG inspections! Catch the new trend now!
I'll bring the hollow points and Kool-aid for the kids just in case.
