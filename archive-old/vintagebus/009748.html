Did you ever meet an 18 wheeler on a 2 lane road with the safaris open?
WHAP   WHAP       bent the arms that hold them up. Now I open 'em about an
inch, turn the fasteners down &amp; let the fasteners rest on the rubber seals.

The law around here could care less. They got more important things to do,
like drink coffee.

Officer, &quot; Bubba, your eyes look bloodshot, have you been drinking?&quot;
Bubba, &quot; well, your eyes look sorta glazed, you been eatin' donuts?&quot;
