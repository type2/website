Subject: Re: [VB] Electric fuel pump

I have one of the Facet electric pumps mounted on the wheel well on the left
side of the engine compartment. I mounted it on rubber to reduce the noise
it transmits thru the body. It's still pretty noisy, but works very well.

&gt; I was thinking about using an electric fuel pump in my bus.  I think Cal
&gt; Grant had one in his '67 mounted to the left of the engine.  Anyone else
&gt; mounted an electric pump in the engine compartment?  Or anywhere else?
