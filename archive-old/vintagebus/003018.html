Dunno, my friend sent it to me.........Email = copyrighted? man they were
right when they said the internet has given into the system....
Im sure as many times as I've propped Wolfsburg West on the list, they'll
forgive me.


&gt;Not sure what the list etiquette is about re posting others stuff, but
&gt;people should know that this was originally posted in the Wolfsburg West
&gt;e-news letter.  Just wanted to set the record straight.  I'm sure it was
&gt;just an oversight by the person posting it.
