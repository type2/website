Subject: Re: [VB] oil cooler heater

This solution is less than optimal.  The heat exchangers and gas heaters are 
waaaaaay better than the minimal amount of heat you would get from an oil 
cooler.  Also running the lines for the cooler are an expensive PITA.  (AN 
fittings and SS lines are not cheap)

Also the engine would need changes to accomodate this remote cooler as well. 
  30mm oil pump to overcome the new length of lines.  Might have to get rid 
of the on case oil cooler in any hope of the remote cooler getting hot.  
Also the case would have to be tapped the right way and not with one of the 
filter pump Maxi things as it will not flow enough oil.

If you are hell bent on doing it fine, but it is not a good solution at all.

Later,
Adrian
