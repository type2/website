Hey Jason! Yeah my 57 deluxe had an original handle. They come with the
chrome ends. And as far as I know I thought allbusses had chrome ended
handles, could be wrong though. They are out there. Check OCTO they are
not hard to find. I think we even have a few.

&gt; Hey everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; There's an NOS deluxe dash grab handle on ebay. It's
&gt; the beige-grey one but it has chrome ends. Was these
&gt; the stock issue ends on deluxes with the plastic grab
&gt; handle?
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't seen ones with the chrome ends. Maybe I
&gt; haven't seen enough deluxes. But the repro shops only
&gt; have beige-grey ends. Has anyone seen a repro with the
&gt; chrome ends?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW: The bidding is at $102.50. I think someone is
&gt; building another $45,000 deluxe.

&gt; 67 deluxe soon to be ex-&quot;DARTHVW&quot; (no grab handle)
