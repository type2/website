I've had plety offered free/almost free ($50.00 or less) 

I guess thats one of the benefits of living in the rust belt... since the
cars rust away, the parts that are left are cheaper because there are so 
few cars to put em on :)

plus that stuff is expensive to ship, more expensive than the part can be
had for locally...
