&gt; &gt; Any double cab owners have a box speaker (5&quot;X5&quot;)
&gt; mounted above the rear
&gt; &gt; window.  Looks factory installed....not sure
&gt; though.
&gt; 
&gt; Not me.  Although I don't even have a headliner, and
&gt; I'm pretty sure it came
&gt; with one.
&gt; 
 Not me either.  I do have my headliner, and there
aren't any holes or anything either in the back where
you discribed.  Sounds kinda suspect to me.
