Subject: Dr. Nodzak - Want to order a ladder PDQ!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My sincere condolences to all who were close to Dr. Joe. I had the 
opportunity to aquire 1 of his tow bars and I am please with my purchase. I 
wanted to order a ladder but put it off. Now with this unfortunate news I 
want to order a ladder!

Please can someone put me in touch with Joe's shop so that I can order a 
ladder.

Thank you.
