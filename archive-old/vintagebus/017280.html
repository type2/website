My '66 had one, and I'm pretty sure I saw one on the '60, but haven't
explicitly looked for one on it.  At least, I've certainly found lots
of gas puddles over the years, and watched it dripping it out of a
tube that comes down next to the right rear wheel, directly below
where the gas filler is....

Agreed.  I usually make a point of doing fill-ups at the start of
trips (the commute to work qualifies, being a little over twenty
miles) for just that reason.
