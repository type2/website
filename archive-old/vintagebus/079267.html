Subject: Re: [VB] TO bearing misaligned with pressure plate?

  Most after market cross shafts are junk and made wrong to begin with. If it is a gold zimc one it is more then likely 
just made off .  There are a few ways to fix this depending on how off it is. One you can loosen the set screw on the 
shaft bushing and tap in over a little, you can get approx 1mm this way and just hope it doesn't move, back., or shit can 
the aftermarket HD shaft and find an original VW one, you can get them new. 
  Of course you didn't say what year bus so most here are assumming it's a split window. If it is the 70 bay as in your 
sig line, OE style shafts have just been reproduced and seem to be working fine better then the piece of crap 
aftermarket jo blow HD racer style ones.

&gt;Anyone run into the problem where the cross shaft positions the TO bearing
&gt;so that it is not concentric with the circular face on the pressure plate?
&gt;
&gt;I installed an aftermarket HD cross shaft and get a noise like a bad TO
&gt;bearing or gland nut bearing. When I pulled the engine I found fine metal
&gt;filings on the pressure plate around the area where the TO bearing contacts
&gt;it. Closer look shows that the circular face of the pressure plate that
&gt;meets the TO bearing has been pushed off center. This is evident by looking
&gt;at the center of the disc.
&gt;
&gt;I noticed when I installed the HD cross shaft that it carried the TO bearing
&gt;a bit off center but mistakenly thought it would function correctly.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else run into this?
