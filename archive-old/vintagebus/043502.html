&gt;Is there an electronic copy of the Type 2 Bentley around ?  If so
&gt;how about running some indexing SW against it as a first pass?

I know Bentley is releasing some of their manuals on CD but I don't
know if they've done the Type 2 manual yet.  The electronic manuals
I have seen from other manufacturers like Alldata typically have
scans of *everything* (so you'd have to OCR it first), use sooper-
sekrit file formats and such that you'd have to hack, and have
absolutely crappy navigation.  Oh yeah, Unix and Macs need not
apply.

So I think it might actually be easier to create the index with
biological optical-kinetic data transfer (typing it in) and then
using the computer to do what it does well: sorting, cross-
referencing, etc.

&gt;
&gt;before you go to this trouble to make an index. 
&gt;-  look for the contents page in the front of your book- it lists the
&gt;main sections.
&gt;-  in each main section at the front is a contents page, which lists 
&gt;the sub sections in that section.
&gt;
&gt;at least in my original there is.

My reprint has these too.  I just think sometimes it would be easier
to have everything in one spot at the back of the book.  Less 
flipping around to get to stuff.
