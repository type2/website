Subject: Re: Bicycle mounting

Dylan rode in with:
&gt;&gt; I've seen images of Single Cabs with bikes
standing in the bed before, and I'd like to do 
the same but I would do almost anything to avoid 
drilling holes into the bed to mount the bike chocks!&gt;&gt;

Use the KISS principle. Keep It So Simple or some
such variation on the wording ;)

Plywood with a pair of vertical 2x4's for the
wheels and some straps to hold them steady. Just
lay the plywood on the bed, load the bikes, tie
them down to the sides.

You can take the whole thing out anytime, no holes.

Jeff  no bus, but has a truck and carries bikes
