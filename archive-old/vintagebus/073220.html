Subject: Re: [VB] And the saga begins

Are you serious? This isn't a restoration, it's a
rebuilding to the owner's specs. Even Ronnie won't
call it a restoration. What's the
definition/difference between a &quot;restoration&quot; and 
&quot;vintage restoration&quot;? 
If wrong color, big engine, freeway flier trans,
&quot;custom&quot; interior, later front end (I'm assuming there
Ronnie, for bigger, later brakes) now classify as a
&quot;restoration&quot;, what is a &quot;Custom&quot; then?
Sorry, but it Ronnie's DC will NEVER be a RESTORATION
to me. It may be a nice rebuilding, but not a resto.
Call me a Vintage Nazi, I don't care.

&gt; Hey Ronnie,
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, you can call it a restoration. The
&gt; folks over on the R&amp;R
&gt; forum are just touchy. It's not like you're going to
&gt; call it a 'vintage
&gt; restoration', right? I'll consider it a restoration,
&gt; and I know most people
&gt; will too.

&gt; ----- Original Message -----
&gt; &gt; (notice I didn't say restored) as it is not
&gt; original color, interior,
&gt; engine, trans
&gt; &gt; and front end etc. so I choose to use the term
&gt; REBUILT as a replacement
&gt; &gt; word for a totaly redone non original VW
