I mis-read the part number.  The last digit is a &quot;6&quot; not &quot;8&quot;.  So the
package they came in was stickered &quot;231 067 706&quot;.

I ordered a new pop-top seal for my 1967 Westy.  Got it from Bus Depot, I
believe they source it from RMMW.

Anyway... this seal isn't very close to the one that was on there... at
least what I can make out.  OK, but if it keeps the rain out, I'll use it..

But the length is WAY TOO LONG.  Like 3 times what it needs to be.  The Bus
Depot order description clearly said 1967... but is this part possibly for a
loaf?!  It came sealed in the plastic bag with part number clear (and
description, which has no reference to year.  Just &quot;Seal, Westifalia Camper
Pop-Top&quot;.

Need a solution, heading on the first drive to Arizona in 24 hours!  Expect
lots of rain along the way or on return trip a week later.
