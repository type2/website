Fellow bussers -

Through much research in the archives and over at the egroups site,
I have gotten the following about rim rejuvenation:

First item of business is getting all the hubcaps clips off by either
smacking them with a chisel from the front side or center puch and drill
from the back, then pry carefully from the front.  Next up is to get
them either chemically stripped, &quot;wire wheeled&quot; or sandblasted.  Then
reattach new clips with either the rivets provided, other rivets, or a
small screw/locknut combo.  Apply finish (powder coat or paint).  Get
new tires mounted and reinstall on the bus.  Is that about correct?
If I have missed a step, please let me know.  I will be starting this
process Monday, so if I am missing something, there's still plenty of
time to correct me.

Thanks!
