Subject: Tranny ratios ... in my '57

If you've been following my progress you'll know that I was juggling 
tranny ratios so try and get stock height and nice gearing.  Here's what 
I've installed in the end from easily available parts:

Early 1200 tunnel from say a 60'ish bus gives a 0.82 4th (as with all 
buses) but the better 4.125 ring and pinion final drive (similar to a 
beetle, but beetle boxes don't have as good 4th gear unless you get a 
GT? box - rare though these days)

Then I fitted up the later 1.26:1 ratio reduction boxes.  This gives me 
about 61 mph at 3500 rpm.  If you compare this to a 1200 tunnel setup 
you get 55 at 3500 and for a stock 1500 setup (64-67) you get 58 at 3500 
(all dependent on tire size).  My original split case setup gave around 
44 mph _at_ 3500!! as it also had mountain ratio reduction boxes.  Clearly 
I'm a happier man as I've improved my cruising gear quite a lot.

Thought I'd share  : )

Having said all that I kind of felt a little guilty replacing all the 
stock transmission and axle setup as it was so original - but at least 
the bus still looks stock from most angles now.
