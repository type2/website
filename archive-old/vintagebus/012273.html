Hi folks,

The BN4 articles at http://www.buslist.dynip_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm contain
some significant updates.  The &quot;Parts Database&quot; page now includes a private
source for NOS BN4 parts as well as a commercial source and pricing for BA6
and early BN4 glow plugs.  I have yet to do business with the private
source, but by his own account he does appear to have a good supply of NOS
parts.  Also to help parts hunters, I added a listing of VW &amp; Espar part #s
for early (6 and 12 volt) and late style 12 volt BN4s.  For your
edification, the installation article now includes an interesting link to
Valcom, a manufacturer of a gas heater test stand (for newer non-Espar
makes).  The &quot;Eberspaecher BN4 Gas Heater in a '68-'74 Bus&quot; Article has been
significantly overhauled.  I've updated it to include enhanced operational
descriptions, parts testing and adjustment info, and an improved section on
what to look for when buying a used BN4 as well as the correction regarding
the temperature regulating switch that I mentioned on the list recently.  If
you saved a copy of the old one, toss it and keep this newer version, I
think it's quite improved.

As Ken said, http://www.buslist.dynip_dot_com/ is temporary and unfortunately
all the old info is still accessible from the type2 site until we can make
updates there.  So for now, point your browsers to
http://www.buslist.dynip_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm  or go to
http://www.buslist.dynip_dot_com/ and click on &quot;Ness-Tek&quot; to get all my latest
stuff.

In terms of updates on my page other than gas heater articles, there's now a
photo of my dash mounted gauge setup in the &quot;First Timer's 1600 Engine
Rebuild Notes&quot; article, and on a minor note, vendor names in the parts
checklist are now linked to their homepages. Also, I have a new write-up
describing my adaptation of an Audi oil cooler mounting for an auxiliary
cooler. I hope to have more photos of the mounting alone up soon, right now
I just have one picture of the cooler mounted under my bus.

Thanks to Ken Hooper for his steadfast efforts to build a thriving resource
for type2'ers.
