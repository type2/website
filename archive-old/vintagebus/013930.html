`51 until present...still make Eurovan
westys..available everywhere but the USA...I have seen
a couple eurovan westys in Canada.

FWIW westfalia made their 1000 camper in `59...so
between `51 an `59 very few exist.  Only 2 actuall
barndoor westys are 'currently' known to exist.  One
is in France and one owned by Darrell Adams in USA. 
Bothe are 54's if I recall.  In fact Westfalia does
not even own a 'real' barndoor westy.  The have a mock
up of a `51 but she is a fake.

Good luck
Todd

&gt; VW didn't make Westfalias, Westfalia did.  VW handed

&gt; Westfalia dolled it all up.  Started in the early
&gt; 50's - I've heard
&gt; '52, and went into the early 90's.  I don't know of
&gt; there are any eurovan
&gt; westfalias,  but that's irrelevant for the purposes
&gt; of our discussion.

&gt; &gt; What years did VW make Westfalias?  I have a

&gt; &gt; after 67?  I asked him if it had a bay window or a
&gt; split and he said he
&gt; &gt; didn't remember.  My fingers are crossed and I'll
&gt; let you know if I get it.
&gt; &gt; I just got a 59 panel and it needs allot of parts.
&gt; including a pan for the
&gt; &gt; drivers side.
