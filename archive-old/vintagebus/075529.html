&gt;I have made a Bus Wet bar and have it wired so that I can plug it into
&gt;my house. I need to know how I can run the headlights as well.  I went
&gt;to radio Shack and was told a 12v power converted would work (1000ma?)
&gt;it didn't.

Ah, Radio Shack.  &quot;You've got questions, we make up the answers.&quot;  A
12 V adapter will work, but you need something like 8,000 mA (8 A) to
light up a set of Bus headlights.  You could put eight of them in
parallel, but that's kind of a PITA to wire.

&gt;After a few seconds the lights dimmed and then went out.

That would be the adapter failing.  Get it replaced under warranty, but
don't use it for the headlights again.  :)

&gt;I am not intersted in blinding people I just want them to glow a bit,
&gt;sort of like a 12 volt headlight with a 6 volt battery.

You could put the low-beam filaments of each bulb in series, putting 6 V
across each filament.  Or, you could put the high and low beam filaments
of one bulb in series, putting about 6 V across each filament.

Anyway.  The &quot;official&quot; way to run the headlights is on 12 V DC.  Radio
Shack does sell a beefy power supply that will do this: 22-506, 12 V 10 A,
$100.  If you run 6012 bulbs with both low beam filaments in series, their
22-504, 12 V 3 A, $40 will probably do the job as well.

You can also do it from a car battery charger.  You can use a car battery
with the charger, but doing that will also make hydrogen, which usually
isn't so great inside your house.  Using just the charger works fine,
as long as it's a relatively &quot;dumb&quot; charger without automatic shutoff.
&quot;Smarter&quot; chargers will refuse to turn on if there isn't a minimum
voltage present; this is to help prevent backwards hookups and sparks.
Usually, the cheaper chargers will work better in this application.
You'll need 12 V at 8 A if you want to run the lights at full power and
12 V 4 A for lights in series.  Some chargers have a 6 V / 12 V switch;
you could wire the lights in parallel and run them on 6 V to get the
&quot;dim&quot; effect.

If you don't mind hauling a battery around, you could put a battery on
the bar and then haul it out to the garage or porch to charge it with a
charger you already have when it gets run down.  A &quot;deep cycle&quot; battery
will work better than a normal starting battery in this application.

Another option would be to use an old or surplus power supply from a PC.
You could run the headlights from the 12 V output, but you might also have
to put a small load (tail light bulb) on the 5 V output to get it to work.
Or, you could just run the headlights on the 5 V output directly.

Since you don't _have_ to be compatible with a battery, you could also
run the headlights on AC directly from a transformer.  The ones they
sell to run outdoor lighting will work just fine.  You need about 100
W to run both headlights at full power, or about 50 W to run the low
beams in series.  If the transformer has a photocell on it, put a piece
of electrical tape over it.

I hope this helps!
