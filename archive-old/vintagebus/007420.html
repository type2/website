Well all - I'm going to spare you all the exact facts and figured but I've
think I've got the CR fiasco nailed down.  I'm going to balance the CR
across the 4 cylinders by doing 2 things.  #1 - It's going to require a set
of .080 shims (I guess now this is considered a spacer) on all 4 cylinders.
Next off, I'm going to flip flop the heads side to side.  This ends up
requiring that I shave .5 cc less off of one cylinder and tends to match the
deck height a little better.  It still worries me that #1 is so off.   No
matter what, I have to hog out 4.5cc's yet out of this combustion chamber so
I guess I'll just start with the Makita die-grinder until I think enough is
enough.  I checked the 2 cylinders in question once more and got the same
results.  When I'm done, the CR across the cylinders will be
6.91/6.92/6.95/6.93  I would like to have the extra power that 7 or 8 gives
but this is for a bus.  Heavy loads and poorer cooling than a bug - I DON'T
need to be overheating.  I'll still develop some healthy horsepower though.
As long as the engine will shove me down the road at a good 65 to 70 solid,
that's all I want - I don't really expect to get to 65 or 70 in record
time - just to be able to maintain it.  All day if need be.

I may not be on the list for a day or so - I'm gonna buckle down and get
this cc'ing taken care of.  Also, I've been told by several people that
despite the jugs fitting loose into the heads, with this kind of low CR -
they should still seal okay.  I just don't care for the slipping and
slopping of the jugs myself since the stock ones fit so much more snug.  My
brrother (the walking Berg book) didn't seem like it was any big concern to
him.  We'll see what happens though.

Later!
