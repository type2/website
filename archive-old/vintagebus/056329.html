Subject: Re:'59 Westfalia in Hot VW's 

  Great to hear your '59 will be in the &quot;mag&quot;!  It will be a=20
'special-keeper-issue' for sure.  With Dan's Binz coming=20
out on the cover of a mag and yours, I have to get back to=20
work on my '61 Westy, it's been almost a year since I=20
have even looked at it.
  Somewhere outside my house it's hiding and I know=20
there's a motor around somewhere that is supposed to=20
go in it.  Hmmmm, I better check Liz's new 'flower garden',
it has a somewhat familiar shape to it!  8^p
  If all goes together, I'll be parked next to you at OCTO
this June
