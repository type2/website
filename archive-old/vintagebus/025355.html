I use combination wrenches - 2 of 'em.  the 17mm that fits, then I add a second
wrench, whaatever's fairly long.  I fit the box end on the second wrench over
the open end of the 17mm, essentially giving me a longer 17mm. You have to try
it a couple ways before you figure it out.  It also helps to take some of the
weight with a jack or something.  I usually break all 4 free before I remove any
one nut.  Yeah it means going around twice but who's in a hurry?  With practice,
my wife and I got engine removal down to 17 minutes from setting the barely
adequate tool kit on the ground at the rear of the Tinkertoy.

&gt; Alright..got the bottom two 17mm nuts out..that was easy. The next two, the
&gt; ones on top. Reach around behind the fan housing and loosen them, thats the
&gt; name of the game, right? HA! Funny joke, I bet you're all sniggering (thanks
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb) as you read this.
&gt; &quot;HeeheheehahahHAHAH! He's talking about those two bolts on top that are a
&gt; royal pain in the *insert expletive*!&quot;
&gt; Ok. So whats the deal here? Can't get a breaker bar anywhere. don't relish
&gt; the idea of trying to loosen them underneath as I don't want an air cooled
&gt; engine case shaped cavity in my ribcage, and I can't even see where they are
&gt; to spray free all on them. So am I the victim of a cruel joke, am I missing
&gt; something, did the one guy who pulled my engine for a clutch job think he'd
&gt; be funny and tighten them with an air ratchet, or what? The bottom two came
&gt; off easy, these top two are still laughing at my fuitile efforts to free
&gt; them as we speak. Thanks for any help.
