I Wrote: &lt;&lt; A friend of mine said that he once saw a guy at a swap meet
that made aluminum reproductions of the trim. Any ideas????&gt;&gt;
You Wrote: &lt;&lt; As for the aluminum trim on the cabinet doors.  Westfalia kits never
came with any aluminum trim on the doors.  It is all beige plastic trim.
If your camper has aluminium trim, it may be a Sundial or a Camp America
camper conversion. &gt;&gt;

Sorry Steve and List, I wasn't clear. My Westie does have beige plastic trim around
the cabinet openings. My friend told me about a guy that makes aluminum reproductions
of the plastic trim. Sure its a cheat but all of my plastic trim has shrunk after 34 years
and aluminum painted beige might be the way to go. Any thoughts???
P.S. Thanks for the lead on Dawn, I talked to her about tents, but not fabric. I'll contact
her.
