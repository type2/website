Subject: Heater/hal dist FS

I have found more things I need to unload

I have a heater the PO said was from a 65 I bought to put
into my 72 westy however I have decided to try to find one a
little closer in vintage to mine.  It appears to be in good
shape, however I have not tried to run it.  It is a 6V
Price $175 plus shipping

I also have a hal effect dist from a  79 cal engine.  $75
+shipping  this includes it the little wiring harness if you
need it. Otherwise I'll give to someone who needs it

Brent
