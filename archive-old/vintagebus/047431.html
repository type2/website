Subject: Re:  [VB] Main jet upgrade 34pic3

Hi all renoir here.

I want to increase the main jet size in my 34-3 carb.

1600dp,009, electronic ignition.

I purchase a 140 and a 145 but when i take out the main jet, that puppy is

small.

Question?

Is my only option to drill and rethread?


thanks all.

get a main jet that fits the carb.   I have found that japanese motor cycles 
use the same sort of jets as solex and is you go to a motorcycle shop odds 
are you can buy the jet you need for peanuts.
