&gt; I put on a new clear fuel filter, and I can see that the fuel filter is

Hi John,
The carb can not suck the fuel at all.  Best to check fuel pump push rod for 
proper length &amp; hieght, and possibly the fuel tank gas cap for venting and 
outlet filter sock for being plugged up if your engine is acting as if it is 
starving for fuel.  If you are only having problems with idling you most 
likely are not having a fuel to carb problem because that would cause more 
and more problems the higher the RPMs went.  Instead it sounds like you need 
to clean the carb, check for proper jetting and experiment with the jetting, 
and probably need to properly adjust the carb also.
