I know a guy with a 66 deluxe that he got from like original or 2nd owner 
that was totally complete and it had the single circle mirror on drivers 
side as well

66delux



&gt;&lt;&lt; Not necessarily true, the 66 deluxe (church bus) untouched all original
&gt;bus came with only 1 round mirror on the drivers side, mirrors were an 
&gt;option
&gt;and basically it was what ever the dealer installed.
