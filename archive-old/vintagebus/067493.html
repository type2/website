Subject: RE: [VB] pre 62 felt channel

  We were involved in making the non through the glass latch bottom felts, I
have them in stock.
  I haven't really annouced it yet till I had a few out there for fitting
before offering for sale.
  We also just had made early mirror arms for round mirrors. These are EXACT
copies of originals that I purchased from Mr Barns himself, made of steel
like originals, not stainless, correct thickness etc. In a container,
arriving in a week or so

ps. the felts in the U S A version come in a roll and are not cut right or
have the notchs in them

Subject: [VB] pre 62 felt channel


hi all

ive search through the archive about a new front windows felt channel and
all ive found is that we can purchase one at jc whitney.

Is this the best way to restore the front windows channel ?

where else is there felt kit for a 60 bus?

Ive seen COMPLETE DELUXE DOOR SEAL KIT for busses 50-67 on California
import, channel seems included, and there is a brazil and USA version... is
the USA version worth the extra money?  at least you get all the other
rubbers...

thx for any input
