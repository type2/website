Hi Jamie,
Good point (Please excuse the pun!), but also it could have happened that
Brad left the ignition key on power too long without the engine running.  If
this is done and the points are closed the electricity will pour through the
points overheating the condensor to points wire in three or four minutes.
Resulting in burnt points, melted and burnt wiring resulting in grounding,
and/or burnt out condensor.  So make sure to check the points, wiring and
condensor for signs of burnt and grounding.
