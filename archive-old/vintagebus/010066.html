I just bought a Bosch rebuilt starter from Kragen/Checker. It came in a
Motorcraft box, and was rebuilt by them, but was stamped Bosch. It was a
really nice rebuild job, new contacts, armature turned and undercut. New
bearings. Lifetime guarantee. Roadside protection. I like it.

On another electrical note, I think I have solved the problem of how to use
a Motorola alternator out of a super beetle on any air cooled engine using
off the shelf parts. This is the external regulator model that either had
the regulator mounted on top, or remotely under the beetle rear seat. It is
possible to use a $30 electronic voltage regulator (or pull one off a super
beetle) and have a trouble free, 55 amp, 12 volt system for a 1/3 the cost
of a kit. The alternator uses a different stand than the generator. This
probably isn't for everyone, but there's still enough of these around in
boneyards to make it worth while. Let me know if anyone is interested in the
details.
