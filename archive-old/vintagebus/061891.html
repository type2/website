&gt; I am currently in Indiana on business (I am from the UK) and would like to
&gt; get one of these internal pipe wrenches so that I might be able to solve my
&gt; loose oil filler problem - however I am not sure what is meant by a hardware
&gt; store - let alone the names of businesses I should try.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen a Home Depot a few miles away - would this place sell them or
&gt; are there any other chain stores that I should try and find the location of?
