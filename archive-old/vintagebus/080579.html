Subject: Tie rod fun - Done!

With the right parts jobs seem soooo much easier ;)

I ended up getting the right tie rod assembly locally, granted for $45 which 
is a little high.  But still cheaper than overnighting a mail order part.  
But it is a nice German Mayle part which is good.

Now to get the rear end sorted out!  This IRS installation is a pain.

A special thanks to Dave Easterwood and Dave Pritz for borrowing the special 
&quot;pickle fork&quot; to get the tie rods off.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
