Hi Eric
It could even just be that the dog house stand is not drilled through 
completely!  We knew of a little old lady who had this happen from the volks 
in Germany.  If we were you, we would just dissassemble that engine and go 
through it.  Drilling the oil passages is easy if that is the problem as long 
as first you study what you are doing.  Plus then you can balance the rods, 
pistons, down to nothing instead of 5 gram of each other, have a welded 
counter balanced crank, flywheel, and clutch pressure plate balanced to each 
other.  Polish the heads intake, exhaust ports, and clean any casting flash 
out of the cylinder and head fins.  Since you will probably have to $hip the 
engine back to the place you bought it and there is no absolute guarantee 
that the next will be any better.  Going through the one you now have and 
ending up with an engine that is far better than any you could have bought 
for the same price!   Eric&amp;Barb
