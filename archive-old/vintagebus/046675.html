Hi Thom,
Yes, but that takes a long time.  Since 2/3 of the oil in the center section 
stays, except when the bus is really turned hard enough to throw the oil to 
one side and more gets through the axle on that side.  The RGB bearings are 
more likely to go far sooner.  Either way not something you want to have 
happen and why we walk around our bus visually checking all the wheels for 
leakage especially on long trips just before getting back in our bus.
