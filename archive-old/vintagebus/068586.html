Subject: Re: [VB] hangin a rear bumper

Tom,
There are six &quot;attachment&quot; points actually. Two bolts per bumper bracket, plus a bolt on each end that goes through the rear corners into your splash pans. There are two other nut/bolt combos that attach the splash pans to the bumber brackets just behind the overriders. Maybe you're missing the splash pans? 
When you get ready to mount it up get some help and I put towels over the ends to keep from scratching up my bus.
