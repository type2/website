One of my importers just informed me that they just recieved a load of BUS
steering boxes rebuilt in Brazil? I know TRW rebuilt type 1 boxes there but
never knew they did bus boxes. I have a couple on the way to test before
offering them for sale. I will dissasemble 1 to see how they are rebuilt.
What I am looking for are new parts like in the rebuild kits that WW are
supposed to be getting from Brazil.

ps, these will be sold outright (if they pass my testing)

There is no &quot;adjustment left in&quot; when it comes to steering boxes; when they
get to the point where you're monkeying with it, it's a sign from The Great
Bob
that you need to get it rebuilt...

&gt;     I have  a loose steering box that has seen better days. I have found a
&gt; used 65 steering box with some adjustment left in it.
&gt; What I want to know is there anything different with this box from my 67
&gt; box. Any information is appreciated!
&gt; The number on the 65 steering box is 211 415 151A.
