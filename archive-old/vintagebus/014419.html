HI Ya'll,

  I have been away from the list for a while because
my computer was down and I just fixed it. 

  Looking for Aarron, Are you still on the list? I am
sorry but that I have not got back to you sooner but I
had a problem and I also had my aol account taken off
line so I also lost your particulars. If you are still
interested in the mat you write to me here this is my
new address. And I promise I will get you the info
asap provided that y computer dosn't conk out again.

  I have just recently moved to Victoria BC and I was
wondering if there was any body on the list here? I
see a lot of splits here but do not know the owners.
My bus is the biege and chocolate two tone bus with
the dormobile roof. If you see me rippen around town
stop me and say hello. I don't know of any shops or
mechanics around here. My address is 1034 Princess st
and # is 381-0570.  


 Thanx 
Chris
