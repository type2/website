Subject: TSS Test

Well the repaired TSS passed the the test. I hooked it up to a flasher (small
aluminum type) and to 150 watts of driving lights (3 50 watt lights). It
worked perfectly on both right and left sides. The TSS was from my '67 Kombi I
totaled in a head on crash. Wolfsburg West when they last had them in stock
wanted $225 for one for a 66-67 USA TSS. This one was repaired for a dimes
worth of nyties and rubbing alcohol. So don't toss out that TSS that won't
work. Give it a shot at repairing it. And if your gonna toss it ..... toss it
my way.....lol.

See Ya at the BBB VII
