Subject: Re: [T2] Bus sighting [It's Friday]

&gt; If it is a 23 window wouldn&quot;t it have to be 1963 at
&gt; the 
&gt; newest?
&gt;
&gt; ---- snip ----
&gt; a gorgeous 23-window deluxe... The movie was
&gt; released in 

yes i saw the movie in the middle of the night also
and it has bullet turn signals i thought it was a 62
but it could be 63 also.
great shots lots of times of the bus. nice to see in a
movie rather than just a quick pan going by on the
street or a retro bus but then i suppose if we watched
movieds from the 60's more then we'd see more ;-)
