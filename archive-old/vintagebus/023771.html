Subject: engine lid attatchment '64

Hi all,
Once again I apreciate those you have been helping me identify parts.
Since I sold my '74, I should have more time to actually do something to
the '64 instead of just reading about how to do it. :)  Here is my
question

Where my engine lid hinge hooks onto the bus, one side doesn't have any
threads. I currently have a hanger strung throught there to keep it up.
I am looking for fixes for this. These are those that have been
suggested, and I want feedback on them please.

1) replace the whole peice. $9.99 plus labor. My welder friend said
&quot;damn too many spot welds to be drilled out&quot; But of course I guess I
could do these if he shoed me how.

2) Try to thread the holes that are there with a tap and use larger
bolts. I wonder id the sheet metal can really be threaded?

3)Drill 2 holes above the hing. Put hinge in place and weld through the
holes. I really don't want it to be permenant.

So fire away on ideas, I am listening.
Thank you.
