&lt;&lt;I've seen this statement used quite a bit recently on Buses for sale.


It seems that would vary quite a bit from area to area.


I'm assuming it means &quot;No Rust&quot; since I live in AZ.  ;)  Of course, &quot;No

Rust&quot; has it's own meaning...


So are these the usual places:

Rockers

Front floors

Cargo floor

Belly pans (if installed)

Battery tray

Inside rear corners (truck only)

Lower nose

?
