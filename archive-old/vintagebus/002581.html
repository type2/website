So my distributor number is both of the following
0231 170 034 and 043 905 205
can anyone tell me anything about it.  It seems kinda wierd actually,
because when use the idiot book and try and set it to the grove, or notch in
the edge it seems to point in the wrong way.  I want to order points etc..
and I have never been asked for my distributor number before - I always just
use the number on the old condenser.  This time the FLAPS asked for my
distributor number so I thought I would go that route - blah, blah, blah.
