Hi all,
My little '66 was recently attacked and stripped to the bone.
While it was probably my fault for parking it in an area populated mostly by
two-legged animals, it nontheless suffered the loss of all of it's cool
little Westy goodies.
No more fold down bed... no more fold up table... no more fridge... no more
closet... no more carpet?

I'm determined to rectify the situation - but I'll have to make what I can't
afford to buy.

I don't suppose any of you kind campers know where I can buy a set of
patterns or plans for all those wooden things I took for granted?

Regards and thanks in advance

Jim
