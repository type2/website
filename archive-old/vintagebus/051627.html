Subject: Re: [VB] rear hatch removal

You have to remove half of them and loosen the rest; some have a notch
that the hinge slides past, the others don't.

Lots of liquid wrench and patience, my friend...

&gt; I am trying to swap the rear hatches on my 60's. The one is bent in at the

&gt; and after fighting it for a half hour I figured I better stop before there 
&gt; is nothing left. Is there another way to remove the hatch? or do I have to 
&gt; take out all the screws? It is pretty rusty in there.
