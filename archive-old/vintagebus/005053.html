If this helps, try Real Source - 800-LUV-BUGG or www.800luvbugg_dot_com
They have German plates at $34.95 each or Rocky Mountain Motorworks where
you'll find these at $39.75 for personalized plates and $34.75 for random
plates. Take a look at eBay as well. I've been collecting plates for a while
now and can tell you that there is nothing like the original or at least
looking like one. All those personalized look fake and, oh yeah,  there are
no personalized plates in Europe.

&gt; I've got a couple of license plate holders from overseas and I'd like to
&gt; mount them with some plates on my bus.  Does anyone have a neat set of
&gt; plates from Germany or anywhere else that they would like to sell me?
&gt; Something custom would even be better but I'd settle for just some old
&gt; expired plates in decent shape.  Thanks!
