Subject: 36 dual Dells . . .

Greasy Volks,

Art Thraen rebuilt my Dells and I bought a kit from him for
installation:  manifolds, linkage and air filters, put together by CB
Performance, as I recall.  

When I tried to put the manifold/carbs on, the dang things (manifolds)
hit the side of the engine tin before going down over the studs, all the
way to the ports on the heads.  Not even close to being able to snug
them up using the nuts.  

What to do?  grind off some aluminum on the manifolds, or trash some
engine tin with a crow bar?

Have you ever noticed how aftermarket parts just plain don't fit? 
Aaarrrggghhh!!!!

PLV,

Curt
