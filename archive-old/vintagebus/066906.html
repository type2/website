&gt;where did you get the spec for the motor? does this apply to all split
&gt;windows? mine is a '65, still 6volt.

The spec is in the Bentley.  They used the same motor from about 1958
to about 1964.  On that style, the motor is a squarish thing sitting
right in back of the gearbox.  On the later style, the motor is round
and it sits off to the right of the gearbox.

&gt;how involved/difficult is it to clean/regrease the wipre motor? any
&gt;special tools needed? or just screwdrivers/wrenches...

Just screwdrivers and wrenches.  Be careful of the small parts.  One
of the gear shafts has a plastic bearing at one end that's part of the
sheet metal cover and stays with the cover.  The other end has a tiny
thrust washer (maybe 2mm diameter) that's easy to miss.  One of the
gears in mine was fiber.  Don't dunk a fiber gear in a carb bucket
overnight, but a spritz of cleaner is OK.  I used high-temperature
wheel bearing grease in mine.

If yours is like my '64, the motor side has a metal cover with a wire
bail holding it on, like a valve cover.  Pop that cover off and eyeball
the workings of the motor - make sure there isn't oil or grease all over
the brushes.
