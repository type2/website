Hmmm I was curious to see if this bus was at the july seattle meet?
I rmemeber seeing it, DEFINATLY attracted my attention.
My friend has a 56 thats a *TOUCH* nicer, he only wants 30K for his.

&lt;&lt;Here's a &quot;can't see it worth a damn&quot; picture of Craig's '57 Deluxe off my 
site behind a truck he sold:

The rear wheel well is hidden by a tree, a few listees might not like that.  
(heh-heh, inside joke)

Seriously, I'd sell my badass ex-daily driver '55 Barndoor Kombi for around 
$10K, with *all* my parts for it, including an extra 20- engine, Barndoor 
shop manual, NOS parts, etc..  I would then extend Craig an offer...
