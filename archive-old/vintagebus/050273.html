Subject: Re: [VB] Engine won't start

&gt;were you extra-careful to make sure the float moved easily?

I did, but it's definatly worth checking again.

&gt;is the output pressure of the fuel pump correct?  Too strong, and it'll
&gt;just fountain right past it.

This is what's happening I believe. I had WAY too much. I'll take the tip
from you and Craig K and check to see if there is a regulator doing it's
job.

It really seems like a fuel thing. I'll let you know how it goes this
afternoon. Thanks for the help.
