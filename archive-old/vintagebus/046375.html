Rocky Mountain Motorworks just finally started stocking these.  The Snap On
man has a similar tool in his arsenal, but I like the double sided one in the
Motorworks catalog.  You may have seen this type of tool in use in the Lindsay
Porter DIY VW Restoration Guide.  They were also 15 bucks or so as opposed to
$35 for the one I got from Snap On.  Nifty tool IMHO.
