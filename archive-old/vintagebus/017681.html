I try to always keep a log of fueling up, and miles covered. Typically I get
around 17-19mpg in the city, and 22-24 on the highway. I have done a few long
trips(boston to houston and back, 2000 miles; boston-dc 500 miles) and those
number don't seem to vary much. Once i peaked around 25 mpg, but i don't htink
the tank filled all the way because my next tank was down around 19mpg(on a
long trip).

I have a 1600, single port, I think vacuum advance, 28 pict carb. I believe an
original transmission, so i guess it is not a 'freeway flyer'.  I can't recall
my tire size, that probably does something to affect mileage. I woul love to
improve it, i am thinking trying the electronic ignition, and possibly the CDI
module hoover wrote about. But i need to try to straighten out some of my
electrical stuff first(headlight switch still very hot, i've cleaned every
contact i can think of, i'll try again this weekend-more aggresively)
