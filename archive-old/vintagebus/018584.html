thank you all for your help in just the first few hours that i posted. ive
beeen doin some snoopin and if you are looking for vw manuals/random books and
live as far away as possible from most vw swap meets like myself (upstate ny)
try www.allbookstores_dot_com they seemed to have most of the major books listed
from several bookstores to let you see the best prices (they also include an
estimated shippping cost)
also what is the list concensus on using the 3:88 ring and pinion in a bus
trans to get better speed, any major problems after many miles? any after only
a few? and is the trans in a 58 different from later splits in case the case
with the truck is cracked or unrebuildable? i know i said i want to keep it
stock, but hey im also putting in lap belts and a fuel gague :) ok im done
again thanks
