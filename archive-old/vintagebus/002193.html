i  recently bought one of these for my 1600 SP. It had a cutoff valve on it
and the shop said it was garbage and they always run a 50 in place of that,
So in it went. The guy claimed the carbs are very hard to get and that was
his last one..so i dunno if RMMW has them in stock or not.  part number

&gt;the availability on a
 manual choke 30pict?does anyone know a scorce/dealer for one of  these?-&gt;
&gt;Hi cameron,
RMMW has them for $109.95.  Looks like a good setup for 1500-1641cc engines
in pe-1961 buses with choke cable.  If you get one please keep us posted on
it's venturi size.  Eric&amp;Barb&gt;
