Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

I've started driving my '65 every day and wondering:  anybody else have 
trouble seeing through the front window?  I'm 6'2&quot; and my eye level is 
even with the top of the window unless i bend myself into a question 
mark.  Hard to see the signal change....

&gt;I have a '66 westy that I drive everyday, cold or hot, rainy or sunny and
&gt;sometimes snowing.
&gt;It doesn't matter what the weather is like or where I'm heading, anytime I
&gt;drive, I'm looking through 
&gt;two windshields and lovin' every minute of it.
&gt;Hopefully I'll be drivein' my DC soon, but until then, it's all about the
&gt;westy.
