Subject: 13 window for sale $1200
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I took another look at the 13 window the guy has for
sale out here in L.A.
Here are some more details:

I believe it is a 66. Had round pushbutton door
handles and a mesh grey interior, red/white exterior.


It has been rolled.The roof is pretty much all scraped
and dented and the passenger side upright between the
front cargo and passenger door is pushed in a bit.
There is a 1&quot; puncture in the driver's side near the
back vents, and bondo evidence there.

The front floors and rockers/apron look solid. All
popouts are solid and nice. The engine is a 1600 DP he
says runs great, tranny is fine too. missing nose trim
and emblem. Has complete front bumpr w/trim sans
rubber. Deluxe trim on driver's side and rear hatch
good, passenger side scraped. NO MIDDLE SEAT.

All panels and chrome on interior from what I saw,
holes in door panels and upper rear corner has
speakers in them, has ash tray and grab handle on
divider panels. Has rear seat kickpanel, has jailbars
on windows, not on seat. Front seat and rear bench
have okay black vinyl upholstery. Has deluxe clock and
grabhandle in dash. Has washer bottle with wasted
bellows

Cab floor mat, seat stand mat, seatbelts, orig. rims,
tires OK. Been sitting for 8 years.

Runs. The guy says it only needs a carb overhaul and
new front left brake line, maybe cylinder.

He wants 1200. I think he'd take 1000.

If anyone out here wants to check it out, email me. I
think it's worth more as parts. I can only own one bus
right now. I wanted the panels for DARTHVW but the guy
wont part it.

Anyone interested?

Jason
