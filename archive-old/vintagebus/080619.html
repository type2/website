Subject: Re: [VB] re: dynamat &amp; insulating between the floor and belly
  pans

&gt; Torch down roofing comes in a roll of about 50 feet and is about 3 feet
&gt; wide and is basicly a sheet of rubber/tar like material. It is also
&gt; typically about a 1/4 inch thick..........

 roofing torch down material (used on flat roofed buildings). I figure
&gt;&gt; I would literly torch it down the same way before installing the new
&gt;&gt; floors.
...............

Another similar product but  a lot easier to work w/ is bituthane such as
&quot;Ice &amp; Water Shield&quot; by WR Grace- it's a rubber-like roll roofing
underlayment for roofing that is applied in areas where ice damming occurs
at roof eaves, etc.  You can nail thru it &amp; it seals itself!!!- the stuff is
about 1/8&quot; thick, comes in 3' w. rolls &amp; self adheres to whatever it's
placed on. It's like tar w/o the mess.

FWIW,

Tom Buese
