Not sure if friday topics are ok or not today, but thought I would give it a try.

Does anyone watch the X-Files out there, On Sunday they showed the Lone Gunmen(a group of three computer hacks0 driving an old VW bus. I thought it was pretty cool, and was hoping it would be a splittie, when I first started seeing it. I then realized it wouldn't work, as teh characters had to slide the door open quickly, then juump in the side, doesn't work wuite that smoothly with the double doors on the side.

As a new 'bus appreciater' I couldn't give you the year and make of it, but i would venture to say it loooked like a late '60's model
