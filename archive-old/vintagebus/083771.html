Subject: Re: [VB] re:hot wire at light switch

Kevin,

It could that the Bl-Wh wire is corroded and acting as a resistor. That
would cause the heat and drop the voltage, leading to dimming of the 
headlights. You could measure the voltage drop across that connection
if you have a multimeter to test this theory, or just replace the wire
with an equally thick one.

Good luck,
Richard

&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what else there is to do, but replace the black and white
&gt; wire. I imagine the high temp of the wire is due to some resistance 
&gt; somewhere in the line. Would this also cause my headlights to be dim?
&gt; I don't see how they are related-but I'm not an electrical expert...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; -kevin
