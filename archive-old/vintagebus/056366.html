Subject: Re: [VB] REV LIMITER?

Were there any of these made to fit a DP motor with a 34pict 3 on it?

&gt; It's not a rev limiter - it's a *governor* - it works by means of a
restrictor
&gt; plate that adjusts according to the flow down the manifold.  It's adjusted
&gt; via a spring under the aluminum cover - tighter == higher revs; looser ==
lower revs.
&gt; There isn't a direct link between revs and the restrictor, though.

&gt; &gt; I have a motor that I picked up a few years ago out of a 65 bus that has
a
&gt; &gt; rev limiter on it under the carburater,(at least that is what I think it
&gt; &gt; is). It's got a flat plate on the front of it, I was wondering if anyone
&gt; &gt; knew what years and models these went on and can they be rebuilt if they
go
&gt; &gt; bad. Also how do they work? Thanks.
