The article is true and VWoA is on the warpath, (check my post on
trademarks). I got a phone call from a supplier in Colorado and he read me
the text of the article over the phone. Thank goodness his products are all
licensed and Genuine VW,(hence his prices)five minutes later Thom posted it.
This has been going on for a while and they are working their way back to
there motherland after raping the West Coast. The secret was making
purchases off of RAG MAG ads and/or internet. They were sure to order parts
with VW copyrighted markings, after receiving said items they would go on
and BUST them. RMMW has been under investigation for some time and it was/is
most of there suppliers on the WEST coast that have been harassed by Vow. I
wonder if they are working on some immunity thing, turn in everyone you get
stuff from and we will let you off the hook after we bust them!.Who is the
bad guy VWoA or RMMW trying to get everyone shut down to lessen their
competition. Now I know why I got a suspicious order for Wolfsburg Crest
seatbelts from a address in Detroit, which upon calling to verify turned out
to be a Hoax.
  The funny thing about this whole VWoA thing is that there are more new
repo parts coming out then ever, soon you would be able to assemble a whole
bus from REPO parts.
  Another aspect is that maybe VWoA is finally going to come out with there
long talked about NLA catalog like Porsche did years ago.

ronnie  az   let VWoA check my parts out

That article is so poorly written that I'm pesimistic of it's origin as
well. There may be a grain of truth in it though. I seem to recall (less and
less of that as time slips by) that to keep a copywrite or trademark, the
owner has to defend it. If that is truely the case then VW is between a rock
and a hard place. They can't really support us and keep their rights. I just
hope that they hunt for infringement as little as they can in order to save
their rights.
