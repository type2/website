&gt; I am leaning toward option b, Mexican longblock, 
&gt; ala Ronnie.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is, how well will the engine tin and
&gt; other components fit? My dead engine is a 1600 SP 
&gt; with the non-doghouse oil cooler. The new longblock 
&gt; is a 1600 DP with doghouse oil cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I will have to get an oil cooler stand, fan 
&gt; shroud, and intake manifold. Will there be anything 
&gt; else?

there is a whole bunch more that you will need. make
sure that you get a distributor drive gear. i don't
know if they are supposed to come with one, but mine
didn't. as far as the tin, you might as well get new
tin. it's not that expensive to begin with, plus it's
shiny to go with your new motor! why put old parts on
a brand new motor? i got mine from cali imports. it
was $1195, which was the cheapest that i could find.
RMMW had the exact same motor for $1495 + core. both
had core charges. try to talk them out of the core
charge. tell them that you are buying a NEW engine.
