Subject: Re: [VB] VW list and trademark violations

Joan Doe wrote:

&gt; My name is Joan and I'm a legal assistant at a law firm in Texas. I saw

It does not seem to be. In fact, since VW never used the designation 
&quot;Type 2&quot; to describe anything, it would be unlikely that they 
trademarked the term.
