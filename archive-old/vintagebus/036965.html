Subject: Re: [VB] 1960DC Pop- Outs??

This thread repeats less frequently than most, but as I recall them, here are 
some previously discussed differences:

1962 was the change year - older DC's had the 'odd ball' stuff, newer was 
like most other buses.

'61 and older had the following DC-only (I think) features:  

latches were, as mentioned, similar to, but not exactly like the barndoor 
latches, being somewhat larger and having black knobs.  Parts from one style 
latch will not work on the other style latch.

Pop-out frames have a horizontal mount for the '2-screw end' of the latch.

The triangular pattern for the '3 screw end' of the latch (on the 3rd door or 
on driver's side of the bus) is different than the pattern for the later type 
of latch.  This means that a cargo door from a bus will not work on a DC 
(unless of course you use that door's pop-out).

Again, these are things that I have either learned from my experience or from 
other list members the last time this thread came around.

Hope it helps,
