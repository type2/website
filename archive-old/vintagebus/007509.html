&gt;well...even after all that trouble yesterday....it did abso-funking-lutely
&gt;nothing.  Not a thing.  Hours and hours of work for nothing....and I STILL
&gt;don't know what the problem is.
&gt;It seems as if the cable isn't being pulled far enough to disengage the
&gt;clutch....but I went through the pedal assembly and there is nothing wrong
with
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Now I'm thinking gland nut ...I didn't think that the bearings in there
would
&gt;grab that hard though.  maybe I can find it somewhere else
&gt;today....hopefully...because I don't want to pull the motor again and I
REALLY
&gt;don't want to replace a gland nut.
&gt;
&gt;anything that I'm missing???
&gt;I've been through the clutch, pressure plate (the correct one), the T/O
&gt;bearing, the clutch fork (welds are fine and its not bent), new cable, new
&gt;bowden tube, wingnut is fine and not stripped, and the pedal assembly seems
&gt;just a-OK.


I know this is after the fact Isaiah but this whole thing you are going thru
kind of backs up a few things that I do with every engine pull on a VW that
I'm unsure of the maintenance past on.  For instance, on this 67 bus of
mine, some extra things I did was clean and inspect the gland nut and grease
it lightly (too much and it will slop all over the clutch.)   I also pulled
off the flywheel and cleaned up the area around the cam plug and installed a
new flywheel seal.  End play was still within spec.  The reason I do all
these things is because of situations such as yours where you are now left
with doubts about the gland nut.  I would almost bet that before long,
you'll be losing oil from the seal and have to pull the engine again.  On
the next engine pull, go ahead and either do these things or have them done
(new flywheel seal, clean back of case with brakleen or other good spray
cleaner, inspect cam plug) - it's Murphy's law that these things will fail
at the worst possible times.  I've never had a failure yet of any of these
items because I check them with every engine pull (even if I was the last
one to work on it.)

As for the clutch, I have the one with all the little fingers (looks like a
later model IRS one) but it has the integral ring in the middle of those
springs.  The throwout bearing has a big metal ring type of face on it.  The
other bearing and pressure plate that I pulled out was some funky 3 arm deal
with a triangular piece of metal on the throwout bearing as well as some
spacer stuff that was all munched.  Things I would check on before
reinstalling the engine are 1) the clutch disc (it might work now but how
much wear is left?  3 months, 6 months, a year? - wanna pull the engine
again in that amount of time?  No?  Replace it...) 2) flywheel
seal/endplay/camplug area and back of case for leaks or seepage 3) pressure
plate and throwout bearing (obviously you've taken care of this one.)  4)
are the spring clips holding the bearing securely in the throwout arms?  If
that bearing can even jiggle the slightest bit, they are worn  5)  How's the
side to side play in the cross shaft in the trans?  6)  Does your bowden
tube have the correct bend in it?  I didn't ask you if it had a bend to it -
I'm asking if it is the CORRECT amount of bend?  7)  Cable too long?  Look
in the RMMW catalog or Bentley for the correct length.  Pull your cable and
measure it.  Crack down and dig in and start eliminating all possibilities
because it's the one thing you are overlooking that is getting you -
everytime without fail.

I hope I don't come across as mean or condescending.  It's just that
sometimes when I get frustrated (and you all know how often that happens), I
just gotta bite the bullet, be agressive, and tackle the job no matter how
many limits my mind is setting for me.  I just have so set aside my feelings
of, &quot;I don't want to do this&quot; and &quot;I just pulled the engine - NOT AGAIN!,&quot;
and tear into things like an automaton - robot if you will.  I turn into a
human shortly after the job is done and I'm gratified that I did it right.
Many times I get so angry at how long it takes the tackle the problem but
everytime I walk away with experience that saves me a bunch of time on the
next job - one step closer to gurudom. :-)
