There has recently(last couple of years) been a setup created by a guy in
Everett Washington that allows you to attach a spin on Oil filter setup that
attaches to the stock oil cooler location and sticks out through the lower
front part of the Fan Shroud. I have not tried these, but they look pretty
slick. I don't recall the name of the guy or how to contact him, but my
local machine shop has them for sale, and he highly recommended it.
(Northwest Connecting Rod in Seattle). I have seen these in the VW
magazines, and apparently, according to the Machine Shop Owner, Several of
the larger VW suppliers are supposed to start carrying them soon.(I think
Empi).

I am not sure why these have not caught on much yet, but I expect it will.

Eric,
Seattle
