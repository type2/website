Subject: Re: [VB] knocking, and more friggen knocking!!

ok, that is friggen scary!! i will not even crank the
motor over now until it gets replaced. i dont have the
money to rebuild it, but yet i dont have the money for
a new or rebuilt longblock. all i have is about 100
bucks that my mom owes me. my bus was my only ride,
and my parents both work all day, so i dont even have
a job yet. 
 i really hate this motor.....
