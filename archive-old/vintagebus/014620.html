&lt;&lt; THEN, I'll have to pull the 1776 apart and see exactly what happened... I 
never heard any nasty noises when it quit, so hopefully nothing major got 
damaged. It will be a good time to put in new bearings, fix the mysterious 
oil leak, paint the tin, etc...

Hi David,
Do you know who or when this engine was built?  Sounds probable the cam gear 
was too big for your engine case.  We know of a type 3 freak up here that 
installed a +3 cam in an engine that required a -3 cam.  Resulted in a 30 
mile engine before needing a rebuild to install a new cam.
