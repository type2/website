&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Since you can't get more than you put in, less than 50 ft-lb will 
&gt;&gt; reach the nut . . .
&gt;
&gt;Ahh, now I see the confusion!  I go round this one with my students
&gt;every year!
&gt;
&gt;The difficulty is mistaking ft-lb of torque for ft-lb of work (energy).
&gt;Despite having the same unit, they are not the same thing!
 In any case, the shaft will start to rotate.  If
&gt;someone holds the other end of the shaft, they will feel the torque
&gt;you apply, as long as you apply it slowly as you would with a torque
&gt;wrench.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Ok, now I'm going to get a beer and let my brain cool off....  :)

 Well . . . . George is right people . . .   :-)

 What can I say . .  I been sick . . . :-)

 Basically . . if you read 50 on that gauge there will be 50 at the
nut no matter how wound up the extension is . . .

 What is stored in the extension wind up is potential energy that
will be bled off into your hands when you release . . .

 west    hey . . not my first mistake . . . :-)
