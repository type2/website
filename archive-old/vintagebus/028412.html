&gt; I'm sorry,
&gt; 
 but not only did you
&gt; advertise your mr2 on the bus list, you posted about it yet again.
&gt; 
&gt; this is NOT why i subscribe to this list,
&gt; 
&gt; thank you,

I have to second that feeling. 

I unsubscribed for a while when vintagebus turned into ebay-watch. Do we
really need all the ebay notices? Seems like there are enough posts
already.... and since we ask people to look at the archives before
posting questions, since they are capable of answering their own
questions without flooding the list-- isnt it also fair to ask that
folks do their own ebay-searching? I could sure do wihout the daily
&quot;good stuff? You decide&quot; posts.
