Subject: Backfire Help

Recently my bus started backfiring on the morning
start up.  I get =
in, push the pedal down once and turn the key.  It
starts right up with =
an immediate backfire.  Proceeds to run fine and if I
shut her off she =
will start right back up with no backfire.  Also get
no backfire when I =
start her up to go home from work at night.

Any ideas?

Thanks
