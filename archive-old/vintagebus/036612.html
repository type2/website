&lt;&lt; It's amazing how much list traffic is devoted to safety throughout the 
year;
 what type of tires to use, upgrading to dual-circuit master cylinders,
 seat belt installation, brake system, etc.  Then Jerome comes 'round
 and the sentiment is &quot;f*ck it, get the bus there any way you can&quot; &gt;&gt;

The post i made did not say that were putting the bus together unsafe.  We 
have been working on this single cab for the last few months non stop.  Just 
rebuilt the entire front end, brake drum to brake drum.  Rewired it front to 
back, new motor, new tires.  Basically everything is new except that he has 
not gotten the splitcase trans back yet.  Nor did I ever mention in any of 
the posts that we put together &quot;unsafe busses.&quot;  

There are a sad few who do practice that but I do not hear any of them 
posting to the list.

Going to Jerome and NOT just to get &quot;tanked&quot; but to meet people and have fun
