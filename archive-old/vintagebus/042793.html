Rex,

I've had to deal with this on my late loafs a couple of times...  my
solution was to go down to the hardware store and buy a medium size
utility hinge, drill and bolt it on.  With the later bus, I had the
advantage that I was dealing with a rusted hinge on a solid floor, but I
figure if you weld/pop-rivet in a piece of metal, you wind up in the same
place I started.  The bug hinges differently, at least from my bus, YMMV.

BTW, something I learned after doing this, that I have not yet had
time/occasion to implement, is that hinges come in a variety of
configurations.  Technically, the hinge you have is a &quot;loose pin&quot; hinge,
so the pin comes out on demand, and also so it can be lubed.  The cheap
utility hinges I bought were &quot;riveted pin&quot;  hinges.  A friend of the
theatrical persuasion told me that all stage sets are set up with a
utility hinge of the &quot;loose pin&quot; variety, so next time I do this job, I am
headed for my nearest community theater first to scope their hinges.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
