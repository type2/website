My oil pressure problems really hit the roof yesturday and today. Hot here 
in Oly WA, at least for us, 92. After bus is on freeway, pressure goes way 
down. Light comes on at idle, guage reads like 2 to 3 psi. Even at speed its 
like 10 to 15 psi. Tested guage and two senders with known air pressure, 
they work fine. Asked for assistance locally, was suggested to check 
regulator and bypass valves and springs. Pulled by pass, looks a little 
worn. Havnt checked regulator yet; I looked at my bentley and dont quite 
understand how this could matter. Worn oil pump? Was told that the CB Maxi 3 
is a good prodduct and though not new should not fail this badly. At cold 
start pressure gets about 40 psi at start, still low. Maybe it is the pump. 
Darn it. This low pressure seems related to temp. Engine seems hot, very 
hot, after driving. Drained oil out didnt seem burned but was foamy. Going 
to try 20w50. Might add external oil cooler, although I dont believe that is 
really the right approach. I think this is a high compression engine, but 
should still be drivable.
Yes timing and carb are adjusted ok for this motor.
What would you do?

1776 by the way. Dog house, dual port, modified carb (larger venturi).
