While trying to fit a new master to my 59 singlecab I have a problem
with the pushrod contacting the piston in the master before it makes
contact with the mounting flange by about a quarter of an inch.The
pushrod is set to length per Bentley,the pedal stop is so the pedal is
at full extension(pedal arm almost hits underside of floor)but still
contact.This happens with two different masters part numbers 211 611
011J ,one Varga,one Fag.Bentley states that 1mm. of play between pushrod
and piston.So what gives as this is a major holdup in my COMPLETE new
hydrulic and friction system.At this point I do not want to do the dual
circut conversion(time,money,redoing new stainless hard lines)

I am a bit confused here.  How can the push rod be set to length re Bently 
(1mm play) if it contacts 1/4inch before bolting in?    Try backing off the 
rod a bunch , installing the MC, and then setting the play in the rod.  Hope 
this helps.   Perhaps you set the play w/ the old MC, then put in a new stop 
, which was previously missing, while the old MC was out, and is all 
different now.  (?)
