&gt; Does anybody have some helpful hints on repairing a chip-up, 
&gt; crack, chunks 
&gt; falling off 1966 bus steering wheel?  I was planning to get 
&gt; some bondo fill 
&gt; it in and sand then paint it up.  Would this be a waste of 
&gt; time?  All help 
&gt; will be very greatfull

Somone will give you a better idea but I saw a steering wheel off a '37
chevy truck that had been done with bondo and some or other epoxy paint. It
looked pretty good to me.
