&gt; I have a problem when I step on the brakes or turn on the signal the only
&gt; thing that happens is the direction indicator in the speedo lights up. No
&gt; external brake lights or flashers. The fuses are OK, I have a new battery
&gt; and I installed a new flasher relay but that didn't help. Anyone had this
&gt; before?

Check yer grounds. Seems like most of the brake/tail/turn signal light
problems come back to bad ground.
Check the easy stuff first.
