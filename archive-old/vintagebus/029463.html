I have been trying to take pics of all the stuff I have and here's the latest
items.  I have 3 pics of each door, showing the front, back and the bottom of
each.

One pair of cargo doors from a 65 deluxe(white):

The front side cargo door is bare without the door lock, rods, or popout window.
$35.00
The rear side cargo door is is bare without the door lock or rods, but has a good
popout window.  $40.00

I also have one pair of doors from a 66 (?) camper.  Both have the crank-out
windows (panel van style) (green w/ white belt):

The front side cargo door is complete, less the door handles.  It is nearly rust
free, but does have a dent about 6 inches up from the bottom (ask for a pic).
The windows are in great shape.  $75.00

The rear side cargo door is also complete, less the inner door handle.  This door
is in great shape as are the crank out windows.  $75.00


Again, pics are available
