Bodywork question for y'all:

On my bus, the front 1&quot; or so of the cargo floor is a bit crusty, and I 
would like to remove the rusty part and weld in a new cargo floor section.  
I have noticed that this is a common rust area on busses.

Looking around at my options for sheet metal, Wolfsburg west sells the 
entire cargo floor sections, left and right sides.  I've heard these are 
quite nice, but the rust on my floors is limited to the foremost inch or two 
of the cargo floor.  A cargo floor patch panel is also available, it is 
about a foot wide, and maybe 4 feet long.  To use this panel, I would cut it 
into 4-5 6 inch long (front to back) sections and use them to patch this 
area.

What would be ideal is a patch panel that runs widthwise, instead of 
lengthwise.  Does anything like this exist out there?  The best thing would 
be to pick up tom mink's SC bed, and cut off the front foot or so and use 
it, but I'm not close enough to sacramento, and NQ and the other midwest 
listees would hate me ;-). Ideally, a widthwise patch panel would be long 
enough (front to back) to extend from the cab bulkhead to the first 
crossbrace.  What have all of you done to repair this area on your busses?  
Suggestions?
