&gt;rather than having a hitch attach where the bumper brackets bolt to the bus,
&gt;or to the bumper brackets, it is sturdier to have a tow hitch that extends
&gt;under the motor to the rear torsion tube, with a piece on the rear bumper
than
&gt;just keeps the tow ball from falling down.  This way you are towing with a
&gt;much stronger part of the bus.  

Remember, though, if it is only attached at the torsion tube and the
bumper, the bumper is carrying the majority of the tongue weight.  This is
probably OK for towing another vehicle with 4 wheels as long as the
attachment points are in a horizontal plane of the hitch mount, but if you
pull a two-wheel trailer or something that's off-line you might yank the
bumper down...

Many years ago now I pulled my 67 camper with a Ford station wagon down
I-24 at Monteagle, Tennessee; a near-vertical bit of highway -- tailgated
at 80 mph by 18-wheelers, an experience I would suggest you avoid.  Take
the blue highways, take your time -- it's only fun if you arrive in one piece.
