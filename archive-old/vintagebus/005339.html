Well I hate to do this but, I've got a baby on the way, and I still have 2
other bus's to keep me happy. So here is the skinny :

Hardtop non-walk-thru Westy. 69,000 original miles, replaced clutch and
added a dog house cooler, still driving with the governor on the carb.
Missing original curtains and child's cot, otherwise interior is in great
shape. Exterior needs rockers replaced both sides, and rock ding surface
rust. One fifty cent piece size rust needs metal replaced both sides of
engine deck lid.  Battery compartment solid as is front floors.  Rust
started under passenger front windshield. Stewart Warner gas Heater needs
fuel pump rebuild. Email me for pictures, and more info.  I'm asking $3000.
But we can talk.  If you know the great traveler, Charlie Ford ask him about
my bus, he's seen it.  I'm in central Wyoming where this bus has spent it's
whole life.    Ginger
