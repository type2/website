Subject: RE: [VB] rear bumper splash pan

All I need is one of the 5mm bolts that hold the splash pan to the
bumper bracket... with a 9mm head and nice 'Kamax' logo.  Extra special
thank yous for a few of the split washers that go with them.  I have all
4 of the 9mm nuts.  I can trade a not so perfect 9mm headed bolt and
cash for a nice one.

Hey, I just realized that the bolts that hold the fuel sender to the
tank are 5mm... but who knows if they can be found with a 9mm head.?????




&gt;&gt;Trivia, they switched from the 9mm headed 5mm bolts to ones with a 8mm
head at about the same time the 8mm bolts switched from a 14mm head to a
13mm one... around 1960.
