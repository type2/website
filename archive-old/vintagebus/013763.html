I still don't see why it's so hard to go to Radio Shack and buy a $6
   speaker and call it good. I guess for some people that would double the
   investment in their buses, but at least you'd have some cool toons while
   waiting for your friend with a f*rd pickup and 50 feet of rope to pull you
   home...

Hi, Thom and all,

There's not a thing wrong with that option.  In fact, another speaker might
sound better, who knows! (Although there were opinions to the contrary..
Eric&amp;Barb mentioned that the original Blaupunkt speakers sound the best...)

The sense of accomplishment of actually &quot;reconditioning&quot; a part successfully
and then tooling down the road with that part just working away knowing that
your handywork paid off and is actually working for you is much different
(IMHO) than buying a part and slapping it in there.  I just don't have the
same satisfaction, but that's just me.  Another little advantage to doing your
own reconditioning of a speaker (and other things) is that it gives you
something to converse about.  &quot;Wow, dude, you know what I did?  I used
FINGERNAIL POLISH to fix my speaker, dude! You wanna know how I did it?&quot;  And
if the other person is interested, (s)he'll say, &quot;You dang skippy I do!&quot;  And
then you go on and explain every sorted detail until (s)he thinks you're wierd
or something, or incredibly interesting.  (It's all a chance, but it DOES give
you something to talk about!)

There are lots of aftermarket parts out there just waiting for you to buy, and
actually it takes quite a bit of talent to buy the right combination of parts,
especially if you are building a racer of some sort.  But even if you don't
choose to tell anyone about your anal tendencies of trying to keep your bus
absolutely stock, at least you'll have the satisfaction of doing something
that not everyone else does for a change.  

All of this was predicated on whether you LIKE doing this sort of thing.  You
might get incredible satisfaction out of just replacing the speaker with new
aftermarket and call it quits!

I have a friend who just wants to customize EVERYTHING!  I like STOCK, STOCK,
STOCK!  I don't understand why he does what he does, but we're good friends!

I chuckled at an ending byline that a listmember apparently tacks on to all of
his messages: &quot;People who don't customize have no imagination.&quot; or something
to that effect.  This cannot be further from the truth.  There is art to both
realms.  Especially with vehicles that the parts are getting scarcer by the
minute for.  In many &quot;reconditioning&quot; efforts, invention and imagination are
your key tools of the trade.

I think I might have &quot;over answered&quot; your question!  And, of course, it is
just one man's opinion and I'm hoping someone out there thinks that I'm at
least partially &quot;correct&quot;!
