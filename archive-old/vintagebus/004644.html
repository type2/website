Today was quite the day on the 67 Deluxe in that I got a lot done.

Thanks to Frank Musil in Lincoln, I was able to drive the 40 some miles one
way to his house, pick up a set of swing axle boots, chat for a minute or 2,
and come home in about 2 and half hours.  Not long after arriving, a couple
of friends showed up looking for a partial Baja kit I was rumoured to have
and some beater 5 lug rims.  I was glad to finally get rid of that stuff - I
just gave it away because my space is worth more to me than money. :-)  In
return though, they promised me to give me the fenders, turn signals, and
anything else they remove from the project bug so that I can fill the voids.
:-)  They also helped me hook up the tow bar to the Suburban.  After bidding
them off, I picked up my sister from work and we headed for the car wash.
$3.00 later, a soaked scalp and coat later, I had the engine bay spic and
span clean.  I also took the opportunity to blast the tranny cross member
and area around the swing-axle boots off so that I could replace the boots
without worrying about a bunch of crap and gunk falling in the way.  Once
home, I disconnected the bus from the suburban, roped the tow hitch up so it
wouldn't drag and sent my sis inside to get my brothers to help me push the
bus up the drive.  In the meantime, I got it into position and the steering
wheel popped off. :-(  Turns out the wobbly steering wheel this bus had
(which I had suspected was a wallered out hub) was due to the retaining nut
being completely removed!!!  I hand tightened it back on just in time for my
brothers to push the bus back up the drive.  I chocked the wheels then
contemplated my next move.

I replaced the swing axle boots.
Removed starter, cleaned connections, re-installed starter
Installed firewall seal and seal in rear apron
pulled gas tank from 66 and prepped the 67 to receive it which included
gluing in felt pads and crimping extenders on the hold down straps to secure
my 71 baywindow gas tank
installed new throttle cable

That about did it.  Tomorrow I'll install the throwout bearing, gas tank,
lines, filler tube, battery, and then think about installing the engine. :-)
