Subject:  Safari Windows + cracking glass

the reason all the older aftermarket safaris crack the glass is because the 
frames are made wrong

Factory VW windows have a box cross-section on the outer edge which makes 
them strong......

if you just use a &quot;U&quot; channel it flexes too much

I think CE made them woth the box section........
