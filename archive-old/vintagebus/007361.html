Is this a subtle attempt at a flame? Funny how the only time you pipe up is
to run your mouth. Get a life man

&gt; &lt;&lt; Ok. I am tired of getting home after 12 hours of slaving for the
government
&gt;  and having 50 emails of everyone wanting the same parts. I like to help,
but
&gt;  I can't handle all this. I dont do this to make money, this is a hobby. I
&gt;  couldn't keep track of all these emails if I wanted to. Call me a pos I
&gt;  really dont care, I dont feel like putting up with it. Parts I promised
to
&gt;  Greg and Everett are going to them as I have been chatting with them from
&gt;  the get go. thatvwguy, the roof is yours if you still want it. Not that I
&gt;  haven't been chatting with anyone else, but I honestly (no offense)dont
&gt;  remember. I know I mustve promised that Berlin Tag to 3 different people.
&gt;  Its going up for auction. Plain and simple. If you are one of teh three
&gt;  people I told could have it, sorry. Like I said I can't keep up with it,
&gt;  especially that darn Berlin tag. I dont know what the deal is with that.
If
&gt;  you want it, bid on it. It'll be on ebarf tonight. I know I have been
&gt;  talking to you Steve, and if you email me again, I will try to square you
&gt;  away as well. There is one other person who wanted interior trim for $50
and
&gt;  berlin tag. You can still have the trim if you want it, but no tag. If
you
&gt;  dont want it, i understand. If I promised anyone else any parts, and you
&gt;  really need them, email me again and I'll try to help. Anyone else, sorry
&gt;  but I can't help unless your bus is broke down for this part or
something.
&gt;  Whatever is left I will have my wife ebay for me. Everyone mentioned
please
&gt;  email to my aol addy. Sorry if I pissed anyone off. Dont flame me, I'll
&gt;  delete. I dont want to hear it. I'm not a business and dont need anyones
&gt;  money. You dont like me, put yourself in my shoes. This has just been way
&gt;  too much. I understand when you need parts, but damn, there must be 1000
&gt;  lurkers on this list all looking for early parts. ..then again, I guess
&gt;  there probably is. Anyways, good luck with all of your searches, and I
&gt;  apologize once again if I can't follow through with any deals.
