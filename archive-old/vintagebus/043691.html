Subject: Doc project temporarily down
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10104202040150.5859-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

All,

While the doc project index HTML files were on CWRU's server, the
large graphics files were on NBCi.  The fokkers at NBCi have decided
to mess around with things, so the links to the pictures from the
index pages currently aren't working.  We are trying to get it
fixed but it may be down for a few days.  Sorry for the
inconvenience.

Matt Roberds
