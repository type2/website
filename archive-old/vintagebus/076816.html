Subject: Re: [VB] bbbrake adjustments

This is why a guy should take the time to radius the shoes prior to
installing them--
The contact area willbe 100 % right from the get go--and you'd ony have
to re- adjust them after a day or two--and then that's it--

Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message   
 
Any brake job that replaces the brake shoes will if daily driven, have
to be adjusted two or three times in the first month due to the shoes
wearing into the circumferance of the drums. Take two empty cans, that
one just fits inside the other to get a visual idea of a newly installed
shoe. With the inner can pushed over inside they touch only in a small
area. Failure to adjust the new brakes and even keep adjusted old brakes
results in only the edges of the shoes nearest the slave cylinders
touching when braking! Eric&amp;Barb
