Emmett,

Think I am gonna make this one. Wife says she won't attend anymore vw
thingies busless. I have been working hard on the 66 Westy. I know I can
have it running but not sure if all systems will be safe for a two hour
trek. Hopin someone near me (Edgewater or Annapolis, MD) will be coming
too so we can carabus.

Really excited because I have been getting much done and have a new
source for free parts. A guy down the street says he will even paint it
for me. That may not be done before departure. . . I just dom't know.

Les
