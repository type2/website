Subject: bolt specs

  I have a motor im working on (the stock sp for the 67 delux) that has 
apparently the bottom two (mounting) bolts (you know the two poking out you 
use to put the motor in) that are apparently damaged. I got new studs, they 
dont really go in right or take any tourque (whichi is probably why they 
were missing, yeesh). Are these 8mx1.0 pitch holes (in helicoil or timesert 
terms)?. Which is better for this application. (i want to drill both out and 
redo them). I found a timesert kit that has 8x1 thats only 11mm long tho, i 
think this is the only thing offered (nothing longer). is there a step stud 
available for this? I dont have a quality tap and die set, id like to either 
buy the time sert or helicoil kit and have what I need to do it. thanks

p.s. looked in archive a bit more. seems i need 68-71 tank. i can find that. 
Seems wolfgang int (maybe ronnie too?) has a new 67 tank for $100. (but not 
the later one). The restore kit from POR and Eastwood is $50 plus ship. Im 
not dying with this bus, I could put a repop tank in it (and would for the 
extra $50) if its workable for at least a few years.  thoughts and opinions 
welcome.
