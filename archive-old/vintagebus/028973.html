&gt;I was under the impression the only 51 bus still around was in the VW 
&gt;factory not driving around in the middle of nowhere.
&gt;Guess I read the plaque wrong.
&gt;
Nah, there's a couple '51s in AZ.  Last time I thought about it, there were
about 15 Barndoor-era Buses in AZ.

Maybe you saw a '49 Prototype?

There's a few 50 Panels cruising around globally too.
