It's best to order direct, Old Volks will not be importing sheet metal for a
few months, due to the high import and shipping charges to this country, at
this time I would not be able to sell sheet metal at a reasonable price.

ps. the sheet metal will still be listed in my online catalog for reference
and for future sales.
