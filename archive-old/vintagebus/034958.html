I practice the one strike and your out policy.  One bad experience and I 
won't deal with that person again.  I think honest people always bend over 
backwards to make things go 100% smooth.  If something was less than smooth 
without a reasonable explanation, chances are you don't want to deal with 
that person.  For example, I tried buying some *advertised* parts I really 
needed from a guy over the Internet.  Told him I would pay his asking price 
and send 100% payment for parts and shipping if he would send me a picture.  
He couldn't find the time to send the picture and when I offered to have an 
acquaintance who lives only minutes away from him come look at, pick up, and 
pay for the parts in question the seller was for some reason never available. 
 Something sounds shady to me....

Best part is now he wants to buy some stuff from me.  Ha!  What a short 
memory!  What do you think his chances are?  8-)
