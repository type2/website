Yes they do have the Lemerz logo on them.  and month year stamp. and an extra 
number I don't know what that is.  maybe made later as replacement.  like VW 
kept making 36hp bus mufflers after they stopped selling buses with them. 

Anyway, not much use for a splitty

&lt;&lt; If they were dated in 65 they would not be factory chrome 356 wheels as 
they
 went to the small 5 Porsche pattern in 64. If they are Porsche (real) they
 would have a manufacturer stampong and a month year date stamped in them.
 The early Brazilian (Mangle) Porsche chrome wheels had a date of manufacture
 stamp with no company stamp.
