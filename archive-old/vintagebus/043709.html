&gt;Finally got the new engine installed last night...I went to try and start it
&gt;and nothing...

This is your '65, right?

&gt;the headlights do not work. when i turn the key the red and green lights do
&gt;not come on.  The turn signal, flasher, dome lights, windshield wipers all
&gt;work.  all fuse are good(i think, no resistance in them)

Well, you at least have some power from the battery to the front (dome 
lights etc work).  Do any of the outside lights work (parking lights?)
Do the dash lights work - not the warning lights, the ones that light
up the speedo at night?  If none of this stuff works, then you probably
have a wrong connection at the fuse box.  There should be two relatively
fat red wires on the same end of the rightmost fuse - one of these brings
the juice from the battery and the other sends it to the headlight
switch and ignition switch.  It sounds like the wire to the headlight
and ignition switches is not hooked up right.

If all that is OK, the next place I would look is the ignition switch.
Step on the brakes and turn the key on - do the brake lights come on?
Does your fuel gauge show signs of life?  If OK on both, your ignition
switch is probably OK, but if not, it may be suspect.  If the fuel gauge
works but not the brake lights, you may still have something wrong at
the fuse box - check the connections to the second fuse from the right.

&gt;i admit i forgot how the wires go to the coil, and as a little off on 
&gt;the new carb.

You should have about four wires from the rest of the car to the
engine.  There will be a fat red one and a skinny one (not red)
from the voltage regulator to the generator.  There will be a green
or green/blue stripe one that goes to the oil pressure switch, and
a black one for the coil and carb.

The black wire from the wiring harness should go to the + terminal
on the coil.  There will be another wire that also connects to the
+ terminal on the coil and goes over to the choke on the carb,
and possibly also runs to the cut-off jet on the carb (which you
may or may not have).  This wire is the &quot;run&quot; output of the
ignition switch.

The wire coming out of the distributor (usually green) should go to 
the - terminal on the coil.  This is the *only* wire that should
be hooked to the - terminal.

Good luck!
