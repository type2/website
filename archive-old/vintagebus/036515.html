Subject: Torsion tube tranny mount question
To: &quot;'vintagebus mailing list'&quot; &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt; (us-ascii)

I am looking at a 1958 bus that has had the mounting ring/support for the
forward transmission mount torched off to convert to a latter style tunnel
case transmission. The tranny is now supported by some sort of strap style
mount that goes around the transmission and clamps to the two chassis horns.
I would like to restore the bus and reinstall the correct split case style
tranny. Is it possible to section and replace the center of the torsion
tube? Any recommendations or experience would be helpful.

Thanks,
Paul
