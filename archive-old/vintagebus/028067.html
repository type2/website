Subject: Re: [VB] (friday) the truth about our VW's

I had to run to the VW dealer to pick up a part last year, and decided
to take my bus. I parked right beside the garage door, with the safaris
wide open...

A couple of the techs came out to check out my bus. &quot;What is THAT?&quot; one
of them asked.

&quot;That's a REAL VW, &quot; the other one said.

VWoA has a little monthly promo mag that goes out to the dealers. We've
been getting them the last few months, I think because the boss bought a
y2k bug. I noticed that they have a few little articles about vintage
bugs (probably to help push their new bugs), but I haven't yet seen any
articles about vintage buses. I figure it is because they don't have a
modern version to sell.
