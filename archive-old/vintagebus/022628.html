I think the SoCal people, and probably west-coast people in general, have a
higher opinion of what their buses are worth relative to the rest of the
world.

But it's not us armchair quarterbacks that determine bus prices; it's the
people that buy them, or don't buy them.  Maybe someone will step up and
buy the $1700 hooptie.  Maybe someone won't.

As an aside, I don't see ebay as being a good venue for selling cars (or
real estate, which they do!); ebay (to me) seems better suited for impulse
purchases.  The average person (rex excluded) doesn't buy a car on impulse.
