Subject: generator differences

I am in the process of replacing my generator in my 1960 kombi.  There is some severe wear on the windings where the brushes touch.  Almost like a gouge.  There is alos alot of pink like dust around the generator that appears to be coming from within the generator.  Are there differences in generators (6v) between say 1960 and 1966? (dimensions, output, length ect.)  Would I be better getting a rebuilt generator from one of the parts houses, or having mine rebuilt locally?      

Thanks
