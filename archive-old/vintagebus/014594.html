Subject: Re: [VB] Blaupunkt History/ Installed Factory Radio

Just one more data point on the radio discussion.

I think VW might have had some general specifications including how the
radio was to look that they gave to various manufacturers then let them go
after it making the radios.

I have two VW Emden III am/fm/lw radios.  They look exactly alike on the
front - faceplate and all.  They are however completely different behind it
and one is made by Blaupunkt and the other is by Grundig.  Both have
stickers on them identifying them as Emden III models.

FWIW,
