Subject: RE: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

Based on my past experience you may be putting on the hub too tight.  I
toasted a bearing on my right side for the very reason.  I found that there
is a bit tricky to get right; an old VW mechanic showed me what it should
feel like.

There is a minimal amount play (Andy mentioned that it was .001-.005&quot; of
axial movement) required.  I had a heck of a time gauging what it was until
I actually &quot;felt&quot; it.

Good luck!!
Rich


&gt;I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that
&gt;I can still move the washer with a bit of force.
