Subject: Jerome Raffle Bus

I haven't heard anybody yet say anything about the raffle bus.  Who won it?
Did they raise a good amount of money?  How did the bus look?


&gt;I have some pics, mainly caravan and ppl coming over mingus on Sun.  I just
&gt;woke up and now have to go to work.  I drove straight through yest and got
&gt;home at abt 3am.  Had a great time.  Can't figure out why they separated the
&gt;rack and ladder though.  Will post the pics when I get a chance.  Anyone get
&gt;any pics of the slow drags?
&gt;
&gt;
