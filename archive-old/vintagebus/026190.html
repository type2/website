Subject: [VB] 30 pict troubles
Message-ID: &lt;382B470C.7310D9DE_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Was out playing with carbs tonight and now need some good advice.

I fixed a plugged accelerator pump and nozzle and checked to see that
all the jets and passages were clear and clean.  I installed and
adjusted the choke. Upon starting the motor (1600 SP, 009 dist.) it
would only run while pumping the accelerator pedal.  It won't idle no
mater what I do.  It  really won't run at any constant throttle
position...I have to be pumping it to keep it running.  Any
suggestions??

BTW the motor has been running OK with a 31 PICT (but with the huge flat
spot), I just wanted to go back to the simpler carb to try and get rid
of the hesitation.  If the 30 won't work, I do the mods that people
posted about last week to the 009/34pict combo.  Thanks for any help.

On another note does anyone have a vacuum advance dist in good condition
that would work on this 1600 SP?  I also need a dome light switch (that
is mounted on the speedo pod) in good condition.

Steve
