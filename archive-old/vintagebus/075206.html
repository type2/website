Subject: Steering wheel

I posted that when I got my bus back after doing the tie rods that the
steering wheel was turned the wrong way, so the divider blocked the odometer.
I told my &quot;ace-mechanic&quot; about it and of course they promised but didn't fix
it.  If I unscrew the bolt, is it as simple as turning the steering wheel ??

Also, last week when I was driving down the road, the horn button just popped
off - shot in the air and landed on my lap.  Thought I would have a heart
attack because I didn't see where it came from or what it was for a few
seconds.  Then the insides of the horn button were just hanging there by the
wire.  TELL ME IF I AM BEING TOO PICKY but .. When the Ace's worked on my bus,
I guess it was bothersome for them so they just tore the wire and the button
insides out and put it in the back in my parts-box.  Even though the horn
didn't work [ I am not sure there is a horn under there, I haven't looked, but
will] won't the fact that they pulled it out, wire and all .. make it that
much harder for me to install a horn now that the wire is gone ?? I don't know
how hard it is to feed a new one through the hole ..

SORRY .. so many questions and complaints.
