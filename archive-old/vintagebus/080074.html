Yo Dave--

2400 miles round figure's --at an average of $2.20 per gallon of regular
is $576.00.
And I'm figuring somebody with a big block pick up--/ Straight job--will
swallow more.
No oil--no time, no depreciation figured, no tires--not much built in
for a breakdown tolls, whatever--

I'd be locating the folks you got ahold of that bailed-- for a geester--

That's one hell of a deal--

And I don't think you'll find anyone to do it any cheaper--

A commericial carrier ( owner operator ) gets $1.25 per mile.

The best that you can do is find a guy that's stuck in Fla. with a semi
and a flat bed--that'll has to get back home--

He'll do it for almost fuel costs---but figure that a semi gets 6--to 8
mpg---

Call a local truck brokerage.

I don't think your gonna get this done for that price--

E-mail message   
 
Yeah, $1000 is slightly low, but not necessarily for the average Joe
driving across country on his own. 
My quotes were around $1000-$1200 from legit transport companies. 
Dave
