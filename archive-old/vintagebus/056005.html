Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Question

&gt; &gt; &gt; If it has reduction boxes, it would *have* to be a bus trans,
&gt; &gt; &gt; unless it was in some sort of baja or something!

No, actually you can take a bug center section, reverse the R&amp;P, and stick
the bus axle tubes on it and run it in a bus. Rebuilt center sections that
are &quot;supposedly&quot; for a bus are sometimes sold this way.

I already know that the used trans came out of a bus. What I don't know is
whether it has a bus center section or a bug center section with a reversed
R&amp;P.
