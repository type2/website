Subject: Re: [VB] speedo vs. tire size

Am I going to have a disparity in my speed reading by using a 62 speedo
in a 67 ?
--------------------- Clip -----------------------
You have to check the number of revs per mile on each speedometer.
That should give you a good idea but we already know that 62s didn't run
PR195-14 so you can count on it being wrong no matter what the revs per
mile number is.
I gave up on VW speedometers a long time ago and watch my tach as I click
off mile markers holding a constant speed. I simply run close to the
appropriate rpms for a certain speed and accept what comes.
Since everybody else speeds, I just stay behind them and haven't had a
speeding ticket since 1987 and then it was on a BMW bike.
