First of all sir: You don't have the right to tell anyone on this list to
&quot;shut up&quot;.

Secondly; your command of the english language is so uneven that your
posting is
all but incomprehensible.

Thirdly; the fact is that the very situation you railed against has
happened.

Above all, we treat our fellow listees with respect. I'm not the list
administrator, but I am a member in good standing and as such I feel
compelled to speak out against your language and demeanor.

You owe all of us, and JP in particular an apology.
If you're not man enough, or literate enough to deliver one then I suggest
you keep your
opinions to yourself.
John Flowers
