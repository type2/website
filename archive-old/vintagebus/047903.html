As for lowering, small tires look soo bad!  Small tire and huge wheel gap.
What you need to do is, since you have a balljoint beam, you will need to have
adjusters installed, either buy them from Bus Boys, or Gene Berg. If Gene,
thats what the fellas around here use, ask for the Avis adjusters. The curve
isn't exactly the same as the bus beam, but is real close, won't notice after
you get a good bead of weld around it. You could buy spindles as mentioned
earlier in this program, but........not for balljoint beams!
  
For the back, absolutely do not lower with reduction boxes, you will strip out
your stub axles due to the extreme angle. Instead, order a rear axle kit from
Bus Boys or Wolfgang. You will also need to find axles and brakes from a type
3 or late swing axle beetle from a shop or yard. If you are using your bus
tranny, the ring gear will indeed need to be flipped, if a beetle or type
three, do not flip, make sure you read the instructions that will come with
the rear end kit. That is a basic run down on what to do. 
  
As for bearings? I have no idea what they are talking about, I have never had
that problem. And the Corvette tire thing, you didn't say you wanted to do
that, did you? And I know buses are workers, Mark and I came back from Buses
on the Blue RIdge, in his lowered 64, the bus was packed and the roof rack
loaded, 15 hour trip, no problems!
                            
                                                   Mike
                                                Das Kool Bullis

P.S. I would rather see a lowered bus, than a cut bus.
