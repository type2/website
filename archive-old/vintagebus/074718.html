Karl!
   Where have you been?  I've not seen you respond in a while.  I was trying 
to help out Tom.  See his question below.  Take care.

Ok,

So I got my new VR for the 74 bug engine / motorola alt.  in my '58 panel.
The brand on the VR is beck/arnley. It's black with a plug coming off it 
with
4 wires attached.  The wires are blue, green, red and brown.  Does anyone 
know
if this is the right VR and perhaps where the wires go, seeing as I do  not
have the other half of the harness?  The part number on the box is 177-0653
or 51-33002  it is marked with a 2HA 1794 on the VR itself.  Any help would 
be
great.
