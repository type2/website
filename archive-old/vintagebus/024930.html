 I have recently noticed that Rosie's oil pressure is way too high (above 80
 psi) at highway speeds. I suspect that one or both of the pressure relief
 pistons are stuck. I could use some coaching on removing and checking them
 out. All suggestions welcome.
  &gt;&gt;
what  weight oil are you using?   I use a heavier oil in summer than winter, 
but if it gets cool before the regular scheduled oil change the oil pressure 
gets high, so I swap to a thinner oil.

checker pressure relief valves is simple.   You shimmy under the engine, and 
look for the one or two big screwed plugs under there- in dual relief one is 
forward the other aft.  I put the vise grips on the real wide fat screwdriver 
to undo them, and an oil bucker with help catch the drips and springs.  Not 
much oil comes out, but some does.  *-O
