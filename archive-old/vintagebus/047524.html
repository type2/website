Yeah, we've all seen that already. Needs a good coat of Dove blue.

Yeah Mike, Do like I did on the kombi; take a piece of broken off bondo 
covered with dove blue down to Ace Hardware. They'll match up a batch of 
lacquer on their computer. Use a small roller not a brush. (better coverage) 
Also prep with a wire brush rattle can rust converter for those bad spots. 
Maybe you can pass the state safety check and drive that puppy 100k like this 
karma bus did. 
OR, you can drive it on sunny days and sell it in with that primo $5,000 pant 
job to the Japanese because you need the money a divorce settlement. Some 
women are jealous of Show Queens...

jus kidding

shaka brah,
