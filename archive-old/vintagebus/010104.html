Unfortunately, there's a lot more to be concerned about than simple &quot;salt
water&quot;.

In 1984 some boats moored in a local industrialized waterway were damaged by
a City contractor, and among the repairs was replacement of lots of
stainless steel rails and other fittings.  The job was done using top
quality marine stainless, yet by the time all was completed much of the
stainless was already corroded.  Some of the corrosion was from &quot;salt spray&quot;
splashed up from the waterway, and some was from airborne nastiness.

In one case a box of new stainless fittings was lost overboard by accident,
along with a box of expensive tools.  The rigger hired a diver to retrieve
the fittings and his tools from the bottom of the waterway.  When returned
to the surface after ~48 hours submerged, the stainless steel fittings
looked like Swiss cheese.

Granted this is a worst case scenario, but the point is that there's a lot
more splashing around under your bus than just salt water.  It's all the
other corrosive crud in the mix that exacerbates the damage, and even an
all-stainless vehicle isn't immune.

Maybe we could convince Delorean to retool his old plant to build
all-stainless replica Type 2s, factory encapsulated in Teflon or some other
space-age miracle goo :)

FWIW

ocean for a thousand years without any apprieciatable corrosion.  &lt;&lt;
