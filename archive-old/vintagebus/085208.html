Subject: Need some brakelight help.

Got tags for the Bus today and now my brake lights done work.  here's; what
I've tried so far:

Checked ground at taillights, ground is good

Turn signals work and taillights, and hazards lights.

Got under the Bus and have power to the brakeligth switch.  Do power going out
when pressed. tried jumping the wires across and no lights come on.


At 9 pin box, I run power to pin 54 and no lights come on.

I hook up power the wire that runs to 54f on the 9 pin box and the lights come
on.

I run wire from 54 to wire from 54f and no lights.  Shouldn't they have at
least lit up the lights?

It's a dual circuit master cylinder.
