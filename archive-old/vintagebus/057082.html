Subject: Westy Spice rack

I recently redid the spice rack in my westfalia and
was curious about something. I just saw one sell for
$160.00 on ebay! Too much for me so I remade the four
thin panels on my rack that were damaged. I seems to
me that these panels are the biggest problems on these
racks because they are always broken. I made mine
about 1/16 thicker so it is stronger. I cut some extra
and was wondering if there was any interest in them.
They are made from the original material and are cut
so that the grain pattern faces the correct way (Hello
type A personality!)and they have not had the holes
drilled to mount them or the finish sanding done. That
will give you the option to take them down to factory
thickness, if you so desire. I haven't thought of a
price yet but it is a little labor intensive to take
them down to the desired thickness. I should have a
set or two at BYOB if anyone wants to take a look. I
am also working out the kinks on a door mounted stove
that looks like it could have been a Westfalia item.
It is only slightly larger than the spice rack (width)
and requires no additional holes to be drilled to
mount it. It uses the original style mounts that are
on the spice rack.
