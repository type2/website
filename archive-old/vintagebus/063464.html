&gt; Dumb question. What is the difference between the air hoses leaking and with turning on the heat
&gt; with correctly fitting hoses?

Wild guesses:  1.  Instead of useless air being blown where you don't
need it, when you have the &quot;heat&quot; on you are bringing air away from
the engine compartment, which contributes to cooling.

2.  You do not do this when the ambient temperatures are high, so
perhaps it is less a problem in the winter?

3.  The heat exchangers should still keep the pressure high inside
the shroud; this might not be the case with open hoses.


Again, these are only my uneducated guesses.
