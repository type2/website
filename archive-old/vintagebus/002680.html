No, it had the original door with the bumper on it when I shipped it to WCC.
They must have welded over the hole.In all fairness, there were at least
20 holes that the PO's had drilled into the bus that needed welding.Tony
must have gotten a little over zealous with his welder.He's used to deluxes
 and micro resto's not mere panel trucks. :-)
    Like Thom said, it not a big deal to fix.



&gt; If the door was ever replaced, then they probably didn't drill a new hole
&gt; and put in the captive nut.  Shouldn't be a big deal to retro-fit it now.,
