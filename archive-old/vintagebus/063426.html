Subject: Things you can't do with a fuel-injected car

So on Wednesday afternoon I was running some errands and enjoying the
sun in the Bus, when I drive by a lady in an early 90s Oldsmobile
sitting on the side of the road with its four-ways on.  I pull around
and ask her if she needs help.  She says she's out of gas and that
a friend of hers should be getting off work soon to come help.  I
ask if she'd like a ride to the gas station and she agrees -- then
opens the trunk to get her gas jug.  Apparently, this isn't the first
time this has happened to her.

Once I see the jug I offer to fill it up on the spot.  She was kind of
curious as to how I was going to do this.  I have about 2' of spare fuel
line in the Bus.  I pinched off the line between pump and carb, pulled
it off the pump, hung the end up high in the air so it wouldn't drip,
and put my long hose from the pump outlet to the gas jug.  Started
the engine and let it run on the float bowl contents - it ran for about
one minute and pumped about 0.25 gal of gas.  Hooked the carb back up,
refilled the float bowl, and did it again - three times in all to get
about three-quarters of a gallon into her jug.  Dumped it in her car
and she got fired right up - I followed her to the gas station, about
a mile away, to make sure all was well, and she made it just fine.

It's kind of fun when you can fix somebody's ~10 year old car with
your ~39 year old car.  :)  OTOH, before I bought the new battery
a couple of weeks ago, my bus was the recipient of pushes and jumps
from the drivers of later-model cars, so it all works out.
