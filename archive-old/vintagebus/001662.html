Today was the big day - I drove my bus. :-)

I started out by snagging one of the fellas from work for about 10 minutes
to help me lift the engine into the trailer so I could power wash it.  I
also cleaned the floormats at the carwash using soap, engine clean green,
and the final high power rinse.  After I drove back to the shop, the
neighbor guy across the alley offered to help me get the engine out of the
trailer and on to the cart.  Dave Bishop is his name and he's cool.  He used
to race stock cars years ago and I well remember hearing him fire up the
racer late at night.  Sometimes it griped my grandparents but Dave's a good
neighbor and they never said a word.  I sure could use a few more good
neighbors like Dave around my place.  They're the kind that mind their own
business but if you see each other in the alley, you've always got a little
something to say, a binding offer to help, or some neat little story to
tell.

I spent a good portion of the afternoon putting the engine in by myself.  I
put in a new rear rubber seal, put the voltage regulator back in (since my
alt. equipped 1776 is still on the stand), hooked up the PITA clutch cable
and adjusted it, hooked up all the wiring and all that stuff that goes along
with an engine installation.  Courtesy of Don Boneau, I installed the Berg
temperature dipstick although this one came from the Pamona swaps from the
guy who sells them to Berg.  (Don't tell anyone I told you that.) :-)

About the time I wanted to fire up the bus and go for a spin, the neighbor
kids showed up on their bikes.  They biked a mile to see what was going on.
I told them to hop in and throw their bikes on top of all the spare parts,
the welder, tools, etc.   I fired up the bus and after a few seconds, she
came to life.  I drove out of the shop but first gear was bogging really bad
and I thought I had something seized up like maybe a bad bearing or a locked
brake shoe but that wasn't it.  We got about a block down the road and I
just couldn't get going - darn near killed the engine when I realized, I
only had 3rd and 4th gear!  I pulled over, threw on the ebrake (engine still
running), told my passengers to give me a minute.  I ran to the back of the
bus, grabbed the 13mm socket along with the ratchet and extension, and ran
to the front.  I threw up the floor mat, loosened the shifter bolts, slid
the shifter all the way to the right, tightened it down, threw the wrench in
the parcel tray (now I know what that tray is for!), threw the mat back
down, hit first gear and we were off - my maiden voyage!  I was parading
through town and people were staring, friends slugging friends saying, &quot;Hey
look at that!&quot;, and lots of stares like, &quot;What is that?&quot;  :-)

By the time I cruised the town, got fueled up, gave rides, etc. I had logged
about 45 miles driving!!!  I gave my teenage friends Shawn and Adam a ride,
then came my infamous sister, then my workmate Jim, my mother, and my
grandfather.  I offered to let my grandfather drive and he said, &quot;Well when
you get it fixed up a little more and it's daytime, I'll try it out.  He
kind of smiled and laughed so he really enjoyed the ride.  The last time he
rode in one was back in the late 50's early 60's in Mr. Bell's dove blue
single cab.  :-)

I now have a bug-spackled front end, several flies stuck to my arms, and a
major case of the bus travelies.  These things are just awesome to cruise
in.  Everyone except my grandfather sat there and said, &quot;This is just way to
cool - this is awesome, etc. etc.&quot;  I think my grandfather basically said
the same thing but just in a different way. :-)

Things I noticed about the bus were that I need to adjust the steering box a
little tighter and the freeway flier trans is just AWESOME!  It takes a bit
longer to get up to speed but man with this 1600DP, I can cruise and not
feel limited like I always did in my 71 Westy.  Temp was about 180 the whole
time judging by the position of the Berg temp dipstick.  The 6v sapphire
radio is loud enough to drown out the engine.  It was absolutely great
cruising around while listening to an old 6v radio playing the Dolenz lawyer
program.  I also have a wiring glitch that causes the front left turn signal
to come on with the brake lights and an occasional tripping of the lo/hi
beam relay from hi to low with me not doing anything other than turning the
steering wheel.

I have yet to put the belly pan on, clean out the tools, put on the rear
bumper, and fabricate the trailer hitch.  I notice a slight tendency to pull
to the right when driving.  I have about 1/8&quot; toe-in and the guru told me to
have it professionally aligned.  This might not be a bad idea.

To finish the night off, I called the PO of the bus and she was extremely
happy that I called and gave her a report.  She's looking forward to my
visit so she can ride in the bus again.  She told me that just a week ago, a
guy and his nephew drove about 30 miles to see if she had her bus for sale.
I told Judith that I can't figure out why this bus sat in her front yard out
in the open since June of 96 and it wasn't until 3 and half years later that
it sold.  Her explanation?  &quot;I guess it was just meant to be.&quot;  I tend to
believe her.  :-)

I'll still have more updates to post - the headlights are sorely out of
adjustment and there's plenty more work ahead but the sheer joy of cruising
in a bus that might be the only one on the road in this county is something
that words can't describe.  Thanks for reading...
