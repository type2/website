it.  Thanks.

&gt;
&gt;I'm trying to find one of those &quot;rear hatch locking sticks&quot; (for lack of a
&gt;better name) that I saw auctioned at Jerome Jamboree 98.
&gt;
&gt;It is a device that allows you to leave your rear hatch open about 8 inches
&gt;but still have some security by locking the hatch to the bus.  If anyone
has
&gt;one for sale or can get me in touch with the gentleman who makes them (in
&gt;the Arizona area maybe?) I'd really appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
