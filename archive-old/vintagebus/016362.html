Sounds mostly right, from my readings (aka &quot;I've not done this myself
yet&quot;).  However, there's no need for the gray primer, unless you
really happen to like gray.  The POR-15 makes a fine primer itself,
assuming you paint it before it gets too hard.  I would point out that
normal primers are not water proof, so are actually somewhat worse
than not doing anything.  With an underlayer of POR-15, that shouldn't
matter so much, though.
