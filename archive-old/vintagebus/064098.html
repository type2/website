Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights - update

To be honest I have not inspected the front wires yet. The ones cracking are in the engine
compartment.... so oil might of done some damage. For now though I have no other problems to deal
with - lights are OK, engine runs.... I'll take care of all those little things later.

Thanks.... and if anything I might replace wiring completely... and will take care of the wiper
motor when I get to replacing the nose skin.... easier done when it's off...

peace,

Dre

| Sounds like you'ld probably want to remove the wiper motor and regrease it.
| The motor in my 61 got noisy.   The grease inside was almost solid.   New
| grease quieted it down.  The one in my 65 just moaned in pain, after greasing
| it moves smoothly and almost silently. (both have voltage drops)
|
| sucks about the wires cracking- but you still might want to check a wiring
| diagram.   Hell, if it is cracking everywhere that bad you might want to get
| a new wiring harness.   I mean, oil does do the plastic in, so the wires
| crack if they were oily a lot, and I;ve often seen cracked wires in the
| engine compartment.  But cracked wires up front?   Ouch.   I think this is
| the only time I've recommended getting a new harness, usually people when
| think they need one things are hooked up wrong and/or bad grounds &amp;
| connections.   But 40 years of outgassing in the heat might have done yours
| in.
|      I wonder if applying glycerin would help.  It really helped the non
| flexible real vinyl leatherette seats in my 53 that had been in hot E WA for
| 40 yrs become supple.
