&gt; What is everybody's view on either disconnecting the choke or leaving it
&gt; hooked up.
&gt; I have heard that the choke on fast idle can do horrific things to a 1600

&gt; because of the high revs. I have had mine unhooked ever since the last
&gt; re-build. Going on the whole &quot;warmitup&quot; thing you dont really have to
worry
&gt; I guess.
&gt; It is good practice to warm the engine of course, but having a choke at
&gt; least stops you from having the motor stall out at every stop sign or
&gt; traffic light.
&gt; Just wanted to hear a few opinions about it,
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andrew
&gt;
I have my choke hooked up. I dont really want to respond to that, rather I
want to say that I dont warm up. Nope dont do it. Seems like a good idea
&gt;from the onset, but I like to let my bus turn over for a very short time,
say 30 seconds or so, often less, then get going. I drive no hills, except
down, and use a half pedal or less. I am real conservative in my driving
until about 5 to 10 minutes have gone by then get a little more aggressive.
Why? Because I have noticed that my engine will take a long long time to
warm at idle, and I beleive that the VW causes more damage at idle cold. I
dont have anything to back this up with, except long life on my engines, but
without load the VW just seems to not like it much. Don't get me wrong, I
wait long enough to get oil pumping throughout, but I think any longer isn't
any  better then putting easy tension on all parts and then bringing them to
speed.
