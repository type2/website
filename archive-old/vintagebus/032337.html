Subject: More than 2 types of Restos
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.58.19991006221013.00963580_at_pop.primenet_dot_com&gt;

It was suggested that there were two types of restos. The quickie once over 
for a profit using the cheapest items and the Saint who does it for a 
keeper in spite of his soon to be ex-spouse. I agree with part of that 
explanation with a comment and an addition.
Comment:
Quickie once over is not a &quot;resto&quot; it is a freshening of the vehicle. A 
restoration is a meticulous return to factory quality. Not over done- but 
to factory specs.
Addition:
There are those who have been known to come real close to properly 
restoring a vehicle and then sell it for appropriate compensation or keep 
it. No one ever gets it 1000% correct. There is always something that falls 
short if you look close enough. It's fun and frustrating trying to come 
anywhere near the mark.
BTW: I know that I didn't come close but learned how much that I didn't 
(and still don't) know. The part I like is driving them.
