Ah freedom!  What a wonderful thing!

There was a study done in adjacent parts of Ohio and W. Virginia (Ohio
inspects, WV doesn't) comparing accident rates.  They found no significant
difference in accident rates due to mechanical or safety items.

You may feel safer with a sticker of approval from Big Brother, but it's
likely to be just an illusion!

I'm also leery of annual inspections, as they can be a step toward
&quot;clunker laws&quot; that make it difficult or impossible to drive the older
vehicles that we all love.  Remember, new car dealers and mechanics are
the biggest supporters of inspection and clunker laws.  They don't support
them because they love your VW!
