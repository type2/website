Subject: Re: [VB] KP - walking in

I drove my '62 Mouse Grey Standard to Kelley Park when I lived in CA from
Napa, totally rained the whole way down (nice day once we got in line
though) and intended to park inside with my club.  When I pulled up, the
guy at the gate asked me where I was showing.  I told him I was parking
with the club, he said, oh no you're not, park with the show cars.  I
parked over by the fire station, where the &quot;Luxury Type II's&quot; were. 
Well, I was the only standard!  But when I left, it was sure easy. 
Pulled right out and drove away.   Anyway.... there were plenty of beat
up and rusted cars in there.  There are so many places that aren't &quot;show
areas.&quot;  Really, that's what most of it is.  I'd encourage you to pull
in.  If you can handle the mile long line.  Definately get there early.
