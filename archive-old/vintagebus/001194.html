&gt;Doesn't anybody worry about the antique reduction boxes on our busses when
&gt;we're picking up a bus that hasn't rolled in ten or twenty years?  I never
do


You bet!  That's why before a long tow, I drain the boxes and the tranny and
replace the fluid with fresh but cheap gear oil.  There's always a risk when
you tow but there's always risk to most thing we do anyway however slight it
maybe.  It's kind of like getting cancer from walking down the street...
