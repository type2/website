Good,

This explains why I am finding a gas odor in cab.  I suspect there may be a
fume (air) leak at top of tank... perhaps at the sender or some rust area
(or one of the overflow /vent hoses often found on VW gas tanks).

One question... Does the '63 - 67 Bentley cover this (Double Cab tank
access)?  I looked in it and I saw only SC and standard Bus.  I did not find
the info you provide (that there is a panel behind the rear seat storage
area).  Just curious if I missed it...

The gas tank (at least on my 59 DC) can be reached by removing the rear 
bench and removing the two panels held in place by a few screws in the rear 
of the compartment.

There is a ton of space back there which should allow you to put a larger
aftermarket tank there.
