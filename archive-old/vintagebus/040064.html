&gt;I lieu of this currect discussion with the freeway flyer topic, I might 
&gt;suggest that anyone from now on who comes on here and asks about the 
&gt;freeway flyer trans be told they will need a high horsepower engine to run 
&gt;it. I like mine but it pretty much renders my bus in 3rd gear with any kind 
&gt;of a hill - even in Nebraska. I'm hanging on to my 67 trans because it 
&gt;might end up back in my 67 one of these days.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'd like to see the list pretty much agree on telling anyone from 
&gt;this point on no to run the flyer unless you have at least a 1900cc+ engine 
&gt;to pull it. I kind of wished that I had left my trans stock and ran tall 
&gt;tires like I had been repeatedly told by one of the listees (I think it was 
&gt;Eric and Barb) but not for sure.

well if this is true... im not gonna touch one! i got a big nut in the 
garage ill put in. it would seem my 1500 SP will never do the trick.
