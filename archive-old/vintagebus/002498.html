   Had to do this at the VW Classic last year. The old generator seized a
bearing while we were in line to get in. Removed belt and ran engine only to
move. After we got in our parts swap area Ronnie went around and found a new
generator and I asked afew people if they had ever removed the gen. with the
motor in, one guy had and gave me some ideas. Had the old one out in 30 mins
and new one in in another 30 mins. Motor was a 1600 duel port doghouse.
Heres the steps:

 Disconnect the battery and generator wires
 Remove air cleaner
 Remove carb, intake man, end castings
 Raise Cooling shroud and support with screwdrivers
 Remove generator stand
 Remove Generator
 Install in reverse order
