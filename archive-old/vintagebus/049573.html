I was poking at me gov the other day (say it in Cockney accent for extra
fun) and realized it is adjustable BUT the blue Bentley fails to tell you
how to do so... just a lil' ol &quot;see tech bulletin #K-10&quot; which SOMEONE here
would be happy to copy for me, right????

Right??


Dang. It look real cool on there, too!  I could disable it and still use
it, but breaking things for no good reason makes me shuddder.
