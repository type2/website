You could try some good old marlinespike seamanship stuff.  A good
source for this sort of thing is the Encyclopedia of Knots, found with
moderate difficulty in nautical bookstores or libraries.  The results
can be phenomenal!  You basically tie a buncha knots around the steering
wheel and then varnish over them.  I was on an old ship in California
that had it done in the Philippines and the wheel was truly awesome.
