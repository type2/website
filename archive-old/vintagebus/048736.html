Subject: Re: [VB] Friday post--a day late

I have a worse problem where I can't stay on the right path. For 
Example. I'll be working on some part of my bus. I head out to the 
barn where I've got some parts and other busses stashed. I look for 
the part I need. In the process I admire the busses out there. I 
notice some defect on one of the busses and start to think how I'm 
gonna address it. Next thing I know I'm out there with whatever tools 
I walked there with , just going at it.

Sometimes I just simply move to different parts of the original bus 
I'm working on. Either way, it gets me off the path I was on and 
keeps me from fininshing the immediate work at hand. I've identified 
this as the one of the reasons I have trouble getting bus things done 
promptly. I try to keep it from happening now. But it's hard.
