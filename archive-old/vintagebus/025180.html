Subject: Window cleaning, getting the grime off
Message-ID: &lt;3727C633.122FE6D_at_deltanet_dot_com&gt;

I have been cleaning and inspecting all my glass for the 65 Samba.
2Q's.

Does anyone know of a good cleaner that will get the years of grime off
the glass.  It is mostly a frosty dirt material right next to where the
rubber would be that i need to remove.  These are not the front window's
so i know it is not the laminate frost you can get.  this is years of
dirt/gunk that does not want to come off.

Also,  Anyone have any of the following pieces in good shape?

Rear side stationary window Glass
Front wing window Glass
Side pop out window Glass

I need one each w/o scratches

Thanks
