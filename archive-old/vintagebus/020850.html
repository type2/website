Subject: re: Fw: [VB] fuel flow problems 

I concur with Clara's suggestions. A neat trick in
deed.
A side note is that centuries ago I drove a '70 Ghia
vert which ended up having the remanants of a section
of garden syphon hose in the tank. The fibers from the
hose casing had separated from the hose and kept
clogging the tank.
Point is that more than rust can cause a clog.

Eliminate all possibilities by cutting to the chase by
doing a clean/&quot;boil&quot; of the tank, replace the fuel
lines, filters, check the pump and check/clean the
sediment bowl plus passages in the carb.

Double check to see if some DPO had installed an
additional filter  between the tank and where the fuel
line enters the engine compartment. Not a bad
suggestion on it's own merit unless you don't know of
it's existence. Inspect for the obvious and anticipate
the unexpected.
