Hi,

Everybus 2001 is coming up in just over two weeks. The event usually 
draws quite a few split screen buses. This year I wanted to do 
something to promote NEATO and boost membership. After the usual 
haphazard consideration I have decided to pitch in $5 towards the $20 
membership of the first 10 people who attend EveryBus and join NEATO 
while attending the event.

I will have membership forms available. You pay $15 and I will pay $5 
(for the first ten new members.)
