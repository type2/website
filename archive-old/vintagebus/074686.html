Subject: Re: [VB] bolt size

Thanks David, but the parts manual did not list any specifics.  It did give a
part number and a description though - 111 513 475A Screw for shock absorber
mounting, lower.....  Anyone know how long that bolt should be?  The nut is
12x1.5 so I have the diameter.


thanks,


Bart
