inchs not feet, and you should see it, the sides are pushed out over a foot
on each side, it fell right behind the pop top and pushed the roof down
almost to the Z bed pushing the sides out. I have photo's and will send to
Everett and/or Thom to post, until I get my bus pics page up. The worse part
is this was an all original, low mileage 2 owner bus, boo hoo !_!

This bus got hit by a 24 foot diameter tree!  Amazing that you even found
it!
