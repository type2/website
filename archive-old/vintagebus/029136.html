That's why the 'professionals' use the PCS Judging Guide. That removes
personalities from the equation.  (Somewhat.)  Either it's correct or it's not.

Look at: &lt;http://www.cyberkewl_dot_com/NCPCS/Documents/JudgeM.htm&gt;  Take a minute
to read the 'PCS Method' section.  One judges the car, not the owner.
