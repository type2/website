To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok time to jump in , Robert is rite i think , i use US measuring ,,the plates 
are16gaX 7/16 X 17 3/4 ,with 4mm X something thread? ,,to give a there is a 
slight raise in the plate at each hole ,i assume to give a pull down effect, 
i have made one set to finish Scotts 56, but to be honest with you i'm not 
happy with my jig ,,the raise is to domed but i'll fix that is a short ,its 
hid behind the brow outta sight for that matter, but i'm pickey,,they are 
still in development stage so if you see'em don't judge the looks yet ,,heheh 
perfection takes time. i have a process in mind that i'll try today after we 
get the Bradley's loaded up and rolling toward Fla, and let you know tonite 
,,Later
