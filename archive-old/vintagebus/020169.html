GAWD I'm pissed~!
Called the FLAPS and confirmed the needed parts,
availability and part numbers with the sales doo-rod.
Impressed the importance of getting it right as I was
going out of town at first light Saturday. 

Undetermined definition of &quot;late 67&quot; and &quot;early 67&quot;
regarding 211-405-641 options being B or D. Front
Wheel Seal, Inner Bearing. $1.17 each.
No big finances! Had the guy hold 2 of each with
ability to return wrong pair later. Just in case. No
goof-ups this time...
Sent my busy and totally understanding, OK- REALLY
busy, stressed and somewhat understanding, wife to
pick up the parts as it was impossible for me to get
to the FLAPS prior to them closing. Long week, long
day and in dire need of a long neck but still must
suck up the energy to do the repair and hit the road
at first light Saturday AM. There is always something
that prevents an early departure.
Tore down the front end to complete the simple task.
DOH! the wife dutifully asked for the right part
numbers, the FLAPS doo-rod *charged* me for the 211's
of either option but *physically* handed over 111's of
the B option that I needed. DAMN! Not EVEN close...
I will be at BAP at first light &lt;of 9AM&gt; with the
seals and plenty of grease on my hands to ease the
insertion of the 111's into the doo-rods third
input...
GRRRRRR! 
See you all in Prescott by mid day- early afternoon.
Make sure that I camp RIGHT next to Rubber Johnny and
the Diggery-doo/bongo ridalin deserving meth twins.
