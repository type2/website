&gt; I have a bus with no title or registration.
&gt; How can I get it titled?
&gt; I live in Wa. state and the bus has Ca. plates.
&gt; It's been sitting for 15 years and nobody know who owned it last.
&gt; Can I take the title and ID plates from a junk bus or will I go to Jail?

Here in NH, any motor vehicle over 10 years old will not be issued a
title...  I recently sold a vehicle to a fella down in MA (requires title on
ALL vehicles regardless of year), All he needed was a letter from NH state
DMV stating title policy and a bill of sale...

Take care
