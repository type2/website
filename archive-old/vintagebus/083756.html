Subject: Followup: Starter bushing fits loosely--a problem?

Good evening!

Well, I couldn't wait for another bushing from a different vendor. I've
been waiting long enough already to get the engine Ronnie built for me
installed. So here's what I did: I used a tapered socket on an
extension  to protect my fingers, inserted it into one end of the
bushing and tapped increasingly hard with a 3 lb hammer until the
bushing was belled enough that it no longer would push in by hand. I
tapped the bushing into place from the starter side so that the
rearward movement of the starter gear would further push the bushing
into place if it happened to touch it. I tested the starter a few times
and checked the position of the bushing and noticed no movement. So I
installed the engine, connected the wiring and other stuff and fired it
up. It turned over just fine and it runs swell!!!

So far so good. Only many many starts will show if this was a wise
work-around or if I should have waited for the correct bushing to
arrive. Wish me luck--I may need it. Perhaps I should order a bushing
or two just in case... The sad thing was that I added a special note to
the order department at WW to make sure that the bushing was for a 6V
trans to a 12V starter conversion! Better make that three or four
bushings, each from a separate vendor!

&gt; Good morning!
&gt;
&gt; I am converting my '64 Std to 12V and drove the original bushing out
&gt; with a 9mm socket on an extension. It seemed to be in tightly.
&gt; However
&gt; the new &quot;6V-to-12V&quot; bushing I got from WW just slides right in. And
&gt; out. When the engine is installed it appears that the range the
&gt; bushing
&gt; can move will be limited by the case and the gear on the starter, but
&gt; I
&gt; wonder if this is going to cause problems. Has anyone encountered
&gt; this
&gt; before? If it will be a problem if left like this, has anyone got a
&gt; workaround or should I try another bushing from another source?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help in this.
