Subject: Re: Flip seat Westy/ M code help

My '59 SO-23 has the SK indentifier on the M-code, SK 693.  The research I did at the time led me to believe that SK did in fact stand for Sikkens paint.  I originally thought that it meant special color, but read something somewhere that changed my opinion.  My '59 is Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey, and there doesn't seem to be anything *special* about the colors, or the way in which it was painted.  Except if you look at it in this June's issue of Hot VWs.  The color is VERY special, it's faded out, washed out tan!!!
