No, its a matter of their Webhost (burlee_dot_com)  being too lame.
Arizonabusclub is hosted on a webhost not a ISP. Mine works fine both ways
http://dropgates_dot_com but the name is hosted on a domain host which is
entirely seperate of my ISP webhost. I thought you were a internet guru and
knew all this stuff??...
I shopped around to different Domain hosts to make sure I got one that could
do non www.  Lots of em cant do it or charge extra for it. Same goes for
webhosts. If you think its lame, talk to everett, he set that site up.

&gt;That's a simple matter of your ISP being too lame to create
&gt;the appropriate DNS aliases...
