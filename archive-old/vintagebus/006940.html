There are 3 repop emblems out there that I know of;


1.  Round tool box companies,  fair at best, wrong curve, extremely thin
metal, very easy to tell from an original,  points inside are way off

2. I S P West also sells a repo, always on E-Bay usually go for around 15
dollars, these seem to be a little better then Round tool box companies, the
points inside are a little crisper, but again thin metal and the curve shape
is off

3.  WCM, I thought they were getting these from I S P West, but from what
I've had (none recently) and seen the gauge of the metal was the closet and
the stampings right on, I used to display one of theirs next to an original
at the swaps and most people would pick the repop over the original as the
real thing. Was just something I'd do to show the quality of their repop.
The way to tell WCM from the original is WCM has wing nut fasteners.

4. Round tool box also is the only companies I know of that does a Barn door
emblem repop.

I've never seen a # on on.

Look at the quality of the stamping.  The repros are very thin, and the
lines are 
not as &quot;crisp&quot;  The inside corners of the stamping will generally have
imperfections
because the stamping dies used to make the repros are not as good as the
originals, and
they're not stamped with the same amount of force.  Roundboxtools
commissioned 
some repros that were pretty good, but not *perfect*.  I saw one that was
sold by one
of the mail-order shops, blisted-packaged on carboard, that was just
hideous.  The
chrome on the repros suck as well.

It's best if you have a known original emblem on hand to compare against.
