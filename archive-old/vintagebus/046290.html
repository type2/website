&lt;&lt; where is the best place to support the bus when you cant support it by the 
beam?  I was figuring the frame crossmeber behind the beam, maybe using a 4x4 
between 2 jackstands? pad the jackstands??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Best way to hold up a bus while either the complete front or rear is out is 
to assemble a pile of 4x4s under the center of the bus.  This makes it very 
stable while you remove, and later manhandle in the heavy front beam or 
tranny back in place.     Eric&amp;Barb
