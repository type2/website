  Hello again from Quaker ridge fellow volks folks! I picked up two
strange busses today had to take them both for one price. One is a 64
with a hacked up home camper instillation, hacked bulkhead, and  missing
the rear wheel-wells. I have to say the bass-boat seats are a nice
addition(lol) Over all the bus is in nice shape body wise with rust in
the normal spots. it was sold as a package  with the good bus!! The good
bus is a 1966 standard micro bus with a sliding door. Looks like
original paint with surface rust very solid underside. Missing rear
seats however the panels are still intact. It is a non walkthrough and
it has three windows on each side (behind the doors). It has three
pop-outs on the driver side and one on the sliding door the other window
on the sliding door is solid. I guess what I wanted to ask is how rare
was the sliding door, and has anyone ever seen a slider with windows
before. I have only seen pics. of cargo busses with sliders. the windows
are without doubt factory installed in the door and look the same as any
other splitty windows. 
    Here is the m-code info if anyone cares to decode it for me.
