Subject: Why do I have no spark?

Hi list. I was working on the bus engine today and I can't seem to get it to fire. It has an Ignitor on it (and I can't remember where the 2 wires came from off the coil when I took them off), it also has a altenator. Other than that it's an average everday ignition system. we've tried everything: changed 2 coils, tried a different dist (with the points and condensor) even though it was an old 40 horse big body style, tried taking a plug out and grounding it, and changing the wires aound on the coil to every configuration we could think of, and it still has no spark. we also tried taking the main wire to the dist off and grounding it to see if the coil was even sparking and if wasn't. what could I possibly be missing? I know I have a good 12v going to the coil when the ignition switch is on, and it still doesn't work. Does anybody have any ideas? I know we're missing something simple, but I been out there so long I'm fed up. I really need help!! Any ideas out there? which posts on the coil do the 2 from the dist go with the electronic ignition? anything else we could have missed? Thanks for any help You guys (and gals) can give me. I really need this engine to run sometime this century.
