Well.....thanks to those who supplied the info for the above part!!!
I can't believe that I have spent so much time trying to find some
originals and instead could have been enjoying the rack with aftermarket
clamps from these guys.
I haven't seen them, but have been assured that they will work.
So, to Eric of Eric and Barb fame....I will get your original clamp back
to you very soon now!  I won't need to bother having tooling built up so
that we can make our own.  I like that.
Parts is Parts by the way was the correct answer!
later
