Subject: Re: [VB] re: dynamat &amp; insulating between the floor and belly
  pans

paint it with roofing tar.   protects against rust too.   not good for where 
welding gets done, though.

The List
I have a question regarding this topic as well  I  would like to use
some type of sound proofing  in between the floor and the belly pans on
the inside of the belly pans of my deluxe. I was thinking of using
roofing torch down material (used on flat roofed buildings). I figure I
would literly torch it down the same way before installing the new
floors.

BTW I have my flooring currently removed and the belly pans under them
are perfectly solid.

Eric,  I would be interested in knowing the product that you used from
home dept as well.
