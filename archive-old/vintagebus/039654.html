Ive never owned a bus done in shag, although 1 67 I had should have had it 
cause the bucket front seat replacement was begging for it.

Anyway its friday so:
At a junkyard a couple of months ago I saw one of the biggest cars I have 
seen in along time. Big US 1970 something car with a reworked back end to 
hold rear facing seats where the trunk would have been. Done fairly well. 
That part anyways.
They cut the roof off so it was a big open topped car.
What about shag carpeting you ask. Oh it had it! All over the sides, the 
hood, everywhere. This car was loaded with shag! Every square inch of this 
car had carpet. I saw it on a rainy day and that thing must have weighed an 
extra ton. Funny thing was I could lift the carpet from the adhiesive and 
even where there had been bare metal from cutting, it wasnt rusting. The 
rubber backing was protecting this car!

And it had all the maintence and warrentee stuff in the glove box.

Those meddeling kids........
