This is Ken's wife, Erin, aka the cruise director. Steve Dolan just called
and said he's in Clines Corner, New Mexico headed very slowly toward
Albuquerque. He seems to be having a lot of trouble overheating and would
like to know if there is anyone in the area he could stay with tonight. He
will call back here for any responses at 11:30 cst when Ken is due home.
Please e-mail Ken asap so we can let him know something then.

Thanks,
Erin
