hey all.  While searching for truck bumper info I came across a tidbit less
than clearly worded implying that when the full width front  bench seat buses
switched (oct 60 VIN 673 946) from having one place to hook the seat into to 3
choices, that they also got the humped back of the front seat.    Any
feedback?

PS my 59  truck has the humpback, but I do not considered pretty much anything
not welded in place to be original on that old b%stard 

Clara

PPS the discrepancy in switch to sturdy bumper I mnetion before was because
the later number was for the bumper with overriders.  Whethr that was because
it was the first N Am spec bus made after the first number, or whether there
are a few N Am spec buses with stamped bumpers made after the Euro spec ones
have sturdy ones, I do not know.
