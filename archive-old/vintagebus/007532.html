Not really; sounds just like me a couple of days ago. After a good day,
great day when I worked on my bus I sat in it and day dreamed about driving
my bus. It's not that distant at all. Someone, here Karl told me to look at
the Zits cartoon in Sunday's paper. So I went out and got it and I looked. I
think everyone here should take a look at it too since I'm pretty sure
everyone did the same in their bus at one point or another.

Later,

&gt; &gt;everything worked perfectly (I did not try the starter)  I was beaming
&gt; &gt; from ear to ear!  I hopped in the driver's seat and turned the original
&gt; &gt; Sapphire AM radio on.  I jammed to some country tunes and day dreamed
&gt; &gt; about the day I will be driving the bus.  What a motivating experience!
