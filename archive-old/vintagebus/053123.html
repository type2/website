Hi everyone! I've come to the point that I've got to sell my 62 Bus, It's a 
red kombi with white bumpers , primered cargo section and so on, all stock 
looking. I drove it daily until winter set in then took it off the road to 
drive my old Jetta (heat).  I've done alot of bodywork on it, which were cab 
floors, rockers, left dog leg, new window gaskets. It still needs some work 
underneath, but structurally the bus is fine. It's very presentable! It runs 
well and has new brakes all around including hoses and lines. I'm asking 1800 
for it, more than what I've got into it. But I've got another car on the way 
and cant have everything, so this one has to go. I'm located in western MA, 
incidently. Thanks!
