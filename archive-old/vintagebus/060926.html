Subject: Help with (tranny?) noise

So I've been getting a knocking/rattling sound when
 I disengage the
 clutch under a load (i.e. when starting up a hill).
 After consulting
 with Muir and FLAPS, I decided it must be a busted
 front tranny
 mount. It looked OK from under the bus (a 64
 deluxe), but I figured
 they knew more than I did. Anyways, I just spent the
 last 2 days
 pulling the engine and tranny, putting in the new
 mount and putting
 everything back together again. Just gave it the
 first test drive
 and it sounds pretty much exactly how it did before
 I started.

 Any ideas?

 Frustrated,

 --Jonny
