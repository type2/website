I'm replacing the throw out on my van, and it just doesn't look right after 
I install it.  The spindle coming out of the transmission does not pass 
directly through the center of the bearing.  It passes about a half inch 
above the center of the ring...is this normal?  The number on the throwout 
is EM 3159 140 037 from Sachs, and I'm installing it into a '70 Beetle 
transmission number 113 301 183F.
Thanks in advance,
