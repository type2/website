&lt;&lt; Not that it matters much....
 
 But this bus was recently purchased by the seller for just over $4,000 US
 
 Im sure he could have put $5,000 into it in the past 3 weeks, but I kinda
 doubt it.  If you want to buy it maybe that will give you some room for
 negotiation.
 
 anyway, that is all...

I was interested in the bus, and I know the previous owner, I questioned the 
&quot;new&quot; owner about what he had done to it for that much of a price inflation 
and he was honest and told me he detailed and cleaned it up real good, but he 
feels that is the correct market price.
