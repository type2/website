&lt;&lt; never realized how much area there is on a bus.  I have seen it said in 
many 
 FS ads &quot;When I was doing the resto, I decided not to get the drivers side 
 long panel flat and perfect because I wanted to keep it looking vintage.&quot;  
 Truth be known, they said that because getting that panel to come out just 
 right is tedious work.  Not difficult, just requires large amounts of time 
 and patience. &gt;&gt;

no, actually there is a factory wave in the long side of the bus.  you can 
work and take it out to make the bus flat, but then vintage freaks will point 
and laugh.    Really.  I've seen they do it.

I agree there is loads of bodywork.  when I was doing prep on my westy, it 
took longer than I expected.   (though I didn't get the whole bus 
sandblasted.)   At one point I stopped, and said 'it's fine, let's throw th 
paint on before I go batshit.&quot;   There are plenty of spots that could have 
been finished more, but nothing too blatant.  I was aiming for the decent 
looking driver rather than a show bus anyway.   there was a learning curve 
too, as I had never done paint prep before.  Anyway, it looks tons better 
than pre paint, better than I expected, and years later I still get 
compliments.   hmm. I think it was 4 or 5 years now.  I posted to the list 
while doing it so you can read about it in the archives.  
So it'll all be over soon, and you can adore the fruit of your labour for 
years after.
