Hey guys, in addition to the hatch incompatability that Neil mentioned, i beleive
the pre-64 roof sections have a totally different curve to the rear corners.
 if memory serves, it is a much 'sharper' of a corner on the earlier busses.


I agree with Neil though, just find yourself a nice 64-67 roof and use it. 
or just tel your friend to go buy a deluxe and not be a poser  ;-)

&gt; deluxe sunroof clip fit a 66?   Roofs same or different? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Pete,
&gt;If you mean the non-barndoor 1955 then yes it is the same roof up to AUG1967.

&gt; Of course the 1966 will have to have the subfloor pans added to stiffen the

&gt;frame and prevent warping/bending of the bus body/frame.  Eric&amp;Barb

&gt;Hey,  just a thought, but should'nt you guys be concerned with the big hatch

&gt;/ little hatch difference?  Don't the big hatch buses have spring loaded 
&gt;things welded onto the roof corners to support the hatch?   If so,  you are

&gt;going to have to try to put those into an early roof clip and get them square

&gt;so the hatch closes properly and keeps rain out too.  I think it might be 

&gt;easier to try to find a 64-67 style roof clip for the swap.
