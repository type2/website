Subject: Re: [VB] Help: excessively high oil pressure

In a message dated 3/9/2005 5:11:26 A.M. Pacific Standard Time,  
fig_at_zebrasafari.co.za writes:     &gt;&gt; I think  there are three possibilities:
a) oil pressure relief valve spring too  strong;
b) the &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump fitted by the engine builder is too  beefy for
the job; or
c) there is a blocked oilway or incorrectly fitted  bearing that is blocking
oil flow and causing back pressure into the  cooler.  &lt;&lt;




Hi Fig,
We have had &quot;A&quot; happen to us, and know &quot;B&quot; can happen, but doubt &quot;C&quot; could  
happen just by one bearing being blocked.
  Also could be due to, or at least partly due to:
D.  Using too thick of oil for the outside temp.
E.  Using the grooved oil pressure relief valve in outside temps  below 70 F.
