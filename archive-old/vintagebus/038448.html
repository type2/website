Everything I have ready says otherwise... the larger fan is critical to flow
into the doghouse and you actually end up with WORSE than non-doghouse if
you use the small fan.

My local VW FLAPS had a new fan for under $25...

The fan that goes with the doghouse cooler is wider; you can probably
use the small fan in the big housing, but it's probably sub-optimal.
