&gt; you have exhaust gases going through a heavy metal finned tube. I think this 
&gt; is aluminum.

Hi Kevin,
Close!  It is a steel J-bent shaped pipe with a cast on aluminum sleeve and 
exterior fins.  For most of the first year and half since the introduction of 
fresh air in the type 1s &amp; 2s in DEC62 this steel tube was a round cross 
section.  Just before the introduction of the 1964 model year change with 
larger HE outlets this steel tube got an increase of interior surface area 
which increased heat exchanging and even more important less back pressure 
and less over heating problems during hot weather.
  Check section M-1 page 3, this page in our original 1963-67 Workshop Manual 
VW Transporter was printed 12 of 62 the rear view of the engine with cut away 
views shows a round cross section with exterior fins of the HE tubes.
  Then check a later VW Official Service Manual like our 1970-79 type 1 
printed by Bentley.  In section 1, page 4 the same rear view drawing of the 
engine shows interior finned tubes with exterior cast fins.
