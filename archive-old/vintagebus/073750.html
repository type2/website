&gt; I have and oil filter pump on my 65 westy, and it runs cool.  It has a header
&gt; (I know, I know) but the thing is the 6V small gen pulley.   But its runs too
&gt; cool in the winter.
&gt; 
&gt;  So what I am saying is, is there another cause of heating you could find?
&gt; Did you always have this filter pump on this motor, or did it start running
&gt; hotter after you put on the filter pump
&gt; 
&gt; enquiring minds want to know

Well, just for those inquiring minds.  The motor is one I built (1600
30/31 running 117 main 65 idles ,CW crank,6.9CR,stock air cleaner,
doghouse fan(wide)/shroud/cooler, flaps,stock geared '67 tranny, 15&quot;
205/70/15's) and has always had the filter pump on it.  It really only
runs hot if I do 65+ and the ambient is over 90.

I've checked the exhaust with an external thermocouple and my multi
meter and near the oil filter 1/4 inch away it is 300+ degrees after a
long run.  

I've been meaning to change over to the tight finned T3 cooler ala
Ronnie, but have not had a chance.

Fantastically smooth and reliable motor so far (7000+ miles), but I'd
like it to be a bit more consistent.  The Berg stick could be off or so
could the VDO.  One of them is off I know, because at times the VDO
reads almost 210 and the stick is going off, while at other times, the
VDO reads 210+ and the Berg gauge does not even light up.  I need to
independently test each.   How do you do that????  By the way when is
the Berg temp-a-stick calibrated to light up?
