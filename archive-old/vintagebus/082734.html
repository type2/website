&gt;&gt;  How long does it take someone to swap out their tranny for  one of 
these assuming they would keep their reduction boxes?  &lt;&lt;

 
Hi iamdonquixote,
We have done the rebuilding of the RGBs, installing them on the  tranny, and 
installing the tranny and engine, while taking our time in a  weekend.  
Probably could do it in four hours if the tranny was  finished RGB to RGB.
  Good idea while the engine and tranny is out to remove the shift  linkages 
to replace, the front/rear shift tube seals and the front/rear bushings  with 
lots of grease.  We did this and resulted in MUCH nicer tighter  shifting.

&gt;&gt;   Also, can you get trannys that are complete  from redux box -&gt; 
redux box.    One more, is there  anyplace that you can send your reduxtion 
boxes 
to where they can be  rebuilt? &lt;&lt;
 
We do not know of anywhere that will do that, and even if we did we  would 
not do that.  Plus it just adds to the man hours you have to pay  for and 
possible shipping weight.  Rebuilding RGBs is very easy, if you  take your time, and 
you can do a much better job than most shops.   Additionally if you are going 
to drive your bus you need to know how to rebuild  a RGBs.  We have twice 
done 1955-63 small nut RGBs on the road and the  last time we did the job in two 
hours, by having the knowledge, tools,  gear oil, and the bearings on hand.
