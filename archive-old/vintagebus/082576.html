Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

mmmm - agree about not needing heavy duty support
but I was thinking more about 'end droop' on the batten
if it wasn't rigid and there was nothing to screw the end
into underneath...

(Hang on!  I've been getting bombarded with emails about end
droop - I'll go and actually read one to see if there's anything
there that will help!....)

&lt;&lt; hmmm - well functionally the front most 'join' probably needs something 
more
 rigid than a press board strip because the underlying batten that it joins
 across
 doesn't extend across the full width of the space beside the heater vent...
......
well, that's what they used on at least some of them... it just covers the 
gap really, not exactly heavy duty support needed
