Subject: [T3] our wrecked 71 squareback in miami

I need to start thinking about getting it out of the driveway.

It got hit in the drivers side pretty bad.
Ill post pictures up if anyone cares to see.

Im open to selling parts off of it.
It can be had for free if you pick it up but without the engine and FI
system and components.
400.00 I think with the engine and FI because they are worth at least that
much to me.

Its a green 71 square with original FI intact, everything worked before it
got hit. has a custom interior green/brown vinyl which is pretty nice.

oh I have a pair of those fiberglass speaker panels in there.
If its free Ill probably pull the speakers out.

I think thats about it.

cheers
andy
