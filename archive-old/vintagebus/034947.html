To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey all,

still buying parts for the 1776 and wanted to know who has the best price for 
90.5 mm pistons and jugs and also some scat lifters?  local shops here in 
ohio are charging 205.99 for mahle 90.5 pistons it is unbelievable. I need a 
much better deal than that ? whos got the goods for good price ?
