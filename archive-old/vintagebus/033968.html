&lt;&lt; I had a little trouble with second gear. Tranny grinds going into it.  If 
I'm REAL carefull and baby it into 2nd with low RPM's and slow smooth

Hi Rex,
Make sure to first check your clutch pedal play and tranny oil level.  If 
these are at proper levels then your second gear syncro might be worn out or 
messed up a bit.  If it is the syncro then baby it and learn how to double 
clutch especially when down shifting.  We have often seen syncros polish 
themselfs up when carefully shifted.  

&lt;&lt; Or do I need to start saving for a tranny while this one is wearing out?&gt;&gt;
Anyone who drives a bus as a daily driver should have $ in the bank or be 
saving up for the time they will need an engine or tranny on short notice!  
Even just putting away $20.00 a month away for emergancy repairs adds up 
quickly to an amount that will help at least take out the monetary sting of 
the moment.    Eric&amp;Barb
