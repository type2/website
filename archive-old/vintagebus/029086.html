Subject: Interior followup Q's

 Thanks to all who replied to my interior Q's.  Here are a few more.

My bus is a 65 Samba w/ gray S&amp;P interior

Did the rear corner panels (The one that curves around the corner) have
headliner material on it?  If not, what was the color and texture.

What was the color and texture on the corner panel below the windows but
above the engine tray?

Did the rubber headliner tuck strip start and stop in different places
over the years?

Thanks again
Matthew
