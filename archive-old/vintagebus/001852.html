Hey Volks

A while back it was mentioned that the headlights from a range of
Mercedes-Benz trucks are the same as those fitted to splitties, and these
are still availably new from Mercedes truck dealers.

Below is a picture of two of these trucks with the same headlights as our
buses. And this pic is a taste of African public transport for all you First
Worlders ;-). The pic was taken somewhere in the Sahara, probably on the
migration route from Niger to Libya.
