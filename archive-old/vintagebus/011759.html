Les,

&gt;&gt;The County has finally come down on me: they want my bus repaired or 
&gt;&gt;moved. And, I am still unable to get it running. This week, I replaced 

Where do you live?  I had a similar problem vs. the City of Houston
regarding one of my old busses.  The law here says that you can't keep
junk cars, and a junk car is one that either 1) doesn't have current
plates &amp; safety sticker, or 2) can't start and move at least 10 feet
under its own power.  But, &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;antique&quot; cars are exempt.

Texas defines historic vehicles to be those 35 years or older.  When
I lived in Michigan, it was 25 years or older.  Maybe you can get an
exemption for your '65 under a clause like that.

Bill
