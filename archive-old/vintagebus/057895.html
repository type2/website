Subject: Re: [VB] New Member/Radio?

There are plenty of original used Sapphire and Blaupunkt bus radios for
sale on the Internet at places such as eB*y, perhaps VW Planet as well. 
If you find a good one but it doesn't work, there is at least one fellow
in Penna. who specializes in fixing old European auto radios.

If you need a modern radio there was a thread a while back about a Radio
Shack model that would fit in a stock hole in a bus dashboard (check the
archives) - downside was that Radio Shack was closing out it's auto
radio products and you had to grab one while still in stock.  Don't know
if it had that 'retro' look, though.

&gt; I am a newbie. Cut my teeth on a 71 bus and six months ago realized a
&gt; dream and bought a 67 deluxe. I'm learning a lot - plan to bring my
&gt; lowered bus back to stock - install a ball joint front end and trade
&gt; my swing axle kit for stock tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway - my question is simple - can someone recommend a source for a
&gt; retro looking AM-FM radio that will fit stock in my 67 dash?
