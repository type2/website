Hi George. I respect your point of view and enjoy your posts, but I disagree 
with you (I think we disagree but we probably have common ground).

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The attached Letter to the Editor was published in my local paper this
&gt; &gt; &gt;morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to write back. I can think 
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt;dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I would share his 
&gt;letter
&gt; &gt; &gt;with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to destroy this guy's
&gt; &gt; &gt;nonsense.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He should read the article in Discover about suvs. They kill people. 
&gt;Mostly
&gt; &gt; others, but the also tip over. Buses keep most of thier weight neer the
&gt; &gt; ground and dont ride up on other cars when they hit them.
&gt;
&gt;I think that you should take another look at the physics here.  Buses do
&gt;tend to be pretty tippy, probably moreso than most modern SUVs.

Are they? Remember the bus is high but the weight is centered down low. How 
many bus rollovers have you seen? Sure driven around corners, we all know 
that the early busses hit a limit and then roll, but how many actually do? 
Doesnt this have a lot to do with the fact that busses really arent very 
fast?

The auto
&gt;manufacturers don't want to get savaged by Consumer Reports as Suzuki was,
&gt;so they have made their SUVs wider and lower than the older &quot;serious&quot; off
&gt;roaders.  Buses are very narrow with respect to their height and the
&gt;wonderful ground clearance of a bus does little to lower the CG.  If
&gt;Consumer Reports had tested the VW bus then Suzuki would have been off the
&gt;hook.
OK. they may tip over, it happens. In my experience and with others, the 
wheels tend to slip and the bus will slide before rollover.


&gt;I think that the reason that a lot of folk have gone to SUVs is identical
&gt;to the reason that many of us love our buses.  They wanted a car that
&gt;would carry a lot of stuff and that wasn't bothered by the occasional
&gt;rough road.  Of course, people get carried away with everything, so some
&gt;SUVs are becoming pleasure barges rather than utility vehicles.  I've seen
&gt;quite a few buses that fall into that catagory as well.
&gt;
&gt;All vehicles are quite safe if driven within their limits.  Don't mistake
&gt;lack of education on the part of the drivers for a defect in the vehicles.
&gt;The safest vehicle can be dangerous if driven by an idiot!
&gt;

And if that idiot is sitting in the position of getting really f-d up if he 
(or she) where to crash, like in the front of a bus, they might not be so 
stupid?

&gt; &gt; Its also interesting to note that an suv wastes time. See article to 
&gt;find
&gt; &gt; out why.
&gt;
&gt;I did.  Imagine if they had taken data for buses! :)
&gt;

Yea take the data on my bus( or was my bus) VW put gears into their cars to 
have them pull out and go. The fastest car off the line for years was the 
1967 Bug. My bus inst far behind. With reduction boxes and a stock motor I 
would wager that I wouldnt have any problem getting going.

&gt;I find it rather humorous that the basic thrust of their article was that
&gt;SUVs are driven too fast, then they turn around and say that they impede
&gt;traffic because they don't accelerate from lights as quickly as other
&gt;cars.
&gt;
&gt;I guess that we should all be driving Ferraris that are governed to a
&gt;maximum speed of 50 MPH. :)

No. The thrust of the article was that these are very heavy large vehicles 
that are driven as if they are invincible, and can ride up and kill 
passengers in other cars.
