&lt;&lt; Did you rebuild the engine?  Did someone else?  Did they, perchance, put 
the
 cylinder air deflectors on the top??? (Yes, they do that... I've seen it!) 
 How about the thermostat?  Flap position?  Are they open? Opening? Not 
there? 
 (And you DID take the rag out of the fan, didn't you?) ;o) &gt;&gt;

haha!!!  I rebuilt the engine myself and no I did NOT put the deflectors on 
the top.  Everything else if fine.  The air is blowing where it should be but 
the engine itself is heating that air so all the air is just hot.  

Looks like I need to check the compression.  Anyone is phoenix have a 
compression gauge they would like to let me borrow?  Kinda stranded at home 
with no money.
