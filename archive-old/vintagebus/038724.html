Which shop is that?  I don't know of any good ACVW shops in michigan!  Most
shops in Michigan that want to work on ACVW want to turn it into a dune
buggy for Silver Lake Sand Dunes.

Usually because there is nothing left of the car to turn it into anything
else. Michigan is a tough place to live for an aircooled enthusiast, unless
you only drive it for the two months out of the year when the weather is
nice or you like watching your car vanish before your eyes. Been there, done
that, moved away. JMHO :)
