Subject: RE: engine ID &amp; air cleaner on a 1961

I have several questions! My 1961 double cab has a later model engine but I
can't quite figure out what it has; there are no numbers on the case. I know
it is a single port, most likely a 1500 or 1600. The distributor is an 035
vacuum advance. The carb is a 30 PICT.

Any thoughts on exactly what I have in there?

What I am really trying to do is get the air cleaner connections back to a
&quot;correct&quot; configuration. My air cleaner is on the left side, but the opening
in the sheet metal (breast plate) for the hose that comes down from the air
intake port, is on the right side of the engine. I don't think there would
be a problem running an air hose in front of the crank pulley to bring that
hose through the sheet metal because apparently on type 2's with a gas
heater the aircleaner was on the right and this hose had to run, right to
left, in front of the crank pulley.  This sounds a little confusing but I am
sure it make sense to someone out there. I have looked at all the pictures
in my 1963-67 Type 2 Bentley and can't find an engine that looks exactly
like mine.

What kind of hose should this be, paper or cloth bound rubber? What size is
it?

What is this hose actually for and what does it connect to after passing
below the sheet metal?

Also the weighted flap valve on my air cleaner is broken off. Are there any
major problems that could occur becasue this valve is missing?

Did the 1961 come with a 1200 or 1300?

Thanks,
