Subject: TIME TO BEG FOR A BOLT !!

TIME TO BEG FOR A BOLT [RGBox bolt] one of the four.  AND/OR TIME TO LEARN TO
WORK ON MY BUS.

Took the bus to the good mechanic today.  He had the bolt and I arranged to
bring it in today.  It is way far from my house, and my job but all around the
shop are fast food places .. StarBucks etc .. So I brought a book, my iPod and
so on .. Drove up and told him that I would hang around [no matter how long it
took] until it was done.  Told him I will shop some, go to Starbucks and read
until they ask me to leave.  Go to McDonalds for lunch etc .. but he just kept
saying &quot;bring it back when you can leave it for the day.&quot;  I said that was
what I was planning on, I would just be close by .. He said &quot;no, bring it when
you can leave it.&quot;  What's up with that?  Besides, I want to see the work that
is being done on my bus from now on.  I don't mean sit on his lap or anything
.. but I don't want to just leave it and go.

Am I wrong ?? Am I being unreasonable ??

If not .. will someone please send me a bolt??
