I don't really mind not

The engine lid and the rubber seals that it closes onto are essential to the
cooling of that new motor of yours. Without a properly sealed engine hatch
your motor will run HOT. I don't know this for sure but I think that the
engine lid from any bay window bus will fit your bus.
