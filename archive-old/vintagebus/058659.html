Subject: Re: [VB] DC rear seats

&gt;My 60 DC had a different rear base then the ones found
&gt;on the 61-65.  I belive that there are 4.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Binz
&gt;2.  59-60
&gt;3.  61-65
&gt;4.  66-67
&gt;
&gt;The difference on my DC was the orientation of the two
&gt;upper rear mounts.  I do not remember which way they
&gt;were, but the were opposite to the 61-65 bases.

Yes, I believe you are correct.  If you may remember my search for a correct 
seat stand for my '62 I finally found one which dipped in the middle, but 
the upper mounting tabs point inwards on the one I settled for.  It must be 
the '59-'60 seat base that I have, as the DC body mounting areas want the 
tabs to be pointing outwards.

Willing to trade anyone for a '61-'65 base if the need the earlier one.

Alex
