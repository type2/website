    A while back, No Quarter made a post about the Snap-On tool guy he
knows and how he almost got a good deal on a *heated* parts washer... I
think that one was water-based too IIRC.
    One might find out if someone else besides Snap-On makes it ( a
common practice... Sioux makes their valve seat surfacing kit and valve
grinders, etc...) and how the water is heated... might get a complete
heating setup for cheap. .._dot_cause the $nap-On $tuff is dear...
    Incidentally, if you'll look in the Snap-On Tools catalog, in the
parts-washers section, you'll see a DP cylinder head sitting in one of
the washers ;)
    I like the idea of a heating element from a water heater best
though... I went down to the local dump to recycle a few gallons of oil
yesterday, and noticed that there were 2 or 3 used water heaters in the
scrap metal pile (and most of the time they are thrown away if only
*one* of the elements is bad... shame).
    It also doesn't take hardly any time to check the elements for
continuity... find a decent-looking water heater with one good element,
and you could get it for free, practically... if the dump supervisor is
giving you the hairy eyeball, well then a 5 or 10 may bend the &quot;no
scavenging&quot; rules... you, uh, forgot that you brought the good water
heater to the dump and left the bad one back at the house or something
like that, yeah...
