Subject: Re: Type IV into a vintage bus?

&gt;With all the talk of engine decisions, what would stop someone from
putting
&gt;a great type IV engine/tranmsission into an early bus?  Too much engine
bay
&gt;surgery? simply fit?

Rich,

I'm in the process of doing that very thing to my '60 crewcab.  There
are a number of people on this list who have also done the same.  I just
ordered my cooling shroud from Oregon Performance Products last week and
this will allow me to convert the engine from a pancake to an upright
and install it without cutting the bus.  I have seen the pancakes
dropped in but the rear end of the bus was cut off.

Joe Cali has a book that explains step by step the process required to
create your own cooling tin from cast off type I and IV tin.

I have a link to his site and other conversion sites/mfgrs at
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/typeIV.html

Its been a few months since I've updated that page, but progress has
been slow since I've been trying to keep up with all the work that's
come in here.

Scott Fraser
