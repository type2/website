Hey all,
 
    I'm having a little trouble I need some help with......My engine has
really not wanted to hold its idle. I changed the fuel filter, adjusted
the valves, changed the points, cleaned the carb and it still hasn't
changed... I replaced my cap and rotor a few months ago and they look
fine. The motor will start fine but as far as the idle goes it seems to
want to die out. I adjusted the idle screw on the carb and that didn't
really do much....This just started doing this and I'm not sure what to
do next... Any suggestions would be great.

Thanks, Shawn
