Just my $.02:

Vintage, as far as I understand, refers to Type 2's built before the 1968 
model year.  So, a bus with a 427 side oiler with Cobra valve covers, lake 
pipes, and Cragar rims would still be &quot;vintage&quot; but not &quot;stock.&quot;
In other words this list applies to busses built before 1968, no matter what 
personal taste, motivation, or appearance.  It does not cater specifically to 
stock, original condition type 2's.

Years ago I was complaining about the heater efficiency in my 1967 west.  My 
Dad asked me if I had the belly pan on.  I didn't.  Put it on, he said, it 
will make a difference.  Well, I did, and the bus was 500% warmer.
