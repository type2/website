&lt;&lt; Why wouldn't you use it just like motorcyclists use theirs?  Run until 
sputter, switch to reserve, refuel at next opportunity.  That's why there's 
no need for a gauge - you have an impossible-to-ignore indication of when 
you're low on fuel. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
Years ago we drove up Chinook pass in the Cascade mountains in our 63 K.Ghia 
to do Thanksgiving dinner at a relatives vaction cabin in the foothills.  
Lots of snow on the ground and more falling every minute.  Passed plenty of 
old accident sites of cars in ditches.  Just a mile or two before arriving at 
our destination we came across a stranded vanagon with a nice couple with 
thier two kids and one infant and the wife's parents visiting from sunny S. 
Cal..  Could not fix thier vanagon due to what turned out later to be due to 
an electrical fuel pump stuck with grit in it.  None of them had heavy coats 
and no blankets on board, in other words the average Americans with no 
forethought.  Drove the husband 30 miles downhill to his home so he could 
borrow his nieghbor's van to rescue his family when it turned out all the 
local tow trucks were back ordered with jobs, and we ended up getting back to 
the dinner after all of it had been consumed!  
  Because we did this good deed these nice folk asked us several times out 
and we accepted.  Each time we went over to thier place and they took us out 
in thier vanagon.  Each and every time this happened they would stop and put 
only a dollar or two of fuel in the tank to keep it from running completely 
dry!  The third or so time this happen we asked them if they always keep 
there cars so low on gas?  &quot;Yes!&quot; they said and we asked them &quot;What would 
they do if one of thier family had to get to the hospital quickly?&quot;, tell 
them &quot;Just a minute honey while we get some gas!&quot;, when minutes matter?  We 
informed them we filled ours when hitting about half a tank just in case for 
emergency and only going below this on long milage trips when we would plan 
our fuel ups carefully.
  Two weeks later the fellow of this family was taking a day off from his 
high paying computer programming job that kept him busy 6 days a week 12 to 
16 hours a day.  He and a friend were doing some wood working.  He turned to 
his friend and told him that he was going to do something with the router 
that was not safe, but this would save some time.  A few minutes later one of 
his little fingers was loose on the floor!  
  We got a call from them a week after this happened and they thanked us 
profusely for our suggestion to keep at least a half tank in the vanagon, it 
had come in handy!  The little finger had been successfully reattached though 
was missing alot of feeling.  Interestingly the same day this fellow cut his 
finger off a close friend of our's cut off half his thumb and had to wait 1/2 
hour for the very same surgeon to operate on him!  Yes we figured out the 
timeline and the little finger was worked on just before the thumb!
