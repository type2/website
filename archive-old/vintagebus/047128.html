&lt;&lt; well the case has already been bored out once, and i was told that it was 
not a good idea to bore it out twice(align bored) The crankshaft needs so 
much work to fix, i was told it would be cheaper to buy a new one, same for 
flywheel. plus if they were fixed they would be weaker. then the bearings are 
shot, the p&amp;c are borderline.&gt;&gt;

Hi Kevin,
Then it sounds like you only have the engine case as a good rebuild part of 
all of the above.  Engine cases can be bored in the main bearing bore four 
times .020&quot; (.5mm) for a total of .080&quot; (2mm).  So unless your engine case 
was really badly run to the point is was beat to death and/or badly machined, 
it should be still good.  Since new engine cases are over $300.00 and there 
is a good possiblity that VW is soon going to shut down ACVW production.....
 
&lt;&lt; what is worth saving is the oil cooler(although it is not a doghouse) my 
heads were good, camshaft, heads, i will try to save what is good.  &gt;&gt;

You mentioned that your rebuilder was just regrinding the used valves.  
Unless you know there is less 40,000 stress free miles on them it is not a 
good idea to reuse valves especially exhaust ones.  Valves are exposed to 
high tempertures (Again especially the exhaust ones!) and lots of 
tension/hammering.  This work hardens the valves and eventually the head 
snaps (Like a coat hanger sudden failure.) off the stem and the piston pounds 
it into itself and the head.  Often putting a hole in the piston and 
releasing bunches of shrapnel into the engine case and sucked into the 
bearings in a moment!
You can take a normal steel valve after 100,000 miles.  Put it in a vise and 
try hammering it into a L-shape.  It will snap off before bending much.  
Stainless steel valves in the same condition/mileage will bend bend nicely 
all the way into the L-shape.
  Your cam can possibly be regound and rehardened. Best to have the cooler 
cleaned.  Eric&amp;Barb
