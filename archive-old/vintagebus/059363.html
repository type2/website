&gt; HI to all just got around to checking and see if i had a big nut or small 
&gt; rear on my 66 21 window deluxe bus  like to know what is the difference in 
&gt; the two rears

Hi Angel,
If it is a 1964-67standard RGBs or the one year 63 one ton RGBs you have 20% 
stonger brakes and less reduction gearing than what was used as a standard in 
1955-63.

&gt; for those silly folks in group yes i know 10.mm difference ...but like to 
&gt; know if i'm going to be able and hit the highways with my bus or run the 
&gt; local roads.

That depends on the gearing of not only the RGBs but what gearing is in the 
tranny!  Buy or borrow a tach for a fifteen minute drive and write down where 
1,500 and 3,000 RPM are in each forward gear.
