Subject: Re: [VB] Good primer

I have used zinc primer and so far it has worked the best. I used it on
those areas that were stripped or sanded down to bare metal. All the rest
was just primed with regular stuff...... for now at least.

&gt; I am doing body repair to my daily driver. I am able to work on small
&gt; sections at a time. I have repaired quite a lot but those
&gt; repaired/primered sections have started to rust after only one time
&gt; in the rain. I used a phosphoric acid solution then a standard
&gt; autobody rattlecan primer. I have read in the archives that zinc
&gt; primer is the way to go. Those archive posts are from a few years
&gt; ago. Is zinc still the standard bearer or is there a new and better
&gt; solution?
