Subject: 74 sunroof SB for sale

anyone looking for the last-year german-made sunrooof superbeetle, 
come on down!
an E-series, no less... whatever that means.
runs, clear title, not tagged or inspected right now.  that hasn't 
stopped the PO from driving it daily on the highway!
  engine makes a flapping sound that i can't track, but sounds 
external to the motor (fan?). minor rust on rear pillars, smushed 
hood. i'm sure some more if we dig around. sunroof works and doesn't 
leak.
located in austin tx, $800 OBO.

someone buy it, cuz i need the cash to buy a 66 benchseat bus with 
european speedo and lights a friend just said he wants to sell me!!!
