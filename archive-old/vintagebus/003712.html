Hey there!

     I'm looking for a solution for a carb icing problem I'm having with my
65 bus.This only used to happen during the first few blocks of driving , but
now robs big chunks of power in the occasional cool damp weather here in the
Northwest. It seems to get worse after driving for a while on the freeway
and especially going up hill. A couple years ago I installed one of those
new 1600 dual port engines from Mexico. At the same time, I purchased one of
the Weber progressive carb systems sold by Scat.This is a single carb with
intake system. It comes with a big massive aluminum intake manifold which is
heated by a normal size intake manifold heater tube . Maybe you can or can't
help me with this carb, but maybe you can tell me what is working well for
you. Sorry though, I don't want to use dual carbs. I don't want to have to
synchronize them or mess with the complexity.

Any ideas?
Thanks,
Neil Sundberg
