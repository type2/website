&gt; what problems did they encounter, do you know?

They just told me manufacturing problems.  Maybe it left the tubes to
thin?  Or maybe the surface needed to be heat treated to not be chewed up
by the needle bearings?  Maybe they can elaborate.  It sounded like a good
thing to me too.  I bought a front end to use and now it sits, but I may
find a use for it.
