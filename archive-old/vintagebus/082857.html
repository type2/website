Subject: passed emissions, but some questions.

once again the 70 passed emissions, and once gain i am puzzled... 
AFAICT, the damn thing is too rich, yet was within specs. to wit: my 
aircooled_dot_net a/f meter is PEGGED at full rich - leftmost blue light 
ALWAYS on - with the jet combo that passes. the exhaust also stinks 
like the texas gulf coast (that means &gt;lots&lt; of  petrostink). SP, vac 
adv dizzy, 1679cc, 30/31 pict, sorta-engle 100 cam, 125 main, 125 
emulsion, 65 idle and pilot jets.  readings:
HC in PPM: loaded  - 178;   idle - 282 (&lt;500 to pass).  CO in 5: 
loaded - 3.77;  idle - 4.34 (&lt;4.20 and 5.5 to pass).

so my question is am i  too lean according to these ratings? i was 
led to believe that too low a reading means too lean. and if so, how 
on earth can that be so considering the high reading on the afm? 
while i get great acceleration and low head temps with this jet 
combo, mileage is fer crap. do i go up in main size, and find some 
emulsion tubes that pass more air at speed???

personally, i would rather do brain surgery on myself with a 
butterknife than prank with the carb :P prolly have better results, 
too......

ps - the folks at the testing center had no CLUE how to drive a 
stick; i once again had to do the 'transient test,' and the first 
lady gave up. the next guy had to do it 3 times before getting it 
right, as he couldn't get from 3rd to 2nd w/out hitting reverse! he 
finally just left it in 3rd, which lugged the crap outta the engine 
in several places - i saw the tach hit 1K at one point :P  engine 
took it in stride and never went over 150 oil, 325 head temps, never 
less than 40 psi.
my revenge is that the idiots failed to close the engine hatch while 
testing, and the entire building was filled with an UNGODLY roar for 
a good 20 minutes. most employees left!
