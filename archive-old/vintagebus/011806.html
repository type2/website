First off, thanks to all who sent me (and my bus) get well messages.  
You guys are great!!  I'm doing much better, I just got caught up on the 
classwork I missed - never get in an accident and miss your first week 
of college - it sucks.
I talked to the insurance company today, they want to write off my bus.  
Damn.  But at least they say it should be ruled the other guy's fault, 
unless he manages to come up with some story of what happened that is 
different from mine.
So now I get to play the waiting game, and take the %^&amp;*&amp;#_at_ transit bus.  
I can't really look for a new bus until I get money from ICBC, which 
apparently could take months!!

Moral of the story:  Don't get distracted with feeling to see how your 
windshield wiper switch mounts to the dash and drive through 
uncontrolled intersections.  It hurts.

Happy bussin' to everybody,
Diana
