 &gt;Its a 66 walk through standard built 1st November 65.  lotus white/ lotus
 &gt;white paint (uncommon) and mesh grey interior.  they started the 9 digit
 VIN
 &gt;in 65.  The first part of the Vin is the model, 2 (bus) 8 (walkthrough
 &gt;standard) which is the first two numbers in the first set of numbers in the
 &gt;bottom line if the m code tag. Its a typ 28, not a tvp 28.  The last set of
 &gt;numbers (7 digits) on the bottom line is the rest of the vin, the 6 means
 &gt;sixty -6- model year, and the rest is the serial number of yours, so your
 vin
 &gt;is 286 051 365, which is stamped in the plate on the side of the fresh air
 &gt;vent.
 According to Thom's fix in the registry it is not white over white but
 Torquoise over turquoise.  I found an old picture in the bus and I can just
 make out an all white bus. I'm assuming that my bus is white on white. Any
 help? thank you.

the 6 digit number on the bottom line of the m code tag is the colour code.

if yours is 424283- the 42 means lotus white  above and below beltline, the 
83 is the interior code for mesh grey.

if it was turquoise, the paint code would be -- wow also 42,  however, that 
was not offered on stanadard micros as turkois/turkois, also turquoise was 
available only march 61 through 64 model year, NLA for a 66.  So by context 
you can tell the 42 means lotus white, not 6turquoise.   BTW mesh grey was 
only offered 65 through 67 model years.
