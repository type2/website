I called my &quot;Local Porsche dealer&quot; a couple of months ago with all the
part numbers etc.  The price was between $150 and $200.  Don't know what
other Porsche dealers may charge, but I don't think I'll bother calling
the one in my town anymore.  Bergman never replied.  I think Parts
Obsolete sounded good from what I remember.  I think Pelican Parts
referred me there because they didn't deal with 356s.
