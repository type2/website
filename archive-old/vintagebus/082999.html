Subject: Re: [VB] VW want to remove entusiast site

I could list literally hundreds of other manufacture enthusiasts sites that 
are not persecuted like VW hobby sites are.  Those manufacturers DO NOT sue 
their enthusiast!!  They realize the incredible VALUE that the hobby market 
can generate in future sales.  VWAG is very short sighted in their attempt 
to keep their sacred &quot;intellectual property&quot; safe.  Future sales will 
hopefully show the error.  Realistically though, the hobby market is a drop 
in the bucket.
