Thom, can you please pass this on. Thanks, Brian. Make plans for Ground Hog=
 Day Weekend- Feb 1st 2nd and 3rd to drive to Mt. Shasta the long way... th=
rough the woods, up and over the mountains and across the streams where ice=
 fishing, skiing/snowboarding=
, train watching and awesome scenery abound. Several hundred miles of very-=
very-back road driving from Guerneville Ca. to Mt. Shasta will take the who=
le day (drivers from north can meet up halfway and those north of Mt. Shast=
a are charged with mapping a=20=
route of equally challenging secondary roads southward to Mt. Shasta). Can =
your excellent bus make the trip? Do you have the mechanical savvy if you b=
reak down 100 miles deep in the Mendocino National Forest? Were you smart e=
nough to have left your origi=
nal heat exchangers in place, knowing that being cool is not being cold? Ev=
er put snow chains on your bus not because it was mandated for passage over=
 I-80, but because if you didn't have them on you'd be stuck? Caravan throu=
gh the woods with us on this=20=
second annual Mt. Shasta Snow Trip for the best bus adventure you've ever b=
een on! (do you really think driving freeways for hours on end in your bus =
is adventure?) Check last year's web site for more details as to what we're=
 up to here. www.sonic_dot_net/~m=
izamook/Shasta1htm Know that this trip is not for the weak. Most drivers un=
fortunately, are quite afraid of driving their busses as they were designed=
... over the roads of third world countries. While &quot;slammed&quot; busses may sui=
t the image-conscious land an=
d mind-locked city dwellers with related mental problems, stock suspension =
and ride height are needed to cross some of the minor streams and occasiona=
l radical road conditions. If you have the metal, this trip is for you. Wri=
te to me for more information=
. This ones for those who put function over form! Thanks, Brian.=20
