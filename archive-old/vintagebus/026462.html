Chet - 2 things come to mind.
First, check and see if there's an intake leak at the carb/manifold
junction and again at the intake manifold/head junction.  Just start the
bus, get it to run at a constant speed and spray WD40 or something
similar at those places.

If nothing found there why not tale it back to who did the rebuild?
