Your rite Steve no indents but thats a bit picky in my view , why cut out the 
top area and put the indent in when they fit with out it and we didn't even 
beat the dash or anything ,,but if he wants the indents in them ,i'll damn 
sure fab them and put them in. I'd love to see the pics of the indents ,then 
if a owner wants them there i'll do it , your only limited by your 
wallet,,the plates are there to spread the load of the screws across the top 
frame area not just the small section where most people put only sheetmetal 
screws. Alot of folks run them that way and it works ,,its their call, i just 
supply what is needed to support them the way vw did. If nobody wants them 
,no biggie thats just one less thing for me to mess with . At the price i 
charge i'm not makin jack on them,,thats the way i look at it.    Later
