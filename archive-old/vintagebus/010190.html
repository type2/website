me too,  me too!!!  The black top on mine (the pump) is soooo bad that every
time I touch it another piece falls out.  I hear they are really hard to
find (although I have not started looking yet).

&gt; I would like to by a washer bottle for the 67. I guess it's a one year
only
&gt; 12v washer bottle:) Just kidding. Mine has was broken when I got the bus.
I
&gt; thought of trying to repair it but the plastic seems so brittle if I glue
&gt; mine back together it will prolly crack somewhere else.
