Now, this is my own person observation, but any crankcase that can't hold its
oil has a serious problem in assembly. While in Fairbanks Alaska for a year in
1976 with a 64 40hp bug, I used Mobile 1 in the aged engine and a 50/50 mix of
silicone MP1 and 90wt in the tranny. I had the occasional notorious spot on
the pavement like all dubs I've owned with no difference in oil usage. If you
leak that much with Mobile 1 which has the viscosity of 20wt oil then you
might consider cracking the block and doing a reseal and retorque.

Here's my vote...
Oil - Castrol HD 40 WT.....tried Mobil 1 once, but the sumbitch leaked like a
sieve with that stuff, so I went back to the Castrol.  From VanBondo's
estimated 30-35K and my mileage, the 1600DP is at approx. 65-70,000 miles.
