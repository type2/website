Subject: Re: [VB] RE: What's that black flaky stuff on my brake shoes??

I wouldn't trust any tire store with a king pin/link pin alignment job.
They won't have a clue how to do it. You're better off doing it
yourself. The idiot book has the information you need to get the right
number of shims and I'm sure there are other good sources of that info.
You can do it with just a couple of good rulers, a couple of cheap yard
sticks (for the toe in), and common tools.
