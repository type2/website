Craig writ:

&gt;motor is AIR cooled. What I mean by this is if your oil is getting
&gt;too hot, just cooling your oil is only going to help your head
&gt;temps a little. I would love to see a test on this. Have someone
&gt;actually see if an oil cooler and deep sump really lowered
&gt;cylinder head temp by very much. If
&gt;your head temps go through the roof but you have enough oil
&gt;cooling to keep your oil cool you are still going to see longevity
&gt;isssues.

That is exactly my take on the issue. A larger oil cooler is merely
symptomatic relief.
It does not solve the root problem, it's like a boat with a hole in it, you
can get a bigger pump
to keep up with the leak, but it's better to plug the hole.
Compression ratio and fuel mixture are the places to address over-heating
issues. Once those are correct,
extra cooling becomes unnecessary. My 2110 was built with low compression
and the carbs are jetted a little rich.
It only heats up above 78 mph with a 3.88 R&amp;P, .82 4th gear and a stock
doghouse oil cooler. Even then the oil temp
doesn't exceed 230.
