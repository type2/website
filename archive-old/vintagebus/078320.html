&gt;Hi all - What, if any components from an H case sp 1500 with an
&gt;alternator can be fitted on a new 1600 dp longblock?

It depends.  :)

Tom Wilson's &quot;How to rebuild your Volkswagen air-cooled engine&quot; has
a pretty good chapter on part ID and interchange.

&gt;One is an H case 1500 sp with a single carb, vac advance, good heater
&gt;boxes, new muffler, fuel pump, and alternator

Off the top of my head:
The carb can go to the new 1600dp, possibly with different jets.
The distributor can probably be used.
The heater boxes, muffler, fuel pump, alternator can be used.

The 1600dp will probably be set up for a doghouse oil cooler, so you
may need to get a doghouse fan shroud (and matching fan) at least.
Much of the rest of the tin may be reusable.
The clutch may be reusable.

The intake mainfold won't be reusable.  You'll have to get a DP one.

&gt;The other is an X case type3 motor 1600 dp, with dual Kadrons, and a
&gt;full flow oil filter. [...]  009, old generator, rotted heater boxes,
&gt;holy exhaust, etc.

The carbs and manifolds can go to the new 1600dp.
The 009 can be used, but the vac advance one from your 1500 might work
better.
The generator can be used if you want to.

The type3 tin is all different, so you can't use any of that.

&gt;Any advice is appreciated

Just from what you've said here, the 1500 sounds like it runs better,
but its unknown history might count against it.  It also has more parts
you can reuse, which helps keep the cost down now, and may make it
easier to swap back to this one in the future.

Since they're both on the ground, you can check to see if there is too
much thrust (end-play) on either crankshaft.  You might even consider
pulling one or both heads on each engine to take a look at the valves
and the tops of the pistons, to see what that tells you.
