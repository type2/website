&gt;Thom can you re-explain to a first time painter what you mean by this:
&gt;&quot;You *can* use POR-15 on the body, *if* you prime it while it's still wet&quot;

&gt;I would imagine if the por-15 is still wet, the nextr layer of apint won't
&gt;stick properly.

The instructions say you can (should) paint the primer on while the POR-15
is still tacky.  Once it dries, you can't sand that stuff, and nothing will
stick well to it.  I waited until it was just tacky enough that fingers
would leave an impression, then sprayed rattle-can primer on it.  The
filling primer seemed to be OK with sticking to that.
