Since moving to Florida, having a car with a good heater isn't as big a 
priority as it used to be.  We are looking sell one of out H20 VW's and add 
another Air Cooled VW to the fleet.

Looking for a solid splitty.  Prefer something in the '55 - '61 range but 
will consider any year deluxe sunroof or something unique - Double Door 
Kombi, Sunroof Standard, Binz, etc.  Will consider anything except a single 
cab (3 kids)

Thanks,
Dan
