&lt;&lt; I have heard that towing a bus which has a transmission but no engine is 
not good on the transmission.  Has anyone else heard of this?  Is it true and 
if so, how
 does one tow without causing damage? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Only by having the tranny in gear and/or without oil can you damage it while 
towing!   Eric&amp;Barb
