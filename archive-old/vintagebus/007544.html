Subject: Re: [VB] Blowing oil

Had the same thing with my 1776cc engine.  Are your valve covers vented?
I'm guessing not.  There is a kit sold (Empi/Bugpack?) with all the
fittings, hoses, puke box, etc. for about $50.  I installed that and it
totally ended my problems.  Drove my Crew cab from FL to CO this last August
and the engine compartment was dusty when I got there.  I'll never build
another engine without one.

Subject: [VB] Blowing oil


&gt; I recently purchased a 1961 camper with an engine that had been rebuilt by
&gt; Andy Brown Automotive in Utah.  New engine is 1910 cc w/ dual Weber carbs.
&gt; Probably too much power for this van.  An external oil cooler and oil
filter
&gt; were also added.  Anyway I had the vehicle inspected prior to shipping to
&gt; Massachusetts and there were no issues.  After running it a day or two I
&gt; noticed oil in the engine compartment, a thin layer everywhere.  I
tightened
&gt; all connections to the oil cooler etc, but still oil in the compartment
&gt; after each use.  Any thoughts out there?  Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.  Don.
