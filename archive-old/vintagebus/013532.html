Who should I send my Volkswerks tranny to for re-rebuiling?  I accidentally
deleted the number for the place in So-Cal that was recommended a few days
ago on the list and they claimed to have a 2 week turn around time.  That
would be nice !  Pardon me if anyone's bored with this problem I'm having.
