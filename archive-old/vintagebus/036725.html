&gt;&gt;Have 35mm fan, type 4 cooler, 

I have questions regarding this fan story.

1. Where does one measure the fan to determine its width - blades or overall
including the 'ring'?
2. What is the 'fattest' fan one could fit into a stock doghouse
shroud/alternator combination without serious
mods.
3. What would the 'fattest' suitable fan have been fitted to originally?

TIA

Michael
