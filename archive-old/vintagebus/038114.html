What if I want to keep the ride height on my truck but would like higher 
gears.
Different gears for the RB? different R&amp;P? Where can I get them?
What have you or someone you know done?
 -- - - - - - 
what is your gearing now?  you want it higher than what?

beg borrow buy or steal a tach, you can hook it up sitting n the font seat, 
so you can return it easily.   Find 2K and 3K rpms in each gear (well, ignore 
2K for 1st if you like).     Post these findings to the list.

Does your truck have 36mm or 46 mm rear axle nut?  The 36s are 1.39 reduction 
and the 46 is 1.26 reductions.    Keep the brakes from the same all the way 
round, dont put bigger brakes on the back unless you change the front too.

with a 3.875 r&amp;p and 1.26 reduction GBoxes and a .82 4th, the speedo reads 57 
or 58 at 3K rpms in 4th.     I fiind this good for freeway driving.  I have 
big tires, so im actually going 61 or 62 or something like that .     

it costs more to get a 3.875 cause its more work assembling it and finding 
parts.   if your gearing is really low - 47mph in 4th at 3K (4.375 with 1.39s 
does about this)  i understand.  If you have a 4.12 and 1.26s I wouldn't 
bother unless the tranny is in need of help.  

Also, a tranny swap and taking the axles off and switching is a lot of dirty 
work, unless your truck is very clean underneath.  Then its just  lot of 
work.  

my 3 cents
