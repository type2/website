&gt;After a hot weekend of futzing around in and under my '67 Deluxe,

Um.  You're in north Illinois, right?  NWS says Chicago got to
90 degrees over the weekend.  90 degrees is not hot.  It hit
101 here (Tulsa) on Friday and 97 on Saturday.  Around 70 to 90%
humidity to go with those numbers.

&gt;2) Voltmeter:  Pops right up to a bit about 12 volt when I turn on
&gt;the key.  [...]  When I start the engine, the gauge goes up to about
&gt;15 volts and pretty much stays there.  I take it my voltage regulator
&gt;is not properly regulating?

Maybe.  A fully-charged 12 volt car battery will read 12.6 volts with
no load.  I'd expect the reading to be just a bit lower with the key
on and engine off, especially if the points are closed.  In the Bentley,
VW lists no-load regulating voltages for various 12 volt generators at
13.6-14.5 V and load regulating voltages at 12.8-13.6 V.

If your regulator was totally gone I'd think you'd see much larger
changes in the indicated voltage, especially as you rev the engine.
It could just be that the voltmeter isn't particularly accurate -
the 15 V reading is within 3.5% of the highest no-load reading
specified by VW and 3.5% might be a good accuracy for this kind of
gauge.  Have you got a VOM or DMM that you can test it against?  

If you do find that it reads consistently high, you can probably
wire a resistor inline with the gauge to bring its reading back
down to reality.  A consistently low reading is harder to fix.

&gt;Oil pressure drops off not only at idle, but at low rpm (like 45 
&gt;mph in 4th gear when decelerating).  Runs at about 20 psi at 50-60
&gt;mph.

VW called for 28.5 psi at 70 degrees C (160 F) and 2500 RPM on
the 1500.  What weight oil are you running?  Are you sure you
got the right spring and plunger for the second oil valve?  Are
both springs and plungers stock?  You might be able to answer
your &quot;did I put in a new oil pump&quot; question by pulling the 
crankshaft pulley and oil pump cover - the wear marks on the
inside of the oil pump cover should tell you.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
