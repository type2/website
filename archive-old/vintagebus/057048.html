&gt; I always miss out on all the fun!!  You guys must

&gt; the time I get home from 
&gt; work.  But I guess I will reply since Mike
&gt; (turkisbus)said yesterday that I 
&gt; never reply.

Its not that you won't or don't reply, but everyone
answers for you. There the ones who get the whole
thing going again.
