Er- maybe that's my excuse for not doing the body resto work on my buses.    
See my 61 with rust holes, ancient bondo, and bad paint at KP.  (and the red 
barn)

 And a certain 56 westy in my garage?
 Not to mention my 57 standard is mid-tranny swap.
 Kelly Park baby!

 &gt; in addition I'd say that I've seen people give on on projects because they

 the

dough 
 &gt; building something.   Then you have the stylee split to drive, and can see 
 &gt; what it does and doesn't.
