&gt; &gt;I need help!!!  I have a 64 Westfalia with a flip hatch(if that is what
&gt; it is called).  I am in the process of restoring the bus but I am having
&gt; problems finding information and parts for the hatch. If you have any info
&gt; or know of any place where I can find parts, I would really appreciate the
&gt; help.

On that same note I'm looking for any flip hatch piece. I have the opening,
etc. I just need the piece that flips up............
