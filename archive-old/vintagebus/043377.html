&gt;Just bought a bus. The PO drove it only once a month
&gt;for the past 2 years. The tank is about 40% full of
&gt;gas which is over a year old.

Get rid of it.  Get a 5 gallon jug, drain the gas into
that, and then either use it in your lawn mower or take
it to the &quot;household hazardous waste day&quot; that many
communities have now.

Get a carb gasket kit, pull the carb off, take off the
top, and check inside the float bowl.  If it's clean,
OK, but if it's not, soak it in a bucket of carb cleaner
and put the kit in it.

The '74 Bug my Dad now drives sat outside for two years
and the gas was definitely bad in it.  The tank outlet
was plugged solid and the carb float bowl had 1/2&quot; (1cm)
of solid gunk in the bottom.  We had to run it through
the carb bucket a couple of times to get it completely
clean.  The old gas that we drained from the tank
wouldn't even burn in the lawnmower.

Even at today's prices, $20 for a tank of fresh gas and
$5 for a carb kit is a *cheap* investment to keep yourself
from chasing your tail trying to figure out why it
won't run right.  It is also a good time to replace the
rubber fuel lines and check the metal one(s) for corrosion
and possible clogging.

Good luck!
