They make a head stud that has an over-sized, self-tapping
thread on the 'case' end, for just your problem. You double
nut the 'head' end, and screw the other end into the case.
When you get it threaded into the case to the proper point,
the double nuts are removed and a single nut is tightened to
the proper torque.

These where common in the hayday, might be a problem today.

The only other option is a case saver.

Good luck.

&gt; Hey, I noted a exhaust leak between #2cylinder and head and just checked the
&gt; bolt torque.  Results:none, I thought it must have really loosened up, but
&gt; after 2 turns I started to wonder and sure enough the stud was coming out of
&gt; the case.  Any ideas what to do?
