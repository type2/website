 Something timely on the list as always.......I was looking at a similar 
 subject last night. I have a pair of panel van cargo doors - 211 841 
 081C and 211 841 091C. I checked my parts list and it said from chassis 
 no. 705 620 (Dec '60) to 1 019 924 (Oct '62) The next revision listed 
 for these part numbers was F - which said for 'reinforced locking bars' 
 
 Does this mean that the locking bars (latch rods) changed in '62? What 
 happened to D and E part number revisions?
  &gt;&gt;
It means there were D and E versions, but they were physically interchangable 
with the F version, and they no longer carried the D,E at the time your parts 
list was updated.   They do this with many many parts.  some times the part 
is physically changed and they do not change the parts number if there are no 
functional changes.  THe regular and reinforced sliding window latches take 
the same part number as each other (if they are from the same side).   I have 
seen dif taillights with the same part number.    etc etc.  this is why I 
like having different editions of parts lists, as the later versions have 
lots of supersessions, while the earlier ones list more of what was 
originally put on the car.  Consulting a late 60s edition re stuff for a 36hp 
motor might give you dif info than consulting a 58 edition.
