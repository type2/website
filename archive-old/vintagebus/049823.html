&gt;&lt;&lt; I have eight rims, all 14&quot; and would like to keep them but want to know if
&gt;they are all the same. Some have 5JK X 14 stamped on them and some don't have
&gt;that.&gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Andre,
&gt;If the rims you have are 14&quot; type they are for the 1964-1970ish bus.  T1, and
&gt;1955-early 1964 buses used a 15&quot; rim.    Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;


14&quot; rims could also be from a Thing, which I think have different offset
than Bus rims.  Measure from the mounting surface on the back side to the
back edge of the rims by putting a straight edge across the back of the
wheel.  It they're all the same, they're all Bus rims.
