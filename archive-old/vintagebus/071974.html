Hi Mike,
Best to leave the wiring harnees in place and fix it there.  The less you 
pull and yank the wires the better it will be, and you can tear the outer cover 
all too easily.  We have pulled wiring harnesses out of very dead buses and 
they often do not come out in perfect shape, but since we are harvesting the 
individual wires themselfs that is not a big problem.
  As for the trailer wire you will need to drill at least two holes and 
grommet them for this to pass through.  Check out VW grommets for this!  That way 
if these grommets ever fail you can easily replace them.
