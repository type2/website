I also did the same. Only it's for my wife. We bought a 83 Westfalia 
Vanagon. It's a 4 spd though.
BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!I still have the 78 Westy. Now to put his and hers above 
the garage doors.

&gt;I went out last night and bought a 87 westfalia vanagon, with automatic and

&gt;This is so that Jan feels happy driving it across country.
&gt;I guess that it is better than a new eurovan, or a Dodge caravan!
