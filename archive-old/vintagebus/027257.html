OK...here's the skinny on things..
The pressure plate that is in there now is a big honkin 3 arm wirh no round springs
on it.  I don't need a ring on it as they changed the T/O bearing and trans in 71.
It is the same setup now, as when I got the bus originally....it worked then.
The PP that I changed to was a big honkin 3 arm...but it had 9 little round springs
around it for more holding pressure, it wasn't the kind with all of the little
fingers.

I've tried putting washers on the end of the bowden tube...but that doesn't help...

maybe it is the needle bearing....but it shouldn't grab that hard.

I don't know... I called up Crusty (aka Brian Holcomb if you've ever heard of him) he
and his father are into VW's... and he has some nice rides (the 61 single cab in the
&quot;50 years of the bus&quot; issue is his)...so he said to call him back...maybe he'll know.

later,
