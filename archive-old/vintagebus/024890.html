Well all 3 of my bullis are bench seat models so I geuss I'm partial to them
but here is why.
    1)My two daughters dont have to argue who gets to sit upfront with dad!
    2)Two extra beds for camping,the bench and the hammock(tho the hammock can
still be used in the walk-thru).
    3)Where would I keep all my crap if I didn't have the middle section of the
bench.
    4)Adjusting pass. side mirror while driving is a bear w/o bench seat!
    5)Can't fit entire baseball team in bus with walkthru.
    6)While camping and the divider curtain pulled the Mrs's and I can #$%#
while the kids are snoring up front!! 2 rooms

well after very little deliberation the jury has chosen bench seats do in fact
rule. #6 makes is hard to beat!!
