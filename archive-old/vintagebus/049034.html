We're finally getting close to painting the bus.  I'm hung up on an originality paint issue, that maybe I shouldn't concern myself with, but would still like to know the answer if anyone knows for sure.  I've seen mention of it before on the list, but I searched the archives and found myself lost in a sea of painting posts.

I know that with later two-tone buses, i.e. mid '60's, the entire bus was first painted the lower half color and then the upper half was sprayed with the top color.  The question is, did VW do this on all two-tone buses, even during the '50's, or was there a year split when they started painting in this fashion?

Bottom line, should I paint my entire bus Mango Green and then spray the top half with Sea Gull Grey, or just paint below the beltline with Mango and above the beltline with Grey?

TIA.

Robert
