&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 I am curious. What happens if you cut the divider. Do you lose structural
 integrity? Walkthrough's don't have the divider and that is stock. Is there
 something special about walkthrough's? I am mostly curious and it may be the
 only way a bus will get salvaged. I am considering making a panel into a
 camper with swivel vanagon seats.
 
 Please no sermon's about how wrong it is to modify etc... 
  &gt;&gt;
what happens is you will get lotsa emails saying how it's a bad idea to chop 
a bus, and surely not the only way a bus could be saved.   Bet it's easy to 
find one already cut if that's what you want, or find a walkthrough.   If you 
live near Oly, WA I know of a couple splitties that have been hacked like 
that.
