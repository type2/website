PAcking away a bunch of parts is not a problem- I'm sure that even I
could handle that.  i also have years of experience of driving very old
buses around the country, some in states of disrepair that would scare
the shit out of most people.  Still, this experience leads me to believe
that your list is overkill, and a poor substitute for diligent
maintenance.  Sure- the craziest and most unlikely things could happen,
especially with a bus, but Murphy's Law can probably be applied here- no
matter how well you prepare for something, it will end up being something
else....   so- we've established that our opinions differ.  Big deal...

Happy bus driving,
