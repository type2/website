&lt;&lt; What's the best replacement clutch arm in a 67?&gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
If you mean the throw out arm that the clutch throw out bearing rides on.  
Then the best is one that has the arms bead welded to the arm, not just 
spotwelded together.

 What's the best cost effective replacement?
Not sure what you mean.  As always do it yourself is best.

&lt;&lt;How much play should I feel in the transaxle input shaft? &gt;&gt;
Quite alot.  Probably about +/- of almost 1/4&quot; measured at the end.
