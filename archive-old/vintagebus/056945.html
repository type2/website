Subject: Naming questions....

Hi List,
I know this is not exactly bus content, but we got a
new puppy (Chinese pug) and I was hoping the list
might help name him. I want a Volkswagen type name for
him, something bus related, and if not, then at least
something VW. If preferred, you can respond personally
rather than on the list.

Thanks everybody!!!!

3DPete
