&gt; 
&gt; Proper valve adjusting etiquette requires that you not drink Tequila
&gt; until
&gt; after the blessed event...
&gt; ...Assuming you have positioned
&gt; the
&gt; engine on TDC for #1, you may commence alternately adjusting valves
&gt; and
&gt; slamming brew. Lather, rinse, rotate counterclockwise 180 degrees,
&gt; and
&gt; repeat on each of the other three.

I'd hate to see my results by the time I got to #4 with this procedure!
:)

Of course, while adjusting the valves of my BMW motorcycle, I can sit
upright on a stool in a civilized fashion, place my beer on a nearby
parts tray, and consume comfortably.

Someone in this thread mentioned a different way of setting the valves
which involved less turning of the engine.  Has anyone tried this
method and then checked the results using the &quot;traditional&quot; method?  I
wonder if the base circle of the cam is really that round?
