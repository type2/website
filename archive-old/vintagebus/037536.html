Subject: Oregon VW's and gas
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was just in Eugene, Oregon last weekend and was very suprised to get 
attacked right when I got out of the car by some pump jockey to get gas. Is 
this law there? Very Strange from Illinois ways. I'll have to get used to it 
when I go to school there next fall. It's amazing at the number of aircooled 
vw's in Eugene(VW content). I was there for 3 days and saw a nice original 23 
window, gorgeous 21 window, all original sub-hatch westy, white single, a 
cool dormobile, worker panel, every baywindow ever made (prob saw 25), and 
bugs everywhere. This is just driving around the university of oregon and 
through some neighborhoods.

I was in VW heaven compared to the #'s here in IL (if they have the lower 
half of the body!)

anyway---
thanks--Pete
