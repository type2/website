Subject: 2 campers in Santa Barbara

Hey listees!

2 64 vans in Isla Vista for sale:
Looks like sundial campers, both running, one painted, one not.  The guy

is looking for $5000 between the 2.
If anyone is interested I can take a look for you since they are close
to home for me.
The number to call is 805 685-1264 or 805-967-0341. The guys name is
Willy.
    THESE ARE NOT MY VANS!!!  I will gladly inspect them though.
Good Hunting!
Jon McCabe 65 soon to be camper
