Subject:  solid tow hitches and towing question
Date: Fri, 30 Jun 2000 09:12:09 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings,

been reading the 'Dr Joes' tow hitch with
some interest as I have a couple of rolling
buses I need to move a modest distance (5 miles).

I will probably make a solid tow hitch this weekend
that will mount to the bumper bar iron mounts on
the bus chassis rails.  (I can take some pics along
the way if people want...)

Anyway, when you tow with these things do people generally
lock the bus's front wheels in the 'straight ahead' direction
(by tying off the
steering wheel or whatever) or leave them free?

thanks

RobK
