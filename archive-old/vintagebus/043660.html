&gt;Oh boy, I sometimes wonder why I get so into figuring out exactly what I 
&gt;own.  For about a year now, I've been pretty certain I own a Riviera 
&gt;camper.  [...] Recently enter a '58 &quot;Campmobile&quot; found in Arkansas with
&gt;the tell-tale picture window and an interior that mostly matches mine in
&gt;all the important places.  Does anyone have *any* information about the
&gt;Campmobile line?

I could be way out here, but I thought &quot;Campmobile&quot; was the VW model
name for pretty much any kind of camper, no matter who did the
conversion.  But, if VW only had one &quot;authorized&quot; camper conversion
company at a time, this explanation wouldn't hold.  Maybe the VW dealers
could still use the &quot;Campmobile&quot; model name, regardless of whether
it was an &quot;official&quot; conversion or a &quot;local&quot; conversion initiated
by the dealer.

An analogy *might* be the double-cab.  If you bought an early &quot;Double Cab&quot;
from VW, you got a converted-from-single-cab Binz, but later on, you got
one that was built by VW as a double-cab from the ground up.  Same
model name, but two different beasts.

Again, I might be talking out my exhaust port here, but maybe it will
help.
