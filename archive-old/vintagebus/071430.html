Subject: Anyone try to buy BRM's from a guy in Romania

I was bidding on some brms on ebay and this guy from romania was contacting
me during the auction telling me he had brms for $300. including the
shipping (2 days) to the states...

Sounds real fishy...

I asked him why he was selling them so cheap and gave me the story of his
little girl who is gravely ill and there is n treatment for her in Romania
and so he is selling everything he owns so he can travel through Europe to
find a cure...

I checked with UPS and they said 2 day shipping from there to here for
approx 100 lbs is over $ 700. not including duties..

I just wanted to know if anyone else has heard of such a ridiculous offer?


Thanks,

DM
