Subject: Re: [VB] Remove Cooling Fan

Hello Mike   I remove the fan while it is still on the motor. Use a gen 
pulley that has the flats on the hub instead of the type that has the two ears to 
mate the two pieces of the gen pulley  use a big cresant wrench on the pulley 
flats install a breaker bar with a 36 mm scocket onto the big nut on the back 
of the fan now turn the pulley end with the big creasant wrench to remove the 
36mm nut  then unbolt the gen strap ,wires ,carb,and the 4 housing bolts As you 
remove the gen  pull the fan off its hub and leave the fan in the housing 
till gen is removed, now remove the fan and check it for cracks mainly in the 
center  later and have fun    Mark Dearing
