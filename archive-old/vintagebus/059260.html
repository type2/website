&gt;    Tonight I finally got to dyno the 1800 type 1 engine. This is a 74 stroke
&gt; by 88 cut-ins, 7 to 1 compression, big valve duel port heads with duel
&gt; Kadrons. The dyno results are as follows
&gt; 
&gt; 2500 rpm  51.5  hp  108.19 ft lbs torque
&gt; 3000 rpm  60.6  hp  106.09 ft lbs torque
&gt; 3500 rpm  71.7  hp  109.24 ft lbs torque
&gt; 4000 rpm  79.2  hp  103.98 ft lbs torque
&gt; 4500 rpm  83.7  hp    97.68 ft lbs torque
&gt; 5000 rpm  85     hp   89.28  ft lbs torque
&gt; 
&gt; carb jetting   150 air  127.5 main  50 idle
&gt; 
&gt;     We found that the stock Kadron jetting is way to rich for the 1800 and
&gt; extremely rich for a 1600. Another problem is that we could of used a bigger
&gt; air correction, but decided to live with the 150. We also reset the
&gt; accelerator pump setting, The timing was set at 27 degrees total advance  at
&gt; first but advanced to 30 degrees, this added 3 hp.
&gt;    We tested the engine with a Thunderbird header with a junk EMPI (China)
&gt; tuck-a-way) muffler. Geoff Hart who did the dyno work (you have seen his
&gt; test in Hot VW's) said that if I used a better header (S-S) with a better
&gt; muffler (dyno max) we would gain approx 10 hp more and the equivalent in
&gt; torque.
&gt;    I designed this engine for a good torque band in the rpm range that most
&gt; of us drive our buses at. I have the same engine in my 1960 DD panel and
&gt; found it has a lot more pulling power then the 1776 that was in it
&gt; previously. 
&gt; 
&gt;   In the near future I am going to pull the 1800 out of my bus (14,000 plus
&gt; miles) and put it on the dyno (when we have more time) and do some more
&gt; exhaust test and carb changes to see what it produces, even after the miles.
&gt; 
&gt;   I learned a lot from Geoff about the importance of proper jetting and saw
&gt; HP differences in just what a little jet change can do. I have all the data
&gt; on each change and will post it to www.volksrescue_dot_com when I finally get
&gt; the site up and running
