Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth

Probably not, but the big truck tire places usually have the equipment to
balance the tires 'ON THE BUS'.  This is much better than balancing them off
the vehicle, and it costs about the same.  This is what I do, there is a
place just outside of town (Lafayette, LA)

&gt; You know, I just thought of it, but wouldn't most truck tire places be
able
&gt; to handle the wide five pattern with their equipment. just a thought.
