To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,
the Quotes I get for the sliding glass that rides in the frame on my 61
kombi's door are $35 and up. sorry I am picking up this old thread ( I
sorda remember it from a couple of mo.s ago...) I tried the archives but
always timed out. I have to get this thing California registered before I
ship it home.
could I find a big ole flat piece of laminated glass off of a commercial
vehicle at a junk yard and cut my own glass to fit? what thickness is it?
could any of you California listees tell me how picky the dmv is on
things like lamp inspection before registration? I put on a piece of tail
light repair tape from the FLAP.
will the dmv folks get weird about this? how about seat belts? my kombi
didn't come wid dem. do I haveta install em? 
what is the best way to pass this lamp inspection? have a cop come out
and look at it? or take it in to a certified inspection station or the
dmv?
the glass I got to go over the headlight is fluted or ribbed like a
fernell (sp?) lamp and the one on the other side that wasn't busted was
clear except for the edge. which is correct?
how can someone tell the difference between a bug bucket and a bus bucket
assembly?
