&gt;&gt;that accessory hatch is SWEEEET!!! airscoop too!
is every bus in so-cal slammed? ;)
&gt;&gt;
Yes, it's a law, although that guy is from NorCal.

Last time I was in SoCal with my Bus, the Police stopped me and asked why my Bus was so tall and was it possibly unsafe at that height?  I explained that I was from AZ and that we don't have paved roads so I was forced to leave my Bus at the dangerous stock height and that I would be leaving SoCal as soon as possible.  ;)
