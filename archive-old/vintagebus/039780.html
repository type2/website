&gt;hey thom why don't you make a &quot;ebay ,no ebay&quot; option?? so list
&gt;members can choose when they sign up if they want to recieve
&gt;ebay related messages or not??

Or you can just have all mail w/ ebay in the subject line to be 
automatically forwarded to your trashcan of your mail account.  At least you 
can do it in Hotmail.

Maybe I'd get more replyes if I posted ebay questions?
