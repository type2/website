&lt;&lt;  Can someone tell me what the &quot;name&quot; of that color is and if there is a
 paint mixing number for it?  It is a grey color but has a sort of greenish
 tint to it.  I have seen several double cabs in that color and have heard of
 several greys that apply to buses, but don't know which one I have. &gt;&gt;

I have heard it called mouse grey, and read along time ago in a Jeff Walters
article that they call it Dove Grey in the UK.

mouse grey  is L 325 and used on march 61 to july64 standards (with pearl
white)
there is also stone grey (L 221) used on barndoors but rarely, sand grey (L
260) used on march 55- july 58 standards but rarely, and even other greys.
The light bluey colour which I guess some people could call grey but I
wouldn't that was used on 50-67 commerical vehicles is Dove Blue (L31).

Light Grey  (L345) was available as one of seven standard paint colours
availble in the time range  aug 58 up to July 63  (though 3 colours were only
used part of that time )on commercial type 2s, so I figured a 61 would be that
grey if it was originally grey, if it was a non usual colour there would be a
different code.
