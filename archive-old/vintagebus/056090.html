Was writ: &quot;The head temp is only a part of the equation.&quot;

  OK, here's the basic facts as I see it:  The hottest part of the engine is
where the combustion takes place: the combustion chamber (cylinder head),
outer most part of the cylinders and the top part of the piston.  The motor
oil in an air cooled VW motor is heated primarily by passing through the
cyl. heads and then back to the case.
 So, if using dino oil, the oil temps are 'higher' but the heads are cooler
as
compared to syn. oil, the dino oil would still be the oil of choice.
If we can prove that syn. oil does in fact keep the &quot;heads&quot; cooler I'm all
for it.
The main part of the engine that must be cooled is the heads all else is
secondary.  If I had a head temp gauge I'd do the testing, I'll see if
Ronnie
has one in stock tomorrow.  Havasu's temp was well over 100 deg. today.
