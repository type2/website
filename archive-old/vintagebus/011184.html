&gt;  I just crawled out from under
&gt;  Ol'No Name and I have NO CLUE! Why the heat duct pipe
&gt;  that goes to the front of the bus from the back on the
&gt;  drivers side is capped off where the Y is at the end
&gt;  of the heat tube at the back?..Why would the left side
&gt;  just not hook into the duct work that runs to the
&gt;  front?......It hooks up to a joint that looks like the
&gt;  right side but it does not hook into the duct work
&gt;  running to the front????? Got a clue?...dont need the
&gt;  heat but what the heck!!!!
&gt;  
&gt;  =====

since you have a deluxe, half the heat goes up to the cab, and half is piped 
to emerge under the rear seat, so the passengers in the back stay warm.  In 
the commercial type 2s - the heat goes into both sides of the Y and goes up 
to the cab.  In the deluxes (and other passenger buses), the capped off one 
side, rather than going to the expense of making another piece there.
