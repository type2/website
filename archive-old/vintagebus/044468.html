Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Here in Southern California, if we waved at every bus we would have 
arm cramps. I typically reserve my waving for splitties because they 
are not as common (and I drive one). But if another bus driver waves, 
I always return the favor no matter what they are driving. My son and 
I love VW buses and we are always &quot;checkout&quot; splitties AND bays. (...)

&gt;Well, it's friday, so I guess I'm alright to ramble here for a 
&gt;spell.  This past Wednesday, I was cruising down Rt. 68 in Xenia, 
&gt;Ohio in my '66 Camper.  A buddy of mine was driving right behind me 
&gt;in my '83 Vanagon. We were returning from a rock-climbing trip in 
&gt;Clifton Gorge where we took a bunch of teen-agers from the YMCA teen 
&gt;camp.  Right outside of town, I see a nice blue and white bay window 
&gt;coming at me, nice bus.  So, of course I give a big, nice, friendly 
&gt;wave out the window.  I get NOTHING from the bay window driver.  I 
&gt;look in my rear-view and my buddy driving the Vanagon does the same 
&gt;as me, gives a big friendly greeting.  Again, NOTHING from the 
&gt;driver of the bay window! So, WTF?!?!?  This is the first time EVER 
&gt;that I have been in my bus and NOT gotten a wave from another 
&gt;passing bus driver.  Here in Ohio, air cooled buses are few and far 
&gt;between, and when I see another one on the road I get very excited. 
&gt;It's kinda like being told &quot;Hey, you're not alone out ther!
&gt;!
&gt;e!&quot; So, am I the only who feels like this when I see another bus on 
&gt;the road? Tell me there are more people who do... Oh my God, I'm not 
&gt;a freak am I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last 
&gt;question....
