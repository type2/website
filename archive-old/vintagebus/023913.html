Subject: Sunroof Kombi?

OK folks, I found a bus today that I have never seen before.  The bus
was a 1965 Kombi  bench seat with a factory installed sunroof!
Looking up at the roof of the bus from the inside(no headliner) you
could see the 8 skylight window frames as well as the sunroof frame. 
The skylights were not cut into the roof, but all the frame structure is
there.The sunroof looks and works like looks like a deluxe.  From the
outside it just looks like a plain old kombi but it has a sunroof minus
the skylights.  BTW the bus also has a belly pan and was painted blue
white/velvet green originally and only has 2 pop outs.

I quickly jotted down some numbers from the M-plate.

1 7
430 025 056 180
2252381783
5174370

I appoligize if some of the #'s don't match up.  From what I could get
from my few books, its an early 65 made on July 1 1965.  #430 = North
American export; 025= safety belts; 056= steering/ignition lock; 180=
without middle bank of seats; 225= Microbus?/loading doors on right,
sunroof (LHD); 2=?; 38= Velvet Green; 17= Blue White; 83= Mesh Gray
interior; 5=1965; 174370=chassis #??

What a combo!  A kombi with two tone paint and a sunroof, but with out a
middle seat.  Could this be right.  How rare?  Value?  No rust in pans
or rockers...some in front floors.  It needs a complete resto.  Good
mechanicals though.   Primered.

Thanks for any input!

Steve
