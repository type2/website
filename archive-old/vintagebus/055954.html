Subject: Re: [VB] Reverse spam: need gas cap


Don't have a gas cap for you but, I do have a DC that I plan to put a bay
tank in. I've got the bay tank and it appears to fit but, on my '65 there is
a vertical support in the middle of the truck where the cover plates for the
gas tank area fit.

On my DC this support is cut-out because I am replacing the cargo floor. I'm
not sure that you will be able to wrestle the bigger bay tank in around that
support or not.

&gt;   I don't know if I left it on a pump somewhere or
&gt; someone absconded with it, but I need one for my '59 DC.
&gt; Good used is fine.
&gt;   BTW- Does the Bay fuel tank swap work with Double cabs
&gt; too?
