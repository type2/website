&gt;195 is a mystery, and seems often used  on 62s and 63.   wonder if it

apeared

&gt;on euro spec buses?

My recently acquired 61 Westy has M195. No clue from the bus as to what it

might be. Bus also has mystery M358. This seems to be a package including

six side pop-outs with wide-opening latches, and safari windscreens.


M-tag lists the SO23 westy kit as J23. What does J stand for? Does anyone

have a list of what A23, B23 etc, meant? This bus is RHD, meaning the camper

kit is mirror image to the LHD set-up.


I notice that this bus has Sekurit glass all round. Maybe this has something

to do with M195???

I would ask Jim Bryant or was it Dave Easterwood about J23, one of them know 
s the early westy codes

hm- sekurit glass-  that's an interesting idea

FWIW my 65 westy has weird M codes and options, it has original safaris, but 
no codes for it, westy interior with white paint in back, white wheel 
&amp;column&amp;knobs on a kombi, but no westy M code.
