Subject: Re: [VB] Air shocks on a bus?

Eric,
	Air shocks would certainly give you an extra inch or two of ground 
clearance but this may not really help off road.  A big issue off road 
for non-4x4s is suspension travel and not ground clearance.  You want 
wheels dipping down and traveling up as far as possible in order to get 
some grip with a normal transaxle bus.  Air shocks probably restrict 
this movement.  I have an old Peugeot 504 that has only normal car 
ground clearance, but has incredible amounts of wheel travel.  I've left 
gutless 4x4 owners walking up jeep trails that the Pug has no problems 
climbing.  If you closely watch the next disaster in a former french 
colony on the TV news notice the middle class folks fleeing in their old 
Peugeots!   Gary Gibson
