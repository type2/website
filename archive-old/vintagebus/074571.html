Subject: por 15'd rims

Hi all,

I acquired a set of  bus rims which were in the bed of the 60 dc I 
recently bought.  They have been  por 15'd  by a po all around the 
hubcap side, and some of the por seeped and dripped around the top 
edges, into where the tire will sit,  and also the lug holes are 
completely covered.  I seem to remember a warning a while back about 
not messing with the surface of where the lug bolts sit, because 
friction could cause them to break down a coating of paint, or 
whatever, and loosen, leading to catastrophe.

I would like to put a set of tires on these soon, and was wondering 
what, if anything I should do to them to prepare them for mounting 
tires.

Any help appreciated :)


Thanks,
Don J
