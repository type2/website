Subject: 62 S/C F/S

Have the 62 single cab at the house for sale for owner who had to go
back to L.A. area. No motor, straight body and gates, though gates are
rusty at all the hinges, bed is rusty at the 4 corners, cab is original
vw grey and all stock panels. Out side is aqua color. Sum rust at top
drip rails. I would throw in a motor and drive this s/c everywhere.
Owner wants $900.00 but i think you can get it cheaper for cash. Email
your phone # and i will foward to owner. He has clean Calif. title
\and dosn't want phone # on the list. Thanks
John Howard
