&gt;      I myself have had great success taking and putting back together 
&gt; gauges.(airbrushed gauge faces are way cool)  It all started with a jewelry 
&gt; class I took in college.  Opening and closing gauges is a lot like setting 
&gt; a stone.  First, I beg of you to practice first on a scrap gauge till you 
&gt; get the hang of it.  Second, you will need an old screwdriver with a square 
&gt; shank.  The screwdriver shank only needs to be a couple of inches long.  
&gt; Grind a curve in the end of the shank, it should look like the round part 
&gt; of this U.  In jewelry terms, you just made your own bezel tool.
&gt;      To get things apart, you need a tiny screwdriver (slot head).  Start 
&gt; prying underneth the bezel a little at a time, you may go around 3 or 4 
&gt; times till there is enough room to pull off the glass and bezel.
&gt;      Once this is apart, you can do what you need to do.  I strongly 
&gt; recommend wearing rubber gloves to handle things when they are apart.  The 
&gt; oil in your skin, can really bugger up a gauge face.
&gt;      Once all that's done, it's time to get things back together.  With the 
&gt; glass and bezel back on, you can now take your bezel tool and start rolling 
&gt; bezel under the lip on the gauge.  It may take 3 or 4 trips around the 
&gt; bezel to get it seated.  If you live in a fairly humind climate you may 
&gt; want to put a little sealer on the bezel edge. Your done!
&gt;      I have found with practice, that I can rebuild a complete Speedo in 
&gt; about the time it takes to watch a foot ball game. I have saved numerous 
&gt; gauges from the scrap pile doing this and have saved quite a bit of money.  
&gt; 
&gt;                                                                 Peace,
&gt;                                                                    FW.Tyler
