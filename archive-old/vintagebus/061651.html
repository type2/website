Subject: Re: [VB] '59 SC....bed refurb

POR-15 works pretty well for filling in metal pinholes (I fixed up my
battery tray with it), particularly if you put a piece of tape
underneath.  Or for heavier-duty you might want to try their POR Putty,
which is like working with a congealed form of POR-15.

For bedslats you'll want a hard wood like oak so it resists getting
crushed or dented by your truck loads.  Considering how expensive oak
can be, even at Home Depot, and unless you're pretty good with your own
woodworking equipment to rip it into slats, you may just want to go the
money to buy a finished set of oak bedslats from Randy's (who now sells
through Wolfsburg West, we're told)--around $125 for a DC.  By contrast,
I've seen one example of a fellow on the east coast that uses homemade
pine slats with a square cross section in his SC--serviceable, but they
don't look as good.

FWIW whenever I'm carrying a real load like landscaping stones, I put
down a truck bedliner mat that I got at one of those Central
Tractor-type stores, around $60.  It's actually for a F*rd so it has cut
outs for the wheel wells, but it covers most all of the bed and is
pretty thick.

&gt; Now, I'm not looking for a perfect truck. But I would like to make it
&gt; look good since I'm gonna be painting it eventually. But i want to be
&gt; able to use the truck. So, what's the best way to fill the pits? Can
&gt; I use filler primer and let it build up, or even glazing putty or
&gt; something?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm mainly concerned about how well any kind of filling will hold up
&gt; if I haul stuff in there.
&gt; 
&gt; What have you guys done with your daily driver trucks?
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, anybody out there done a DIY wood slat job? Any budget wood
&gt; available at Home Depot or Lowe's that will work? Any suggestions
&gt; here would be great.
