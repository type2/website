I saw this guy at the Long Beach SOTO show,he has
complete harnesses for busses.

In Southern California.

WIRING WORKS
(310) 519-8147.

I'm not sure if his harnesses are 100% OEM colors, but
give it a try.

Note: I didn't buy his product, so I cannot endorse
him either way (positive or negative), so give him a 
call and find out I guess.
