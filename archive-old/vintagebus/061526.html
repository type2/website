&gt; Is anyone still running with an original bastard motor??  If you have one has 
&gt; it been rebuilt.  How about dependability??

a friend of mine has a 1959 westy with a bastard 40 horse. i do not know if the motor has been rebuilt but i doubt it; the bus is low-mileage, original paint and in excellent condition through out.  my friend doesn't drive his bus much but he does drive it around some.  the last longish trip he took in the bus was about 70 miles one-way.  when i enquired about whether he was afraid of breaking down on the way back home, he replied with a rev of the motor and a &quot;nope.&quot;

i'd drive it 'til it breaks!

cheers,
