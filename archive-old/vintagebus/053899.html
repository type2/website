Hi AL,
Good to hear you figured out the valve lash!  Sounds like you have two 
differant haeds or they were flycut or shimmed differantly.  You really need 
to take off the heads ASAP and figure out if you need to shim under the 
cylinders or get a matched pair of heads.  If you put too many miles on the 
engine you will not be able to shim under the cylinders without scrrewing up 
the rings.  25 lbs. is way to much of a differance on a new engine and since 
they are so even of a differance......   Eric&amp;Barb
