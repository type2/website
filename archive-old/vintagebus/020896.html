Subject: Contest Subject lines

Don't know if this has been asked yet about the
contest, but does the
subject line count in the 5 words per message?

EXCELLENT question asked by AJ.

All subjects to read &quot;re:Contest 5Word&quot;

Keeping all of the subject lines as &quot;re:Contest 5Word&quot;
without the quotes will keep them all in the same
thread for archiving, keyword searches, judging and/or
deletion of those who choose not to read them. It also
makes it more challenging.

If you are going to a show such as Familienfest or
others then do what you can before you leave-on
Friday.
The point is to have fun.
