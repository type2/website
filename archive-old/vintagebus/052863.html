Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Rack Uprights/Stantions

Thats odd, I have heard that PIP racks were very nice.
No one I know has complained.
 Mike

I've
&gt; considered going the repop PIP route, but I haven't
&gt; heard many good things about PIP racks or their
&gt; components.
&gt; 
&gt; Cash or parts to trade.  Thanks in advance.
