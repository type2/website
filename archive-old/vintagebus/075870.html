Subject: Re: [VB] Speedo Issue

Taylor - 
I have had the square hole in the dust cover &quot;round out&quot; on me, so that it is 
not touching the cable and driving the speedo anymore. The good news is, the 
dust covers for the pre-disk brak bays will work fine, so you should be able 
to find a new one in the pick and pull, if that is the problem . . .

Good luck and happu VWing -
Greg
