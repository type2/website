Subject: Engine Compartment Seal Question

List:

Year of bus: early 1959

My recollection of original engine compartment seals is that the corners are mitred and glued/welded together.  Yet, the new aftermarket seals not only come in 4 pieces, but also seem to have a different profile.

Question 1: Was there a year change on the profile and installation of engine compartment seals, just as the front door seals changed around '63ish?

Question 2: Were the early ('59) engine compartment seals mitred at the corners?  And if so, would it make sense to try and mitred the new aftermarket seals, or just install in four separate pieces?

Question 3: Are they installed with adhesive, or just held in place by the edge lip?

TIA.

Robert
