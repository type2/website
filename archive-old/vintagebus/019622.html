No - it goes to the end.  The seals sit on top of each other.  Also,
be generous and &quot;scrunch&quot; it a little, because it will shrink over time.
They did on my '60, and now I have a gap on each side.

I've also found that lubing the face of the seals helps tremendously
in getting the door closed the first few times.

&gt; Now for my question, does the long seal above the cargo doors on the body go 
&gt; from end to end (bout three ft.), or does it stop about a cm before the 
&gt; ends.  I looks like it would stop, because the side seals on the doors need 
&gt; to fit in there.
&gt; Sorry if this doesn't make any sense...kinda tought to explain.  I can give 
&gt; you any info you need.
