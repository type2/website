Subject: Winter Bus Camping Haiku Contest Update

Hi Volks,

I am pleased to announce the winners in the 2005 Winter Bus Camping 
Haiku Contest.

The 32 entries received were quite good, and sheer volume demanded that 
I enlist assistance from a select group of  judges to determine a 
winner both poetic and bus-relevant... The solution was to get the help 
of the spouses of 5 bus pilots attending the TCWBC. Thanks ladies!

And here are the winners:

Fifth Place: Stephen, Chillicothe OH
&gt; Driving mostly blind
&gt; Eyes straining to see through frost
&gt; Ker-bang! What was that?

(Oh man, can I ever identify with that... it reminds me of driving my 
73 westy to work through the winter of 99/00 while working the midnight 
shift)

Fourth Place: Stephen, Chillicothe OH
&gt; Gray skies meet white fields
&gt; Westies circle unbroken
&gt; Bound by fire and friends.

(That one makes me want to hit the road NOW.)

Third Place:  Stephen, Chillicothe OH
&gt; Cold winds huddle us
&gt; Maple leaf, and stars and stripes
&gt; We want to be here.

(Amen!)

Second Place: (Jerry &amp; Melissa Jess)
&gt; Frost on the windows
&gt; Ice on the antenna
&gt; Cold in the camper

( I've been told that ice on the antenna can cause a van-aerial 
disease.)


The Grand Prize Winner is Stephen,  Chilcotte OH, who sent in the 
following entry:
&gt; Cold Westies shiver
&gt; As the day's light slowly comes
&gt; Campfires and coffee.

Stephen will receive a Suburban Design Core TCWBC &quot;Hoodie&quot; sweatshirt 
for his effort. Many thanks to Adam at SDC for his generous sponsorship 
of this contest.

Thanks also must go out to everyone who took the time to compose and 
send in an entry, it did help to make the wait for the campout pass 
just a little quicker. The weather forecast for the weekend here is 
going to ensure that we'll have plenty of snow on the ground and a sure 
incentive to keep the campfire blazing well into the night. So far it 
looks like there will be about 10 buses camping and a couple more bus 
owners who will be stopping in to visit.

Tomorrow morning I'll be riding out to the airport with Adam Narraway 
in his 68 westy to pick up &quot;EveryBus Chris&quot; for the weekend, he's 
flying in to explore Toronto and enjoy the winter campout with us, then 
it's back to the airport for a flight home on Sunday. Thank goodness 
for Air Canada seat sales!

Happy trails,
