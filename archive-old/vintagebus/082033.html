Subject: RE: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

&gt; I am running a 200MM lower pulley on both of my 1967 Buses  WOW  what a
&gt; difference in cooling   that 200MM pulley really spins that fan
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From now on every motor I have will have a 200MM pulley  cheapest and
&gt; easiest way to cool your motor

how about a few question.
is 200mm a stock size? if not is there enough clearance to get the belt
around?

what upper pulley are you running?

what ratio is it upper to lower.

i have a porsche upper and I dont know which lower without measuring (the
biggest i had in the pile anyway) and it gives around 2.3-2.4 : 1 ratio.
works quite well.
