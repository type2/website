Subject: RE: Engine rebuild - What would you do?

Short answer:  Nothing.

&quot;The motor runs well, has good compression, and starts right up every time.&quot;
Good.
&quot;The three problems with it are: high idle 1800rpm(dual Kadrons) that I've
tried to mess with, but that's as low as I can get it,&quot;  So what...  Maybe a
CDI module would help.  I run Weber 34ICTs and they idle very low with a
good spark provided by the Tiger CDI.  
&quot;oil seems to be leaking everywhere, (but pressure gauge still shows 35 -
40)&quot;  No pressure problems, but depending on the leaks I would consider
tearing it down and resealing it.  Tedious process to keep all the parts
back in the right spots.
&quot;and it backfires due to rusted out exhaust (I believe).&quot;  Since you are in
Conn. get a SS unit from Bus Depot for ~$125ish.
&quot;I don't have that kind of money right&quot;  There you go, decision made :)


Take Care,
Adrian
