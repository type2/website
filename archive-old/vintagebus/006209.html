&gt; Ok, I've been talking to the local parts people and I've come to the
&gt; conclusion that most of them are idiots.  Can someone please help me. I'm
&gt; looking for a cross reference for the following paint codes into a base
coat
&gt; clear coat system:
&gt;
&gt; L380 Turquoise/L289 Blue white
&gt; L325 Mouse grey/L87 Pearl white

The OEM paint supplier for VW was Glasurit. They have all the original
formulas as supplied to VW for any year.

Contact a Glasurit (now owned wholly by BASF) &quot;automotive&quot; paint store. Auto
parts stores are not set-up to sell automotive paint. If there isn't a
Glasurit store in your area, PPG can mix most VW colors as well.
