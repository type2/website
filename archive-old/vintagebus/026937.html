Subject: 6V 105mm generator
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


 Generator 6V
 
 131 903 021 (105mm diameter) used engine H 0 000 001 through H 0 183 372, 
 superceded by
 
 111 903 021K (105mm dia)  used on H 0 000 001 through H 0 183 372
 
 both use voltage regulator 111 903 801 D
 
 ya, the V and the W or amps or whatever other rating both have to match 
 between the gen and the regulator. there are a wide range of 6V regulators, 
as the gens kept changing
 
 FWIW, three varieties of 12V 90 mm generator are listed.

  On this subject:
  
  I've been accumulating parts for the eventual conversion of my '66 back to
  6v.  I have a genuine Bosch rebuilt large diameter 6v generator (NOS in
  Bosch box!), but I'm a bit stumped as to what regulator to use.  I bought a
  NOS Bosch 6v regulator, a blisterpacked one on a bright yellow card, like
  they used to sell in Checker Auto Parts and other places.  Now that I read
  the fine print, I see that it's not the correct part for a '66 Bus.
  
  Can anyone tell me the correct part numbers (VW and Bosch numbers) for the
  regulator I need?
