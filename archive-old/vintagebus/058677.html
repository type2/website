Subject: re: vwt july

Subject: july vwt , vwoa, interview

july vwt, interveiw states&quot;it would beirresponsible for vw's current 
buiseness to devote too many resources celebrating thepast.we must 
concentrate on today's products and customers&quot; they just don't furcking get 
it, same ole song and dance from them.how they can think that a person 
thinks that wolfgang international is associated with the vw factory because 
they have a single cab with a vw emblem on it is way beyong my comprihetion. 
one thing i do know is that i have a 1961
vw single cab, 2001 nissan xterra, 2001 nissan pick up all in my garage and 
not a single water cooled vw, but i'm a customer of the past , and {i won't 
say never} but it will have to be a heck of a deal to ever buy a vw that was 
made
after 1967, paul
---------------------------
  Yes what a total fluff job that was. I dont necesarily think vw should 
pump out parts for beetles either so the premise was kinda flawed but overal 
it was a joke of an article. (btw, toyota made not 1 part for my 1969 
corona, nor did i expect them to). If anyone goes to any chevy drag races 
(guilty), how many people there are selling shirts with a picture or a chevy 
logo on them? Does this somehow devalue the mark? I just dont see it. I hate 
this topic, i hate VW for it and their fluff job of an interview on it 
really didnt answer any questions but rather made them look even more 
foolish for 'yea we know it irritates people, our lawyers are big bad guys, 
vw germany says its ok, we are doing it anyways'. They are 100% completely 
wrong on the fact that we are just old vw enthusiasts as well. If they 
looked into it Id bet they find out probably 50% of bug people have had or 
will have a new one sooner or alter. This is probably quite a higher 
percentage of 'regular' car people that will ever have a vw, nothing to 
stifle. I have had a new one, I will never again, thats a given. Anyways bad 
topic, just makes you want to set up a vw punching bag and go to town on 
them.
Bus content:
  I got my wolfgang adaper on the way and a 72 non booster MC for the 67 
deluxe hope to do it this weekend. I found a few peices I was missing at a 
local boneyard so ive got some bits to play with. Does anyone have an 
ambulance fan switch for sale? And any idea of what fans I can rig in there? 
(i have the plate). I know the later bus accesory fans can work but those 
seem almost as expensve as a ambulance setup. Has anyone taken apart 
wolfgang safaris and repainted or powdercoated them? In 2 months (1 month in 
a GARAGE!) they have already started to rust! I had this problem a few years 
ago and had REALLY hoped they had fixed this. I cant imagine them making a 
profit if everyone wants to return them (as a few friends have). Does it 
take a press or anything crazy to put them back together? Thanks
