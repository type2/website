I dont understand that, If you call the local dairy they are often willing to 
give a few of them(as in you come up during daylight and ASK for them) away 
for things such as school projects, or food drives/collection centers. How 
can they know who took them and who got them free?
    If they find mine will they really charge the $1,500 dollar fine? will 
they multiply it by 20 when they see the crates?:)
