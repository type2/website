Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet Metal for 65' bus- more questions

FWIW I have seen stove pipe (yes you read that right the galvanized metal =
stove pipe you might use on a wood stove) used very effectively (hard to =
tell the difference from original). Besides to be correct it would have =
originally been wrapped with a grey piece of insulating fabric makeing it =
hard to distinguish between the original.

Hi! New guy on the list (reactivated '67 13-window Deluxe in Phila. Pa.
area)...

I was distressed to read the negative reports on body panel quality, since =
I
just made the commitment to fix the body right. Lots of questions: Is it =
the
whole group's concensus that BFY's panels are best? What variety does The
Bus Depot sell (they're local for me, but seem more focused on later =
buses)?
Schofield in the U.K. seems to offer pieces that the others do not -- does
he sell to the U.S.? It seems only RMMW offers a heater tube in the U.S.,
but it's only 36&quot; long and very expensive -- what's the deal? (I need the
whole straight tube, plus the angled piece just ahead of it that comes =
down
from over the front beam.)

Finally, is anyone on the list from the Philadelphia area? Know of any =
shops
in the area that have done bus body restoration work?

Thanks in advance!

-- Rich
