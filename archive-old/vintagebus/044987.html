&lt;&lt; I saw that 
 there is a code for a 1 ton bus. (M215) I was wondering what is done 
 different to make it handle the extra load. &gt;&gt;
Hi Brian,
Uses the bigger 1964-67 brake shoes. But still has the pre-1964 smaller link 
pins and 63 only smaller diameter splined rear lower axle shafts with the 
later post-1963 gearing that are longer than the earlier ones.  To accomplish 
this VW made one year only rear brake drums with the smaller longer splined 
hole, and king pins made for the 1964-67 front brake backing plates and wheel 
cylinders and at the same time the smaller diameter pre-1964 link pins.
