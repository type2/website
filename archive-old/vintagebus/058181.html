&gt; To add my 2 cents to the convo I recall calling WW many years back regarding 
&gt; shoulder belts and they didn't carry them as the thought was that the 
&gt; pillar couldn't support the force in the event of a crash. Food for 
&gt; thought.

Hi Michael,
Sounds like a cop out to us!  The 1967 thru 79 buses had the shoulder points 
and there is not that much differance between them in this particular body 
area.  More than likely they just do not carry them due to the proliferance 
of dead 1968 on thru vanagon buses which have shoulder belts availible 
inexpensively out of wrecking yards.   Eric&amp;Barb
