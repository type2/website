I have been on this list for over 7 months, but have not written in as of
yet. My question is this; does anybody have any suggestions of where to buy
interior panels for a 1967 walkthrough bus? I have been restoring this for
eight months,  I just got done painting it, and now it's time to put it all
back together.I have found prices to vary greatly. Has anybody purchased
TMI panels or Westcoast classic restoration? Any input would be
appreciated.  Jim
