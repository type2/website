From: &lt;lisaandtodd_at_att_dot_net&gt;
&gt;   You don't have to have OG plates or paperwork to get
&gt; YOM plates. Witness my '59 double cab with black on
&gt; yellow plates purchased at a Pomona swap.
&gt;   What you do need is LOTS of Excedrin Migrane,
&gt; tenacity, and patients. Mine took about 6 months and 4
&gt; trips to the local DMV.


 Todd,
Your plates are black letters on plates. These are the last series of plates
you can use as YOM plates.
These ended in 62.
Starting in 63, the plates were black with yellow letters. And the order
reversed. Yellow w/black letters were number/letter, i.e. 123 ABC. Black
w/yellow letters were letter/number, i.e. ABC 123.
You cannot use a black w/yellow plate on a 63 and up unless you can prove they
are the correct original plates from when the vehicle was 1st registered.

&gt; This rabble may be of some help to Cali listees.
&gt;
&gt; When I bought my 63EZ in Ariaona, I received the og Cali
&gt; black plates with the
&gt; bus.  Checked out the CA DMV website and see that the
&gt; cut-off year for YOM
&gt; plates is 1962.  Damnit!
