Subject: Re: [VB] leaking trans fluid - any ideas

was low so we added 1 qt of oil and continued to check it.&gt;&gt;

Hi P&amp;C,
Change to plain old 30Wt., we tried 20/50Wt. Castrol and it acted more like 
40/50Wt. in our DR engines.  Oddly in the SR engines it seems to not get as 
high of oil pressure due to the smaller oil passages.  Definitely check your 
oil level more often.  You really want to find the low oil level before you 
get near the fill mark!
 
&lt;&lt; On the asphalt the oil looked reddish and smelled like tranny fluid.  &gt;&gt;

When ever there is a large oil puddle a smell test for tranny (sulfur odor) 
or engine oil (No sulfur odor.) is a good thing to do!
 
&lt;&lt;This leakage appears to come from the transmission side covers and/or front 
shifter input shaft. &gt;&gt;

Remove engine and inspect for large puddling of tranny oil in bellhousing, 
oil soaked clutch disc, FW gland bolt needle bearing condition (You did 
grease these lightly last and each time you reinstall engine?).  If any of 
these are bad looking replace inputshaft tranny seal and possibly polish the 
bore the seal seats into to prevent seepage around the seal.  If it does not 
look like the problem is in the bellhousing inspect the axle boots and check 
torque of tranny side plates which should be a breeze with the engine out.
 
&lt;&lt; Has anyone drilled a small 1/4 in hole in the bell housing to see where 
the leak comes from?  Tapped and plugged?  Can it be done with everything in 
place? &gt;&gt;

VW did have a tech bullitian about drilling a small hole in the bellhousing 
to allow oiling of the throw out bearing without removing the engine.  You 
would need to drill a 1/2&quot; hole (Threaded to install a plug to not allow bits 
of rock from getting in there!) to get enough of to get an eye full to see 
anything and you would have to have a piece of fiber optic to get the light 
in there at aimed around.
