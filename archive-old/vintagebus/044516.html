I have just a few side tents left at the list member discount.  This includes
the Tramp tent which has been discontinued and I won't likely be able to get
anymore once my stock is gone.  List member price is $410 while they last.  I
also have 3 of the Nizza tents left at $430.

I can also get 3 more Casa Royal tents, and hopefully ship before Christmas.
I need to place my order on these early next week, so P-mail me for details
asap if interested.  The Casa Royal is the largest and most cool side tent
I've ever seen.  This is the same tent I had setup at BBTA.  (info on the
tents can be found on my web pages, see below)

I still have a few Reimo Accessory catalogs left for sale.  Reimo is a German
company similar to Westfalia that converts vans into campers, or sells kits
and accessories.

The catalogs are 318 pages of parts kits and accessories with some specific
stuff for VW T2 and T4 (Vanagon and Eurovan)  There are lots of great color
photographs, but the text is all in German.

I sell these on my web site for $10 including shipping, but will sell these to
any listmember for $7 (US addresses) or $10 (Canadian addresses)

Anyone who wants to order anything from the Reimo catalog, I need to get your
order by next Tuesday.

Thanks,
