Subject: WTB: Locking gas door for a 66
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm looking for a locking gas door for a 66 bus.  I
have one in good condition, just can't the the broken
locking mechanism off.  I'd be wiling to trade it
straight up for one that is also in good condition
with no lock.  If no one has a door, any suggestions
for how to get the old lock off?  The screw that holds
the little metal &quot;bent finger&quot; that extends to do the
actual locking is rusted to the cylinder.  That is
preventing me from removing the large nut that
tightens the cylinder to the flap.  I don't want to
cut that piece because I'd like to use it for the
other lock.  I found a replacement lock (with an
actual key) that fits in the hole perfectly, so no
mods to the flap - wooohooo!  

Thanks,
Paul
66 Crew - with a stuck lock on my gas door
