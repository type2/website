Subject: Re: [VB] 2/3 front seat question

On my 66 and 67, only gravity holds the seat down in the back. The front edge
has 2 square U's that fit into the spring clips.


&gt; I am installing a 2/3 passenger seat in my 66 bus.  When I bought the bus
&gt; the seat was in it but just kind of laying there.  I see there are two pins
&gt; that hold the front of the seat but what holds the seat bottom down.  There
&gt; is a small hole below the frame on the right side and a short platform on
&gt; the left side.  Is there a special clasp to secure the seat?  Anyone know
&gt; where I could find a diagram of the seat hardware or where I could find the
&gt; fittings?  This is my first split so I don't know what to compare it
&gt; against.
&gt; You have all been a great help with my project.
