Subject: Re: [VB] poor gas mileage

I'm pretty sure (fingers crossed) that this may be a big part of my
problem. Since getting the new engine, I've been very cautious about
lugging it. Although I haven't been gunning it,  I have been over revving a
bit to err on the side of over rev's rather than under revs. I've got to
hook up the tach and get to the bottom of this especially if a little bit
of free precision can save me a lot of gas money.
Thanks to everyone for your advice. I'll let you know the results asap.

&gt; I was concerned about my mileage in my 60 a few years ago.  Eric and Barb
&gt; posted a message like the above back then.  So ... I just started to drive
&gt; more carefully - not accelerating from stop signs etc.  I thought about
&gt; keeping the rpms down but I did not use a tach.  My mileage went from
about
&gt; 18 mpg imp to between 29 and 31 mpg imp.  Sometimes I was even getting
like
&gt; 33 mpg imp.  I've got a big bore 40 hp engine with a 28 pict carb.
