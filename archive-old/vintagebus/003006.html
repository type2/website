&gt;Would any kind soul have connection information for the main harness that
goes
&gt;from the cab to engine compartment on my '67 Split?

You betcha!  Go to Thom Fitzpatricks's page
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring.html and there you'll find a nice batch of
color wiring diagrams.  I downloaded one, printed it out, and had it
laminated.  It's 2 pages wide and 3 pages tall - everything is just
great...except I think I printed out one for the wrong year.  At any rate,
it's worth downing!
