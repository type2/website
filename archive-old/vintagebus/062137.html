Subject: Re: [VB] URGENT: NW Vintage Show dirrections

the burger meet is at the University Village Burgermaster.  I guess 90 to 
I-5, north on I- 5, take the university exit- #165 and from there it's 
confusing, so if you see a rusty bd and a shiny green/white 65 wandering 
around tell me too.    The Burgermaster should be in the phone book.

the show Sat is at Shoreline community college, take exit 175 and go up to 
aurora (aka rte 99) follow the signs.  There'll be signs from the freeway 
exit to the college.

&lt;&lt; I kinda decided at the last moment to go over to the Vintage Meet friday
 afternoon.  If someone could be so kind as to give me some good
 dirrectiions to Shoreline Comm. College coming from Pullman (or Vantage)
 that would be very, very helpful.  Thanks in advance and I hope to see
 some of you over there.  I'll be the one riding around on the '66
 Coppertone Schwinn stik-shift Fastback.
