&gt;  After the requisite archive search, I'm still in need of your 
&gt;  assistance. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I building a * temporary * single port 1600 out of spare parts.
&gt;  The short block is a used bug motor. I don't know the history before I 
&gt;  ran it, but it had good power. when I got a better motor,
&gt;  I pulled it and it was put in spare parts rotation. I pulled the heads 
&gt;  off it and put them on another motor for a friend's westy. 
&gt;  After that it sat, covered, in storage for 4 years.
&gt;   
&gt;  Now I've put some other used heads on it and am going to resurrect it.
&gt;  (I assume these heads are good because they would hold liquid in the 
&gt;  combustion chamber with out leaking past the valves previous to
&gt;  installation) 

so did you do the measuremnet of the ps/cs like it says in Muir's book?    
put the ring in the cylinder and measure the gap.?  

did you CLEAN OUT THE RING GROOVES?  if they have lots of crud in there, it 
may make it hard to the rings to move freely.

how many miles/hours on this motor?  usually you just let it run at 2K rpms 
for a bit.  

If you can't get it to run right, double check you tune up stuff.  Point, 
timing etc plug wires on right?
