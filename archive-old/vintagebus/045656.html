Subject: Putting on the VW Bus Emblem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi, All. I just got the Rocky Mountain MotorWorks Emblem that I posted 
earlier about. I am satisfied with the quality, but will keep searching for a 
good original as well. Anyway, putting it on was the biggest pain in the 
butt! Had to take out the front panels as well as the tray entirely to even 
attempt to get at the top hole. Even then I had to tie a thread to the emblem 
bolt and thread the nut down to help get it near the hole. To make a long 
story short, got it on and hopefully as tight as can be. Anyone else have the 
miserable experience? Thanks for listening and take care.
