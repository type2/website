I believe the ORANGE/WHITE euro. spec tent is a little bit tougher to find.
But I guess it could just be a faded red/white one?

&gt;I paid $1000 for my tent, whichI felt was on the steep side, but
&gt;sometime I have more dollars than cents when it comes to bus stuff...

Too true! I know that feeling well. :)

I agree that $1700 is WAAY too much for that tent. I think I got my Westy
tent for $350 that was with everything (ok, except the floor, Joe ;) ).
It's the good old yellow &amp; gray tent for my 55. That was at Pomona about 3
years ago. Not a bad price!
