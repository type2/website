Subject: Re: [VB] Brake Pedal problem.

Yep,
the spring seat is missing. If you want it done right......
From the parts page, as small as the picture is, it looks like a filler 
piece that keeps the spring on center around the pedal axle. Anyone know if 
that is correct?

Looks like the problem is that the spring is doubling up on itself and there 
is too much friction.  I installed a washer about .1&quot; thick to space out the 
pedal from the frame and give the spring more room. Helps, but is still not 
right. The pedal is sluggish on the return.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Chris
