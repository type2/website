This was the year. My wife and I were listening to the rumors of one last Bad Camberg show. We are going! My wife cannot believe it takes a VW show to get me to Europe but what ever reason she will go. Vacation is bid for all settled. But wait she ends up in ground school during those dates. OK, no Bad Camberg. 



I have a friend in our club from the LA area. I can get good prices on plane tickets he can set us up with places to stay. Right On! OCTO, SOTO, Classic, Toy Show, you name it we are doing it. But wait, (I am starting to hate that phrase) she has a check ride that weekend. OK, no Classic, OCTO etc....



Being from the NW area at least I have the Vintage meet in Seattle, my personal favorite of the year. But wait...a close friend of ours is getting married that day. So how late is fashionably late to a wedding?



I hope the rest of you are enjoying your shows and please keep sending updates, it seems this year it is the only way I am going to experience any of them.



Thanks for letting me rant,

Craig 

the Gorge VW club
