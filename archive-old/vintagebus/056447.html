Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

You are right on the formula.  Basic FAP &amp; VAL.  Accordingly, the increased
volume in the larger bore would push more juice down the line, actuating the
brakes earlier, for the same amount of pedal travel.  Wonder if this is why
all the bigger better brake systems have bigger bore sizes then?  I'm
guessing Porsche didn't go bigger to make the brake system on the 6 cylinder
worse than the one on the 4 cylinder.

&gt; &gt; With all this talk of upgrading to a dual circuit MC it got me thinking
&gt; about a couple things.  Back in my 914 days the hot upgrade was to go
&gt; from the 914 MC to an early 911 MC.  Identical except the bore of the 911
&gt; MC was larger.  I think it was a change from 17mm to 19mm, 19mm to 21mm,
&gt; or something like that.  Does anyone know what the bore size is on the
&gt; single vs. dual MC's?  If the bore size is smaller (I doubt it) it may
&gt; not be the &quot;upgrade&quot; it is touted to be.  Has anyone tried the 914 or
&gt; early 911 MC in a bus?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; On master cylinders, changing to a larger bore size would increase the
&gt; force needed to achieve any given level of braking.  Pressure equals fore
&gt; divided by area, so if you increase the bore size (and piston area) you
&gt; will reduce the system pressure for a given force.
&gt;
&gt; I think that switching to a dual circuit master cylinder is a great idea,
&gt; and you don't have to go all that far from stock to achieve it.  All the
&gt; lines are there.  You just have to be careful to select a master cylinder
&gt; that is compatible with drum front brakes if that is what you have.
