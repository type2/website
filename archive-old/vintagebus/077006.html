Austin
 
let me start by saying... if you're one of the 4 people who've requested to be dropped from the mailing list in the last few months, i'll be updating the mailing list right after the show so you'll have to suffer through this last email - here it goes...
 
 
 
this is a reminder that this sunday the 16th is our big event, the 3rd annual  Novemberfest FREE Car Show/Swap Meet, hosted by the Austin Air Coolers VW Gang. we're expecting a great turnout this year so you won't want to miss it.  here are some details...
 
1. FREE - it costs nothing to enter your VW.
 
2. exciting categories - we try our best to give everyone a shot at winning a car show category so there's no reason to leave your VW at home.
 
3. public judging - you be the judge! our car show is judged entirely by our peers and the general public.
 
4. prizes - no trophies at this show, we'll have a table full of good prizes to choose from if you win a category. you win, you pick what you want.
 
5. raffle - we'll be selling raffle tickets for $10 that will give you a chance at winning not 1, not 2, but 3 raffle prizes. we'll start off by raffling off a set of stock chrome rims with caps, then move on to a pair of custom seats with rails from sewfine, and end with our main raffle prize - a custom built 1600 dp longblock!  we've got over $2200 worth of prizes to give away! plus, if you buy 2 raffle tickets, you get a FREE event t-shirt!
 
6. t-shirts - take home one of our &quot;super&quot;-cool event shirts. like last year, these shirts were custom designed for us by a fellow Air Cooler. $10 will have you looking &quot;super.&quot;
 
7. framed prints - we've got a limited number (5) of official prints for sale that are framed, matted, numbered and signed by the artist. a great picture to hang on your wall.
 
8. swap meet - do you have VW stuff you wanna sell? bring it b/c our swap meet is FREE and we expect a healthy number of swappers to show up.
 
9. food - this show is catered so you don't have to worry about bringing food. we'll have a variety of food to satisfy the carnivores, omnivores and herbivores out there. there will also be soft drinks, juices and waters. i believe the price for food is $2 for a single serving and $5 for a plate of food including beans and rice.
 
10. music - we'll have live music playing throughout the day starting at 10am with the Convict Hillbillies, then moving on to an all-star blues jam session and finishing with Chad Thomas and the Crazy Kings.
 
11. fermented beverages - the local real ale brewing company will be providing us with some beverages.
 
12. Location - Novemberfest will be at the same location as last year, Motormania (a local VW shop with lots of parking space). 10208 Ranch Road 620 N, Austin, TX 78726 - or call if you're lost (512) 331-0877 - or just click here for a map you can use to figure out how to get there and print out the directions.
 
13. Schedule - registration will be from 10-12am, followed by public judging from 12-3 and raffle/prizes at 4. you can show up early but you better have some doughnuts or something to feed us.
 
14. RAIN OR SHINE - this event is taking place no matter what the forecast. if it so happens that it begins to drizzle or even rain, we'll have complimentary panchos and we'll GIVE THE BEER AWAY FOR FREE! that's right - RAIN=FREE BEER!
 
let's recap... we've got 3 nice raffle prizes (worth over $2,300) that you can win with the purchase of just one raffle ticket for $10 - if you decide to buy 2 raffle tickets you get a FREE shirt - you can eat and drink all day for next to nothing - live music (it'll be covered so there's no chance of cancelling the tunes) - NO entry fee on the car show or the swap meet - a table full of prizes - and FREE PANCHOS AND FREE BEER IF IT EVEN SO MUCH AS DRIZZLES!
