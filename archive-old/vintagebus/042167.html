I have two new Mexican engines and I'm happy with both.  About 10,000 on
one and 5000 on the other.  I think that a rebuild of equal quality would
be just about as costly as the new engine.

The bad is that you get them exactly how the VW factory builds them.  They
can handle the worst gasoline, but the low compression will cut your power
a bit.  IMO, this is a good tradeoff.

&gt; a few hundred dollars more? i just assumed the new ones were the better 
&gt; option? any advice? experiences?
