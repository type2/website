Subject: [VB] loose Flywheel?  [WAS: A New *dunk* sound]
References: &lt;200012221546.HAA97484_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

You'd be amazed how far an engine will go with a loose flywheel.  About
10 years ago -- and right around the holidays -- I was on a trip from FL
to NC in a 68 Westy and about 200 miles into the trip I started hearing
funky noises that changed with clutch action but didn't seem to be like
normal bad-clutch sounds.  This was about 1AM outside Macon, GA.

Drove another 200 miles before it just started sounding terrible; pulled
into a truck stop in Commerce GA and slept a few hours, then got up and
pulled the engine.  Nothing seemed wrong with the clutch.  Puzzled,
putting the engine back in, trying to get it lined up I happened to push
on the flywheel and saw it was loose!  Somehow the gland nut had come
loose; I snugged it back as best as I could and drove on.

Made it another 5-600 miles on that trip before it loosened up again
(bus was having hot-start problems and I roll-started it; popping the
clutch seemed to loosen it that time).  Parked in front of a highway
patrol station and did the R&amp;R again in under an hour (fun with a hot
engine).

Made it another 200 miles home from there and it happened again around
town a week or so later.  Pulled the engine and took a close look - the
crank dowel holes were ovaled.  Borrowed a jig from a local VW mechanic
and drilled 4 new holes, slapped it together, and never had another
problem in that department for the next few years I owned the bus.

Never could determine if collateral damage was caused by that.  The
bus's next owner, my brother-in-law, blew it up within 2 years by (IMO)
pushing it a little too hard on the interstate -- could be that the
loose flywheel incident prematurely wore the crank bearings....

&gt; After close inspection the engine appeared unharmed  -  even the threads in
&gt; the crank and endplay were OK.  They reinstalled the flywheel with a new
&gt; glandnut and we got another 25,000+ miles out of that engine.

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; loose flywheel? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;That would be a possibility, but the engine would run (If it would run at
&gt; &gt;all!) for only minutes before destroying itself.
