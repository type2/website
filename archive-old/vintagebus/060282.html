Late on this topic.... but the best one I heard was somebody with newly rebuilt engine in their Beetle in Edmonton Alberta took it to a local repair shop to tune it up. 

Got it back home and still running badly.... Owner checked it and you guessed it...... the serial numbers had mysteriously changed. Shop charged and went out of business...
