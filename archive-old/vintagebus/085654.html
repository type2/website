Subject: [VB] VW trademark ? 

Hi All


Does anyone know if there is any problem (legal or moral), registering a 
Domain name with the letters VW in it?

If the site is a fan site would VW be concerned?

There used to be a site www.vwbus_dot_com that was a fan site back in 2000-2002 
check
http://web.archive_dot_org/web/*/http://www.vwbus_dot_com for archived pages of the 
site.

and now it points to

http://www.volkswagen_dot_de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3.html

is VW buying up domains as they expire?


many thanks
peter
