Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Cargo Door Awning?

Gee whiz. I just saw them on display by the vendor at the Lakeport show last
month, but I don't know what I did with my vendor literature. Maybe if you
visit vwlakecounty_dot_com someone on one of the links will remember the vendor.
Actually the email at the bottom of the 2006 show info for Will would be
good as he was the organizer this year and he would know who the vendor was.

I am looking for the small awning that goes over the two cargo doors when
they are opened. They were for sale some years ago and were made in
California.  Are there any out there for sale?, hopefully, uj
