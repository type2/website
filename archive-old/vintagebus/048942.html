Nothing on the seats, but there is a guy named Chris up in Central California who supposedly makes awesome replacement wheelwell panels.  I've spoken with him on the phone about parts in general, seems to be a really nice, honest person.  A guy I sold a Double Cab rear seat box and seat to bought a pair from Chris and had nothing but great things to say about his work.  

Phone number is (805)438-5130.  Evidently you can only phone him between 6:00 pm PST and 9:00 pm PST.  Don't ask me why, but I know it's true, cuz the phone didn't even work when I first tried calling one afternoon.

Hope it helps.

Robert
