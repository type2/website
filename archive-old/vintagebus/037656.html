Subject: New owner

Here's me welcoming me to the list.  Just acquired my first VW Bus, a 1962, and
I couldn't be happier.  However, I've been having a hard time I.D'ing the
engine: AH 128907.  I suspect it's a type I, but don't want to venture more than
that?  Any help out there?
  
(Hopefully this first note is not in violation of the rather intimidating bit of
legal code I received upon subscription...I'm sure I'll know shortly!)

Duncan MacLeod....new to the VW family
