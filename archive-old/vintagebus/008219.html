&gt; Over the past couple weeks, we've endured 90 to 100F temps with 60%
humidity
&gt; more or less.  The air is so heavy you can hardly breathe.  Well I've had
&gt; this idea of sewing acquarium tubing into some clothes and hooking it up
to
&gt; the garden hose to keep cool.  Sounds zany but it just might work.
&gt;
&gt; So I went to walmart - bought the hose and fittings I needed.  I sewed the
&gt; tubing into my cap and then wrapped my torso in the line.  I hooked up and
&gt; within about 15 seconds I was outside and not sweating!  Damn.  So started
&gt; working on the swingaxle boots on my bus.  All was well until my poor
splice
&gt; gave way and soaked my overalls.  I figured I'd finish my work so there I
&gt; lay under the bus, water bubbling forth from my overalls looking like I'm
&gt; taking a major piss.  As funny as it all sounds - I couldn't believe how
&gt; awesome this was - working in the heat and not sweating.  The tether was
&gt; only mildy annoying compared to the heat.
&gt;
&gt; I think this is an idea I'm gonna work on some more in the future...
