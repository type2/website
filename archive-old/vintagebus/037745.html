                      buses behind a barn                          5/23/99
Found a few VW's behind a barn a few days ago that I want to get some feed back on.  First one is a 65ish with windows all the way around, no little ones on top and no sun roof.  I think it was a walk through.  Had lots of engine parts, rust city, on the inside but the sides were fairly straight with somewhat intact interior and had all the seats and things like that.  Second one was a camper, no pop up, but had crank out windows,again with lots of crap inside. (why do they do that).  It did however have the tent, slightly lived in by mice, and what looked like to be lots of polls, I assume for the tent.  Third was a single cab that had the tool box area amputated and was lowered.  It had some rust but wasn't all that bad.  There was also a station wagon that was in about the same condition.  Question is:  What is it worth?  A few of the parts I could use on my 59 single cab but, not that many.  Is a guy better off striping something like that and trying to make his money back!
 selling latches and handles at a swap meet, or are there people  out there looking for builders?  Any feed back is appreciated.....
