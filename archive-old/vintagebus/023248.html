My '54 has 'em.

Clara, does your '53?

Jerry, why don't you go rip out the headliner on your '51 and tell us if it

&gt;I didn't know about these wires until it was mentioned here on the list.
&gt;Looking at the Bentley, and the diagrams on Thom's site, it does show 
&gt;these two wires as stock on the '63-'65 USA and Euro wiring diagram,
&gt;and as a &quot;service installation&quot; after that.  Does anyone know how far 
&gt;back these started?  Just curious.
