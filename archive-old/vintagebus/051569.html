Subject: Re: [VB] Bumpers Again

I will have to disagree. 66-67 bumpers are unique to
those specific years. I will stand by my post.

&gt; I did not see anyone correcting you on this
&gt; but.......65 had pointy fronts and
&gt; slash rears. The opposite of what you said. Up to
&gt; the end of 64, both front and
&gt; rear were slash. 66/67 were both pointy.

&gt; &gt; 1965 (late) Busses had a slash front and a pionted
&gt; &gt; rear bumper. The story is that VW ran out of the
&gt; rears
&gt; &gt; and had to use the pointed rears that were slated
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; the 66 model year bus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For reference, my 65 has a pointed-end front
&gt; bumper
&gt; &gt; &gt; with deluxe trim. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not have over-riders which I always thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; that was weird until I
&gt; &gt; &gt; saw a European (French) brochure for the 65
&gt; Deluxe
&gt; &gt; &gt; and no over-riders
&gt; &gt; &gt; were present.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mine did not come with a back bumper when my
&gt; family
&gt; &gt; &gt; bought it in 79 -
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, I'd have to assume that the back was slash.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Steffan,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you want it correct, then yes.  1965 was
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; year the bus had one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; style.  Probably the stampings for the other
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; &gt; not been completed!
