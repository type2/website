Subject: RE: [VB] preserving the gold

  Joe Ruiz aka Mr Okrsasa knows someone that does the process to replate?
the cases gold. I looked for his underground web site and couldn't find it.
So if you do loose the gold he can have it redone. A friend of mine is
sending Joe his 25 hp case to be done.

ronnie

I know David &quot;got the right screw&quot; knows where his site is

mostly likely cadmium... if it goes away, eastwood and others sell 
spray cans of the stuff to replace it.
