Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] H2O injection

What I understand from the report is that it increases your gas mileage and it decreases your cyl head temperature.

&gt; I guess I don't understand the point of the H2O injection. I can see it 
&gt; being used in a hi compression engine to reduce ping. What else is it good 
&gt; for?
