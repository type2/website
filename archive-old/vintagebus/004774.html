   I just jumped a forklift today. When I hooked the cables up, big sparks
and smoke. What happened  was I had a cheap a** pair of Wal-Mart special
$6.00 jumper cables. The positive and negative clamps touched each other on
the handles. Yes, there was plastic over the handles but it was very thin
and just melted it.
   Lesson learned. I have a heavy duty set in my garage but the cheap ones
fit under the seat. You get what you pay for I guess.
