Hi, 

A while back somebody posted that they were missing, and wanted 
to find, the screw on ring that holds the squeeze pump to the 
windshield washer bottle on the pre-'68 Bus.  If you are still out there 
and still need it, a friend has one and wants $11 including mailing to 
you.  Contact me, not the list, and I'll go get it and send it along.
