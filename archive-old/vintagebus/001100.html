Hey, why not?  Everything is original and only bolted on.  I have my
original front spindles and everything.  In the future, I can raise it back
up again and do the stock thing.  Plus, the theme for the dc is really an
early to mid 60's hot rod truck... not a piano delivery vehicle or manure
hauler.  It really all started when I decided to do the Okrasa and I found
the original petri banjo wheel.

During disassembly, I noticed that my dc was fairly intact so it's easy now
to fix the small things back to original and not later..... it's also the
fun of the search.  Setting the requirement for finding original brake line
clips and bolts (I'm missing one clip) is purely for pleasure and pain ;-)
I know a few people out there in the world that will pull *correct* bolts
for me, great people and someday I'll buy them several beers!     Also
realize that I would much rather *restore* a part than replace it and if I
have to replace it, why not find an old original one and restore it?

But then again, since I'm chroming all the bolts and nuts in the
undercarriage (it's fun to see all those bolt names DORN, Kamax, Rasche,
Verbus, etc. all polished up!), it'll be a bit more different to put the bus
back for the totally original VN crowd... oh well e la vita!

Steve wrote&gt; Original everything....and then lower it??   Uh....OK.

to my comment:
&gt; Somewhere I went astray with the original thing and decided that nothing
but
&gt; original bolts will go back in... original everything else too but rubber
&gt; parts (unless someone wants to sell me nice og pieces).  A NOS 40hp block
&gt; Ruiz Okrasa will power the thing when done.  Lowered using a WW kit and
the
&gt; wheels it will roll on are in question
