&gt;Anyway, I was wondering what that means - &quot;Big Bore 40hp&quot;.  40hp engine
&gt;bored out to a 1500 or something?
&gt;
&gt;Let me know, maybe I'll build a 1600 disguised as a bastard engine or 
something.

I had a big bore 40 in my '65 Bug (the Forty Horse Racer).  It's a standard 
40hp set up with oversized jugs (83mm) which are currently cheaper to get 
than stock.  So most 40s that get rebuilt these days are big bores.  All 
that it comes out to is 1380cc.  :)  Cruises nicely at 65-70 all day.
