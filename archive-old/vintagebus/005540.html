Subject: 67 westy stuff

Hi all, I have a question about my 67 westy rear hatch. Does anybody know
what that slide latch is, on the inside right hand side of the rear hatch?
It slides into a metal plate on the birch panel aft of the rear right hand
cabinet. Maybe this is a dumb question, I've looked at all my referance
stuff and can't find a thing on it, Bueler, Bueler, anybody. Thanks, Frozen
but still driving 67 splittie  buscicle daily in Kansas. Had a quarter inch
of ice on bus yesterday and she started right up and drove great, gotta love
it. Anybody sell industrial strength ice scrapers though?
Rock.
