You can turn the cable,,,,
Hold the cable on the crimped steel end, just forward of the threads, with
Nebraska made Peterson's Vice Grips,, not those cheap offshore ones,,,
and hold the nut still,, turn the cable as much as you can,,, but not more
than 1 turn,, then turn the cable and the nut back to original position,,
start over..
either way,, it isn't a fun job when you have to adjust it along way,,,,
my 2 cents,.
