Subject: roof insulation..
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0009051155410.70990-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hello all,

I have been searching for an inexpensive way to insulate the roof of my
standard...

The best one i have found so far is to use the foam pads that go under
carpet... it is 7/8 thick and very cheap... ($30 or so for a 6x14 foot
piece..)

I know this may not be ideal, but i just dont have the $$ to blow on that
mylar stuff from JC whitney, or the $300 or so needed to do my roof with
neoprene... &amp; fiberglass wont do as im not planning on putting a headliner
in any time soon... i would use the bulley hewitt method, but since my
insulation will be my headliner for the forseeable future, i dont want all
that duct tape and fiberglass up there looking crappy.

Unfortunately, it is maroon (blechh) i found grey, but it is thinner, i
may double it up...

Anyone have any input on this idea?

Will the 3m spray adhesive hold this stuff? the roof gets very very hot
and i am worried the heat will melt the glue.

thanks,

Steve
