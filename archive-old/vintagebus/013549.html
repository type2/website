hey all,
i found this guys website a while ago and book marked it cuz there was a lot 
on nice stuff on there. every time i took a look there were more 
outrageously priced vws there. havn't been there in a while until this. that 
bus is a J O K E ! Todd's bus is 100 times nicer and more original than 
that, i've ridden in it. throw in one of classic vws paint jobs and Todd's 
bus could sell for $75,000 in relevance.

and what is his problem with the word &quot;original&quot;? look as this 
description...
snip:
'1963 VW Bug &quot;All original&quot;!! 90,000 original miles. original reclining 
passenger seat. Original seats, panels, headliner, carpets, etc. Never 
crashed or rusted!! Inner fenders are still original paint.'

what the fuck! this crap makes me so mad, who is buying these things?
sorry,
gotta go take my medication......
