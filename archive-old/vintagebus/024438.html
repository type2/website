Subject: Cool Bus Story and Picture (long)

Hi Gang here is a great find for ya on a slow Sunday night..

Found a `58 Single cab out in the country about 2 years ago. It was
really rusty....and freshly painted in house paint.  Nothing much of
value left on the thing.  Basically looked like it would break in two if
you tried to move it.

Well, today I went for a bit of a Sunday drive today and ended up at the
`58 single cab again.  I saw an elderly black gentlemen walking towards
the house near the bus.  I had slowed to take a look at the bus...as I
did  he gave me a very friendly wave and started to walk towards us.  I
parked my `57 bug I was driving and went to greet the gentlemen.  He
introduced himself as James Johnson.  He then commented on my bug and
how much he liked it.  After a brief once over of my bug, we turned our
attentions to the `58 SC bus.

I told Mr. Johnson I had noticed his bus before and how I noticed it had
now sported a 'new' and different fresh 'house paint' job.  It was quite
colorful I might ad!!  He exclaimed how he had recently finished
painting the bus, and at his age 80++ that was a feat it was quite proud
of.

I asked Mr. Johnson how long he owned the van, and when was the last
time it ran? He then told me that the bus was his but he never has
really driven it much.  He said he had just parked it where it sits way
back in the late `60's, and that he has never driven it since.  

He said the he had a 'twin' brother who he was very, very close to. 
This bus originally belonged to him.  Seems his brother bought this `58
SC &quot;new&quot; at the local VW dealership, 'Rubini Motors' which had only just
opened for business 3 years earlier.  He said this was the one and only
new car his brother had ever owned....he said &quot;my brother loved that
little truck more then anything,... and always took A-1 good care of
that little blue VW.&quot;

Well the story turns a bit sad, as he explains how in `68 his brother
passed away from a sudden and unexpected illness.  He said losing his
twin brother, who was also his best friend, was quite a shock to him and
his family.  It took him quite some time before he could get over his
twin brothers passing.  Not long after his brothers death, his brother's
wife had mentioned how she could not drive that old VW,... and that she
did not really feel like having it around anymore.  Mr. Johnson went on
to say, &quot;I did not have the heart to see that VW sold, as every time I
looked at that old VW, I could still see my brother driving up the
road.&quot;  He said he then decided to trade his sister in-law a decent old
ford for the old bus.  She was elated, and he was quite happy too.  Mr
Johnson said he drove the old VW home.  Parked it where it sits today
and never started the bus up again.  

Every day he would look out his window at the bus and it would always
remind him of his brother. He would wash the bus periodically for the
first few years until the paint eventually started to
deteriorate....then faced with this dilemma he decided to paint it
himself were it sat with some old house paint he had...he did the entire
thing right down to the flat tires!!!  &quot;Now,&quot; he exclaims &quot;..every Fall,
near the anniversary of my brothers passing, I give the old bus a new
coat of paint to keep her looking good as my brother would have.&quot;  

I took a closer look at the bus and there seems to be close to a half
inch thick of paint on this thing!!! 

Mr. Johnson is seriously into his 80's now, yet still gets out to paint
his brothers bus once a year.  He said he has had people inquire to buy
it, but would never sell the old bus because it is all he has left of
his brother. I asked him if I could return to take a picture of the bus
to show to some friends and tell its story...A light went on in his eyes
and a smile grew on his face...... I could see he was very, very
proud.   

I only wish I could not have documented the different paint schemes mr.
Johnson had applied to this bus over the past 30 years!... from now on I
will be back to take pictures of Mr. Johnson's yearly repaint...and may
even lend a hand.
