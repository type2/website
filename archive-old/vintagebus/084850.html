&gt; OK, with all this discussion about emergency flashers, I have to ask
&gt; where would the unit have been located on a '63 panel?

The switch is to the right of the headlight switch.  The relay is
attached to that rail under the front (FRONT) edge of the parcel tray,
about halfway between the heater pipe and the right headlight bucket.

&gt; What about the nickel sized light to the left of the speedometer that
&gt; has a silver bezel ring? Is this tied into the flashers somehow?

Yes.  When you turn on the hazard flashers, this light flashes in phase
with the exterior lamps.  It shouldn't flash with the turn signals.  It
is in parallel with the coil of the hazard relay.  On my '64, there is
a long white or light grey wire running from the hazard relay to this
light.  It looks like it grounds through its mounting.

http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2247.JPG shows my '64.  You can see
the hazard light switch to the right of the headlight switch, and the
light between the speedometer and the fuel gauge.

&gt;
&gt; the wiring diagram for them is the the 63-67 Bentley, but look in the
&gt; accessories section of the electrical chapter for the 63-65 e-flasher
&gt; wiring, it is not in the regular wiring diagram.

The hazard light wiring for the '63, '64, and '65 Buses is shown in the
regular diagram - page E-1 9, &quot;Type 2 USA Version (from August 1962)
Chassis No. 971 550&quot;.  The only thing this diagram lacks is the
connection for the big red light mentioned above.  In 1966 the dreaded
&quot;9 prong box&quot; started - this is on the main diagram for '66 and '67
US-spec Buses (pages E-1 13 and E-1 17).  The 9-prong box wiring is
also shown separately in the accessories section on page E-13 4, with an
&quot;8/65&quot; change bar.
