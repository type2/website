I will soon be posting the drawings of the ez-camper cabinets i am
reproducing. I don't know enough about westies to know how similar they are. I
did notice that the closet on a westy is clamped to the bus frame, as opposed
to the ez-camper, which is screwed to the frame.

unfortunately, as my engine needs a rebuild, the cabinets have been put off. I
don't want to post the drawings until i am sure the stuff i built fits
properly. I can't test the fit because where I work on the mechanics of the
bus is on the other side of town from where I work on the cabinets

sorry

Hello again.  My son is trying to determine the cabinet dimensions for the 
Z-Bed he now has for his Panel/Camper.  Do you happen to know or will your 
drawings show this for a 66-Westie or at least something similar enough so 
we can build this?  Thanks.

&gt;the drawings should be posted to www.sv2s_dot_com, scott mcwilliams offered to
&gt;post them there.
&gt;
&gt;as for making your own from the drawings...everything in the set should be
&gt;pretty easy to acquire from any decent lumber yard...some parts like the 
&gt;ice
&gt;box/water tank/water pump. I have no idea how hard those are to get.
