&gt; Maybe mine is missing parts. Mine doesnt seem to have the throttle
&gt; return spring as this one does. My throttle return spring is hooked to a 
&gt; tall bracket
&gt; that bolts down to one of the fuel pump bolts. It has a couple of bends in 
&gt; it and
&gt; the spring is horizontal coming straight back tword the engine compartment 
&gt; lid. 
&gt; Mine also has the ceramic 6V choke element. This carb on e #$Y looks like it 
&gt; has
&gt; a choke element off of a 30 PICT or later and I know the later choke element 
&gt; will
&gt; not fit in the hole because I tried. Mine also doesn't have what looks like 
&gt; to me
&gt; an idle cut off solenoid. Very different from the carb on my bus which is a 
&gt; PICT
&gt; 

Hey guys  That would be for a 1966 1300 cc motor  First year for the return 
spring at the carb and last year of 6 volts. They also changed the gas pedals 
at the same time . went away from the s shaped connector to the little roller 
wheel under the gas padel .  If I remember right the next year went to the 30 
pict  later  mark Dearing
