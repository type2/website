Subject: Headlights

I seldom use my high beams but the other night I clicked them on for
some reason and discovered that they're apparently hooked up incorrectly
- the lights go off when I clicked to high beam.  Annoying!  The PO also
tried to hook up aftermarket gauges (i.e. gas and oil temp, a third I
don't recall what) but only the gas gauge works but not correctly.  The
bright side is at least they didn't cut the dash or otherwise damage
anything in doing that.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,

Donna in Northern California (1960 truck)
