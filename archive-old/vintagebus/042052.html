&gt; &gt;Anyone know of any issues involved in bringing a bus into California 
&gt; &gt;from Canada, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; In 1996 I was working in Kansas City and it looked like several of
&gt; us were going to stay in LA (Fullerton) for six months to a year
&gt; as part of the job.  We asked about bringing our cars to California
&gt; and at the time, I believe you had to pay some kind of &quot;smog impact
&gt; fee&quot; of a few hundred dollars and pass the sniffer test for your
&gt; car.

the smog impact fee is no more.  It was ruled unconstitutional as it was
an impediment to interstate commerce.  Refunds were supposedly issued to
those who paid the fee in the past.
