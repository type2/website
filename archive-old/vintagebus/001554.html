I wonder: Where did all my VW friends go?

VW content:  I met another groovy mechanic today.  It was the sight of his
blue and white '62 Crewcab out in front of his shop that snagged me.  He was
really cool, showing me all sorts of pictures and talking general VW stuff.
That particular Crewcab has been in his family since 1967!  It's really cool
to meet another who is way into the Volkswagen trip!  His name is Hans, of
J&amp;W Motorworks (I think) in Sebastopol.  Seems like a good place to know of
if you're needing help in this area.
