Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Wood Slats

For what it's worth:  The DPO of my DC tried to extend the life of the
original bedslats my siliconing them to the bed whenever a rivet broke
or pulled out of its hole (and there were many).  It was a real pain in
the butt scraping off all that RTV when I repainted the bed and replaced
the slats with a repro set from Randy's.  The article that VW Trends did
a couple years back on Randy's bedslats suggested sealing the
rivet/screw holes with rubber gaskets, which I made by cutting little
squares from an old bicycle tube.  Worked great for me, no leaks and no
gooey mess.

Of course this doesn't address the question of trapping rust-producing
water (or dirt) under the slats.  I keep my DC under cover whenever I'm
not using it so I don't have that worry.

&gt; I will be riveting them on and will be putting clear silicone on the bottom
&gt; of the slats around the rivets
&gt; to prevent water from dripping down the holes.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been to dropgates_dot_com and haven't seen an answer to my question and
&gt; might post it there also.
&gt; But as these lists get read more often and I want to put them in the next
&gt; couple of days I was hoping to get an answer from you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is &quot;Should I put silicone along the entire bottom of the slats
&gt; so that water can not get underneath them?&quot;
