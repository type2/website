Subject: RE: [VB] Paint availability

  I talked to an old painting buddy in cali who has a glasurit rack, some of
the toners have been discontinued, but he can still mix any VW single stage
color by color matching and not off formula.
  Just like in PPG, there are colors now they can only mix in Concept, but
not in the single stage line because the toners have be discontinued to mix
that formula. A good paint man could still match them by eye though and not
by formula

Aside from the price, does anyone know the answer to the original question,
which was this:

The ad says &quot;Glasurit has stopped making Velvet Green in the last two
years&quot;.  Is this true?  I thought colors were just mixed from a Base?  Would
this meant he Base in n/a?
