Subject: glass bead blasting heads



Hi,

Last weekend I glass bead blasted the cylinder heads of the
36hp engine I am dismantling and may rebuild.  I thought some
of you might be interested in details of doing this fairly
inexpensively.

I have an inexpensive 5hp oilless compressor and a gravity feed
sand blaster I bought at Sears.  I bought 50 pounds of 60-100 mesh
glass bead media at a local sandblasting supply for about $21.
I used a 32 gallon plastic garbage can for a blasting container
so I could recover some of the media for reuse but it would
be better to have a real blast box.

Generally, the process went smoothly and I am very happy with
the results.  The glass bead media doesn't remove any metal,
either steel studs, cast iron valve seats, or aluminum but
removes all the carbon and crud quite efficiently leaving bright
shining metal.  This allows careful inspection of the heads for
cracks. (I plan to replace the valve guides myself.)

I was able to recover about half of the blast media by using
the trash can.  I don't think it would be too difficult to convert
a large trash can like this into a real blast box by adding
long sleeved gloves, a plexiglas window, a light, and some sort of
fitting for passing the compressed air into the unit.

I found that it was a very good idea the use goggles, a respirator,
ear plugs and heavy gloves for protection during the blasting
process.  A professional blast helmet/hood would be even better.

Cheers,
