Subject: IRS Suspension In Missouri

HI All, I have a 74 Thing rear suspension for sale in Kansas City Missouri.
It is complete drum to drum minus the axles. I have been told this is a
great way for vintage buses to be converted to IRS and keep the stock
height. The price is $250.00. If it needs to be shipped it will go Yellow
Freight &amp; I will need to be paid for the cost of the crating material.
You can contact me at thingguy_at_kc.rr_dot_com  or my home # 816-781-1321.
I apologize if I have broken a rule by posting this, it won't happen again
if I did.
Thanks a lot,
Scott Sportsman
