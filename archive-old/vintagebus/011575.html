.......I bought the Bus and I have a question for the list.Niantic,Ct. is about 160 miles from my location. (I live just outside of Albany,NY)
I'm trying to come up with an economical way of transporting the 21 window here. - No engine in vehicle. Condition of brakes unknown.I've contemplated getting a hitch for my '79 Bus to do the job, but I think I know the answer to that that question.....  (:o(
            Are there any enterprising listees in Ct. with a flatbed who would like to make some dollars transporting my new found treasure to upstate NY??
       If all else fails, i'll do the U-Haul truck and flatbed number to transport the vehicle here.
     In any case, I'd appreciate any feedback from people who have had experience transporting a Bus 
a fair distance.Thanks in advance......
