I have a walk-thru section that I tried to sell; several people wanted
the seats (must be a high-dollar item judging by who was wanting them)
and nobody wanted the bulkhead itself.

Get a sawzall (you can rent them) to cut it. You can't really cut
metal properly with a wire feed welder...

&gt; Have a parts bus for the front nose( UN hit ) and for the doors( no dents)
&gt; the W. Yard just put it on the driveway! I have some questions : When I cut
&gt; it up, is there a market for  the walk through seats and floor they sit on?
&gt; the back end I thought I could cut it in front of the corners over the top
&gt; in 1 Big section (roof is rusted out) the cargo floor is is good shape... I
&gt; could haul these to a swap meet  or is it a waste of my time?  Also what to
&gt; use to cut it up ?  I know my wire feed welder will cut up bus sheet metal:)
&gt; but I don't have a gas welder. How about a Circ. Saw with a metal cutting
&gt; blade? I have a sawzall but I think I would snap a lot of blades !  Any
&gt; Ideas would be a big help.       Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
