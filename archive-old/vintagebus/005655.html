Things seem to be looking up for plf. A couple weeks ago ,Doug from trans.
rest., reported Dawn finished his side tent. A friend of mine who ordered a
canvas for his poptop in January received it today !! He had almost given up
on it.
I really hope she pulls thru as we could all use her poduct line back on the
market.
