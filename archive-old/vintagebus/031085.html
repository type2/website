People on the left coast most likely have seen the extremely anally re-done
original paint pearl white single cab.  It was at the all truck show and KP.  The
owner might even be on the list.  Nice guy...met him at Pomona once.

This truck was hand rubbed and spot painted (every blasted chip and scratch) back
to very nice original condition!  A bit too much work if ya ask me, but I think
it was more a zen experience for this cat.  Two large foam core boards full of
explanation of the busses history and resto documentation are on display with
this truck when he shows it.

To each his own.  Me, I'm just compounding out my OG paint.  Someone suggested
using OOO steel wool with it to work out the rust stains.  Works great.  Only one
spot is down to primer, so I'm staying away from that.  I'm surprised how nice
its coming out.

&gt; Good spot painting and blend-in is an art in itself.  Not everyone is up
&gt; to the task the first time out, even if you do manage to match the color
&gt; correctly.  The original paint, while great in appearance, may be rather
&gt; thin from years of buffing, making it harder to to match paint depth
&gt; when making a repair.  You start by trying to touch up a small area that
&gt; has been keyed, carefully follow up with wet sanding, and before you
&gt; know it you find yourself re-painting a whole door...
