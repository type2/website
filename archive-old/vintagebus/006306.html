Subject: S.I.R. out of business ???    
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2000 21:00:29 -0800

I got a phone call today that might be interesting to some of you,   S.I.R.
southwest import rebuilders (better known as crap rebuilders)  might be out
of business.  I did a warranty job for a customer a while ago and he never
got a refund check for the labor,  in follow up there phone number is
disconnected and one of there biggest retail pushers of crap (checker,
schucks, kragen) cant get ahold of anyone either.  maybe the vw community is
rid of them ??
