I may be your best friend. I know of a 60 double cab sitting in a junk yard
with its corners still there.
Lookup Averies in Longview Washington and you will find your pot of gold.
the truck has been there for some time I am not sure of the condition the
corners are in, but they are still there. (two weeks ago that is) Trust them
when they tell you the condition there parts are in they usually are better
than stated. If you have no luck there my next stop would be Way-out salvage
somewhere in Arkansas. Finally if you still strike out I can take a drive up
to my secret stash in the hills some time soon and see if a truck that old
with corners still intact is there.

PS if you can't find the phone numbers I should have them both at work.
