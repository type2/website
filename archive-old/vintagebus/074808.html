Subject: Which engine for a '62 ?

Hi there.

I presently have a 1300 CC bug engine in my '62 westy which is asking for
&quot;quick retirement&quot;. (The chassis number is 00890563,
delivered on June 9, 1962, still running on 6 volts).

Instead of having it rebuilt, I'm thinking of replacing it with a genuine
1200 CC engine.

What engine code should I look for ?
Where I could get the original engine number that was installed in the bus
at the time ? 


By the way, has anyone got some info on VEGE rebuilt engines ? In the event
of not finding a good and running genuine VW ?

Thank you for your help and/or advices.


Bertrand, 

From France.
