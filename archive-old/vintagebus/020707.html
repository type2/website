Subject: worse gas milage than most of us (friday)

a friend of mine sent this link to me.  he wants one for his beetle.  if i fitted something like this to my truck, i could cook my dinner on the way to the campout, brag about how instead of hours of driving it'd taken me minutes all while chomping on bbq!
