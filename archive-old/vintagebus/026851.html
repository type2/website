Subject: Re: [T2] Over heating continued: today's work LONG

Have you check the oil pressure reliefe/regulation valves. The one at the pully end (rear) will stop oil passing through the oil cooler if it is stuck closed.
The one at the fly wheel end will prevent adequate oiling of all bearings if it's stuck open.
They use different length springs so you would get over heating if the springs were swopped - look in Bently or similar for how to check operation and which spring is which.

When I had my old bus - I had overheating problems which were due to a previous owner fitting a replacement engine on with a pully wheel that did not have the correct timing mark on - and until I found that I was permanently running hot due to be over advanced.

Good luck

&gt; Over heating continued: today's work LONG
&gt; 
&gt; I know this is getting old, but need more input. I decided that I needed
&gt; additional professional help with the overheating 69 camper. Short history:
&gt; really overheated the motor coming home from Everybus. Put in an idle (2
&gt; years) engine from a 71. Only part reused was the carb. Put on temp gauge.
&gt; First trip of any length was about two weeks ago and got to 240 on flat
&gt; interstate at 50-55 mph. Pulled off to cool. Adjusted timing and carb at
&gt; campout, and stayed hot on the way home. Up to 250 in the mountains in
&gt; third.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, today I boiled some water on the camp stove behind the bus. The dipstick
&gt; sender was about 5 degrees off so those 250 readings may be 255. Close
&gt; enough. I did adjust for altitude.
&gt; 
&gt; I took a spare 34 PICT 3 to be rebuilt last week. Today I went to the shop
&gt; with the bus. This is an independent mechanic with some VW experience. On
&gt; the trip DOWN the mountain on a hot day, I reached 235. This was really a
&gt; down hill drive with the last few miles being rolling hills.
&gt; 
&gt; In the parking lot, I noticed the bus idle go down all at once. Did not
&gt; think much about it. I was out of the car waiting at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; The first adjustment was the 009 dizzy. The timing was about 28 max advance
&gt; degrees but seemed to advance slowly. I thought this was a normal 009 thing
&gt; as I always have a flat spot with these dizzys.  We took it apart and found
&gt; only one return spring. Is this normal? It looks like there is a place for
&gt; two springs, but it appears to only have one from the factory. By the time
&gt; we finished messing with it, we had stretched the spring. That dizzy is
&gt; history for now. We then put on the new carb and a vacuum advance
&gt; distributor I had with me.
&gt; 
&gt; He set the max advance to about 30 degrees. Then he tried to adjust the
&gt; carb. The idle was set to 1000 RPM, then when the engine speed was
&gt; increased, it would only go down to about 1200 rpm. After a few minutes, the
&gt; idle would suddenly drop to about 800 rpm (liked what happened in the
&gt; parking lot before we got started?? ). He worked for a long time on the
&gt; adjustment, but would continue to have the same symptoms.  We had the engine
&gt; hooked up to his machine which showed all cylinders firing, good coil
&gt; function, normal spark, good vacuum. Dwell at 50. At idle in the garage, the
&gt; temp was reading 190.
&gt; 
&gt; We finally gave up and went for a drive. The bus seemed to be a bit more
&gt; strong at higher rpm, but the flat spot continued if not a little worse. The
&gt; engine temperature got up to about 220 around town. By that time, the
&gt; temperature outside (six hours later) had dropped 20 degrees. The trip home
&gt; in cool conditions (mid 60s?) was uneventful, but reached 240 or more going
&gt; up the hills. TOO hot for a cool evening.
&gt; 
&gt; On the way home I stopped for a drink and left the bus running. A guy came
&gt; up to talk to me about the bus and again the idle suddenly went way down
&gt; while were standing there talking. His thoughts were a fuel pump problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Other info: The generator is making a whine. I was afraid to tighten the
&gt; belt too much but did it anyway, as I was concerned with some slipping. Made
&gt; no difference. I had intended to change it out today but found that the two
&gt; I had here were too short. It appears that the size changed around 1970.
&gt; Bummer. Could a bad bearing add significant heat/ drag on the engine?
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, the bus seems to really use a lot of gas. We ran it on and off
&gt; all afternoon, but used about 3 gallons?
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has read all this, thanks! All input appreciated in advance!
