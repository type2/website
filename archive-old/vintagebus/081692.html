Subject: Re: [VB] Speaker location

i've mounted them in the front kick panels, and i've also used some of those
3 ways that come in an enclosure with a bracket mounted to the bottom of the
parcel tray. definetly not hi-fi, but it was good enough for me.


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Back on the list for a short while. Where do you folks put your stereo
&gt; speakers? I am soon to install a CD stereo in my bus and I am not sure
where
&gt; to put the noise makers. In the kick panels under the dash? Maybe in the
&gt; door panels? If so, how to get the wires across the hinge point. Maybe in
&gt; the roof panels ( I have a DD delivery camper so it has the hard board
&gt; panels up there)?
