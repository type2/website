Subject: Re: [VB] Gas geyser

&gt; ...and all over the side of the bus and the LEFT rear tire.

[CRINGE] I meant my &quot;OTHER&quot; left!

Hopefully I'll still get some advice even if that last gaffe was of
embarrassing proportions. Embarrassing? No, really. I have a model of VW bus
right in front of me, on top of my monitor, just in front of the cat which
insists on competing for its space. I was just looking at it head-on, not
from the perspective of the driver. Nevermind that I've been driving a VW
Bus of one kind or another for the past quarter-century -- I'll eventually
remember what side the gas cap's on.
