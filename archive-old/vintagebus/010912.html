But Tacoma is in Washington, about half an hour north of where I live.  BTW 
it is snowy here now.   I drive around in my 65 westy wishing I had a 
Eberspacher gas heater installed, and hoping my fingers don't freeze, keep 
the heat somewhat on defrost and alternate which hand gets defrosted.   
Brrrrr.   Hoping to get to Arizona for BBT whatever the buses are by.

 Thats IT!!!  I'm moving to CA/AZ (Calirizona) tomm.! 
 Enough of these cheap, beautiful busses.  I'm glad,
 and show off, if a magnet will stick to any part of my
 lawn art!  Man, that makes me sick.  Next time, call
 me and I'll split the dime with you, 80/20.
