Subject: Re: [VB] higway speeds

Rob,

Lately I've been treating my bus like a real bitch...one factor is that I have a new motor a few weeks away =)

63 EZ Camper--DP1600, 34pict 3, 010 dizzy, big nut ranch 3:88 trans.

I used to keep it at 62...sweet spot.  The that crept up to 65....and lately I just floor the bus wherever I go.

On the highway portion of my cruise home from work....I run it at about 70-72.

When I make a parts run to LA or Orange County...I run 70-75 most of the way on the I-15 flats.  The grades always kill me with the 1600 and 3:88----that's why I ve got the new motor coming...along with a new tent trailer to pull.

At 70 I'm running approx. 3800 rpms.
I believe I'm alittle over 4K at 75.

I haven't taken a good trip since BBB in Havasu, but it seems like I'm always caravaning to those shows, and keep it around 60-65.

At 70+ my bus sounds fine...I run a Berg dipstick and also use my nose.  If I run regular gas I'll get a flicker out of the light when running 70+ for extended times, when I run premium, I never even get a flicker out of the light.
