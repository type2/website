&gt; Check out the Mercedes at your junk/salvage yards for Hella &amp; Bosche fog lights. Came stock on some models (Karl fills in here) I've seen clear and yellow lenses.

&gt; I've gotten details from Kyle, but could use another source. I'm too tall for my DC, have to hunch over to see the horizon, traffic signals. So I picked up a seat from a 914 and it'll sit between and below the stock rails of my 1/3 seat.  Anybody have these seats in a bench model? How are they attached? Any better seat to use in this case?

Harry,
What about cutting the rails out of an old 914 and then welding them in place?

or

You could always get one of those surplus periscope optics, cut a hole in the roof and you'd be there.
