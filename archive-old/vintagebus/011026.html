 &lt;&lt;The upper and lower inner bearings are 6306 with the C3 rating (hardness

 C3 rated, and the upper outer bearing is the 6305 also C3 rating.  &gt;&gt;

Actually the C3 rating refers to the press fit tightness of the bearing onto
a shaft.  

Thanks for putting me straight on the bearing numbers.  I would have found
