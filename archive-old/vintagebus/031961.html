&lt;&lt; Hello all. I'm pretty new to all this so bear with my questions :~). I'm 
 considering buying a 65 Bus, and can't quite figure out what model it is. 
The 
 VIN is 285097285. As far as I've checked, that comes up as a 7-seater 
 sunroof, which this definitely is not. This is a Kombi camper conversion of 
 some sort--but no louvered windows, all pop-outs. I wonder if anyone can 
help 
 with this VIN mystery. I haven't seen the bus up close yet, so I'm going on 
 pictures right now. Thanks...
  &gt;&gt;
...........
do make sure the bus has a good title for the appropriate VIN.   It could be 
messy to have a changed Vin for the bus.  are you sure that the vin has that 
8?, it might really be a 3?
