Neale Green wrote in part on the type2 list:

&gt;&gt; At the risk of being a tad blunt, while there is merit in the caps/t
&gt;&gt; shirts/stickers etc ideas, if we ALL just donate $5/$10/$20, the funds
&gt;issue
&gt;&gt; won't be a problem.

True, dig this:

For the last two years, membership has held steady at almost exactly
1500 people. That is 500 on vintagebus and 1000 on type2. Some come and
some go but the numbers are remarkably consistent.

If only 200 of those 1500 people would send $15, we would be on easy
street. And that's with buying the new hardware; next year we only need
to buy bandwidth so it'll be a lot cheaper.

It does not seem like a lot to get 200 of us to send fifteen dollars.

Right now we are almost 2/3 of the way there, this can be done! At this
point we are persuading the procrastinators, and I know because I am
one. However, I sent forty bucks (ask Ted if I didn't), and if a lazy
sod like me can do it, then you can as well.

PayPal is your friend; if you open a new PayPal account and use
tedebare_at_one_dot_net as a reference, it gets you five dollars and us five
dollars as well. Even if you are utterly broke, not a dime to your name,
you can figure out how to donate $10 to the list like that. And later
when you get some money you can easily buy stuff off of Eb_at_y with your
PayPal account. Go to www.x_dot_com to get started.

Donations should be sent to:

           Type2 Fundraiser
		C/O Ted Finesman
		8405 Reading Rd.
		Cincinnati, Oh. 45215
		1-877-517-4811 (toll-free for any questions or information)
		tedebare_at_one_dot_net (for pay-pal)
