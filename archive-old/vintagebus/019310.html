Well, here's the way I see it; you have 2 options: pay/beg/barter/force someone to do it,
or do it yourself.  I can't think of a 3rd option.

How much would it cost to pay someone?  Money talks; you might be able to get
it done faster by paying a premium.  

How much does it cost for a welder and the tools you need?  The benefit of
this when it's all said and done, you still have the welder and tools to use
on your next project.

Or, buy the hand tools you need, and *rent* the welder.  If you have all your
duckies lined up, the actual welding time isn't that long; you could get by
with one day's or a weekend's rental.  That's probably the best compromise.

&gt; purchased all the other tools that i would need).  I also do not really have 
&gt; the time to take a class as I want to have it done by the end of May so I 
&gt; can attend the classic.
