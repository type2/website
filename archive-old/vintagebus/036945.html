I wenty to the antique show at the cow palace in san francisco yesterday.
While I was thre I perused a 1966 VW commercial brochure. Ir said that the
spare tire on the singlecab wa stored behind the drivers seat.

I believe that this was chnaged in 63 but the brochure says otherwise. 

My 63 has a pair of arms for the spare in the treasure chest and clara's 59
has the tire behind the drivers seat. 

Is this a mistake by the VW sales dept??
