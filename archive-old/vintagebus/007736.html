&gt;(Ive checked the archives and library, but there's not too much talk about
&gt;15's) What kind of  (radial) tires would give me stock appearance (please
no
&gt;meat cleavers!) and stock ride height , while giving a decent ride.   I'd
&gt;love some numbers for reference and maybe some brands.(ps. what were the
size
&gt;of stock tires).

I just got done asking the same questions.  I have 15&quot; rims on my bus and
there is very little available out there regarding small truck duty tires.
If you have 14&quot;, the option are still narrowed but you have a helluva lot
more than if you are stuck with 15&quot; rims.

Currently, the only LT (Light Truck) size available (this is in either 6 or
8 ply sidewalls) are 205's.  A 15&quot; rim is 4.5&quot; wide and a 14&quot; is 5.5&quot; wide.
I didn't like the look of the P205/15's on such a narrow rim - it looked
like an over-inflated balloon to me.  So I spent hours and days scanning the
net and finally settled on a Tranpath S/U from Toyo Tires.  It's only a 1
ply sidewall but the tire is rated for between 1300 and 1400 pounds.  It's
also listed as acceptible for use on Sport Utility vehicles (probably like a
Geo Tracker).  I know I've chosen a tire that according to the list
concensus is sub-standard but I've made the choice and will live with it.
Oh and the tire is a 195 - it looks nice on those 15&quot; rims.

Ronnie at www.type2parts_dot_com is going to check at the SEMA show about having
some LT 195's made but I couldn't wait until November or December for my
tires.
