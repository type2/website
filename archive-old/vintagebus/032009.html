Hey Isaiah,
That's very true as far as mentality for big trips like that...
I'm 18 (as you know already) and have been driving aircooled vdubs since I 
was 16.
I own a '59 panel (just out of restoration), '74 super vert (my first vw), 
and will be looking for a solid driver when I take off for school in Eugene, 
Oregon next week to tool around in out west... I agree that vdubs aren't 
something that any inexperienced aircooled person would want to take across 
the country without proper provisions (refer to Eric and Barb's roadtrip 
packing list!) or knowledge. Granted, I'm no great mechanic, but I can do 
enough to get me where I need to go and maintain my vw's...
Being such a young enthusiast does have it's disadvantages, but, for the most 
part is pretty exciting. I think alot of this has to do with the great bus 
folks in the midwest that we have... The DBG especially. They are very 
supportive, enthusiastic, and helpful towards us youngins'. I sure hope that 
I can meet some great folks like them out west!!!!
I know this is way off topic, sorry list...
Heres a quick ?
Dawn _at_ PLF forgot to send me the velcro I attach to my bus... Is it the same 
thickness as the velcro on the bra or is it thinner... She's impossible to 
get ahold of so?

Thanks guys,
Pete
