Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] wtb: Westfalia mattress foam

I am using a memory foam matress topper for my bed in my pop-top and will do the same for the lower bed eventually.

It is nice stuff, new cars are starting to use it.

I bought it from overstock_dot_com for about 90 bucks.

 I was just out, and found a fabric store that had 6 samples of foam.. 4 were 
&gt; definitly tooo soft.. 
&gt; but the other 2 are difficult to chose between. I would think the &quot;rock&quot; hard 
&gt; one might be better 
&gt; as it will deteriote over time and work in to what I want.. ? But that might 
&gt; mean 10 more bad 
&gt; nights sleep.. or maybe 10 years of bad sleep till it works in...
