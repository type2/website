&gt; Hi Jamie,
&gt; They were built on a swivel seat body which is alot

I may be committing blasphemy here, but could you just
convert the bus to a walk through by making the same
sort of bulkheads as many Bays have &amp; welding them in,
so long as it doesn't involve cutting anymore metal
i.e. the hump which rises up from the floor &amp; has the
seat mounts on it.
Just a suggestion.
If that seat mount hump is still completely there I'm
with the general consensus of a replacement bulkhead. 
Besides, otherwise you have to find another spot for
your spare.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
