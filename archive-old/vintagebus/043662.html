&gt;So I'm thinking about some sort of low cost anti-theft device.

Rent a Corvette, get the loss/damage insurance, and park it unlocked
next to your Bus.  :)

&gt;Is there any sort of consensus on the kill switch idea.

Ask five Bus owners, get seven answers.  :)  Doing a boolean search
for &quot;kill AND switch&quot; at http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/search-vintagebus.html
yields some previous discussion.

&gt;I was thinking about putting a switch in one of the lines coming from 
&gt;my fuse box and hiding it somewhere in the cab. Which fuse would be best

For a traditional kill switch (another switch in series with your
ignition switch), there are two things you can do - interrupt the
starter circuit (Bus won't crank, but could be started by pushing)
or ignition circuit (Bus cranks but won't fire).  If you want to
kill the starter, you have to pick up the wire you want at the
ignition switch (the red one connected to terminal 50 - this is
the red wire at the ignition switch that does NOT come from the
headlight switch). If you want to kill the ignition, you can
pick up the wire you want at the fuse box - look at the second
fuse from the left and find the end with two black wires.  Remove
one of them, tape the end, turn the key on, and try your turn
signals - if they work, you got the right wire, but if not, you
want the other one.  Once you have the right wire, the switch
goes between it and the place it was connected on the fuse box.

For Astrogeek's method:

&gt;I like the method of grounding the points.

you need a wire from the engine compartment to the switch, and a wire 
from the switch to ground.  The wire from the engine compartment connects
to the same coil terminal that the distributor connects to.  You *can not*
make this connection anywhere else in the Bus.  When you flip the switch,
it simulates your points being stuck closed, so your Bus will crank but
not start.

If you are forgetful or your Bus is often driven by someone who is,
you may want to have a spare coil on hand.  Leaving the ignition on
with the points-grounding switch on will fry the coil *if* done
for long enough.  A few minutes won't hurt but longer and you will
deplete the battery and maybe kill your coil.  This is also why
radios in VWs are typically wired to work without the key on.  Not
trying to scare you off this idea; just giving a heads-up.

I hope this helps!
