I think that it is good that Bus Boys is on the rebound now.

However, I don't think that telling a vendor ahead of time that you are going to
report on their service to this list is a fair approach.  I'd guess that 99% of
vendors would give good service on that request.

The true test is whether they can do it to the majority of the list.

For the record, this post has absolutely nothing to do with Bus Boys
whatsoever.  It is merely my assinine opinion :)
