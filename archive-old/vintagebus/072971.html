Subject: RE: [VB] friday question - coffee names

Here's some, although I think I may be a bit late:

88mm Stroker - That's your stand-the-spoon-up, tar
black, first cup o' the day blend.

25 Horse - Decaf of course.

Safari Windows - A mild African blend suitable for
sitting &amp; surveying the scene.

Eberspacher - A strong, flavoursome, German style
suitable for after dinner or with a good donut.

There you go......
A bit lame but fun.

:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless

&gt; to be all bus related.
