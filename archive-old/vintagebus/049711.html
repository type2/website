Message-Id: &lt;v02140b0eb3381434782e_at_[196.2.38.68]&gt;

&gt;Scored a mint decklid at Phx.bug-rama today,but no one i`ve talked to seems
&gt;to know what it belongs on.
&gt;Looks identical to a 58` decklid,but has pushbutton instead of churchkey??????
&gt;Any clues???
&gt;
&gt;
Sounds like a Brazilian part -- the Brazilian splitties (built until 1976!)
had the flat-style engine cover, but without the centre brake light. This
style was fitted to German buses only for the US mnarket in 1958. The
Brazilian engine cover has the 67-style push-button latch
