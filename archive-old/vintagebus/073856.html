Subject: Re: Misfire help needed on my '57...

Thanks everyone : )

I'm on my day off now so I'll get myself buried in the engine bay.  The 
trouble when you're recomissioning an old truck is that you do so many 
things it's difficult to keep a track on what you replaced might be 
causing the problem.

To me it feels electrical, but I like Clara's note about the reserve tap 
as I replaced mine with a new one and I wasn't happy that the cable was 
quite long enough to put the tap on full open, but of course because all 
my fuel lines are steel I can't see any fuel to gauge how much is 
getting to the car so I guess a transparent filter from pump to carb 
might help - shame I have to cut the 46 year old fuel pipe.

I reckon the tank is pretty clean as I had it caustic and steam cleaned 
and fitted a new gauze filter at the tank, also when I swapped the 
reserve tap the filter had only a few minor bits of rust stuck around it 
and the filter on the pump is clear and *lots* of fuels comes out the 
filter cap on the pump under gravity - and there is the fact that it 
fixes itself whenever it like.

So:

I'm off to get a new coil, condensor, points and fuel filter...
