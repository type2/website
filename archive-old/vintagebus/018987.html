Subject: CB Performance dry sump pump info??
Mime-Version: 1.0

Anyone have one/ever use one?  Will it fit behind the T4
fan shroud? (yeah it's a T1 pump but it is flat cam and should
fit the case fine with minimal clearancing at the most.)
They claim it to be an OEM Shadek pump with their own
custom made second stage.

Basically if someone has one I want to know how far past
the case it sticks out and what directions the pipes run off
in.  I bought a race prepped 914 case off ebay (shuffle pins,
piston oil squirters, 1/2&quot; through bolts, cromoly head studs)
for a ridiculously good price set up for dry sump and although
the guy is giving me a tank he no longer has any oil pumps.
He claimed to use a 2 stage Melling (maybe by EMPI) in the
late 80's that fit behind the shroud, anyone know about
that one or have one to sell?

Anywho this is going to rectify the MS engines overheating
issues permanently on the rebuild, plus I like the idea of
dry sumping when using an external cooler anyway and
maybe eventually when this thing makes it into another Bus
for offroading to boot.  The CB price is right at $99, if I
was doing a T1 I figure I'd be using a dry system for sure.
