Anyone ever see the &quot;boots&quot; that the police put on parked cars when they
haven't paid their parking tickets?  I used to see them alot in San
Francisco and remember thinking &quot;how would you ever get that off?&quot;  So I
happen to pick up a law enforcement magazine  at work (I work for the man)
and come across an ad for a device called Tire Lock.  Follow this link
http://www.tirelock_dot_com/anti.asp .  Looks like a pretty cool addition to
your regular alarm, club and ignition/battery/fuel pump kill switch.  Price
on the thing is $350 plus $85 for the lug cover.  Like someone else said,
how much is your bus worth to you?  On the other hand, like every other
anti-theft device, if they want your bus/bug bad enough... **I have no
affiliation with this company** just passing on the info.
