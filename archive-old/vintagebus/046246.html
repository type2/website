&lt;&lt; Hey guys and gals
 I woke up bright and early to pull my motor today to see where the oil
 is leaking from.  I suspect that I have an o-ring flywheel and I didn't
 put an o-ring in it.  It was leaking pretty good.
---------------------
if you have a 6V 180 mm FW, odds are it is stepped, not O ring.   If you have 
a stepped crank, An O ring FW with leak, though you can use a stepped FW on a 
later crank.

Is it oozing gear oil?  then how about that rear tranny seal?  

good luck.  SOunds like you are the engine pull pro now.
