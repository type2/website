Subject: Single canvas flippy ting

So hi folks,
that canvas flip thing, it actually hinges to one side?
Would it support a 70lb canoe?
Where can I get one again?(lol)
Anyone have diagrams showing it &quot;tilt&quot;?
Anyone make some wood framage and wrap some OD canvas over it?
TIA

PS anyone use a 34pict on a 1776 with like an engle 100?
What's the best bang for the usage? ie, I would be happy with a forged 1600
set and total seal rings with minor head port or just polish and a nice
exhaust, anyone try similar setups lately? Is the 1776 worth it for sure? My
bottom end will probably get me around fine for ?miles, 1776 requires
machining, heads,etc.
Also, I have a 74 beetle DP motor that I am dealing with here. Is this case
full flow design compared to earlier? Would it support a cooler out of the
pump cover?  I have been considering taking the chance of a medium sump and
a full flow filter pump, got the doghouse cooler, do I need more? Even if I
ever go through central america?
