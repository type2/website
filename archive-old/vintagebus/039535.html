hey all,
i installed this mini tach i had in my old bus in my driver this weekend. i 
was curious cuz this bus has a small nut in it. what is redline in a SN 
tranny? as i was watching speed and RPM through the gears, some questions 
came up. according to the red shift points on the speedo it would seem red 
line would be about 4200. BUT, in fourth cruising on the freeway this 
morning, around 60mph, my rpm's were about 4500. am i RIGHT THERE? ready to 
blow the trans? now, on this newly paved area of freeway near my house, my 
bus FLIES! sometimes i will look down and be pushin' 70!! WOW, slow down. i 
run 185/75's on 14's. when traveling i usually maintain about 62mph. if it 
creeps up, i slow down. my tranny is smooth and quiet, i dont want to F 
anything up ;)
thanks for the help, hope this makes sense,
