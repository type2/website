Howdy Guy's,
           I'm a newbie to this talk list and finally feel that I something 
to post.  My name is Mark Pribanic, I'm 27, and live in Neptune Beach, Fl. 
(Jacksonville)  I've owned and driven a split window since 1994.  This past 
year I've acquired and sold another five splits, always looking for and 
finding an older bus in better restorable condition.  I am in outside sales 
and cover a large portion of north Florida and southern Georgia in my sales 
territory.  Its amazing how many buses are sitting ripe for the picking for 
parts or restoration in these area's.  I currently own and drive a '56 
single cab, '54 oval &amp; a '58 356A Porsche.  I've been known to attend most 
VW or Porsche events in Florida and Georgia.  My favorite show always being 
NEATO's Das Kool Bulli's gathering every November in Tampa.  This split 
window show was/is hosted by DKB, NEATO's only Florida's chapter.  It 
typically attracts 60+ splits for a fun day of swapping and hanging out.  If 
you live in the east and haven't attended, I highly recommed it.  It mimics 
the OCTO/Classic weekend format.  Sat being buses and Sunday the largest VW 
gathering in the state of Florida. Thanks goes out to Mike Brown and Kris 
Heinicka for hosting a great time.  I'm sure those names may sound familiar 
to a few on the list.  Hopefully I'll be making the trek to the Classic this 
next year.  I've been a member of NEATO since 1994 and my true interests lie 
in split buses.  Particularly, in pre '58 buses.  When not working I can 
often be found surfing or tinkering with one of my vehicles.  With that 
being said I'd like to invite all split owners and enthusiasts in the North 
Florida/South Georgia area to join a new chapter of NEATO forming.
    There are currently 18 members in the River City Bulli's.  The majority 
of which I'm still trying to twist there arms to make that long trip to the 
post office to mail in their NEATO funds.   We meet once a month at the 
Hooters of Regency in Jax.  This past spring we put on our first show, Buses 
by the Beach, in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.  I felt it was a success with 
only 18 splits showing up.  With DKB's participation this show could easily 
hit 50+ buses.  This was held on a Saturday.  Sunday was an all VW show with 
100 participants showing up.  Again emulating the OCTO/Classic format.  It 
is that time of year again, and our second annual Buses by the Beach is 
approaching.  We expect this year to be bigger and better than last year. 
Why? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. The site for the show is about a hub cap 
throw from the ocean.  The temperature this time of year in North FLA is 
typically very pleasant, with the highs in the upper 70's lows in the upper 
50's.  The ocean temperature also is quite nice hovering around 70.  So 
bring your surfboards, sunscreen, and buses for a fun time.  All buses 
participating are able to swap and sell in front of there bus.  There will 
also be used parts vendors selling their wares. Awards will be given as 
well, my two favorites being longest distance and oldest bus, to encourage 
those Barndoor owners to share their beauties with the rest of us.  This 
weekend is perhaps one the best weekends of the year to come to Jax beach.  
It is the annual shrimp festival weekend and draws thousands of people from 
around NE Florida.  The shrimp festival is located only a few hundred yards 
from our VW show and attracts a diverse group of people browsing the show 
vehicles.  There is an excellent campground located on the beach named 
Hannah Park, and plenty of hotels on the beach or if you prefer just off of 
the beach.  If you have any question regarding the now forming River City 
Bulli's or the 2nd annual Busses at the Beach show, I can be reached by 
email or phone home(904)246-5537, Cell (904)910-9548 or work (904)262-5102.  
Also if you want to drop by while passing through town give me a ring.  Hope 
to see ya there.
                                   Mark
