hey all, I thought I would share this.
Yesterday I pulled in to my local dealership with my 65 singlecab. I parked
up front where everyone could see me, breaking the monotony of an endless
sea of shiny new cars. The young &quot;professional&quot; looking couple that was
standing in front of the parking space took one glance at the truck and with
a look of confusion and disgust on their faces headed for the security of
the showroom. As I started inside the salesman next to me points at the
truck and says&quot; you know they are coming out with those again in a few
years&quot; This time to look of disgust and confusion was on my face. &quot;yea I
know&quot; I replied, &quot;but they aint gonna be like that, and I wouldn't trade in
that&quot;, pointing at my truck&quot; ,for one of the new ones&quot;. 

later
