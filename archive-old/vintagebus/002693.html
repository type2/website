I'm gonna try to respond to all in one shot,
1. I'm about as photogenic, as a horse's a** for one , thats why i'm seldom
in the pics on the web pages. Neil was the best at sneaking up on me and
catching me not looking and getting one by me.
2. I got to many Iron's in the fire as is at this moment, To  attempt any
thing of this statue.( i really hope ya'll were joking)
3. The web cam thing has been brought up by my nephew the puter geek and
undergrad at ECPI in Greensboro, this might happen, Due to having 2 puters
bite the dust at the first of the year, funds are quite tight at the moment,
so maybe a bit later in the spring we'll revamp  my old faithfull p 166mmx
and get that going, No SOUND ,,i tend to get parental rating when things get
to be a pain, Grin, SO if the webcam thing is an idea ya'll would be
intrested in let me know, and we'll dig a bit deeper in to it.
4. The shop leasing idea is dead. Or at Least this most recent one is
anyway, I has deceided to hold off, do some rearranging and modifing to our
present shop add a helper, Get things to a higher volume and be more stable
to justify some of the issues that were involved with it. So to all on the
waiting list your still there but ck in with me in about a week as to where
on the list you are, k?
5 On the body work post , we do minimal body work, no painting except for
POR- 15 or similar work, Why the list is so long is simple we don't
half-a**ed do our job. We take pride in what we do and do it as best as we
possibly can.That will not be sacarficed, under no circumstances.
It seems that even the smallest jobs are turning into monster rustorations.
Kents 56 is the worst vehicle on our line- up, Scotts 55 and Jim's 57 are
tied for second, mainly because we are having to undo poorly did work before
we can  repair the units as to our specs. this also makes it difficult to
estimate a job,
Well hope this answers some of the lastest posts today  if not p-mail me
,,later i'm headed to bed,
