Hi Richard, Get a laptop, then you can sit in the drivers seat, or in the
open cargo doors, and compare the diagrams with the actual wiring. The
screen makes good auxiliary lighting too.

&gt;Thanks for the info Thom.  I will probably buy one for my 69 (too many
little skinny wire connectors) once I get the 63, 56, and 54 done.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for posting the wiring diagrams on your page.  Very helpful.  I have
many of them in my old manuals, but it is nice to have that many of them
there to compare on the computer... And, when my hands are all greasy and
dirty I would rather come look them up on the computer than get my vintage
books all grubby.  They still make keyboards :O
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again,
&gt;Richard (now I just need a computer hookup in the garage for easy wiring
diagram viewing) K.
