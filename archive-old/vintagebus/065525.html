Subject: Re: [VB] re:6v to 12v converter

You've got it right. 6V x 3 amps = 18 watts.

Advertising claims of high power are BS if the size of the wire and fuse 
leading to the stereo won't carry the juice. That s*ny probably has an 8 
amp fuse. 12v X 8 amps = 96 watts and divided by 4 channels = 24 watts 
per channel.

18 watts divided by 4 = 4.5. That's not a lot of power. Maybe you'd be 
better off with just two speakers at 9 watts each.

&gt; the inverters say &quot;converts 6VDC to 12VDC at 3 AMPS Maximum&quot;
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; So basic electronics P=IV, so power(watts) = current(amps) x voltage(volts).
&gt; So i got 3 amps max, and 12 volts, does that mean 36 watts? or do i use the
&gt; original voltage of 6, and get 18 watts. or am i just completely lost?
&gt; any suggestions on this appreciated.
