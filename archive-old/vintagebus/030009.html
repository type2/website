Subject: Good weekend in So Cal

  We just arrived home from a long weekend of VW fun.  We attended the
SOTO meet at Wolfburg West and although we did not find many parts, we
came away with the grand prize of a set of deluxe belt line exterior
trim.  Philip voiced his idea of  cutting it to use on the ddr camper
but after a few boos and cat calls, decided not to.  Since Philip's next
vw purchase will be a ddr wt panel or double cab (looks like double
anything) to compliment the camper, it looks like the trim will go into
storage or become trading material.

  We also attended the SV2 Christmas Party in San Clemente and it was
amazing how the number of door prizes matched the number of people.
Everyone seemed to have a great time until the present exchange got into
full swing and there was a lot of theft.  The most stolen gifts were the
many creative hand made items.  Scott's Busopoly was a work of art.
There were hand made wind chimes, christmas ornaments, a quilt, bean
bags, the bus hat, customized SV2 ice chest, the stretch (kyle would
have liked this one) and monster bus models.  There were also many other
bus presents including the much sought after Road &amp; Track Show Stopper
bus and trailered beetle.

  It was hard getting up the next morning at Pomona where many of the
folks from the previous day's events gathered once again to swap parts
and stories.  We met up with the three back POs of our camper.  They
were very glad to see that the bus had a good home and was able to spend
so much time on the road.

  We also began the task of collecting parts for a new engine.  We found
a new universal case, SP heads, and a lot of the parts we will need for
this stock  conservative 1600 SP.   We have not done this before so we
will be looking for some recommendations on putting together a
dependable engine for our road trips.  We are still looking for balanced
crank? Rockers? Balanced flywheel? Carb? Distributor?  Recommendations
please.

All in all - a good weekend
