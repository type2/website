Subject: RE: [VB] Church key holder?

It also opens the engine lid up on pre '66 models. 
As far as the name sake goes I have heard many a prayer directed directly into those &quot;doors&quot; after the little key opens them and I have heard the &quot;lords&quot; name used quite a few times when they are opened. Although the later is usually used in the most unfriendly of ways........
