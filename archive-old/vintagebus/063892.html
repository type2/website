Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

How Low is this Bus?  This 66 I've been working on for 2 years now has an
IRS Rear that I'm fairly sure is 3 inches low, it's only been off Jack
Stands twice in the last year.  I can take the Back Tires off fairly easy.
205/60/15.
Again I may not have it dropped has much has I think.  The Front set lower
than the Back last time it was off.
I lower it for better handling around town and the IRS rear.

By the way anyone on the East Coast have a resonable priced 68/69 beam.  We
can work a trade for a 66 Beam with dropped Spindles, New Brakes, HArdware,
New Pitman Arm New Tierods and ends,  I'd trade the thing for a 68/69 Beam
with Disk installed on it or a good rebuilt balljoint Beam with the PArts
for Disc from a 74^ Baywindow.
