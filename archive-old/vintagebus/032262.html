I always wanted it to do just that. I hearda report on NPR about the insane
costs of funerals these days. There's a whole new market emerging for
&quot;discount&quot; funerals. I heard that it cost one family a thousand bucks to
have their dear departed transported from the viewing to the graveside
which was less than a half mile. So, you could pay off the cost of the
$16.5k over not too many weekends if you could stomach it.

That, or I wanted to take it to SV2s campouts and really freak people out
by sleeping in it....hehehe
