Subject: Re: [VB] cardboard? headliner

Sounds like you need some seals! Somehow water, cold
air or something is getting in your bus. Make sure
your seals are good then try to re-insulate your bus.
It really isn't that expensive. Your local home
inprovement store should have either pink fiberglass
or NASA bubble/foil insulation. You can use contact
cement to keep the foil stuff on the body and use the
pink stuff as well. 
Go to wwwtype2_dot_com in the library section for more
info on this proceedure, it will walk you through it.
Wolfsburg west has the correct grey hatrdboard roof
panels you are looking for.

Good Luck,
Sean
