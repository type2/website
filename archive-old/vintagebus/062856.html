Subject: RE: [VB] New WCM &quot;Felts&quot;???

  WCM only makes 1 style felt and that is what you got, no notchs, cuts etc,
just a cheap blow felted extrusion.. That is why I sell parts from numerous
different suppliers to get the BEST of what is out there. Wolfsburg West are
made in Brazil. I have Italian (had those made) and Brazil.

ps. Just made; window slider base felts for the windows without the holes.
These are available for trade only,limited sets. The manufacturer is always
looking for cool bus parts (not cheap)

Subject: [VB] New WCM &quot;Felts&quot;???



i just ordered some WCM &quot;felt channels&quot; for the front door 
windows, and they are drastically different than the ones i've got in the 
past. first of all, it came as one solid roll that you have to cut yourself,

rather than the 6 pieces listed in the catalog. not a real big deal to 
me.

the strange thing is that there is NO FELT on the rubber!! 
yes, there is a very thin layer of some kind of material on the rubber, but 
that's what the old ones look like after 40 years!

i called WCM, and a guy supposedly went to the warehouse 
to look, and said they were indeed &quot;fuzzy&quot; textured. i called the shop i
ordered 
them from, and they said the other sets they had in stock were NOT 
&quot;fuzzy&quot;.

has anyone else received the non &quot;fuzzy&quot; type from WCM? i 
want to (and am going to, regardless) return them, but if i keep getting the
non 
&quot;fuzzy&quot; type, why bother? i'll have more i shipping than they cost!

anyone purchased them from Wolfsburg West lately? are they 
&quot;fuzzy&quot;?
