Subject: RE: [VB] BNNTA Trip 

A couple of years ago, I made the trip down to Tampa, FL for the Bulli
Brigade, from NE GA, about a 14 hour drive. Just to see if I could make
it.

My speedo cable broke on the way down, and at one stop I had to jump the
terminals on the starter to get going (in pouring rain, in a puddle),
but I made it there and back....

I guess it is all in how you see things. I think the trip is just as
important and interesting as arriving at the destination. I enjoy
getting passed on the interstate, sometimes by waving girls! I've broken
down a couple of times on the road (understatement), and learned a lot
about my bus from those misadventures...

I hope you are a patient man. VW buses, kids and dogs require a patient
personality...

david
