Hey everyone,
	I've just been on a streak of good luck lately for finding old
buses on old farmers properties.  This time I found a 1965 kombi that has
been parked for 20 some odd years.  It's really complete and it's a
walk-through.  It even has the emblem on the nose still!  Anyway, the lady
only wants a couple hundred dollars.  I could probably have it running
soon.  The engine still turns and brakes still work, that's a good sign, I
think!  Anyway, how rare is a walk through really?  I've heard that they
are a rare option, but I've seen an aweful lot of them around.
