Subject: RE: [VB] SO-23 rear fuse block

  JP just showed up with the Westy fuse block and we went out and compared
it to the headlight one in my 57 B#G and they are different.
  The westy one has 4 wire connecters on it and the one in my 57 only has 3
with the side with only one block has a jumper like on a bus fuse block.

hope you understand this

ps. JP made it from NM to here in 8 hours 20 drivng time gauged by his new
GPS, not bad 550 or so miles. It's funny Rustybus heading east and JP
heading west, crossing in NM.

Hi JP,
That looks just like a 56-60 bug, K/G head light fusebox!  Eric&amp;Barb
