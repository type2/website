&lt;&lt; Hey guys.  My engine if from a 61 beetle.  I'm not sure what size it is. I 
recall the PO saying 1400 but it's been a while.  I thought with the right 
jets the 28 PCI would work OK?  Am I wrong? &gt;&gt;

Hi Jdd,
The 28PCI with it's 21.5 venturi would be way too small for a 40HP 
1200-1400cc engine.  Best to work with the 28PICT or a 28PICT-1 carb with 
thier 22.5 venturi for it.  Eric&amp;Barb
