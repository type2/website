I, unlike thom, could never get over the idea of it twisting all the way 
around on pre-59 busses.
So I leave all the 1$ ones for you Issah.
Ive seen those sell for 90$ on ebay before, 25$ is more than a decent price.
Dreamland swaps???? hahaha
I dont think there is such a thing.
If you have ever been to Pomona, you would be choking at the prices everone 
asks.
I turn to ebay for the great deals!

&lt;&lt; You must remember though that not everyone gets to go to all these 
dreamland swap
meets.  I don't think that 25 is a bad price really.  The price includes 
shipping
and all which I would estimate to be about $5.  He went through the trouble of
making them and making them look nice...give the guy some credit...geez!

Anyone want to step up and sell me a shifter extension for $1???  I'd like to 
see
that happen!

The guy goes through this trouble and all you can do is insult his price by 
saying
how good of a deal you've gotten on other ones?  Some of you get free buses 
even!
Does this mean that all of them should be free??

the nerve of some people....

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; I'd prolly get my butt kicked if I mentioned I've bought originals at 
swaps
&gt; for $5 including the bakelight knob. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; damn, I dont think Ive paid more than a dollar a piece!
&gt; I remember once when my friend had 20 of these end to end in his highroof!
&gt; Now that was cool!!!!!!!
