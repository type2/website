Get yourself to the wiring diagrams on Thom's site and all will become
clear. &lt;http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring?&gt; IIRC.

&gt; Help! I just ran a new harness in our 65 to rid ourselves of gremlins in our
&gt; electrical system. Our wiring diagram only shows one wire coming from the
&gt; wiper, but we have three (brown, black, black/purple) Anyone know which
&gt; terminal on the switch these go to (54d,54,31b(54 has 2 terminals))? also to
&gt; which terminal does power go? Already lost a days work. Many thanks. Chris &amp;
