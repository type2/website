&gt;Define &quot;will fit&quot; - I've seen the bracket mismatch, and it
&gt;ain't purty.  If you needed to rig it up this way to get yourself
&gt;out of the Sahara Dessert (chocolate sauce mirage) then fine; otherwise,
&gt;you really need the correct brackets.

ok, im not trying to be cheap here, just wanted to know if the brackets were 
the same. so they arent. OK. cool!

if the correct (pressed) brackets were bought with the bumpers, will they 
bolt right up to later buses? (buses produced after the pressed bumpers were 
standard)

*sigh*
