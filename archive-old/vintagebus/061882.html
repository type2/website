&gt; It is currently a 1600 DP. Since I'm rebuilding it, I could go bigger but I'm don't care much about

Kevin,

Well, not really.  The extra strength will help if you are over
stressing the motor like revving it to 7K at every stop light or drag
racing.  I guess pulling a heavy trailer up steep grades could be
considered over stressing too.  You'd have to be doing it quite a bit though.

You'll get more longevity out of the motor you build if you use a
counterweighted crank and make sure you balance everything to a nat's
ass (not sure how much that weighs).  If you are keeping it under
5K(rpm) I think a cast crank is fine.  Keep compression to around
6.9-7.1.  Get a NEW case and heads with some of the money you saved on
the cast crank.  

This is just my very limited experience and personal opinion (only built
3 motors).  Others with hundreds of motors under their belt should chime in.
