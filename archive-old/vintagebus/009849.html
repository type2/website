Hello Rex,

    Sounds like the valve is &quot;sunk&quot; in the valve seat. Place a straight edge
across all the valve stems ends at once, see if the that valve stem is
protruding more then the others (this also weakens the closed valve spring
pressure slightly). If so, the right fix is to re-do the valve grind, you
may need to replace that valve seat to get the correct stem height. This way
you keep the rocker arm geometry correct. When the geometry is right the
relation to the valve stem, push rod, and rocker arm is 90' at 0 lash.
    Now like the earlyier post, the quick fix is, shorter push rods, shims
under the rocker arm assemble, grind the end of the valve stem.
    Good luck, let us know how it comes out.
