Hi Volks,

Everett Barnes &lt;everettbarnes_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; I was doing some light reading of my wiring diagram a few
&gt; days ago (1955 Bus) and I noticed that the diagram
&gt; indicates the wiring sizes as in 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 6.0,
&gt; etc..  The numbers seemed to not correlate with wiring
&gt; gauges sold at my local hardware store so I was wondering
&gt; what the numbers meant?

I believe that's the wire thickness (my dictionary says 
&quot;cross section&quot; for the word I cannot remember, &quot;Querschnitt&quot;,
so bear with me) measured in sqare millimetres.

How to convert this to your awkward gauge numbers (hey Joel,
I remember 'em faintly :-) I am not in a position to say.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
