Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel dating question- crows foot

yes, the earlier ones with the 'ridges' are called crows feet for some 
reason.  There was a discussion about  this in the summer I think,  Maybe 
look under 'crows foot' in the archive.  THink the bottom line was they were 
made by different companies, and the change was around 59.  Maybe David Mayes 
wants the crows foot rims for his DC- was that the date he was looking for?  
and would trade you some later ones.

 The dates that I have are:
 1/61 (x1)
 5/60 (x3)
 10/58 (x1)
  
 The wheels from '60 and '61 are the same, but the '58 wheel has ridges
 between the lugnut holes and the hubcap retaining clips. Does anyone
 know when they switched from this style to the smooth style? I checked
 the archive with no luck.
