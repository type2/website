&lt;&lt;I just want to drive my bus and enjoy it without any
more back breaking labor being put into it.&gt;&gt;

If thats what you wanted, why did you put so much effort into the
&quot;exotics&quot; of big valves, pistons, cylinders, etc. . . why didm't you
just order a brand new in the crate 1600 engine from Mexico??
