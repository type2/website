&gt; Keep in mind that these pins have been reproduced widely.
&gt; Buyer beware!

Indeedy.  I found two of them at antique stores with the &quot;original&quot;
clasp-type pin but have no idea if they're repros (pix at
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/whatsis/ - scroll down).  I showed
them to a guy I know who's into German WWII memorabilia and he said as
far as he could tell they looked original.  One source told me that
after the war, many of the molds for Nazi stuff ended up in the eastern
bloc countries and were repro'd for black market collectors -- so there
are originals, postwar &quot;commie repros&quot;, and new ones.

Jerry's message (just read) tells me that what I have are likely postwar
repros, since they're not that light.

They're cool, albeit spooky.  IMO only the (presumed) originals are
something I'd want.  Hard to get behind a reproduction of Nazi symbols
-- I'd start lying awake at night, wondering about my motivations.... 
Bad enough as it is. ;-)
