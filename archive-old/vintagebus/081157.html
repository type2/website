Subject: re:clutch thump

I have a similar problem with my bus, but only after driving around for a
while-like on the highway, then slowing down to the end of the exit ramp,
and when I go back in gear(usually 1st) I get a heavy thump....never been
able to determine why...I'll check the Bowden tube I guess, but I'm not sure
what it is supposed to look like...
