Subject: Re: [VB] Overheating generally (&amp; Degreed Pulleys)

&gt; You should also watch out for recirculation during slow speed operation.
&gt; the purpose of the tin is to put the air inlet far from the hot air
&gt; outlet, which you defeat if you remove the tin.

This appears to not be a problem.  Most likely due to the lower tins being
in place, forcing the cooling air to be dumped out the back, and not near
the 'new' opening.  Unless, I were backing up, then it could.
