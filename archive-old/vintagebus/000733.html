Hi Todd,
You can install the very thin walled 12 volt outer dia. with the larger 6 
volt inner diameter bushing.  Then as always use lithium grease (Not the 
white stuff!) with some graphite (Yes, you can use pencil shavings after 
screening out most of the sawdust.) mixed in to lubricate the inner diameter 
of the bushing.  Eric&amp;Barb
