Hi Eric...

Having just replaced my axle boots with the engine out (clutch repairs) I
would say that pulling the engine is easier than working from underneath the
bus...there are an awful lot of teeny screws,nuts, washers, and unless you
like greasy dirt particles in your eyes while you strain your
arms......surely you can find another reason to remove your engine....fun?


&gt;Hope everyone had a good weekend.  How difficult is it to change a tranny
&gt; boot with the engine still in (66 bignut)?



Who is &quot;sprouts&quot;?  Is it kids, the name of the bus, or what?  I saw a hippie
bus in Sebastopol sometime in May....was red, with groovy-looking
psychedelic painting on the brow.  I stopped to say hi and the guy told me
he was from the Eugene area, and that his name is Sprout.  Any connection?

...hopefully in the next 3 weeks for High Country, me and sprouts first
&gt; event.  I'm hoping a tranny boot and MC will do the trick!
&gt;
