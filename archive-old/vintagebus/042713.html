Sucks?

I suppose so, i have pulled engines in t4 vanagons several times, and in a
t4 bus once or twice, and in my 71 bus several times... (and a couple of
times in watercooled american cars)

I look forward to pulling my splitty engine because by myself, given no
complications its out and on the floor in 15 minutes or so... ahh the
bliss of it :)

take care,

Steve

P.S. no matter where one asks for advice in the end we are responsible for
our own actions.  My watchword is to research until i think i know what im
doing, and if i goof, its my fault and no-one elses.
