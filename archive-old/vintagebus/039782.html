&gt;
&gt;Regarding the &quot;special&quot; (but not &quot;SO&quot;) model codes,
&gt;ie 21A, 22A, 21F (etc)
&gt;

Thom, my m-code plate has 27D written in the top left corner.  It's a '67 
deluxe, so I don't know what it could mean.  Help me out on this one?  
Couldn't find much on it in the type2 library on m-codes.
Thanks,
-wes
