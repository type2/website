Welcome Jeff!
[...]
I personally think that there is a huge demand for photos on the WWW related
to body repair and identification.

In fact, I'll venture to say that when it comes to these two topics, plus
locating a bus or getting together at shows, there is no better use for the
mailing list.

Cancer repair and undoing PO changes are the types of things that I think
require social interaction... the last thing we want is someone making it
worse or unknowingly putting on the &quot;wrong&quot; correction part...

My second question is a philosophical one. I've been lurking on the list for
about 3 months now and I'm wondering where I might fit in. I'd love to post
links to detailed photos of my bus and get expert opinions on my project,
keep the list informed of my progress etc., but I notice there's a lot of
discussion
of Newbies not respecting the intent of the list. I understand the &quot;check
the
archives, muir, sermons (not available now right?) before you ask what the
proper spark plug gap for your particular model year is&quot; idea, but what
about
&quot;check out this rust &lt;link&gt; what do I do first in my particular
circumstance?&quot;

I love to hear what the group thinks about the role of the newbie. This
thread
may have been hashed over and over for all I know, but I am a newbie right?
