First off, please don't take this personally - this is not an
attack, personal commentary, hippie bashing, etc, etc.

While I'm a big fan of having the bus up in the air, once I looked
at your pix closely, I'm  kinda worried.  While your jack points may
be in super shape, there's nothing to keep gravity and leverage from
ripping them right out of the car if that thing became unbalanced.
There doesn't appear to be anything tieing the individual stands to
each other, so a single one, if tripped over, caught by a cord
or an air hose, could begin a journey indepently of his brothers.

I've had a VW slide over with the factor jack and tweak the jack point, 
that was with one corner up and only a foot or so off the ground.

The other potential probelm I see is base area - the legs of each post
only extend a foot or so past the width of the car.  If you did try
to roll it, and hit a cord, it would &quot;trip&quot; quite easily.  If it
did start to tip, the wheels would speed up the process, kicking out
and bringing it down in very short order.

Suggestions?

At a BARE MINIMUM I'd connect the 4 contraptions together somehow,
with a rigid connection, either bolted or welded.  This would prevent 
one of them from migrating away from the others.  Secondly, I'd make 
some sort of &quot;outrigger&quot; to the sides, to make it harder to tip.  I think 
there's a rule of thumb like the base is 1 1/2 times the height.

I have a set of casters that I made for my '54, that are almost the 
width of the torsion bars.  If I made another set, I'd make them
at least the width of the torsion bars, if not a little more.  Don't
underestimate the effects of a lightened bus!  I got a little surprised
one day with my '54: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=kill+me
