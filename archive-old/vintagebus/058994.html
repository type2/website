Subject: RE: Vintage VW Luggage

Yes--VW luggage was available to VW owners in the 50s and perhaps as late as
the 60s--Each piece was designed for a specific area in the VW Bug--Behind
the back seat--under the front bonnet, etc.--At the last Bad Camberg show
there was an NOS set for sale that I took a video of--Have no idea if you
can read the manufacturer's name, in the video?.  Again there &quot;May&quot; have
been more then one, manufacturer, as the VW had more accessories made for
it, then any car.--It was Not &quot;Samsonite&quot; as so often this is sold,as VW
Luggage, due to the angle of some Samsonite luggage pieces--The NOS set,
still in Plastic at Bad Camberg &quot;I Think&quot;? had a price of $1800-- and it was
still there at the end of the day--, uj

PS: But, VW Bus people due to the size of their vehicle, were able as always
to
put just about anything and everything into and on top of their
Splittie--guess that's why we choose this VW.
