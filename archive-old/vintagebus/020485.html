&gt; The reason tempered glass is not used for
&gt; windshields anymore is that it
&gt; is too brittle. If a big pebble hits a laminated
&gt; windshield _at_ 55mph, you
&gt; probably get a big star shaped chip with some
&gt; spiderwebbing. If the same
&gt; pebbble hits a tempered windshield at that speed,
&gt; you are likely to get a
&gt; faceful of glass cubes. 

Exactly that happened to a one of the guys from
Albuquerque after Volkswagens on the Green in Colorado
recently.  A mini-tornado hit him as he was exiting
the show, and broke his tempered glass passenger
windshield into little bits.  (It was a european
highroof bus.)

He said that glass got in his hair, his eyes, and his
mouth, and he was lucky to keep the bus out of an
accident.  If I recall, tempered glass windshields are
not even legal in the US!
