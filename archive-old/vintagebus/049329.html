&gt; Since I've just begun my conversion of an all original 65 Camper into a
&gt; rolling shell, anyone have their favorite order in which to dissassemble,
&gt; repair/replace, then reassemble? I've already cleaned out ppo's personal
&gt; effects (slippers, shoe polish, taco bell hot sauce, electric bills, etc.),
&gt; removed most of the camper interior and floor. My goal is to turn the bus
&gt; inside out, and do a respectable resto. Here's where it's at:
&gt;
There's more than one way to skin a cat, so there has to be more than one way to turn a bus inside out. Weld a plate to the dashboard, hook a half mile long steel cable to it, run it out the back hatch, attach it to an immoveable object. Heat the bus until it's glowing white hot and drive as fast as possible, jump out at the last second. Or you could wait until Michiu Kaku finds a friendly wormhole to dip it in.
