&gt; I would like to know what oil filter was used in this full-flow.

&gt; ----------------------- clip -----------------
&gt; From the diagrams in Tom Wilsons book it appears that all oil doesn't go
&gt; through the filter all the time, in reality oil that is bypassed just
&gt; goes back to the sump if there is sufficient volume and pressure to
&gt; activate the bypass plungers.
&gt; Does that sound right?

No. The full-flow filter is a modification
installed before the OPR valve, where
the pump output is blocked and oil
exits the case the returns through 
the galley which it originally should have.
Thwe Wilson book does not show 
any filter on a T1 engine.
