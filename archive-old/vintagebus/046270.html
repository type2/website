&lt;&lt; The far right hand fuse in the fuse box gets extremely hot when the lights 
are switched on. This fuse seems to be the most heavily loaded of all, since 
it seems to handle the main power supply from the starter (battery), as well 
as serving the headlight circuit and a couple of others. &gt;&gt;

Hi Fig,
The main red wire from the starter to the fuse box does not go through a fuse 
on it's way to the head light switch.  It sounds like the brass clips that 
are pressed into the fuse box have corroded and/or loosened in the fuse box.  
You either need to replace that fuse box or better yet solder all the clips 
to each other preventing a bad connection that cause the build up of heat.
