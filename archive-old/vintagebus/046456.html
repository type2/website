Was Writ:
&gt;&gt;You want a Badass Looker get you a lowered DELUXE Split-Window!&lt;&lt;

Been there, done that in my younger reckless days.  My Split looked cool, but
all the bouncing was horrendous.  I had to stop and go to the bathroom every
10 miles, spend hours in traction, and had my fillings jar loose.  But hey,
it looked cool!
