Subject: RE: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

I live in Australia &amp; if you're one day out of
registration you're illegal.
Our rego system includes compulsory 3rd Party Personal
from a seperate insurance company.
It used to be part of the registration fee but they
said it would be cheaper to have private companies
provide it &amp; you know how long it took the insurance
companies to push the price up........
If you buy a car &amp; it's out of rego &amp; isn't about to
be re-registered you have to hand in the plates &amp; if
your busted with plates in your garage you can be
fined.
You also can't get a day ticket to drive the bus to
the RTA(our equivalent of the DMV).
It's supposed to be ready to register.
The cops turn a blind eye if you put cardboard plates
with TRAFFIC printed on the car when you're taking it
for an inspection but you really don't have a leg to
stand on legally.
My wife saw a car the other day with the cardboard
plates spelt &quot;Traffick&quot;.
I wonder if they were advertising their product :o)
I've simply trailered or tilt-trayed my buses around
if they were out of rego.
It's not worth the risk &amp; half the time they needed
work on the brakes or the engine so I had little
choice.
One things for sure.
If I had proper plates for the bus I tie them on with
string rather than drive around without them on.
:o)
