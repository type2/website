&gt;I have one each Black, Green and White wires in the harness and the
&gt;outlet has terminals at 12 o'clock, 2 and 7 o'clock.

This is the recessed male plug that goes in the side of the Bus, right?
I don't know which o'clock is which but you can easily figure it out
with an ohm-meter or self-powered test light (continuity checker).
The green wire should go to the terminal connected to the ground pin -
the round and slightly longer one.  You will have two flat blades -
if one is wider at the end then it should connect to the white wire.
Otherwise, imagine looking at the prongs from outside the Bus with
the two blades on the left and right and the round ground pin at the
bottom (it makes a little face, two eyes and a mouth).  The white
wire should go to the right-hand blade and the black wire should go
to the left-hand blade.

To make sure you got it right, use a 120v test light or a voltmeter.
Plug an extension cord into the Bus and into your house.  Be *careful*,
as you're dealing with 120 volts!  Check the terminals on the inside
of the bus -- try the test light or voltmeter across each possible
pair:

black-white  120v / light on
black-green  120v / light on
white-green    0v / light off

If you get the above results you are good.  If not, UNPLUG THE EXTENSION
CORD before troubleshooting further!

Good luck!
