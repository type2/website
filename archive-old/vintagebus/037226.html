hey... I'm a greatly inspired 16 Year old who just became the proud owner of a
new (for me) '78 bus.... now I don't know a lot about these great vehicles yet
so I need you guys(gals) to help me out.......


The previous owner told me that the heaters on these things we're gaseoline
powered, and because of this, his friend (the origional owner from CA) took it
out, I just wanted to know if it was possible to fit an electric heater, or if
they made any heater kits for this beauty, ('cause I know I'll sure as hell
freeze my ass off come winter time)... Here's the specs for anyone who is
willing enough to read the rest of this letter: Now the bus is still in the
shop with a mechanic on it trying to get this thing to pass inspection, I got
my fingers crossed and so far, so good. I just bought a new set of tires at
sears, windshield's being replaced, since the car was titled in CA I had to
send the title all the way back there (from NJ) to get it cleared with MV so I
got at least 2 weeks to find this heater. thanks again for reading this poorly
constructed letter

Laterz yo,
-Aaron
