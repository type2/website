I have been thinking about making one of these for a while now.  My 
configuration was going to use a 2 cycle single stage snowblower motor and a 
VW generator.   I was always told that in this application a VW generator 
would be better than an alternator.  A generator produces power even if the 
battery is at nearly 0 charge.  Whereas a alternator needs a moderately 
charged battery.   This way you could use the deep cycle batteries until 
they were out of charge and then only run the engine to recharge the 
batteries.  That way you would not have to listen to the thing all the time.


I figure this would work great for the VW camper and my D$dg# pickup camper 
as well as my 1959 Play-ette camper trailer.

Anyone have constructive critizism on this?

Thanks
Mike

Since a good number of us busers like to campout, here's a great site that
gives tips on how to make your own generator and run it on propane if need
be.  Check it out:
