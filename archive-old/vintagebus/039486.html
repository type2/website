the rear main is probably what it is if the pool was in the center. this can 
be a common problem of buses that sit for a while (years) in varying 
temperatures. the rear main gets hard. the oil cooler would leave a pool 
more on the driver side... a little more decieving cuz of the way the oil 
will run down the heads as it leaks. just my opinions. only about $3.29... 
shipping for the thing is more!

when you pull the motor, label the wires... you'd be suprised how easilly a 
few wires can get mixed up!
