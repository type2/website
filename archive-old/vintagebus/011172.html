hi all,

a couple of years ago on the lists, everyone was recommending
that if you
have a busted windshield on your split, just go get one cut to
fit and
drive away..........
Why does no-one just get a piece cut anymore?  Its cheap. its
easy. its
quick.
I guess maybe its the whole vintage thing, everyone wants a logo
i
suppose...

The consensus of the list from the earlier thread, as I recall,
is as follows:

If you do not require vintage glass with the correct logos, you
can have your friendly local glass shop cut some for your bus.
 For safety reasons, however, you need to use laminated glass
for the windshield(s).  This will keep the glass in one piece
and out of your eyes/face if a large rock hits the glass.  Shower
door glass was given as a candidate for the windshield because
it is laminated.  All modern cars use laminated glass for the
windshield.

The side glass can be non-laminated, but should be tempered.
 To get tempered glass in the right shape (because you can't
cut tempered glass) you have it cut to shape and holes drilled,
then have it tempered.  Tempering makes the glass stronger. 
Also, when tempered glass breaks, it goes into tiny pieces rather
than into large sharp dagger-like chunks.  All modern cars use
laminated glass on the side glass.

My '63 has all new, from the &quot;glass shop&quot; glass, with the exception
of the rear corners.  I have VW Venezuelan corner windows with
lava lamp style bubbles in them.

The end.
