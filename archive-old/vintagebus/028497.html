yea, sounds like fun.
start with the roof. do it in sections. make a cut across the top where the 
Zbed would be. then cut the window pillars and around the back corners. then 
cut driver side window pillars and cut across to cargo doors. you'll get the 
hang of it. i cut the entire nose off my bus and mounted it up on the wall 
of my garage... looks cool :-D

the floor and frame stuff gets a little hairy. lot goin on down there. it 
was scary how easy my Sawzall cut through my RUSTY frame like it was butter. 
good thing im not driving it anymore.
