If anyone is interested I have found a source for competitively priced Gedore
tools which VERY similar to the wrenches that would have originally came with
your VW toolkits. (Originals generally had Hazet-West Germany stamping on
them, whereas this says Gedore-Germany otherwise virtually identical, even DIN
number is the same DIN895)

They have both sinlge and double headed wrenches from about 6mm to 70mm.

Contact is Spae Naur in Kitchener, Ontario. 1-800-265-8772. They sent me an
HUGE 500+ page catalouge, gratis.

p-mail if interested

Michael
