&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I heard you have a 'playhut' that is designed to resemble and early(1949-1966) Volkswagen Transporter or &quot;Bus&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I searched your site and did not find it.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Someone on a mailing list i am on said they saw one (a 'playhut' that resembled a VW bus- not the 'school bus') at a retail establishment that was manufactured by your company.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can you verify?  I am a VW enthusiast and would love to inflict this hobby upon my young son in the form of your VWbus 'playhut'. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; sighting.
&gt; &gt; You know those fold up indoor tents for kids?  There was one shaped like our 
&gt; &gt; favorite auto.  So cool it makes me want to go out and have kids.  The 
&gt; &gt; company is called &quot;Playhut&quot; and it retailed for $19.99.
