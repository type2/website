OK, this isnt really a trip report, but it's a bit of a story.
I took some friends up to the Sunshine Coast this weekend in my bus, to 
visit a friend Sat. night and camp out Sun. nite.
All went well until Sunday morning when I was trying to get out of my 
friend's steep gravel driveway.  The first time I tried, I stalled out 
halfway up, since the combination of a beetle tranny and 1500 motor 
don't make for easy uphill driving.  The second time, I backed up into a 
flat area to get a running start, gave it plenty of gas, the back wheels 
spun a bit and BANG! a loud noise was heard.  With a sinking feeling, I 
cut the motor, backed back down into the level area and informed my 
passengers that the bus wouldn't be going anywhere for a while.
I knew that my left axle had popped out again.  I've had ongoing 
problems with it and it was only held in by three of six bolts on the 
outside, since two broke in a minor camping mishap this summer and I 
broke off a third one last month trying to tighten it a little too 
zealously.  I've been waiting for a friend to get back to me about a 
replacement stub axle, so I hadn't fixed this problem yet.  Anyway, all 
six bolts were sheared off inside the axle stub.  
To the amazement of my friends, I managed to find a parts store in 
Sechelt (a very small town) that was open (this on a Sunday on a long 
weekend) and buy an easy-out, some drill bits, etc.  My friend had a 
drill that must have been 50 years old, all metal, heavy and with no 
reverse on it.  I had no luck at all with the easy out, but the drill 
eventually spun all the broken bolt ends out the back of the axle plate 
except one, which was stuck.  So I went with 5 out of six, and we were 
back on the road.  All within the space of about 3 hours.
That night we went camping and the road was super rough.  I bottomed out 
about four times, bent my muffler and sheared off the horn wire where it 
exits the bottom of the steering column.  I was driving a bit too fast 
since it was getting dark and we still had to set up camp.  So I guess 
this weekend I'm fixing the horn wire.  Anybody know the best way to 
feed a new wire through?  
Also I'm wondering what type of muffler has the best clearance?  The 
muffler I have now is a basic style, it curves to the right side and 
sits pretty low to the ground, although it is bent up about 2&quot; higher 
than it should be, so that the back of the bus (is it called the rear 
apron, or is that just for a bug?) is all bent up to accomodate it.  
Also, the right side heater box bracket has popped out so it's super 
loud.  Maybe a back bumper would help protect the muffler, but I'm not 
really convinced that it would.  All suggestions welcome.
