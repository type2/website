&gt; &gt; Where did you get the stud installer/socket

&gt; &gt; I mean to add a 8 mm and 10 mm stud installer

&gt; Luckily, the stud screwed right into the case insert.  
&gt; If it didn't, I wouldn't have been able to get the old one out 
&gt; without extreme measures!
  
&gt; They should be screwed nearly to the bottom of their hole

The idiot book said to install the studs with vise grips 
(in the procedures) or use a double nut (in know how)
the installer i remember had a socket body with one or 
three spirals in the body that mated to the threads on the the stud.

OT related question

In a head nut re-torque scenario, would a stud loose at the case  
not torque all the way to the 23 ft/lbs spec due to friction of the
nut against the head and threads on the head end?

Hence, to coin a phrase, a &quot;floater&quot; stud that 
torques to spec cold, but when stressed by normal operating temps.
and loads, goes out of spec due to loosing at the case end of the 
stud?

Maybe a dab of blue loctite would help? I hear that red loctite 
is permanent and you would have been SOL with your broken stud,
George. 

So,-

Could I pre-test this blue loctite bond to 23 ft/lbs, 
with my handy soon-to-be-acquired stud installer
or a poor boy double nut setup  
and my &quot;lighter&quot; torque wrench?
