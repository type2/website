In the orginal message vwstuff posed the question:

&lt;&lt; -so can i CHEAT and slit  the gaskets to fit onto the 
&lt;&lt;tranny and seal with sillycone or some other  sealer?? 
&lt;&lt;Has anyone tried this short-cut?? results?? or ?? pull tranny 
&lt;&lt;and do it right?? 

Well, that last statement pretty much sums it up and it seems
that Barb and Eric agree:

&lt;Hi,
 
&lt;Pull everything out, the paper gaskets are what set the play 
&lt;in there and if  you do not get the right amount of paper gaskets 
&lt;in there your axles will bind.   

Eric &amp; Barb&gt;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that I've said that.....

You don't have to slit the gaskets to get them to fit.  Drain the trans
and expect a mess.  Loosen the axle boots and take off the nuts/
washers holding the flange to the side cover.  Slide the boot down
the overtube to clear the studs.  Determine the thickness or how many 
paper gaskets/shims there are and replace with new ones. Be sure 
that the sidecover area and studs are very clean.  I like Loctite #518 
($$$) for a flexible sealant and I think that Eric and Barb prefer
Permatex Aviation sealant (??  sorry if info is incorrect).  Make sure
that the gorilla that installed the flanges last did not overtorque and
dimple the holes where the studs go through.  You need a flat, clean
surface to ensure the reseal will work. I paint mine sealant on using 
an acid brush- try and get a coat over the shim surface (both sides) 
like a fingernail polish or a thin coat of paint.  It doesn't need to be
an inch thick to work correctly. I also like to coat all of the shims 
while others only do the surface that contacts the sidecover and the 
axle tube flange.  Reinstall and refill the trans and keep fingers crossed.  

Remember,

Cheaters never profit

There never is enough time to do it right the first time but always
enough time to do it over

And I'm sure that there are several other holier-than-thou type sayings
but I can't think of them right now.
