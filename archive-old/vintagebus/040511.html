Hello list,

I checked the library, and I'm still a bit mystified.  Here's the story:
My bus:
1964 kombi, vin 1176847  Production date 30 Sep 63.  hacked wheel wells by 
DPO.

Donor wheel wells taken from a 1967 parts bus.

I was under the impression that my bus came after the big nut/taller RGB 
gears/taller wheel well change on the assembly line.  I went to compare my 
donor wheel wells to my bus, and the wheel housing (the curved panel right 
above the tires) on my bus is completely curved, no flat spot at the top.  
On the donor wheel well panels, the wheel housing has a flat spot at the top 
like this:
   __________
  /          \
/            \
/              \

So does that mean that my bus is a small wheel well bus, not a tall wheel 
well bus?  I can mod the '67 wells to fit with a little extra work, no 
problem, but knowing the size of the wells would impact the tire sizes I 
pick up.  The bus has a big nut tranny, I have yet to take the RGB's apart 
to see what size they are.  History of the tranny is unknown though.  Innie 
vents, big rear hatch, big later brakes BTW.

Thanks for the help!

Mike A.
