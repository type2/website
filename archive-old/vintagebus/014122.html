I am sorry for the delay on these. I had received a tip that Wolfsburg West
had these in stock, so I kind of put it off, then I actually called them and
was told the following:

WW-&quot;We don't have them anymore, but we should be getting some more in soon, I
am not sure when.&quot;

Me-&quot;When is soon, do you think by the end of the year?&quot;

WW-&quot;I just told you I don't know when.&quot;

Me&quot;Thanks&quot;

I am wondering, if they don't have any idea when they are getting them in, why
would he tell me that they were going to be arriving soon.

Anyway I think i received enough response to order the seals, but a few of you
seemed concerned about price. I was emailed the price of 9DM which is
apporximately $4-$5 a pair. I am going to inquire as to shipping costs, and
time for delivery and will let you know. Hopefully I will have an answer by
the end of this week.
