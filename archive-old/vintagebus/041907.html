&gt; &lt;&lt; It might be a good idea for the Site to carry a message that states that

&gt; Hi George,
&gt; We also thought this up today and then shot it down.  The problem with this 
&gt; is two fold:
&gt; 1.  If one was not on the list all one would have to do is claim to be 
&gt; somebody on the list, preferably someone from far away so there would be less 
&gt; chance of the local listees knowing if it is a real listee or someone else 
&gt; using a list name.

I suppose that someone could do this, but I doubt that someone who simply
gets a printout would go to all the trouble of stealing another's
identity.  The fact that their license plate doesn't match the &quot;far-away
state&quot; might be a tip-off.  For that matter, you could simply check their
driver's license if you smell something fishy (note that I resisted a
really _great_ pun here!)

&gt; 2.  Or those whom want to could just join, but punch in a phone number off 
&gt; the top of thier head.  Thus AIRS ends up with all sorts of dead end numbers!
&gt;   So the AIRS list would have to take up issuing photo IDs and checking 
&gt; regularly all the phone numbers to insure they are correct!   Eric&amp;Barb

You're assuming that the freeloaders would want to go to the effort of
registering just in case they break down.  I doubt that many would have
the forethought to do so.  After all, they don't need to register to get
the data, so few would bother to do so.

I recognise that the potential for abuse exists, but I'm not going to lose
much sleep over it.
