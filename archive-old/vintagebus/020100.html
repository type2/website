I just got back from the DMV. 

(you know it can't be good news when the story starts 
off with &quot;I just got back from the DMV&quot;)

Recently, I bought a '60 (built sept. '59)DC with a set 
of PRISTINE yellow with black lettered CA plates. 
Yesterday, I received new plates that are 7 digits of 
reflective ugly in the mail. I go to the DMV (insert 
rant about lines, rudness, etc here) to fill out 
a &quot;statement of facts&quot; of how I didn't want them, I 
didn't request them, that I have both old ones in good 
shape and please Mr. bureaucrat can I keep the old 
ones?? Hopefully I won't get some by-the-book bean 
counter who will deny my request!

I find out by mail in a few weeks...either &quot;yes, here is 
your new registration&quot; or &quot;no, go turn them in and get a 
set of crappy new ones because we want to be able to 
read your speed by radar more easily!&quot;
