I was discussing this thread with my husband, Bob, who's a physicist.
He says there is an exception to the rule of using a conversion factor
when using a crows foot on a torque wrench.

A crows foot used at a right angle toa atorque wrench typically does
not need a correction factor. When the crows foot length is 1/5 (or
less) of the torque wrench length, the error in torque is less than
2%, which is insignificant for most applications. I.E. 100 ft-lbs
becomes 102 ft-lbs.
 
     1           1 = 1 inch crows foot 
    ------       5 = 5 inch torque wrench
    |    /       5.1 = effective length of the combination
    |   /        
  5 |  /  5.1    
    | /          
    |/
 
This is all based on Pythagoras' Theorem -- the square of the
hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides.
