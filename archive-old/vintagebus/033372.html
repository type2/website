Subject: Black and gold plates
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

This sucks!!  I went to California DMV to get my tags for my 63 kombi.  Well, 
they gave me new plates!  They said that only vehicles 1962 and older can use 
the old plates even if those plates were the orginal plates.  I have the old 
black and gold plates.  I call my local Senator office to complain about it.  
They were going to look into it.  It is state law.  And I want to change it!  
So, beware if you have the old plates and you want tags for them in 
California.  They will give you new ones....Don't give them the old ones!!!!! 
 If anyone knows a way around this let me know.
