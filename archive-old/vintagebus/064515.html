&lt;&lt; Does anyone know how piston size changes the braking effort required to
 produce the same amount of braking force?
 
 Thanks

normally barndoor buses have 19mm master cylinders.  However, if the crusty 
one on the bus is bad, you can physically install a cheap. easily available 
55- 66 mc (21mm), w/o mods.  When I got a 19mm/bd one, I installed it.  the 
bigger was tighter, the smaller gave more squish, and better feel... less all 
or nothing.  So bigger means more force per effort.   Now the physocs whizzes 
will explain why this happens
