Duh everett!
Dont you know the biggest they make tatami sandals is Size 9!!!
That wouldnt go too well with Thoms size 19 feet!
And no girl would be caught dead at a VW show in pumps....
And besides, everyone knows the &quot;G* Style&quot; consists of CONVERSE!~

speaking pigin english, haggling over barndoor parts - DON'T BLOW MY COVER!

Dude, pumps don't go with a Kimono, everyone knows the latest pimp style is
with Tatami Sandals.  They are available from Birkenstock so your feet float
in G* style.
