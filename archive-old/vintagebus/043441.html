&gt;I have been having trouble getting the drivers side cylinders (1&amp;3 I
&gt;think) to run very well. At idle I pull the plug wires for 2&amp;4 and
&gt;there is a huge drop, I pull 1&amp;3 and almost nothing. When I go to put
&gt;1or3 back on there is a quick surge and then back to nothing.

Some ideas, in no particular order...

Head bolts loose?  You probably would have noticed this when trying
to adjust the valves.

Is it possible to swap your carbs side-to-side?  If the dead side
follows the carb, it's in the carb, but if not, it's spark or
compression.

How's the heater box on the dead side?  Plugged up or free flowing?
Kind of hard to tell without taking it off the engine, though. 

How do the spark plugs look?  Pull all four and compare the &quot;good&quot;
side to the &quot;dead&quot; side.  If they all look the same, good, but if
the &quot;dead&quot; side plugs look like they haven't been firing, find out
why.

In all the ignition stuff you haven't mentioned changing the wires...
might be a cheap sanity check at this point.

Another idea might be to take out all 4 plugs, then plug them back
into their wires.  Ground all the plugs (but not to the fuel line
or carb, please) and have somebody crank the engine while you watch
the plugs.  Do all 4 have nice sparks or do the two from the &quot;dead&quot;
side have weak sparks?

Is your distributor shaft tight or loose and sloppy?  If it wobbles
around, the rotor may not make good &quot;contact&quot; for two cylinders -
but I think if it was this sloppy the rotor would hit the inside
of the cap and you'd know it.

Distributor cap on correctly?  Once on my Dad's '74 Bug, I found
that the cap had been installed 180 degrees off - the little plastic
tab on the cap rim was not in the slot in the distributor rim.  The
wires were on the right places with respect to the rotor position,
so it fired at about the right time, but the cap was free to wiggle
around a little bit, causing a bit of trouble at high speed.

With a Pertronix, there are no points, right?  Is the spinning part
straight and correct?  What I mean is, most electronic ignitions
have a little thing that goes on the distributor shaft with &quot;arms&quot;
or &quot;vanes&quot; that trip the sensor at the right time.  If two of
them are bent, they may not be tripping the sensor reliably all
the time.  Or maybe you somehow got the wrong spinning part, with
only two arms, so it doesn't fire two of the cylinders at all...

When you go to adjust the valves, do the valves for the &quot;dead&quot;
cylinders operate at the proper time when you're turing the engine
with a wrench?  What I'm thinking of is maybe your cam was installed
wrong, so the cam timing isn't right...but I think this would tend
to affect the whole engine, not just one side.

I hope this helps!
