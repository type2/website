&lt;&lt; Gloss or Semi-Gloss, what say you? &gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
Definitely semi-gloss.  As the powder coater of ours would state it is a 70, 
or more likely a 80% gloss semi-glosss.  60% is definitely too flat, and we 
did our last batch in 80% which might be a tad too glossy, but looks 
fantastic.   Eric&amp;Barb
