So far this year, I've only seen discussion of a group purchase of _propane_
heaters.  To me, this is OK if you have a late model westy, but it seems so
much more practical to go with gasoline heaters.

My goal is safety and simplicity of maintenance first.  Meaning I'm not
wanting to rebuild a rusted out one, but I am willing to clean up and test a
good used one.  Heck, I'll even consider the purchase of a NOS or NEW-NEW
one.  As I understand it, NEW-NEW isn't cheap... but I really don't want
another &quot;project&quot;, I want one in working condition.

I am still familiarizing myself with my '63 crew, and I've been searching
the archives ... a couple of questions come up:

   1) Is the ONLY place that the heater boxes exit heat the two vents below
the windshields?  Are there no ports in the back seats or on the floor in
the front?
   2) As I understand it, there are gasoline heaters designed to mount UNDER
the seat in the back.  This is an alternative to the &quot;traditional&quot; gasoline
heater that mounts in engine compartment.  (yes?)  Has anyone installed one
of these in a Crew Cab that previously didn't have one.  Where does the hot
air exit?  Is there a kit that comes with explaining where to run fuel lines
and other goodies, or do you just figure out your own solutions?

Last but not least, hint hint, I may be in the market for a gas heater.
Looking for one that is a) complete.  b) used or new, but see a.  c) German
(Esp) preference over USA (Ste-Warner).  d) Crew Cab design over engine
compartment design.

All and any info on topic, including some idea on going $$ rates,
appreciated.  I'd like to keep this a &quot;public&quot; discussion, as the season is
upon us.
