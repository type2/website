&lt;&lt; Hi,
 it has a brand new paint job. All the rust is gone. It's my daily driver,
and I'm worried about salt on the roads next winter.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jay,
Well there are many types of undercoatings and inside of panels coating to
repel the rust.  Roofing tar, Zeibart (Spelling?), and many others that can
be used and most should be applied once a year.  In the end though the salt
roads will win, and this is the reason most volks in those states that use
salt during the winter, drive sacrifical modern cars during the winter and
replace them about every 5-10 years.  Thus saving thier VWs for the warmer
non-salt weather driving!
