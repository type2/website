OK 2 questions...
First,  I keep reading that dd buses are rare (or atleast uncommon) but it seems like there are a ton of them around. Ronnie says there are 5 in Havasu, I know of 3 (including mine) in Houston, Thom even has one...
Is it just that I notice the DD's more than the others? Are they uncommon? How uncommon are they?
Second,  On the passenger inside latch of the first cargo door there is no handle, only a screw, no square thing to mount a handle to.... the drivers side cargos have handles on both. Should there be handles on all the doors? I know the pass side latch has a different # than the drivers side (well, diff letter 'A' vs 'C' I think)
Thanks,
Brian
