Well, after about a month of doing absolutely nothing to my '59 Kombi
project, I went and visited it. I was able to re-evaluate some decisions I
had made before. It's amazing how after spending some time away you can
look at things with a more clear head. I don't seem to be bogged down so
much in the details. I had been looking at the bus and thinking about
things for over an hour before I even thought about the wheel wells that I
welded in. Before, they were just that...welded in home-made wheel wells.
Now they're just part of the whole. 

Moral of the story is to take a break every now and then to &quot;re-group&quot;.
Spend some time with the wife and kids. Read a book or two (non-VW of
course). Play with your dog! Then get back on that horse and dig your
rested heels in deep!
