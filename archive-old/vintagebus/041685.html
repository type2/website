&gt; I don't understand what's so opressive about a law that keeps people from 
&gt; turning their front yard into a junkyard.

The problem is the definition of &quot;junkyard&quot;.  I have a neighbor (a
Caddy-driving new-car salesman) who has objected when I parked my
well-used-but-good-condition '71 on the street.  This was a registered
daily driver!  To this guy anything that is more than a couple of years
from the showroom is &quot;junk&quot;.

The problem with these laws is that they are intrusive.  Today they are
telling you what you can keep in your front yard, and you can bet your
bottom dollar that tomorrow they will be telling you what you can keep in
your back yard or garage.

To me, the line is drawn at the property line.  Yes, I keep a nice yard,
but my daily drivers are in the driveway and my RV is on its 
specially-built driveway.  They just passed a law here that prohibits RVs
from parking on the streets, and I wonder how long it will be before they
come after the one in the front of my house, or for that matter how long
it will be before they notice that Westys are technically motorhomes.

&gt; If you choose to live in a neighborhood (it is YOUR choice, afterall) where 
&gt; junked cars on the street and in your yard are frowned upon, then have the 
&gt; *common courtesy* not to have junk in your yard or on on the street.  If 
&gt; you want to have 50 busses in various states of disrepair, then simply MAKE 
&gt; A CHOICE to live in a place where that's OK.  It's not rocket science.

What if your are being forced out of your house because a special-interest
group decided to pressure the city council to prohibit your activity?  It
happens, and a group of old car fanatics isn't going to have a ghost of a
chance against the new car dealers and real estate twits. 

&gt; It's incumbent upon you to live up to the standards of the neighborhood you 
&gt; choose to live in.  Now, before I get publically defiled for being a 
&gt; communist, let me just say that I DO love a good project, but I choose to 
&gt; keep it in my shop, not in my yard.  I would hope my neighbors would do the 
&gt; same.

I hope that _your_ community doesn't decide to change the rules in
midstream!  You might find you neighbors dictating what you can do in your
shop.  Yes, there are communities that prohibit auto mantainance in your
own garage!

George
