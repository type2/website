Subject: Re: [VB] Tires

&gt;With all the posts I went through to lookup some info on tires I can't seem
&gt;to find the answers to my questions.
&gt;
&gt;I just installed Pirellis P300 on my rims and I'm gonna take them with me to
&gt;pick up my bus. I probably won't need them there since I'm taking a trailer
&gt;but just let me know if these tires sound right. Pirelli P300; 185 70X14.
&gt;There is no load factor,  it just says  &quot;Standard Load&quot; and Max Load is at
&gt;1201 lbs _at_ 35 PSI. Now if I got my math correct pressure should be at 15 PSI
&gt;up front and 22 in the back since the back is heavier. Right? That's at
&gt;least how someone knowledgeable told me to figure my pressure.


Diameter is 6.7% too small.

One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter of
26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14

Load rating too low.

Pressure much too low.  Since they're the wrong tires, pressures are going
to be a matter of guesswork.  I'd say start with 28 ft, 35 rear.
