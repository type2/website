Subject: brm's on a big nut '59
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey there list,
Been tinkering w/ the idea of getting some brm's (from greg) for my panel.
I've got a big nut tranny in my '59 panel, 205/75/15's all around.
Will these go on without mods? Are the tires too big for the brms?
Also, what about center cap clearance. I know woody was having these 
troubles...
I guess in one sentence, what do I need to do to mount them?:)
Thanks,
Pete
