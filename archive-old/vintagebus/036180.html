&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Are the front doors the same on the '65 as on the '67?
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;  I need a '65 and have an opportunity to purchase a '67.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Rick,
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes they are.  Except for the manufacture date stamped in them!
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Didn't 65 doors use swing out handles? Or are they the same as 67 
&gt; pushbutton
&gt;  &gt; &gt; handles?
&gt;  &gt; &gt; The pushbutton handle uses 2 screws thru the door, so he would need to 
&gt; drill
&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2 holes if the 65 doors have swing handles......
&gt;  &gt; &gt; From vin # 1222026 to 216190000 handle # 211 837 205F was used.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Starting vin # 217 000 001 handle # 211 837 205K was used.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Is the only difference between these handles the key code? F being T 
&gt; code
&gt;  &gt; &gt; and K being L code?
  
  
...The 67 door handles are differnt only in that they take the 67 L series 
 key, but they fit the same as other push button handles.  So you would want 
to 
 switch over and keep your original handles, especially if you have the key 
to 
 them.
  
   I think the 64-65 push button doors are only slightly differnt than the 66-
 67 ones- only in that the 66/67s came with the stubby flipper and a pull 
 handle, and there is a place on the door for a metal doohickey for the screw 
 to hold the pull handle on the 66/67.  But, the holes for the panel clips 
 are identical, and yes they fit the same, no visble differnce with the door 
 panel on, no functional differnce at all I believe
