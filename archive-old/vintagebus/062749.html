Subject: RE: [VB] Re: High Beam relay for 67'?

If your relays are of the bosch 5 terminal type there are other makers of 
that relay that are epoxy sealed. Freightliner had problems with water 
leaking on to their relay panel in the fld120 models so they went to a 
sealed relay to eliminate water intrusion and warranty claims. Go figure.
