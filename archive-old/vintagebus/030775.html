Well. My part of Kanadia  is alot further south,, so I am out of the running..

and as your still reading 
I am at 43.19 N and 80.19 W

 Looks like there is 4 entire States further north than me!  Montana, North
Dakota,Minnesota and of course Alaska
But there are a further 11 states that are partially more northern than me,, 
If you are further north than the folowing,, 
Roseburg Oregon
Idaho Falls Idaho
Shoshoni Wyoming
Mission South Dakota
Beaver Dam Wisconsin
Saginaw Michigan
Spectacular New York
Rutland Vermont
Concord New Hamshire
Kennebunkport Maine

I need a WORLD map now!  anyone else above 43.19 deg ?

&gt; &gt; Well, I think Kanadia is farther North than Minnesota.  Vancouver, BC,
&gt; &gt; Kanadia.  Probably not the Northernmost listee, but close!

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But seriously, I'm in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, 45 degrees latitude.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Prolly not the most northern, but at least I got in first...!
