I just got my rack back from the galvanizers on Friday. The thing looks great,
although if you look closely you may see a few imperfections, i am still
pretty happy with it. I couldn't wquite remember what it looked like before,
until I saw an old photo(it was basically all red from teh rust. Now it is a
nice textured gray. happy with the results
