&gt;The only remaining problem is that the left rear taillight assembly is an 
&gt;early model and is not grounded so no action there, need to find a bay unit
&gt;to replace with and it should be fine.

The original ground was through the mounting screws which is not great
but you should be able to get it to work.  Or, turn on the left turn
signal, go to the back, and use a piece of wire to jump the reflector/
socket to ground (like the case, or one of the tin screws).  If that
starts it flashing, you can get by with just adding a ground to what
you have.  One way to do this is to crimp a male tab connector on the
end of a wire and use about a 1/2&quot; hose clamp to clamp the connector
to the bulb socket.  Ground the other end of the wire and you should
be good to go.

If improving the ground doesn't get it, check the bulb.  If it's OK,
check the wires to the left light...they run up and just over the
engine lid opening, and back down on the right side to join the ones
from the right light and go under the Bus.

Good luck!
