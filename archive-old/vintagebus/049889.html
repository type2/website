Subject: Re: [VB] Shock prefs?

&gt;I'm replacing all 4 shocks - any preferences as to which to buy? I've been
&gt;running KYB GR-2's at all four corners for about 10 years. I'm looking for
&gt;a smooooth ride, rather than a stiffer one for hauling.
&gt;
&gt;How are the Gas-Adjusts? the &quot;German&quot; shocks?



I've bought three sets of GR-2's now, one set for my '66 Westy, one for my
'68 1200 Beetle, and one set for my '88 Toyota 1 Ton truck.  I wouldn't
call GR-2's &quot;soft&quot;, except in comparison to Gas-A-Justs or Bilstiens, which
are for those who love to suffer.  The GR-2's are certainly tighter than
OEM shocks.  I bought a set of Bilstiens for a '70 Beetle once (including a
Bilstien steering damper!), and they sure did ride hard.  When I was young,
dumb, and full of c*m, I bought a set of Bilstien 'Sport Setting' for a '78
Scirocco (which was still under warranty).  The only perceptible suspension
action remaining was the deflection of the tires!  That plasticy car was
turned into a bunch of squeaks and rattles by those damn shocks.  I put a
set of Bilstien 'Comfort Setting' on a '79 Scirocco, and it was barely
tolerable.

I paid about $17 each for the Beetle GR-2's from a HVWs advertiser, and
under $20 each for the Toyota GR-2's from my local FAP store.
