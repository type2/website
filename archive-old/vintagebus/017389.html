My Friday is Thursday so I started early. I work 4x10
hours at the black helicopter factory~really, (Boeing
Helicopter AH64D/WAH64D. Tell Shawn Madison, owner of
the preacher/Urine-pean bus that I have done some
preaching in my day but I seem to be able to control
my bladder for the moment. Reverend Jim is an old
nickname~ In the '70's I used to vacillate between
volunteering for Campus Crusade for Christ and trying
to see God at Allman Brothers concerts. Was not an
uncommon trend back then...
Chem trails have been seen over Phoenix and have photo
proof. (really) Magically only happens when its really
cold and coincides with the Winter holiday travel
season. ;-) Baygen still sits by my desk. Water
barrels are still out back. Want one?, want six? Had
wheat, water, weapons, lock on the door and Art Bell
from the high desert on the Baygen but forgot to not
get my wife pregnant 3/1999. Daughter was born Jan 05
Y2k. Caused an personally isolated run on the ATMs. VW
society as I knew it kind of collapsed only to become
a real Joy on the home front. Must have been a
conspiracy or the open germination seeds that &quot;they&quot;
talked about.
Time to lay hands on the AZ Bus Club's Jerome raffle
bus this weekend. Send pmail to myself or
cal4570_at_concentric_dot_net for directions to come assist
with the effort at list member Kyle's house.
