     Eric &amp; Barb respond to break-in question with
     &quot; Check oil often, after 300 miles change engine oil, remove rocker 
     arms, retorque heads, and fully tune up the engine.&quot;
     
     The above goes against most of what I've heard in the past ten years 
     of serious VW ownership (I've owned no automobiles but T2 splitties 
     since '90) and doing my own mechanicals.  I wouldn't even bring it up 
     except that I've come to greatly value Eric &amp; Barb's advice.  
     
     I've heard two widely varied bits of advice about head torqueing when 
     breaking in motors.  
     1) Pull motor and retorque all head bolts.
     2) Don't bother retoqueing any head bolts as it's not necesaary if 
     it's done properly in the first place.  This is supposedly one of Gene 
     Berg's opinions.  
     
     I've broken in three motors in ten years on our two type 2's.  I'm a 
     paranoid kind of guy so I pulled them and retorqued all heads bolts.  
     They were all looser than torque specs so I'm glad I did it.  
     
     What I've *never* heard is to retorque only the bolts under the rocker 
     arms.  I know they're the easiest to get to but wouldn't this put 
     undue tilt to one side of the head if the hidden bolts don't get the 
     same treatment?

     PS - I'm still searching for the archives.  Can someone give the 
     address for this?
