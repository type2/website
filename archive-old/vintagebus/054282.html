Subject: Travel Route Question


I am transporting one of my VWs from the San Francisco Bay area (Benicia 
near Vallejo) to San Diego.  I can do this via either 101 or I-5.  I am 
inclined to travel 101 simply because there are more people and 
possibilities for help if I encounter any problems not fixable in the 
&quot;field&quot;.  Since this is a one way trip I have assembled a limited toolbox 
that will stay in San Diego along with a small assortment of parts and a tow 
bar just in case...  I can see me checking in at the airport with 60 pounds 
of tools and a jacket :-)   Also, gearing gives me a comfortable cruising 
speed of 50-55 mph.... you know, built for the alps kinda thing.  I am open 
to opinions on my selection and will be printing out the AIRS list for the 
drive as a fallback in any case.

This whole thing should be interesting and give me a taste of what some 
people go through on the drives spanning half a continent or more.  Driving 
is a meditative experience for me... very relaxing.

Staffan
