Subject: Transmission Side Cover Leaks
Date: Wed, 5 Jul 2000 19:04:26 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I'm gearing myself up to work on my transaxle and have a question.  So
I'll be taking my redux boxes apart to change the bearings and I also have
to change the seals under the side-covers.  What is the best way to do that?
When I loosen the side covers should I pull the tube right out and replace
the gasket and O-ring that way,  or should the whole redux box come off of
the tube ie.  both the cover and the back part that the cover screws on to.
Bently seems to imply the first method but the second method seems easier?

TIA
