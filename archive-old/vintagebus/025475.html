Hi all,

Does anyone have a parts bus out there?  I've been doing
some moderate rustoration on the wifes '67 21 window.  I
noticed some rust around the driver door gasket at the top
against the body.  After pulling the headliner fabric that
is in this area that wraps around the channel,  it turns out
the bottom of the slot that holds the top door rubber is
rusted away due to a leaking from the front skylight or
around the top of the door.  I need to find the top channel
that holds the rubber all the way across and down the front
about 5 inches.    A cut right at the body would do fine,
then I could weld it in place.  Any gracious souls out
there?  I would gladly pay you for your time and shipping.
