Let's see if I have the rules down now. If I state my &quot;personal opinion&quot;,
it's bashing, if you state yours it isn't. Simple enough. And that thing is
to Volkswagen as Tequiza is to beer.

&gt; It looks like we are starting the bashing thing again. It's all a matter
of
&gt; personal opinion. Remember Pacer? Gremlin? Pinto? People drove these
things.
&gt; Besides, it's not a Mutant Honda like you were trying to connect here,
don't
&gt; you forget it! It's a VOLKSWAGEN!
