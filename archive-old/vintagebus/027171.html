I have uncut flat wheel wells.  I'm sure it needs to have the full width seat.

&gt; ..
&gt; just to make sure- the switch to the 1/3 2/3 seat was at the same time as the wheel wells changed.   so if you have the earlier wheel wells (flat) your truck came with the full width seat, If it has the flared wheel wells, it came with the s1/3 2/3 seat.   If your rear wells were hacked, they changed the front at the same time, so you can check there.
