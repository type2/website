&gt; I have never tried insulating heater boxes since. I have thought about

&gt; it.

Hi Eric,
We buy type 3 heater boxes and install the insulation blankets off of these 
onto our type1/2 heater boxes.  Only a small cut needs to be made to the 
insulation blankets to work around the type1/2 heater cable linkage.  Noticable heat 
increasement and no noticable rasing of oil temps during hot weather.
