Subject: Classic weekend (long)/new engine 

Hey everyone,
Well, another years Classic weekend has come and gone. Back to work tomorrow
morning.

This was an interesting journey this year in the bus. I built and installed a
new engine for the deluxe just in time for the trip. Before we left friday am
I had about 120 miles on it. The new Leistritz German exhaust that Ronnie
shipped out was installed Wed evening and after a few adjustments it ran and
sounded awesome. The engine is a stock 1600dp that was balanced, has a 69mm
C/W crank, 040 heads, 34-3 carb, and a 009.
We left Concord about 6:15am and headed the backroads through Brentwood to
Tracy and jumped on 580 which quickly turned into I-5. Our first stop for gas
was in Santa Nella where Andersons Split Pea soup Restaurant is. This was
about 103 miles and at fill up it took approx 5.25 gallons. 20mpg on the first
1/2 tank fill up. From there we jumped back on I-5 South and made it right to
the bottom of the Grapevine to fill back up. This is the first fill up from
start to finish on the new engine. This was about 200 miles and took 9.5ga at
approx. 21mpg.
Luckily there was absolutely no wind any direction and about a 75 degree
outdoor temp all the way. The engine ran so cool that after 3 hours of driving
I could still grab the dipstick.
We filled up and made our way up the grapevine. We stayed in 3rd gear at 42mph
the whole way up. Once through the hills we got stuck in that damn LA traffic
and added about another hour to our trip.
Finally made it to the Crown Plaza in Irvine a little after 3pm. Not too bad 2
1/2 tanks of gas from the Bay Area to Irvine and 9hrs of driving.

Woke up early Sat am, my friend Brian met me for the ride to the Duck Pond.
Our wives were going to Disneyland for the day so it left us free to check out
lots of buses.
There were well over 350 buses in attendance. At least that's my guess.
Probably the best OCTO meet I've attended. Great people there, killer buses, a
few good deals on parts.
After that we made it to the Toy and Lit show. What a great show that is. It's
great if you want to spend a good deal of money on hard to find pieces.
The next day was the Classic and that is such a phenomenal show. I'd recommend
it to anyone on the planet. Has to be the largest show in the world. So many
of everything it's best to see the pics when posted on The Samba.
We finally left around 12:30 since we had a long day already and knew a huge
drive ahead of us.
Hit the road, filled back up with gas. This time after the LA traffic, to and
from a few shows the mileage dropped a bit, but not bad. 171 miles, 8.6
gallons, and approx 20mpg. Not bad for stop and go traffic for an hour and the
grapevine.
Did pretty much the same stops going north on I-5. Northern end of the
grapevine for gas again. 134 miles, 6.32 gallons, and approx 21mpg.
Next stop was Santa Nella for gas and dinner. 199 miles, 10gallons, and approx
20mpg.
Last stop was home about 8:45pm. Time to sleep.
This time it took about 8hrs due to missing almost all over LA trafic on the
way home.
Hope everyone that made it had as much fun as I did.
Looking forward to next years.
See everyone then.
