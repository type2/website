&gt;   It pays to
&gt; cultivate good Karma!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;

Ain't that the truth.  At Kelly park, I struck up a good conversation
with a seller.  He ended up giving me a straight rim.  Of course it was a
lowly 14, but it was free!  When was the last time someone at a swap GAVE
you something for nothing?  I must have been over due for a withdrawal at
the Bank of Karma   Either that or he just wanted to clean out his garage
cuz he was moving...like he said.  Either way, we both went home happy
:-)
