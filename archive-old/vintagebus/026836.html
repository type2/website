&gt; I have used both types of sender in my '60. The type of gauge didn't seem to
&gt; make any diff. My gauges read funky until I added a ground wire from the
&gt; sender's collar to a nice fresh hole on the body. In my case corrosion
&gt; between tank and body was the problem. As I remember mine wouldn't read
&gt; above a quarter full regardless of the position of the sender.

Thanks for input but I'm still stumped.  I know that both were grounded very well.  I just cant
explain the backwards reading though(gauge moving in reverse order of the sender)  Which one
between the sender and the gauge is easier to short out?   Would a short cause this weirdness?
I did'nt know though that there were 6v and 12v gauges cause there were not 6v and 12v senders.
Could
this be the source of my problem?   I'm just trying not to buy another gas gauge just to test
things out.  Thanks for your replies.....--JD
