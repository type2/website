Subject: RE: [VB]fuel sys mod

&gt; &gt;Found everything I needed but also found some nice little brass ball
&gt; &gt;valves for less than $10.

I like the tank/choke cable idea, definetly want a shut off at the tank (and 
would also like to be able to spell definetly), and would also like a 
bulkhead shutoff as the fuel line enters the engine compartment.
&gt;
&gt;The brass shouldn't care, but I wonder about the compatibility of the
&gt;seals in the valve with gasoline.
&gt;
That's what I'm waiting to find out, what valves would be the ones to use.  
I can check the McMaster-Carr site but I need to know what size, what 
material, what type would be best.

Also, I could check to see what types/styles of filters they have availible. 
  Basically, I want to put together'the' mac-daddy fuel system, bay tank, 
double shutoff, double filtered vibration proof.
