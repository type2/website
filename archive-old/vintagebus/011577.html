Subject: BAD DAY

when i got my bus it came without a jack - so i found one and it broke -
the shaft that pins on to the nut just snapped - so off i went to about 10
machine shops to see who could make me on - NONE could - i mean really what
is the point, seems like a simple shaft to me but..... - so i had to get
the old one repaired - not so bad i guess since it didnt cost me anything.

so i rush home to my bus :) see it sitting there with it's massive roof
dents - it's new rockers - it's five missing windows - and im kinda
cheerful - because im gonna just put the windows in and get it on the road
- ill fix the roof dents later - anyway 

so i rush home - check out my new welding - my new jack point slide the
bilstein into the brand new jack thingy - IT FOLDED :'( - ok so im a newbie
- but really i replaced both the outrigger and the jack thingy - both
welded on to solid steel - how would i know that i was supposed to put
something else in there between the outrigger and the jack thingy - shit

oh well it does seem like a fairly simple fix - just kinda sucks that i
have to do it

just wanted to whine

oh yeah - i saw a guy in my neighbourhood today driving a split window
camperized panel van :) - guess i should be happy for him - but i do hope
he does so body repairs soon - 

jdd 59 std

hey - why doesnt Jack Maynard plagarized Bob's Sermons and publish em -
just sort of change the name and the first paragraph - who would know jack 
    
hahaha (jk - lighten up already)
