use a hot air popcorn popper to roast coffee beans- it works really well


A while back someone mentioned using a hot air popcorn popper for
something - I forget what.  I tried to start my bus the other day, after it
sat for about a month during which most of the days had lows of -30 C or
less, and that bad boy just would not start, it wouldn't even turn over,  I
even had the battery inside over night to warm it before I tried to start
it.  So I recalled the mention of the hot air popcorn popper and thought I
would put it under the engine to see what happened.  We have a plug in the
driveway to plug the block heater of my wife's ch*v into so I plugged in the
popcorn popper and put it under the motor.  An hour later and my bus started
right up!

Who'd a thunk?

list is great
