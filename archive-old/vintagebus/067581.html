Subject: Re: [VB] Hinge Covers

the 64-67 passenger buses came with plastic covers over the hinges for the 
back door.  Or under them, rather.  The covers screwed to the roof.  
turquoise buses had green ones.   A few years ago hinges covers were 
reproduced (but not green afaik)

&lt;&lt; I have seen hinge covers for sale on thesamba a couple times recently.  I 
was not aware they even existed.  Does anyone know the history on these.  Are 
they for specific years, doors (high hinge)?  Were they an original accessory 
of some after market item?
