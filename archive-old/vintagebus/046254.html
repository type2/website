&lt;&lt; Luckily my 
 parents are cops because the bus has no plates, is off the books, and none 
of 
 the electrical is hooked up. The headlight buckets aren't even there. 
 Needless to say they followed me home.  &gt;&gt;

WHAT!!!! I don't even know what to say, well I know what to say, but won't.
