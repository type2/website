&lt;&lt; The bearings are here, and I will probably put them in at lunchtime
 Monday, but now I'm starting to wonder if I should have ordered the
 upper two bearings also... maybe some seals, too... Any suggestions or
 comments? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
First you are nuts to drive it in the condition you describe, and no way are 
you going to be able to replace them in an hour.  Try 2-3 hours if you know 
what you are doing without special tools.  Lastly, yes you should order the 
uppers.  If the lowers are bad the upper are at best not long behind.  If you 
only replace the lowers the uppers in thier death throws will drop chuncks 
into the new lower bearings and cause you to do the job all over again!
