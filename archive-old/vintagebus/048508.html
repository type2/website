Subject: Poppin' Fresh Trans

Made the drive out from Illinois in my '66 Westy to the OCTO/Classic with a
'rebuilt' trans and now it's starting to pop out of fourth. Ring and Pinion
sounds loud as well (started growling on my first test drive). Oil level is
fine and all bolts and mounts are tight as well. A few pros told me the
slider/hub is worn and was probably put back in during the 'rebuild'. Lots
of fine shavings on my drain plugs, too.

Anyway, I'm looking for opinions as to whether or not I should replace it
before we leave or just bungee-cord the stick for the trip home. Called a
few shops in SoCal and they do not stock bus transaxles. Can anyone
recommend a good trans rebuilder; one that replaces all relevant parts and
not just the sychros?

Thanks,
Everett Rein

'66 SO-44 Westy

PS: Temporarily posting from my brother's account here in SoCal and leaving
tomorrow or Wednesday for the trip home.
