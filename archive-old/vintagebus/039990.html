so i cut up my first bus yesterday! i now have a couple cherry intake 
louvers, a couple real nice dogs, and both wheel wells from the rear, all 
from a 67. the corners werent worth the blades to cut em off.
if you have needs let me know i will be takin the stuff to sac on the 3rd, 
but if i cant make it for some reason i can ship most parts. i am selling 
stuff cheap just so i can pay for the tools i got to take the metal.
cool
zac
