When we started this paint project, we were just intending to remove the
house paint, but the many layers of questionable quality led us down the
path to bare metal in many spots.  I am still trying to keep as much of the
original primer/paint as possible, but if I can't feather the old stuff to
the point that I can't feel it when I run my hand over it, it comes off.  As
far as the smiley sun goes, I don't mind keeping its shadow embedded under
there, as long as I can't feel/see the outline of it.


&gt; Looking really sweet so far Gene.  I like that stock color combo (white
over
&gt; blue)

Perhaps I was misleading as far as the colors go.  Only the top will be
stock. (I'm hoping to be able to match the existing interior shade for
touch-up purposes as well).  The lower part will be the same shade of
blue/green as the house paint that was on there.  Although VW Sea Blue might
be nice....

Does anyone know of a source for fake sheepskin seatcovers that slip on over
the front seats in a walk-through?  I am into those for comfort reasons, and
I can't find anything except for the re-upholstery kits.

Thanks, Gene
