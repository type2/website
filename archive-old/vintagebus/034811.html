Subject: 30 pict or 34 ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Need your advice. I am in the midst of having my 1600DP rebuilt. The guy
&gt;rebuilding it is telling me to run a 30pict with a dual port adapter
instead
&gt;of a 34 pict carb. I have the 009 set up but will upgrade with a petronix
&gt;ignitor. He tells me that I will get better gas milage with the 30 and
should
&gt;not notice any performance differences. Just want to run close to stock as 
possible. Want reliability not speed.
