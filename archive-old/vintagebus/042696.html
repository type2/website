hi clara,

I'm not sure if he did put a ground strap on or not, thats why i bring it
up... But really he has just had poor running problems since the swap,
and the tranny has the same gear ratios as his old one i think...

He has gone through everything, and his engine is pretty fresh, it just
wont run right, thats why i thought of the ground strap as a possible
culprit...

take care,

Steve
