well i managed to crack a chunk off mine with a 3 arm puller, you definately
need something flat to go under the wheel and put the pressure on the very
center part , this is why the 3 arms doesnt work , wrong angle on the ends ,
you need a 2 arm and some kind of doughnut that you can screw around the
base, i made that by drilling a big hole in a piece of wood and then cutting
it in half, and then using some bolts to bolt it under the stearing wheel, i
f you want to try just  the 3 arm you better have some super glue ready :o(

&gt; Seriously, when I posted I was just wondering if anyone had used the 3
&gt; pronger from Sears with success.
