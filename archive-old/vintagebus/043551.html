Subject: Cheap tune-up equipment

All,

Don't know if it's been mentioned before, but Actron/Sunpro has some
really cheap test equipment available on their &quot;garage sale&quot; that 
might help you tune up your Bus.

http://www.actron_dot_com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=garage.htm

Basic tach-dwell analog meter $12, fancy one $15, electronic digital
tach/dwell/volt/ohm $15, temperature adapter w/thermocouple (plugs
into DMM) for $10.

I have no affiliation with them other than as a satisfied customer.
I really like the temperature adapter and think it might be real
handy in seeing how tuning changes affect the temperature of various
things.
