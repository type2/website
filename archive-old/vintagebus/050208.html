Subject: a little bit of '59 Kombi progress

We're gonna be moving over the next week or so I've been doing a lot of
work at my new place to get it ready. The good news is that my new place is
the property where my shop and VW's are located. I was previously given
custody of the shop by a relative. She now decided she couldn't handle the
big old ranch house anymore. So she's gonna move into town and let my
family rent it indefinatly. Before now, I had been driving 5 miles to work
on my bus. I foresee much more bus work getting done in the near future!

I did squeeze in some time on my bus recently. I had to get all new screws
for my pop-out window frames. The nut &amp; bolt place found some that were
pretty close (just a tad too long) for about .13 cents a piece.  I ended up
having to grind a little bit of length off of them. I also bought a tap for
the size of those screws. So I just got a scrap piece of metal that was the
right thickness, put a tapped hole in there, and ground off what was too
long. So now all my frame halfs seem to be operational and fit together
fine. They're all pretty pitted from rust. I'm gonna try to make 'em look a
little better if I can using glazing putty before I prime again and then
paint.

I installed my rear window and all of my door rubber. I temporarily put an
extra steering wheel I had on the bus and backed it out of the shop so I
could move things around and clean up. That was the first time it's moved
under it's own power in about 1 1/2 years. After I was done I got to drive
it back in. Didn't have any brakes cause they need to be bled. Was still
inspiring though. Every little bit helps!
