Ok, is the little fiber rider on the points worn out?  Can you adjust
them to any place where they will open and close?  It could be that 
they're way too right or way too loose.  How about the cam on the
distributor?  For that matter, does the distributor turn evenly?  Does
it wobble?

&gt; engine, the points do not open and close.  I'm following the points
