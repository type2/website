&lt;&lt;  I can not for the life
 of me figure out the correct adjustment for the valves on the bus.  It
 is a 1966 deluxe with an engine number  0748317.  I can not find the
 magic letter &quot;H&quot; the would tell me to adjust at .004.  From the looks of
 Chiltons and Bentley, the settings after 1965 were at .004.  I would
 hate to set them wrong and pay the price for my mistake. Any type of
 insight would help.

Hi Mark,
The problem is that your engine could have been altered and/or rebuilt in such
a way to change this adjustment.  We suggest using a .006&quot; valve lash, if this
turns out to be .002&quot; lager than you need all it will do is run a little
noisier.  If you adjust it to tight it will burn the valves.  Eric &amp; Barb
