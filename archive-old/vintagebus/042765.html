&gt; Is it possible to install a full flow filter system on my 1600 while
&gt; it is still together?.....in the bus??  Can I drill and tap the case
&gt; with out getting metal shavings in the motor?  I'd like to put one on
&gt; my engine, but don't want to tear the motor apart again.  Its running
&gt; perfect and I don't want to tempt fate. S
Other people may disagree,

But i love filter pumps... (schadek or VW of mexico only) i have had full
flow with hoses and it seems that mine always leak.  I'm sure i could
spend big bux and get aircraft quality hoses for my full flow system, but
thats  alotta dough.

On a split the filter pump fits so i say go for it, on a bay it wont, so
you will have to go full flow with hoses on 68-71 (or any bus with an 
upright)

take care,

Steve
