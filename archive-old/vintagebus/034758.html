&lt;&lt; As it turns out, the tread had seperated on the tire but not some off.  
Once
 parked, it layed back down and everything appeared okay but the minute you
 took off, the tread started slapping the fender making the whuppa noise
 again.  The tire still held air. &gt;&gt;

The same thing happened to me in my Audi 5000, and that it just what came to 
my mind.
