shoes don't look soaked.  I think this has been an ongoing slow leak, there 
wasn't any actual liquid (brake fluid), more like an accumulation of dampness 
and crud.  So ya, the shoes have some of this black crud on them in a couple 
places... Do I need to
 replace them?  &gt;&gt;

If they are not worn much you might just want to spray them with Brakleen 
brake shoe cleaner.  Just make sure to use this stuff outside over some 
newspaper, and to hang the shoes one at a time from a wire (Coat hanger works 
well!) away from any painted parts of your VW.  This stuff will strip the 
oils out of your skin and it will begin to peel and crack nastily.
 
 &lt;&lt; I can't see any sign of pits or grooves.  So I'm wondering about this 
rebuild kit idea.  Is this a VW-specific part or something generic?  The 
VWflaps in my area don't seem to carry them, at least they don't show up on 
the websites. (bow-wow and Cal Imports)  What does it contain exactly?  Is it 
just new rubber rings?  &gt;&gt;

Each kit will come with the needed ring seal/s and dust cover/s.  You can get 
them from NAPA down here in Washington, but the cost is just about high 
enough to equal on of the rear cylinders, but less than one of the front 
cylinders.  We have seen some places on the internet having rebuild kits for 
as less as $10.00.  The front rebuild kit/s you need are the same size from 
55-67.  While you have the brake system apart do take the other cylinders 
apart to check for pits/rust where the ring seals ride back and forth (Do not 
mix parts from one to the other!), and check the ring seals for any cracking. 
 Polish the bores of each cylinder with fine (300-400 wet/dry sand paper work 
really well!) sandpaper.  Remove the brake shoe adjusting stars to clean, 
regrease them so they will adjust properly for the next up to 30,000 miles 
without freezing up with corrosion.  When reinstalling the brake adjusting 
stars make sure that they are adjusted all the way in, and next time back off 
these adjusting stars before pulling the drums!
  Lastly replace your single circuit brake master cylinder with a 72 and 
later bus MC that is dual circuit!  See the type 2 library for our article on 
this conversion which with a new MC and a few parts from local wrecking 
yards, total cost about $50.00 and two hours working on the bus to complete.  
This way in the future if one of the wheel (Slave) cylinders, flex or the 
hard lines, or something else in the brake system goes bad you will have 
about half your brakes still working instead of the panic you just went 
through!  Also check your brake fluid reseviour much more often for dropping 
fluid level and especially if the brake pedal is noticably changed 
feel/postion!   Eric&amp;Barb
