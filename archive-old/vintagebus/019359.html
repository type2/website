The other day I got the Westy's wiper motor working.  It wouldn't work
initially because the wiper shafts were rusted too badly.  I smacked them both
with a hammer to free them up and the motor groaned into action, really 
s-l-o-w at first, gradually picking up speed as it polished the worst rust off.

I greased the pivot points and oiled the very rusty shafts (which I will 
replace) but the motor is LOUD.  Like a little vacuum cleaner under the dash.
I dug in the archives this afternoon and found some information on cleaning up
the older pre-'65 wiper motors.  From that it seems I should disassemble stuff
until I find some gears, and grease those.  And I should polish and lubricate
the armature shaft.  But I've never had one apart before...it's out of the bus 
so I can replace those shafts.  And I understand the design changed drastically
in '65.  Can anybody who has had one of these give me a little warning as to 
what I should expect upon opening this up?  It's a 12V '67 Bus wiper motor.

I _did_ get the speedo out of the dash today too.  Took a hammer to it
(gently).  The petrified rubber seal had quite a grip on it.  It took more than
a moderate tap to free it!  After disassembling it and three other speedos I
have, I think I have three original discs I can shift over and use for the 
lights.  I will have to find something to use for the turn signal indicator,
but with all the great help from the list I think I've got a good chance of
that :-)  Thanks.
