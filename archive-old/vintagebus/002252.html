Have you eaten?

I was looking through BH's sermon's page
http://osf02.ktu_dot_edu.tr/~ulutas/hoover/roof_rack.html and came across the
roof rack section. His rack sounds like an interesting weekend project, but
I think he forgets to mention a key detail..re: stantion design.
He does mention using electrical conduit for the frame...easy to picture
using various 90 degrees and T's, but the stantions are the real concern.
Here's a portion of the sermon:
&quot;&quot;&quot;The rack is as long as the vehicle and nearly as wide. It is supported on
eight legs, fastened to the drip rail with a tricky little bolted clip
incorporating a brass shoe that allows the drip rail to continue railing
drips yet prevents rust at the point of contact. The rack is made from
electrical conduit and weighs about forty pounds.&quot;&quot;&quot;
Does anyone have a good design for a home made stantion?
I read E&amp;B's post on early beetle fuel tank clamps...but I'm wondering how
this would attach to a steel tube basket rack with no legs to rest in the
rain gutter?


sincerely,


Tom
