&lt;&lt; Sunroof (And dormobile?) and double door busses came with &quot;belly pans&quot; for 
 extra structural integrity. Just like little skid plates welded to the 
bottom.
 You no longer have a view of the frame in the center of the bus.
  &gt;&gt;
Only some dormobiles (not mine) came with sub floors, I am under the 
impression(not the same as facts) that it was only dormobiles that where 
buiilt on sun roof busses that commonly had them. Also I --think-- you could 
order them on other types of buses. there was a thread on the list a little 
while back about this. some one had a pop top westy with a sub floor?
