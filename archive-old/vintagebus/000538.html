&lt;&lt;I saw one myself in my recent travels.  I just have to find out if it is 
for sale.  I have always wanted one.  Actually, I want the one for a bus with 
belly pans.  This one was on a 61 turquoise standard walkthrough if I 
remember right.  Como green interior and bullet lights... pretty cool.  
Actually, it might have been the other turquoise one that was the walk 
through.
