Hey,

I live in Fullerton about 1/4 mile from Lenny's.  I know of a &quot;VW&quot; house that is
chock full of, lets say people of questionable ethics.  It would be the first
place I'd check out if a VW of mine were stolen.  BTW its only down the street
from WCC.  It is located just South of Fullerton Community  College.

I asked someone in the local VW community about them and their response was
&quot;well, I wouldn't associate with them&quot;.  Good enough for me.

Steve
