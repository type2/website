&gt;&gt;On my '59 there are two pull knobs on either side of the heater knob.  One is for the manual choke, what is the other for?  I see the cable coming out in the engine/trans area but don't know where to hook it up.  Could it be for a gas tank reserve since it has no gas gauge?
&gt;&gt;
You mean no one wrote what they were next to the switches in ink or put some sort of sticker there?  How strange!

Yes, it's the gas tank reserve.  Wolfsburg West has the reserve switches, if yours is missing.

I'm jealous of you with your newfangled reserve cable, I have to get out and open the engine compartment to switch over.  ;)

Good luck,
