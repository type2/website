&lt;&lt; Hello
 
 I'm thinking on replaceing my manual gearbox with a automatic.
 
 The Seller gave me this number : 001.301.211
 Will it fit into my 1500 (44 hp) with this number : H1029746

they did use auto tarns in bugs.  starting in 69 it was available.  These are 
IRS, meaning a whole different axle configuration than the swing axle bus.  
Also you have a wierd oil pump that pumps stuff for the auto trans.

I have driven an auto trans bug a few times, but cannot say I would ever be 
tempted to do this to a bus.  However, it could be done, though it would be 
more work than a straightforward tranny swap, if you really want it 
automatic.
