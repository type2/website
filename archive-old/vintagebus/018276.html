Subject: Puck luck and lost...
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Back in 1997 or 98 my wife and I spotted a Puck from a
freeway in Southern California.  We immediately
tracked down the name of the tow-truck company and
owner of the impound yard. The little caravan looked
to be in workable order albeit the main window was
missing. The impossible to find hub caps were laying
adjacent and in plain sight. We suspected that it
needed more attention than we were willing to give it
at the time. Coupled with a lack of cooperation from
the yard owner we moved on to other adventures.
Life got busy and we never acted on the information
but kept it in the back of our minds. 

Recently, I gave the location information to two
fellow bus freaks who were anxious to acquire a Puck.
We already had a Puck at home so we thought it right
in this buy and sell world to spread the wealth. (Can
you tell the extent of the VW burn out that I'm going
through?)
I never heard of any real action taken by one of the
two guys but the other one was all over it. Today,
word was received indicating that the yardman informed
him that &quot;the little old white trailer had sat there
for ten years with no interest shown towards it.&quot;
Here's the kick in the trousers- It was *given* away
only last month to a local official good ole boy buddy
who wanted something a little smaller than their
larger RV. 
Drats! Perhaps next time... =)

A photo of the Puck sitting in the impound yard has
been posted to the VWPlanet Gallery &lt;49-67 Campers&gt;
for lack of better place to put it...
