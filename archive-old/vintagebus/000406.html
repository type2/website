Hi Scott,
Definitely a possibilty, but he also states that he has no running lights, 
but has turn signals.  If this is true of especially the tail lights then 
this would mean that the running lights were also not getting electricity 
from the headlight switch.  If the turn signals in the tail lights are 
working, and since they use the same ground as the running lights in the tail 
lights.   Thusly most likely the headlights are probably not working for the 
same reason.    Eric&amp;Barb
