Judy, et al

After I drove home from work  on Monday I parked the bus in the yard until I
had some time to spend with it. Fortunately our lawnmower broke and I was
able to abandon yardwork in favor of bus tinkering. Since the bus was 5
months past due on the safety inspection I decided to get that stuff sorted
out. 

First in line was the broken passenger side windsheiold wiper pivot. I
lowered the parcel tray and examined the situation. It turned out to be a
fairly easy repoir. I just compared the working driver side setup to the out
of order passenger side. The spare pivot that came with the bus was a
perfect fit. The hardest part was removing the circlip the holds the pivot
to the motor arm. It finally popped it off with a snall screwdriver without
any real problem. Getting the little bugger back on was a lot tougher and I
ended up losing in somewhere in the ether. Have to find a replacement. 

The second order of business was the non working left rear brake/parking
light/turnsignal light. A little jiggling of wires and a new buld solved
that problem for now. I will go back and redo all the connections when the
motor comes out next week. 

For some odd reason the right front turnsignal works but does not come on
with emergency flasher switch. I will need to have a look at that relay
soon. 

I decided that as long as the inspection station did not demand to drive the
bus or look too closely at the tires I could prolly pass the state
inspection so I put Stella's cars seat in the bus and off we went.  Except
for some confusion by the inspector about engaging the highbeams all went
well and the bus got its sticker.

Todays  festivities surrounded the securing of the middle seat into the bus
and installing at least one set of seatbelts for Frank's car seat. The bus
is equipped with mounting points for seatblets in the middle and rear seats.
I assumed they had beed chucked long ago but now I dont think so. All the
mounting holes still had nice shiny black bolts and washers in them. I also
had to cut the floor mat for the belts so pass thru. This was easy as VW had
had cast perfs into the underside of the floormat. I would REALLY like to
find some of the correct lapbelts to go back there. The fronts are a
herringbone bronze nylon with the Wolfsburg emblem on the buckle. So if
anyone out there has a set they wanna let go of......I removed a set of
belts from the '69 (which is trying so hard not to become a parts bus:) and
dug up the seat mounting hardware leftover from the '72s camper conversion
and the and all is now in order for family travel.

The bus is now legal but I am gonna do some more work before it becomes a
daily driver. I plan on yanking the motor so that I can clean it and replace
the fuel lines. Might torque the heads. Also will check clutch etc. Also
will do all the fiuids, tranny, rgd, steering box, grease the serveral dozen
fittings on the front beam, do the brakes and see about adjusting the
steering box. Dont know much about that but I need to learn so.........

I need to get in touch the Mark and see if he has the extra set of deluxe
trim and the middle seat side kick panel. ( Are you out there Mark? :)

All in all the '67 is a really cool bus and I couldn't be happier with it.
Hey, even the S.O. said it was cool and that is saying a lot!

Bentley should arrive in the mail this week and I need to order some parts
but we are off to a good start and am excited about the journey.
