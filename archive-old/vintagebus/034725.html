&lt;&lt; I have located some solid bumpers w/overriders from a listy and he is too
 far away from me to pick up convienently.  I have 2 good shape bumpers that
 are longer on top that look sorta like \_______/!!! w/out overriders, but
 made for overriders. I was hoping to just buy the overriders!  My bus is a
 66 and I would like to know that the overriders will fit even if they are
 from one of the rounder styles (67??) bumpers, if not I will buy the whole
 thing.  Sorry for my ignorance.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Patrick,
Yes the overriders and tubes will fit all the 1959-67 bus bumpers.  FYI the
1959 bumpers were used up to 1964, then the rear changed to the later rounded
pointed style.  While the front stayed the earlier slash ended style till late
July 1965 when it was replaced with the rounded pointed end style for the 1966
production year.  Then this rounded pointed tip style bumpers were continued
to the end of the 1967 production.   Eric &amp; Barb
