yes, it does have sun visors. They are almost certainly the originals. I'm the second owner of record and probably the second driver of this bus, though it changed hands at least once (maybe twice) in between. For all intents and purposes, I'm the only one who ever worked on this bus (I pulled the original axle boots off). Oh, there was that VWoA rebuild in there, but I'm talking about owners (people who would switch things around). 

It has a very good bluwies interior, complete with slightly green headliner in golly-gee condition (two very small tears).

Thanks! JOe

&gt;Well, I have a '64 green and white standard with pleated seats and no rear
&gt;view...never had one. Original interior.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Does it have sunvisors?
&gt;
&gt;I can confirm that all of my Commercials have never had a [factory] rear
&gt;view mirror.
