Subject: RE: [VB] The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em

Why would anybody want to sacrifice quality when it
comes to brakes!  

Sorry, Ron, but the first thing I do when I get a bus,
is the brakes, and I ALWAYS buy the best available. 
There is NO excuse for settling for less than the best
when it comes to the safety of me and mine (and the
other guy).  I'm sorry, but brakes are the one system
that I refuse to compromise on, and I don't want to be
on the same road with those that do!
