Subject: rear shocks

Well I just had my bus up on a lift...too cold to do my own work this time
of year, and I had my mechanic working on it.

We noticed that the rear driver side shock was rusted very bad. So time for
new shocks. 

I thought I had saved some info that had been passed around recently on
shocks...but can't find it. I checked archives-and it seems as though
oil-filled will give the smoothest ride, but gas filled are more responsive.

I'm interested in a smooth ride-so I'm thinking oil filled. I generally
never go off road...although I've been known to hit a pothole every now and
then(the streets around here are pretty rough).  

What shocks do you guys recommend? 

It looks like Boge is OE, but Bus Depot has this oil filled TUV
approved(whatever that means) Alko shock they claim is their 'best value'.
Anyone got any feedback on this shock?

Thanks,

-kevin
