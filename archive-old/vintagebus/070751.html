Subject: RE: [VB] Empi Wheel

Hi Sean,

Somewhere between 100 and 500.... several things affect the cost:

- has it been restored?  If so, take dollars away
- is the horn button original?
- if it hasn't been restored, is there a crack at 12 oclock. (these vdm
wheels are notorious to crack there...)
- is the wheel complete (i.e. all horn parts, wires, original screws,
etc)


so, with that in mind, if the wheel is in original condition, I'd say
300-500.  


... I could be interested in that wheel if it's yours, pmail me.

Sean asked:
Anybody know what these wheels are selling for these days?
