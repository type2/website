Subject: paint and body in L.A. area

Hi:

New to list.

I am in buying an original paint Kombi in Van Nuys. I would like to 
have the bus's exterior paint and body done before shipping her back 
home to Texas. There is no rust, but there are dents. Want to keep it 
original color (pearl white).

WCCR is a gold standard, but don't know if Lenny would take it on.

Can the locals on the list give recommendations based on QUALITY of 
work. Caveats?

Thanks in advance,

Mark
