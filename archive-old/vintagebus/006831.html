If you have repo U S A or the Taiwan lens it doesn't matter what wattage
bulb you have the lens will melt, how do I know, well I finally fixed my
dome lights while I camped at the Classic, all I had handy were a set of WCM
repop lens, cool I thought, got every thing working, popped on the repop
lens, left the lights on, went out to light the BBQ, went back in the bus
smelled funny,looked at my lights and low and behold the lens were bubbling,
s#it I thought, dug through my swap stuff, found some NOS German onespopped
one and and no melting, I didn't want to leave these on so i found Mark
Adair and bought some of his German repops, no melt, are exact repops of
originals and same material, He told me he gets them from the same place
that made the originals! About 10 bucks a piece though.

ronnie  old volks of az

12W?   Tell me Thom ( can I call you Thom?)  how long does it take for the 
plastic covers to melt?

the bulbs in the back roof light in my 65 are colored (greeny blue) and
since 
they are 10W I did not put the cover on it.

Have seen bulbs both longer and shorter that the regular bulbs for buses.  
The bay windows use longer bulbs.  But the right size 12V 5W bulbs are out 
there.  sometimes available at VW shows.  Pick up a couple spares when you 
find some.

 You bring up an interesting point, Clara (can I call you Clara?)
 
 I bought a whole bunch of bulbs for the panel, as I have 6 dome lights
 in it total.  All of the new 12v ones are longer than the originals,
 and I think they're 12w.  They are *very* bright, and get *very* hot -
 do I have the wrong bulbs?

 &gt; same from mid 55 (somewhat post barndoor) through 67- the aluminium bulb 
 &gt; holder - and takes the same plastic cover with which you must use 5W bulb

of 
 &gt; the same voltage as your system because other wise the covers get melted.
