&lt;&lt;I know its not Friday, but I am going to rant anyway&gt;&gt;
I was thinking about VWoA and this legal 'witchhunt' they are on this
morning, and something sorta weird hit me as I read the canned reponse from
their legal department.
VW is currently making a ton of money with the introduction of the new b*g
and other vehicle styes (into the market) that for the most part were
discontinued 25 or so years ago.  One of the primary reasons that this
reintroduction has been so successful is the nostalgia factor for the
baby-boomers (myself included).  There is not anybody out there in the over
30 age group  that cant remember (with a smile on their face) a pleasant
memory about VWs when they were growing up.
In short, they are preying on individual good feelings, and turning past
memories into dollars at their dealerships ((in the end its all about money;
it makes the world go around, and I am good with that)).
VWoA does in fact have the right to protect their trademark, which I (and I
hope everybody out there does) understand.  But it just seems to me that by
going out there and knocking down individual web sites (where for example
John Doe prowdly posts pictures of his '67 microbus that he plays with at
night and on the weekend) is nothing short of choking the very nostalgia
factor that the marketing guys are exploiting in the first place.

To me its like cutting off your foot to take care of an in-grown toenail;
you will never have a toenail problem again, but walking down the street
could be a challenge going forward.

go figure
