Hello All, Today I was looking through my parts for some 15&quot; rims, I have
one that I'm pretty sure is for a bus, but does not (and never did) have
hubcap clips, but instead has three &quot;notches&quot; that would hold a hubcap on.
The rim is wider than a Beetle rim, and has the same &quot;slots&quot; like a bus
rim....
Any ideas??
