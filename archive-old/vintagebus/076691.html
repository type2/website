67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)

&gt;   We got to see the remains of a swing axle tranny that a friend of our's
&gt; broke when he tromped on the gas to show off his newly installed type 4, 2
liter
&gt; engine in his split screen bus.  The rear wheels popped the rear of the
bus
&gt; slightly into the air and when it came back down the high RPMing tires bit
into
&gt; the pavement.  The torque energy was so much the R&amp;P pushed the tranny
case
&gt; apart left to right just forward of the axle tubes!
