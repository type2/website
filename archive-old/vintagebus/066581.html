Subject: RE: [VB] Transport Companies

&gt; So this means that even if I pay them extra $200.00 I might not
&gt; see the Bus and my money at all?


Why don't you tell him you'll pay the additional $200 in cash,
collect-on-delivery?  This protects both of you; you don't get the bus
unless he gets the extra $200, but he doesn't get the extra $200 until he
delivers the bus. (Also, make sure to spell out how soon you expect to
receive it for the extra $200.)
