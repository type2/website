  Emissions   Test Exemption for Collectible Vehicles 15-Years Old and
  Older

This is just a step in the right direction.  I have been working on this in
meetings for over 4 years --- we finally MIGHT have a chance to ease up on
the restrictions on older vehicles.  This is NO SLAM DUNK   we need help
from everyone.  Many Collectible Insurance places have 2500 mile limits  I
can even drive my Three VWS just for pleasure  Shop around  1st the 15
rolling year  sounds good to me  If not good for you then do something about
it  Get involved--as many of us have

of course, the big problem is this:

&gt;
&gt;     b.. H.B. 2357 provides for an emissions inspection exemption for
&gt;collectible vehicles for which the owner holds appropriate insurance
&gt;coverage.

most collectible insurance means NO DRIVING EXCEPT TO/IN PARADES!  so
much for your daily driver.
and i have no confidence that this isn't a  back door to eliminating
exemptions for any car EXCEPT designated collectibles.

plus, who gets to define collectible - pacers are now desirable of
all things (to a SMALL fanbase); but i bet they won't be officially
sanctioned.

frankly, a straight 25-year rolling exemption w/ a proviso that it
meets standards of the day (proper or EQUIVALENT smog equipment) is
the only logical way. which, since the ACTUAL goal is to force you to
buy a newer car, NOT reduce pollution, means it will never
happen...................
