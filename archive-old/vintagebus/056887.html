&gt; What are the reasons/causes and how can we be proactive in preventing our
&gt; chariots from catching fire?

Hi Charles,
Here are the reasons:
1.  Not replacing all flexable fuel lines with good quality German cloth 
covered hose material.  This must be replaced every two to three years or 
whenever you see cracking of the rubber at the ends!!!!  We have seen other 
fuel line start to crack in less than six months.

2.  Not maintaining a hard rubber grommet where the metal fuel line goes 
through the foward engine tin.  This allows the tin to saw through the metal 
fuel line.  We have not been able to find a good off the shelf replacement 
grommet that will last more than a week, so we use a two inch section of 
flexable fuel line slit down its length and hose clamped into place through 
the tin hole with slit upward.

3.  The brass tubing pressed into the carb fuel inlet and the fuel pump 
outlet and non-threaded inlet models loosen and pop out.  Center punching the 
body of the carb/fuel pump around these tubes helps greatly to keep these in 
a press fit.

4.  Even the best kept automobile must have a fire extingusher of at least a 
minimum of eight pounds.  The smaller ones are a joke!  The dry chemical ones 
of these must be turned over once a month and you must here a sandy movement 
heard/felt inside each time you do this.  If not the dry chemical will 
clump/cake up and all one will have is a air blaster canister.

5.  Not having the complete fuel system in place or badly worn or set.  IE 
without a gas cap you are going to have a bomb when the tank get enough 
air/fuel mixture into it when not full!

6.  Good idea to install a pre-1961 reserve switch under the gas tank in 
buses at least at late as 1971 even if you are not going to install a reserve 
cable.  This allows you to have a reserve gallon of fuel you can switch to.  
Though without a cable you will have to slide underneath your bus and switch 
it by hand.  You can also switch it to a closed postion so when you are 
replacing those flexable fuel lines one does not have to worry about fuel 
leakage if they do not empty the fuel tank first.  We know of at least two 
seperate folks who got fuel spilling and caused a spark to burn the 
automobile, garage, and themselfs badly.  One of these fellows dragged a 
steel drain pan over to get it under the leak, on a cement floor which caused 
a spark..............

7.  Install hose clamps on at least all connection between the fuel pump and 
carburetor.  Fuel pressure in this area can cause the fuel line to pop off.
