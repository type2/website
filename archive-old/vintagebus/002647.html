I, too, got my 12 turn signal relay conversion from Ronnie who in turn got
it from Kymco.  The install was rather painless - taking about an hour of my
time with a stock, never before botched harness.  I took my time and did it
right.  I've had some occasional funky operation of the hazard lights but I
think it's due to a bad ground in the switch itself or some other hooplah of
sorts.

Bottom line - it's easy, ain't cheap, could be done cheaper with off the
shelf parts, but what are ya gonna do?
