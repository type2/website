a couple of years ago, a good friend of mine (thanks
jim), introduced me to a thread file. it is a file, as
the name implies, that is square in shape and about 12
inches long. (fits in the tool box great!) each end
has four sets of teeth at different pitches, used to
clean the threads on a bolt.  i paid $6.00 for my
metric thread file from a high quality tool store. as
you use it like a file, the direction of threads does
not matter. i needed to fix my left side also. good
luck,
jayw
