&gt; I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of
bay-window
&gt; pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area

Anyway you look at it ,your site is great !!!
If I were you, I'd at least consider the upright motored bays.
If you had a seperate section I don't think it will take away from the
site. imho.

    ps.
you have a bay area in your site ??
