Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Westy interior light lenses

I have a late 67 Westy US delivered Florida to be exact. It has the 3
holes in the front of the lense. 2 are for the mounting screws the 3rd for
the light switch.

Suggestion to the person looking to make the repros. Perhaps you should
consider making the little white plastic bezel nut that holds the switch
to the lense. I have an extra I can provide should you be interested. I
have noticed these are missing most of the time and metal nuts are
generally used as replacements.
