&gt;once its half way through. but when it comes to lowering, thats 
&quot;ruining&quot; a
&gt;bus?? i think not...my bus is lowered WITH IRS suspension, the road 
handling
&gt;is incredible and i DONT have bearing problems,as ive driven this bus 
all over

Are you saying you lowered you bus by using IRS or lowering in 
conjunction with IRS?

An IRS system does give better cornering, and road handling, most of the 
time. However, the reduction boxes and swing axles really can out 
perform an IRS under certain conditons.
I suppose I could never complain about someone putting IRS on the bus 
they want to use regularly if that is what they are most comfortable 
with. I have never liked lowering, but who can say that a daily driver, 
not too rare bus wouldn't be better off with some modifications such as 
a dual cylinder brake system, new seat belts, etc. Safety first on our 
daily drivers for sure.
If you enjoy the ride, and you aren't cutting a gem into a rough stone, 
what the hell?
Jason
