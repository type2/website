Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Problem?

Aw crap...I wish someone would have posted that event.
 I found out about it this morning at a restaurant
near Lone Rock, WI when a guy was admiring my 66
Deluxe Beetle and told me about the wonderful show
that he had seen in Madison (or was it Middleton).  I
was a half hour west of there and never knew about it.
 

I have the same beetle and have changed the voltage
regualtor a couple of times.  Be sure to check the
generator output as well.  If that doesnt work than I
guess you have a short or bad ground but my guess is
to go with the regulator.

&gt; I'm having a problem with my son's 66 type 1. We
&gt; both took our VW's to
&gt; Madison Wisconsin today for a show at the local VW
&gt; dealer. I drove my 66
&gt; Westfalia and he drove his 66 1300 deluxe sedan.When
&gt; we left this morning
&gt; his engine would barely turn over, the battery
&gt; seemed weak or poorly
&gt; connected. We drove the 100 plus miles to Madison in
&gt; daylight and the car
&gt; started fine four or five times through the course
&gt; of the day. We drove home
&gt; tonight through some rain and the headlights were on
&gt; for most of the way.
&gt; When he went out to start it an hour or so after we
&gt; arrived home, once again
&gt; the battery appeared too weak to turn the engine
&gt; over.
&gt; It was great to see his sedan in the rearview mirror
&gt; and he really enjoyed
&gt; following my bus up to Madison and back, we got lots
&gt; of waves and smiles
&gt; from other drivers and kids on the sidewalk. We are
&gt; planning a longer trip
&gt; over Labor Day weekend but I want to get a handle on
&gt; this problem first.
&gt; Does this sound familiar to anyone?
&gt; T.I.A.
