&gt; the next suprise was that it came with an electronic ignition setup.
cool
me
&gt; thinks. but we never could get it running right and ended up yanking
it
out
&gt; and putting a plain jane 009 with a blue coil and a bocar 34pict carb.
it
&gt; came with a strange bocar carb with a lot of vacuum ports we couldn't
find a
&gt; use for. the electric ignition setup does look cool. vw emblems on
&gt; everything :-)
&gt;
&gt; miguel from beetlemex (very nice and helpful guy) told us that the
turn
keys
&gt; were intended for fuel injection and mebbe this was the cause for our
probs.
&gt; anyway, the engine's in and running ok.
