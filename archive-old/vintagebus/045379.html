&lt;&lt; Also, since this will primarily be a 3 season vehicle (driven seldom, if
ever below 40 degrees) for me is the thermostat totally &quot;necessary&quot;?  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Unless you are going to drive in 80+F temps at all times the thermostat really
is important.   Eric &amp; Barb

at  40 to 50 degrees, which is about what we get here these days,    There is
noticable thermostat icing soon upon start up until the engine warms enough
for the preheat to eliminate that.    Thermostats make the engine warm faster.
Carb icing makes the bus run funky till it goes away.  (upon warm up if things
are hooked up right)   I started my 61 yesterday (stored for the winter) and
it ran rough upon start up, check the engine, yes preheat hooked up, carb
icing.   Thermostat installed.  Soon, all is smooth and the beautiful music of
a vw motor fills the air, (positively makes me feel like x mas shopping.)
These days I have the heat on.   And the heat into the cab is noticably better
with a thermostat than without, from the creature comfort point of view.   

but, yes you can run it without them.      If you are building something, I
recommend installing the old thermostat.
