&lt;&lt;Is there some special tool used to get this cap off?&gt;&gt;

Trevor, VW did have a special tool to remove the center dust cover on
the brake drum.  It kind of looked like a &quot;catsclaw&quot; pry bar with
another claw that slid along the shank of the pry bar. 
 I¯¯J ¯¯¯¯    Hope this little diagram helps.

I just use my 12&quot; inch cresent wrench as a pry. Just open the span all
the way open and use the main part of the cresent to pry a little around
the base till it pops off.

&lt;&lt;Unfortunately the cap is too round &amp; smoothto grip with anything to
rotate it.&gt;&gt;

Another way (a lot more destructive) take a ball-ping hammer and flatten
two of the sides so you can get channel locks on (without them slipping
off the cap) and wiggle it off.

Remember to pack your bearings with a fresh coat of axel grease.
