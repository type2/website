Subject: My rear saved by Zip Ties

I was at a stop light this afternoon on the way to my daughter's swim meet when
disaster struck.  I put the DC in gear and the linkage came loose.  Figuring that
it had popped out, I got the truck pushed over to the side, rolled out my
&quot;emergency repair mat&quot;, slid under the DC and found that the rear shift coupler
had exploded into two pieces.  Everything was still there, but wire would not hold
it together to allow shifting.  I cut the wire off and aligned everything and
tried to figure out what I could do to make it operational.  I hit on the idea of
using some of the zip ties in the tool box.  One that went between the two set
bolts to hold everything together and then a half dozed wrapped around the
circumference of the coupler to hold the first one in place.  Ended up working
like a charm and I made it to the swim meet ON TIME and back without further
incident.

On the way to the meet, I was a little apprehensive about the quality of the
quickie repair, so I left it in third all the way.  Light DC + the 2L type IV =
amazing lugging power when needed.  On the way back, I gingerly went through the
gears like normal and it worked fine.

Question:  The coupler that was down there was red urethane.  Why aren't they made
out of metal?  Does that much vibration get absorbed by the non-metal couplers?

Looks like I'll be out coupler shopping in the morning.

Scott
