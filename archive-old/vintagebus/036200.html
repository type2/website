Hi Shawn,
It might just work, but if it does not do you really want to take the risk?  
Best to take a look at our article in the type 2 library on how to install a 
dual circuit master cylinder in pre-1968 buses.  Cost is about $50.00 or less 
and results in a system that if a flex or metal brake line or even a wheel 
cylinder blows out you still will have half of your brakes to control your 
forward motion instead of no brakes at all!
