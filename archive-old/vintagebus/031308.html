Subject: VW North West bus concours 12/08/01 gets once famous person as judge 
 (UK)

Don't forget to enter your shiny, bus in the Concours at VW North West
at Tatton Park, Cheshire.

You can even do it online at  www.vwnw.co_dot_uk

I'll be coming out of retirement and turning down daytime TV appearances
on cheap game shows to judge the air-cooled buses and I'll be looking
for originality and perfection and I know there are plenty of buses out
there which come up to the standard.

Bribes accepted at the cider filled, half shiny 15 window somewhere at
BugJam.
