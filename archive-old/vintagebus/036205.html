Hi all-

My buddy Billy has done it again.  As a delivery man, he travels throughout
northern california and does nothing be keep his eyes open and mouth going
looking for splits.   He had located a good portion of the 20+ splitties that
I have rescued this last two years.   Apparently by word of mouth he got
connected with an old vinyard operator near San Fransisco.  He was told this
man had a lot of old cars including vw's.   Taking a chance, he goes to the
vinyard and meets up with the man after the wife rings a big bell to bring him
out of the vinyard.  In his &quot;hothouse??&quot; there are three split windows amongst
some 135 other cars  in the hothouse and scattered about from generations of
collecting.  I guess this man has my luck and has got an order to move out
some cars.  He cut a $150 deal for a '62 Westy Kamper with original safaries,
tent and roofrack that was at the back of this hothouse.  Apparently this
hothouse was meant to dry out grapes or something or another and it left the
westy in perfect shape.  No rust, all in excellent shape.  Now thats what I
call a garage!   The other two splits were also supposed be in equal shape.
He didnt go after them at that time as he was so excited (and hot).  He called
back a couple of days later after things slowed down for him and they were
sold to another guy  :(   for $100 each.  Last week he also managed to find
some odd and ends for other split window busses or parts busses and also a
split window bug. I guess the moral of this story is there are lots of splits
out there, you just got to look and ask!  Happy hunting!
