&lt;&lt; I searched the archives... didnt come up with anything. So..... On the tie 
rods, why were there two types, adjustable &amp; non? Witch one is the best? I 
have 2 front ends off early T1s (late '50, early '60) in good shape (both are 
adjustable), will the tie rods interchange? I realize we'll have to do some 
mods, but will they fit in the knuckle correctly? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Best to replace your bus tie rods with bus tie rods.  The type 1s use 
differant angles, thinner tubing, and modifying them could easily result in a 
steering problem at speed.

&lt;&lt;Clutch adjust... this will be an easy one:) The PO took off the adjuster on 
the cable _at_ the trans, it now sports a 13mm nut w/ a big washer. Did the 
adjuster originally look like all T1s with the wing nut look? &gt;&gt;
Originally your bus should have come with the hex nut with the tapered end 
against the clutch cable arm.  What you need to figure out is not only which 
of four arms that could have been installed there, but also if the arm is 
correct for the tranny side plate that holds, and aims the end of the boden 
tube properly.  The rear end of the boden tube must be pointed at the center 
of the loop in the clutch cable arm, or the clutch cable gets to wear out 
much, much sooner on the side of the tip of the boden tube!  We even have 
seen not only the end of the boden tube cut over time by multiple cable, but 
the arm of the side plate get completely cut through also!  Round loop in the 
clutch cable arm used in two of the early types has same length and uses same 
side plate, and had the tapered nut to adjust the cable.  The two loop arms 
with a diamond shape loop used the wing nut, and both use completely 
differant side plates not only to each other due to thier differant lengths, 
but differant from the earlier style of side plate used with the round loops.
  And you said this would be easy!  Eric&amp;Barb
