Subject: HELP ME!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all...recently I have experienced the &quot;I don't have time to help you&quot; 
ordeal.  I have been trying to get new suspension installed on my 67 kombi.  
Unfortunatly the mechanic I have been patiently waiting for finally told me 
that he was not going to have time to work on my bus.  So I have been 
frantically trying to find someone else to help me.  As my luck would have 
it, the Kelley Park VW show is 2 weeks away and all VW repair shops are 
booked until May.  So my only alternative is to do it myself!!  I feel 
pathetic being 22 years old and having 8 years of VW history under my belt 
and totally lacking the knowledge of how to fix anything myself, not to 
mention that I am a girl.  So would somebody...anybody offer me some advice 
on how to get started and exactly what to do in order to fix my front 
suspension!!!
Thanks,
Phoenix
