Subject: 66 walkthrough camper

I am working on a 66 camper and need the passenger side seat.  Any
assistance would be appreciated.  I have also just finished developing a
website that is dedicated to building a database of parts and vintage
VW's that are for sale.  The address is vw.4biz_dot_net.  Check it out!
