&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 I have a 1960 standard with an mcode of 374.  Anyone know what this one is?
 Haven't been able to find it in any of the decoders.  Other than  ???  at
 least.
 
 I know what the others are, but this 374 is buggin me.
 
 Anyway the entire plate is as follows:
 
 18  12  9
 374   175
 UA   221  GRGREEN 549035
 
  &gt;&gt;
believe that is a US spec code, that is the one mid 57- that says no 
semaphores , you get blinkies, sealed beam headlights, miles speedo, etc ya 
know?  But since same code was used in 58 which had the stamped bumper, you 
also get M 175 for the overrider style us spec bumpers.

They dont list these things for some reason in the M-code list, so I make up 
explanations.

I tried to search the registry for certain m codes and combinations, but 
failed miserably.   Does Kanada use the same codes?  what about the kilometer 
thing?  or were they miles then too?
