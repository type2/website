Subject: BarnDoor Pics

I just uploaded a couple of interesting pictures 
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2172.JPG

Some of you may have seen this picture before,, but I thought it was worth
looking at again, with the interest in Barn Doors
I wish I had taken an interest to that Bus, when I had the chance to get it! 

And another Bus that is still for sale afaik, alot of you older guys will know
it as it has been discussed before ,, long time ago..
Check it out..
