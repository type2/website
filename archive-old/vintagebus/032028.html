 have been scratching my head all break trying to figure out why Sparky
won't idle.  First of all, the engine is a single port 1600, # AE with a
009.  When Sparky is cold, he starts right up and idles at 900 RPM and is
timed at 7.5 ATD (still trying to figure out best place!). When he warms
up, he stalls.  He will start right up again but it seems the is not enough
gas getting to the engine.  I tried to adjust the air fuel mixture but
nothing seems to happen.  What do you all think?  Thanks in advance.

If you sit in the bus and help it idle with your foot, will it eventually idle
n it's own?  One thing that happens is carb icing (lok at the neck of the
intake manifold under the carb when it stalls- ice?     Do you have your
preheat tube hooked up?   A thermostat set up will also help the engine warm
up properly.

My 65 westy has the preheat, but if I just let it sit and idle when started
cold in the morning, it will idle for a while, then get kinda rough and maybe
stall, then will smooth out again.  This is because of carb icing- even though
I have a preheat tube, these cold damp mornings really do that to the VW
motor.    My westy has a foor over the gas pedal (my not so secret anymore
left over from it being 70s customised sin- I have a foot for the high beam
switch too), but on my 59 truck I have a big wrench that lives on the floor
and I sit it in the hook at the toe side of the gas pedal and it helps it not
die when warming up in the morning (cause I like to let a bus sit and warm up
before I drive it  first thing especially if it is cold and damp outside.)

Just a thought
