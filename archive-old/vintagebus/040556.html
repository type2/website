Before I re-assemble just about anything
I dig through my selection of taps &amp; dies
and chase the threads, internal &amp; external.
Amazing how much easier things got together
when the threads are cleaned up.
There are special tap fluids on the market
that really do a great job of keeping
the tap edges sharp, faster, easier cutting, etc.
Just be sure to wear gloves with these products,
as they absorb into your skin rapdily, bad, bad.

I rummaged around in my 1/4 drive
(otherwise useless) sockets and
found a socket that fits the end of
most of the taps.
With the 1/4 to 3/8 adapter, and extensions
this allows me to reach threaded holes
when the T-handle interferes with
things.

When chasing threads, try it by hand first.
And I do mean by hand, fingers on tap/die.
Let the existing threads guide you.
If it takes more than finger pressure, caution.
You may be starting a new set of threads, could get nasty.

Personally I have rubbing alcohol in a small
spray bottle (adjustable nozzle) to
lube the threads.
Most of the action of a lube is to
flush away the chips anyway.

I hadn't thought of buying a set,
good idea, but I have 80% of what I
need already, and they're cheap.
