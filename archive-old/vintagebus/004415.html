Hello All

    I ask the list a few weeks back where I could get seat belts for my 
67 bus and I was told I could get them at Wolfsburg West. But I need to 
know where to mount them in the Bus. I have seatbelts in the front but 
the middle seat and rear seat they do not. Please Help!

Thanks in Advance!
