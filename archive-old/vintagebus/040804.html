OK, so I got these safari's on our bus, managed to get them off the 
bus and onto my workbench. Now I need to get the frames off the 
glass. I see the two screws on each side that I supose is holding
the frames together, but they seem to be frozen solid and of some
soft type of metal. Now the question, should I soak them with wd-40
and the like and hope they come loose, or just get the drill and an
ez out?

If I go the drill route, what kind of screw's are they? machine, or 
sheet metal?

Any other tricks I need to know to get these things apart?

Thanks
