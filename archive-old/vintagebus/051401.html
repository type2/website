Subject: RE: [VB] Rikki James/Outlaw

As far as I'm concerned, there are no rules. Do what you want. All original? 
Do it. Wild custom? Fine. My current project (with Ronnie's help) is a 63 
Micro that will look bone stock from the outside and have only minor 
interior improvements for the sake of comfort. An 1800 with freeway flyer, 
Berg shifter etc. A few suspension mods, sound system, and I'll have a daily 
driver that can exist on today's roads. What category is this? Who cares, 
it's fun.

&gt;Between Rikki James and John Jones a new era of buses is starting to 
&gt;evolve.
&gt;pure customs, true quality. If only the people who did some of the so 
&gt;called
&gt;restorations I have seen spent as much time there would be a lot of Quality
&gt;done buses out there. There is nothing wrong with Original buses, true
&gt;restored buses, reconditioned buses (most of them out there) or the TRUE
&gt;customs, just as long as there done with QUALITY in mind. I for one am one
&gt;of the reconditioned bus drivers, also have my 100% original driver and am
&gt;working on my TRUE mild custom (done right, like Dave Mayes) double cab.
&gt;   In closing all I can say is GO RIKKI GO and I'm sure John Jones won't be
&gt;far behind. I allready know his new project!

&gt;keep it stock
&gt;keep it custom
