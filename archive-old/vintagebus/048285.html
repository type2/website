re a 62 bus:

1) Are mis-matched bearings OK ?
- - -  - 
I generally reuse my front wheel bearings.  Usually they are good,  But if
when I have taken them out and cleaning them up I fing shavings and/ot they
are rusted stuck (ish) time for new ones.     If the inner one is a differnt
brand than the outer ne dont worry, as long as they are the right ones.   I
have differnt brands on the R and L of my 65, as I had to replace one side.


2) Should I try to find used cylinders or should I fork over the dinero for

the new

     ones?
- -- --
kick down, kind rainbow brother.   In fact, I thought they were about $32
apiece for the front wheel cylinders.   The 63 and earlier F ones have only
been available German for some time (in 89 that's what I learned when I had to
buy some), which costs more.    I recommend also buying the rubber brake hoses
(all four).  If your master cylinder is bad, a new brasilian one is $30, maybe
a bit less, so just toss it and get a new one.

about looking like a dork in front of the VW dude- dont worry.  When I was
figuring out my first bus, I asked them all kinds of questions- how to do
this, how to tell if that was good, what else to check.   I guess I was a
pita, but when I go back to that shop once i a while they actually remember me
in a friendly way.

PS, as you are Portland, why not head up to Puyallup for Octobugfest on the
18th.   You can find bits for your bus there.  I'm sure other P town people
are going
