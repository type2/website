Subject: [VB] want less steering play

Hi -

Many thanks to all who have helped me with my questions.  Its been almost a year since I aquired my 64 bus and its gone from a non idling, rusty tank, no electrical stuff working at all, scraping brakes, shot tie rod end, broken windshield, bad welded in front seats from another vehicle, dead shocks, bad valve clearances, etc ..etc to a pretty nice runing braking legal bus with correct 1/3 2/3 seats working locks etc etc etc.

I want to do some work on the steering.  I have replaced only the drivers side tie rod end so far ( not to fix steering but just to be safer ).
The steering is a bit sloppier than it needs to be.  Whats the best order of toubleshooting.

I was thinking of replacing the drag link, then the steering damper, then adjusting the steering box.  WW sells a swing lever kit that looks like it might tighten things up a bit, what kind of job is that anyway?

Am I on the right track?

- thanks rob
