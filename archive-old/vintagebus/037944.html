But....Ebay has a special place for this type of stuff, it is called negative 
feedback. And then they also have e mail addresses available to contact

&lt;&lt; This is exactly the type of thing which should be aired on the list.  If I 
 bid on an item on ebay from this vendor, (which I have done), I would be 
very 
 appreciative of anyone who's had a bad experience with him to let me know 
 what that consisted of. &gt;&gt;
