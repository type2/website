My 57 has a grey gastank with L311 sand green paint entirely inside the 
engine compartment.
I have never seen a painted gastank.....
But you never know.......

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Hey there guys and gals..
 While the motor is out of the 62...I thought I'd take the opportunity to
 clean all of the crud out of the engine compartment.  The gas tank is
 turquoise, and the rest is black.  Is this the common color
 configuration?  What determined what color the gas tank was painted?
 Are all engine bays painted black?  I borrowed a pressure washer and
 some environmentally friendly degreaser.  Can I spray out the engine
 compartment with this?  I don't want to have the degreaser wreck any of
 the paint...and I will read all of the applications for use before
 hand....  Has anyone else done this before?  How does it turn out?  I'll
 tape off the voltage regulator to keep it dry...
 
 Another license plate possibility which I am really liking... (just
 thought of it) is DRIVEIT ....yeahhhhh... :)
