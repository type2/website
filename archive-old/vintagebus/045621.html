 Berg has been know for years to be the king of the hill, the top of the
 line, A++++++, in quality and service &gt;&gt;

I'm not sure which Gene Berg Enterprises you're referring to, but the ine 
I've been to in Anaheim has TERRIBLE service.  The guards at the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier are friendlier than most people there. Tim (the service 
manager) and Mrs Berg herself are the 2 I've talked with most and their 
service leaves something to be desired.  I wont go into detais, but they 
arent very friendly.

I was lucky enough to talk to Clyde one year at the Classic and he was really 
nice.  He listened to what I had to say and answered my questions.  Too bad 
he's not around very much in the showroom or near the phone.

I will admit that the parts Berg sells are top notch, but their customer 
service and their mechanical service will not get my return business.

I dont know if the place was the same when Gene was alive, I doubt it though 
and fear it's gone down since his death.
