&gt; What are the recommendations for rust removal ?? Getting in the tight spots
&gt; too.  Something liquid ?

Hi Diane,
We use phosperic acid one get can from your local chemical supplier in 20 
gallon containers, and use a auto body degreaser to remove the residue in hard to 
reach areas or hand sand off the dried remains in those areas you can reach 
easily.  There is also &quot;Naval Jelly&quot; rust removal at your local hardware store. 
 Either works best in cool weather with plastic wrap laid over it to prevent 
the rust removal chemical from drying out before it fully removes the rust.  
Heavy rust will require many applications and will be sped up with sanding and 
wire wheeling betweenb these coats of rust removal.   Afterward use a high 
zinc content primer with at least 85% zinc content the higher the percentage the 
better the rust protection.  Then apply a couple of coats of paint over that.
