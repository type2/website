HiCraig,
Mar55 to AUG63!  The funny thing is that the bore size of the 1955-67 brake
cylinders are the same size.  The 1964-67 ones just have a thicker base to
align the thier center line to the center line of the 1964-67 wider brake
shoes and drums.  One could make shims to make the earlier brake cylinders
work in the later brake system.
