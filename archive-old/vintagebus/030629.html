Subject: fan shroud

Hello there,
I have a fan shroud that I painted up for my engine and I am unsure 
where it came from.  It is a doghouse fan shroud, no suprise in what it 
is, but it has a ring of sorts on the front of it (FIF) over the fan 
hole.  It has 4 tabs that are spot welded to the ring and to the shroud 
to hold it on.  Its a ring, but it is almost like a cone and goes into 
the shroud a bit.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  I'm 
wondering why that ring is there.  Is it to prevent a whistle or 
something from the air being drawn into the fan?  I assume its from some 
random late model beetle...
