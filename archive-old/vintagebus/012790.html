I have one of his excellent side safari windows (replaces the cooker
window pop-out) and I have nothing but praise for it. I got it
supplied in primer finish (chrome is also available) and recently had
it powder coated. It looks fantastic (green tinted glass - way
cool!). Now all i need is 5 more... and front and rear safaris too,
hubba hubba!!
Tell him MIke from the Isle of Man sent ya!
