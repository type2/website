Subject: Re: [VB] SOLUTION: Oil Pump leaking like an Exxon tanker

Hi Jason,
Good to hear you fixed your problem.  In our opinion if one has the  use 
sealant between the pump and cover there is something  seriously wrong.  Plus we 
do not like using sealant there because if  too much is used any excess can 
clog up an oil passage.  One  should use studs not bolts for the reason you 
found. Also studs can easily be  threaded in fully for the most strength and be 
left in so as not to wear  out the soft aluminum/magnesium alloy threads in the 
stock engine  case by threading in and out over and over.
