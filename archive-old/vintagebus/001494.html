That article is so poorly written that I'm pesimistic of it's origin as
well. There may be a grain of truth in it though. I seem to recall (less and
less of that as time slips by) that to keep a copywrite or trademark, the
owner has to defend it. If that is truely the case then VW is between a rock
and a hard place. They can't really support us and keep their rights. I just
hope that they hunt for infringement as little as they can in order to save
their rights.
