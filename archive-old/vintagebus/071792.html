Subject: Re: [VB] A friday issue

Was the 1979 an automatic? Could have been AT coolers.
Your 72s gear ratios will make for short shifts with the 2.0L The last
loaf I drove had a 1972 trans in a 1975 drivetrain, felt like I wished I
could have stayed in each gear longer to take advantage of that torque.
Good luck with her!

&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas on what the coolers are?  Must be oil.  If so, she sure ran
&gt; cool!
