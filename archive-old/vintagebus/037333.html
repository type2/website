Subject: Fabric source needed
CC: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone have any suggestions of where to find fabric? I need some vintage 
plaid for my 56 westfalia. The &quot;BLOCKS&quot; are roughly 46mm square. The 
&quot;stripes&quot; (outside of black line to outside of black line) are roughly 43mm. 
This is the fabric used on all the curtains and the bedding in my camper. I 
would like to find something close. Doesn't need to be exact, but the basic 
color and style would be good. Any help GREATLY apreciated. The close up 
(second photo) is the correct color, the large view (first photo) is faded 
severly but shows the 
pattern better. THANKS! Greg
