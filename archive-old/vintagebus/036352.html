Hi everyone,

I just got a VERY complete set of 32-PDSIT dual carbs w/ matching dizzy
in suprizingly good condition and was wondering if anyone out there has
ever fitted them to a 1500/1600 upright engine before??  After I took
them home, I sat behind my bus with the engine lid open looking and
trying to figure out what would need to be fabricated in order to
physically install them on my bus.  Obviously I would need to weld up
two new manifolds to fit my heads and would also need to move over the
tab where the throttle cable attaches about 4&quot; (and possibly shorten
the rod).  So what else am I missing??  Would these carbs be worth the
work to get them to fit or would it be better to just use ICT's or
another aftermarket carb set??  

I'm currently using a 30PICT-1 and have no real complaints with it's
performance and milage (currently 24.2 mpg).  I just like to tinker and
make non-perminant, easy to return to original changes to see what the
performance might be like if. . . (READ: I can't leave well enough
alone ;-) )  Well there you have it.  Any opinions/experience with
this??
