Hey ya'll volks:

BA  in Creative Writing and Eng. Lit.  Wrote poetry and stories. Got
published. Floundered around in the media:  tv stations, newspapers.
Hated it.  I abandoned hope and started freelance writing in my spare
time for magazines.  Then, after working for THE MAN and getting nowhere,
I quit.  Now I freelance full-time and write copy for web pages, steel
companies, you name it:  Wordmotor Brand writing, editing, research and
word design (Atlanta, GA).  Hey, now I don't sit in rush hour and I have
more time to enjoy the bus!  check out my page.  It will be up in a week
or so!  www.wordmotor_dot_com

&quot;Hope is a bad thing.  It means that you are not what you want to be. It
means that part of you is dead, if not all of you.  It means that you
entertain illusions. It's sort of a spiritual clap, I should say.&quot;
