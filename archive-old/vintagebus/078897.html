Subject: Re: [VB] 6V starting troubles

I have your answer...try this procedure.  The symptoms sound like those I
have had, and this has worked (and kept working) every time.

Remove starter from car.  Take solenoid off.  Using Liquid Wrench (my
favorite), douse the inside of the solenoid thoroughly, moving the plunger
in and out and turning it.  Do this a lot.

Move the starter around too.  Lube both units with a quality teflon lube, or
good gear oil.  I like the Teflon stuff, then a bit of gear lube, just to
keep things in the area.

Reassemble, and check it out!

The books say replace, but I say clean!  The solenoid moves the bendix,
(click), but also closes contacts which activate the starter motor.  It is
these contacts that get dirty.

Good luck!
