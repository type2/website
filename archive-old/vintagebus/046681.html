 Today I felt like doing something special for my bus. (I don't have a
 name for her yet, but she looks kinda like a pirate ship, and I'm
 thinking about &quot;Gypsy&quot;.) I got a better radio from the pile of used
 radios at work and hooked it up. I've got 3 pairs of speakers, each pair
 with thier own amp, so I'd hafta say I gotta kick-&amp;$$ system. Then I
 went to Radio Shack and got a 4 channel stereo mixer that will plug into
 the stereo thru the CD jack, so I can plug my keyboard and my son's
 guitar and maybe a microphone into it...
 
 Next camp-in, watch out you accoustic freaks! We WON'T be &quot;Unplugged&quot;!
