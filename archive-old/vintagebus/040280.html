I agree about the shysters in the VW world, and how many can be avoided
here. I wish I had found this list and the ads often on it, shared from
newspapers, sightings, personals sales, and local friends. I was convinced I
would never find a moderate to no rust bus on the east coast, and spent out
the nose for a mis represented ebay bus that is going to cost me a mint (if
it hasn't already), make me learn everything about a bus as I put it
together right (ok, maybe that's a plus), buy a new set of tools (another
plus, ok now the bad)...WHEN I could have had the chance to do those things
and spend alot less for the same sort of thing, or get what I REALLY wanted,
a moderate cost bus that looked good and ran great, with it possibly being
closer to me. I read these ads now and what to scream, as I see things I
would have went after, or would have rather have instead for THAT many
thousands, and now they might be gone, never to benefit others that might be
smarter than I was in the future...

&lt;&lt; WAITAMINUTE - I get it now! This whole thing has been concocted by Erin
as
 another way to stroke his ego!!! We all have to yell &quot;pretty please don't
 make us sad Erin&quot; just like Caesar and the Roman Senate.... well, NQ, we're
 ON to you boy!. &gt;&gt;

Anybody thinking along this route is waaaaaay off base.  I have known Erin
for several years now and have had him stay at my house several times.
There
isn't an over-ego'd ounce in his body.  He is the kind of guy who says
&quot;Thanks&quot; 10 times for everything, makes the bed when he gets up, does the
dishes for you, and would do anything to help you out at anytime.

I think the main problem is that the (VW) world is so full of shysters that
when someone genuine comes along you/we have difficulty believing it.  You
can believe it when Erin says he is posting to help other people out.  You
can believe it when Erin posts that he drove 150+ one way miles to help me
get my Binz ready for my move.  You can believe it when Erin says he met
some
list members at BBB and really liked them.  And, you can believe it when
myself and the list members from BBB post that they really liked Erin.
