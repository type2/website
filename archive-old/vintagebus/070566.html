Subject: RE: [VB] door seals

Isn't there an area of overlap by the rear edge of the door near the
beltline? Perhaps the cause of seemingly extra length, or is this in
addition to that?

There's no secret; when you've got them scrunched up fairly well, and
they're still long, then cut them to length. That's my policy, and it's
worked well. Others may have different suggestions...

&gt; I am putting in new seals on my doors, cargo doors, and engine lid,

&gt; up a little because they shrink later, which makes sense,  but I just
&gt; can't seem to squeeze them together enough to fit them in at their
&gt; present length. Is there some secret to this?
