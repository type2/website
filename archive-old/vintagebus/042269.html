Yes, there are a number of diesel-engined vehicles running on vegetable
oil.  Mostly the oil is discarded from deep-fryers in restaurants.  If too
many people start doing this the price of french fries will skyrocket!

Other than some filtering, I think that they used the vegetable oil as is.
I don't know how this would work in cold winters, as the oil would congeal
at low temps.
