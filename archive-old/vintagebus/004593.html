Hey Dave,

We are lloking forward to seeing you at Full Moon in Joon.

I gotta say, though, I really don't think low compression could ever be
responsible for overheating.

Tom

&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; I haven;t been real active on the lists lately, lots happening chez
Burrito.
&gt;   Kids getting outta school, Full Moon Bus Club campouts, and diagnostics.
&gt; Recent work on the Express is simple valve adjustment, remove the BN4
heater
&gt; (still available p-mail if interested), and finding a Dormobile vent cover
&gt; (Thanks Sue Dolvin!)
&gt; The Burrito Express has been performing daily driver duties, as well as
some
&gt; camping and 'cruising'.
&gt; Kids getting outta school rocks, because I get outta work early enough we
&gt; can go swimming and such in the afternoons.  I pay the price with early to
&gt; rise syndrome.  That's ok though, the kids and dogs don't care.
&gt; You probably already read a trip report on May Be Busses (and some
&gt; grumblings due to last minute relocation).  Sorry folks, Myrtle Beach
wasn't
&gt; the happening place unless you wanted to listen to unmuffled Harleys and
&gt; drunk folks all night long in a packed campground.  If that's what you're
&gt; into, I recommend Huntington Beach State Park the weekend before Memorial
&gt; day.  Good luck finding a site.  We ended up at Santee State Park, a good
&gt; central location for about all of South Carolina and handy to folks North
&gt; and South of us as well, it's right off I95.  The west might take a bit
more
&gt; time...
&gt; Diagnostics - As you may recall, the Express has been running warmer than
I
&gt; care to see.  Can hardly hold the dipstick after a medium to long run.  I
&gt; like being able to hold my
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; dipstick (what WERE you thinking?).
&gt;
&gt; Fred Stoermer said do the plug test.  DOH!  I did it Fred, the electrodes
&gt; are a light tan/grey.  There's a deposit of carbon around the 'outside' of
&gt; the plug, you were right on Fred.  One of the local Weber experts was
&gt; happily selling me jets, but as we talked, suggested that Sherry had built
a
&gt; wonderful engine, though the compression ratio is quite suitable for a
&gt; supercharged or turbocharged engine, but for normal aspiration the
&gt; compression is too low (6.8:1).  The result is inefficient combustion,
with
&gt; the attendent heat production as a result.
&gt; This weekend is engine pull, remove 0.030 shims, and bump the compression
to
&gt; about 7.8:1.  I'm also roughing in the Styrofoam templates for the remote
&gt; oil cooler duct system, prelocate the system, and remove the remaining
&gt; Eberspacher ductwork and tinware.
&gt; Oh yeah, my friend Mike, the guy that tried to ride his BMW through a bus
&gt; fulla tourista might be coming down this weekend to visit.  He doesn't
have
&gt; full use of his arms and other parts, so he'll be a high maintenence guest
&gt; looking on...  Maybe he can hand wrenches and stuff.  The puppy doesn't
&gt; fetch the correct size every time yet, the kids get bored and the wife
gets
&gt; offended by all the cussing...
&gt;
&gt; It's Burrito time so I'll post later with results.
&gt;
&gt; Later taters
&gt; Dave
&gt; &quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
