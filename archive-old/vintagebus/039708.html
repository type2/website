&gt;Dear List,
&gt;
&gt;I will be converting my 67 single cab to IRS using 69 bus parts , this is
&gt;not usual but I will be welding the whole 69 rear-end at the frame , this



Wow are you going to catch some flak for this!!! I wouldnt do it, I loved 
reduction boxes, such a neat idea......anyway.......


&gt;means I will use 69 trans. and will use the rear engine hanger of it too
&gt;,but my T1 engine has no mount to attach it to hanger !! what can be done ?
&gt;I heard a kit to use bug engine in T2 (68 79) busses this can work but 
&gt;where
&gt;can it be found ? or can I make a mount attached to oil pump cover ?
&gt;

Avoid this simple solution of mounting to the oil pump cover, it doesnt need 
or like the extra stress. Lets look at a few things:
1. If you have a case that can be tapped to accept the screws do that.
2. IF you dont, with all the trouble of making it IRS get a universal case.0
3. Use a drag race type bar (you can order one) to make a carrier that holds 
the engine up.


Why, oh why do you want to do this? What do you think you will accomplish? 
There are many aftermarket parts to make your conering better. I hate 
lowering, but a lowered bus with a rear stablizer will be a better solution 
to handling then a welded in IRS.

Jason.
(I shouldnt be here, I dont even have a split anymore, but the 70 runs great 
now with 15 inch wheels, low profile and a 1776 with a BIG ASS oil filter on 
it!!!!!!!!!)
