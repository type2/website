&lt;&lt; Speaking of filtration, and not to start a war here, could i have some 
opinions of installing a MaxiPump3 with a Mesa48 cooler, and flow thru filter 
on my 1600 '71.&gt;&gt;
Hi Renoir,
First you must have all engine to body seals, and all parts of your engine 
cooling tin in good condtion.  Next you really need a wide cooling fan, and 
if you are running a doghouse system it is a must to have at least a 33 or 
better yet a 35mm wide cooling fan, and 2:1 lower pulley.
  We just do not like having hoses that can be caught, torn, worn or burnt by 
the exaust.  Are you running a doghouse system?  Have you considered having 
it modified to install a type 4 cooler that has 40% more cooling surface area?

&lt;&lt;On very long grades, loaded down for camping, temperatures go very high.&gt;&gt;
Have you been running gauges?  What type of temp are you getting at what RPMs?
 
&lt;&lt;For example, the long Yosemite grade, and Cajon pass north of San Bernadino
 are a bear for temperature, and i really do not push it.  &gt;&gt;
Been there, done those!  We have found the VW upright engine under load up 
very steep slopes is much happier between 2,500-3,000 RPM, and in really hot 
weather about 2,500-2,800 RPM.  So not only running too high of RPM will heat 
up the engine, but running too low of RPM will do the same.  You are really 
better off down shifting to keep the engine at a moderate RPM!   Eric&amp;Barb
