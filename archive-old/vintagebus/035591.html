&lt;&lt; This is just a guess but would a Swiss prepped bus have different gearing
in
 the tranny or redux boxes to cope with the local topography? O seem to to
 recall folks refering to &quot;mountain gearing.&quot;
  &gt;&gt;
Hmm, good thinking Chris.  If the tranny is the original on from the factory
and if it was a mountian geared tranny then it would have the letter &quot;M&quot;
stamped in front of the tranny ID number.  It would also be interesting to
check the manufacture date of the tranny ID number also.   Eric &amp; Barb
