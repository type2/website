hey... its VERY interesting to me to see this thread pop up. a listee friend 
of mine helped me tear down pretty much my entire engine except pulling the 
heads off. we replaced all the seals and stuff and i installed the engine 
back in. saturday i left for Detroit to go to the VWoA show... i stopped to 
whiz and looked under my bus for the hell of it, and there was like a pint 
of oil on the ground under the rear main!!!! (not oil cooler seals) this is 
why i pulled the engine over the winter. now, this was after traveling about 
100 miles at like 4500rpm. on the way home last night i kept it at 55mph and 
4000rpm and every time i stopped there was like 4 drops of oil on the 
ground. didnt even need to add all the way home... ~175mi. WHAT GIVES?! 
someone suggested a little nick on the cam chewing up the rear main. i dont 
get it... people say aircooled VWs are supposed to drip, i dont think so. 
what should i do, pull and replace rear main again?!

thanks for reading,
Bob in Cleveland
