  What the heck, what are you guys doing on the web?  You should be out there
 working on the BUS!!!!!!!!!  Thom is the inside of the &quot;yellow banana bus&quot; done?  
 Kabayo, don't you have some extra cash to spend on your bus? Ronnie, start 
 putting the &quot;super single-port&quot; together!  If I'm working on mine, so should you!
   Have a busful day,
   Lou in Havasu
PS. &quot;You know your in Arizona when..........
            The best parking spot is determined by SHADE-not distance!&quot;
