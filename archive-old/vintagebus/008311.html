Hi Everyone,

     I just returned from my trip to SoCal and thought I'd share the hap's.
I had to go down there (El Centro, CA) primarily for work, but I was able to
get out on some of my time off.  The highlight of my trip was attending
Busses By the Bridge IV in lake Havasu, AZ.

     On the way down to El Centro from my house in Lemoore, I opted to just
keep it simple and travel down I-5 to San Diego and then across on I-8.  It
was about an 8 hour drive for my splitty and was booooorrriiiinnnnggg as any
other time I went that route.  I had one brief moment of excitement when I
was coming into El Cajon and I lost al power and died on the shoulder of the
hwy (Oh Nooooo).  It turned out that the inlet to the fuel pump came out and
I had basically run out of gas.  So I was forced to change the pump where I
died (which was about 5 feet from speeding traffic.  luckily for me, out of
all the parts on my VW to break, the one that did was the ONLY one that I
had a brand-spankin' new replacement part for.  5 minutes and I was on my
way.  I was forced to refill my tank since I leaked about 5-7 gallons worth
of gas all over my hot engine and exhaust.  I carry an extinguisher and was
thankful I didn't have to use it that day.

     I spent 2 weeks working in El Centro and then it was time for BBB4
(WooHooo!!!!).

     On Friday the 21st I jetted out of work at around 10:30am and hit the
road by 11:00.  Since I had never driven through the Imperial Valley's
northern end, I opted for hwy 78N right through Glamis OHV area.  All I can
say is WOW.  I don't know what some of those folks do for a living to be
able to afford some of the high $$$ rails I saw, but all I can say is, &quot;It
must be nice!!!&quot;   I was really looking forward to seeing the infamous
&quot;Glamis&quot; and was surprised to see that all it was, was basically one
building town in the middle of the dunes with a bunch of rails, quads and
motos surrounding it.  Weird!!  But in a kewl sort of way ;-)  I-78 was a
really interesting road to travel once you left the dunes area because it
had lots of dips in the road that made you feel almost weightless at times;
a real rollercoaster ride.  If only my bus were faster. I could have REALLY
had some fun!!

     My mistake of the trip came when I decided to take I-10E and pick up
95N in Quartzite, AZ.  I recalled someone on the Vintagebus list mentioning
last year that Quartzite was an &quot;interesting experience&quot; when they went to
BBB3.   Well. . . now I know what &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; really
meant.  Se habla, SNOWBIRDS by the MILLIONS?!?!?  I've never seen so many
old folks and RVs in my life!!!!!!  &quot;Interesting&quot; was how long it took my to
travel through that nothing town!!!  The &quot;experience&quot; was getting passed in
the street by someone's grandpa on one of those Lil' Rascal 3 wheeled
electric carts!!!!  Humbling even for a splitty pilot like myself.  After a
full hour wasted, I made my way out of Quartzite and spent the remainder of
the un-eventful drive doing what I do best, holding up the flow of traffic.
:-)

     I made it into Havasu about 4pm and was able to get a good spot along
the edge.  Everyone there was just super.  It was nice to finally put faces
with so many of the names on this list, though I must admit that I'm
terrible at remembering who's name goes with who's face (just ask my kids
;-) )  The folks of the London Bridge Bullis did a super job organizing the
putting on the event.  And a special thanks to VWHoward for all his efforts.
He and several others were VERY busy folks behind the scenes.  Over all it
was just the way I like a meet to be: laid back and relaxing with a little
craziness thrown in for good measure.  A short list of folks I met from the
list were Kyle (w/ the Westfailure), Clara, Ronnie, VWHoward, Uncle Jerry &amp;
Melissa, Harry H.,  Karl, Dawn S., Stephen G. &amp; Tristan, Jay W. and the list
goes on and on.  For 2 1/2 days I was on bus overload; it was GREAT!!

     For the trip back to El Centro, CA, I was invited to carabus back to
Yuma, AZ with Jay W. and his friends (who's names escape me at the moment,
sorry).  I really appreciated the invite to tag along.  The only real
excitement on the way to Yuma (besides seeing VW's front and rear) was the
opportunity to get severely tailgated my an older couple in a Y*y*ta Camery.
Well there's nothing real exciting about getting tailgated, BUT about 5
miles up the road I took FULL advantage of the opportunity to honk and wave
at the same couple as they were involved in deep negotiations with the local
law enforcement. :-)  It's kinda funny; I don't recall being passed by them
again. . . Hummm?? :-)

     Jay invited me over to his house in El Centro later in the week to get
an education in the inner workings of a tranny since I had mentioned during
a previous conversation that I was &quot;transmissionally challenged&quot; (A.K.A. - a
tranny idiot).  I happily accepted and was not disappointed with the
education and conversation of the evening.  Jay has made most of his own
special tranny tools and many other ones too from scraps and pieces he has
lying around the shop.  A very ingenious fella for sure and one heck of a
knowledgeable guy.  Thanks for the education, Jay!!

     My trip back to Lemoore was more appealing than the trip down.  I
decided to take hwy 86 along the Salton Sea into palm springs, then take
I-10 through San Bernardino, then turn north on hwy 395 into Bakersfield.
The scenery was really nice compared to the alternative (L.A./ San Diego
traffic) and the traffic was light the whole way.  Now that I'm finally back
in Lemoore, I already miss the scenery of the past 3 weeks.

     I had originally planned to stay an extra day in El Centro and hit the
OCTO show tomorrow, but I had been gone just too long and I missed my wife
and all my girls, so I guess the OCTO show will just have to go on without
me this time.  We will be at the one this summer though!! :-)

     Sorry this is so long but 3 weeks of VW bussin' and campin' is hard to
squeeze into a few sentences ;-)  BTW, does anyone still have the copies of
the 3(?) pics of listees at BBB4 that I heard made it too the lists??  I've
been unsubscribed and missed them so if someone could send me a copy, I'd
appreciate it, Thanks.
