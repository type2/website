Hey all,

Friday nite went out to dinner and the bus did alright, on the way home 
supper slugish loss of power and the outside temp was probably 50 degrees 
(I'm in SC).  Saturday I adjusted the valves (only been 2k since last 
adjustment)  and #1 and #3 were a bit tight 004 slid in with much friction 
and I like to adjust mine the same with 006.  Readjusted the ol point gap 
and re set my timing....Bus ran like a scalded dog he he he!  My girlfriend 
drove hime yesterday and today he was supper slugish.  I let him run for 
10-15 minutes and headed to work, about 19 degrees this morning.  He usually 
takes 1-2 miles to totally warm up and want to go highway speed 50-60mph, 
but he didn't totally warm up until one mile from work, about 20 miles 
later!  Could my stay-lube 90/100 weight tranny oil be slowing me down?  Any 
ideas?  Would be grateful cause my a1gti is down and the bus is our sole 
transport from pitchforks to civilization and work!

TIA,

Eric
