&gt; Shipping to Canada is only a pain insomuch as the extra customs form you
&gt; have to fill out, and then wait forever for it to get there.  I sent a
&gt; small package to another Canadian listmember, and it took over 2 months to
&gt; get there.  It would have been faster to deliver it myself...

True! Not only does it take forever to arrive, but you are taxed on the full
amount. Living in Toronto, I'm about 2 hrs. from the US border. I rent a
USPS P.O. Box near the border, and drive to pick up my parts. . Works like a
charm, and rarely have to pay tax..
  The only downfall is the border line-ups. Canadians crossing over for
cheap booze and smokes, and the Americans coming over for Cuban cigars, and
our uncensored nudie bars.....Man, I hate border towns..
my 2 cents...
