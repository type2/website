Looking for the best reasons to own a VW

1.  Take life slow and enjoy the view in all directions.
2.  It really doesn't matter what anyone else thinks as long as you're happy.
3.  Don't act like a bad _at_$$ when your doing 55 in a 75.
4.  Seek and destroy any problems which may cross your path. (but not 
animals!)
5.  BE CAREFUL OUT THERE!
6.  Be kind to people.
7.  OIL SPOTS are the greatest revenge.

????

Give me some more!
