&gt; Too late to have done it right, such as clean it up before

Pull the engine out and clean up the mess. Cover the tranny bell and 
starter motor.  You don't want sand on the tranny shaft or throwout 
bearing. 
Pulling the engine is a simple routine job with a decent floor jack and 
will give you practice!
