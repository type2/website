Subject: Re: [VB] 61 Westy: INFESTED WITH BEES!!!

everything bill owns is for sale... if the price is right.  prolly the only thing that isn't for sale is his dick... well, not to another dude.  both he and i are partial to women and buses.  thom, i know bill said that i attempted to molest that barndoor corner you recently bought from him.  it's all a damn lie cuz i only act if invited and that corner was inviting.  hey, is it still friday?
