&gt; Ok, this 1966 bus thing is new to me. I drag the bus down off the car dolly
&gt; and it sits askew off my driveway. The back brakes are frozen somehow, so I
&gt; crawl under yesterday to back off the star adjustment thingy. #)*&amp;^_at_#%_at_ There
&gt; is no adjustment hole. Is it behind the reduction boxes? How does one get out
&gt; of this catch 22? 
&gt;  -- - - - 
&gt; take off the hubcap- the hole is easily accessable - you don have to crwl 

Problem is, if the drums are frozen he won't be able to rotate them to
align the hole with the stars.  Another puzzler.  Pull the drums?  Bang
with hammer?  Hmmm?
