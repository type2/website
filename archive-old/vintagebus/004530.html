NQ

I have worked on similar problems several times. The best first step has
always been to clean the battery posts and all battery cable ends including
any ground straps. Insure that the metal ends on the straps are bright and
shiny. Remove any corrosion or paint from the body/frame/engine attaching
points before reattaching the cables.

Hope this helps

Bill
