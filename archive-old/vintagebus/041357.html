Hey Now!

 About 9 months ago I made a deal for what I thought was a rear seat.  It
came in two sections: A lower seat section and an upper backrest.  They
were independent of each other.  There were also no signs of a grab bar on
the back of the backrest.  After doing a little hunting I found that this
is really, as far as I know now, a &lt;61 full length bench front seat.  Doh!

So, since then I've been tryin' to look at show busses to see what the
rear seat looked like and how it worked.  So far no luck because I haven't
been able to get inside.  I saw one bus that was damaged but it had all
the org. panels and seats.  The middle seat wasn't bolted down at all and
was cast over the top of the rear seat making it hard to get a close look
without moving things around.

So, how does it work!? Are there braces that hold the two sections
together?  Would anyone be willing to put up some quick digi pics for me
to look at(before I make another buy).  Any info would be welcomed!
