Hi all,

I know this has been a thread in the past but can anyone tell me how to trim
the rubber of a vent window under the rain deflector????  It looks like crap
from the back/inside as it's all bunched up.  I tried cutting the rubber a
little on one of the windows as I was installing it so the rubber would lie
flat instead of bunching up but it still doesn't look too good to me from
the back side.  (yes, I am installing the rubber in the frame prior to
putting in the glass as per the manual).
 Also, It seems that I can get the lower portion of the window to seat
nicely in the bottom rail as it fits in the slot for the latch... am I
missing something?  There always remains an 1/8 inch or more.  I can squeeze
the frame a bit from top to bottom which pushes the window into the frame
but when I take the clamp off, it springs back out... will this go away when
mounted in the door frame? but this doesn't seem right.... argh.

TIA... and I think I'm off to building the jig as seen in the manual to put
these things together or does anyone know who has one?
