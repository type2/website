&lt;&lt; The PO said that #3 was about 20 pounds lower than the rest, Thai's why I

go bad on just 1 cyl???  &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Oh yes!  We had one engine handed down to us that always went through a quart 
of oil every 500 miles.  When we took it apart it turned out that one of the 
compression rings had broken and thusly worn the cylinder into a slight oval.
