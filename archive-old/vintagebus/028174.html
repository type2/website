Subject: Powdercoating Reference:  Bumpers and Rims
Date: Sat, 24 Mar 2001 10:28:45 -0800

Hello again...

I am writing because I am looking at the prospect of powdercoating my rims
and bumpers.  I went to www.dropgates_dot_com, where I remembered there was info
as far as color-matching the powder color to Silver-white (correct for rims,
bumpers, yes?), and the site is down.  Bogus!  I hope not for long?!?
Anyway, the powder people are asking &quot;What color?&quot; an it would be good for
me to be specific, as that affects their quotes significantly.  Anyone got
the info?

The last guy I talked to said probably $300 for the lot (4 rims and 2
bumpers with overriders...blasting and coating) and then any special color
charge.  Comments?

TIA!

Gene
