Not to get any more bunched panties out there, but when I was in retail, it
was the county of residence that mattered; i.e. I sell you a vehicle in Orange
co. which has a tax rate of 7.75, but you live in L.A. co. which has an 8.25
tax rate, I was responsible to collect the higher tax rate. If however you
lived out of state, you were responsible to pay the tax to your state. The
same applied to mail order, if you were'nt a Calif res it didn't matter to me
or the state. This is one of the things that make retailers mad at strictly
mailorder outfits. 'Course things might have changed, what does Ron do?
Bottom line is the customer is allways right even when hes wrong. I was
thinking of buying some CB's products on my next engine, now I'll have to
rethink
