Subject: Motor problem......

--0-684393718-1021771702=:31760


 Remember me saying how I found metal flakes in my oil, well, I took the motor out and put a different one in until I fix the one for it, but i found out that the flakes are magnetic, so wouldthey be from rings? bearings?  well, I guess I'll find out when I open the motor........ 
 
thanks! 
Matt
