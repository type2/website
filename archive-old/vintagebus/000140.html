Hi Thom,
The reason we did not reccomend Hobart is that they just recently sold off 
thier welding branch of thier business.  Meaning no more parts, or very high 
priced ones!  We found this out recently when the low voltage solinoid 
electrical switch in the trigger of our Hobert Handler went out.  New switch 
would cost us $25.00, or $125.00 for a complete new outer liner, and 
trigger/nozzle from another brand that would fit.  Went down to Radio Shack, 
and bought two momentary push switches for $4.00.  With a little craving, and 
melting of a ring depression with a red hot penny the switch fit perfect, and 
we have a spare!    
  Even if Hobart was not going out of business we probably would now go with 
the Lincoln.  They have had a kit to modify/add onto the welder to do spot 
welding!    Eric&amp;Barb
