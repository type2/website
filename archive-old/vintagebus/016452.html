Hey everyone,

Waited till friday to post this one.  I was in orange county a couple of 
weeks ago, and ran into a nice bus owner, he was driving a late '63 kombi, 
what I thought was interesting was that it had &quot;innie&quot; vents, but small back 
hatch, fried egg turn signals, flip out front door handles.  The owner also 
told me that it had the bigger later brakes.  I can only remember the first 
three chassis #, 114 so I guess this bus was really close to the '64 
changeover.

Anyway, I thought it was kind of interesting.

Mike Anderson
'64 SO-35
