&lt;&lt; Sorry if this question has come up and I missed it, but I need interior 
 panels and seat covers for my 67 21 Window walk-thru.  I am finally going to 
 attempt to put it on the road in the next couple of months after a 3 year 
 holding pattern.  How is TMI???  I hear they put out a decent product.   I 
 am thinking of something in middle in line, I am not doing a perfect $35k 
 resto on this one........  More like a $5k resto :)
 
 Who does headliners/sliding rags for busses in the Sacrameto area??
 
 Also, to save the list from more repeated questions from people like myself, 
 is there not an archive somewhere that we can search for topics that have 
 already come up?  Where do you go?
 
 TIA

TMI is good.  I dont really like the new vinyl smell, but I suppose new vinyl 
smells like new vinyl.  They have a lot more colours available now, including 
some original style splitty upholstery.  If you wanted to have your bus seats 
similiar to what they were like when new.  Someone posted it recently, I 
think on the Wolfsberg West page they have up the original colours  (inside 
and out) the buses came with.  Maybe it is on Thoms or Everett's page too.
