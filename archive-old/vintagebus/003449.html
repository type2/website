Subject: front shift rod bushing woes
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a '70 westy that has a sloppy feeling shifter, so I figure time for
new bushings.  I replaced the plastic guide/bushing at the very front right
under the gear shift then went back to the one where the rod enters the tube
a little further back.  The boot was jolly well shot so I pulled that off
and, voila, no bushing there (where I think it should be, right?) So I say
to myself, that might be one reason it's sloppy.  So I read in the archives
about how there should be two indentations on the rod to mate up with the
two bumps on the bushing, but I can't find the indentations!!!  The bus is
in 2nd gear so I'm assuming the rod is as far forward as it should go, and
no indentations.  Am I missing something?  Are the indentations just inside
the tube?  DO I HAVE SOME ROGUE CITROEN OR FIAT SHIFT ROD??!!
