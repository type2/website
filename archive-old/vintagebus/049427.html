Subject: Wanted:63-67 Bentley

I just entered the wonderful world of type2s!  A couple of weeks ago, I
bought a '65 Sundial, in solid, yet rough shape.   I'm wondering if anyone
has a spare Bentley book in the same shape, for not a lot of $$$?  I've
done a lot of work on T1s, but I'm pretty lost when it comes to redux
boxes, and all of that stuff....   I really don't want to spend $95 unless
I really have to.  I don't care if it's greasy and the cover's gone, just
as long as the info is there and it's relatively readable.   I'm looking
forward to getting the bus on the road and doing a bit of traveling.

TIA,

  Josh Cronin
