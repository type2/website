Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Look at this photo please...

You're risht, Type 3's had the larger tins that look 
like this (bad ascii art) from the bottom:
 ________________
/  ____     ____  \
| |    |   |    | |
| |____|   |____| |
\_________________/

While T1's and T2's had the smaller, triangular piece. 
  For those that don't know they fit on the underside of 
the barrels in the space between them, against the case, 
pointy bit towards the head.
  Without one of these the cooling air would flow 
straight down and out, causing the barrels to run much 
hotter. When installed they force the air all the way 
around the bottoms of the barrels, cooling much more 
effeceintly. 

More bad ascii, looking down the cylinders:

without:

|  ,--,  ||  ,--,  |
| (    ) || (    ) |
|  '__'  ||  '__'  |
V        VV        V

With:

|  ,--,  ||  ,--,  |
| (    ) || (    ) |
|  '__' /  \ '__'  |
| |----/    \----| |     
V V              V V

  I believe that all type 1 aircooled motors came with 
one style or the other!

&gt; &gt; I would add:
&gt; &gt; -  potential loss of pickup tube and oil starvation!
&gt; &gt;    Since whoever built John's motor neglected to
&gt; &gt; install
&gt; &gt;    such basic cooling components as air deflectors,
&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt;    you think they took the time to properly install
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt;    sump?? 
&gt; I thought the &quot;air deflectors&quot; (pieces of tin that are
&gt; secured to the bottom of the cylinders) where found on
&gt; Type3's orginally and had to be added to the other
&gt; types. If that tin is original he never had it to
&gt; begin with. The picture is bad but i do see the lower
&gt; tin that attaches to the case and heater box.   
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; -  cost of sump, cost of additional oil at every oil
&gt; &gt;    change
&gt; 
&gt; At less than $2 a quart, and purchase price of about
&gt; $30 for the sump i would say cost is minimal.    
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; -  Oil leaks where the sump mounts
&gt; 
&gt; Blame the mechanic not the sump.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; -  risk of some road debris shearing it off
&gt; Possible but not very likely unless you lower your
&gt; car, and why would you do that anyway. :)
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;   Didn't Kyle have an engine grenaded by one of
&gt; &gt; these??
&gt; &gt; mounting nut sucked into pickup or somesuch?
&gt; I have never heard of that before. It is possible but
&gt; it sounds like a poor assembly job to me. Key word
&gt; LocTite!
&gt; &gt;   If you have a hot rodded, non-stock motor you may
&gt; &gt; need
&gt; &gt; extra oil capacity as the oil could be pumped out
&gt; &gt; faster
&gt; &gt; than it can return to the sump. I run a mild 1776,
&gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; run high revs and check the oil level at every fill
&gt; &gt; up.
&gt; &gt; For my situation the risks and added cost outweigh
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; benefits, YMMV
&gt; I run a stock 1600 in my bus with a full flow system
&gt; and heavy duty oil pump. It's a system that has never
&gt; let me down. 
&gt; By the way if anyone needs a sump i can be reached at
&gt; www. iLOVEVWsumps_dot_com, just kidding. I just think they
&gt; are worth the money.
