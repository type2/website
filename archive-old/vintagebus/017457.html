Friday message- a non-serious rant...

I received an announcement in the mail today from an
auto insurance company that claimed to want my
business. The come-on printed on the envelope was a
REFUND NOTICE!

Inside the envelope was a brochure with a photo of
vehicluar traffic with- yup- a VW Vanagon in the
middle lane. Under the photo was a big headline that
read:
&quot;How More Arizonians
Save Money with the
&lt;Name&gt; Auto Insurance Program.&quot;

The spew went on to spout more details and brag that
it was &quot;from a company you can trust.&quot;

Excuse me! but how can I trust a company from Delaware
that hasn't taken the time to research the proper term
which describes a resident or residents of Arizona?!
No, this is not California, Washington State or
North/South Carolina. Do you call a Texan a Texian? A
New Mexico resident a New Mexician? A Cajun anything
but a coonass? Hell no! Someone call and the tell the
A-holes at Discount Tire to quit marketing that dumb
tire called the Arizonian. I can't imagine under all
but desperate circumstances having four typographic
errors supporting my vehicle. It makes one wonder what
else the tire and insurance folks skimped on during
the preparation of their product/services.
I hear you saying, &quot;Lighten up, VanBondo! don't be
such an anal twit!&quot; Well OK, I don't obsess over anal
units, except after meals of cheap Chineseian food,
nor do I really care- but why should I accept overt
stupidity from otherwise know-it-all business schmoes?
During the tour of duty with my former employer I had
an early morning breakfast meeting with some visiting
out of towner BMF doo-rod from &quot;The Main Office&quot; in
Omaha who started spewing smack about his
Alpha-doggian corporate Zig-Ziglarism, Z-management,
feel good, team building, informal work grouping,
striving for excellence, parachute coloring, Malcolm
Baldridge, successful traits of whatever whomevers,
'Colon' Powell, philosophy, bull-du jour, when he
referred to how Arizonians do this or that. I gently
corrected his error and everyone at the table looked
at me like I was attempting to pass a joint to the
Pope during High Mass at Christmas or something. I
went on to whatever I went on to and he went on to
fame and fortune and is probably still repeating his
error without knowing it. Some things don't matter as
long as you have big- flowchart under you. Oh well,
call Jay Leno for the headline humor but don't call me
an Arizonian.

BTW: Contacted the insurance company's website and the
contact/feedback links did not work. Intended to give
them a touch of what some folks call &quot;Eend user
feedback&quot;. The site is Swoopy-doopy, Flashy, morphing
in and out of transparent layers to beat a drum like
light in afternoon on a lake in late Summer but the
basic usability and primary rationale for the site's
existence failed. Damn, Now that's as distracting as
Madonna's new video!
