Hi, I have searched the archives to see if I could find the answer to my 
question. But, no answer.  Here goes.  I am having trouble splitting the 
reduction boxes on my 60 Panel. I don't want to have to pound these guys into 
submission for fear of doing something I might not be able to fix. Oh yeah, I 
haven't fully removed them off the Arms yet.  Any suggestion? -thanks.

I am assuming the transaxle is on the floor, not in the bus, and you have 
already drained the oil  (if the oil is still in, drain it or you will have a 
big mess)
you have the brakes off, backing plate and all, also the rare axle seal cover 
is off.

when you say they are on the arms, I guess you mean the RGBoxes and tubes and 
attached to the center section.   THis makes sense as you have to take the 
RGBoxes apart before you can take the axle tubes and axles off the center 
section.

so you are just trying to split the RGBox case halves, right?   and all the 
bolts in the RGB  are out?   there isn't a hidden one anywhere?  so At this 
point I use a hammer and a flat chisel- I am not sure what you call it- the 
end of the chisel is flat, not to chisel through something, but to transfer 
the impact to a flat area.  And the RGB halves have lips where you can pound 
them  to separate, just like the little protrusion on an engine case.  So 
rather than mash them directly w/ a hammer, I use the chisel with the flat 
end so as not to mash the thingys.   Hope this helps.

Do you have a copy of the Bentley reprint of the VW Transporter Workshop 
Manual?    I recommend it, it has directions for this stuff.
