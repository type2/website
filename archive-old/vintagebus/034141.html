I just got off the phone with Pickwick about the bus, they took sealed bids
before listing on ebay, the reserve is 4566.00 would be the high bid, they
have a sealed bid at 4565.00 which will buy the bus if the reserve isn't
reached on ebay. I was told that they did purchase the bus new and installed
all the sound system and did all the woodwork in the interior, it still all
works but doesn't come with mikes or cable, but the tape and record player
still do work. It had 12 volt to 120 inverters but they have all bit the
dust and will need to be replaced. This bus was loaned out for parades,
military funerals etc, and it IS the actual mileage, the gentalmen i talked
to use to drive it to events and he has been with the company since 1969. So
somebody buy some of my buses so I can own this, will make a great PA for
Buses by the Bridge V,2001.

heheh...apparently it's higher than the $560 I just bid.

That is sooo cool.
