Subject: RE: [VB] New front window rubber?

&gt; It's time to remove the front windows and crappy seals so I can clean,
&gt; de-rust, POR 15, prime and paint the opening.  Who makes the best fitting
&gt; replacement front window rubber?



Well, here are some listmember comments on my windshield seals, culled
directly from the Vintage Bus list archives...

I got some windshield seals from Bus Depot.  They were
very supple, and fit very well, and I like the way the outside
of the seal lipped over the metal of the bus, laying down flat.
I liked them better than the WW seals; the outer lip of the
seal does not flip down over the metal of the bus as well
as the ones from Bus Depot.

and ...

I ordered a windshield seal a week ago Monday for
Nikki's bay bus from Bus Ddepot..it arrived on that friday
in a very timely manner. The seal installed great and even
impressed the installer

I import these seals directly from Europe; they are not the U.S. nor the
Brazilian made repros sold elsewhere.  They are in stock for immediate
delivery, for $12.95 each.  You can order toll free (part number 211 845
121A), or just click on this link:

Incidentally, I also carry the POR-15, by the quart. I don't get it
factory-direct, so I can't discount it.  Basically I offer it for the
convenience of customers who are already ordering sheet metal or seals from
me, and want to avoid the hassle (and the second shipping charge) of having
to order their POR-15 somewhere else.

Don't forget to request your additional 5% listmember discount if your order
totals at least $50 before shipping.
