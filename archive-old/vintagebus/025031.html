Subject: 65 interior Q's.  Stock

I was going thru all the interior panels i got with my bus.  I was
making sure tha ti have all the trim and what i needed to replace.
Turnes out i have all the trim, but a few questions were raised about
the panels.  My bus is a 65 bench 21 window deluxe.  I got 2 sets of
interiors with it.  One S&amp;P and the other a Tan color.  The divider
panels for both were different.  (The panel that covers the spare tire)
One of them had corners that were rounder then the other.  One was about
3&quot; radius and the other about 1&quot;.  The lower trim piece followed suit.
I also noticed that the large side panel and the smaller panel on the
passenger side were different in shape.

My Question.  since neither interior is original to the bus, which is
correct?  Also, was there a rubber trim piece that went around the top
of the spare tire cover panel?

Thanks
Matthew

Ps.  Anyone have any pictures of the correct interior they are willing
to email me?
