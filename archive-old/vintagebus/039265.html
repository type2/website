Subject: Bus Tow Bar Use Rpeort
Date: Thu, 2 Jul 1998 10:33:41 -0700 

I bought a bus tow bar from Dr Joe at All Bug
last week, just in time to retrieve the bus I bought.
(full bus report sometime next week)  For this point
in the time, let it stand at a '67 Deluxe hardtop.
(as I was leaving to pick up the paid for bus I
learned that a 21 window being driven regularly
may be for sale locally)  I'll have to check it out.

Anyway, I got the tow bar and after scraping
the usual pile of junk together, I headed off 75
mile away.  I borrowed a Toy 4Runner for the task.

It took only a half hour to push the bus out, hook
up the tow bar and run the lights, not bad for a first
time use of this style of tow bar.  When I get the 
photos back I'll ask Everett to post them.

The tow bar hooks up like the bug style in that it
has a &quot;U&quot; that hangs from the lower torsion tube.
Actually it's two angles poking up from the bar,
but it forms a U bracket with a bolt though the top
to keep it hanging from the torsion tube.

It is sized to clear the anti-sway bar and such.
It would be a close fit to the steering damper,
which was disconnected on my bus.  This may 
explain problems I had later.

The U hanger is a loose fit to the torsion tube,
so it can slide around under there, sideways.  At a 
stop to check things I found marks indicating that the 
U  hanger had slid around a lot.  A steering arm could
be tured against the U hanger if the bus turned while
the U hanger was at the wrong spot.  I tied a short
length of rope around the protruding piece of the
steering box (the one that is at the center of the bus,
I don't remember the correct name) to the arms of
the tow bar to keep the bar centered on the torsion
tube.  This worked very well.

The tow bar is fairly narrow, so any looseness between
the U hanger and the torsion tube results in the bus
weaving around when braking.  I heavily suggest 
placing a wooden or plastic shim to tighten up the 
space, yet still allow the necessary rotation.  A wider
U spacing would be better, but the tow bar is sized to
fit loafs also, so probably some compromises were made.

The bus seemed to bounce back and forth during the
trip during braking above 40 mph.  The lack of a 
steering damper could have been the main culprit
here, just don't know.  It coulda slowed down the 
wandering.   I got up to 55, got a little weird, so I kept
the max to 50, usually around 45.

Other than the above, things worked real well.
I have a pair of rear lights from a '64 I have mounted
to an aluminum bar, already wired up to serve as
trailer lights, so in case any one cares, the lights
were the same period as the bus!

The length of the tow bar made parking lot travel
very easy, with no danger of pinching the bus and
tow vehicle.

Good sturdy tow bar.  If you want one for  yourself:
Call All Bug, Dr. Joe, $185 delivered,  602-997-7345
No web site yet.  Took less than a week for delivery.

If anyone needs one in the Sacramento area, let
me know, I wouldn't mind loaning it out.  The tow
vehicle, however, is something you will have to 
provide.
