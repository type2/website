Subject: Re:  Where's Joe Boerio?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Can anyone help?  I had been in touch with Joe Boerio, of JB's Heater 
Service.  Joe seems to be the foremost authority on VW gas heaters -- and 
since I drive a 66 bus year-round in Minnesota, my gas heater is one of my 
vehicle's most important components.  But I've been calling the phone number 
I had for him for weeks -- and getting no answer.  The number I've called is 
303 660 9032.  I called 411 and asked for a number for Joe (I have his 
address).  They said that he had requested it to be unlisted.  Does anyone 
know if he had gone out of business?  Is he sick?  Whassup with Joe?
