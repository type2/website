Subject: Sapphire Radios

Hiya list,
Can anyone recommend a place to send my Sapphire radio to get fixed?  I had
it converted from 6V to 12V a few years ago by Brad Clausen in the midwest,
but I don't think he does radios anymore?  Not long after I had it done, it
started getting a lot of static, and finally gave out all together.  Any
recommendations would be appreciated.

TIA,
Ed
