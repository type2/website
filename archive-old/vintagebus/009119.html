As you all know, I've been totally and thoroughly disgusted with my bus to
the point I haven't worked on it since Saturday and not driven it for twice
as along.  I had no inspiration and or drive left to work on it.  E-mails,
chats, and even support phone calls with Terry Wolfe, Rob, and Dan Kinsey,
didn't reinstill my drive to work on that hunk of crap.  I appreciated and
enjoyed my visits with them but nothing seemed to help me while in my dark
veil of VW doldrums.

And slowly but surely, things started to change. :-)

First off, reading Shawn's post about driving his bus to melt away stress
kind of put a smile on my face.  I met Shawn and Sarah at BNNTA and I felt
as if I met a couple of VW soul mates.  Reading his message kind of steered
me towards thinking of the possibility of slaving at the old flat four
again.  Lately it had seemed the driving my bus caused me more problems and
more stress than the damn thing was worth.

2nd of all is Isaiah and his roached engine.  As bad as it sounds, his
problem helped me to realize that my problems weren't really that bad at
all.  I could have been the one with a rod ready to throw and that is worse
than valves and dual springs any day.  So that gave me a little booster as
well.

Then last night while ICQ'ing (as I had done the past 3 nights), Glen Hadley
of Hamburg, IA pretty much insisted that he come over tonight and help me
out.  It was a 90 mile drive in which he would have to leave at 3 at the
latest, get here at 5:00, help me work on the bus, and make it home in time
to sleep and get up to be at work 20 minutes away at 7:00!  I thought that
was a pretty generous offer of him.  I decided to accept because whether or
not I wanted him to help, he was coming so I had no choice.

Today at work at about 4:45, I'm writing a letter to Joe Cali in the
breakroom and filling out a check for my Next Generation plans when in walks
Glen.  Glen is an engineer of some kind at the nuclear powerplant 70 miles
from here - kind of like a real life Homer Simpson of sorts. :-)  He had
wanted to drive the Subaru but since it was such a nice day out, the 79
Westy was the obvious vehicle of choice.  Anyway, after a quick last minute
delivery, we commenced wrenching on my bus at about 5:45.

The first order of business was to pop the engine lid and show Glen the
works.  Within minutes the fuel pump was removed because it appeared the
gaskets weren't doing a very good job holding back the oil.  With new
gaskets, a little bit of permatex, and a quick education in correct fuel
pump rod orientation (point side down idiot!), we had it mounted in short
order.  Next item of business was the valve situation.  We pawed through my
box of rockers and came up with some adjusters that would work.  Glen wire
wheeled them down and I used some fine emory cloth on the tips to shine them
up.  After some glitches with the bolt on rocker shafts were ironed out, we
got the valves adjusted and slapped the valve covers on.    A test running
of the engine revealed quieter operation and still that nice WEBER induced
smooth idle.

Glen and I packed up the tools and when we were ready to leave, the bus
wouldn't start!  I think I left off the ground strap on the trans - not
quite sure though.  Anyway, I push started Glen and we not only cruised a
little bit, but Iet Glen drive the bus.  He repeatedly commented on how well
that 1776 ran - smooth.  He also liked the way the bus handled.  His
compliments kind of help to build me up a little more.

We hit a local greasy spoon and at 9:45 Glen left to get has and head for
home.  Poor guy won't make it back until 11:45.  I just can't express enough
my appreciation his personal sacrifice in helping me.  Not only is that
horrendous valve chatter gone, the bus runs stronger, runs a little longer
when you shut it down, and there is nowhere as much oil leaking all over the
place.  There is still some but not as bad - seems like the problems are
getting nixed one by one.

So thanks to Glen, I have a running bus again.  I just need to track down
that no start problem...
