&lt;&lt; i have a couple of baywindow heater assist fans layin around, does anyone
 have any suggestions about how to use these in my 66 ?&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Fix your heater system first, and make sure to have all your seals and 
interior panels in place!  We doubt that in Alabama area that you get temp 
much below 40F often.  Here in Washington State with temps above 35F we get 
great heat after about 5-10 minutes of driving.  With windshields defogging 
in less than two minutes.  If you still need more heat install a metal bladed 
squirrel cage fan in the heater duct up inside the front nose belly pan.  
Still not good enough?  Then best of all is to install a Eberspacher or South 
Wind gas heater for instant heat.
 
&lt;&lt;also any suggestions on where to run the crankcase ventilator hose with a 
weber carb? &gt;&gt;
Sure, just hook the hose into the air cleaner.  Eric&amp;Barb
