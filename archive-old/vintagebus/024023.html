Subject: 62 S/C  sold, 61 15 Window F/S

Sold the 62 pickup to Beto in Las Vegas and he should have it running
for the Vegas show in Oct, it sold for $675.00 witch I think was a
steal. Another friend in Lake Havasu has a 1961 15 window for sale. New
1600 motor,paint,brakes,rubber,ect. Biggest thing wrong is they left
the cut rear wheelwells and put those rubber 4X4 flaps on the rear. No
middle or rear seat, all deluxe alum trim there. No computor so call:
520 8553445 ask for Lindsay. Call after 3P.M. Az. time, and B-4 8P.M.
