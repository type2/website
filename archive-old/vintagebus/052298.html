&gt;If you're going to put in a guage or tach go see your favorite
&gt;computer/network guy and get some stranded (not solid!) shielded
&gt;twisted pair cabling.  Most of the stuff laying around is 8 conductor,
&gt;plenty for oil and cyl temps, tach, etc.

I think unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is usually more common than
shielded.  It doesn't really matter for this application, though.
There is a grade called &quot;plenum&quot; cable which has a thicker, flame-
retardant jacket (it's meant to be safely run through building
air ducts) which would probably do even better in a Bus.

One important thing.  The individual wires in this cable are very
tiny - a sample I have here has 24 AWG wires.  Gauge senders should
be OK with it, but don't use this cable to suppply anything that
draws any kind of power (lights, etc).  I think the smallest gauge
VW used for anything was 0.8 mm^2 which is about 18 AWG - four times
the cross-sectional area of 24 AWG.

Eric&amp;Barb (I think) have suggested &quot;trailer cable&quot; if you need to
run a few heavier leads at once.  This is four or more larger wires
(16 AWG - 14 AWG) bundled into a round jacket.  If you only need
three wires, regular stranded power cord will work - try to get
a high-temperature type like HPN.  (The temperature rating will
be printed in degrees Celsius on the jacket.  105C is probably
the highest easily-available rating.)  This is stranded flexible
cord, like extension cords are made from - NOT solid nonmetallic
sheathed cable or &quot;Romex&quot;, UF, etc.

&gt;Use a terminal strip or a spare fuse block at both ends and wire 
&gt;from there to your guages and senders.
