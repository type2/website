Ahhh yes, the feeling of the wind in your hair and bugs on your forehead 
(always wear a hat) I know these feelings well.  And whatever set of Safaris 
you end up with, I think you'll find them worth every penny on a these up 
comming Summer days.  The will leak like damn during the winter, just expect 
it.  Mean, you get your shoes wet walking out to the bus to get in it, 
right??  So a little dampness shouldn't hurt yea.  Besides, usally the 
thought of cruzing thur the summer at full flaps is a pretty good cure for 
damp feet.  My Safaris on my 57' single cab are original VW, and they look 
it.  Hours of sand blasting, priming, filling, and grinding glass (I never 
knew you could grind glass on a bench grinder!!  Kids don't try this at 
home).  But from a rusted pile of frames and hardware, my $200 Safaris are no 
better or worse than anybody elses.  I can run full flaps up to about 45 mph 
and have yet to get hassled by the local fuzz, I and my passengers always 
wear eye protection--this has a lot to do with it.  They main thing is no 
matter how you do it or what you spend.  Enjoy the hell out of them.  There 
is a Delux here in Eugene, that actually drives with them closed!!  Go figure.
   Peace, Love, and no they are not for sale---that is unless you buy the 
truck,
