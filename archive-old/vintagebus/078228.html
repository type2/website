Wow! What an ending! Find a friendly welder and repop a pedal floor
bracket and weld it on. Or go to a vw salvage yard and get the whole
assembly and cut out what you need and have it welded in place.

Congrats on getting all that work done! You've learned a heck of a lot,
and done a huge job that not many folks attempt. Sounds like much of your
shifting problem was due to the floppy rear shift coupler. Did you
remember to run some safety wire (stainless steel wire) thru the holes in
the heads of the shift coupler grub screws and tie them around the shafts
to keep them in when they loosen?

Important tip: If you liberally smear
anti-sieze lube all over all contacting surfaces of all your shifting
assmeblies, all screw threads, as well as your rear stub-axle splines, and
anything else you want to remain removeable ten years from now, they will
not rust up together and cause grief years later. I used anti-sieze on
all my shifter couplings back in 83, and when I took it all apart in 96,
everything came apart like it was new. I use it on all large-nut threads,
etc.
