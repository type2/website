&lt;&lt; Anyone know of a good product to use to prevent corrosion of these 
terminals that is as non-mess as you can get?&gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
You can use Vasolene!

&lt;&lt;Now I wonder what the condition of the terminals are on the back side of 
the fuse block?  I will have to pull the block and check.  I think I'd feel a 
lot better if I could pull all the wires off - one at a time of course, and 
cleaning/protecting them all the same way. &gt;&gt;
Best to have an extra fuse box on hand that you have throughly cleaned.  Then 
as you remove each wire from your old fuse box you juat immeadiatly connect 
each to the new box.  This allows one to not only throughly clean the new 
fuse box, but also allows through checking of all the brass pieces of the 
fuse box.  These brass pieces are spot welded together and very often these 
spot welds over the years have popped apart to make another bad connection 
area to corrode.  To repair these areas just takes some carefull soldering.  
Plus the pre-1961 fuse boxes are riveted together which allows corrosion to 
get in between these riveted pieces and is another good place to quickly 
solder.    Eric&amp;Barb
PS If you had a generator we would say it sounded like a bad regulator or out 
of round commutator.  EEE&amp;B
