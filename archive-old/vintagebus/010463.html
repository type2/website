Well 2 weeks ago i posted a message about my first trip in 10 years in the
old 66, made it about 40 miles up the highway before i lost a rod bearing,
its a horrible sound, makes me cringe, eeeew.  Anyway the next day i pulled
the enginer and remembered that 10 years ago when i put new jugs and pistons
on this engine after i robbed it from a 71 beetle that i had, i overlooked
the small crack in the head due to lack of funding. It probably would have
made it around town for a long time, but not down the highway. So i strapped
it down to a pallate along with a 1700 pancake core that someone
mysteriously left on my driveway 5 years ago, and shipped it off to Action
imports in Louisiana, he gave me 300 for the 2 off  a brand new engine and
another 50 off for using my flywheel , and the new engine arrived Friday!
In the mean time i restored the entire engine compartment army style(if you
cant clean it, paint it). To do this right is very time consuming, and after
2 months on the list my split bus conscience wont let me do it anyother way.
I replaced the rear brakes and hoses cleaned and painted the drums/plates
transfer boxes, replaced the cv boots, tranny mounts, tranny oil.  I cleaned
the tranny with a toothbrush as much as i possibly could, i figure it will
be coming out eventually anyway. I restored the heater tube things and
wrapped them in exhaust insulation mesh. I sanded and painted all the engine
tin(big job), generator, fan, pulleys, gen stand, intake manifolds, air
breather, valve covers, doghouse, hoover bit, muffler , exhaust tubes,
heater boxes, oil filler.  I took the doghouse and the heater boxes down to
the man and had all the seams and extra holes welded up. Removed the gas
tank and cleaned it with hot water and rocks, replaced the filter,
dissasembled the sender unit and cleaned it with a tooth brush , painted it.
i Sanded and por15ed the entire engine compartment, then resanded and
painted it basic blue like the rest of the bus, then i insulated the top
with jc whimpy NASA insulation from the gas tank clips to the engine door.
  *** the nasa insulation can be attatched to the roof with zip ties at the
cross members, and zip ties around the wire clips by the engine door and
aluminum tape on the side by the gas door and battery, this allows easy
removal for whatever reason, but you have to attach the ground wire for the
gas tank to the roof first and poke it through, then attach to gas tank****
then I painted the back , the hatch and the lid.
On assembling the engine i was glad to have the bag of 50 chees screws that
i won on ebay, first time ive ever installed all the cheese. I took
formagasket and completely sealed the engine tin and doghouse. Then i use
aluminum tape where the tin goes up to the block,and on the rear tin . I
went around the heat riser manifold and everything , and instaled a new
engine compartment seal.
So i installed the engine  with no gloves and didnt even get my hands dirty,
got it in there and bolted and realised that i forgot to feed the
accelerator cable through, no problem i crawled under and got my hand as far
in there as i could and the cable slipped out of my hand and went right in
the hole, went around to the rear and there it was coming from the doghouse,
i thought &quot;the gods are with me on the bus today!&quot; , so i grabbed itto pull
it up to the carb and it snapped off in my hands!!!!!! So here i am after 4
solid 12 hour restoration days, gassed up , oiled , perfectly clean and
assembled brand new  air tight engine and ready to go,  and a broken
accelerator cable.

The  moral of the story is that after all that i had to rig up some wire and
eletrical tape and patch the accelerator cable to get back on the road. (oh
and dont forget to feed in the accelcable before you install)
