Subject: [VB] Dual Circuit conversion
Message-ID: &lt;19991114172458.78061.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

This question is specifically for Eric &amp; Barb, but I am posting it to the 
list because I think (hope) it is a relevant question for anyone converting 
over to a dual circuit master cylinder.

In the article from the type 2 library on master cylinder conversion, you 
recommend getting a T connector and a small piece of metal tubing to connect 
the two front brake lines in together, similar to the rear brake lines.  The 
lines then connect to the MC like this schematic:

            I    I
            I    I
            I    I   I
  sender   I      I__I  T connector to rear lines
           I      I  I
            I    I   I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I   I
   sender  I      I__I   T Connector to front lines
           I      I  I
            I    I   I
            I    I

Is there anything wrong with not using a T-connector for the front lines, 
and hooking them directly up to the MC, and only using one sender (since you 
only need one anyway, and the other one just kinda serves as a plug, or a 
backup when the other one fails) Like this:

            I    I
            I    I
to front L  I    I
    ______ I      I_____ to front right wheel
           I      I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I
            I    I   I
   sender  I      I__I   T Connector to rear lines
           I      I  I
            I    I   I
            I    I

This would not neccessitate me finding a T-connector, or an extra sender.  
Is this a no -no?  If so, tell me why, because it seems to make sense to me. 
  Any feedback from the list is welcomed also.

Thanks!
