&gt;anyone have thoughts, or pics on this?

The &quot;Damage Numbers&quot; book at the doc project
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ has a few logo examples, along
with which glass they were used on, starting in section 8, page 41.

I wonder if the peregrine dot in the Sekurit logo might be some kind of
production code for date, plant location, etc.

Christian Figenschou (of ZebraSafari fame) once mentioned that South
African Buses were shipped to that country as parts (completely knocked
down) and used locally-made glass, tires, and batteries, as there was an
import tax based on weight.
