Subject: Re: [VB] Suspected electrical problems ?!?!?!?!?!?!

the John muir book has a really good basic trouble shootingsection.  What you 
did was check that there was power to the coil.  BUt you did not check there 
was none coming out of the coil.   SO do read the Idiot Book, that section 
about air, electricity, and fuel being the three ingredients nesseccary to 
make the engine go.

Sounds to me like a fuel delivery problem, actually.  If you pull the line 
from the tank off the fuel pump does it pour out?    Is this bus been sitting 
a while- is there crud in the fuel filter?  Is there crud in the tank/fuel 
sock (it'll show up big time in the filter if so)  Is it a 61 with the 
reserve switch.  I found you can drive with the fuel reserve in the OFF 
position if your tap is real old- but it''ll choke out- did you hit the 
reserve?   I rebuildt my reserve tap (WW kit) and now OFF is all teh way off- 
the old grommety thing was not so good before.   Maybe the carb could use 
cleaning.

and

grab 
&gt;  a 6 volt coil and some tools.  We then go back to the bus to change the
