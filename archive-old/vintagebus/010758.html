Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repop

See That And Raise One.

My Bus has no seats and everytime I go to a show and look at what people are
using for seats I can't figure out if they have the right ones.  I would
really like to know what types of seats to hunt for.

Shawn-

I have been confused by the seat issue as well.  My 67 21 window 
walkthru has a full width seat, with key ways all the way across. 
That leads me to suspect that it originally had a full length seat 
(making the bus an 8 passenger).  Having said that, I think the seat 
I have is not correct for the bus since the legs and the keyways do 
not line up!  I have been told that 67 middle seats were unique... 
This probably isn't any help to you, but perhaps it will get a 
response from one of the experts that will help us both!

&gt;is this really true? my bus has the extra key ways in the floor for a full
&gt;length seat but they are screwed in brackets not welded on ones.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If that is the case does any one have a 62-63 3/4 middle seat they would
&gt;like to trade for a full length middle seat?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Also my seat if from a standard not a deluxe. I was wondering if anyone had
&gt;the chrome pieces for the grab bar they would be willing to sell / loan me?
&gt;I have been doing custom goldsmithing for over 10 years now and would like
&gt;to make molds off of the chrome pieces so I can cast them in brass and then
&gt;have them chrome plated.
