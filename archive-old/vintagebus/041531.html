I don't know the size right off, but when you buy the tap it should be
specified.  Any competent tool man should be able to help you.  I've found
that many metric taps specify English (or letter or number) drill sizes.

Be very careful when drilling!  The drill will really want to grab and
pull itself in.  Use a variable speed drill that will go very slowly!

Are you sure you really want to do this?  Are you having touble with the
existing studs?  Remember the adage:  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!

&gt; hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My 61 i will be needing to replace the front trans mount on, i figure i
&gt; may as well go ahead and use the 63-67 mount with the beefier studs, but
&gt; that means i'll have to drill the nosecone out to accept the bigger studs
&gt; on this newer mount...
&gt; 
&gt; Since i dont have any metric drill bits, what size of imperial drill bit
&gt; do i use to make this mod?
