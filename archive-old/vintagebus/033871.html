&lt;&lt;  I have resorted to hunting down
 Clara
 online and asking her my &quot;dumb newbie&quot; questions that I could not find
 answers
 to in the archives or on web sites.  She graciously offers advice, and
 never
 once has she told me where to stick it or flamed me for being an &quot;insane&quot;
 VW
 driving young &gt;&gt;person&lt;&lt;.  If only the list could all be like her. &gt;&gt;

          Lyle is out.
