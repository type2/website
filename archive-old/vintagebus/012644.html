Ouch!  Make one _tiny_ little mistake and I get six emails in two hours!

The outer nut is truly 46mm, which translates almost perfectly to
1-13/16 inches.

Another person suggested using a &quot;dog-bone&quot; wrench which is struck by
a hammer, but I tend to avoid these as I don't want to hammer on the
bearings.  A 1-13/16 socket, a slide bar, and a 6 foot cheater should
do the job nicely.  Be sure that the wheel is on the ground, and the
brakes held before you apply torque.

An impact wrench is fine to take the nut off, but do _not_ use it to
put the nut on, even with the torque limiter.  Either use the proper
torque wrench or the time-honored math method: Divide the torque by
your weight, multiply by 12, and measure that number of inches along
the wrench from the center of the nut.  Mark that location.  Put the
wrench on the nut horizontally and apply your full weight to the bar
at the marked point.  Put in a new cotter pin and you're through!
