&gt; Well I got the flywheel off...I took a big pair of plyers and clamped
&gt; them around the hub of the flywheel...The arm of the tranny that goes
&gt; into the flywheel looks pretty straight so I am hoping the tranny is
&gt; still usable....But there is alot of metal  shavings  floating  in the
&gt; area the flywheel was in....now on the back of the flywheel, the side
&gt; facing the tranny, there is a plate bolted onto it. There are three
nuts
&gt; holding three of the bolts in place and it looks like they have been
&gt; rubbing against the tranny case...Is this due to improper shimming of 
&gt; the flywheel?

That plate is the pressure plate of the clutch.  There should be 6
bolts holding it in place.  I don't doubt that there has been some
rubbing, since the flywheel came adrift of the engine and moved
forward to where no flywheel should go.  Any shimming that was done
became unimportant as soon as the flywheel came loose.  As long as
there isn't any major chunks of metal broken off of the tranny case
you should be OK there.  Metal shaving are to be expected in this
instance.

It might be that the other three pressure plate bolts were sheared off
by the same thing that scarred up the other bolts.  You'll probably
find their threaded portions occupying thier holes in the flywheel. 
Not a concern if you are going to replace the flywheel, and probably
not too hard to fix if you are going to have it redrilled.

Did the gland nut (the BIG one at the center of the flywheel) unscrew
or did it break?
