&lt;&lt; Facts:  New 009 &amp; coil, new wires, new plugs. Points checked for gap. Carb 
cleaned, checked and rebuilt. Float level adjusted per specs.  All smog crap 
disconnected.  Carb adjusted per book.  Engine timed properly. Running a 
Delta 10 cam.
 
 It had the typical stumble on acceleration.  Tried the trick of pop rivet in 
butterfly plate with no luck. Rebuilt carb, ran worse than ever.  Took pop 
rivet out and readjusted carb.  Stumble gone, acceleration great and good 
performance.  Mileage appears nominal.  And now it acts flooded when you 
start it when warm or hot and you have to floor it and crank for 5-8 seconds 
to get it started.  That just appeared after the rebuild and elimination of 
stumble. &gt;&gt;
Hi Cormac,
Sounds kind of like the trouble we had for a while that turned out that we 
had too big of idle and main jetting in the carb.  When you cleaned the carb 
you probably opened up the jets to allow more fuel in.   Eric&amp;Barb
