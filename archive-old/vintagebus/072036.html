&gt; I took that side apart and the small black rubber oil seal that goes

&gt; destroyed.

Hi Kevin,
Sounds like you installed that spacer (211 501 303 A &amp; thge earlier 111 501 
303 A) in backwards!!  There is a champhered ID on one side of each of these 
spacers.  This champher must contact the O-ring seal or the result you have 
described is the result.
