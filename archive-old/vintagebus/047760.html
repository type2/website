well,
it seems that after a 10 years of being away, I will be moving back to the 
chicago area with my wife.
The move will be completed by the end of December.
Chicago will get 2 new buses, a 66 deluxe and a 58 15 window deluxe.
area listees feel free to p-mail me so I will not feel out of the &quot;loop&quot;
