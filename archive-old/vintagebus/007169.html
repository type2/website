I am not sure what the &quot;particular vessel&quot; your talking about is made of,
nor of your long term plans, or cost perameters?
Is it metalic vessel? Do you want it cheap and easy and versitile? But not
immersion ,Read on.
Is it plastic vessel? If you want a  permanent installation? this may not be
the ticket... my thoughts on immersion are at the bottom.....

 Using the &quot;easy bake oven&quot; (tm.)  idea,  I took a 100 watt lamp (you know,,
a trouble light) and held it against the outside of the &quot;Tin&quot; drum that
holds my parts washer fluid. I used a long metal spring, bun-gee cord style.
This heats it very well.! no thermostat required, as it just doesn't have
enough joules.
I was happy as it was simple,cheap, easy and safe!

Now I degress......  YMMV     Jamie Rivers  Cold country Canada,,,,, off to
wax my snowboard...big smile!

Still reading?   Have fun :-)
Infact, this can be used for other heating purposes,,, if you Snowmobile /
snowblower / Beetle / Bus wont fire up in the cold temps.. throw the parts
washer heater errr, the trouble lamp, on the engine, close the hood,and
it'll be toasty in the morning.  For those that are futher north,,,, Use a
300 watt lamp..throw a quilted blanket over the hood as well..... some of
those real cold days,, you may just have to light the Hibache BBQ , I'll
save that story for a friday!

To complicate the parts washer circuit:
 you can add a dimmer switch, or a infinite heat control from an stove
burner for temp control.
 This is not really based on the temp of the fluid,, it is a manual way.
your brain says the fluid is too hot,, adjust the heat switch...

If you use the *temp* control from the stove *oven* and place the temp bulb
in the fluid,,, it will have the exact temp feedback and will be much better
heat control,

Or:
You can also use a domestic water heater thermostat, it has to be held
against the metalic vessel like you found it when you robbed the old tank
laying in the laneway. Long metal spring, bun-gee cord style will work

For immersion elements purposes,.,,...  be careful,
Any element that you know GLOWS RED HOT,,, is tooooo hot to use for
immersion,,,  without a good temp control switch!
I think that 100 deg +/- a couple, is plenty hot for parts washing,,,  just
my opinion,,
anything that is made for coffee etc, heats to almost 200 deg,,   keep that
in mind!

If you have an element that has tooo high a &quot;watt density&quot;  you chance
burning the element. Or overheating the vessel it is leaning against,
plastic  containers etc will be damaged.
 Immersion style Water heater elements are not recommended for oils, (I
stated this as others may try this for oil based, rather that water based
fluids)
Watt density is the power per inch of the element,, water can dissapate more
watts per inch than oil can. This means that oils will not remove enough
heat from the element thus burning it, if it can't transfer the heat to the
oil, then the oil can't transfer the heat to the thermostat so the
thermostat won't shut it off.

&gt;Is there any way to electrically warm the water in a particular vessel?  I
&gt;have a harbor freight parts washer, which uses a water-based solition, and
&gt;if I could warm the water, it would be MUCH more effective!
&gt;
&gt;Is there something you can immerse into it to do this?
