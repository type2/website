Subject: MIG Welder (pre-incident post)
Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 01:27 +0000

Hello to you metal-workers!

I am about to learn meself how to weld.  If my work is as good as the grammar in the previous sentence, I'll probably be fine...I just need a couple pointers.

First of all, I have a MIG wire-feed welder that seems to not like driving the wire through.  It looks like the right gauge, and the tensioner is all the way up, but I am not sure if I need to be welding to have it feed when I press the trigger.

Secondly, I could use a brief synopsis of basic welding using this unit.  (Specifically, I am replacing the outer 10&quot; of my cargo floor)

Thanks,  Gene
