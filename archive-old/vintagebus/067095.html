Subject: PNW Oktobugfest Sun 13th in Puyallup, WA

Yes rainy side folks, the wonderful Oktobugfest is a week from sunday (it's 
the 13th)  at the Puyallup Fairgrounds.

Take Puyallup exit from I-5 (from the south  its 127) and go about 10 miles 
till you see teh fairgrounds exit.  It's a the bottom of a long STEEP hill, 
make sure your brakes are in good order.   Excellent swap meet.  Lotsa cool 
buses in parking lot.  show is a bit cheesy, but who cares.  

Think from the north there is another Puyallup exit.

I'll be swapping out of the shiny green/white westy.

Clara
