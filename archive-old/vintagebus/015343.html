Subject: [VB]  Not rolling after 20 odd years (long)

I went to prepare the '67 Westy to be towed home tommorrow, end result -- it's staying up there until some things get fixed, such as having it able to roll :-)

A little background.  The bus has been sitting on the front drums for approximately 20 years -- license plate on the back is dated 1979 :-)  It took me thirty minutes to figure out how to get it off the ground, and another 20 to get a tire mounted (rust in the lug holes).  Immediately I noticed the drum was locked on the passenger's side.  Next, did the driver's side, this one took longer (drum deeper in the dirt) and as would be expected, it didn't turn either.  Rats.  To make a long story short, the only one that turns is the passenger's side rear wheel.  The driver's side rear is locked.  

On to the questions.  What can I expect to have to do to get this thing rolling, just far enough to get it on a trailer?  My situation is that ALL of my tools, parts, and my Bentley manual are with the Kombi in Cleveland.  I pick it up after five months on March 25 (long story).  So I need to know the minimum tooling, parts, and know-how that I may need.  At this point I am planning to have to replace all front bearings and the outer reduction box bearing on the locked wheel.  Other things for sure, but right now I'm only concerned with getting it home, not drivable.  Any help would be greatly appreciated -- I plan to try to bring it home next weekend.

While I was there I poked around of course :-)  When I bought it, I couldn't get under it because it was on the ground.  With the floor jack and the tires, I was able to look at the underside for the first time.  Nice.  The sub-flooring is great, with some rust around the water-tank drain opening and that's it.  Also, I found that the bus has a locking steering column!  It does not work (has a jury-rigged switch for now) but I'd like to get it fixed.  I imagine the electrical portion is bad.  Any help here would be appreciated as well.  The front end seems nice and tight, although I'm wondering if there could be complications from the sitting.  Turns real smooth.

Last, the bus does have the '67-only dual-circuit master cylinder, although the chassis number says it should not.  Is there an option code for this part?  I'd list the codes but right now they are under some ratty shag carpet &lt;g&gt;  The cylinder is probably bad -- I pressed the pedal, it held for a second (yeah!) and then *krunch-thump* (oh).

I'm really happy with it, but I've never owned a vehicle that has sat for two decades.  It should be very educational putting it back on the road, I look forward to it :-)
