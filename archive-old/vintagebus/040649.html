&gt;Also keep in mind that a rev limiter won't prevent overrevving on
&gt;downshifting  This probably lunches more engines than heavy throttle feet.

Actually that's the beauty of this piece.  I dug mine up for my 63 Bus that
the whole shift mechanism was worn out that I was constantly missing shifts
and what not that I was afraid of detonating the motor.   It works on
centrifugal force.  Basically the faster it spins, the closer the weight
swing until it grounds out at a  predetermined RPM.
