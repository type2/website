&gt;        i need some info on swaping my 67 mc for an
&gt; earlier one. on the back 
&gt; side of the 67 master cylinder there is an accordian
&gt; type gasket that is torn 
&gt; up and brake fluid is leaking out. is this piece
&gt; supposed to have break fluid 
&gt; in it, i thought it was just a dust guard. i have a
&gt; replacement master 
&gt; cylinder plus the adapter that they sell in
&gt; california imports. to add to 
&gt; this my front right brake is not working as well as
&gt; the others and ive tried 
&gt; adjusting it a few times. my question is what parts
&gt; will i need to do the 
&gt; swap to an earlier mc. i have the mc and adapter but
&gt; need the resivore and 
&gt; what else?

 Hi.....I have a 67 Deluxe and if you have two brake
lines going into your Master keep it that way is all I
know.If one line should fail...leak whatever...the
other line will stop your bus.There should be no fluid
leaking from the master ..anywhere.I had someone tell
me to adj the brakes at the wheel till the wheel wont
turn very easy then back it off two clicks for all
wheels...that worked fine for me and she stops
straight.  Good Luck
