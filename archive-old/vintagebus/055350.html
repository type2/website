Subject: RE: [VB] two weld q's, one spec to DC

Steve,
You have to drill out every spot weld, uncrimp the edges, straiten it, then
puddle weld it back together. Long process but well worth it in the long
run.
Someone awhile back stated they were making replacement bed panels. If you
are going to remove them you may consider buying replacement ones.
Good luck
Shawn

&gt;    &lt;&lt; the bed of my DC has a side-to-side seam never apparently welded,
but
&gt;leaks and allows a lake in the cargo/rear cab. would i be wrong in having
&gt;this seam welded, or use a more flexible filler since it wasn't welded at
the
&gt;factory? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Steve,
&gt;Best to have that seam welded.  On our 1963 SC we welded all four sections
of
&gt;the bed panels together to prevent future leakage.  Using silicon is not a
&gt;good idea due to flexing of the panels will loosen this sealant up in
&gt;sections and start leaking again.

nice then. thing is i am now entertaining the notion of removing the two
rear (rir) p/u bed sections to remove the BIG divits where the 800 pound
gorillas got comfortable during a tailgate party. can somebody list the
generalistics on how this may be done. heard about it being possible, but
hadn't heard much on the process. much thanks    - steve
