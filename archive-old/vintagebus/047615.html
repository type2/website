&lt;&lt; What should be the correct color of wire to run to a set of ambulance 
fans?  I've checked the diagrams on vintagebus_dot_com but didn't find them 
listed anywhere.  Also, where is the best place to tap into power for them.  
I know in the past, someone mentioned running a wire from the interior light 
but if that is switched on and off from the switch near the steering wheel, 
it would look kinda stupid to have the light on when you wanted air!&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Black is what we have and there is a fuse holder at underdash level.  Just 
check the wiring diagrams at Thom's web site for which place to hook it up to 
the main fuse block.
 
 &lt;&lt;Oh, and while we're on the subject of wire colors, the diagram shows the 
wire to the interior light as kind of an orange or brown color... since the 
wire goes from the switch to the light and then to ground, should it be 
brown... isn't brown the color of a ground wire? Thanks &gt;&gt;
It should be a reddish color.  Maybe you need to adjust your monitor color 
levels.....
