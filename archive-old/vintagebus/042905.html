If you have a daily driver, as close to stock as possible is the only way
to go!  I'm in the process of building a 2110cc for my non-daily driver
'56 bug and would love to have those CB performance heads.  What I'm
trying to say is that seems like way too much head for a 1776cc.  I built
a 1776cc a couple years ago with bone-stock heads and that was the
strongest-running engine I've built so far.  I followed the articles in
HotVWs awhile back entitled &quot;Building the Ultimate Daily Driver
Engine.&quot;  It was a three or four part series and was really
detailed.  It sucks that you have to pull you're engine again, but I don't
think you should blame it on the list.  Good luck!
