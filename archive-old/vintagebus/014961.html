Subject: The 411/412 Mystery
Date: Thu, 27 Jan 2000 07:54:06 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

El Listo:

An old man in my area is ready to sell his 411 soon for only $150.00.  From 
what I hear, it is a real cream puff and has probly never been driven over 
35 miles per hour.

I am sort of interested in this vehicle, but does anyone know who is selling 
parts for these thing? Stuff like window rubber and lenses seem to be 
non-existent.
