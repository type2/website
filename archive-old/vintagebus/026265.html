Buy a decommisioned police/sheriff car from an auction and park that in
your drive.  For all your neighbors will know you are a later day Frank
Serpico and you just might bust their sorry middle class asses for
smoking reefer in their &quot;private&quot; back yard hot tubs!  I park a '90
Caprice Sheriff's special in my drive! A nice $1,000 drive...
