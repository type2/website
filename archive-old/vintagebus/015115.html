Does anyone know if this hazet wrench originally came in a vw toolkit (the
round box one)? It is FS on ebay under auction 256079635.

I am inclined to say no but maybe others know better.

Second if anyone is interested in DIN 895 metric wrenches that would work on
your old bus please p-mail me- i think i may have lead.

Michael
