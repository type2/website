&gt; I have a 65 bus with a Saphire I radio. The radio

&gt; terrible.  I can still hear the radio, its just
&gt; annoying (the static that is).
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a grounding issue with either the radio or the
&gt; wiper motor?  Which?  Or is this just the way things
&gt; are in the bus world?

Mine does it too.  You might try routing the RF to ground via a .01
microfarad disc capacitor (cheap, at Radio Shack) connected between the
power terminal on the wiper motor and ground.  Keep the leads short.
