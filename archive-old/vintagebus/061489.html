Subject: Re: [VB] Westfalia Interior 66 year model-Paint

Sorry, but I do not have any formula. I had Home Depot paint department color
match a part that I had. I took one of the big plate/bracket chingi &lt;scientific
labeling&gt; that mounts to the stationery bench part of the SO42/44 Zbed and hand
it to the color match schmoe. In 1993-5 some folks in the USA were still
legally able to put paint in rattle cans. I now would advise having the paint
matched at your choice of locations and either use a compressor powered spray
gun or look into the glass jar and compressed air can set ups for small jobs.
Even with primer and proper prep expect this piece to get scuffed and become
bare metal in a heartbeat. Otherwise have all items to be that color
powdercoated, if you so choose, for potential better wear.
Later,
Jim (I use 'close enough' color rattle cans from Pepboys) Ellis\
