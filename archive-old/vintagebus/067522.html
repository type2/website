Subject: BBB 7- trip  Gossip Retort-semi long

Made it back home to Salt Lake Monday evening after a great 1250 mile r.t.
to BBB7. 

Posted some pics on the samba, but took a lot of pics that are too big to
post, so will have to cut some down &amp; send em later.

Wunderbar campout/site.  Ronnie &amp; the crew outdid themselves again!

Lots of cool buses, but what's w/ those volks in the Vanagons? I had to take
my 84 Westy, cuz it was the only one running, so took listee Curt Conklin
along as a decoy to deflect flames, &amp; still had a great time. grin

Met Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ellis/Beto in the Vanagon/EV section, &amp; am worried that
fatherhood/age has affected Jim's style? Wonderful family tho, so all is not
lost!

Camped next to the Terrible Two section, &amp; was disappointed that they had a
very genteel cocktail party gathering &amp; no mosh pit.

Checked out Rachel's new paint job, &amp; watched John work on his DUAL PORT
motor in the 56 Westy!  I did see a complete 36 hp motor for sale that john
could have installed!

Saw George working away on the quest to reach intelligent life in outer
space w/ his ham radio, Fresno/Sacto Harry winning everything again, but
missed talking to both of them because we lived in different parts of town?

Really enjoyed seeing Greg Noble's 55 Westy w/ full length westy rack, etc.
Where does he get all this stuff?

Met Scott McWilliams &amp; Greta. Greta is the easiest girl I have ever met.
She'll roll over on her back and stick her tongue out to anybody!

Traded a pre-fit/broken in DC tilt to Andy from Yuma for a sweet rack for
the 63 DC, but other than that I behaved myself in the splurging dept.

Took some measurements on P &amp; C's new bay DC for future tilts.  It's 4&quot;
longer than the Split DC! I had put a bay tilt on my 63 DC &amp; it fit
great(must have shrunk a bunch over the years).

JP and crew were situated in the &quot;quiet&quot; part of town(so I was told) but
there still seemed like a lot of action over there.

Somehow, missed the polarbear thong sumo wrestling, but did see some of the
thongs later &amp; was glad I was able to shelter the Brethren from them.

Brought back a tranny from Ronnie that Curt bought, or at least we stole one
out of Ronnie's truck in the campsite! Let me know Ronnie if you are missing
a tranny?

Took Curt on the Bataan Death march on the way back to Utah. Hiked into the
hot springs outside Boulder City for some moonlite hotspringing, got lost
walking out in the dark, &amp; spent 40 years or at least 2.5 hours wandering in
the desert wondering the meaning of life/will we ever eat/sleep again?

Probably one of the nicest venues/low key bus get-together/weather events
I've been to.  Congrats/thanks to Ronnie/John/Jim Bell/VTOtacos &amp; everyone
who worked so hard to make our stay so enjoyable.
