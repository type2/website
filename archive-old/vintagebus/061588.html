&gt;Yeh, mines not wavy thankfully. But those dents in the ridges. What 
&gt;did you do about those? I don't want to use filler 'cause I'm gonna 
&gt;actually use the truck. 

My philosophy was the same as yours - my truck gets used, regularly.  So
you know what I did with those waves and dents?  Nothing.  I threw some
paint on it and called it good.  :)  Here's how it looked after paint
(purists need not bother):

And the &quot;finished&quot; truck, not perfect, but nice and still usable:
