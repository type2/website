Subject: Re: [VB] tool source

&gt;&gt; &gt; I purchased my tourqe wrench and 46mm from sears(craftsman). You can
&gt;jump up
&gt;&gt; &gt; and down on stuff till it breaks if you want they still take it back(the
&gt;&gt; &gt; stuff with a lifetime warrenty read the fine print) no questions asked.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;ther is always several craftsman vendors on ebay selling sockets , wrenches,
&gt;etc , really cheap,  do you have to have a reciept for the craftsman
&gt;warranty for sears???


NO, the receipt is not needed.

I've looked for Craftsman tools on Ebay before, but the prices seemed high
to me.  Maybe I'd better look again.
