Subject: '60 Panel Resto - Bought the Paint
Mime-Version: 1.0


I bought the paint today.  1 1/2 gallons of &quot;PPG Concept 4 CLV&quot; and all the
fixin's.  

$515 and change.  

Will the person who said &quot;painting a bus yourself is cheap&quot; please step
forward?  I'm well over $1000 in just paint and body materials, ie filler,
primer ($50/gallon) sandpaper, etc.

My original plan was to *order* it this weekend, with thoughts of picking
it up *next* weekend, but they were having a slow day and mixed it up right
there.  On the plus side, since they did have some lag time, I got to
discuss paint technology and technique with them.  That was worth it right
there!

It's going to be yellow.  It's hard to describe the yellow, but it's muted.
  I was this &quot;&quot; close to getting Chartruese (sp) like on the fire trucks...
