   &gt; I get some backfires when using engine braking. Timing? Carb?

   Check the timing first, then check for intake and exhaust leaks. Carb can
   affect it too, but is less likely.

i have had similar problems with my bus, when driving on the highway...if i am
going around 55-60mph then let off the accelerator i often get a pretty loud
backfire.

This has happened even aftre adjusting the timing...i have noticed that if i
pop the bus out of gear(ie push in the clutch while letting off the gas) the
bus doesn't backfire.

perhaps i don't have the timing set correctly. i haven't checked for intake or
exhaust leaks. By this do you mean leaks at the valves?

thanks for any more suggestions
