Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

Hi Robert,

It's always nice to see progress of your project.

The double cab headliner is in 4 pieces... the front three are just like
those for a single cab and then there is a large piece for the rear.  My
double cab was missing the large rear piece but I have since found a
restorable one.  I'm still looking for nice rear compartment panels for
a 59 double cab if anyone should have some spare originals.


Happy new year
David
