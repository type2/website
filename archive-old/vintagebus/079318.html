Subject: Re: 63 Oz bus and twin cab trivia

Ya, although the one ton set up is listed as an 'option' for the US, It seems 
that most here have it.   though over the years pieces do get switched 
around... I haven't dug into my 63 rat sc yet, but it has a late dust cap on one 
front axle and an early on the other, little nut tranny, and no one ton m code.  
Does it have one one ton spindle on it with matched brakes, or mismatched 
front brakes?   who knows what has been swapped?  not I !!!  stay tuned for an 
update (but don't hold yr breath)

re taillights... I thought the flatter housing were earlier and the fatter 
were later...  changed in 63?   64?   definately pre 67, as the 68-71 had the 
stylee buildt in ground.  

progressive refinements say:   nothing

63 ed. parts list say:  
 the round glass style bulb holder is  211 945 237B
the us spec (M24) 62 on bulb holder: 211 945 237K

no mention of left or right

Read between the lines:   Actung!!! this is from a 63 edition book. It lists 
what was FS at the dealership when it was in use.  Some p/n s are superceded 
by later edition of the parts.  If I had access to the 61 edition more clues 
might fall into place.    

now there are a lot of letters between B and K.  

 J is the euro (bulbholder for 2 tone lens)

that leaves C through I unaccounted for.    7 taillight light styles.

Well,

After hitting a pair of the 'one ton' spindles
(early pre-63 20mm link pins, later post 63
king pins and spindles) on my twin cab I came
across another pair on another 63 bus. And another
pair on another 63 bus...
