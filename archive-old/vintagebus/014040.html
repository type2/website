&gt;could you answer some of my questions?&gt;

&gt;drive i am looking for a splitty.  fourtunately i've been given around
&gt;£4,000 by an aunt. could you point me in the direction of a decent place to
&gt;start looking for one?&gt;
&gt;also, how much does it cost and how easy is it to lower a 
&gt;splitty's&gt;suspension?
&gt;&gt;cheers,&gt;Thom Airs, Oxford, England&gt;
