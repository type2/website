In light of all of this knob talk, I thought I'd ask a knob question too -- I
have a 66 deluxe, but it didn't have the original shifter in it when I got it.
 I found a '64 didn't fit it because the stalk under the ball was too short.
So I tried a '70.  Fits great, but an ivory knob that would fit on the '64 is
too small (in thread size) to fit the '70 shifter.  I have never seen a '66,
and I know a '67 is like a '70.  Does a '66 shifter have the &quot;small&quot; thread
size, or is it like a '67 (or a '70)?

they changed the shift linkage just into the 66 model year so like you found
a 64 shift stick wouldn't work.

re ivory /grey.

the ivory knobs are sort of french vanilla icecream colour,

the grey just barely a hint of grey.

not sure when they switched to grey from ivory but believe it was before 64.
