Subject: Noise/clatter

1967 bus, 1600DP Dog-house

Symptom:  Loud engine clatter under load and at high RPM in any gear.

I have been having the same problem lately with my &quot;61 panel, 1600 DP. The
noise usually occurs at higher rpm in 3rd and acceleration in 4th then goes
away at cruise speed (60 mph). The front mount on my tranny is in bad shape
and I am going to replace it. The noise sounds more like a vibration noise
(metal on metal) midway under the cargo floor. I haven't located the cause and
am still looking.
