Subject: Re: [VB] My current project

The lift is actually pretty stable.  I tried rocking the bus when it was 
on the lift, and it didn't want to move much.  Once it goes in the pit, 
I'm going to fab up an 'outrigger' setup that will tie the lift platform 
to the slab.  Basically I'll raise the lift all the way, set the outrigger 
under it, then settle it down 1/2&quot; or so.  

I think a full pit would be a waste of money for the home mechanic doing 
oil changes.  There's not much else you could use it for other than oil 
changes, and the expense and liability would pay for a lifetime
of JiffyLube oil changes and even a few blown motors when they forget
the drain plug.

&gt; Interesting thread... I like the lift, but share concerns about safety as
&gt; with any lift or jack. Also, it seems the ceiling and trusses would have to
&gt; be quite high.  I have always envisioned a sort of narrow stairwell/trench
&gt; or 'cellar' in my garage floor like some of the oil-change shops use. All
&gt; poured concrete and the bus stays at floor level but you walk underneath it.
&gt; It'd need a heavy steel cover so the floor would all be flush when you are
&gt; not under the bus. This way, no falling busses and no need for an
&gt; excessively high ceiling. I'll still take the lift though for brake/wheel
&gt; work!
