Subject: Leaky cylinder....  gasket material type?
Message-ID: &lt;370AD1B9.1C7DFC70_at_mcn_dot_org&gt;

Hi all-

I have a pretty significant oil leak comming from between the number 3
cylinder and the case.  What type of liquid gasket material should I use
to solve the problem?  I've seen gasket material in this location before
on other engines thus the reason I'm going this direction....

Thanks in advance,

Gerald
