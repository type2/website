Subject: RE: [VB] gas tank divider plates and gaskets...

Thanks for looking... Actually Ronnie said he was going to take his camera
to OCTO and go around to all single and double cabs and ask to take a

... ah, the power of a support community!
Thanks all.

Don't know...the seat is installed and I've got a bunch of junk under
there.  Can't see it right now.  I'll check on Sunday at OCTO.
