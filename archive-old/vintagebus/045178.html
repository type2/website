I bought a 66 Kombi and I've been having all kinds of fun getting it on the
road. I've raised the spring plates (It was lowered) and replaced the rotten
axle boots. I'm still having electrical problems.

The battery fell out in transit. I've put another in, natch, but I'm getting a
generator light. There is a cluster of wires near the battery that are just
hanging out. Is there supposed to be a wire from the + battery terminal
directly to the Voltage Regulator (mine's mounted on the firewall behind the
oil bath air cleaner) or is this connection made via the solenoid?

Eric and Barb, are you there?
