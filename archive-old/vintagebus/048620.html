At first didn't understand what you trying to say until another listee
explained it to me (just call me slow).  I don't know if there is a magical
number, but if I were as lucky with the ladies as I am with busses, I'd
have to change my name to Hefner!!  And I would be a whole lot wealthier!
After all, it might be fun to run around in a bath robe all day :)

Maybe we should start a list:  why busses are better than sex!


&gt;I've noticed over the course of many messages that you have 35 buses parked
&gt;around your farm.
&gt;I also remember you writing that your wife left some time ago.
&gt;How many buses did you get before she left?
&gt;I have three now but could probably find some more.
&gt;thanks
