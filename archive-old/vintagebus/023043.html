Subject: maybe there are deals on ebay
Mime-Version: 1.0


This went for an incredibly low price!  I normally see people asking
$1200-$1800 for these!  There was one at the classic for $1500.   I was
watching it, but didn't feel the need to buy another one.  Maybe I shoulda
stepped in and bought a &quot;spare&quot; - this one would be more &quot;correct&quot; for my '54.
