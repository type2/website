Saw in the movie ad for &quot;Girl, interrupted&quot; (coming out soon), what appeared
to be red and white standard with American bumpers ( flashed real quick.)
Showed a rear view of them drivin it down the highway at night with small
taillights blazin. Somethin about they go on a road trip or move somewhere
with it.
Regardless of the splitty, it looks like one of those movies thats gonna go
straight to video :)
