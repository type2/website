Snip 
&lt;&lt; I -must- get my
water seperation system in because the air is so moist it makes for spotty
blasting and I end up having to unclog it from time to time(which is a
lot!).&gt;&gt;

Don't forget to open the drain valve on the bottom of the tank at least once
a day. This shoots out all the moisture that has built up inside your air
compressor.  Also what helped me out a lot, was a in-line filter which takes
the water out of the air stream. You can pick one up for a few dollars, and
save a few headaches too!
