&gt;Don't forget to disconnect the thermostat! &lt;G&gt;

I haven't had a thermostat on an engine (or seen one) in so long I 
completely forgot about that! Thanks for reminding me that these are out 
there.

Additionally, this trick works best for non doghouse.

Oh yea, I suppose I should, and have been thinking about, replacing the 
thermostats on all my engines.

Jason
