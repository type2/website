&gt; &gt;I never run it over 4K for anything other than &gt;emergency maneuvers.

&gt; You mean like getting up on the side two wheels or pulling a 360 in traffic? HAHA
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Emergency Maneuvers&quot; gives me a mental picture of some kind of barrel roll or other turn'n'burn kind of &quot;Top Gun&quot; maneuver.

Well, I would if I could!  No, I mean like 7AM LA traffic drop to second
and floor it to avoid having to hit the brakes and cause an accident
type of emergency maneuver.  Or like having a mad illigial alian truck
driver running up my ass at 75mph I have to go as fast as him to get out
of his way emergency maneuver!  

Life, commuting in a 62 DC.
