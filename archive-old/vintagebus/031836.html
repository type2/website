There is also a place called South Bay Chrome (in the LA area). This place
also does bumpers and is the largest Chrome facility in the western U S.
Most plaiting shops will strip and prep the parts then take them to S B for
the copper, nickel then chrome dip. Chrome plaiting is like painting, it's
all in the prep. A good shop will strip the part, polish it then copper dip
it, then polish again, dip in copper again etc. etc.. After this process is
done it goes to nickel, polish again then to the chromium tank. I was walked
through this process at the above named shop years ago as I was getting a
lot of replating down way back when. These guys were excellent on cast pot
metal parts, like wing vent latches and door handles. The problems I found
with these parts is that if they aren't stripped right they will melt and/or
change shape. So don't shop price, shop QUALITY and pay the price, a lot of
times it's cheaper then replacing those outside door handles and Westy tent
mounts.

I used, and have been told, that Christensen's is the best.  All I know is
my chrome came out bitchin.  They're phone # is (323)585-8730, located in
Vernon, CA which I think is the same as Downtown L.A.
