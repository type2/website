&gt; If an idle speed produced by bypass screw is insiffcient for an engine with
&gt; this cyl volume and cam profile, does that entail I need more air AND fuel?

Hi Al,
Not at idle or any RPM less than 1,500 or so.  Sounds like you need a smaller 
pilot jet for leaner idle.

&gt; Could a 30/31 be too small to be ideal? I am strongly considering that a 
&gt; larger air correction jet is in order, perhaps to allow for larger jets as 
&gt; well.  Is the stock aircleaner too limiting?  Is the stock aircleaner too 
limiting?  


Not for a 1600cc run below 4,000 RPM.  The air correction only begins 
operating at mid on up through the higher RPMs.  We are running a 1641cc SP 
with 40 HP air cleaner with no problems.  We just use 20 Wt to keep the oil 
thinner in the cleaner in our cooler climate.

&gt; Does the 30/31 Bocar/Brosl produce the correct vac signal for the later
&gt; samll can Bosch dizzy that is still available new? Ie, is the vac signal 
&gt; the
&gt; same as a PICT 34?
&gt; Will an ENGLE 100 cam produce enough vaccum for the carb to run the signal
&gt; to this dizzy, or should I remain on my 009?

Good questions!  The only way to find out would be to install the vac dist 
and check with an adjustable timing light and tach.  With any old distributor 
and even with the new junk ones this is a needed test to make sure they 
function properly.
