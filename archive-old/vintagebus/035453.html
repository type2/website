Wes,

I recently finished my 72 bus seats.  It is best if you can get the metal 
rods from the old covers, and put them into the new ones.  I reused the old 
ones on mine and it worked great!  You could probably cut and shape a wire 
coat hanger to fit in as well.  If not, you will have to use hog rings with 
the hog ring pliers and attach to the underside of seat or on the springs.

Good luck,
Rob :-)
