Subject: Westy Cot identification
To: Vintage Bus List &lt;Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I picked up a childs Westy cot somewhere in the past
and never used it because it was a Bay window model.
Tired of it hanging around the garage I put it up on
Ebay. I knew that Split and Bay cots are different,
but a interested party emailed me asking if it was for
a early Bay or a late Bay. Hell, I didn't know there
was a difference!  

Hopefully someone can help me to identify it. I
measured the length of the poles and they are 56 1/4
inches long. The poles are round and painted black.
The end pieces are welded on. The fabric is the khaki
canvas.

TIA
