Hello Everyone

I would like to know if anyone out there has a bus newer than mine?

Someone Wrote:
I searched the vintagebus registry for '67 year, then copied the model
numbers to Excel and sorted ascending. According to my calcs, the oldest bus
listed is model #247 147 515 (July '67) submitted by Eric Lykens, CA. This
would be only 994 buses away from the number you listed(217 148 459).
