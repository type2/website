Subject: RE: Two Wheel 1950 Camper

I did take some photos of the camper--they will be back on Tuesday--You may have to talk
Magoo into scanning them in so i can send them to who-ever is an interested buyer--BUT--I
have seen the camper--If you really want a deal--do not wait for the photos!! It should be
sold by then-- It is an all metal camper--on the one side there is a slight seperation of
the panels--all that is needed is pushing them back into place--No Dents or Rust that i
could see, tires are great--Window in front and sides--as you walk into the camper --right
rear--you have the stove --sink --and frig--then a closet-in the back of the camper-under
the stove there are cabinets--There is Plenty of room inside to build more !!Inside of the
camper there is walking room side to side and front and back--Lots of room--9' long 6' 3&quot;
tall
$1500!!  how can you go wrong?  480-488-3655  ask for Sandra--
