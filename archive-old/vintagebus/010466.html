With all due respect to the esteemed ARNOTT clan, I'm betting my wooden leg
that it's actually an ARNOLT blower.

And to complicate things further, Arnolt was an importer and distributor of
all sorts of peculiar machinery.  Some of the machines were, in fact
automobiles.

But Arnolt didn't actually build anything, so the question remains...  Who
designed and manufactured &quot;Arnolt&quot; superchargers?  Were they perhaps a
European unit badge engineered to be &quot;Arnolt&quot;?

Who knows what evil lurks.....
