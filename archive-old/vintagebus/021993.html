&lt;&lt; Hey All,
 I am getting ready to have the Westy painted and have a question.  Were any 
 67 westies two tone? All of the original paint ones I have seen were single 
 color.  If there were two tone westies, what were the available colors?  
 Thanks for all the helpful advice.
  &gt;&gt;
usually the wetsys were made from kombis (at least the 64 and later ones) and 
were thus one colour.   However, they were occasionally two tone.  Seem to be 
the standard colours from micros of that years.  my 65 westy is origanally 
velvet green/bluewhite, so when I painted it (was metallic blue badly done 
when i got it) I went to the two tone original colours.  It also came with 
two tents (now missing, anyone have extras?) and steering lock and safari 
windsheilds, but ordered for US specs with individual codes, not the blanket 
US spec code.   I have seen a blue and white 67 in a junkyard, was an so - 
44, with ambulance fan and steering lock, and clock origianlly!! wish I knew 
about M codes then, I'd have snagged the tag.  Seems the two tone westies 
were usually euro models (mine was sold in Germany) and tend to have come 
with extras.   I have seen a 66 or 67 (forget now) deluxe hardtop which was a 
westy- original from factory, the white over white - very unusual.  The US 
sold ones were shipped over pretty standard, you would have to order these 
things like two tone paint and pay more, and wait till it showed up, AFAIK.
