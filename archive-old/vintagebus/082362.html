 Hi Volks- your treasurer here.... The Vintagebus/type2 list wealth of
 knowledge and advice has and will continue to be FREE to all, worldwide. The
 lists are supported thru your donations to pay for bandwidth. We have enough
 money in the treasury to pay for 4 more months. SEND MONEY to keep these
 resources available. donate_at_type2_dot_com  The lists have spawned many of the
 regional clubs that you all now enjoy such as the Full Moon Bus Club, the
 Ohio Valley tribe, etc. In the last 2 years times have gotten harder and
 money is tight, I know as donations have fallen off dramatically. PLEASE
 help to keep this resource available. Ted (PS A special thanks the Karl for
 sending out parts and requesting a donation to the lists. However, would all
 those who have received parts please send in your donations. The amount
 doesn't matter. Some people have, some people haven't..... Ted)
