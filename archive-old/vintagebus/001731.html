I purchased a middle seat from a guy in Canada thinking I would build my
next bus around it (seeing how hard it is to find a middle seat).  I also
bought it because it has a grab handle and is the type for a walk thru
(2/3 - 3/4? length).  Can the list tell me if this seat is correct for a '63
deluxe.  The grab handle has black end caps and a black center piece.  Does
this seat come from a Kombi?  The middle seat I currently have in my '63 is
missing the grab handle and I am not certain that it is correct.  What types
of middle seats were made?
