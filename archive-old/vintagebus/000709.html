Hi Volks,
We definitely agree!  Our first attempt at rebuilding an engine ourselfs 
years ago resulted in no oil pressure at idle.  Turned out the German 
bearings vacuum packed to the factory cardboard with printed measurements was 
packaged incorrectly!  All we got for our troubles was a new set of bearings 
for free.  So measure everything or risk having to rebuild very soon after.
