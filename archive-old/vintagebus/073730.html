Subject: Rich smelling 30/31

I'm running a new 30/31 on a single port 1600 with a stock air cleaner
and exhaust.  It came with a 120 main and not sure what the idle jets
were.  I've dropped down to a 112.5 and it seems to run the same but
with better mileage.

The problem is that it still &quot;smells&quot; rich.  I don't have a EGA device
to measure the exhaust, but it still seems to rich to my nose.  Timing
is correct, what else should I check/change.  One more thing is that is
has a very mild (according to Ronnie) cam in it so it does lope a small
amount at idle.

Any ideas?

Steve
