for years i have use a 50 caliber ammo box, govt/army surplus ,  to carry
most of my tools, it fits perfectly and tight in the engine compartment on
the left side extra battery tray area, it is waterproof and all that, i got
mine at the flea market for 5 bucks, i just ran accross one at
northerntool_dot_com for only 6.99, but of course the shipping is 8 bucks as
well , im sure any army surplus store would have them too

just a tip, please dont post the next one that shows up on ebay to the list!
