Subject: Re: steering Box!

&gt;From: &quot;Eric Lykens&quot; &lt;elykens_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I just received a steering box out of a 65 bus that is from a company
&gt;called Ross (pn: 6222010139). Is this a common steering box or one of those
&gt;rare after market companies that made steering boxes.

A quick Google for 'ross steering' shows several applications of Ross
steering boxes on heavy trucks, buses, big RVs, and (oddly) older garden
tractors.

I personally have never heard of a Ross-made steering box on a split or
a bay but that doesn't mean they don't exist.  ATE (Teves) and ZF
(Zunradfabrik Fredrichshaven) are the ones I have heard of, but again,
I haven't heard that much.

&gt;One other thing is there anyone selling the steering box gears to 
&gt;rebuild these.

You might ask around at places that supply big truck/bus/big RV parts -
give them the Ross part number and see if they have any leads for you.
