Subject: Re: Are anti-sway and camber comp worth while?

&gt;I am going to be reassembling the 64 soon and I was wondering if it was
worth
&gt;it to install an anti sway bar in the front and a camber compensator in the
&gt;rear?  I intend to use it as a daily driver.


Yes, it is worth it, that's why VW did it on the later splits. They never
did anything just because. I put an aftermarket anti-sway bar on Rosie ('63
Crewcab). It is much larger than the stock bars on the later splits. It
makes a
BIG difference in the cornering. Not all that hard to install with the
urethane bushings and screw-type clamps.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Is the camber compensator for the back better than a rear anti-sway?
&gt;


Because of the suspension geometry on a swing-axle bus, you can't put an
anti-sway bar on the rear, it restricts the up and down motion, at least
until something breaks.
