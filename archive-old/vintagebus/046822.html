 In any case, I had someone put a &quot;are you interested in selling&quot; note
 on it the other day.  I'm not, but thought I'd be nice and tell him
 so, rather than just ignore it.  We eventually got around to the
 subject of how much I'd spent for it, and he expressed complete
 disbelief that it was $5,000, and that I'd blue-booked it (well,
 antique-vehicle'd it) at $12,000 - $20,000.  Now, this bus is in the
 best shape I've ever seen in an unrestored vehicle, so $5,000 seemed
 fair to me.  This guy claimed that he buys and sells VWs all the time
 in the area, and he's never gone anywhere near that much for one.  My
 suspicion is that he was trying to convince me to lower the price
 (which I wasn't going to do, because I wasn't going to sell it
 anyway).
 
 The question is, which of us is hallucinating?  I'm in northern
 Colorado, FWIW.

I wouldn't feel bad for paying that much for a nice low milage early  9 
seater splitty.  I would prefer a turquoise/green 61-64, but that just my 
taste in colours.   It's not like it was a roach coach. the milage and un 
molestedness does make a difference, I think so at least.   Maybe he *was 
trying to get a deal.  Enjoy your bus!!!!
