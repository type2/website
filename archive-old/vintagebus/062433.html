&lt;&lt; is the parts diagram
 &quot;30 pict with vacuum advance manifold&quot;
 the correct deal for a 64?
 211 129 613b and associated doodads.
 How about a picture or drawing of it in place?

If the bus has no bracket welded to the roof of the engine compartment, you 
use the triangle bracket that attaches under the coil, the metal tube that 
goes from the carb and bolts to the triangle, and the oil bath that clips to 
the metal tube.  It has an air flap and a 1&quot; inlet for the pre heat

If the bus has a bracket on the roof of the engine compartment on the left, 
it came with the larger (1500) air cleaner with the breather spout on the 
right.

If the bracket is on the roof on the right, it came with the 1500 air cleaner 
with the breather spout on the left of the oil bath.  at the time most were 
on the left, buses that came with eberspachers had them on the right

I meant to make a web page about air cleaners and why pre heat is so groovy, 
but haven't yet.
