rob...

I found some aircooled diesels for spinach-harvesters, fire trucks, and
airplanes... check the links below...
for a *fraction* of the cost of one of these, you could retrofit your bus to a
watercooled vw diesel with an off-the-shelf Kennedy adapter kit... something to
think about.
I was thinking of Kohler engines, first, but they only go up to near 26 hp or
so... and they are also very expensive.
I'd keep an eye out for affordable raw materials for converting your bus...
classified ads, wrecker lot auctions, and city/county impound lot auctions... to
name a few.
good luck....

&gt; Please, no flames... Does anyone know of an air cooled diesel engine that
