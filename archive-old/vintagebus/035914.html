Why is it that as Thom put it &quot;Free Speech&quot; is a thing of the past?  Are we 
not allowed in the VW community to post our comments of the service that we 
recieve from VW businesses and promoters to others?  Correct me if I am wrong 
but it seems that if it were NOT for the opinions expressed and experiences 
of others here on this list that many of us would indeed be screwed out of a 
lot of hard earned cash.  Take the Todd Hill story for instance.  If someone 
has a bad experience they should have the right to tell their friends. 

The fact that these individuals have been banned from the events is painting 
quite a picture in many enthusiasts heads.  What exactly does banishment 
accomplish?  It is just feeding a fire.  It is their event though and they 
MAY make whatever decision they feel necessary.

I myself rely upon the experience of others to help me.  I do not take what 
one person says and accept that as how it is though.  I just weigh the good 
and the bad and make my OWN choice.

just MY opinion

My bus will be on the road tomorrow!! WOOHOO!
