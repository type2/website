&gt; Where is the &quot;barn door&quot; on a crew cab type 2?

This &quot;barn door&quot; crew has had me wondering.  I thought the Binz were first
made in '58.  Was I wrong?  I thought I was paying specific attention to the
years, since my first choice would have been a YOB Double Cab from '57.
Having been told that they didn't exist, I'm more than happy with my '60 DC.

Can someone enlighten me?

Scott
