Subject: Re: [VB] Re My New 21 Window Bus!

first of, congratulations on your purchase....second.... got to:
www.vintagebus_dot_com and register your bus there. Once you do it, it will tell
you what you got and what those M-codes mean.

Good luck,

&gt; Hello Everyone
&gt;
&gt;     Before the list went down I was in the process of picking up my new 21
&gt; window bus. A lady at work told me that there was one in town but because
&gt; her boyfriend wanted it she wouldn't tell me where it was. Well a couple
&gt; months go by and they are no longer an item anymore so she told me where
it
&gt; was and so I contacted the owner and he agreed to sell it to me for a very
&gt; good price. I am very happy that I was able to get one of these busses
they
&gt; are getting very hard to find at a good price.
&gt;
&gt;     I have one question I am looking for the information on these number
or
&gt; a location where I can fine them. I can't remember where they were posted
on
