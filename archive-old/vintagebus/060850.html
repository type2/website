Subject: Britt's on the road

We just arrived in Havasu from Albuquerque, and Ronnie
wanted me to tell everyone that Britt called and he
and the Road Cow are on the road, and the trans seems
to be working well.  We'll know for sure when he pulls
in around 6am tomorrow.

JP

113 degrees and lots of busses in Havasu!
