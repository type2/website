Wow! this list is amazing!
I got a very welcome flood of techniques to remove that dust cap from the
wheel bearing housing, and with the increased confidence that it was only
friction holding it on, I was able to pop it off (although I feel stupid for
not realizing that it was the speedometer cable with the cotter pin at the
end).

I'm well on my way to cleaning &amp; repacking my &quot;new&quot; front end. Thanks!

BUT...

The cap came off, the lock nut came off, the nut came off, The outer bearing
set pulled out, I backed off the brake shoes to the limit of the adjuster
thingy through the hole in the brake housing, And the Brake housing still
won't come off!  It is very loose, but I can only pull it out about an
eighth to a quarter of an inch &amp; then it hits something which won't budge.
I can see nothing preventing it from just dropping off of the spindle when I
turn it upside down; but something does.  The inner bearing set stays
securely on the spindle, the wheel falls away about an eighth of an inch and
then it gets caught on something.

If anyone suspects what it might be that I've missed, please let me know;
for now, I've been beat.
Oh yeah, It is a `63 bus &amp; a `62 front end.
