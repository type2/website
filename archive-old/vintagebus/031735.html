WHAT&quot; you're coming to the CLASSIC again, without a gas payment bribe! Let's
see if you are going to camp with us or not. Ever been in a 50 plus bus
Busavan? Be at Rich's  (Christmas tree island) Friday night and be part of
the Largest busavan in Cali. to the OCTO meet.

Some of you may remember the strange, loud rattling noise my engine was
making _at_ KP.

Scott and I stopped by the local VWFLAPS this weekend to pick up some misc
spares 
for his trip home, and I had the guy listen to my engine.  He thinks my cam
gear
rivets are toast.  By turning the gen pulley with a wrench, there's about
1/2&quot; of
&quot;play&quot; in the crank pulley, meaning you can turn it that far without
significant
resistance.  Anyone ever had this problem before?

So, this means I have to get the engine out, torn down and fixed, and back
in and
tested in about 3 weeks.  But I can't get started until the parts for the
911 get
here and I get them installed.  It's gonna be a squeeze to get all this done
by
The Classic!
