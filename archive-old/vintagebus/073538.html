&lt;&lt; OKAY:
 ran compression on #3 and #4 for comparison:
 
 #3 is 130 with NO leak-down.
 
 #4 is 127 with no leak-down.
 
 They both look normal, which is wierd considering all symptoms.
 
 My timing at full advance is 27 degrees, using a good quality KAL Advance
 timing light, with low hours of use. I think it should be at 30, I'll set
 it at 30 - any opinions are welcome here.
 
 As I've stated before , my main concern is that loss of 4 mils (seat
 recession on #3 exhaust), on #3 exhaust.

I guess I should have read my mail before responding before.  But I hate 
electronic ignition, and would dump it.   did temp ever get above 220?    Give the 
bus an oil change even if it's early, drive it easy, sounds like nothing's 
too major.  Do a tea leaf reading on the oil, watch oil drain for inconsistant 
consistancy.  do the push pull test for end play.   backing the timing off a 
couple degrees often reduces backfiring.


I recently replaced the oil temp guage in my 65 that read from 150 F to 300F 
for one that went from 40C to 120C.  ( ~115F to 250F)   I can watch the bus 
warm up now.   easier to read temps.   300?  hey, if it's above 250F it's 
already too dern hot, so why bother with the next 50 degreesF?
