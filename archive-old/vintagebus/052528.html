Subject: RE: [VB] Sheet metal cutting

 I have just been trying out a new Plasma cutter before I make the plunge
and all I can say is wow. My old one worked good but didn't really like
greasy parts or thick paint. The one I am trying out so far will cut through
anything I have tried. The first thing I cut was some centers out of some
crusty backing plates, NO problem. So if it quit's raining. Yes it is
raining in Havasu today, I am going to cut up the 59 panel that has been
hanging out here for a while. All of the sheet metal is spoken for. I will
report back on how long and how good a job this does. I have a can opener
for my air chisel that I use a lot for sheet metal but it does take a 1/4
inch of metal away with it. The panel beaters here in town have a set of air
shears they use to cut and trim sheet metal, just like the ones that give
you cramps in your hands. They don't like the nibblers to much as they feel
it takes to muh metal away.

ps. these are the guys that HAND BUILD complete bodys. On a lighter note.
Another guy here in town took them his DC to have the drivers dog leg and
the door bottom repaired and instead of buying pre made parts or replacing
the door, they BUILT a new dog leg (inner and outer piece)and built a
complete new bottom for the door. When they were done you could not tell
they were replaced. Ahh if I was only so talented

&gt; Anyone tried a plasma cutter??

Yeah, they're great, but the $1200+ price tag is a bit
much for the casual user.  I bought myself one for a
birthday present this year, and am really pleased, but
that's a lot of money to spend just to cut metal a
little faster.

No room for more busses, and no wife to spend my money
on, so tools are the thing!
