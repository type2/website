Subject: Re: [VB] 1964 Type II Bumpers

Dave -

Wolfsburg West is generally the source for early bumpers and related parts,
however, it appears they may be out at the moment.

That's a switch - the &quot;decent&quot; ones are on the East coast?  Hmmmm, it's
usually the Left Coast that has the good stuff with little or no rust.

Oh, it would be nice to know where you're at so that someone possibly close
to you can help out.

Also, give a call to Derek at Wayout Salvage in Arkansas and see what he's
got (479-665-4126).  He's pretty good about having this hard-to-find stuff
for the splitties (and other models as well).

&gt; Is there any source in North America for new reproduction bumpers.  I have
&gt; seen a few used and banged up ones on &quot;thesamba&quot; but most people won't
&gt; ship
&gt; and everything that looks decent is on the East coast and would cost me a
&gt; fortune to take time off work to go get them.
&gt; Thanks
