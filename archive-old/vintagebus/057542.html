Subject: RE: [VB] Synthetic Oil Test 

I dont think so exactly...
The head temp is only a part of the equation. You would want to get
some asst case readings as well. Maybe more.

&gt;  If synthetic oil 'did not' have the heat carrying properties of dino oil,
&gt; wouldn't the results be just like Hart's?  The oil temps would show a
&gt; 'lower' number because the cylinder head heat is not being removed
&gt; by the oil, dipstick would feel cooler also.  What we need is to have a
&gt; cylinder head temp gauge and do a test first with dino in there and
&gt; then with synthetic and see if in fact what the &quot;head&quot; temps are doing.
