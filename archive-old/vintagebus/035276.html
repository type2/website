&gt; loor inside are a straight rear bumper, complete with overriders and splash pans, and a what-not cabinet!  I called him and asked if he was interested in selling them, he said &quot;take 'em&quot; :-)  I took a picture of the shelf, this is what will be used to make measurements and compare for the repros, if we do them.  Is it actually the right shelf?  Has a hinged compartment on top.

yup- thats the whatnot cabinet for a splitty so 42 westy- i'm jealous
 

&gt; Next, the enigma of the steering lock. If it's in the Bentley, ignore this...the Bentley is with the Kombi in Cleveland.  Along with most of my tools.  Pics of the switch...

yes the first two pictures look like it is a 67 steering/ig lock.  the difference between that and the 3/55 through 66 kind is the key wat- and yes you can get a key and tumblem for an early bay or for a 68 on bug and use that in the lock.  or you can get a locksmith to cut a key to the lock.  Which could be an advantage as they you could get one key for all locks.  If fact, you could check the key codes on the front doors/ back hatch ( odds are you no longer have a 67 cargo door handle- they break often) - the code will be something like 20L123, and you can get a key cut to code at a locksmith and it shoudl work the ignition- pretty cool huh?   Yes there are pictures in the Bentley book

The third picture looks like something someone wired in- why?  maybe you electrical portion no longer works, or someone lost a key or?
