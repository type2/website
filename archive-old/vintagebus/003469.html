&gt;
&gt; Yes. Might be a good idea to put the later model disc brakes (72 and on)
on
&gt; there when you find some in a bone yard. One year parts are more expensive
&gt; than the multi-year and the later ones are bigger meaning a little more
&gt; braking power.
&gt;

No, the pads are the same size. Later ones are thicker. Same braking power.
The difference is in the lifespan of the pads.
