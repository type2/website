&gt;Wow! I've got one of these that has the original, working speaker and an
&gt;antenna out of a bus. Is it really worth $100...
&gt;
&gt;Its all relative to how much you want for it and how much people are
willing
&gt;to pay.  I personally wouldn't pay $100 for a Saphire radio unless it
looked
&gt;NOS and still had knobs.  If it were a period Blaupunkt, that price be very
&gt;reasonable for a mid-condition radio.
&gt;One opinion in a sea of millions...

Wery intelesting. The 67 Westfailure has her o-riginal Sapphire VIII AM
8-track snuggled into her uncut dashhole. And me with no Credence Clearwater
tapes.

Never attempt to teach a pig to sing, it wastes your time and annoys the
pig.
