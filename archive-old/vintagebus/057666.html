Subject: RE: [VB] domed pistons?

&gt; I've been helping my friend who bought a big VW stash. We came across
some domed pistons. Were these for race engines or something? These thing=
s
were REALLY domed!
&gt;
Probably Type 3, 64-65 1500S.

They are not REALLY domed, just domed.

It's rare that anyone would be still be driving around a 64-65 with the
domed pistons because everyone blew them up from not using Super gas but
those cars are REALLY fast (in a 60s VW sense)
