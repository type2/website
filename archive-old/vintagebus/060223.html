Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus



 I have completely the wrong switch and knob then - it was very cheap
anyway!

 Is the knob for a 66 the same size and shape as the rest of the knobs or
 just the same shape?

 Thanks for all the replies so far!
 Paul

&gt;
&gt; &gt; on the pre 66 system, there is a Big Red Light (BRL) on the dash near
the
&gt; &gt; speedo, which flashes.  The knob itself is red bakelite or plastic and
&gt; does
&gt; &gt; not flash.  It has an innie, like the other dash knobs. The switch is
held
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; with a screw from underneath
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 66  switch is held in my an escutchon that screws in from the hole
the
&gt; &gt; knob goes onto. You use a wierd tool that is like a screwdriver with a
gap
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; the middle and the slightly tapered at the outside.  using a screwdriver
&gt; &gt; nagers up the escutchon.  The knob is translucent red plastic, and has
an
&gt; &gt; outie.  The whole switch lights up when the flashers flash.  The face
&gt; &gt; unscrews so you can change the bulb
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the 67 switch is held on the same way as the 66.  (fwiw the 68 and later
&gt; &gt; escutchons use a different size of the same type of tool)  The knob is
&gt; shaped
&gt; &gt; of black rubber like the other 67 knobs - which are not shaped like the
&gt; 66&amp;
&gt; &gt; earlier knobs.  The face is a red plastic circle that unscrews so you
can
&gt; &gt; change the bulb.when the light flashes only the face lights up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hadn't paid attention to whether 66 &amp; 67 switches were the
same/different,
&gt; &gt; but I know you can use a 67 knob on a 66
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; if your light doesn't flash maybe see if the light bulb burned out.
