I'm not sure which style air cleaner - clipped or spin-on - you should have,
but it's going to the the one that comes up and to the left, unless you
have a gas heater, in which case you need the bits to move it to the right.

&gt; I am starting to collect pieces to build a proper 36hp for my early 1959

&gt; air cleaner have a wing nut in the center or should it have clips? Also,
&gt; does a bus carb have a nipple for a vacuum advance that is just capped or is
&gt; the casting different?
