Subject: Bice bumpers...

Hi all,

My '59 Double Cab came with a nice pair of those Bice heavy duty steel
bumpers, front and rear.  I had 'em powder coated along with my wheels and
they look great.  God help anyone I have a fender bender with, these bumpers
are much stronger than the originals.  Once my D.C. is finished with the body
and paint work, I'll be deciding whether to put a stock original pair of
bumpers back on it and shelve the Bice bumpers for a while, or just continue
using the Bice bumpers.  I have to admit that when all cleaned up, they look
pretty cool.  My Bice I.D. plate is still there too, although I'm not sure
what serial number they are...
