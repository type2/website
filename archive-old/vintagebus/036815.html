&lt;&lt; What gauges should definitely be added?&gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
Oil pressure is the best to have.  Next best is oil temp.

&lt;&gt;
You should check it with a pot of boiling water to calibraite it.

&lt;&gt;
Well if you have the money and time then a head temp, voltage, and amps are 
good to have.  Tachometers are only really informative for the first 15 
minutes you run them unless you drag race or are deaf and need the gauge to 
tell you what the engine is doing.

&lt;&lt; And how hard are these to hook up for your average up and coming bus 
doctor?&gt;&gt;
All of them are easy.  If you can change your own oil, you can install 
gauges.  Make sure to pick up 21' of trailer wire needed to do one bus from 
engine compartment to dash.  The type that has a thick outer rubber coating 
and then 4-6 individual wires with differant color insulation inside.  

&lt;&lt;Also, my gas gauge doesnt work. Is there a procedure to run, and see if it 
is either my sender or the gauge itself? &gt;&gt;
Remove the wire on the front of the guage that goes to the sender.  Hook a 
short piece of wire up to the gauge there and ground out the other end of 
this wire to the body somewhere where there is no paint.  With the key on the 
gauge should read full and when the wire is removed from the grounding point 
on the body it should read empty.  If this is what happens then either your 
sender or the wireing to the sender is bad.      Eric&amp;Barb
