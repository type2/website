Subject: Re: Fuel sending unit replacement

Hey all,
I have been reading all the posts on this subject, and everyone says to
pull this or that.  Well it is possible to pull out the sending unit
without having to pull anything off the engine.  I have had to do this
many times.  If you take out the four engine bolts then let it hang, you
can then undo the tank straps and twist the tank enough to where the
sending unit will clear.  You must not have much gas in the tank when
doing this as it will make it easier to twist the tank.
