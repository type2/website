Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Part numbers

&gt;&gt; There is NO such thing as a factory installed 78 1800cc bus engine. A
&gt;&gt; 1978 USA bus came with a GE engine which is a 2.0L engine.

&gt; I've read Tom Wilsons book and I know the 78 is supposed to have
&gt; hydraulic lifters ............. but it doesn't.
&gt; The owner was misinformed, it hasn't got the OEM engine.

So how do you EXPECT to get the correct parts when you ask for parts for a non-existing engine AND you do not
specify what engine YOU really have??

Be realistic here! Parts people are going to give you the part that is called for on a 78 bus.
