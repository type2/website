&lt;&lt; Anyway, the front bearing (pulley side) froze a little.  The dowel pin 
hole in the case is a slot now.  About a diameter and a half long. &gt;&gt;
Hi Matthew,
Sounds like you are describing #4 bearing in the rear of the engine.  You can 
just have the pin hole redrilled in a differant place instead of welding.  
This was a VOA SOP.  You shoul take a look at the slip in 1641cc P&amp;Cs.  We 
have been very happy with ours for the last 40,000+ miles.   Eric&amp;Barb
