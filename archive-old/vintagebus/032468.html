Subject: Re:  [VB] Need barndoor Nose clip, floors, front doors

Hi Shawn, no nose, but I do have a barndoor butt that came off a dead in the 
woods with tree growing through it someone had taken off the nose and 
suspension years before early 54.  Standard.  From behind cargo doors back.  
Currently used as a shelf  (the above engine bit) in a shed, but since I 
picked up Mark's 59 westy it is kind of in the way.   Has corners, rusted at 
bottom &amp; around.  BD vents.    Have some other metal off that bus, barndoor 
side reinforcements are different.  It aint no NOS or perfect, but there are 
some usable pieces. Straight at least.   Then again,  it would make a pretty 
cool sandblast cabinet.

Hello,

I am hunting for a nose clip or portion for my Feb 55 Deluxe.  I also need 
front floor sections and front driver and passenger doors.  If there are any 
pieces - or salvage buses out there could you please drop me a line.

Thank you,
