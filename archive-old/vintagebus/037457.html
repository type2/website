Hi Steve,
It kind of depends on what you are looking for in the way of condition.  NOS,
then you are going to have to either contact VW specilty shops, or find a
stash of parts in Venezuela, Brazil, Greece, or some other far away quite
area where parts are not thrown away just because they are more than ten year
old.  Good used, you need to used to look around wrecking yards, swap meets,
or find a wrecked truck or bus for the engine compartment lid at someone
place.  Eric&amp;Barb
