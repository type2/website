     Lea wants black interior door handles for her '63 single cab since 
     we've finally installed the new gray door panels.  I found the black 
     collars but no luck on the handles.  All the aftermarket pinned 
     handles are beige.  Did they ever make black with pins?  I think I've 
     called everywhere about these.  
     The other option (she IS insistent) is to paint the beige ones.  Any 
     suggestions as to what might work and actually last?  
     Ray
