&lt;&lt; If an engine is throwing oil from the crank pulley but you do not have a

Hi Steve,
Again, check for threads on the pulley to be clean and even there.  Could be 
you have a pulley intended for a engine case bored for a sandseal.

&lt;&lt; I have installed an breather box that only vents the oil filler tube.  
Should I vent the valve covers also&gt; &gt;&gt;
If all else fails then yes.  If that still does not do the job, time for a 
rebuild soon.
