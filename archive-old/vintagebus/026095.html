&gt; Hello all,
&gt; What is the story on those reflectors that go above the rear tail lights?
&gt; Some early busses have them some do not.  I would like maximum visibility at
&gt; night and stay vintage at the same time.  Any sources?  I always thought
&gt; that they were just a owner installed job but after looking at the set that
&gt; Everett has for sale I'm not too sure.  His look factory.  Thanks.

Above the rear tail lights? On 67 busesthose are back up lights.

In 1950-1951 they put one red reflector on the lower left hand side.
In 1952 they put two on, one on each side,, but they were below the
lights.
In the 55 post-barny bus they made the reflectors part of the tail
lights. These are the flat ones with the chrome trim (not the really
early '50/'51 flat ones)...
