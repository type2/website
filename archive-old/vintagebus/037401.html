&lt;&lt; What kind of front end is this and what is the usual resto process for 
this? I have done nothing but type 1's and hummers the last 4 years, and this 
looks like a combination of ball joint, link pin, and jeep front end. What 
exactly am I looking at under there under all that dirt grime etc...I want to 
do this right, but I'm not rich either.  If I can fix/rebuild it, that is 
what i will do. I don't want to replace everything with new  parts!  &gt;&gt;
Hi Walt,
Best then to go out and buy yourself a Bentley reprint of the original VW bus 
shop manual for 1963-67 bus.  Lots of pictures for you to compare to what you 
have and proceedures for repair or replacement.  Cost about $60.00 to 90.00 
but is worth in info about 50 times more than any Haynes manual.  Eric&amp;Barb
