The aluminium tag on the air vent is not the M code tag.   Though it does say 
you have a deluxe (type 24).   The m code tag was installed behind the 
passenger seat, and if your metal partition was butchered, it may not be 
there, and I have seen it missing on some buses driving around.

so maybe the decoder wont decode things that aren't the m codes.

&lt;&lt; I'm tryin to reregister my bus on Thom's site and am having problems 
knowing 
 what's what.  I tryed the m-code help on the site but my browser wouldn't 
 bring it up.  My VIN badge is pop riveted to the passenger side of my roof 
 vent.  My divider panel has been butchered.  Pretty sure its the right badge 
 cause is a 66 and I have 66 handles and hatch.  Anyway heres what it looks 
 like.  Grateful for any guidence...And Thom your site just keeps kickin 
 harder!
