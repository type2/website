I don't have *squat* at this point but a dream.

We're going back out in a couple weeks for another scavenging/negotiating
session.

Should I post the outcome to the list? 8-P

&gt; Enough of the rescue s/c, any other thread would have been killed a long

&gt;and his 55. Get it or give it up! We get the idea, quite rubbing it in how
&gt;you got a super deal and it is worth 5 times what you paid for it. I'm
&gt;jealous of both you and Ronnie, wish I had the connections. Ready for
&gt;flames, John Howard
