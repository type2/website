Do you have a bench seat or a walk-thru? I had a 68 walk-thru once. I was
given a coleman cooler (super oscar) for x-mas one year. You can turn the
lid upside down and it has a place for 4 cans and a flat spot for whatever.
Anyway, it fit perfectly between the two seats and was almost the exact
height as the seats too. The other bonus was that I was able to use the
cooler as a console. :)
