Subject: Turn signals!!! was birds nest.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I took apart the turn signal switch so I could see what was in there. After 
staring at it a bit and not quite understanding what made them come on 
(hidden underneath?) I tried the switch and they WORKED. All of them. Still 
no brake lights. any clues?

PS. if anyone in the area wants me to heal their turn signals by looking at 
them I would be happy to help.
