Great info!  Koch's didn't have any shift bushings for that year for that
reason, so I ordered what you described out of the Rocky Mountain catalog
earlier today.  It is not a barndoor so I will instal the bushings and
inspect the shifter.

Thanks
Paul

&lt;&lt; I had problems getting it into reverse at first and the seller told me
that it needed a shift bushing &quot;same as in my beetle but easier to get at&quot;.
Now I lost 4th gear.
 :-(  So I am going to change the bushing and hope it is not the trans. &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
The 1959 and earlier front shift linkage do not use a plastic bushing.
Instead that area is all metal to do the same function.  The rear shift tube
in non-barndoor has two plastic bushings.  What probably is wrong is either
the rear flex shift coupler is spliting and/or the coupler bolts just
forward
of the tranny and/or where the front and rear shift rods meet in the forward
coupler are loosening.  You need to slide under there NOW, take a look to
figure out if you need to replace the rear flex shift coupler or at the
least
tighten either or both of the coupler bolts, and safety wire each so the
wire
tightens each bolt.  Otherwise expect to have no shifting all of the sudden
in traffic.  BTDT
Get the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67 soonest!
