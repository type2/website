The only nice thing about a GEX-bought engine is that when you approach the
list with a problem, it's easy as hell for the rest of us to diagnose:

1)  You should have never bought a GEX engine because they rebuild with worn
out parts or those that border on &quot;worn.&quot;
2)  Rebuild your own engine like you should have in the first place or spend
twice the money for a good rebuild at the other places.
3)  Spray paint does not generate more horsepower.

NQ :-)
