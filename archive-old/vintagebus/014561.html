sorry about that previous post.

what I meant to say was - 

on my way back from seattle the other night in my truck I was cruising along
in the slow lane down I 5, and found that listening to the motor and all I
felt more comfortable just above 50mph.   So I was putting slowly along about
52 ish.  How was the traffic?  Did people threaten me and do crazy manuvers?
well, actually not.  I played the &quot;count the people use use their turn signals
when merging in front of me&quot; game, and it was a surprising rate of about 75%.
Three people tooted their horns at me in a friendly manner.   One person did
try to pass on the right  (my turn signal was on) when a  lane opened up on
the right.

Neverthe less, I feel this is not really a freeway vehicle.   But is is so
useful.  Recently I took a fridge to the community recycle place to get rid of
it, did a dump run, took boxes of paint etc that the people who used  to live
here left to the appropriate disposal site, and have even loaded up a bunch of
misc scrap metal to do the same with.  It is much easier to load and unload
stuff with those stylee side gates, that having to lean over in a bus to put
stuff in and take it out.   I could not have fit the fridge in a bus, and the
guys who unloaded it  seemed pleased at being able to let the side down to
unload it, rather than the extra work of pushing it off the back.   Maybe I'll
haul some firewood with it.    The heat is good, the windsheilds do not leak.
Needs some work, but I am slowly fixing this and that.  (adjusting the
headlights was a good thing, for one)

It has a 40hp motor, and acceleration is noticably less when laden.  Patience
is required.
