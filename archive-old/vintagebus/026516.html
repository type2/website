Kevin:
The easy way to tell if the fuel solenoid is working or not is to get a
volunteer to turn the ignition switch on and off while you hang out by
the engine and listen for a 'click' every time the key is turned.  Don't
have them start the bus, just cycle the key on and off a few times.  If
you don't hear a click check to see if it gets power using your trusty
static timing light.  If no power the problem is in the wiring
somewhere.  If power but no click it's probably the solenoid.  It's easy
to remove and replace (standard thread etc.).  Take it out and ground it
against the carb body and repeat the switch test.  If the plunger works
then your dieseling is caused by something different, maybe dirt where
the solenoid seats..
