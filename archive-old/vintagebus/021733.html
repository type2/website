Subject: What brand ? brown + tan side awning ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

my friend just found a 66 camper, there is no name on any of the camper 
parts, 
it was made out of a walkthru  combi (L87 Pearl white)

the awning attaches to the roof with 2 pivots
the canvas is brown + tan stripes with a fringe around the edge

Any idea who made the camper or awning

ps....it also has a cool drink holder, that was slided into an aluminium 
extrusion mounted to the dash...........
