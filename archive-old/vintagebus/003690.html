No, I haven't heard of them warping, but it is common to get a hairline
crack from the oilhole (the one closest to the bumper) to the front of the
raised area on the case where the cooler goes.  You need to run it and get a
good light in there to see if that's where its leaking from.  The easiest
way will probably be to take the doghouse shroud and run it for a minute to
see if its leaking from there (don't run it too long, you have no fan!!!
DOH).  I went through 4 sets of seals, and too much RTV silicone to admit to
before I realized where the leak was coming from. Oh, and by the way, JB
weld, and regular welding won't fix the problem, you will have to get
another case (I tried 'em both, and Duct Tape Too!!).

Hope this helps,

&gt; I replaced the seals in my doghouse style cooler a few weeks ago. I
&gt; immediately noticed the bus started running hot. I took it apart again to
&gt; see what the problem was, and discovered I had replaced the 2 seals that
go
&gt; from the engine case to the cooler block with the wrong seals(too thick).
I
&gt; have now replaced the seals with the correct ones and the motor leaks ALOT
&gt; of oil. Has anyone ever heard of the block between the motor and cooler
&gt; warping? The bus did get hot 5 or 6 times! Thanks,
&gt;
