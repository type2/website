Howdy All:

A few months ago I purchased enough yardage of red &amp; black plaid wool material, from Doug Denlinger of Transporter Restorations in Arizona, to do the entire interior of my '59 Westy.  This means both rear seat cushion bases, both seat back rests, both wedge pillows and the childs cot/hammock.  There is currently no more of this fabric left, until now.

My '59 is a Mango bus, which means the material color should be yellow &amp; black, but I couldn't find any so I settled for red &amp; black.  Well, over the weekend I found some yellow and black fabric, woo hoo!!!!!  Now my bus can be correct and I can sleep again at night.  :)~

So, I won't be needing this fabric.  It's still rolled up in plastic as it was the day it arrived from Doug.  This fabric is beautiful.  In fact, the quality of Doug's fabric is superior to what I found, but the colors are most important to me now.  It's a very nice heavy woven wool, correct red &amp; black colors.  The squares are slightly larger than original, but I've done a lot of searching and fabric even close to original is extremely difficult to find.

So if anyone needs red &amp; black fabric for their early Westy, get ahold of me quickly.  Pmail me for details, pics, price, etc.  I'm not looking to make any money off of this fabric, just would like to sell it for what I paid.

Have a Happy New year bus folk!!!!!  Drive 'em at midnight!

Robert
