There's pics of the 'long' outers that
go all the way back on my site (before
installation too).  go to

www.splitbusaustralia_dot_com

click on the 59 US 23 window link in the left frame
and then the 'making belly pans' link

The longer outer pans for pre 60 (59 and down) three outrigger buses are
correct.  (I'm struggling with the new knowledge regarding the 'shorter'
pan and two outriggers
pan for 60 and up doubledoor and sunroof buses - never seen it that way
here).

Original pans are quite heavy at 1.2 mm.  Thom you'd get away with
adding a piece of cold rolled to extend a 'shorter' pan to the 'longer'
length.....

&gt; Hmm.  And I'd just fired off an email to Lenny about price and
&gt; availability of his belly pans.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't tell from the pix I had of the BD that lenny did if they
&gt; went all the way back or not.  From Cory's pix, it looks like
&gt; there is not a stamping in the section between the jackpoint
&gt; outrigger and the last outrigger, so I could fake it with a 
&gt; piece of 18ga flat sheet with a lip braked into it.  Once I 
&gt; welded it up and ground it down, only the most AR amongst us (ie FH)
&gt; would be able to tell.

&gt; &gt; Not to mention since lenny used the belly pans from woodys panelbus to
make 
&gt; &gt; patterns for his repops, that barndoor deluxe has the WRONG belly pans
(Not 
&gt; &gt; to mention 20 other things
