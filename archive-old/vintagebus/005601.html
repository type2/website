&gt; No VWs I know of, but they did build one from a Ford Pinto. &gt;Had to have a
fairly hefty engine to get the weight of the Pinto &gt;off the ground (the
Pinto engine was not used in flight). From &gt;what I  understand, the project
ended when the Pinto detached &gt;from the wing in flight: (from

Great stories! They sound like early candidates for the Darwin Awards.

For entertainment, here is Volkswagen's official policy on their engines in
aircraft in the 1950s:

SERVICE BULLETIN No. 21-KDT 10-    August 20th, 1955

Using VW engine as aircraft power unit

The fact that the possible power of the VW engine is not fully exploited
entices many an amateur constructor or &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; to make the VW
engine the subject of various experiments. The doubtful results of such jobs
are sufficiently known.

There is an increasing number of requests for specific information about the
various ways and means of using our engine as power unit for small
aircrafts.

The factory refuses to sell engines for that purpose and expects you to fall
in line with this policy.

The development of aircraft engines is in the hands of competent designers
employed by aircraft building factories. From the first line on the drawing
to the completion of intensive experiments, such engines are created to suit
a given airplane. The conditions to be met by these engines differ entirely
from those of automobiles or industrial engines.

The installation of a more or less successfully modified VW engine in an
airplane is a bungle susceptible to failure. This is bound to affect our
reputation, as in all cases of failure lives of human beings are at stake.
Even the fact that planes of German or foreign origin equipped with VW
engines and partly known under the name &quot;Volksflugzeug&quot; are already in
operation will not induce us to support applications for licenses. None of
these VW engines have been converted with our approval.
