Subject: Re: [VB] Door Hinge Problem

As Thom said, you'll have to open the pillar....... but do it from the
interior.

I had to do mine as I had stripped the bottom front side door hinge
screws. It's not really that bad and non-structural .....if you have the
measurements right. Took 1.5 hours to do mine using a Dremel with cutting
disc. I could probably do it faster now that I have done it once as it is
with most VW repairs.

You'll need a donor hinge plate and if you hacksaw/chisel out one around the
hinge area to get the plate you'll understand how some of the metal plates
overlap and where you need to cut on the back.

.......So here's what I did in measuring up the front side door. Draw two
parallell lines from the top and bottom of the hinge from the exterior
wrapping into the interior. Measure 21mm into the interior along both these
lines from the inside door edge. Draw a vertical line from this measurement
connecting the two hinge lines. Draw another vertical line 8mm from the
first line. Cut along both vertical lines from the top and bottom hinge
lines.One more small cut along bottom to make a small metal flap and then
peel up.

Magnet to retrieve old plate, then you should be ready to go with
your replacement plate and &quot;new&quot; screws. I replaced the parts in mine,
pulled the metal flap down and sealed with seam sealer and then touch-up
paint.  Or you can weld up, etc., etc., ........Also had to use tweezers
on the hinge plate with nylon tie to hold it and slide it into the small
metal
holding bracket.

Further info......My bus was a '67 and this will be different with the early
high hinge doors.

&gt; &gt; I pulled out the second bolt the plate slid down inside the door frame.
&gt; How do I get the plate out and how do I get it back in place and keep it
&gt; there?  The other lower hinge came out but I stuck a piece of welding rod
&gt; in one hole so plate would not slide down door frame.
&gt; Any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks in advance
