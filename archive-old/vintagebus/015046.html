&gt; Hi All,

&gt; I'm still considering the Okrasa setup in my double cab.... the thought by
&gt; Thom of the Porche is tempting but....
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, due to time constraints, I don't want to tackle the building of such
&gt; at this time and I want to do a few shows this summer in the PNW.  I have
&gt; found two builders and would appreciate any feedback from listees that might
&gt; have a comment.   Joe Ruiz is one and Richard Troy is the other.  (I either
&gt; one of you are subscribers.... I'm just checking...)  Anybody know these
&gt; people????

Thom
