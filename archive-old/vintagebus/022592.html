&gt;I am trying to find a custom powder coat color for my rims and bumpers.
&gt;As far as I can tell, the correct color for my Crew Cab rim faces and
&gt;bumpers is Bright White (or Silver White - PPG DCC8251). 

The Correct color should be either Traffic White (RAL 9016) or Signal White
(RAL 9003)

  The one place I have
&gt;located in my area that will actually duplicate the color has told me I
&gt;need an order of at least $2,000 to make it worth their while.  

These are not difficult or expensive colors to make.
 Check with some local Body shops about coating parts (they may have a more
consistant relationship with a powder coater and be able to get a better
price for you).
