Subject: Re: [VB] Will a z-bed from a '70 camper fit a split?

Fits w/o mods.  Use the rear seat bolts that hold it to the rear seat  
mounting areas.  Works in my 61 15 window.

I have a  '65 that I'm restoring, and recently picked up a z-bed for

I'll have to make  slight modifications to get this installed, but does
anyone have details on  how to do this, or is there a writeup online
somewhere that I can refer  to?

Thanks,Michael (vwdrum)
