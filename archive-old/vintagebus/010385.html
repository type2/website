[...]

It bears noting that the VW factory published, in Germany, a series of
owner-oriented repair manuals.  The last of these was, as best I've been
able to document, for 1968 through 1970 models of buses and bugs [separate
books].

Those I've seen are titled &quot;Volkswagen Service Manual&quot; [followed by the
names of the vehicles/models covered].

These are far more detailed and comprehensive than any &quot;aftermarket&quot; manuals
I've used or reviewed.  I have the VW-published manual covering '68 through
'70 type 2s, and for those years it's definitely superior to the
corresponding Bentley manual [which I also have].

I've also browsed/reviewed other editions of the VW-published manuals
covering earlier VWs, and they seem to be equally detailed and
comprehensive.

If I had to choose between a reprint of a Bentley manual or one of the
VW-published manuals covering a VW year/model I owned, I'd go for the
VW-published book without hesitation.

FWIW.....
