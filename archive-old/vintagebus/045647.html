&lt;&lt; My '58 came with a rear bumper, and without looking at it, I just bought a 
bunch of the hardware that the front bumper used, but I have no idea how the 
rear bumper goes on. Are there supposed to be brackets for them? My guess is 
that there had to have been, are they hard to find? Also, what did they have 
on them. Both bumpers are white, but have holes and markings that had to have 
been for overriders or rubber trim. Can anyone fill me in with this info?

yes you need brackets, and they are the rear stamped bumper only, so of course are hard to find.   
It is also nice to have the splash pans, which of couse are not easy to come by.  I think a reinforcement is in order as well, as you could dent those flimsy stamped bumpers by breathing on them.  A piece on angle iron or spring steel can be hidden in the curve of the bumper.


if the bumper is deluxe if you have holes for the trim to screw onto.  Those would be small holes to the outside of the bumper bracket holes.

 These did not come with overriders.  

 There would be two holes through the bumper for the brackets to bolt to at. (A preposition at the end of a sentence is something up with which I will not put.)

The stamped bumpers came two tone.   On dove blue buses dove blue, with the raised section white.
