&lt;&lt;  I am looking for a bus side step, repro or original, for my brother's 66
 Westy.  Any listees have a source?  I would like to find one to give my
 brother for christmas.. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
Which one of those bus side steps are you looking for?  The front door steps
that are just mounted there, or the ones that fold out, or the cargo step that
mounts in the jack points (Aluminuim, or the diamond plate steel ones?), or
the one that mounts under the bus and with a push of it's pedal the step pops
out from under the forward cargo door?
