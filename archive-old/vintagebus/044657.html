Subject: Too tight windows....
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


    Just put all brand new rubber on all windows.....when I got the the 
driver and passenger side Went through everything and made sure windows still 
slid in channel...but when I put them back in the bus and put everything 
together...windows are extremely tight in channels and hard to open and 
close...any suggestions on how to remedy this tightness?  TIA, Chris
