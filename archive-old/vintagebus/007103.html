You don't get any awards or prizes - just the recognition you deserve if you
can tell me what this part is or what it's for.  Here's a hint:  It's from a
71 Baywindow bus.  For those of you reading this on the Vintage T2 list, you
may want to email me your guesses offline at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com although,
this part could very well have been used on a split window bus.
