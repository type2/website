  While trying to get my early Bn4 gas heater working the other day, I found
that the regulator diaphragm was leaking gas....no big surprise since when it
would run it spewed black smoke.I went through the archives and found the post
from about year ago that described in detail how to make a new regulator
diaphram.I've kind of dreaded it and put it off for quit a while. Figuring it
was my only option since new parts were supposedly not available. I started
rereading the procedure and making a mental shopping list.Well on a last ditch
effort I decided to call JB's Heater Service. I was very surprised when I was
told &quot;sure I have those&quot;. In fact he said he could either recondition mine for
around 28.00 or sell me a brand new one for 60.00. I know the new ones are a
little steep but i guess it a case of supply and demand.
  I knew many people were in the same boat so I figured I 'd pass the info
along.

Hey there,
Just a reminder that our campout is this week end at Harrison bay state park.
Oct-16-17-18. I plan to get there sometimes Friday afternoon. The cost still
stands at $14.00 a night(for 2 people) .50 cents each additional person. Make
sure you have the right amount to pay the ranger when he comes by. This area
is loop c. 
One camper per site, plus you can have a tent. Please contact those fellow vw
friends that doesn't have a computer, we don't want to leave anyone out.
Here are some general directions

From Georgia
Take 75 to Chattanooga at the split take 75 towards Knoxville, about 3-4 miles
you will come to another split, take the right two lanes, go left onto hwy 153
(airport, chicamagua dam), follow that to the hwy 58 Decatur exit(note: after
you pass the bonny oaks exit get in the right lane, your exit is next and
comes up fast), Harrison bay is about 8.5 miles on the left. Make that left on
Harrison bay road. It is 1.5 miles to the park, make that left head for the
camp sites. The signs will guide you.((Dave and Louise, pass the word))

From Alabama
If on hwy 24 to Chattanooga go to the hwy 75 split , head to Knoxville then
use the above direction to get you to the bay.(see you there Bo &amp; Tonya)

From Knoxville
Take 75 to chattanooga, then get off at exit 11 Ooltewah, make a right off the
ramp, then head into the left lane. You will be making that left on Hunter
Road. Follow hunter road until it ends. Then make a right, this is hwy 58. It
is 1.6 miles to Harrison Bay Road turn left, then 1.5 miles to the state park.
Once in the park follow the signs to the camping area.

***There is a little store before you get into the state park. Thought you'd
like to know. 
Also, I was told the ranger doesn't like cousies(those things you put you
beverages in), or visible beer cans or bottles. So remember to bring a colored
cup.
If you have Halloween lights bring them or any type of lights, we can drape
our vws in them for the season. SHoot, dress your vw up if you'd like.

We look forward to seeing you all. If you don't like to camp, come by to
visit.

Frank&amp; Kathy
