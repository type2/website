THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!

This is great - it's like having an old friend back again!!!

I was lamenting the website's disappearance and now that it's back, I'm
gonna have to go surf it again!  There are some darn good stories on the
site.  I'm just trying to figure out the tie-in between Ohio, the Great
Lakes, and Costa Rica.
