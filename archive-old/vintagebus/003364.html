jdd-
Your distributor is listed at
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com
as a replacement for 1970 Beetle autostick

confirm the drive gear is installed correctly.
The zero timing mark may indicate correct
orientation in two places, you have to sort
out the valve opening indicator., i.e.
both valves on # 1 closed with the  zero mark.
Pull the valve covers and you will see what happens.
You could be at top dead center on # 3.
( Back to the book :^)

&gt;So my distributor number is both of the following
&gt;0231 170 034 and 043 905 205
&gt;can anyone tell me anything about it.  It seems kinda wierd actually,
&gt;because when use the idiot book and try and set it to the grove, or notch in
&gt;the edge it seems to point in the wrong way.  I want to order points etc..
&gt;and I have never been asked for my distributor number before - I always just
&gt;use the number on the old condenser.  This time the FLAPS asked for my
&gt;distributor number so I thought I would go that route - blah, blah, blah.
