I'm not a lawyer, but I work around them for a living and have almost
started thinking like them  (yeah,  its warped my mind, but I digress) as it
relates to intellectual property.  IMHO, I dont think anybody should own the
archives, and quite frankly nobody should even want to own them.  If
somebody out there wants their posts stripped, fine (I dont care about mine
FWIW).  Two points come to mind.

The first is ownership.  Who &quot;owns&quot; the content that we all provide?  I
would think that the closest claim would have to be the guys that keep us
running on a daily basis.  But since this archive is an agreagate collection
of litterally hundreds of individuals, what claim would there be to that
ownership unless everybody who contributed over the years knew up-front that
they waived the ownership of their post by joining in the first place; the
infamous &quot;fine print&quot;.

The second would be liability (the part that lawyers salivate over).
Assuming that &quot;ownership&quot; could be pinned down to an individual, are they
responsible; financially and otherwise; for bad advice given?  As an example
I have a problem concerning my engine loosing oil.  Billy-Bob (in a post
found in the archive) says not to worry about it and my engine blows up.
Would the &quot;owner&quot; of the archive be responsible for replacing my engine (and
the zillions of dollars in pain and suffering that a lawyer could try to
get)??

... this is too heady for a Sunday morning.  I think I'll go out to the
garage and change the oil (I didnt really believe Billy-Bob anyway) in the
bus.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I have a question for the group. My understanding of copyright law is
that
&gt;  &quot;any&quot; unauthorized reproduction of intellectual material is a copyright
&gt;  violation.
&gt;
&gt;  If this is indeed the case, wouldn't an online archive of messages be
just
&gt;  as much of an infringement of copyright as messages reproduced on CD-ROM?
&gt;
&gt;  Any copyright attorneys out there want to take a stab at this one?
&gt;

&gt; Yeah, I used to be one of those big shot copyright attorneys, til...til I
&gt; fell on hard times. Now I just drive around in my bus.
