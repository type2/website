Subject: Re: [VB] cargo door handles
To: srbushko_at_hotmail_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the door that has the outside handle on it the outside handle square shaft 
goes through the door mechanism, out the inside :) and the inside handle fits 
on it.  If the shaft is about flush with the mechansim you have a cargo door 
outside handle and it does not take and inside handle.  On the door you only 
have the inside handle on, the door mechanism has the sqaure shat to put the  
inside handle on I hope this helps.

 Hello list
 I'm close to having the 66 westy back on the road, just a few little things 
 left to fix.
 
 One thing, not a real big deal, is the interior cargo door handles.  When 
 your are sitting inside at the table and want to get out.  The door on the 
 left is missing the handle,  so I pick one up on an old parts deal.  Anyway 
 the problem is there needs to be a square peg (I think) coming out of the 
 left handle assembly so that the handle can mount then get screwed to the 
 assembly.  At lease that is the way for the right door but the right door 
 handle assembly square peg thing seems to be made not to come out. So what 
 I'm getting at, is there a part (square peg) that is missing in time or if I 
 order an replacement handle, it would come with that made into the handle?
