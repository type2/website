Subject: Front seat help  (65 bus)

Can anyone help?

I began to rebuild the front seat for my bus this afternoon.  Turns out
it has a broken spring.  Can anyone help me locate one?  This is for a
65 Samba was a 1/3-2/3 front seat.  i need the upper spring in the
drivers seat backrest.  this is a wavy spring that is bent on both ends
to stand it off from the frame.

Can anyone help out?

Thanks
MAtthew
