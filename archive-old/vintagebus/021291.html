&gt; what kind of Generator do you have.  there is a longer one that was used on 
&gt; 71 buses, more amps,  and requires a certain kind of generator pulley, or 
&gt; it'll be offset.   what are the numbers on your generator?   

I think that the difference was in the plate that attaches to the shroud.
The longer generator required the plate that had a bit of dish in it.
--------
think it needsboth the dish and the special pulley
