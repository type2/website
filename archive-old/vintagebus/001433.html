hey guys, just found one of the coolest pages I've seen on the net yet. Its
&quot;virtual reality 3d modeling&quot; of vintage buses, ghias, bugs, things,
notchbacks, hebmullers etc. when clicking on a pic make sure you click on
the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; sign at the bottom of the pic to see more of that model.
Awesome colors and some neat resto custom pics make this definitely worth
checking out. Although he must have &quot;forgotten&quot; to include any vintage
single cabs, but he makes up for it with a cool rendering of a double cab
loaded to the hilt with swap parts :) go check it out  -wade
