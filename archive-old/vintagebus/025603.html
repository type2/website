Hi Fellow Listees,
Just a short note to let you know that we have picked up the 65 SC that
we were looking at, saving it from a fate worse than death. We bought
the 65 for $150.00 and although it has the usual rust areas, we have all
the fun ahead of us starting with a full recovery of the running gear
and tidy up her appearance. We will keep you all posted with all the
updates. If you want to see the 65 Single cab with the funky &quot;Dust less
option&quot; the URL is
