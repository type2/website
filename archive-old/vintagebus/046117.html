Hi NQ,
We do not use loctite on our head and engine case fasteners.  No matter how 
much you could loctite heads cylinders, case halfs shift and the steel 
fasteners stretch.  Resulting in a loose engine about 30-40,000 miles which 
is easily remedied by stripping down the engine to long block form and 
retorquing everything.  Dried Loctite would just gum up the torque readings.  
Matter of fact VW suggests in the 1959 bus shop manual to use a grease mixed 
with graphite on all the head nuts/studs to keep the head nuts torqurable.
