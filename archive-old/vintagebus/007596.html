Subject: Length of overlap if using 15 window rear quarters &amp; hatch, over Bay DC cab rear
Date: Sun, 1 Jul 2001 10:28:42 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Would anyone know (hypothetically, or course) how much further the cab would
extend to the rear, if the rear end of a trashed 15 Window were to be
grafted onto the rear of the cab of a rusted out Bay Double Cab?
(http://neale_dot_org/images/yeti.gif)  2-3-4&quot; perhaps?
