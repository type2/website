Subject: chroming in Germany??

--part1_180.675ffe5.29e49e9d_boundary

Now I know a lot of you know people over here in Germany.  I am looking for a 
reputable shop to do some chroming for me.  Specifically the bumpers on my 
bus as I have been unable to secure a set in a reasonable amount of time or a 
definite answer.  Any of you guys and gals know anybody???
