Subject: Last Minute BOTC instructions

Hi Volks,

As the clock ticks through the final week before Buses of the Corn 
things are moving ahead smoothly. Registration emails continue to come 
in regularly with 48 buses now pre-registered.

Since BOTC is slightly earlier than usual this year I was concerned 
about the corn harvest at first, but driving around rural areas lately 
have put that fear to rest. We are due for a bumper crop this year!

HELP WANTED: If you can bring drinking water containers, please do so. 
We have no certified water on site, though there is a place to get some 
within a couple minutes drive. We originally planned to have a 150 
gallon tank on-site but it fell through. Having extra 5-gallon jugs for 
the kitchen area would be appreciated; it's worked fine in past years.

WEATHER WATCH: We've had some uncertain weather lately, but BOTC WILL 
HAPPEN RAIN OR SHINE!!!  There are plenty of activities to keep us 
occupied and lots of shelter available to keep dry if it rains. Right 
now the weatherman is calling for cooler weather, with temps in the mid 
60's during the day and high 50's at night. Pack a board game, dominoes 
or a deck of cards in your bus just in case.  For up-to-date weather 
forecasts see:

Happy trails... See you at Buses Of The Corn!!!
