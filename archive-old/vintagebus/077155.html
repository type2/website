Subject: Music in your Bus- VW Content &gt; even on a Friday

Oh man, with faked innocence, I claim that I did not mean to upset the list
with that even handed, unbiased political Christmas jingle. Bah-hahahaha
Whatever...

I did make mention of a group named Hayseed Dixie and the CD &quot;A Hillbilly
Tribute to AC/DC&quot;. It is a real group with professional session bluegrass
musicians on a real CD. Has to be one of most WHACKED things that I have ever
heard. It is SO ridiculous that it's almost good. Almost.
If you are rednecked, out of control, open minded, inbred or from a deep holler
in Alabama, Tennesee or Kentucky then you'd dig it for 'shore'... Otherwise
crawl back to Michael McDonald bleeting out his butchering of the Motown
classics that sound more like a freshly neutered bassett hound with an
infection on a short rope sitting out in the cold.
Happy Kwanzaa, and word to yo mommas.
-Ellis
