Hi Volks,
Could you not just work out the brass tubes out of the reserve switch and 
install them opposite?  Or just cut off the longer one to the same hieght and 
the short and solder the piece you cut off of the one to the top of the 
reserve tube?  
  After cutting apart several gas tanks with a bronze chisel to prevent 
sparks/explosion we are now cutting off the reserve tube.  Too much evidence 
of this tube causing a puddle of water to rest below it's stock hieght 
causing corrosion in the area about a two inch radius inside the tank nearest 
the switch.  Figure we can just drain the carb float bowl a little more often 
to rid the system of water/gunk!  Plus this should give us a bit more reserve 
range.   
Soon to be installing reserve switches in our 1962 flip-seat westie and 1963 
SC.   Eric&amp;Barb
