Subject: Re: [VB] side pop outs needed

Hi John,

I am from Dayton, OH - lived in Riverside for several years!

As for your question, you can buy new, virgin popout frames from Wolfgang 
International.  I have bought a few from them myself, and they are every bit 
as good as the originals.  Go to http://www.wolfgangint_dot_com, and search 
their catalogue with the phrase &lt;Side Popout Window Frame&gt;.

Good luck,

Richard
