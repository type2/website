Cheapest deal on the Bentley manual is through (believe it or not) J.C.
Whitney, for about $60.  Everywhere else usually charges around $90.

&gt; Hello everyone, My new to me crew cab has some serious electrical problems.
&gt; The factory harness does not appear to have been hacked really, there is
&gt; just alot of stuff unplugged. It has a standard relay, but I see no &quot;black
&gt; box&quot;. Should I have one? It is a 63 model that has been converted to 12v.
&gt; I'm ready to spring for the Bentley manual, where do I buy one? Can I look
&gt; at my 67 Westy and copy the wiring? My buddy has a 63 SC, can I rob the
&gt; &quot;black box&quot; from it or does it need to be a 12v model? Thanks once again!
