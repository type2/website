I hate to do this but I have to put my 67 westy up for sale. It has a Full
camper interior and the only things missing are the kid cot and the rear bed
cusion. The body is fairly strait but needs rockers and floor work. Also the
left rear corner has a little bit of crunch damage , oh and the front has
damage to it but shouldnt be to hard to fix.It has a clear title but i dont
have the paper. The roof section is in great shape and  the fresh air vent
is fantastic. It has no bumpers.  The motor for it is a 1600 single port
that runs great but leaks some oil ( needs oil pump gasket). It has a
bran-spankin new 30-31 carb and almost new 009 distributor.
I need $900 or $500 with out the motor
 I know i could part it out and get more $$ but I dont have the heart to do
that.

 Thanks---Bryan     Innes_at_clickcom_dot_com
