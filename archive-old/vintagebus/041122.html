(The big piece of glass, not the movie.)

So I went to Wolfgang International today to trade up my
kingpin/linkpin/steeringknuckle things (probably reads better in
German). Nice friendly mostly longhair volks who seem to know plenty
about bus front ends. They have some real cute display counters, you
should see them. One of their guys just happened to have the piece of
glass I needed so I bought it too and that leads me to the point of
this post.

Does the rear window go in like a windshield? (Rubber seal first, then
a length of twine, then glass, then pull the rubber lip over the glass
with the twine?) Is there any adhesive or sealant used anywhere? I
seem to remember someone mentioning something about using roofing
patching product on windshields. How is that used?

I had hoped to buy that center pivot bushing reamer from Wolfgang
since they had it listed on their catalogue. I get there and the deal
is even better than that; I buy for $100, use, and return for $80 cash
back. Yahoo, problem solved! But bad luck was on to me, they were all
checked out. So I guess I won't be putting that front beam back
together and in the bus this weekend after all. I'm taking that beam
to a VW shop on Monday, I can't waste any more time trying to find one
of them darn tools.

Sunny days and cool breezes,
Joel
(wish my bus was running...)
