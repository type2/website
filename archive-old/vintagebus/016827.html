Subject: Need Help with Crankcase Ventilation Setup
Date: Sat, 24 Jun 2000 17:22:37 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

The previous owner of my 71 bus modified the crankcase ventilation system.  
The engine is not stock.  It is a single port with dual carbs and big bore 
cylinders.  It has an electric fuel pump.  The opening for the mechanical 
fuel pump has a metal cap with a hose that goes to a small box attached to 
the fan housing.  There is also a hose that goes from the oil filler cap 
area to the box.  This is the hose that would normally go to the air cleaner 
on a stock configuration.  The box also has a third tap that is plugged.

None of this seems to make any sense to me.  Both crankcase vents (the one 
from the plate covering the opening for the mechanical fuel pump and the one 
near the oil filler cap) go the box attached to the fan housing but the 
outlet from the box is plugged.

Questions:  Is this configuration ok?  Shouldn't the outlet go an air 
filter?  The air filters are these short towers made from folded paper.  If 
this isn't right, what should I do?
