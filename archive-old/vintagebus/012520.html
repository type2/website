Well after getting the tour of Southwest Galvanizing here in houston a few
weeks ago, I finally brought my rack into to be galvanized. Supposed to be hot
dipped.

Unfortunately when I brought it in, they told me they would have needed to
drill a little hole in each tube. Otherwise the racck might float. Then after
looking a little closer, they realized that the welded joints might melt in
the hot bath, then I would have a bunch of nice tubes.

SO they are going to metalize them, it is a way of spraying on a zinc coating,
they assured me it should last for quite a long time, I'll have to get an
estimate as to how long when I go back.

They are going to hot dip my side step, and mounting bars.
