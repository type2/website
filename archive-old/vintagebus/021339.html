Hey All,

  I'm finally getting around to putting a horn on my bus. It has never
had one since I've had it and I'm not sure how to go about doing it.
Since there is no horn I have nothing to go off of. I have 2 wires down
in that area . One coming out of the steering box and there is a black
and white wire not connected to anything. I don't see any other wires so
I assume that these are the wires but I'm not sure. Thanks for any
help..
Shawn
