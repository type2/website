Subject: RE: [VB] speaker size for bus

At one of the shows that some took pics at showed a 66 that had lead foam
glued to the roof under the ceiling panels and 16, 8 on each side, mini 4 oz
magnet hi quality speakers mounted behind the ceiling panel against the lead
foam. The sound was great and the eight speakers on each side were said to
surround you with sound and effectively block road and engine noise. Anyone
have pictures of this?

am i correct in assuming that a 6&quot; speaker will fit the speaker plate for a
65' bus?
