This page is a huge help to me, just x reference where possible to make
sure it's right.
E-taps_dot_com is where I get mine, if you tell him what you need, he gets
it to you, fair prices, excellent quality tools. I just fixed a redux
box bolt hole a while back.

Subject: [VB] Lug nut taps and dies...


Hello everyone,

That thread on the guy who needed a tap or die to re-thread his right
side '67 Bus spindle (I hope he was able to find what he needed - maybe
call Ronnie for a used spindle?) reminded me that I've always wanted to
locate and buy a die and tap to be able to repair any lug nuts and their
holes in the drums for both my older Busses and my Beetles.  Offhand,
does anyone know the correct size and thread pitch to order taps and
dies for the pre 1968 Type 2 Busses and also for the 1950's Type 1
Beetle's?  Besides Baum Tool, anyplace else you'd suggest to order/mail
order these goodies?Thanks again,

Bill Bowman
