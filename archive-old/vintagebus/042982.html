Yes! Use the silver anti-sieze stuff (Permatex). I have used it for
decades and it works excellently. Case in point: I just had to unbolt the
right side torsion cover bolts - I had replaced that sides broken torsion
bar in 1988 - I had antisiezed them upon assembly with the same jar of
Permatex silver stuff (the jar was new then - it still has 1/3 left) -
they came out perfectly, no siezing, no rust. When I removed the left
side's cover also last wkend, which never had been touched since the buses
production in late 66, it was a real battle on each bolt. Needless to say,
they are all coated liberally with the stuff now. 

I use it on every bolt everywhere on the bus. It saves yer butt when you
use it on the shift-coupler screws - notorious for freezing up to the
shaft.
