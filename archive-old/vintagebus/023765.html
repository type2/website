Subject: GBE Achiever crank pulley - loose fan belt - 70 Westy

Sorry to cross-post, but I posted this question earlier this week on the bay window
list, and got no responses from folks w/ a similar problem (Bob Whitby did reply
[thanks!], but his setup works fine).  I called GBE, but they weren't much help.  I'd
appreciate any input from folks who've had a similar problem.  Eye-balling my engine
while I hand turn the alternator pulley shows that my crank pulley to alt/fan pulley
is about 1:1.6 (posts in the archive say it should be 1:1.9). I am thinking of trying
too find a smaller fan belt or to shim up the alternator as possible solutions. 

original post follow:

Listees,

Even w/ all the shims out of my alternator pulley, my new (no more than 20 miles
service) Continental 9.5mm X 905mm fan belt still slips a little when I turn the
engine over w/ a wrench.  This was not a problem on my old engine, and I am curious
regarding the cause.  One of the (many) things that is different on this engine is
that I have added a Gene Berg &quot;Achiever&quot; crank pulley.  I wonder if the pulley is the
cause of the problem, and am curious if others who have used this pulley have had a
similar problem (found nothing in the archives).  My curiosity is focused on the
pulley because on the same page of the Gene Berg catalogue that shows the crank
pulley, there is a short article about how to place shims b/t the alternator/generator
and the alternator/generator stand to correct for a too-loose fan belt (p. 67, 95-96
catalogue).  While the catalogue doesn't say this, I wonder if this pulley is
manufactured in such a way that the fan belt is generally too loose w/o the described
adjustment.

The problem I am experiencing is high head temperatures (350 deg. F on my VDO CHT
gauge--engine case/tin burns my fingertips) and oil over-heating (appx. 225 deg. F
since the the GBE dipstick temp. sensor lights up) at 60 mph, appx 75-85 deg. ambient
temp.  I suspect that my fan belt is slipping since the mixture is rich (135 main jet
in 34 PICT 4 carb) and the timing correct (009 w/ total advance of 30 deg.).  Engine
is a DP 1600 cc w/ dog house cooler, all seals in place, semi-hemi heads, stock
exhaust, working oil pressure relief/control valves, valve lash .006, and Jacobs
ignition using fresh 94 octane gas.

My plan is to check my theory by seeing if belt dressing makes any difference [it
didn't], then (regardless of the belt dressing results) follow the advice in the
catalogue and try to place shims under the alternator.  If anyone has done this before
(or has a better idea), i'd be interested in your experience.  It seems as though I
should be able to do this job w/o pulling the engine (yet again).  I'd love advice on
where to obtain appropriate shim stock and the number/thickness of the shims I should
expect to use.

Thanks in advance,
