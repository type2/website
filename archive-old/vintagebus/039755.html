On my 64 Bug I have a filter with metal ends that accept the input/output 
lines with hose clamps and the center section is glass.  You can see the 
replaceable filter very clearly, and of course fuel flow, in the filter and 
it is relatively easy to replace the filters.  I would expect this to be 
stronger than the typical $1.99 plastic filter and thus far has not failed 
me.  At the risk of being flamed I think I picked it up several years ago at 
AutoZone or Pep Boys... you know the kind.  I like the recommended Marine 
filter posted earlier and will need to look into this or the tractor filter 
which will have to wait until I to visit Mom in the Oregon hinterlands.
