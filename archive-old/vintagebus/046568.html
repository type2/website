&lt;&lt; Am going to work on the suspension this weekend and after the king pin
 replacement I will try to correct about 8 inches of play in the steering. The
drag link is spent and instead of replacing the whole thing ($40 RMM) I found
some tie rod ends here in town for $8/ea. Just replacing these should take
care of this, right??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
Have you looked at your drag link?  All of the ones we have seen have only one
of the ends replaceable and the other end is welded in place.   Eric &amp; Barb
