	Thanks for the info.  As I said, it's just in the trial stages.  I don't know
about the moisture from exhaling in the van, never gave it a thought.  I am
not sure how much that will really mean here as contrary to the area you are
in, a high humidity day here is 20%.  Most of the time it is in the low teens
and everything &quot;appears&quot; to evaporate very rapidly.  As of yet I haven't
sealed the carpet pad into the walls or roof area, just have it taped up to
see how it does.  I will admit that my concerns to date have been that the
tape won't hold after the roof gets full summer sun and heats up to, oh, say,
150 degrees or so (air temps in the 120s).
	I got the van a bit over a year ago and for the previous 2 years it had been
in an enclosed storage shed, just parked and lock up.  I have found NO RUST in
any area of the van, which, leads me to believe that it has spent it's entire
life here in the desert.  I guess I'm just lucky in that area.

Jon
