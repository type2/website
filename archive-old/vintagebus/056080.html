Hey, that's right. I did have to take off a fraction of an inch on the
grinding wheel. Sorry, I forgot.

&gt; &gt; When I screw both halves together around the steering column, it's too

&gt; Hi Charles,
&gt; Along with the two body halfs of the turn signal switch there should be a
&gt; metal piece that slides into the lever handle half after installing the
&gt; switch innerds.  We apply a layer or two of electrical tape to the column
to
&gt; take up any slack.  This could also probably be done by sanding the body
&gt; halfs some so they clamp tighter.
