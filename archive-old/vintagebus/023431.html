This was Thursday around sunset.  Won't show the pictures of Steve and I on

yes, Steve H and Stephen G. showed up Thurs pm to relieve me of the 66 pop 
top westy that has been sitting in the back yard for slightly over 4 years.

Complete with 76-77 Evergreen state college parking sticker, this is a long 
time oly hippy bus purple and green.
