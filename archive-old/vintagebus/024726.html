Sorry to waste the bandwidth - but thought i would mention - this appears to be -
somewhat successful - there have been a number of people in, if not,  #buslist -
then at least some other form of channel - this server only seems to have a small
number of channels - so, if anyone interested just lists them all then you'll
easily recognize the bus channel - once i think it was call - #buslovers, and
another time #vw - though something consistent would likely be best - like maybe
#buslist (in fact there are about 5 people there now) - anyway - given that the
turn out has been smallish but consistent - it  seems that a chat room is kinda
useful - a good way for people to vent about stuff not exactly list appropriate

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Specifics:
&gt;
&gt; IRC server:             irc-2.mit_dot_edu
&gt; channel:                buslist
&gt; open:                   obviously 24/7, but aim for 0200-0500 GMT
