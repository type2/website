Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

&gt; I don't know about that, I was supposedly left a message about a canceled
&gt; order that never showed up on my machine, and I'm at home most of the time


Like I said, I've got the guys noting every single call in the customer's
file now as soon as they hang up, so it's pretty easy to confirm each call
and look up the exact details of it.  This is a recent change in policy,
maybe a few months old.  Before that, things were a bit less informal; they
made the calls but weren't required to document them other than in their own
personal notes.  This posed a problem if a customer called back when that
particular employee wasn't there.  Whoever was there had to try to deduce
why the call had been made, particularly if the only message left was &quot;Hi,
this is so-and-so, please call me back at the Bus Depot about your order.&quot;
Now they just look on the file and they know exactly who called, when, and
why. Of course no system's perfect; someone could always misdial, or forget
to note that the call that was made (in which case the call would still
happen but there'd be no record of it).  But it's about as thorough a system
as I can come up with, and I think as thorough as could reasonably be
expected.  Incidentally, very few of the calls are because an order is
canceled for unavailability. The vast majority are to inform customers that
their credit card declined.
