Hey y'all
got a good one.  Getting ready to do the brakes on the Dor and I was
wondering what the best way to get all the black gunk outta the brake
reservoir might be.  The openings are too small to stick my finger in.
I tried swishing brake fluid around but didn't loosen much at all.  Any
answers?
Dave
