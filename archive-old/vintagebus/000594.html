&lt;&lt; working on putting my 1600 back together so the old girl doesnt get towed.
 do i *need* one of these? or can i wing it? please reply asap, i have 36
 hours to start her up to prove shes worthy of being in my driveway :).
 thanks for any help.&gt;&gt;
Hi Samantha,
Not really.  You put the pressure plate on the flywheel/clutch disc, and 
tighten slightly the mounting bolts EVENLY to grip the clutch disc lightly.  
Then you can move the clutch disc until it is centered by eye looking through 
the throw out ring on the pressure plate through the clutch disc to the 
needle bearings in the flywheel gland bolt.  Even if it is a little off the 
act of installing the engine into the tranny will center it with the tapered 
end of the tranny input shaft.
 
&lt;&lt;p.s. i know youre supposed to mark the flywheel/clutch so i can line them 
up. i did that, but not using the same flywheel. so alot of good that did me 
:). thanks again.&gt;&gt;
You want to position the lightening holes in the pressure plate about 90 
degrees from the lightening holes in the flywheel.  This can make a huge 
differance to how your VW feels, and how long the engine will last.
