Subject: '57 Single Cab in TX...long
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990705083926.00798900_at_mail.flashmail_dot_com&gt;

As I mentioned a week or so ago, I'm getting a pair of late 50's single
cabs. One is a '57 and the other is a Euro '59.

I brought the '57 home today and here are my initial observations.

Like all commercial vehicles, this truck was used. That taken into
consideration,  the structure is in pretty good shape. The underside was
coated sometime early on. The coating is flaking off and reveals nice clean
paint. The exterior of the truck has surface rust all over it. It kinda
makes it look worse than it really is. There aren't many places that have
serious rust. (I think this is simular to Thom's Westy he just painted) The
body was never repainted in it's lifetime. It was originally blue. Now it's
rust colored :)   The front cab doors are in great shape. no rust holes
anywhere. I was tempted to steal them for my '59 Kombi. I'll hold off
though in case someone wants to buy the truck. The cab interior is in great
shape. Very solid cab floor with one (I think) dime size hole. The rest is
nice pretty blue. The dash is uncut. The seats are in good condition with
minimum tears. The outside door handles are missing. The bed is in great
shape. No holes. The side gates are a little beat up. The rear gate is a
lot more beat up. The deck lid is fine. The treasure chest door is a little
beat up. The treasure chest floor has a couple of holes rusted through. The
rocker on the passenger side is rusted through (what's new!). The rear
tailight are has &quot;extra&quot; lights installed. The orginal holes are still
there untouched, just no lights. The battery compartment is rusted through.
There's a rust hole in one rear corner. The nose is fine except at the very
bottom where it has a crease. The bumpers are here, but not on the truck.
They are in poor shape. Needs all new glass except the little vent windows
on each side. There's no engine.

This truck has just been sitting for a very long time. You've all seen
vehicles like this before. The good thing is &quot;what you see is what you
get&quot;. There's no bondo, bodywork, repainting, or any other surprises
waiting for you to find. It'd be a serious restoration to do. Not a truck
to have as your first bus. But it's a good candidate considering how solid
it is. It just looks ugly 'cause of the surface rust. And it needs all that
stuff like handles and glass. It's been out in dry west texas.

Even though this bus more &quot;solid&quot; than the Euro '59 I'm also getting, I
decided go ahead and sell it. I don't have the time or space to do anything
with it.I'd much rather it go to someone who's looking for a new project. 

I'm gonna try to get A LOT of pictures up real soon. I'll do my best to
show every part of the bus...good or bad. I'll let the list know when I do
and if your interested, just email me an offer. I'll sell it cheap. Just
need to make sure I've covered my own costs in saving it. More later.
