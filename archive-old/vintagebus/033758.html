Derrick, call SOUTH BAY PLATEING in Cali somewhere in the LA area. They do
all kinds of alloy and aluminum wheels. I have had Porsche FUCHS done there
and my godfather who owns a tire store use to have all the Mercedes wheels
done there. Also there is another place in Santa Ana, Cali, that also does
these wheels, they can also plate the plastic center caps. I don't know
there phone number but if you call Active Plateing (they do all my zinc
coating) the place was/is in the same complex, next to Active.


ronnie     hope this helps

ps. remember that when plateing anything that it has to be highly polished
first, so take into account that the wheels will be polished first, then
plated, which doubles the cost, so in all reality it would be better to just
polish and clear coat (cheaper) then having them plated. Or since they are
repo's just sell them and buy some new ones that are allready plated. Get
the recycler rag in So Cal and you will find platers and wheels, NO problem.

Umm.  A lot....and certianly not cheap, due to the processes involved

(memory says that the chrome will not bond to the Al. So you have to
electropate it first with a metal that will, (zinc?)...then plate THAT
with, I think, copper, and then that with the chrome.  But I probably have
the steps wrong.


&gt; that. I've seen these types of wheels chromed before,

My question is why?  Its aluminum. Polish them and clear them.  Looks a
hell of a lot better then chrome...and wont flake off the way chrome has
the ability to do.
