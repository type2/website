Hi Snoopy,
Any seal can be replaced it just depends on how much you want to take the bus 
apart.  You really need to list where the leaks are.
1. At the RGBs?
2. At the area where the axles meet the tranny center section.
3.  At the nose cone where it meets the tranny or just out the area the 
hockey stick goes into.
4.  At the rear where the engine mounts.

As for the noise first check out all of the tranny mounts for breakage and 
bolted tight.  Then check the shift rod at all of the connection points for 
loose bolts.
