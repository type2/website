my thoughts would be that it is a drain hole for any collected moisture due 
to leaks or condensation from &quot;heat&quot; (it IS a bus). VW's are full of freakish 
drain holes and weird water passages to avoid settling of amounts of water. i 
haven't looked at any of my busses, but i think they'd be there. i don't think 
that VW would want their body shops to have to replace that particular part due 
to rust-outs--it looks like it's heavily welded and scrunched in there.

sorry i forgot to more directly indicate where my hole was, it is on 
the

passenger side of the tube, right after it makes the 90 deg turn to go 
up

tpo the front of the cab. and yes it is basically like a 'u' or 'c' 
shape

cut.

Ok people, this little hole thing in 
the heater tube has been bugging me...

are we talking about the small 'C' or 'U' cut (depending on which way 
you

look at it) and it's near the cross member right after (or before, 
again

pending on which way we're going) the long straight tube???  This 
hole is

stock.  You can see a picture of mine on one of the last pictures 
of my

front beam page

And I've included a larger picture of it on my underbus page with a 
red

arrow pointing to it.
