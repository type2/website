Subject: Re: [VB] re:bumpers

&gt;I had my bumpers galvanized, so i should never have to worry about any rust
&gt;with them again. The place I brought them to-sandblasted, then acid dipped,
&gt;then galvanized.
&gt;
&gt;I plan on getting them powder coated, when I can afford it. The brightest
&gt;white that they have.
&gt;
&gt;I had the same done to my rims, belly pan, roof rack, and vw symbol.
&gt;
&gt;Now they kind of have that primer gray look to them(a little more silvery)


Are you talking about true galvanizing (hot dipped), or so-called
'electro-galvanizing' (zinc plating)?

True galvanizing can warp stamped parts, due to the intense heat involved,
but the rust protection is outstanding.

Zinc electroplating is definitely second best, but cheaper and easier.
Most new cars with gavlanized steel body parts are only electroplated, some
on one side only.
