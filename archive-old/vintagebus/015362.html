:  Could you give us a quick overview of this procedure? 

Quoting from _Volkswagen Type II Transporter Series 1200-1600 Shop
Manual_, pages 80 and 81.  My comments are in [brackets].

FWIW, I have not actually used this procedure myself.  Of course, I
also tend to go through clutches like most people go through oil.

================================================================
CLUTCH ADJUSTMENT

TO ADJUST FREE TRAVEL

To obtain the correct clearance of 0.04&quot; - 0.08&quot; between the thrust
face of the release bearing and the release plate of the clutch
pressure plate assembly, the clutch cable length should be adjusted
until the free travel measured at the clutch pedal is 0.40&quot; - 0.80&quot;.

[note that this implies a 10-to-1 travel ratio between the clutch
pedal and the throw-out bearing]

(1) Loosen back the lock nut at the threaded end of the operating
cable.  [i.e., at the transmission end]

(2) Adjust the cable length at the adjusting nut on the cable until
the clutch pedal moves freely through a distance of 0.40&quot; - 0.80&quot;
measured from the fully off position.

(3) Operate the clutch several times and recheck the measurement.
Hold the adjusting nut whilst tightening the lock nut.

(4) Smear the adjusting nut with universal grease.

[With no mention of the Bowden tube in the text, the accompanying
illustration shows the tube having a spec of 0.80&quot; to 1.2&quot; of &quot;swoop&quot;,
which is adjusted by inserting/removing washers where the tube mates
with the cable bracket on the transmission.  It also states that the
clutch lever should be inclined no more than two degrees from vertical
when the free play has been &quot;removed&quot; (presumably, taken up by
slightly depressing the pedal)]

CLUTCH OPERATING LEVER POSITION

Check the position of the operating lever on the transmission case
after adjustment of the clutch pedal free travel.  The lever position
is correct when:

(1) With the clutch engaged (pedal fully off), the threaded end of the
clutch cable should be in only light contact with the lower edge of the
countersunk hole in the lever.

(2) With the clutch released (pedal fully depressed), the threaded end
of the clutch cable should not be pressed hard against the upper edge
of the countersunk hole.

From Chassis No 225134863 (Engine No 812506) a modified clutch
operating lever together with a wing nut are fitted.  Ensure that the
lugs on the wing nut engage in the clutch lever grooves.  Cost the
wing nut with universal grease after adjustment.
