Subject: Re: [T2] first drive single port dog house

&gt; The Dual Port doghouse thermostat rod
 runs differently through the heads than the Single Port heads, does anyone
 have that answer?  I know there's others out there with that same question.

I am still looking for the answer.
I finally gave up and just use the spring to hold them open. I figure having the flaps in and open all the
time is better than no flaps at all. The outside temps here in Fresno are lukewarm to hot......
