Subject: steering box

So my steering box seems to be dripping a little too much.  It seems to work
OK but I think I'll remove it and replace any gaskets etc.. that are in
there when I park my bus for the winter.   Anyway,  my point,  so I'm using
this Amsoil synthetic gear oil 80-90 GL-4 and I get it from this old German
guy that sells Amsoil from his house, he must weigh 250 lbs and is mostly
bald except for his pony tail and he drives an 86 Westphalia 4 wheel drive
and has a 72 bus  he talks of restoring - a very cool ol' guy - only I
didn't know that there were 4 wheel drive vanagons, oh yeah, my point.  So I
have to use GL-4 for my transmission, how bout my steering box.  Is it brass
bushing or something in my transaxle?  if so,  does my steering  box have
anything like that?  I know so little ;(
