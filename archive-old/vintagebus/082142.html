Subject: new tires/trip to South America

Back on the list...gone down to South America for a month vacation...I saw a
lot of buses down there...odd configurations. I even saw a bus that had been
fitted to work on a train tracks...a bunch of the buses were 15 window(I
didn't count, but those are the ones with windows all the way around-but
none on the roof, right?)

Well I got back-and my mechanic had been doing some work on my bus while I
was gone-upgrade my braking system to dual circuit(single circuit was
leaking) &amp; new shocks. He told me I need to replace the rear brake
cylinders, and my tires on on their last legs.

I had noticed that the passenger rear tire didn't seem to wear evenly. I
thought it was due to a mis-alignment-but he said it was probably that rear
cylinder is frozen.

So I'm looking into new tires...The Bus Depot has one they strongly
recommend-has anyone gotten this tire-or have reviews?

Thanks,

-Kevin
