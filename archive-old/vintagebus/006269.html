Hello all! Just wanted to give a plug for the bus cupholders that
Robert is now manufacturing. I found mine to be very sturdy (he makes
them out of steel then rubber coats them) and really easy to install.
Also, no destruction is required in mounting to the dash.
If you are like me and always have a beverage in hand, these things
are GREAT!  I read the earlier thread about cupholders awhile back and
saw alot of good ideas, and this is one of those.  It's very easy to
install and the shape of it sort of just fits well with the style of a
splittie dash.  If your tired of the coffee can, duct tape, speaker
magnet types, this might just be the one for you!  :-)  Thanks Robert!
No more spilled coffee!!!
