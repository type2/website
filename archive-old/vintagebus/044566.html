&lt;&lt;They apparently operate in different temp ranges. So I will need to take 
out the sender appropriate to the gauge that I harvest. Where would I find

Hi Michael,
Yes, there are differant ranges of gauges made by VDO.  We only buy as a  
standard 0-80 Lbs. sq. pressure gauges and the temp gauges that reads up to 
300F.  Then as we said before we just buy the senders new.  So we do not know 
where the senders for water cooled are under the hood.  Plus make sure that 
these senders are threaded the same as the ACVW oil pressure sender for the 
oil idiot light.
 
&lt;&lt;Can the oil temp sender be tested like a water temp sender ie. by putting 
it into a pot of boiling water to determine its accuracy round the water 
boiling point?&gt;&gt;
 Yes, it can if you wire it properly.  Hose clamp a ground wire around the 
sender to complete the circuit.  We have a nice OLD Stork made (Looks by it's 
face it was made for Porsche.) mechanical temp gauge that we have checked the 
calibration with this gauge in boiling water.  Since it is the type that one 
just sticks it's sender in the oil dipstick tube we used it to varify our oil 
temp gauges in our engines at least once a year.  This way we just go from VW 
to VW checking them each in a couple of minutes with no fuss or muss!  Have 
heard you can pick up highly accurate thermometers from the scientific 
catologs for very little $ that are long and skinny enough to reach into the 
oil through the dipstick tube which would be another good way to go about 
this.

&lt;&lt;BTW harvesting a gauge and buying a new sender from the dealer(which has 
gotta be the most expensive place)is still about a third of the price of a 
new VDO kit. &gt;&gt;
You bet!  We just picked up four good used gauges (At least they passed the 
jar test to make sure the needles are not frozen in them.) a new presure 
sender and temp sender still in thier packages and a used pressure sender 
thrown in for free.  All for $30.00 at Portland International raceway this 
last Sunday!  Saw lots of other center mounted underdash VWWC gauge consols 
for sale out there with all thier gauges still in them.  Eric&amp;Barb
