&lt;&lt; You've suggested that the larger venturied 30 PICT-1 was not used on 1500cc

Hi Gene,
Thanks for the excellant info.  We were more suggesting that the 28 PICT-1 
was not used past the 1500cc engine and mainly due to the smaller 22.5 dia. 
venturi, but that was not the question Diana was pondering..  The 30 PICT-1 
was used on 1300-1500 engines and has the same 24mm dia. venturi that the 30 
PICT-2 used on the later 1600 SP engines.
