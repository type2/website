I don't know about the longevity of the Optima (and similar) gel-cell
batteries, but they're readily available at most FLAPS around here.

A major attraction is their sealed case which theoretically makes them
immune from gassing off and/or dribbling electrolyte.  They've been
heavily marketed for several years in the Puget Sound area for marine
installations, and are claimed to function even when upside down or
submerged.  Given the properties of salt water I'm skeptical about the
submerged operation unless the cables and terminals were totally sealed
as well.

The main market for those sold at FLAPS seems to be boy racer types who
want them for their &quot;kewl&quot; factor.....
