actually- picture me in 105 degrees,  jeans, steel toed workboots, flannel 
shirt buttoned up to my neck and wrists, ear muffs over the ear plugs, eye 
protection, sweat running off my nose, dust, hose running to deal with 
sparks/possible fires/  hosed myself down so I didn't turn into a raisin, did 
you see the pic in the OBR of the half a bus on the roof rack of my westy?
