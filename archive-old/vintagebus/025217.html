&gt; Hi bussers,
&gt;
&gt; All this talk about gear oil, it's about time I bit the bullet and changed
&gt; mine. My book says use SAE90 oil, but all I can find in the shops is 90LS


We installed another bus tranny today and I swiped the info on gear oils
suppled to us by our trans builder:


&quot;CAUTION! This trans must be filled with only 80 or 90 weight GL-4 Rated
oil, NOT GL-5, NOT GL-6, NOT GL-3-4-5, NOT GL 4-5-6! Use of any oil
other than straight GL-4 voids the warranty on the synchronizers! GL-4
oil is available from Pennzoil, Valvoline, Castrol, and many other
manufacturers.  Do not be talked out of GL-4 by your local supplier who
may not have it! VW and Audi synchros were designed for GL-4 oil, and
any use of GL-5 will cause hard shifting and possibly damage to the
unit. Really! Trust us on this one.

We also highly recommend Redline MT-90 synthetic for easier shifting.
This is the only oil other than the correct GL-4 that will not void the
warranty on the trans.&quot;

This is from
German Transaxle of America, formerly Volkstrans
61560 American Lane
Bend, OR 97702
541-382-7723
800-892-4327

 We buy about 25 transaxles a year from these guys. They are good.
