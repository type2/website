Hey folks,

Just got a new computer at home and after bringing home some personal files
from work, I found some cool VW stuff that I had downloaded but never used.

First there is a splittie startup screen (as your computer is booting up)
that replaces the Win95,98 logo with a front-view sketch of an old Type II
in Windows colors - pretty cool!

I also found a folder of VW cursors. Some are .ani files, so you can use
them as an animated &quot;busy&quot; cursor (there's a bug with a surfboard driving
along, a baja bug cruising over some bumps, and a VW engine firing up).

I've tried them all with no problems. I believe I downloaded them from
someone's VW site, but I'm not sure whose - perhaps someone on the list?

Anyway, I like having a little VW look to my computer and thought I'd pass
it along. If you're interested, email me and I'll send them to you, along
with instructions.
