&lt;&lt; I haven't been posting much 'cause I've been too busy working.  The
 gaskets for the skylight in the Dormobile top were so old they were
 porous.  The rain actually seeped THROUGH the gasket.  I removed the
 skylights to renew the gasket.  Funny thing is nobody has anything even
 close.  It is shaped like an H, 3/4&quot; wide, the glass and top are 1/8&quot;
 thick.  The spacing between the 2 channels is 3/16&quot;.  I've been to Auto
 glass, camper shells, camper supply, hardware, marine supple and repair,
 and a gasket supply company.  It's kinda embarrassing to get laughed at
 when you show the salespeople what you're looking for.
 
 O great and venerable listees, do any of you know of a source of about
 25 feet of this elusive material?
