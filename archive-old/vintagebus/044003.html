I'd just like to comment that I personally do not like to use an amp
gauge.  Murphy's law.  When the elec. lead wears thru the grommet and
shorts on the body opening.....big time elec. mess, smoke, melted wires
and fire.  I don't like the idea of all that elec. energy coming up to the
dash in one single wire.  I recommend a voltmeter.
