Now, it's not Friday yet but heck, I can't keep it to myself
anymore!!!!!!!!!
I did go to WallMart like some of you did and right on the shelf, there were
no VW sets at all. I looked up and there it was, on the top shelf and all
the way on top of the pile!! I found a clerk, she brought a ladder, got up
there and fished-out 4 more of these babies. I got all five!!!!! plus two
sets of the new 1/58 minis that are called &quot;Action Radar&quot;. Five cars total
in a pack Bus and Bug including. I've got the Green one and Richie's Pizza
already. Man, what a day!!! I had to get Lucille Ball - Barbie for wifey as
well so she won't cry and Mr. Potato Head for my daughter. My son is
drooling all over the Bus with the trailer already.
Now it's gonna be easier to convince my wife to go and pick up my new bus
from OKC. She loves the set-up from Road &amp; Track.

Life is beautiful,

Andre
