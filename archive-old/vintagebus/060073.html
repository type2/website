Subject: Re: [VB] gear poppin' 

Time to start saving for a tranny. My old 67 actually had a po fabed custom
bracket bolted between the walk through seat with a finger that stuck out to
hold it in fourth. I drove it for more than a year like that but eventually
it quit working too. If it gets to bad a bunge cord will also work
temporarily until you have $ for a real fix.



but i'm still popping out of
&gt; 4th a bit. Is there some other adjustment I can make?
&gt; Perhaps at the rear shift-rod coupler? How does one
&gt; make this adjustment? thanks for any help,
&gt; -russ henry
