Hi Guys,

Steering wheel is centred by adjusting (shortening or
lengthening) the drag link arm.  Adjusting the tie rods
will later your toe-in and thus your wheel alignment.

Steve, clean up yout pittman arm and you will see 
a little line scored on it.  Clean up the arm on the steering
box and you see another little indexing line.  Index the
two lines and put your pittman arm back on.

Now tighten up the adjustment screw on your steering
box (just a little too tight).  Turn the steering wheel.
Your will find a point where it tightens or 'grabs' and this
is the 'middle' of your range of adjustment.

Now center your wheel by adjusting the drag link arm.
Now readjust your steering box and you're cooking.

&gt; &gt;Speaking of turns to lock, I recently popped off the pittman arm(correct
&gt; &gt;name???) so I could straighten the wheel (wasnít too successful as there
&gt; &gt;is too much play in the center pivot).  Upon centering up the wheel I
&gt; &gt;reinstalled the arm.  To my dismay, I must have turned the wheel too many
&gt; &gt;times as my turn to the left is WAY to short!  I think the QEII could
&gt; make
&gt; &gt;a left hand U turn in less space.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in
&gt; its
&gt; &gt;throw??  How many turns from lock does the output shaft have to go to get
&gt; &gt;centered??
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that the pitman arm in NOT supposed to be removed and reindexed.
&gt; Seems to me that the splines are sometimes made (on some cars) with one
&gt; different from the rest, so that there is only ONE way to put the pitman
&gt; arm on.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that the CORRECT way to center your wheel is to loosen all of
&gt; the
&gt; tie rod end clamps and rotate the tie rods with a pipe wrench or similar
&gt; tool.  Each tie rod has a right-handed thread on one end, and a
&gt; left-handed
&gt; thread on the other end, like a turnbuckle.  This means that turning the
&gt; tie rod will cause the length between the tie rod ends to grow shorter or
&gt; longer as the tie rod is twisted.  By shortening one tie rod while
&gt; lengthening the other tie rod, the centering of the steering wheel can be
&gt; affected.  Don't forget to reset your toe-in before tightening up your tie
&gt; rod end clamps.
