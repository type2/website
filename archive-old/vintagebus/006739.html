I was told that all octanes and additives are added when loading in a truck
(by the owner of parker oil), he has raw fuel in which they add the
necessary components to bring the fuel up to what the goverment requires. I
did a fuel test going to kelly park when busavaning with VWHoward, he always
uses premium fuel where as I was useing regular for half the trip. the only
performance problem that I could notice was a loss of about 1-2 mpg by
useing the lower octane fuel, This could become a greater cost on a long
trip due to more consumption of gas, but if I used 1 gallon more useing
regular verses premium with premium costing up to 40 cents a gallon more in
a 10gallon tank it would cost 4.00 more for premium in a fill up the 1.60
for the extra gallon of regular used. So I have become a regular gas kind of
guy and say the hell with the high fuel prices. On a 1300 mile trip it would
become quite the savings. probally enough to rent a hotel room to take a
shower in after 3 days on the road! Never have tryed a truck stop shower
before.

&gt; I think I can shed some light here, I work for a fuel company in Phx. We
haul 
&gt; for a lot of places, I was shocked to find out that Chevron is the only
place 
&gt; that uses a set of racks, no one else can load from these racks, 76 has
its 
&gt; own rack, and Arco has its own rack. Now Arco, and 76 both sell to any
one! 
&gt; So you could be at a local &quot;independent&quot; type store and get 76 gas. Now
this 
&gt; is my point! We have a set of racks called Kinder (Censored), we've hauled

&gt; for 6 different stations out of this one set of racks.

Shhh!  You're giving away the secret!  All of these companies have gone to
great lengths and expense to give the public the idea that their fuel is
somehow superior to others.  In fact, the suppliers share and trade
fuel freely, pipe it from here to there in the same pipelines, etc.  Next
thing you know you'll have the bus folk all buying from the cheapest
stations because they will all know that the fuel is the same!  :)

&gt; The octane is the same for each different grades of gas unlead is 87 mid
is 
&gt; 89 and high grade is 96. Some times we will be loading and the octane
alarm 
&gt; will go off at the minimal amount and will not inject any more then that,

This is a new one on me.  Is there a device that will detect the octane of
a fuel (normally determined on a calibrated test engine) on the fly?  Or
is the device simply a mechanical proportioning device?
