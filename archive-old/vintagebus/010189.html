I thought I'd might as well chime in:
67 Kombi &quot;Creepy Crawler&quot; used for my work truck for 3 years until I got my
DC. It has rust on the right hand rocker which is next on the list to be
fixed. Currently painted white but will get as Velvet Green lower paint to
match the interior. I have a westy interior that is going in but recovered
all white.

68 Westy 6 wheeled Stretch with 60 panel welded on top Buick V-6 powered
&quot;Frankenbus&quot; (whew) This will be my bus tow car and conversation piece when
is gets parked next to Kyle's Westfailure. Body is super straight and just
has some surface rust under the windshield.

68 Double Cab My every day drive and work truck. This thing has been
faithfully transporting myself to work and my daughter and I to various
shows and campouts on the west coast for 3 years. It's in fair shape but it
has a new engine going in on Monday.

Many others in the past including 71 Deluxe with a Corvair 140  hp engine,
71 Westy with 912 Porsche engine, 75 Westy with 3.8 V-6.
