To Trevor and the List,

Alas, it is I who purchased the LAST of the PIP bus racks a few months ago.
When I first called, Greg told me I was lucky that I has called because they
weren't going to be making any more for about 4 years.

I asked why, and he said that it was because he was too busy making the New
Beetle roof racks.  Greg even went as far to say that he has sold more New
Beetle racks in 6 months, than he has sold bus and bug racks combined for
the past 2 YEARS!

He did mention a deal with VWOA to manufacture &quot;official&quot; racks for the new
beetle.  He also said that VW would not allow wood slats on the racks, and
he had to use a plastic resin material for the slats - interesting eh?

He also said that if there was enough demand, they WOULD CONSIDER a limited
run of the vintage racks, however at about 100$ more a pop.  But this could
not be done for at least a couple years.

It took a long time to get my Bus rack from them, the 1st time they shipped
it, it came back to them from UPS damaged, and Greg had to get more aluminum
rods MADE to get mine back out to me because they had already sold all the
other racks.  There were absolutely no more rack parts lying around the
shop!


So there you have it folks, no more PIP vintage racks.  Unless you wish to
buy a lot of them, and pay DEARLY at that!

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW  &quot;In ten
years, my car will still be a classic, yours will just be OLD.&quot;

Or my current favorite: &quot;Does YOUR car have a sink?&quot;
