All this talk about which is rarer and which has more value Jim hits it
on the nose. I have a Type Three Ghia factory electric sunroof. The only
one that resides in California that runs, works and is not in a junkyard
cut up. It is also one of 10 64' model year known to exist and one of 40
all production years 63-69. I can't get rid of it and it is an
incredibly cool car. It's just not desirable.

Also I believe I have seen maybe only one 55-58 SWR-CNB deluxe in the
shows and a few pics of others and heard of one more (plus mine) out of
all the countless 59-63 deluxes and the several barndoor deluxes that
I've seen out there. So I would think that those years (55-58) would be
more rare as far as Deluxes go. Or maybe they just don't get restored as
much. Just wait till mine hits the scene. And it's gonna be a driver.
With repsect of course.

&gt; Yeah after marketing the snot out of that bus I
&gt; figured that I would wait until the thing was on the
&gt; boat. Yup it sold. Yup, still maintain that it was a
&gt; very nice bus for what it was. Solid driver, excellent
&gt; mechanicals. Cursed because of the lack of a big rear
&gt; deck.
&gt; Heard from a Japanese gentleman at last weekend's OCTO
&gt; that the barnambulator, or campulance as the VTO guys
&gt; call it, has already been featured in a couple mags as
&gt; part of the American Scene and OCTO/Classic Weekend
&gt; report.
&gt; Had to chuckle at today's discussion over 21 vs 23 and
&gt; supposed &quot;value&quot; based upon rarity in numbers. If
&gt; based soley on numbers with a dash of early vintage as
&gt; factors then the ambulances in whatever current
&gt; config/condition and specialty vehicles would be the
&gt; hot ticket. Basically it boils down to the trendiness
&gt; in the market. Notice that I failed to use the word
&gt; hobby. The ambulance was one of 500 or so barney ambos
&gt; produced between 1952-2/1955. Only 24 currently known
&gt; to be taking up space on the planet.
&gt; Before everyone who currently owns, once owned, ever
&gt; wanted to own a deluxe bus, ever walked by a deluxe or
&gt; is currently marketing a deluxe bus crawls up my arse~
&gt; PLEASE understand that I like deluxes. I think that
&gt; their only fault is that they are such a b*tch to camp
&gt; in with all of that sunlight coming in! I watched Tom
&gt; Brioulette try to sleep in April, his former and
&gt; beautiful deluxe, at an early Jerome. He crawled out
&gt; all bent, hunched over and folded in the morning.
&gt; Living in Phoenix Arizona with over seven months of
&gt; intense heat screaming in on you and a deluxe bus, to
&gt; me, makes no sense. More than likely would result in a
&gt; red~ neck. ;-) Phoenix has too many already.
&gt; Yes, I would have loved to have held on to the bus and
&gt; yes, the wolves have been pushed back a few feet. No,
&gt; not rich- sold the thing for the reasons that were
&gt; tauted for months- paying the bills and helping Mom to
&gt; stay home and raise our baby for as long as we can
&gt; manage. It's a nice trade. =) I'll take my girls over
&gt; metal any day.
