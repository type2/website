Subject: now that I know what to do, how should I do it?

Hello again list(s),

     Now that I know what to do, how should I go about doing it?  Here is 
what I am going to figure on doing, and I'd appriciate any comments on it, 
and, I also have some questions:

I am going to take out the motor, take off the head/jugs, and have a look 
see.  What should I do (in detail) while I am doing this (what should I look 
for, how should I do things, etc).  I figure I will stop there and reply 
back to the list to see what they think.  Should I go all the way and just 
split the case and try to see whats up and start over?  Again, what should I 
look for other than real obvious signs of wear?  Now, I assume that the 
motor will need rebuilt, and a few months ago, I e-mailed the list asking 
about a list of tools to have on hand (other than the &quot;regular&quot; &quot;obvious 
ones&quot; like metric wrenchs/sockets etc)when rebuilding a motor, but the 
replys were lost.......  I have calipers, and ring compressers, what else 
should I need?  We dont do much engine repair on our farm, mainly drive 
train, frame/subframe, electrical, hydraulic/fuel and various repairs like 
that.  We normally send motors to my dads nephew.

I dont want to get to far ahead, so I'll send some more e-mails after I get 
back and see whats up with the motor.  I have finals to worry about....

Thanks for all the responds to the first e-mail!
Matt
