Hey Everyone,

My trip to Busses By the Bridge VIII (BBB8) this last weekend was great! 
 I met some new friends, had fun with a few old friends from back in the 
mid-west, found some good swap items, and much more!

The fun started out Wednesday night at my place in ABQ with the arrival 
of several members from the Colorado Bus Club contingent. It was nice 
seeing the caravan of Bus headlights (plus one Toyota Camery) coming 
down the dirt road to our property!  Went out for a nice dinner and then 
came back to the house to crash.  Got up early next morning to see 
everyone off, and then made final preparations to leave myself.

I had made plans to caravan with the Albuquerque Air Alliance guys, and 
we met up around 0900 Thursday morning, except for Shawn, who was busy 
getting directions to everything down on paper before leaving.  We hit 
the road somewhere around 0930, with cold temps and some light rain. 
 The rain turned to snow as we made our way west, but the temps were not 
low enough to do any harm.  I was glad that I had purchased new wipers 
before leaving - they came in handy!  The weather cleared out nicely as 
we made our way past Flagstaff.

Only trouble I had with the camper ('74 with dual Solex carbs) was rough 
running at constant speed early on in the trip.  I thought it was odd 
after all the tuning up I had done the weekend before.  The beast had 
normal power to climb and accelerate, though, which struck me as odd. 
 At our first gas stop I did some poking around in the engine bay and 
discovered the 12V lead to the idle cutoff switch had come off, leaving 
the LH carb with only the main cutoff valve lead still connected! 
 Plugged it back on and the Bus ran as great as I expected it to.  I 
love it when problems are simple!

By the time we had reached Winslow, AZ the caravan was breaking up.  I 
didn't want to drive my Bus as hard as the rest of the ABQ boys, so I 
started letting off and drifting back some, hoping to catch the Colorado 
gang who I knew were driving more my speed.  We had passed them in 
Holbrook, so I knew they would be along shortly.  Right as we were 
pulling out of the fuel stop in Winslow there they were!  So I jumped 
caravans and made my slow way with the Jim, Darrel, and Bret and Martha 
from Colorado.  We made it past Flagstaff without any trouble, and on to 
the camp site out in the sticks near Seligman.  Had a nice dinner and 
chat, and also a nice stroll out in the cool night.  The star scene was 
absolutely beautiful!

Shortly after we had pulled into the field and set up camp we had some 
visitors.  Turns out they were the folks who owned the land we thought 
was BLM land.  They were very nice and told us we could camp there so 
long as we did not leave any trash and burned no fires.  The night was 
cold (fire was tempting)!  When we got up temps were in the mid-20s, and 
yes, there was frost on the INSIDE of the windows!  I sure was not 
disturbed in my sleep, though, as I had come prepared with many blankets 
and a nice down comforter and pillow.  I was not cold at all!  Until I 
got up to put on clothes!  Speaking of getting up, we had planned on 
waking about 0700.  Well, we all, except for Darrel, had slept in a 
little.  I was wakened by the sound of an engine firing up!  That worked 
much better than coffee!  This reminded me of the time I went to the 
Springfield, MO show a couple years back.  The Saturday morning of the 
show I went in to the bathroom to freshen up and when I came out 
everyone was gone!

So, we got going from the campsite and made our way to breakfast and 
gas.  And then on in to Havasu from I-40.  Getting into the show site 
was interesting with all the road construction going on.  We sat at an 
intersection for about 15 minutes while the crew did &quot;something&quot; that 
prevented us from passing.  Wasn't too bad of a wait, though, with the 
nice temperatures and view out over the lake towards California.  Just 
as the daydreaming got good it was time to move on, and so we found our 
way into the show site.  Set up camp in a great spot under some trees, 
and just kicked back and watched the Busses roll in.

I found out sometime after my arrival that one of the guys in the 
original ABQ caravan had indeed blown his engine on the last leg of the 
trip into Havasu!  They were about 40 miles out, apparently, when 
George's Bus lost power, and started belching smoke and oil.  He had it 
towed to the show site.  Saturday he and a few others installed JP's 
spare engine so George could make it back home under good power.  How 
fast were those guys driving when the engine went?  I know nothing!! 
 ;-)  Luckily for them JP was carrying the spare.  That's the second 
show I've been to where that spare engine came in handy.

It was during this Friday time that I ran into Leo and Ed from Tulsa, 
and Rob Lafoon from Omaha, and Wade and Doug from somewhere in the 
middle states!  It sure was nice to see some familiar mid-west faces 
amongst all the new faces.  Friday night was filled with fun, food, 
drink, and a lot of great conversations with all kinds of Volks from all 
over the western states.  Made my way to bed sometime between 2300 and 
midnight, and slept well.  This was after the fireworks, fortunately!

Got up early Saturday morning.  Had my breakfast and fun watching the 
sun come up, and the campers wandering out of their sleepiness.  And the 
show as on!  More Busses kept rolling in to supplement the fine 
collection that was already there.  I think we had somewhere near 220 
Busses, counting both official and unofficial entries.  Some of my 
favorites:

- A early '63 double door eleven window, with Turquis and Blauweiss 
paint scheme to match my 15 window.  I really like those colors, and 
this Bus was restored very nicely.  It even had the correct double flip 
down middle bench!  Nice Bus.

- A 1960 Mango paint scheme eleven window Bus in all original condition. 
 This Bus was in from Sacramento, CA.  Tim was the owner, and was very 
happy to give me the tour of his very cool Bus.  After seeing Bernie's 
Mango a while back I have decided that this too is one of my favorite 
paint schemes on the older Splitties

- A very nicely restored '57 double door panel.  This one was in Dove Blue.

- Saw a cool '57 (I think) Binz double cab.  This one was not restored, 
but was still very nice and more attractive to me than the restored 
example I have had the privilege of seeing.  I must say, I really enjoy 
seeing these older Busses in presentable original condition.  If the Bus 
has been hit or has lots of rust, restore it.  But if it's original and 
still pretty straight and solid, leave it be!  Just some of my soapbox 
opinion there.

- And I cannot leave out the totally cool right hand drive '66 (or was 
it '64?) SO-42  camper from New Zealand!  This Bus is almost like new! 
 And what a cool camper setup that SO-42 is.

Other Bus highlights:

- The extended length, Chevy 350 powered &quot;Westfailure&quot; from California.

- Ronnie's fire truck and Australian container Bus.

- Nice 15 window Bus with roof top tent setup.

In general it was nice to be surrounded by so many Busses for a couple 
days!  And this camp/show site was definitely one of the best I have 
been to.  The beach on the lake was great, with the nice view over the 
water towards California.  The weather was nice with the possible 
exception of Friday night, when the wind kicked up and made some mess of 
things.  And Saturday got off to a cool, windy start that slowly died 
down and turned into a beautiful sunny warm afternoon.

I found some nice things at the swap.  Got an old church key with its 
holder.  Found a great pair of early, early walk through seats and 
splash pan for the '58 (thanks Lou from Sacramento).  And also located 
an item I had been looking for for quite some time.  This little gem is 
for the camper - a prop for the back hatch.  It's great to be able to 
hold the back hatch open part way in warm weather, and this device does 
so by connecting to the latch mechanism on the hatch and body.  When in 
use it is totally secure - you cannot remove the prop unless you operate 
the latch as you normally do to open it up.  Very nice piece of work!

And then there was Saturday night.  The trivia contest was a ton of fun! 
 They came up with some really odd Bay questions and I was surprised to 
see how much of it JP really knew.  That's funny with him being so much 
more associated with the old Splitties.  I had to check into that &quot;5.5 
turns of the Bay's window crank&quot; question - it's true.  Lots of good fun 
was had that night.  Let's see, beside all of the great conversation 
there was more fireworks.  And yes, &quot;CAUTION DOG&quot;  was in effect!  Old 
Caution ended up with some glowy stuff in strange places after a visit 
to the guy with the blanket's camper for a few minutes!  I'll let him 
and the other witnesses tell more of that story!

I went to bed fairly early, knowing that I had a long drive ahead of me 
the next day.  Slept well for sure, and got up early, made my 
preparations and farewells, and hit the road about 0800.  Made the trip 
to ABQ in 10 hours and 15 minutes including my stops for gas and food, 
arriving in the Rio Grande Valley at 1815.  Got ten hours of sleep last 
night and am now getting ready to get back to work.

Ohh, and how can I forget the &quot;lookin' for party&quot; man that came through 
the campground Friday night.  This guy came rolling right into the 
middle of the camp site in a Isuzu 4X4 type thing, right up to where Lou 
of Havasu and I were talking.  He kept asking me &quot;where can I find some 
party?&quot;, and I just kept telling him to look around, that the party was 
happening everywhere.  He finally gave up on me and approached several 
others.  Turns out the guy was looking for cocaine or meth.  Just ask 
the guy with the blanket!  We later got together and tried to find him 
and run him off, but by then he was already gone.  We all think that 
this guy was in fact an under-cover looking for trouble.  I am glad that 
he did not find what he was looking for in our big bunch of happy VW 
peoples.

Take Care!  See you at Havasu next year!
