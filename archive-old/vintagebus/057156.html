Subject: Re: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

My 1960 DD panel is all original paint 'cept for the top couple layers...

&gt; I'm sure they're meaning that any replacement was done with original or
&gt; original-style parts.  My Beetle is original, not FACTORY orginial, but I
&gt; have only direct copies or literal replacement parts on it.  Sort of like
&gt; saying, the paint is factory paint, or the paint is an original color. 
&gt; Maybe sound the same, but are quite different.
