&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a good description of a flip-seat Westy?
 What SO# was it? Which years? What options? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
We have images we can send to you if you want of the owners manual.  Due to
some volks out there having slower computors we will not post them here.
SO-34 &amp; 35 and were produced from 1961-63 and there after were special order
only in 1964-65. Tons of options that included small cabana tent, westie roof
rack, ambulance fans, childs cot, white gas stove, folding chair, and lots of
others.  We are trying to find these westies to add to our registry to both
figure out how many of these strange campers are still out there and to help
volks to find interior parts for thier flip-seat westies.    Eric &amp; Barb
