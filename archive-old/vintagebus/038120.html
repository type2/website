Hi everybody,
     I was looking at my doors for the 57 today and one looked a little beat. 
Both have been beaded/zinc coated and were rust free , but I was thinking 
about replacing one of them. What are decent 57 doors going for these days? 
How much to ship it? Or should I spend a little elbo grease and bondo to make 
it nice?  Also does anyone have an center brakelight assembly? I know the 
lenses are available.
                                                                 Steve
