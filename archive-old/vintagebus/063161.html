Subject: Camper Bed

Hiya gang,
I have been trying to find a complete interior for my 67 Sundial.  No luck.
My son just bought a 66 Sundial, and although the interior is rough, we can
use it to pattern off of and build us each a new interior from scratch.  We
will have to make some adjustments since his Sundial is a bench seat model,
and mine is a walk-thru.

Anyway, the one element that I don't have to do this is the folding bed
unit.  Does anyone know if I could use a Westy folding bed, or even a bed
from a Bay Window?  Or does anyone know where I could latch onto a Sundial
Bed?

Any help would be appreciated.

Ed
