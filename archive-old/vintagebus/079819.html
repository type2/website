I'll add a &quot;here, here&quot; to Sean's comment. I didn't want the 3.88 &amp;
went with the 4.12. It's a nice ratio. The 4th is a bit tall (large
gap between 3rd &amp; 4th) but not enough to worry. I cruise all day at 65
up/down TN,NC,VA hills and have NO problems. It's a good combo for a
stock/mild engine.
