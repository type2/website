&gt; I was trying to find a set of panel cargo doors when I got the panel.  A
&gt; few people had them, and wanted Big Bucks.  The panel came with the low
&gt; hinge doors, which I can't use, which are suddenly now as common as super
&gt; beetle talights.

Allright, I'll give you $50 for them. But I don't want to pay shipping,
bring them to Havasu, okay? I figure I can plant them in the yard next to
the other buses and maybe they'll grow into a panel.
