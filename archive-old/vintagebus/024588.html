Subject: anti-theft part 2

}}My door handles are disconnected too. It drives passengers nuts, and
hitchhikers seem to get a little freaked out when I am letting them off,
ya know they reach for the door, and there aint nothin to grab!
My handles are off due to a project gone lazy, but I have often wondered
how they would fare with thieves. Imagine someone getting in then
realizing they had no way out!}}

I had to respond to this post because it reminded me off a funny story. 
While in the Air Force, I bought a beautiful 1960 vw. She was my baby so 
I immediately started to &quot;customize&quot; the interior (I was 19). So I pulled 
all the door panels out and I was driving around with one handle for the 
doors and windows. We would just pass it around when we needed it. So it 
also needed brakes and try as I mught, I could not get the big nut off 
the back drums. Had the biggest breaker bar in the world with three guys 
on it and it wouldnt budge. So I took the brake parts and dropped it off 
at a shop.

When I picked it up, the mechanic said he had gotten in to bleed the 
brakes and couldnt get out!! He couldnt find the handle. He finally 
banged on the window so hard a passer-by let him out.

I thought I would get a big bill, but he charged me thirty some bucks 
(this was twenty five years ago).

Now lets see, where is that bus content. . . oh yeah, I cannot find 
reverse in my 65. Once in a while I can get it: the rest of the time I 
try and try and can't find it. All other gears seem good. Linkage??
