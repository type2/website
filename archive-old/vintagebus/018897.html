You bring up a valid point: I see/hear/read a lot of people make
statements along the lines of &quot;hey, it's still a volkswagen, so I
love it&quot; - why?   What obligation could one possibly feel toward
a car company, just because they made a model 40 years ago that
you like?  What could one possibly gain from such bizarre &quot;consumer
loyalty&quot;?    If you're not in the market for a new Jetta/Passat/etc
then you're no more than yesterday's baked beans on the wind as far as
VW is concerned.  VW used the bug enthusiasts like a drunken sorority
girl to pimp the NB, and they're getting ready to do the same to
old bus people as well.  They'll use the bus crowd as an ad prop, then
forget about them just as quickly.

People seem to forget that at the *EXACT* same time as they were
working the nostalgia angle to sell NB's, they were also shutting
down ACVW web sites.

Yet the trancelike chants of &quot;VWOA/VW AG is cool&quot; continue to spew
from the air cooled red-headed stepchildren.  Sure, they contributed
to a couple of shows - so they could pimp out more new beetles.  

I realize they're in the business of selling cars.  So is GM, Ford,
Chrysler/Daimler, Honda, Oldsmobile (RIP).  And as far as I'm
concerned, they're all on the same level.  I would be better
off buying a new GM or Ford truck than a new VW - at least I could drag home
buses with a spankin' new dually.

&gt; Don't you forget that the Volkswagen of today is NOT the Volkswagen of old...not even close.  That Volkswagen died stopped supporting the older cars and completely divested themselves from their past.  Well at least until they could exploit it for the NB.
