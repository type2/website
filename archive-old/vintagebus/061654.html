Subject: Re: [VB] June 9 Super Jam at Maple Grove (Pa.)-Finding eastern PA ACVWS 
 lately.

There's a customized, lowered Dove Blue early-60s doublecab with PA
historic tags that makes a lot of the shows in Penna. and Virginia. 
Very nice paint job.

Judging from attendance at VW shows the last few years, there just
aren't many splittie buses in show condition in this region.

&gt; Are there going to be ANY restored to stock buses (or even nice
&gt; custom...) splitties there? I MIGHT be ready or finishing up for next
&gt; year...
