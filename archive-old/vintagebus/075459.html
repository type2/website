&gt;Fortunitly not!

Cool, I thought this might be possible, but I've never done it.  I was
thinking the Bentley says you have to pull the engine and transmission,
but a closer re-read shows that's only if you want to get the whole shift
rod out.  My rear coupler seems to be in decent shape and hopefully I
won't have to try this for a while.
