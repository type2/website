Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Speeding, Cooling, and Over-reving

I bought a cable with 4 wires in it, WRAPPED in a black plastic casing...cost 
under $10...I ran this from near the fuse box into the engine compartment of 
my 61... used for

oil pressure  
oil temp

then I added

tach
euro (two tone) taillights (needed an extra wire run for brake lights as the 
brake circuit is now separate from the turn signal wires)  (ya, a PO put in 
62-71 lights, I installed the euro version)

I might yank the tach and install cylinder head temp... I know where it tachs 
now.

The oil pressure and temperature are a little more involved, but still
doable.  If you decide you're going to run a lot of gauges, you might
try to get some multi-wire cable.  It's commonly sold as trailer light
cable with four 14 or 16 gauge wires; if you dig around a little you
can find cables with more wires.  With the cable, you can run the wire
for up to four gauges (excluding cylinder heat temperature) at once.
