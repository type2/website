ok....i have to agree with DuvBlau and the other people. there is support for
hacking up buses for no real reason , when you can just go out and buy a 23
window. as Mike said, alot of projects are left for dead for lack of interest
once its half way through. but when it comes to lowering, thats &quot;ruining&quot; a
bus?? i think not...my bus is lowered WITH IRS ......bla
....its so wrong to have IRS and lower the bus , when its perfectly ok to junk
buses and hack up some models to &quot;make&quot; another model..

I don't think  anyone is going to take a roof off a good 21/23 window deluxe
to weld it on another bus- way too much work.     I also don't think it is all
that easy to go out and buy a 23 window.   Last time I checked, there aren't a
ton of them driving around with for sale signs.  Yes, there was one in a
Seattle (kinda local for me) paper for sale- a project for over $3000, and a
listee is driving up here to drag it back to California.     I wrote what I
did about the roof transplant to talk about how much friggin work is involved-
but I also believe that it is good for people to have information, which is
why  I wrote about ways people lower buses, although I think it is a
dumb*ssb%tt thing to do.   

I don't even like sunroof deluxes all that much.   Those dumb skylight windows
up front let the sun glare in my eyes (people up north aren't used to that
bright orb and may consider it dangerous, BTW), and the buses all are rotted
badly it seems,    I was somewhat involved in a project where a roof section
was cut off a 63 23 window.  I looked at the bus and told the guy to let go of
it (emotionally), I knew it's hard, he'd had it a long time, but it was so far
gone, it just wasn't going to get back on the road - the sunroof had been left
open for ten years and that's a bad idea.   The roof went onto a 59
walkthrough non sunroof deluxe.   The 59 had been driven by a hippy dude when
someone ran a red light across he path and the bus mushed into the red light
running car.    Hippy dude sold me the bus w/o motor.  I passed it on, and the
59 got a nose transplant from a 61 standard that was rusted badly (walk
through floors), and the sunroof section from the 63, and the subfloors were
added.

three buses (nose donor, 59, and roof donor) went into one bus.      All three
were dead.  The 59 didn't *need* to get a roof transplant, but there was a guy
who really wanted a  walkthrough 23 window.   Really wanted it.   really
realyy, it seems.   Theoretically it's around, but I haven't seen it driven.
Who knows, maybe he'll leave the sunroof open on it for ten years.

so, for whatever reason, the idea I get of buses that donate 21/23 window roof
section look like that 63 where the bottom rusted out,  or like a 65 I've seen
that donated it's roof, it was badly badly hit.   And for some reason, people
like buses with big holes in the roof, and some are willing to invest
time/money/energy into doing a transplant.   If they do it, they should
realise it is a big big effort, and subfloors are neccessary for structural
stability.

I don't think anyone was encouraging junking a good bus.  (If they were, I
missed it).   I don't think anyone was saying hack up into pieces a good bus
(I've cut pieces off junkyard buses, but am concerned when I hear about people
cutting donor pieces, and have been known to ask - are you sure the donor
wasn't savable?)

Aren't you maybe a little touchy as people are dogging lowered buses?  You
guys should just accept that some people don't agree with you about lowering.
