Subject: 6v fuel sender

Though this question is for a T3, I'm sure the answer would be the same
for a bus fuel tank sender also.

I'm cleaning a very gunked up/rusty fuel tank that has sat for 20+
years.  I assume the sender is gunked up inside as well as outside.  Can
you take them apart to clean them?  I've cleaned the out side, but not
dissembled it yet.  Can you?  

Steve
