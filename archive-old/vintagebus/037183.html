&lt;&lt; Hello everyone. This may seem like a lunkheaded question, but, what is the 
 preferred mirror on a splitty bus, elephant ear style or round? I see enough 
 of both and I can't figure out which one. What does everyone on this list 
 have or prefer? It is also my understanding that the elephant ear style was 
 an option, right? I have the round mirrors myself but have been pondering 
the 
 other style...hmmmm...just curious what everyone else thinks. Thanks 
everyone 
 and take care.

I have one on each side of mine bus, elephant on the left, little round on 
the right. I used to have two elephant, but the pass side one went funky, and 
got replaced.  these were both available at the same time from VW, also there 
were other styles available.  Some buses never came w/ mirrors.  Mirrors I 
think were an option, whether you had elephants, round, the ones that are 
sort of rectangular and go on the D arms, the huge ugly truck mirrors or 
whatever.  You could go down to VW and buy waht you want and get them to 
remove that top hinge pin and install the mirror arm and mirror.    It sort 
of boils down to which you like best.  Now the little round ones are  
available inexpensively as repros, they are more available, like the elephant 
ears which are being made as well, so these are what you can go get easily.  
IMOPBO, The round ones are cuter, but the elephant ears have more 
mirror/visibility.
