Subject: What the heck? (pushrod/rocker arm)

Started the bus this morning for it's warm-up and it backfired but started.  
Thought it was odd.  When I started driving, no power, vibrating above 2k 
rpms, got to my destination, went to work, when I got back started poking 
around, found a wet #3 plug, wires looked good, pulled the valve cover and 
voila, looking at the end of a pushrod.  It was the inboard rocker on #3.  
Which is that, intake or exhaust?

Anyway, pulled the rockers, reset the pushrod, pulled out the feeler gauges, 
and it was a little tight, but still had some play before readjustment.  
Adjuster screws a little pitted and worn, pushrod still straight as a pin, 
head was clean.  Mexican block, 1600dp.  Drove home, no problems.  What 
gives?  Cant figure out why it let loose.
