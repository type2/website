Subject: Westy Hitch

--part1_31.28c9ffb0.2a455ef2_boundary


Like everyone else I am looking for a Westy style hitch for my '65 Double 
Cab.  I was told 2 sold at the OCTO this year but I never saw them.  I would 
be willing to purchase one regardless of condition and I am trying to get 
started reproducing them but I need a pattern.  Any one who has one I can 
buy, borrow or well, borrow please let me know.  
Thanks everyone,
Arthur 760.365.1671.
