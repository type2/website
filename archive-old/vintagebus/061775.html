Subject: Re: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?

Not a VB type of guy anymore...

Doglegs = the piece behind the front wheel?  If so, I might know where 
there might be a decent pair. '59 IIRC. Is that &quot;early&quot;?

&gt; JP and I were talking about this at the RT66 splits meeting last night.
&gt; The trouble is that early doglegs seem to be very hard to find.  Greg
&gt; Noble I believe had a set a while back I missed out on by not jumping
&gt; right in.  I've been keeping my eyes open for a passenger side one for
&gt; several years and haven't found one even though I don't scour the Samba
&gt; ads every day and I don't get around the bus circles that much.
&gt; Seems like doglegs are one of the first things to rust out.  Someday I
&gt; might consider repro, but we would all rather have OG.
&gt; I'm glad it's Jon's delimma and not mine.:)
