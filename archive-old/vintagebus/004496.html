I assumed the adapter installed as a &quot;sandwich&quot; between the oil cooler and
crankcase.  But I hadn't seen or heard of such an adapter having the filter
base integrated.  Seems like a poorly engineered and very awkward design to
me.

The longest-lived 1600SP I've ever had in a Type 2 [143,000 miles and still
very strong when sold] ran a remote filter and an external cooler in lieu of
the stock oil cooler.  The filter assembly was mounted to the engine room
overhead to the left of the hatch and plumbed to the adapter and cooler with
custom hose assemblies from a commercial hydraulics shop.

Thanks for your reply...

&gt;&gt;  that filter adaptor mounts under your oil cooler inside your fan shroud,
the arm for the filter is at a fixed angle and you have to cut the shroud to
screw on the filter.  Its all one piece so you've got no choice as to
mounting.  Thats three problems from my perspective, 1 only filter hot oil,
2 some blocking or altering of the air flow, 3 you've got to cut the tin,
not to mention the hell of a mess you've got changing a horizontal filter.
