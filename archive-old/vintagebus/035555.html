&lt;&lt; Are oil sending units always leaky?  It seems no matter where I buy them, 
they
 always leak (a lot, like drip.. [15 sec to 3 min].. drip... etc.)between the
 metal case and the plastic insides, or around the terminal.  I just want to
 know if this is a normal thing.  Thanks.
  &gt;&gt;
no they shouldn't do this.  Yes they do sometimes, and no sir I don't like 
it.  it should not drip.  If they do I condsider them bad and replace it.   
Bad cruddy manufacturing?
