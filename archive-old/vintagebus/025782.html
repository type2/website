Well I know this is not a question to the list but I just wanted to say
I feel great. I removed my first bus engine today and I had no help. I
was very worried about dropping it or something. I made sure I followed
all the steps in the manual and I used the engine cart (which is a great
item to buy) disconnected and labeled the wiring, disconnected the
power, disconnected the fuel line, made sure the heating cables weren't
hooked up and pulled the engine out alittle, made sure everything
cleared and lowered her down on the cart. That was it. While the my 65
bus gets some much needed body work some day. I will work on the engine.

Well thats it...it was very cool experience.
Bryan
