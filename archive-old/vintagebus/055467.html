Subject: Re: [VB] Aridzona VW Show--

&gt; Chirco is on the far east side of Tucson, Arizona, at 9101 E. 22'nd
&gt; St..  We in Tucson like to think that we are very remote from our big
&gt; brother to the north!

Nice little show in the lot around Chirco's. My alltime favorite swaps for
the &quot;score&quot; type of purchase. Every year I've found something that made the
trip worthwhile, even if I didn't plan on buying. Don't much look at the
bugs and Ghia's and sandrails, they are too shiny. Always 8 or 10 buses
though. Gotta go to Buses and Balloons this year though, so you can have
what I was going to buy.
