Subject: Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

History: New rebuilt 1600 SP engine.

After 20-minute run in and then a short 5-mile drive, I waited until today
to readjust the valves cold. All were loose except one. They were set at
.006 before run in and short drive. Today were .009 to .013. The one
exception was .004. I figured the opposite would be found today. All were
set back to .006.

Anyhow, I took her on a road trip to continue the break-in today. Nice
conditions with hilly roads some stop lights. Many different rpms and
speeds, up and down moderate hills (except Boyd Smith's driveway- a mountain
goat would get winded). After about 20-25 miles, I pulled into my dad's
driveway and at idle, the oil light started to flicker. It would go away
when revved a bit. The temperature was only about 210 degrees. After the
drive back, this did not occur, but is had cooled outside and the
temperature only went up to about 180. Any ideas about that?
This may seem very paranoid (build an engine for the first time and I dare
you to not be that way), but the bus *seemed* to use more gas looking/
watching the gauge. I wonder if some gas is getting into the oil to make it
thinner. How can I tell? After the 20 min. run in, I changed the oil and it
*seemed* thin (very unscientific I know but I have changed the oil when warm
before).

I also appear to have an engine vibration at a certain RPM. I am
disappointed with that as I had the whole thing balanced at the machine
shop. I have no tach installed so can not tell exactly what engine speed
this occurs. Occurs at about 28mph in third gear and about 40 mph in fourth.
I guess I will have to live with that.

TIA for any input!
