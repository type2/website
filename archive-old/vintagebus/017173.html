The guy who makes the repro wiring harnesses sells repro cigarette
lighters.  He took an aftermarket lighter and adapted a VW knob to it.
They look pretty slick.  He gets soemthing like $20 or so for them.

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html - go to the &quot;wiring harness&quot;
section.

&gt; Not that I plan to take up smoking, but it would be nice to have the lighter
&gt; socket as a power point.
