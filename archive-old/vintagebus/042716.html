Hi isaiah,

You can rebuild the motor you have.  Its not that hard (heck i've done it
so it couldnt be rocket science, hehe)

Just get muir, bently, and tom wilsons book and go to it...

parts i'd say you will need:
main bearings:
rod bearings:
rebuilt rods (make sure the small end bushings are replaced not peened)
reground cam/lifters
pistons and cylinders
get a dial indicator and chgeck your valve guides for wear. Replace any
that are worn and put in 4 new exhaust valves, lap to seats.
new oil pump.

Inspect crank for wear... if needed regrind or find another. (if you dont
know how to inspect it have it done for you)

and of course any machine work that needs to be done (case savers,
possible line bore if and only if needed)

what better way to learn engine building than by doing.  Dont go overboard
your first time, build to stock or close to stock specs... VW balances
components individually so one may simply bolt together units.  Its not as
good as a full balance job, but this is a learning experience, build the
killer balanced motor next time. I'd say with proper measuring of the
components you have to determine what is worn and what isnt, you can get
by for a few hundred, about what a used motor might cost in decent shape.

I guess the main thing is dont go overboard, take it stock and
easy... people will tell you that you have to do all kinds of stuff but if
spending double gets an extra 20% life out of the engine, is it really
worth it?

You are the mechanic in charge, the final decisions are up to you.

take care,

Steve
