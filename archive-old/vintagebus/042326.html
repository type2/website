Subject: [VB] I have a new bus! '67 Westy

Volks, 

There is, in case you are new, a test to see whether you are qualified for
bus ownership :-)  If you have not taken it, I urge you to go to:

http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/vwquiz.html

and have a go at it :-)

Well, by times just to check my sanity level I go back and have another
look. Recently, I took the test, passed it (8 of 10 d's, and found myself
*enjoying* the feel of wet, oily sand in my hair (both of them!).  As a
result, I felt that the time had come so I went and bought me a splittie
:-)  it fits right in with my general rules on auto buying. It was a VW,
it was less than $1000, and it did not run :-) Pictures of the bus can be
seen at: http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus.  Comments are welcome!

On a side note, I find myself amazed at what qualifiies as a &quot;good&quot; bus to
me and how much it varies by generation.  When I was searching for an air
cooled vanagon, I passed *much* better looking examples that this, without
even a second thought.  The '73, which is is in better shape than this and
runs is iffy for the amount of rust present on it. Yet, here I am looking
at a certifiably rocker-free bus as &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;restorable&quot; and view
the presence of the original (tho no doubt frozen solid) H series case
engine and the shredded door panels (make fine patterns!) as major bonuses
:-)

'73 Westy (awaiting new ball joints)
'80 Westy (running fine)
