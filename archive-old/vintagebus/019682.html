Honestly, that's about what I was figuring...

He only asked me to post about what was needed, and how, but I wanted to get another outside
opinion as to what would ACTUALLY occur!  That's why I went into all of that about what he
explicitly wanted this transformation to do for him.  (several are trying to talk him into keeping
the RGB's for the reasons you stated)  He's just looking for something else to do... which is
cool, but, personally, I don't think this should be it.

THANK YOU ALL, for your quick responses. To any others: Keep them coming, if you've got the itch
to tell me something.  I've got open ears!  ...er, eyes and monitor, I mean!!

Thanks, Travis


&gt; Are you kidding?  When you deep 6 the RGBs you raise the gear ratios and
&gt; have less climbing ability.  And with a trailer!  
&gt; 
&gt; Unless this guy is on the open road most of the time, where he can use the
&gt; extra speed and low RPMs, I would leave the RGBs alone.  The stop-and-go
&gt; daily traffic will be harder on the motor w/o RGBs.  Clutches are cheap I
&gt; suppose.
&gt; 
&gt; Put in a C/W crank and let her rev up on the interstate.
