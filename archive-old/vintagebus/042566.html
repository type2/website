well,

Thought i'd throw in my o-pinion and obervations. (of course)

The bus market is finally coming in line with other collector car markets.

When i got into busses a few years ago, useful pretty busses went for
about the same money as &quot;original&quot; and &quot;correct&quot; busses.

Nowadays, the splitty market seems to be a collector market.  original and
correct looking (i say looking because many of the high dollar busses are
anything but correct, but look it to the untrained eye) busses go for a
premium like 10X what one can pick up a useful and pretty bus for, though
it may not be correct, its nice and well put together... though may have a
late model interior, or be painted GM colors. Or be a deluxe hardtop with
none of the deluxe bits, but nice looking. This is the same in any
collector car market.  As cars get older and less likely to be used, the
usefulness becomes secondary to the originality as far as the &quot;on crack&quot;
valuations go.

I'd say the bay market is still (for the most part) useful and pretty is
equal in value to original and correct.... but give it time.

The nice thing is that the whole thing is a bit self limiting.  the higher
prices get, the fewer people can afford it, then the whole thing becomes
unpopular, and all of a sudden you have everyone selling like crazy...

The other thing that could kill the fad is neccecary spares becoming
unobtanium new or used.  Few people will risk to drive a car that once
something wears out its dead, or they have to spend a bazillion dollars to
fix it. (look at what a NOS 36 horse case seems to go for, OUCH! and it
will only get worse. I know store the 36er and run a 1600, but you get my 
point i suppose...)

pretty much any old car that isnt museum quality or a fad, goes for a
reasonable sum. The bus market will get back in line... someday. Till
then i remain a bottom feeder, hehe.  Send me your sick, your mangled,
your rusty beyond recognition.

as always, IMHO, and i hope i didnt offend (i've been good at that lately
it seems...)

take care,

Steve
