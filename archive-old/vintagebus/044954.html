Just got this notice from ebay, I wonder how this will affect all those 
sellers listing stuff as &quot;NOT N.O.S.&quot;???????

Dear frankiehil (frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com),

eBay appreciates the fact that you chose to list your auction:

BLUE SWING BIKE VERY NICE!! N/R NOT SCHWINN 
Item #362625329 

with us.   However, you may not be aware of this but your auction contained 
&quot;Key Word Spamming&quot; which is prohibited on eBay.  Although your auction is 
inconsistent with our listing guidelines, we will allow your current running 
auctions to complete their course and end on their own.

Key word spamming is the practice of adding words, including brand names, 
which are not directly related to the item you are selling or which are 
included for the primary purpose of attracting or diverting bidders to a 
listing which is not permitted.

Key word spamming is not only a manipulation of our search engines, but is 
also unfair to members who may be searching for a specific item and receive 
search engine results of listings which are not selling the item.  Users 
often are confused and frustrated by such tactics.  Certain uses of brand 
names may also constitute trademark infringement and could expose sellers to 
legal liability. 

 Methods of Key Word Spamming include, but are not limited to:

1.  Extra Brand Names in Title or Item Description
2.  Not Brand X, Not Brand Y

Your auction contained the following title:

&quot;BLUE SWING BIKE VERY NICE!! N/R NOT SCHWINN&quot;

3.  Improper Trademark Usage
4.  Lists of &quot;Key&quot; Words
5.  Hidden Text  (White on white text, or hidden text in HTML Code)
6.  Drop Down Boxes

Please view our Listing Policies page for further details on this and other 
guidelines on listing your items:

For more information on why eBay has ended an auction, please visit:

Please understand our goal is to help you understand our policies to ensure 
successful experiences at eBay. Therefore, we respectfully request that you 
refrain from this activity in the future to avoid the possibility of a 
suspension of your eBay registration. 

Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have on 
our existing listing policies.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Regards,
