NOT a good idea.....but if you use a great deal of precaution and promise
not to fall asleep with the thing on after a hard day on the
slopes....it'll work.  Because the combustion is taking place inside the
Bus...the air you need to breathe is being consumed by the fire and the
gases being given off are not healthy either for too long of a period.
Hunters often end up in the news..heating their campers up while they take
the LONG sleep.
