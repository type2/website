&gt;After finance charges and insurance and everything on that new beetle,
you would probably have enough money to fix chicago rust on a bus 10X over,
and install AC to boot...
&gt;
Is there really any point to trying to convince someone to drive their Bus
year round?  Part of having a Bus is not having society's values crammed
down your throat.  Unless I'm mistaken, owing a Bus is not even a pre-requisite
to joining a VW club.

I would agree it's foolish to have a new vehicle, new Beetle or otherwise,
better to have a POS 70s-80s car.  I do.  And someone just rear-ended it.
 Glad it wasn't my Bus.  Guess where the repair money is going...
