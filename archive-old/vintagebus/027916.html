&gt; that works fine, but eventually I'd like to get it to work with the key again. Any suggestions on what could be causing this? I have a new voltage regulator and new wires to the battery. All connections at the starter/solenoid are new and look good. The battery is new too. I'm thinking it's got to be somewhere between the starter/solenoid/relay and the ignition switch. When I turn the ignition to on and short the solenoid connections, it starts fine - so the ignition switch is working....right?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

Try checking the starter bushing.......sounds like a weird place to &quot;start&quot; looking, but past experience has shown me otherwise.
