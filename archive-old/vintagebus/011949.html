Subject: bug-o-flopo whittman,engine report
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

got your attention, vw howard and i (2 of the havasu connection)decided to go to whittman bug-o-rama put on by the sac. bugformance instead of the tuscon southwest bug-in or from what i have heard a fantastic show put on by charlie in HB cal.
chose bugo because of distance and time. should have gone to cal, next year.
anyway the show was ok thats it a couple of splittys in  show, vwhoward won first for under construction with the 58 binz, way to go john
swap was tiny no great finds a 61 bus shell (no
drivtrain or interior at all, had a subframe and tongue , it was a trailer sold for 400 bucko's
it did have all glass, both bumpers, small tails ice picks and glass, and the body was strait original paint 
it would have been a perfect candidate for thom's worse of the worse.
but we still had fun and it was a vw show no more around till BUSES by the BRIDGE III this JANUARY
for there first show out here and 2 others happening the same day they did a good job, thanks

 
the 1776 single port(see previous post) ran flawlessly 22 mpg no pedal to the metal on the hills ran cool and all
but the blower tubes were blocked off at the shroud, it needs a new muffler the blower tube
connectors on the pipes off the heads are missing
so nothing to connect the fresh air blower tubes
to.  any way as people mentioned on the list the blower air does cool the heat exchangers cool!
heat! i put on used heater boxes that i did not clean very well and all the old oil just burn't off, this was 20 years of s#^t that was there
so the people who talked about this on the list were right the fresh air tubes cool the heat exchangers
so i learned a lesson the fresh air tube need to be connected to heater boxes, you should have seen the smoke thought i had a valve cover leaking
but now they look like new not a spot of oil
so if you want to clean the outside of your heater boxes just disconnect the fresh air tubes and drive for a few hundred miles.
 so my next update on my 65 westy will be a RANCHO
3.88 r/p trans, have the power to push it now, watch out cruise at 65+ dangerous or fun,
