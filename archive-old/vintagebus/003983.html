Well, I finally splurged and bought the Robert Bentley Workshop Manual for
the VW Transporter 1963-1967. THIS THING IS HUGE.  I just wanted to let
everyone know about this thing.  If you haven't put out the $80.19 yet (this
was my total cost with 2 day shipping), it's worth it.  Lots of pictures,
and information. It's going to take me a few weeks to read it all (hey, it's
more fun than reading the dictionary). Only thing I wish it would have, is
color wiring diagrams. But it even has cool pictures of the ambulance stuff,
and how to remove it.  Like the Rotary Emergency Light, Ambulance Fans,
Spotlight, Red Cross Light, and Speedometer Reverse Switch. All cool stuff.
