Subject: Re: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

&gt; Congrats!!! I'm a frim believer in the' feel right' bus factor.
 me too, now if only people would stop laughing at my panel.

&gt; &gt; if the stub axles don't wobble, odds are the RGBearings are okay.   when
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; pull the drain pull you shouldn't see oil.   that's just how it is.
the
&gt; &gt; habitrail system works... center section is open to the axles.  the
&gt; puddles in the
&gt; &gt; V and oil when you turn it sounds okay.
 i don't expect to see oil, but usually there is enough to get my finger
 wet(admittedly, i'm usually the one who filled the transaxle too), but it
 didn't seem to be up around that gear at alll, only picking it up as rolled
 through. so it would be normal for it to be at that level, and then fill to
 the top with a turn of the axle?

&gt; &gt; the click when turned may be from the Fplate area at the crown gears and
&gt; axle
&gt; &gt; spades... those wear on buses.   did you hear a thunk when you suddenly
&gt; let
&gt; &gt; off the gas (driving, in gear)... it would indicate bad slop at the fp
&gt; area.
 no thunk that i noticed. but you do mostly hear the noise coasting, think
it
 may just be that engine noise covers it when giving it gas.  i tow roped
the
 bus as it wasn't running, and with the engine off you could hear the noise
 like a tire rub the whole while. but at tow rope speeds it was less
 constant. like an out of true bike wheel only rubbing when it hits that
 spot. at that point i thought it was the tire b/c they were all near flat
 and have weak side walls anyway.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; maybe I'm miserly, but when I redid my big nut RGBs in the 61 a few
years
&gt; &gt; ago... I just replaced what was bad.
 miserly eh? my wife just calls me a cheap bastard.

&gt; &gt; you could also jack up a rear wheel, place on jack stands, block front
&gt; &gt; wheels,  turn engine on and bus in gear... walk back and listen for
&gt; noises... unless
&gt; &gt; you have a limited slip dif this is fine with one wheel off the ground,
or
&gt; &gt; you can do both at once.
&gt; &gt;
 i ran it up on stands, the engine is loud enough to cover the noise with
bus
 idling in gear
