Well volks, the '62 is getting a 1600 DP with a Solex 34.

It's a long story that you've heard before, but 
now I understand why I couldn't set my valves to
.006...  And why there was no compression in #3.


Now, my question is this:  I can't find any distributors
locally other than 009.  I'm dreading 009/34 flatspot
syndrome and I'd like a reconditioned vacuum dizzy.  
Doesn't seem like it should be a tall order.  

If I'm lucky, and don't have the flatspot, the 009 will
be hunky dory, but I sure don't feel very lucky after 
buying a 1600 longblock...
