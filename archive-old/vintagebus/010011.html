Subject: [VB] alabama insurance update

Of course this message is mainly for the entertainment of you people that
live in the real world. I went down to get insurance tuesday, and there was
a line around the block. i had to wait 3 hours to get in and i was early.
People brought thier lawn chairs, it was crazy, and hot.  For a second i had
a flashback to standing in line for dead tickets, but that went away as soon
as i heard someone make a joke about an old volkswagen. Man it was a real
slice of life, try to imagine for a second the people in alabama that never
had insurance, i wont go into that.  So i told the agent that i should get a
discount because i cant go over 55mph, and he said speed doesnt matter if a
wheel falls off. I almost slapped him for that, and i assured him that if
nothing else the mechanicals of my vw are very safe.  Well they had never
heard of a transporter, so once again i was humiliated by having my bus
insured as a 1966 vanagon, that hurts. So i paid my $150 for the next 6
months, and i cant wait till i get pulled over, which certainly is
inevitable. On the way home a guy in a delivery truck pulled up next to me
and asked what year my &quot;van&quot; was, i told him, and he got that wierd look
that everybody gets that asks that. You know the look, its the look that
says &quot; i love that old bus, i cant figure out why but i do&quot; or &quot;i would
drive that, i cant figure out why but i would&quot;.  Anyway he said &quot;66! Its so
quiet i cant even hear it running!!&quot;, he so was excited.  Anyway, now that
we are all insured here, you guys are welcome to come down to alabama, you
dont have to be scared anymore. jb
