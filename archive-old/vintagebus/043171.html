If your trim is already smooth but not shiny, just rub on some Mothers
brand polish, you can get it in many FLAPS.  It'll bring on a high shine.
If you really want to preserve the shine, you have to apply POR-15's
Crystal Top Coat, following their instructions to the T. You will need to
spray that on, preferably in a paint booth, hanging the parts
