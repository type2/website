Subject: Cab Door Hinge repair for sagging doors.

Hi,

I noticed that the upper cab door hinges are well worn on my
bus causing a sag. After some thought and measurement,
I figured that the best way to repair them would be to drill
out the moving side of the hinge (the worn part)
to 11/32, to clean out the hole. Then make a press fit pin
on the lathe with a 1/8&quot;
diameter through hole. Press in the pin, use loctite as
needed. Set the hinge plate up on the mill, use the 1/8&quot;
through
hole to line up. Drill and ream the press in pin to .3125.
Now it will fit nicely onto the .308-.310 mirror post.
I noticed however that the aftermarket mirror posts are only
about .300-.305 in diameter, a loose fit in both the
part riveted to the door as well as the other side.

Thats all for now.

Chris
