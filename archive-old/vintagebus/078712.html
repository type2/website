Subject: Re: [VB] Long trip report

I'm more into driving my top heavy breadbox. Just to appreciate this marvel
of a low cost production vehicle that is still low cost to maintain and
operate.

&gt; &gt; The bus scene seems to be more about restoring cars and
&gt; &gt; making them shiny, rather than camping and intrepid explorations

&gt; or was as  I skilfully re-create the patina. The sand blasted front
bumper,
&gt; Or as Jay Leno says, restore it to 100 points.. drive it and take it back
&gt; down to 50 points..... and start the process all over again.
