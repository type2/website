Subject: heat duct thingys

So ... what have people been using to connect the heater things to the bus
body.  My bus is a 60 so ... I've looked at the beetle plastic accordion
things but they are too long.  I need ones about 7&quot;.  I've been using those
foil things that stretch - they work - but I'd bet that if I could get the
beetle ones to work they would be quieter and warmer.  Ideas?
