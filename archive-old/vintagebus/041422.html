&gt; I'm concerned about the dual valve spring situation.  Had I known that I

&gt; I have a stock reground 110) with the dual springs.  

You broke them in with stock heads right?  You did good.  The 20 minute 
break-in is the most critical thing.  Hopefully things got properly
hardened and will work well.  I sure wouldn't want to have you cancel your
trip because of it.  Maybe you need a road trip after all this engine
stuff.:)

&gt; Has anyone actually managed to run dual springs and pulled it off without
&gt; flattening a cam?  Dammit - after all I went through these past few days to
&gt; try to make it and then this.  Makes you appreciate stock stuff more and
&gt; more...
My problem was I tried to do the cam run-in with dual springs.  Cams and
lifters seem to give a fair amount of troubles now days.  I've heard of
stock cams running flat too.  I think this is why Berg now offers the cam
and lifters pre-broken-in as a set.  I have the feeling they got quite a
few complaints from people running in their dual-spring engines, but
that's only my opinion, not based on fact.  To their credit they did work
out a solution to breaking in cams instead of just hoping it will go away.
You can rest well knowing you did the run-in on single springs at least.
