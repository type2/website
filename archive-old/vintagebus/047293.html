Hi Thom,
The problem is that from what this fellow and others we have met is that they 
can not get any of the cable or it's outer flex sleeve out of the tube in the 
body.  Most of the time spent is waiting while the chemical (Oil or acid) 
works which you can use painting those flowers on or doing tons of other 
things while the chemical does it's work.  Eric&amp;Barb
