&gt; last night and i found that my #4 exhaust valve had
&gt; snapped mangling my other valve, destroying my piston
&gt; and sending bits of stuff all through my engine, not a
&gt; pretty site('74 1800 engine).  i am really bummed
&gt; seeing this was a replacement AVP head with less than
&gt; 7000 miles on it.

Does anybody have an email address for AVP? (Not Boston Engine, Bus Depot or
Aircooled.Net which are resellers.) The archives don't produce one readily.
AVP has gotten a great deal of very good press on these lists over the years
and I'm sure they'd love to have an opportunity to resolve a (quite rare)
complaint.

And if not, I'm sure several of us can be counted upon to intercede.
