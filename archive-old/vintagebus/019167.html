---------------
I have a galvanized metal tube (piping) 3/4 roof rack
on my 1963 EZ camper. It has a blue metalic sticker on
the rear horizontal tube with a ZVW part number plus
additional description. Haven't had the time to go out
and look at the rack lately. Will report back, if
necessary, this weekend.
