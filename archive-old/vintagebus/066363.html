  The units they manufacture are numerous magnets 8 to be exact on a metal
plate in a curved holder the shape of the filter. The magnets wrap a little
less then 1/2 way around the filter. The backside metal is NOT magnetic,
this they say was accomplished by layering the metal the magnets are
attached to. Another problem they said with magnets is that heat can affect
them?. The only VW related test he told me about were on Type 4 powered off
road race cars.
  This filter magnet is so strong that I CANNOT pull it straight off the
filter, it has to be slide off the end. Another funny note was that the demo
filter was a cheapo Fram and mine are Premium MANN. I did learn that the
thickness and quality of the metal has something to do with magnets
sticking. I could pull the magnet off of the Fram can.
  They also say put the magnet up as close to the lip of the filter as
possible, this way in bypass mode it will also trap particles. The main
thing they are after to trap is the metal off the cylinder walls, not
bearing material or case. If you have that in your oil it's to late anyway.

ronnie  for free it's worth a try, for the 49.95 retail, well I don't know

here's a link to their web site

The use of magnets to immobilize ferrous wear particles is very real,
however the magnets that are sold for these purposes are typically rather
--------------------------- Clip --------------------------
First I have to admit that I am a klutz.
Every time I change my oil I burn my fingers and drop the drain plug in
the tub of hot oil.
When I installed my first Type IV Air Cooled engine I kept dropping the
plug, same goes for my most recent engine, I'm still a klutz.
I use a magnet on a extension handle similar to a radio antenna to get
the plug out of the hot oil.
I noticed that I was getting minute metal particles on the retrieving
magnet.
Just for a hoot I tore up a Winchester Hard drive and removed the
magnets, these are very strong magnets riveted to a steel plate and fit
the Type IV strainer plate surface to a T. They are so strong that they
adhere through extreme rainwater splashes and 65/75 mph speeds without
moving a fraction on the strainer plate.
From then on I never got any minute iron particles from my engine oil,
roughly 140K on the first engine I used them on. It could have gone
longer but I rebuilt it and started the magnet routine on the new engine.
Same scenario, it caught the iron particles in the strainer plate. To
judge the volume on a new engine I've got to say the particles leveled
the strainer plate top side for the first 8000 miles. It is substantially
lesser amounts as the engine has seated the cylinders and other steel
parts.
Its cheap insurance even if it just makes you feel better.
