~i think i understand that i should be able to replace the dual ports with my
single ports...i will just need to replace a couple studs...which i can
perhaps take off my original block.

&quot;You can have alot reground, but not pistons. Do you mean to have the
cylinders honed? &quot;

~i meant the valves and where they sit in the head...supposed to be at a 45
degree? so that the valve in the head sits properly...my local mechanic is
more than halfway through with this...he has also installed new guides.

as for carburetion...I have a '65 bus, no manual choke lever up front, if i
went with a manual choke i guess i would have to run a line up to the front
seat? i don't think i want to do that...nor am i sure how complicated this
would be...

i am checking with rmmw re: their carbs, it says on their site that you can
put a 31 pict3 on the 1600, but you need to replace the idle valve and choke
element...i am not sure if they sell the parts i would need to replace but am
checking on it now.
