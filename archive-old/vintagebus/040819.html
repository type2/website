Bugs were always 'cute' vehicles.  People didn't
but them for utilitarian purposes, that's what
busses were for.  Hauling people, stuff, camping,
off hiway, etc. that's a bus life.

Admittedly some people bought busses for their
visual appeal, they are different from all other
vehicles, but in the early years, utilitarian 
uses were the norm.

Along comes the NB, NM, and whatever.

The same thing applies to the NB, people buy them
cause they are cute.  The New Microbus?  It's cute,
but appears to offer little in utilitarian function.
Are the seats removable, can I get a full sheet of
plywood in there?  Can I do all that and go camping?
That thing is way too small.

I hope that VW sees this as a cute vehicle, and is
still pursuing a T2v5 bus. 1=split, 2=loaf, 3=Vanagon,
4=Eurovan, 5=New Bus.  

I wanna utilitarian vehicle, haul people, cargo, camping.
Until VW does it, I will have to stick to my '64 Ford
Crewcab.  BTW, I can still go to a shop and get work
done on it with confidence they can find parts and have
the knowledge to work on it.  Not quite the same with
VW's anymore unfortunately.  They are passing further 
and further into the specialty hobbyist category, rather
that a functional vehicle.  Shame.
