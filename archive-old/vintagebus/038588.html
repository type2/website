Greetings to y'all (southern lingo),
I have good news to share. Clyde (my bus, named after the slow ghost in Pac
Man) is up and running again. I got the new DP mexi motor in and running on
only the second attempt.

The first attempt was stifled by a stripped shaft on one of the carbs + a 6v
starter, 6v tranny and 12v flywheel. This doesn't work. First off, I had a
set of new 34 webers , but i must have stripped the shaft on the right one
(over 1 and 2) while assembling them :(. This gave way too much play in the
linkage. So my mechanic had a stock 34 carb sitting around and I got an
intake manifold from a local VW friend. I'm kind of glad I went with this
route. More reliable, less crap to deal with :). So we went with one carb
and I traded the others to my mechanic for the stock one plus a half day's
labor. Then we got the motor in and started it up and realized that the
starter wasn't even connecting with the flywheel. We then assessed the
situation and looked at the old, eaten up flywheel on the old motor and
deducted that it was a 6v starter with a 12v flywheel. That is probably why
my old flywheel was eaten up. So he brought in a rebuilt starter he had
lying around today and we stuck that in there. We decided to pull the engine
out again and replace the tranny mounts aswell. We were working on an
incline, so it was pretty hard to get the motor in the first time. Plus,
there were these little flaps on top of the heat exchangers getting in the
way. The second time was easier and we even got the motor to squeeze into
the seals right.
We finally started her up at about 7:30 this evening and figured out that
they don't adjust the valves at the factory on these new mexi motors. So, we
then did that and got it running! We then let it run with crappy oil in it
for about 20 minutes to start the break-in process. It ran beautifully.
Except, there was an irregular, low hum at idle. Not very loud. You had to
really listen for it. There seemed to be no pattern. Just every once and a
while. Could this just be because the engine is seating? Or should I inspect
it further? 

All we have to do now is finish replacing the brake lines, bleed brakes,
replace front shocks, change oil and tranny fluid and weld up safari window
monting brackets! Then it'll be road worthy! This will actually be the first
time that I've driven my bus without any any problems to fix. I can't wait
to hop on the Interstate and watch people pass me left and right! I'm so
excited. There's just something about being the slowest vehicle on the road.
I have been thinking about attending BNNTA, but I need more details. I know
this has probably already been discussed, but I must have missed it. Is
there a webpage?

I think, in a couple of months I'm going to POR-15 the heat exchangers and
headers. What do you guys think? Good idea? I am just getting started on
removing the undercoating of the bus. So far, I have the passenger wheel
well totally clean and ready to be painted. My roommate is using POR-15 on
the front floor of his F*rd panel van, so we have kind of a POR-support
group going on. Any suggestions would be more than welcome. Basically, I
just want a solid, tough-as-nails bus. This takes importance over being
stock, correct, or cool-looking. Thanks for allowing me a large chunk of
your time. I hope this is encouraging.
