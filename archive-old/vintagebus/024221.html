You need the 12V bushing, unless you get an automatic starter, which
doesn't use the support bushing and will fit any bell housing.  It's
just a tad longer overall, but not a problem.  I have used one since
about 1975 for my bus.  The bushing can be a pain to get in unless you
have the engine pulled.

 Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in the process of converting my 62 SC from 6 to 12 volts....its been a few
&gt; years since ive done this.....I can't seem to remember for sure, but isn't a
&gt; adapter bushing needed to use the 6 volt starter? By the way, I'm using the
&gt; stock tranny, with a 69 1600 engine (12v flywheel).....and the bellhousing has
&gt; been clearanced to fit..Thanks in advance....
