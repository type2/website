I finally got em'. Shortly after finally finding out why my window
latches didn't line up, here I am fondling my very own set of window
frames and latches. They are totally cool! Thanks to Robert Davis for
giving me a good deal (and to my wife for letting me get them). The
latch attaches to the window in a horizontal fashion and the part that
attaches to the body has a slightly longer pattern. The third single
screw is out further. The knobs on the latches are &quot;BIG&quot; and black and
there is a long thin arm that swings out. I have a feeling that this is
why they were discontinued. I can see this being a weak point. I will
need to be careful with these. Anyway thanks Robert, I am going to go
fondle my frames and latches now.
See ya,
