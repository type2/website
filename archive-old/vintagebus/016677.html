hello everyone,
this is the mega message of a lifetime. first of all,
i was wondering ifanybody has ever assembled one of
those brand new mexi motors. what i mean is, you have
the new block and you put all the new stuff on it. is
there an order that you should follow for assembly or
should i just use the frustrating &quot;guess work&quot;
approach. it's a 1600 dp with dual weber 034 carbs.
(also, on a side note, i have been working on the carb
linkage and i think i have pretty much figured
everything out, but the instructions just seem to
assume that you know what all the pieces are. so if
someone knows of some instructions in &quot;English&quot; or
would be nice enough to help me figure it out, please
pmail me. i have been trying to find that weber carb
book, but to no avail.)

ok, on to issue #2. right now, as you read this (in
all reality probably not, but i can dream), there is a
guy working on the body of my bus. i was thinking
about having him paint it but he mentioned the words
&quot;laquer&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; so i decided to call around. it
looks like i'm going to have to get her painted after
my trip to cornerstone at the end of the month. this
means that i have to put all the new window seals in
and, after c-stone,  take them out again flawlessly so
it can hit the booth. now, mind you, i'm not looking
for answers like &quot;skip your trip&quot; or &quot;don't take your
bus, take your gti&quot; i've heard them and i'm stubborn.
so does anyone know a good method for removing seals
and windows without ruining either? 

ok, last thing. for you OCTO/Classic people. did any
of you see/take pictures of any Dormobiles? i saw a
picture of one from one of last years shows that was
european and i would like to see some close up
pictures  of them. so far all i have ever seen for
euro dormobiles have been mine and this other one.
they seem to have green/white striped canvas instead
of red/white. plus the top opens the other way. thank
you everybody for your time and your generous help.
