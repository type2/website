Subject: Re:Type 2 Gift Exchange, donating a gas heater...

Okay... I've been meaning to do this for a while, and the time seems
right to do it. I have a Stewart-Warner Southwind 6V gas heater that I
rescued from a '64 donor bus with terminal rot. 
	It had been disabled because the exhaust pipe rusted through, letting
copious fumes into the engine bay.
	I have never had it running, although with careful work i feel it
could. As it stands now I feel that it is a 'parts heater'... So I'd
recommend it for whoever already has one and might see the future need
for a source of parts.
	It being 6V, I felt it necessary to put this only on the vintagebus
list. 
	So... Whoever needs it/wants it, e-mail me and I'll send it to you as
soon as I can. 

:)
