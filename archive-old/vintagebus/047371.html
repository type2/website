Subject: What do you know about Solvang?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have heard, or thought I have heard that they have changed the location of 
Solvang. Does anyone know what Buell Arena in Buellton is like? I have never 
been to Solvang before, but have seen video and photos, is it still set in a 
large field? And does anyone know of a planned group campout? I mean, will it 
still have the same feeling of a European vintage show, if its a modern 
stadium?
