My '60 Kombi is almost done getting restored, and considering
everything that's gone into it, I'm going to want to get some
collision insurance on it.  That pretty much means getting an
appraisal.  Anybody know of someone who's cognizant of the VW market
in Colorado, preferably the north-of-Denver, east-of-the-mountains
part?

Yes, I'll be posting pictures, if the paint shop ever lets go of
it....

Thanks.
