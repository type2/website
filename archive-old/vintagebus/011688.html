Well I was driving around Palo Alto, CA today and i saw an old beat up 72
bus sitting in a store parking lot. I stopped and pulled over to look at
it and there was a note saying it would be towed in 3 days. By all the
spider webs on it, it has been there for a while. I went around to the
back and the sticker on the plate  was 91. I went inside the van and
opened the glove box. It had registrations up to 86 with the POs address.
I tried to call him but he is not listed. Question...go back and take the
Van or let some impound lot company tow it away....Its not in too bad of
shape and I have ways of getting a reg without the title....What do ya
think?

Greg
