Subject: Fw: [VB] Perhaps a dumb questuon

Clara
You must have read my mind. I asked my Bud if he would let me &quot;pull them&quot;
at his shop under his supervision.I will still pay him the $200. Kinda like
tution.
I am going to pull them  on a friday deliver the transaxle to the rebuilder
Sat, give him a week,
then put them back in Monday morning.. My rebuilder made the old tranny a
&quot;freeway flyer&quot;
he thinks it only needs the dawgs (South Georgian term) replaced in fourth
gear.(That means nothing to me )
I will certainly use your check list!!! The brakes are mostly new, lines,
wheel cyl's ,shoes
several of the drums.I will check/replace the lines that are worn or weren't
replaced last year.
I did a POR gas tank kit when the trans was out awhile back. Since the bus
will be stored in my buddy's
shop I can pittle with the other items maybe pick his brain some too!
Thanks for your input!!

  Depends on whether how much maintenance you plan on being able to do.
Pulling a motor out of a splitty is very easy.  Tranny pulling isn't tricky
either, but more work.   $200 for a tranny swap sounds really reasonable to me
though.   personally my advice is to do it yourself.   If you can swing a deal
with the guy to 'tutor' you guys through it... that'd be ideal.

  If you soak the engine compartment, under the engine, and around the tranny
and the RGBs with simple green, let it soak in a while, then drive it to the
pressure washer and give it a good wash, it'll make tranny swapping much
pleasanter.   watch out for paper hoses with the pressure washer, and don't
hit the distributor either. water in the distributor cap makes it not run (dry
out w/ clean dry rag if needed)

  Also, while the engine is out, I'd check a bunch of maintenance things, such
as...

  engine to body seal
  new fuel line
  fuel sock in tank
  axle boots &amp; new gear oil
  new rear brake hoses &amp; any new brake parts needed (they'll have to come off
when changing the axles anyway)
  how old are the main &amp; oil cooler seals?
  engine compartment wiring in good shape?
  new tranny mounts

  grommets on engine for metal fuel line/accelerator cable tube.  grommets for
wiring on bus?
  pull shift linkage and replace shift bushings. (tranny MUST be out for
this)

  tube around accelerator cable over tranny so the cable doesn't cut the
tranny?   you can use old fuel line..

  My record for from driving the bus (bumper on) to tranny out and bare of
axles is I think 3 1/2 hours (by myself, not rushing, but no problems) but
that doesn't include any other things like fuel line swap. etc.  So knowing
that you're learning, and there may be snags, and the bus will need more than
the straight swap (like the list above) plan at LEAST a weekend.  If you feel
like cleaning &amp; painting the axle tubes... maybe plan two weekends so you
don't feel rushed.  especially with doing all the other stuff that is easier
or only possible with the tranny&amp; engine out.

  Do read the Muir book... it 'll work for pulling the engine and tranny.   If
you don't have one, buy one.

   For pulling the axles, read the Bentley book.   you can use a regular 17mm
wrench for the engine nuts/bolts.   Tools fro the pulling the motor... nothing
special needed... you do want a rolling floor jack.  For pulling the tranny
you want a 27mm socket and you need a 46mm for the rear drums (or the whacker
tool).  The RGB bolts are 17mm or 19mm...( i've seen both sizes)  I'd get a
1/2&quot; drive 19mm socket... useful also for lug nuts with a breaker bar.  You
also want a 17mm allen for the tranny drain/fill plugs.

  I take the drums and brakes and outer RGB covers off when the tranny is
still in the bus (break the 27mm and RBG bolts loose before lifting the rear
of the bus off the ground)

  If you are replacing the inner RGBearings, you need the 42?mm for the inner
hidden nut under the plug, and the plug issue is tricky.

  Someone mentioned to me that I must have confidence in my bus to drive out
in the boonies a nearly 1000 mile trip... but I have replaced all these worn
parts... so while my bus is 43 years old as of 4 days ago, the running gear is
all in good shape.   And all the little stuff will take some extra time... but
makes the bus better and more reliable/safer.  and I am sure wouldn't be
included in the $200.  Then agian... the first time I pulled a motor, a friend
who had done it before was there... which made it much easier... otherwise I
would have been really confused.

    My son's 66 bus is popping out of 4th gear. My local VW mech. said to
take
    it to the gentleman who rebuild it
    awhile back.(This is not a warrenty issue) We are friends, but he laughed
at
    me when I asked him if he would pull the engine and trans and reinstall
them
    later after the trans is repaired. &quot;It is so simple why don't you and
your
    son do it?&quot;.He even showed me what to do on a dune buggy, we were leaning
on
    while &quot;discussing&quot; this issue. I have average mech. skills (my son zero)
Is
    it really that simple??Do we need to get a book and do it ourselves? I
have
    a set of tools metric and SAE but nothing fancy. I often see chatter
about
    some special 17mm wrench, trouble with seals,etc,etc. My buddy finally
said
    if I insisted he would pull both, store the bus and reinstall both for
$200,
    since this shop is his livehood, it sounded resonable to me.
    Advise more than welcomed
