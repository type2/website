&gt;&gt; Hi Tim,
&gt;&gt;Here is a list of emergancy parts and some of the tools to carry.
&gt;&gt;1. Road flares and reflectors.

(major snippage)

&gt;&gt;73. All tools needed for repairs.  Will list later.   Eric &amp; Barb
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Are you kidding me? Where you going and how long you going, your gonna need
&gt;Bob's limo for all that stuff if you wanna be comfortable. What about a
press
&gt;and brake lathe?
&gt;                      Mike

If I were traveling with Barb &amp; Eric, I wouldn't have to dip into my own
inventory much, which sounds like the smooth way to travel. This is my
version of essentials, assembled after my own roadside adventures. It fits
easily and still leaves room for your bongo drums and other important items.

The parts in a 500 round ammo can in my bus:

1   One complete distributor-009, points set, new cap and rotor
2   2 wheel seal kits
3   Mechanical fuel pump
4   Sparkplugs
5   Front wheel bearings
6   Redux box bearings-lower only
7   exhaust gaskets &amp; muffler kit
8   Every left over gasket from every rebuild kit I ever bought
9   Tranny plug (long story)
10 2 long plug wires (can be cut to fit)
11 Tons of assorted nuts, bolts, washers, little bits of hose and
      steel tubing, odd looking little parts, and assorted hose clamps
12  valve cover gaskets- fit perfect, keep them on top above the
      dizzy and fuel pump

Tools in a little lockable 6 drawer Craftsman add-on chest

1  Screwdrivers-Phillips and flats, stubbies, right angles, small,
    medium, and large, and 7 and 10mm nutdrivers
2  Axle nut tool (hammer kind), jewelers file and flat file, impact
    screwdriver kit, linoleum knife and blades, cold chisel, zip ties,
    electrical tape, teflon tape, assorted sealants, feeler gauges
3  Assorted pliers- wire crimping tool, small and large Vise grips,
    Channellocks, wire dikes, lineman pliers, 8&quot; Crescent, and needlenose
4  Electrical connector kit (assortment), light bulbs (dash, tail, and
    parking), fuses (for VW and others), shrink tubing, butane soldering
    iron (Radio Shack), solder, and flux
5  Assorted wrenches including 2 each of 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and
    19mm, plus a couple of wierd ones I've made up for one thing and another
6  Ratchets for 1/4 and 3/8 drive, spark plug and tranny plug sockets in
1/2&quot; drive,
    deep 10mm and other assorted sockets, and 3&quot; and 10&quot; extensions

In the road trip box

Floor jack, rigging axe, 2 jack stands, 4-12&quot;x12&quot; pieces of plywood,
2-short 4x4 blocks, a gallon of gear oil, a quart of tranny fluid (for the
needy),
a quart of brake fluid, 6 quarts of oil, a can of hand cleaner, a roll of
shop towels,
jumper cables, 50&quot; of 3/4&quot; boat rope, 1/2&quot; breaker bar, 50' of 14 ga. wire,
flashlight,
duct tape, aluminum tape, a can of Sili-Kroil, clutch, accelerator and
speedo cables,
fan belts and heater hose.

And a 2'x4' piece of paneling (creeper, fits under floor mat),

It takes me less than ten minutes to transfer this payload from one Volks
to another. I never road trip without it. I have fixed my problems and those
of others for many years with this loaded in the bus. In the single cab, it
all
goes underneath in the treasure chest, in the bus, stowed in the cabinets or
the plywood box sits on the engine hump. I can do anything short of an
engine
rebuild, and I don't have to wait for a better prepared person to stop and
help me. When we 'caravan' to shows, it has come in handy more than once.
When
camping I can even get a little maintenance done if I'm in the mood to. I
haven't ever regretted taking too much stuff yet, but I'll pay closer
attention now that you've pointed out the error of my ways.
