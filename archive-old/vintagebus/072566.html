Subject: Re: [VB] Westy cot in non westy

As stated before no mods are needed to put an early (pre 68) cot in your bus, just the bracketsare needed. There are at least four different styles of childs cots; split bus (army green duck canvas, black round poles),  68-70-1 (round black poles, kahki colored canvas)) 71-? (square U channel poles, kahki canvas) and the telescopic pole style. 
 
 
FYI, A bay cot will not fit in your split with out cutting the canvas and poles. Bay's also had different brackets that the cot attatched too.
