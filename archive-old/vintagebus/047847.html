Glen wrote to the type 2 list :

&lt;&lt;Just looking over the ..&quot;Original VW Bus&quot;
by Laurence Meredith.. and I noticed that
he apparently has another book out..on
VW Vans....
anyone on the list previewed this book yet.
if so how does it compare with his first one?

I am just rebuilding my VW Van library,...any
other books , the list can reccomend?&gt;&gt;

&quot;Devine Right's Trip&quot;  Gurney Norman  copyright 1971

Not a bus tech or picture book, but a novel. The prologue is written by a VW
bus, and it takes place in and around a VW bus.

In print again at Amazon. com for $15.00

Advisory: Adult themes, adult language, lots of drugs. Very enjoyable reading.
