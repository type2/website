Kirin writ:

&gt; This ebay thing is getting out of hand i mean what do you folks do all day
&gt; all i know is im at school doing slave labor while your checking ebay is
it
&gt; just me or am i not getting something

I have noticed that the vast bulk of list mail is generated during weekdays,
which tells me that many if not most of the listees are getting their mail
and surfing the net while at work. As an employer, this troubles me.
