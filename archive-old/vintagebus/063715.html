Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

There's gotta be a better way to keep these wheels on the busses. 
I've heard story after story of wheels coming off VW's and had one do 
the same to me.

Is it the fact that they use lug bolts instead of studs and lugnuts? 
What are some recomendations for keeping the wheels on ....other than 
&quot;torque to the specs as per the bentley&quot;. We all know that. Sometimes 
doesn't seem to work though. 4000 miles isn't that much.

  I've never had another brand vehicle even have the lugnuts loosen up 
at all. Must be a flaw in the design of lug bolts. Why did they do it 
that way?
