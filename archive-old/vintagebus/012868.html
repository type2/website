I really like having my buses as close to original as possible, so what I have started doing is to take an old harness or two and make my own new harness.  I am about 2/3 or the way through doing one for my friend's 56 panel.  I don't know how it will work yet, but it looks beautiful.  I disected the whole thing and cut the bad parts of the wires off.  I then did the part that is somewhat odd.  I cut all of the wires in half, turned them around, and soldered them back together and covered them with shrink wrap.  This gave me original wiring colors that look like new.  I just have to see how well the spliced connections work once it is installed.  The one thing I would like to find is a source of the shrink tubing that is similar to the original.  The stuff I am using looks OK and works fine, but is not as smooth, glossy, and thin as the original stuff.  If anyone knows where to find the original stuff let me know.

Just out of curiosity, how close to original are the looms from Wiring Works?  I've heard they go in great and work great but I haven't heard how original looking they are.

Thanks,
Richard
