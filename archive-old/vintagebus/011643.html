&gt;They have to have metal to work with, but the results are incredable. 
Have to
&gt;give them an A+ rating if anyone needs this service. From the looks of 
things,
&gt;they ship everywhere. Looked at me funny for not wanting chrome.
&gt;
&gt;Now I have to find the rubber that goes between the parts in the front. 
Any
&gt;help? Went for paint today. 
&gt;----

I was looking for a bumper for my bus at Averres in Washington, and I 
got the advice of taking a used bumper to a shop that fixes these kinds 
of things. They told me &quot;you take it in, and then it dissapears, what 
you get wont look anything like what you left them with...but it's your 
original bumper&quot;! These places are amazing, I am glad you had such good 
luck with yours. To everyone else, dont junk that old bumper get it 
fixed!

Jason
