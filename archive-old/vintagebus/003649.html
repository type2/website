I just bought a 66 with little clip things (that hold canvas covers on the
back of whats called a utility in Oz) that look like mini brake bleeding
nipples. They screw in a small hole_at_ each corner of the window. Curtain wire
cut to length with end rings to clip over these holding a little tension. PO
says curtains up or down in seconds, elegant and neat I thought..

&gt; &quot;Second question.  I'm going to make some curtains and want to find out
&gt;how they're supposed to be hung.  Rods, or maybe wire?

CUT

&gt;the curtains up with screws with washers large enough to not pass
&gt;through the rings.  No noticeable loss of visibility and (I think) more
&gt;elegant a solution than curtain rods.
