&gt; So then it would be safe to assume that a Kombi would fall under, which
&gt; class?  I guess it's a commercial bus, afterall it has the black vent
&gt; latches.  But it was destined as a passenger bus on it's way to the
&gt; Westfalia factory to get dressed up.  ???

Ahh, but you have an early Westy (at least earlier than the SO42/44  series
I'm familiar with) .  Weren't those based on standards?  You know two tone
paint and all.

But I could be full of it for all I know.
