&gt; Here's a question...
&gt;
&gt; Were Riviera's the only campers to sport the long horizontal window 
running
&gt; down the length of the bus on the driver's side just aft of the driver's
&gt; door?
&gt; I'm asking because I just saw some pics of a sundial interior, and it 
looks
&gt; just like the interior on my 67' Riviera.  Unfortunately out here on the
&gt; East Coast, we don't have many Riviera's to compare with, so when the PO
&gt; told me it was a Riviera, I believed them face value.  Could I perhaps 
have
&gt; a Sundial?

   I haven't seen any Sundials with the long window on the drivers side. I 
have an 65 EZ. It is very close to a Sundial, which was what I thought it 
was at first, and it doesn't have one.
   I went to show in Seattle a couple of years ago and saw many different 
types of campers. A few of them had the long window you mention. After 
talking with the owners I found out about a few campers I had never heard 
of. American Camper, Coleman Camper and Riviera. These all had the long 
window.
   Alot of the campers have the same type of interior and even similar 
windows. This is due mostly because there are only a few companies that 
make conversion equipment. I used to do conversions on Dodge vans. All of 
the stuff came from Elkhart, IN. Most of the other conversion companies got 
their stuff from the same place. The difference in one conversion company 
&gt;from the other is mostly layout and accessories. So odds are, different 
'American' campers from the same year probably look very similar. It's the 
small things that make the difference. Plus, alot of the panels are hand 
made. So really, no two are probably identical. If we made the same mistake 
on a couple of vans, all the rest of the vans going to that dealer got the 
same mistake. That way they matched.
   If one layout didn't sell too good, the conversion company might change 
a few things for a few vans and then change it again. This makes it very 
hard to tell just what you've got. I'm sure you've already figured out that 
most of them did not put any ID tags on them. Who would have thought that 
30 years later someone would actually be interested in knowing that.

Hope this helps,
