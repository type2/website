 If I can't get a vacuum formed cap to stay on and seal 
well, I'll have to go with something more similar to the 
cap on a gallon of milk- inner and outer lip, more 
flexible material, etc.
 We also just got a new material that has a soft, padded 
vinyl like cap on it like its upholstered. Its used by 
RV manufacturers for interior panels and can be 
formed,lots of possibilities...hmmmm

&gt; The vent caps idea sounds cool, but how would you keep them on?

&gt; &gt;  Another idea of mine are caps that fit snugly over the 
&gt; &gt; fresh air vents to seal out drafts and water. 
&gt; &gt;  If your interested in either, or have any other ideas 
&gt; &gt; for formed, fabricated or machined plastic parts let me 
&gt; &gt; know. I am going to try to get started on drawings and 
&gt; &gt; molds in my spare time this weekend.
