&gt; All this talk about the bad H-4s has gotten me worried.  I ordered a set of
&gt; H4 upgrades about a year ago from The Bus Depot, all in preparation for my
&gt; ongoing resto.  Now I am worried that I might have gotten a set of these
&gt; poor-quality lights from India.  How can I tell for sure what lights these
&gt; are (is there something as obvious as &quot;Made in India&quot; on them)?

There is a symbol molded into the lens that shows compliance with the
european standard.  I believe that it is a circle with the capital letter
E in it, perhaps with a number (4?).  I don't have my lights handy to look
at, but that symbol should show that the lights were made to a decent
standard.
