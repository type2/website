well i'm back, actually since tuesday, but 4 messages to the list are lost
in cyberspace (damn computers)
bad camberg was a kick in the as#, no show in the U.S. will ever compare
the people, the parts (nos, nos, nos) who needs used, the buses
and i've been to way to many for to many years

my personal highlights of the event was of course the purchase of many nos
parts at less then U.S.A&gt; used prices and an adventurest ride around bad
camberg
in a 1943 KDF, that was a kick in the butt , then going on the countryside
tour
in the 1967 DOUBLE SLIDER,FACTORY ORANGE, 21 WINDOW WALKTHROUGH
DELUX, just for clarification the owner of this bus doesn't know it's real
history. has heard  all the rumors and scoffs at them, one day the truth
will come out, by the way
this bus is his daily driver in england.

saw just about everyone from the list who went except clara, knew she was
there
because roger nang kept buying all the steering coloum locks and clara was
telling him what years they would fit, till he finally bought the right one,
i guess he'll
have a couple for sale when he gets back,

talked to scofield who makes the sheet metal i sell and will be coming out
with some new items, ie: single cab cargo door rockers, double cab rockers
and a couple of other items, we'll keep working on new stuff as the needs
arise

DISC BRAKES have talked to my supplier frome brazil and they are checking on
importing a complete disc brake link pin front end

the return trip was good except for the minor mishap out side of parker
was crusing 70+ in the infamous swap bus (62 panel 1776 single port
rancho 3.99 tranny, doghouse cooler) in over a 100 degrees heat, and the bus
was running cool, anyway after being up for way to many hours
was passing a trucker who slowed and was hit in the windsheild bt some
chocolate foreign object, this trucker was out to kill me, put the pedal to
the metal, speedo pegged
for over 20 miles looking out the side window to see, trying to dial 911 on
the cell and
trying to keep away from the mad trucker, the fastest the bus ever went and
it held together, got to the outskirts of parker and lo and behold 2 cops
chit-chatting on the
side of the road, slammed the brakes, jumped out and started screaming as
the mad
trucker drove by, lights flashing the 1 cop took off and got the trucker the
other cop went to assist after it was over they came back to me and told me
they nailed him and shut him down, lucky for me 1 cop knew me and my shop
and justice was served.

there's more but i'll wait to see if this gets posted.
