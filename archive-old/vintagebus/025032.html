I just ordered some items from Izzy.  The contact info. as listed on the SOTO web page is:
Izzy's Safari Windows, 210 San Jose Ave Unit 7, San Jose, CA, 95125 Phone: (408) 295-7914
Description: Manufacturer of safari windows, side steps, round  mirrors and mirror arms.

I ordered Safari slider rivets, round mirrors, and a new item he is now offering.  He now sells the notched metal piece that the side sliding windows latch in to.  It is made of polished stainless steel and should be a big improvement over the original painted carbon steel piece that is often crusty from wear and water.  I have only recieved the rivets thus far which are not like the original flat head shoulder rivets from VW.  I was able to
locate the correct rivets from the Bus Stop (Charlie Hamill).
