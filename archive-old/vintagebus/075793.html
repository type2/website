Subject: Re: [VB] new floor panel

Josh,

Welcome to the wonderful world of vintage bussing! Wolfsburg West in
Corona, CA used to sell those floor parts, but you may just need a decent
welder to patch the area. A good metal worker can duplicate the floor
patterns easily.

Get yerself the John Muir manual and the Bentley 64-67 bus shop manual
reprint. Read the Muir book like a novel, and refer to the Bentley manual
for the pictures, until you get above the water.
