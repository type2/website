Here goes:

The &quot;left coast&quot; on North America is hardly a barometer for dealers nationwide and to make such an assumption is stretch of logic worthy of Al Gore....

&gt; &gt; As far as inspections go, for the most part here in NC, they are somewhat
&gt; &gt; of a farce. We regularly see cars that are in nowhere near &quot;passing&quot;
&gt; &gt; condition, with new stickers on them. I believe that if they are
&gt; &gt; properly done, they can be a benefit,

&gt; Why?  What makes the inspector more knowledgeable about my vehicle than I
&gt; am?  Why should I have pay someone else every year or two to prove that I
&gt; am innocent of driving an illegal vehicle?

Simple, I share the road with you and a lot of other vehicles: You may be competent in maintaining your vehicle, but others are not. If you have spent the time I have in a professional repair situation you would see that the majority of folks don't do preventative maintenance, adopting, rather, a &quot;wait 'til it breaks&quot; mentality. Inspections are more than pollution checks in most states, they are checks of the safety of the car in general. I personally do not want some halfwit with no brakes or slick tires, or a separated tie rod end, taking out either me or my family.... perhaps you do not have such cares about yourself or your loved ones, but I do.

&gt; So, it seems that if you were allowed to charge $50 for an inspection you
&gt; would be all for them.  Your only objection seems to be that you aren't
&gt; allowed to charge enough for them.

Again, you miss the point. Here the charge of $8.25, mandated by the state to do a half hour inspection was set in the '70s, when $2.65 was a reasonable hourly rate. We employ only certified technicians and invest a lot of money in their education. Most of our techs are college educated and have combined training comparable to that of other &quot;professionals&quot; - doctors, lawyers, PhDs etc. What do you do? Is your time not valuable in the market place? If not, come on over,  my house needs painting.....I may be able to afford you.
 
&gt; &gt; Just my two cents, but it is too easy to vilify automotive professionals,
&gt;  when most of us are collectors ourselves and we are on the same side.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, when they're pushing laws that are hazardous to my enjoyment of my
&gt; vehicle it is very easy.  Why should I have to make an unneeded trip, let
&gt; a stranger fiddle with, and possibly damage, my bus, and pay them to tell
&gt; me something I already
&gt; know just to line the pockets of the &quot;inspector&quot;?

Again, your short sightedness is pitiful. The majority of car enthusiasts and professionals are against the laws. It is corporate America and their pollution generating factories that are behind it. I can start an organization and call it anything that I want to. Look at who is funding this organization that you cite as evidence of some conspiracy. Again, you may be the exception in checking the condition of your car, but you are hardly the rule. Ever been almost taken out by some airhead soccer mom in a behemoth SUV (sorry soccer moms, but you know to whom I refer)... you think she is thinking that her brakes need checking? Not unless there is a noise..... then it is too late. Braking performance is already compromised. In addition, there is no lining of the pockets of anyone in the inspection biz.... the state is pushing for emissions checking here in our county. How many inspections would it take at even $20 to pay for a $65,000 machine that meets the states &quot;requirements?&quot;!
 No profit margin there, my friend.....

Again, if you will read with comprehension, I am no fan of the inspection process as it stands, either. As I said, if they are done *properly* they can be a benefit in letting certain elements of our population know they are an &quot;accident waiting to happen.&quot;  If you don't think people are oblivious, how many old Volvos or Toyotas have you ever seen tooling down the road belching so much smoke you could barely make out the &quot;Love Your Mother&quot; or &quot;Greenpeace&quot; stickers on the back.
