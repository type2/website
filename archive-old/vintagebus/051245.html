Subject: screen filter and Fuel petcock

hi all

i just put back my fuel petcock today but i lost my screen filter somewhere,
so i said Bah!, dont need this i have a fuel filter in the line... then i
screw the petcock (without the screen) and it doesnt seems to hold firmly,
so do i really need the screen filter, does this act as a washer to prevent
fuel leak ?? If not, why the petcock seems to be lousy... ?

thx for any input!!
mike
