&gt; I am the one who bought the OTHER yellow 21 window
&gt; that we saw on Ebay a
&gt; month back. My wife christened her Lucy. I am very
&gt; happy with her so far
&gt; (both her and Lucy). No real rust and original
&gt; straight metal.
&gt; Lucy is lowered, but I have never lowered a bus. Due
&gt; to its ride I expect
&gt; that springs were cut. Looking under the bus, what
&gt; is the best way to tell
&gt; lowering method? I would like dropped spindles to
&gt; restore ride (tell me if
&gt; this doesn’t work). Anyone know of a good VW
&gt; mechanics near Charlotte, NC?
&gt; 
&gt; Excited to be on list!
