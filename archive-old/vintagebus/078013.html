Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal removal, WMDs, and accelerator cable

&gt; I drove my double cab for a month or so with a piece of monofilament
&gt; fishing line tied to the throttle arm, out the engine compartment lid, over
&gt; the top of the tailgate and in the window right behind my left
&gt; shoulder.  Pull string to go faster, let go to go slower....
&gt; 
&gt; This had the disadvantage of making me drive with one hand off the wheel
&gt; all the time, making shifting a bit dodgy, but the stretchyness of the line
&gt; prevented those jackrabbit starts.

And I thought I was living on the edge driving my DC from CA. To Utah w/ the
accelerator pedal duct taped to the floor mat.  Had to use my big toe to
return the pedal, which meant no shoe &amp; it was 15-20 degrees outside!

Grin,

Tom Buese-drove the DC for the 1st time in a long time yesterday in 50 deg.
Weather-sweet!
