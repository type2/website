everyone who responded to my post is getting this reply as well as the
list...

I have received some interest in the spice rack from my ez-camper...it appears
as though most of you just want it to make you own...so I have therefore made
some drawings of the rack...with dimensions. I will try to get some photos to
go with it...then I can make a .pdf of the info. Eventually I plan on doing
drawings of all the camper parts, and putting them in .pdf format. as for
condition of the current rack, I would say decent, a little dirty, but solid.
The only reason I am gettin rid of it, is that I am redoing the other
cabinets, which are not in such great shape...

The drawings of the rack are almost done...I just have the door left.
Unfortunately upon insp;ection I have realized that their is one piece of trim
that I have no idea how to remake...it is a piece of aluminum that is bent in
a curve to go around the rounded door. I think I will be unable to part with
this part of the rack, unless someone has some ideas on how to make this...

I could also make autocad files for those of you with access to CAM machinery,
whereby you could get the machine to cut the pieces for you...the only problem
I don't really have website to post this stuff too..any takers...Thom?
