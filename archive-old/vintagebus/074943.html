Subject: 74 stroke crank deal!!!

  Being the response on the cases has been spo good I have another deal for
you all offered by my importer.
  BRAND NEW cast 74 counterweighted cast cranks. I know there is a lot of
talk on cast cranks, but ever new VW lon block has them and I know of these
engines out there with over 60,000 miles and stiill going strong. Now I
wouldn't build a hot dog hi po engine with one but a low compression engine
not abussed will last 1000's of miles.
  Anyway here is the deal $175.00 dollars each, brand new, never used,
static balanced, build that low compression stroker of your dreams for the
same price almost as a stock 69 counterweighted crank.
