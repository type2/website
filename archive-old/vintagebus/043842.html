&gt;I have heard many stories about the heat flaps and Thermostats.

Ask five people, get seven opinions...


&gt;Some people remove them and say that they are not needed.

BAP, an Arizona parts chain, doesn't install them on new
turnkeys.  I was somewhat dismayed by this when I received mine.
I'm not even sure the new fanshrouds they use even accomodate
the flap mechanism...  The minute my engine warranty is up,
I plan to put the original shroud back on there.  (Doing so 
now would void a 12 month warranty).  

I do not believe any harm is being caused by running w/o a 
thermostat (for me, in Phoenix).  On the other hand, it does
take quite a while to warm up, even on a hot morning.  I know
this would not be the case if I had a t-stat.

&gt;Some people think that if you remove the flaps then the air does not
&gt;circulate correctly over the jugs and prevents proper cooling.

I'll say that's horseshit until someone demonstrates it with calibrated
measurements under controlled conditions.  Same goes for those plastic
ears people cover their intake vents with.


&gt;Others seem to think that if you weld the flaps open that is ok

a piece of wire would do the job too, and the next owner would be able
to put it back together...

&gt;and other
&gt;believe that if they do not function correct, the oil might not get hot
&gt;enough to be able to lubricate the engine right.  

Now that part I can definitely see.  Even in a warm climate, (Phoenix is
a bit more than &quot;warm&quot;), it takes a while for that toaster to heat up to
operating temperature.  I can easily imagine a vw in a cold high altitude 
environment never getting warm enough to be within operating range.  That's
why VW put a thermostat on there.  

I've asked a lot of people in Phoenix, several very experienced mechanics,
what their opinion is, and they've all been against the idea of putting 
the tstat system on there.   I wonder what mechanics in northern colorado
or wisconsin think about it.

&gt;I have searched most sites and can not find them.  Best I
&gt;can find is the thermostat alone.


Where did you find the t-stat?  
I'm missing the bracket.  I know damn well I won't be able to convince a 
professional mech to put it together for me either.
