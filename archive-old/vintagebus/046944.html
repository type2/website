re adjusting carbs with the big screw and the little screw-   how I was 
taught to do it is screw the big screw in till it starts to die, then 3 half 
turns (or one and a half full turns) out.   Then ditto on the little screw.  
now this has changed things, so go do that to the big one again. Repeat till 
both are settled.    when I am done fiddling with the adjustments this way, 
it tends to run sweet,  works for me at least.
......
NQ quoth:

valved -everything was okay except the #4 intake was tight.  The engine

still ran like crap.  Then I decided against my better wishes to monkey with

the large adjusting screw on the carb.  My gosh!  The thing was turned out

aout 8 times.  This screw should NEVER be turned out more than a half of

turn max.  I turned it to a half turn, did some more tweaking and the Westy

runs like a top.  I test drove it around the lot and then I cleaned up the

plugs, picked up the tools, and came home.
