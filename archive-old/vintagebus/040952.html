&gt; &gt; Does anyone in Colorado know if JB Heaters is still in business?  I have
&gt; &gt; been trying for 2 weeks with no answer.

&gt; There is a guy named Arkady Mirvis on the Type 3 list that is in
&gt; the heater business. I think I remember some discussions about him on this
&gt; list a while back.


JB specializes (specialized?) in the Southwind heaters, whereas Mirvis'
specialty is the Eberspachers.  (Incidentally, Mirvis was booted off of the
Type 2 list after posting a long pro-Nazi, anti-minority diatribe to the
list.  Whether this affects your desire to do business with him is of course
a matter of individual choice. Myself, I'd freeze first...)
