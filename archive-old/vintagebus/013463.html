, but our new 12v engine finally showed up
today, and it looks liek the bell-housing already had
the areas machined
away to fit the 12v flywheel. I know our engine is
original, but ithink
12v's was and option in '65, is there a chance the
factory clearancedthe
tranny?  Just curious.  Jim

I have a 65 Std Delux with the 12volt option and I can
tell you that the Bell Housing on my bus is NOT CUT
for a late style 12volt flywheel.
