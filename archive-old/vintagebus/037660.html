Subject: Anti-theft measures

Hello all,
    Inspired and outraged by the tragic stories of bus theft, I went to talk to
a friend of mine who works at Trimble here in the Bay Area.  They make GPS
receivers and goodies.  Asked about a car tracking system...ie, something you
can install in your car so that when it is stolen you can id it's exact
position.
    To my surprise he said that there are such units already commercially
available.  He explained that they are being built into new cars in several
forms (eg-there's one that, working in conjunction with your cell phone, will
call 911 when the airbags are activated and report location of vehicle).
    He was, however, skeptical about retrofitting them into a vehicle.  He said
that anyone knowing what they were doing could disarm the system with a bit of
tin foil or even a gum wrapper.  But, knowing how clever you all are at
installing things into your stock vehicles while maintaining a stock look, I am
of the opinion that such a unit could be successfully hidden.  He's looking up
some more specific information, which I will pass along as soon as it is
available.
    Although I know this info is little comfort to those who are looking for
their lost loved ones, I hope this lead turns into a way to help insure that
busses everywhere might find some extra measure of protection.  

Hope this is of interest...
