Uncle Jerry Jess is having overheating problems....

&lt;&lt; during my quest to find a way to get my 1776 
motor to run a little  cooler in the 111+ heat of 
Phoenix--with a 3.88 rancho tranny--the heat  is 
mainly do to high rpms as i have been told. &gt;&gt;

What high rpms are you talking about here??
With 25&quot; tall tires (close to stock and what alot
of splittie owners tend to use), a 3.875 ring and
pinion coupled with a splined late style .82 4th 
gear,  the 1.26 reduction gears of a 1964-1967
style gearbox,  at 65mph your engine is turning 
around 3500 and at 75 its a touch over 4000rpm.
That seems to be a fairly normal rpm range to
me and shouldn't be a cause in the overheat
problem.  I would think that there is some other
reason that causing it rather than trans gearing. 

 &lt;&lt; if the high rpms are due to the lower gears in the
 reduction boxes, why not have taller reduction 
 gears??   like 1-1  gears!!! ........&gt;&gt;  

I've thought of that as well and it shouldn't be too 
big a mechanical hurtle to do.   Transaxle gears 
handle that amount of power all the time and come 
in a variety of different ratios.  I could have a set 
machined that would allow easier interchangeability 
so you can pop off a cover and bolt a different ratio 
in depending on what you need the bus to do.  

What it boils down to is legal liability.   We'll play 
the *what if* game here.  What if I built a lower 
ratio'd redux gear and you  installed it in your bus.  
Cruising down the highway at a happy 75mph that 
said gear lets fly and takes out the redux housing.  
Drum and wheel enter low Earth orbit and you pile 
into that oncoming mega-18 wheeler loaded down 
with gasoline and cattle.  Instant flambe!  Cars 
stack in from both directions and the Feds start 
looking at known Middle Eastern terrorist groups to
see just who could be responsible.  Meantime, your
Insurance Co., whose bedoobies are being slow 
roasted over the embers of the 85 car/truck/cow/bus 
pile-up, sift through the rubble and note that you had 
just purchased a set of 'Thermonuclear extra-low 
redux gears' from me and decide to ring me up.  
Now the mad rush begins to see which lawyer can 
successfully part me from my 15 year old couch as 
the other stuff I have is currently residing in other 
lawyer's dwellings as payment for legal assistance
and my life is over.  Granted this is an extreme 
example but one that I have mulled over.  

The post-'64 stock ratio of 1.26 combined with a 
3.875 R/P and a .82 4th seem to work very nicely 
so there really isn't a great enough demand for me 
to whip some sets up and don my bullet proof 
underwear for when something goes astray.
