&gt;I'm lookin' for a little help. Perhaps you could help me.
&gt;
&gt;I have a problem with my '67 deluxe. The right rear tire had quite a bit
&gt;of side to side movement indicating the outer bearing of the reduction
&gt;box was shot. John Muir's idiot book pretty much confirmed this. Great,
&gt;so I replaced it and the output shaft was nice and solid. I had it
&gt;pretty much back together before I realized that I had forgotten to
&gt;replace the brake backing plate between the reduction box and the oil
&gt;seal retainer. I went back and did this but now the slop of the output
&gt;shaft remains even with the new bearing and the only change has been the
&gt;addition of the backing plate. I was hoping you may have some idea's,
&gt;I'm fresh out.
&gt;I hope I haven't imposed on you too greatly. Thanks for your time.
