 I am not saying this is a good or bad product...  But &quot;made in China&quot; does
 not get my $ vote.  Remember they are still a communist country.  Or have we
 all forgotten about Tienamin Square and the recent plane events.  Also I
 have not seen China helping NATO in this time of need, maybe they are on the
 other side?
  &gt;&gt;
not to start any new tiraid but i was in china earlier this year and found it 
and the people to be wonderful, friendly.   ( of course not withstanding 
they,re human rights violations or the incedent with the plane, which 
happened while i was there.)

what made me write was something i read a few days ago that china donated 10 
million dollars to the relief fund.
i just thought that was interesting.
