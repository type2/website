Message-ID: &lt;3745A814.3288_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Come one come all, caravan to the Snak Shak with the Aircooled All
Stars of Pittsburgh, PA.  We're leaving from the Billco VW delership in
Wexford (rt. 19) at 6:00am this Sunday (May 23rd).  We'll be taking the
turnpike most of the way to the Snak Shak in Chambersburg, PA, if you
want to hook up with us along the way that's cool too.
	The People's Car Club is hosting this Show and Shine.  It's a
noncompetative show and there is no swap meet, just a nice relaxing day
with your VW and friends.  This show is free to everyone.  All VW models
in all conditions are welcome.
	We hope to see some list members there.  If you'd like to come with us
get a hold of me by phone and leave a message.

Later,
Aaron Badertscher
