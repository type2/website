All this talk of the classic and with it just a few weeks away, I was
reminded of an adventure I thought some of you might find amusing.
  Last year I drove my jetta to the classic (No, I don't like driving that
better. Yes, I'm lazy and want to get there fast) with my g/f and her
brother. he was going with $3000 in his pocket and intent to buy a single
cab to drive home. He had been looking around AZ for some time but hadn't
found anything nice for a decent price (go figure).
   After getting a flat tire { aren't vintage cars supposed to be the only
ones to have probs? :)  } we made it to the hotel and arose early to hit the
SOTO show. Rumors were floating that a flatbed truck was seen heading that
way with 2 single cabs in tow. We kept our eyes peeled being that there
wasn't anything to buy at SOTO. We spotted the flat bed with 2 nice looking
trucks, a 66 and 56  and made our way over to it. Before we had even walked
up, a guy(we'll call him JOE for confusions sake) was already cutting a deal
with the driver! *gasp*.  &quot;How much does that guy want for the 66?&quot; I asked
JOE.    &quot;1800, but I'm gonna buy it for 1500&quot; he responds. &quot;I'll give you
2000!!!&quot; I shout to the driver as he starts to pull away. Seeing how this
wasn't my money, I had no prob spending it  }:-) . I could see my friend
already had visions of himself driving the 66 so I knew he was addicted.
Well needless to say the driver said &quot; ok meet me in the back parking lot, I
gotta find a place to park this rig&quot; and I then received an glance of evil
&gt;from JOE who thought he had it. So as the driver pulled away, my friend and
JOE began the &quot;I'm not running but walking super fast, don't try to go
faster than me cause its mine&quot; dance through the show to the other side
while the driver took the long way around. they met at the other side and
JOE pulled us to the side and starts trying to cut a deal with us to walk
away so he could buy it. When all was said and done, my friend gave JOE
500BUCKS to walk away! (d_at_mn guess he really wanted it). The flat bed driver
became greedy after hearing all of this and then wouldn't let the 66 go for
any less than 2500!... }:-(
    We drove it around the parking lot and it was clean but then I heard the
evil rod knock. It didn't matter to him. He was already deciding what he was
gonna name it :)
    We didn't even make it back to the hotel. engine was history. Called AAA
and towed it to the holiday inn. We didn't have a towbar and him having 3000
in it already, he wasn't about to pay to have it towed back to AZ. So we did
the next best thing. He bought a tow ROPE (not tow bar,  a rope) and I towed
it back to AZ with my JETTA! Needless to say, I never was doing under 80
miles an hour on the open main highway(yes I'm serious) , and i'll never
forget the look of fear in his eyes in the rear view mirror or the odd looks
&gt;from the ppl I was passing. I know what your thinking...&quot;80?!?!?&quot; ....yes.
no reason to go slow once we hit top speed and no reason to brake (luckily).
We managed to make it back with no probs except for a few white hairs on his
head.
   Guess I'm nuts. or friendly . or just plain stupid. depends on how you
look at it. :)
