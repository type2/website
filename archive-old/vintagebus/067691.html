Subject: Re: [VB] working buses

There was a thread like this on the Vanagon_dot_com list a year or two ago.  
Something like &quot;The heaviest thing I ever hauled in my vanagon...&quot;    
It was pretty amusing, everything from firewood, full size side by side 
fridge (mine personally ), go carts, gravel, motorcycles, you name it.  
When I get some time, the fridge pictures are going on my webpage.
