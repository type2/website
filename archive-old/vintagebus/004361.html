So I'm cruising up the freeway tonight, and I see this sweeeeeet '64 beetle.
As I come up and pass it (on the right), I look over, smile, stick out my
left arm, and give 'em the old thumbs up.

The guy looks at me like I'm crazy! The other dude in the passenger seat
even looks scared!

......if only I'd been driving my bus instead of the motorcycle. There's
nothing worse than seeing an old VW on the road and not being in mine.
Sometimes I can drive the bus all over the place and not see another old VW,
then I hop in another vehicle and ...there all over the place!
