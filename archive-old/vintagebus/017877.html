I still have the 67-only 2/3-1/3middle seat frame and
rear seat w/ original caramel browmn upholstery for
sale. 

I'm going to schlep them up to Solvang early Saturday
morning and try to sell them there.

I had originally hoped to get $450 for the pair or
$250 each, but if anyone here on the list will be
there and is interested, $375 for both or $200 each.

Here's a pic of them, I have plenty more pics if
interested.

And if you see me at the show, say &quot;Hi.&quot; I'll be the
one wearing the white T-shirt with &quot;bus seats for
sale&quot; scribbled on it.

67  deluxe sunroof with no cloth and bent bows, but
has one NOS visor.
