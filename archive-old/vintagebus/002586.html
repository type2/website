  Good morning listees,
I need help.  I am in need of a 'black' steering wheel.  Mine has way too many cracks.
If you have a wheel you can sell that has minimal cracks please let me know.  It would
be for a '61 bus.  I have a nice wheel on my '59 SC with just four cracks but I hate the 
SC to become a 'parts bus'.  
Please let me know.
  Lou in Havasu
