Subject: S0-23 Questions - buy or not?

Volks,

I came across a restored 1960 SO-23 Westy yesterday,
the guy is asking somewhere around $10,000 for it. 
It's the nicest split window bus that I've ever seen
around these parts, nice enough that I'm considering
trading my cherry '82 diesel westy (+ cash) for it,
but I'd like some input from others who have more
knowledge about the early westies before I make a
move.

Here's what I know - the Bus lived much of it's life
on the West Coast, and was restored out there before
coming back east.  

The good:

It has the complete large tent and the roof rack.  Not
original paint, but a very nice respray.  Nice
straight repainted bumpers.  Decent tires (not sure if
proper load index though...), brakes and tranny all
good.  No loud whine from the redux boxes, tranny
stays in gear, and shifter play is minimal. Converted
to 12 volt (good and bad I guess...), 40HP
(non-bastard).  Runs nice, minimal play in steering
box (quite nice!).  I completely inspected the
underside - nice and solid w/ surface rust only (best
underside I've personally viewed).  Has original
church key and radio block off plate.  The interior is
complete, w/ a few exceptions noted below.  Window
seals have all been replaced in the last five years,
as have the door seals, etc.  Basically, all new
seals.  :-)  Deluxe campbox interior, including
icebox.  Original upholstery on the rear camper seats
still!  Complete camper interior (w/ 2 exceptions -
glasses and ???netting??? - see below).  Tent,
outside, and inside upholstery all match!  (ironic, as
I'm color blind and have a helluva time matching
colors.....)

The bad:  
1) Considerably staining on the ceiling wood.  (Kind
of cool in a way though, gives it a nice patina....)
2) *Considerable* bubbling from the paint on the pass.
side roof - above the rain gutter - which is kind of
sCaReY.  My guess is that the sub-hatch leaked, and
that this is coming through from the INSIDE.... :-( 
(This is the only rust I could find on the painted
surfaces tho, and I went over them very thoroughly -
didn't have a magnet for bondo though....)  Will if I
go back. (Respray was 5+ years ago fwiw.)
3) Incorrect front door panels and front seat
upholstery, although they are nicely done.  Not a huge
deal to me, although I'd probably redo them at some
point in the future if I bought the bus.

The missing:  
1) Appears to have mid-60's mirrors on the outside
(both sides)...(although I may be wrong here.)  
2) No cups, no shot glasses (has breadbox and holder
though.  
3) Doesn't appear to have the correct wiper arms.  
4) Chrome hubcaps (although these may be correct -
didn't look at M-codes....)  
5) Does not have the cargo net in the back, although
it may not have had one (optional I've read...)

In summary, I first heard about this bus several years
ago.  Finally tried to track it down a few months ago,
did, and found out it's for sale.  Viewed the bus
(it's in storage) on short notice, very clean engine
(inside and underneath).  Not sure when rebuilt, or
original miles...  But it's the nicest splitty I've
ever seen outside a show, and the only thing holding
me back at this point is the bubbling on the roof. 
Plus the fact that I really don't want to pay a whole
lot more than it's worth, as there's one on the
thesamba_dot_com now (a '59) for 11K.

What do you folks think?  Any and all input would be
GREATLY appreciated!

Regards, ~j.
