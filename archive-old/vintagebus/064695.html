&lt;&lt; Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter and
 the later '66 and up versions.  Does the earlier version extend further below
 the cab floor?  Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to 
get
 a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.
 
 Thanks,
 Aaron
  &gt;&gt;
the 66.3-67 kind the front shift rod under the bus hangs on a bump.  This 
makes it really easy to install the shift stick by yourself.

the difference in the sticks thems selves?  one has more distance from the 
thingy that the holder downer upside down cup goes one and the 'ball' at the 
bottom.  

It's really much simpler to get the kind that fits your bus.
