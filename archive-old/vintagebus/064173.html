Subject: Rebuilding Transmissions

I'm in the process of gathering parts for a rebuild to the '67 with more favourable gearing. Having taken apart a couple of these, the spade end of the axles are usually worn, side gears occasionally cracked, and fulcrum plates worn and sometimes chewed up.

Can you buy the fulcrum plates, side gears, and axles new or reconditioned?? Or does one look for the best used parts available??
