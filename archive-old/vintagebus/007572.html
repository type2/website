&gt; &gt; would appriciate any experience other people here have had in reducing
&gt; &gt; freeway noise in their bus.

In all seriousness, I crank up the stereo and wear earplugs.  That way I can
feel the music and keep out most of the engine noise.  It's surprising how
refreshing your ears feel once you stop and get out.  It's like you just
woke up or something.
