Subject: I bought a 65 Kombi.....
References: &lt;000d01bfe63c$fb420f60$a996ccd1_at_eamsm&gt;

Just thought i would write to the list....   I finally got myself a splitty...
after owning several other aircooled VWs...   well this one was found in a barn
in New York state.    It is a 1965 Kombi, velvet green, ( well the at least the
top part....  the bottom was painted darker after some funky rocker work, but
that will be fixed.)  the Odometer shows 40K miles, which I think may be
acurate, considering the shape of most of the van, the popout windows are some
of the cleanest original ones i have ever seen, and NO rust around any of the
windows...  the front nose is very clean ( even the front inner panel is
solid..)  the last time the van was on the road was 1984.   I has a very neat
VWoA/Stewart Warner gas heater, mounted under the parcel tray, very clean
installation also....  it also came with a VW cab divider, unfortunatly someone
at some point cut 2 small holes in it for speakers..  oh well.......   I pick
the bus up in April, It will be in nice dry storage over the winter months...
it's going to be a long winter... LOL.....

I have pics posted......
