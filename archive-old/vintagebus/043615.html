&gt;I didn't *stall* the '60, it stalled itself!  &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I think it was a combo of brakelights, turn signal, and engine electricl
&gt;draw coupled with no battery to take up the slack.  As soon as I pushed
&gt;in the clutch, it was done.

Probably what happened was the cut-out relay in the regulator opened
up.  This disconnects the generator (I think by killing the field
current) when the voltage gets below a certain point, to keep the
battery from discharging through the generator or even trying to 
run the generator like a motor.  Normally the battery is there to
fall back on but since you didn't have one, you were out of luck.

Probably about the only way you would have got out of it is if you
romped on the gas right after you hit the clutch and &quot;caught&quot; it
before things got too far out of hand.  Or, maybe if you revved it
a little before hitting the clutch, which isn't the best for the
clutch (or for trying to stop at the sign) but it would keep the
generator RPMs up.

Next time, skip the turn signal and just stick your hand out the
window.  :)  (Even though this is still a legal signal, the chance
that younger drivers will have any idea what the h_at_ll you are doing
is low, IMHO...)

I wonder how well one of those small sealed gel-cell batteries
would work for an emergency Bus battery.  You would probably NOT
want to run the starter on it (just push-start) but it would provide
the &quot;fall back&quot; for when the generator cuts out.  I wouldn't want
to run more than a few miles this way, and running at night (lights)
probably wouldn't work at all, but it might make the difference between
being on the side of the highway and being well off the road in the
gas station parking lot.
  
&gt;So I hop out and *push* this beast out of the intersection.  Guess 
&gt;what?  That thing weighs a lot more than a bug!

Sounds to me like Thom owes you at least a beer (or whatever) for
your trouble... :)
