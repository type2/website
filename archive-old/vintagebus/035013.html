&lt;&lt; Is this normal, or does it indicate an electrical problem? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Normal, but dangerous to your wirng if not your whole bus!  You need to take 
apart the switch, clean all interior and exterior connections.  If you have a 
pre-1961 screw terminal switch you really need to solder all the riveted 
connections together in there.  If you have a later slip on connection switch 
it still would be a good idea to solder these!  If it still run too warm 
clean all the wiring connections.  In the end you will have a cooler wiring 
system and much brighter lights.  Eric&amp;Barb
