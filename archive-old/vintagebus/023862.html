&gt; On a VERY sad note: Danny Morganelli's beautiful '62 suffered a fire on the
&gt; way to the event. I saw part of the video, and it looks like a complete loss.

	I offer my condolences to the grieving owner... and am composed enough
to tell my own story.
	About a month ago, I was driving the '65, when I stopped to aid a group
of people who were blocking one lane of traffic on the main drag just
east of campus. I could see smoke roiling up from their hood as I passed
them and whipped in front and parked. I grabbed my extinguisher and ran
back to the car. They had already grabbed their personal belongings and
had high-tailed it down the side of a hill, awaiting a possible
explosion...? So, I discharged the extinguisher on the fire, which
immediately put it out. The exposed air filter was still smoldering, but
I just grabbed it and threw it over on the sidewalk.
	The fire department arrived about 5 minutes later... the car would have
been toast, IMHO. The driver had help on the way, so i left.
	I *should* have immediately gone and obtained another extinguisher, but
I put it off for one reason or another. I wish i had gotten another one
immediately.
	2 days later my bus caught fire, the result of a sudden and
catastrophic fuel leak within the confines of the engine compartment. I
had the engine compartment open about 15 minutes before it happened, and
didn't notice anything out of the ordinary... I was robbing battery
power to inflate a low tire.
	But, the bus quit on me and that's when I noticed the smoke emanating
from the vents... I grabbed the dog and the extinguisher and made a
rapid egress. No more oomph in the extinguisher, as I had used it
already. All i could do was wtch it burn until the fire dept. got there.
Luckily, they were _at_ 2 (long distance) blocks away, and wasted no time
getting there once they were called by a passing motorist. They saved my
bus from total destruction, and for that I was profusely thankful. The
bus will have to be repainted and the motor cleaned up, but the damage
was slight compared to many vehicle fires that I've seen.
	The fuel line between the pump and the carb is the likely suspect, but
I can't be sure since everything in that area is melted. It was fine
before...
	The moral of the story: &quot;...buy, and carry with you, two 15 lb. fire
extinguishers...(Hoover)&quot;... I had really been meaning to get them, due
to the thoughts/convictions i had still about the Fire Extinguisher
Thread of recent months. If I had purchased them as i planned, I would
have had to merely replace a few components and not worry about painting
the bus again. But, I procrastinated, and thus deserved this fate
perhaps. 
	So I recommend that all of you get the extinguishers if you don't
already have them. My bus came perilously close to being completely
immolated... I'm sad about it, but I believe repairing the fire damage
will help me remember next time to get the extinguishers filled ASAP..
