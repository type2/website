Subject: 40 HP re-visited

Ok, so I finally get the flywhhel off of a 1500 engine I have (from a 64 bus) and it fits fine on the 40 HP engine I have, there is no O-ring? on it.  AM I WRONG?? The 1500 FW seems to fit the 40 HP fine.  I did look in the &quot;How to re-build your VW Engine Book&quot; and it seemed to say that 1500's up to '65 had the same flywheel configuration as the 40 HP.  Can anyone definitively confirm or deny this??  
BTW, There's too much good info on this list to let the butt-heads take over. All you TRUE Bus-heads please stay patient and the let the sh*t currently hitting the fan settle down before you leave forever, because I STILL NEED A LOT OF HELP WITH THIS ENGINE! ;-)
