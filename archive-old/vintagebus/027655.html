This is one of my grandfathers friends bus.  His father was the original
owner i believe...then his son got it after he passed away.  Contact me
if you have any questions.  I have one picture of it...but nothing
really detailed.  The bus is in VA.

1967 Campmobile, Westfalia interior, roof rack, carefully maintained
mechanically, some lower panel and exterior rust, needs some gaskets (no
idea what that means), all records including original owners manual.
Owned only by 2 families.  Less than 62,000 miles, front seat cloth
replaced with vinyl, step mounts into jack points below double doors.
Curtains need replacing, heater tube missing, tent missing.  $6,000.

that is from the ad that he wrote to me....  the bus is a greenish
color...looks to be original, has both bumpers, elephant ear mirrors and
a pop top...
Thats about all i know.
