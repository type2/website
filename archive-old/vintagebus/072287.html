Ronnie, All,

Began swapping trans in earnest this weekend.

Found out that the loud banging I had described to the list earlier was not 
the trans, but the splines inside my passenger rear drum being ground flat!

Any ideas on that?
great you diagnosed it!
Get a replacement drum!   sounds pretty simple.   wait, are the splines gone 
in the drum, or on the stub axle shaft?


&gt;Putting in the new trans from type2parts_dot_com anyway for good measure.

I wouldn't bother if the old one was good.  but hey it's your time.
............................

&gt;I believe you have to work from the RGB's to get the axles off the trans 
case, correct?  I'm using Mike Gensler's write up in the type2 library as my main 
reference for lack of a Bentley as of yet.
......................
have teh tranny out?  brakes off?   okay, yes take outer cover off box, then 
circlip, then upper outer bearing.   it's a press fit, I've done it with two 
screwdrivers, and made a special thingy for the annoying/stuckish ones, that 
goes to a puller.   

then undo the bolts around ther center and the axle tube/box should be able 
to be pulled (yanked) off teh tranny, leaving the axle in place.   Remove axle, 
scope fulcrum plates and crown gears and axle spades for wear.   There is 
loads in archives.

------------------------------------
RGB's are split, is it the upper-outer bearing that is removed? I tood a 
circlip off of a bearing and I believe that was the one.

I hear these bearings are expensive and mine look brand new, so I don't want 
to destroy them. I bought a 3 arm puller that I will probably have to grind 
down to fit between the bearing and gear behind it. Is there any better/easier 
way to do this job?
..................
The expensive one is the lower outer one for 64-67s (big nutters)  But I 
reuse them if they look great.
