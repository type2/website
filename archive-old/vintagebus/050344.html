Subject: Misc. Friday stuff

My B-Day was the 27th of May. (turned 31) My wife and kids got me a lot of
the bus merchandise I see in the front of RMM catalog (bus tie, beer glass,
stickers, ect.) The tie is nice 'cause it strikes up conversation. Good for
getting tips on old VW's &quot;out on the farm&quot; and stuff like that (if you know
what I mean). Pretty cool. Got some spending money allowance for parts as
well. Funny how my wife &quot;allows&quot; me money from my paycheck for VW stuff.

Interesting thing about being married. Look at how short of a time it takes
our un-married list leader Thom to do one of his whirlwind show winning
reso's. No look at me. 5 years married with 2 kids, first place winner of
the award for &quot;longest resto of a daily driver bus seen in a movie starring
an original cast member from &quot;Welcome Back Kotter!&quot;. I love my wife and
kids...but I'd sure like to be able to finish my bus sometime soon! Just
not enough time it seems:(

On a non-bus related note, my wife's B-Day was the 29th of May (she turned
29). Check out the cool present I made for her:

It took about 3 weeks or so away from bus work. Between that and her new
'70 vert, I havn't done any real bus work in about a month or month &amp;
1/2!!! No one to blame but myself!

Are you young guys listening!!!! Fix 'em up while your young and
single...or be content squeezing time in while you can.

ramble, ramble, ramble, ramble..............
