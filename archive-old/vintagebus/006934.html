ps. sorry I couldn't stop by and see you, but the northern weather patterns
made me take the lower route home.

Man he doesn't care what shape they are in does he?  :-)  That is one rusty
bus!  I guess with time, effort, and a mental attitude of &quot;where do you find
one of these anymore?&quot; one could successfully restore it OR at least make
dough parting it out...

I still think you guys should stay down there and let us MidWesterners find
these buses - you keep crossing the lines! :-) :-)
