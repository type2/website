My experience with chemical paint stripper is that you should remove ALL
layers of paint where you strip it. No matter how careful you are you run
the risk of the chemical getting into a bottom layer that you want to keep
and don't remove. When you paint over it it will more than likely &quot;lift&quot;.
If you only want to remove a top layer or two, do it the right way using
sandpaper or a stripper wheel. I personally use sandpaper in this
situation. If you use the chemical stripper, make sure you get ALL the
paint off. And don't use it in tight spots unless you plan to follow up
with sandblasting in those areas (for the same reason...lifting). It's
sometimes hard to get the paint with the stripper in it out of those
areas.Check my site for my experience with chemical stripper on my '59 Kombi.
