Subject: RE: [VB] Rear Bumper &quot;Hole&quot; for Westy Tent

Being that there is really no difference in the rear bumpers except one is
pointed and the other is slanted, I would measure the slash from the over
rider tube and drill it in the same place on the pointed.

Subject: [VB] Rear Bumper &quot;Hole&quot; for Westy Tent


List:

My friend Joe, who owns a '64 subhatch Flipseat Westy, needs help in
locating exactly where to drill the hole in his rear bumper to accept the
tent pole support for a large tent with privy room.  Normally this would be
straight forward, if he had a slash rear bumper.  But since his camper came
with a slash front bumper and pointed rear bumper (he also has a sales
brochure showing this configuration) we aren't sure exactly where the hole
goes.

A nice, clear digital photo would probably be good enough, and/or some clear
description of where it is located in relation to the end, top, center
horizontal peak running the length of the bumper, etc.

Any help is appreciated.

Robert
