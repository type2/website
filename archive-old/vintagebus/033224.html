how far is it to LA for you- and you are talking in a bout a week or two?  
hm-  You need to check the brakes, change the oil, and gas (old gas makes 
your engine run really hot, if not do wierder things like make the valves 
stick), and battery, make sure all the wiring works.  Tape the windsheilds in 
place?   cant you get seals?   and put that side window etc in place.  Then 
you get to wonder will the motor be happy suddenly taking a __________ mile 
drive in the hot weather.   I like to drive a round town a few hundred miles 
to work it out and warm it up sort of before taking a trip.   Is this a motor 
you used to drive on?   Nah, dont think you'ld get much sleep.

 &gt; Hi,
 &gt;
 &gt; The question is:  Should I tape the windshields back in for the
 &gt; weekend and drive on down to OCTO and Irvine, or should I just drive
 &gt; the %#anger truck?
 &gt;
 &gt; The DD has not been started in 2 years, the oil is at least 4 years
 &gt; old, the battery is dead, the gas may be congealed in the tank, half
 &gt; the nose skin has been removed, the passenger head light is missing
 &gt; ( maybe I can duck tape it into place ), the jelousies on the
 &gt; passenger side have been removed, and I have no spare time unless I
 &gt; stop sleeping.
 &gt;
 &gt; I need your votes. If the yays beat the nays, I stop sleeping at least
 &gt; until I hit the freeway on Friday to go to West Coast Classics.
