Since you still have air in the lines I am very suspect of the original
master cylinder you haven't replaced.The plunger can corrode and have pits
in it so when you pump the pedal it allows air into the system.especially if
the system was &quot;dry&quot; for any length of time !
 I know the 67 m.c.'s are expensive but we would all like to see you driving
that bus for years to come . :-)
