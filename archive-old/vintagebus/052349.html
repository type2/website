&gt;&gt;trying to see how to remove
the pin holding the swing lever in place. Is it nessesary to drop the
front beam for this, or is there a &quot;cheat&quot; of some way&lt;&lt;

David,
I did this repair on my old '66 with the beam ON. It took a little flexibility, busted knuckles, and a few &quot;colorful&quot; expressions, but all in all it was easy enough.  I used Muirs technique of hammering it upward using a socket just bigger tahn the bushings but just smaller than the opening where they go.  The hardcores will probably say this is not a good idea, but it worked for me!
