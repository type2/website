Well, I loaded the family into the bus and headed up to the top of the
hill (&quot;mountain&quot; to those E. of the Mississippi) behind my house.  It's
about a mile or so to where the street goes into the next valley.  We
walked another quarter mile to the top and waited for darkness.  

After darkness fell, we were treated to four professional fireworks
displays (Stevenson Ranch, Valencia Town Center, Castaic Lake, and Magic
Mountain) and an entire city's worth of illegal munitions, all from the
same vantage point.  

After the display was over, we loaded back into the bus and drove back
home.  Remarkably, nothing fell off or broke during the grueling 2-mile
drive.  Temperatures were in the high 80's but this was quite comfy
compared to midday temps.

Happy Independence Day (or whatever you're celebrating today!)

George Lyle
