I use Castrol too. I use different viscosity depending on the time of year.

There are two paper gaskets. One goes on top; the other goes on the bottom of the screen, sandwiching it. Then you slide it up into the engine and put the backing plate on. Torque the nuts onto the plate at 7 ft/lbs. Yes, SEVEN. If you tighten these too tight, you'll pull the studs right out of the case...also, when the engine heats up, the metal will expand, creating a much higher torque than 7 ft/lbs. An even torquing and a clean cover plate (and clean case where the gasket meets the engine) are your best bets for getting a good seal. I *do* put oil on the gaskets, but some volks don't. I wouldn't recommend gasket sealer there because it's a real pain to clean off.

Take care! Joe
