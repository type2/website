Subject: Re: [VB] Compression ratios on SP engine 

I re-measured the deck heights tonight. I also lined up the stock muffler
and SP intake. I can not shim more than .020&quot; on each side and feel
comfortable with the fit.

This what I have: ( Numbers approximate)

No shims:  8:1
with shims 0.020   = 7.6:1
no shims and carve 4.75 cc from the head chamber = 7.5:1
.010 shims and carve 3.25 from the chamber = 7.5:1
no shims carve 9cc from the chamber = 7:1
.020 shims and carve 6.25cc from the head  = 7:1

Can anyone give me a short course on where and how to hand remove material
from the head?I would like to hit on a happy medium.
