Subject: Re: [VB] screwed by the al crapcase again

&gt;Hi Craig,
&gt;What is your crankshaft diameter measuring at #2 bearing  surface?

54.73mm, which is actually the low end for spec on a crank cut .25. 
it was 54.75 last time  i assembled the motor, which makes sense as 
both  running wear and a polish by the local shop should have brought 
it down just a tad.

i'll round up a BB tonight.  as for honing it as a last resort, i 
gotta say there ARE no last resorts on this case. a part of me has NO 
problem if the thing grenades. can finally trash it. unfortunately, 
it also means getting out of vws, as we can't afford a new case, and 
the hoa  here frowns on immobile vehicles.

i'll let you know what the measurements are as soon as i can get to it.
