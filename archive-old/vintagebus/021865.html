&gt;The &quot;Amazing Yard Engine&quot; just got back from being rebuilt. For those that
don't know, this engine is one that Dave Easterwood more or less found in
his yard, and I proceeded to put 25000 miles on it without any trouble. &lt;

I think every time Dave cleans his yard he finds a new bus, engine, and/or
dead squirrel somehow ;)  

&gt;It's about the oil filter mount. Does anybody have a place they like to
mount theirs? I don't know how generic these are, mine is in a &quot;Bugpack&quot;
package. &lt;
I am assuming this is like all the others I have seen with two oil inlet
holes in the top and then a 90 degree plate with three holes for mounting on
it.  First you will need to get two 90 degree brass fittings because the
straight up fittings do not work so well in tight spots.  Plus you will want
to mount the filter upright instead of on its side so you do not make a mess
every time you change the filter.  I would fabricate a hanger off the left
bumper mount this will make it high enough not to get knocked off yet is
easy to access for oil changes.

Hope this helps,
