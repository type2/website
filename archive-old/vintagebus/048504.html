Subject: Those Happy/Sad Feelings

I have been down sizeing the inventory of busses lately.  I really hate to
let any go, but being a single parent, I know I won't have the time that is
needed to get all these busses back on the road.  Letting a bus just sit
isn't fair to the bus, or the people who would like to enjoy the feeling of
owning and driving a bus.  I have been very careful who I sell my &quot;bus
children&quot; to, but even so, it is always hard to see one leave the farm.

But just last night, I recieved a Christmas card from one of the new bus
owners.  On the front of the card was a beautiful picture of the adopted
bus in full Christmas light splender!  What a beautiful picture and the bus
really looked like it was enjoying the decoration.  It is really nice to
see that one of the vehicles you have enjoyed taking care of for so many
years is in the hands of someone who will love that bus even more than you
did.  But it still brings a lump to your throat.
