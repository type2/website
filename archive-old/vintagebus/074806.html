Subject: Re: [VB] Driving my Double Cab

&gt;&gt; Have you tried cramming a the wife, 7 year old and a car seat with a 2yr
&gt;&gt; old in the single cab on a quick trip to Lowes to pick up 800lbs of cement???
&gt; 
&gt; The single cab sure would give me a good excuse to leave the wife,
&gt; girl, and baby at home. The boy gets to come. He doesn't ask a bunch
&gt; of questions and want to look at blinds.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I've been married too long!


Boy Rex, I hope you've got your gender bias flame suit on!!  grin


Tom Buese-might have have had those thoughts, but never would have admitted
it &amp; been married 25 yrs!!!
