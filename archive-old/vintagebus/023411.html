&lt;&lt; Checked out the throttle ring at different rpms while revving the engine in
my driveway and it is not rubbing on the fan or anything.  Is this normal?  It
seems the change in the shape of the intake area of air has produced a
different sound from the engine.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everret,
Are you sure it is not rubbing.  We had the same problem with our 1958 sunroof
bug and had to adjust the ring a little farther back to keep it from rubbing
on the fan.

&lt;&lt;Also, it seems that the throttle ring would cause the engine to suck in less
air.&gt;&gt;
Kind of sounds like the battle wether or not to install the thermo flaps
system in the fresh air VWs to us.  If you are planning to run it at stock
RPMs it should be fine.  Still it would be very interesting to hear what you
find out with tach, oil temp and outside temp.

&lt;&lt;  I know this is the reason many people take them off and undoubtedly why
mine was missing in the first place but I'm wondering if I should remove just
the ring during the Arizona summers, when it's 90 at 7 am in the morning and
110-120 during the day.  I'm sure I'll get an earful but did Volkswagen
account for extreme temperatures such as those?  I do plan to stick a temp.
gauge on there when it starts getting hot, just to see what's up.&gt;&gt;
If cooling turns out to be a problem you might want to investigate how wide
and how many blades are in the cooling fan you are using now.  Check what
should have been stock to see if you need to get a wider fan with more blades.
Also you might want to consider using a Porshe oil cooler from the 1950-60s
that has that waffle look to it.  Fits right inside and provides more cooling
area.  There were also bigger lower pulleys used on the 25 HP engines, but
that would visible.  Eric &amp; Barb
