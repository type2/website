Subject: Re: [VB] S.E.S. Fuel Injector

John D. wrote &quot;....Anyone ever here of the S.E.S. Fuel Injector.  It attached
between the fuel
pump and the Carb I think - it had a solenoid and 'Velocity Stack' - with a
switch that went on the dash - a guy tells me he had this on his 72 beetle
and it would double the HP.  Should I give him the $25.00 he asking?......&quot;

I think this is the same guy who sells the little white pills you drop in your
gas tank that results in getting 100 MPG
