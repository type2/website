&gt;Anyone got any deluxe skylight window glass? I'm gonna need a total of (4).
&gt;Looking for any. pmail me with prices. Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;p.s. Who repro's this glass? Anyone?


Rex,

Be sure that you are matching the tint in your windows.  It seems there
were many tint options, or at least maybe different years had different
tints.

I don't think anyone is repoducing this glass, but you might be able to
form some plexeglass (sp?), it is very easy to bend with just a little
heat.  Cut out the shape you want, find something with the correct curve
(maybe even an old piece of glass).  Put the plastic in the oven at 350 on
a flat cookie sheet with some tin foil on top.

Wait a few minutes (maybe 5), use an oven mit, or some gloves and feel if
the edge is getting soft.  When you can bend up an edge, or corner, take
the plastic out and form over your mold.  Hold the plastic in place until
it cools.  If you don't get what you want the first time, reheat the
plastic and do it again.  Unless you tell, no one will ever know it's
plastic.
