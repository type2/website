Subject: Re: [VB] South-West area camper warning

The ABC just had its anual Christmas Party/campout this past weekend at White 
Tank Regional Park, which is a desert - mountain park near Phoenix.  I don't 
know about wolves, but the coyotes were very plentiful and very bold.  So 
bold as to allow themselves to not only be heard at night, but seen during 
the day, coming right up near the ramadas and in the parking area!  You could 
almost hear them thinking to themselves: &quot;Hurry up and go away so we can 
clean up your left-overs.&quot;
