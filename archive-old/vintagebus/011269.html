Hey all,

I just wanted to put my .02 in here. I placed an order with JBugs/Cal Pacific
about 2 weeks ago. I had been wondering of late, where my order had gone so I
gave them  a ring. The salesperson on the phone couldn't find anything and
offered to call me back when he found something out - I said &quot;no prob&quot;, gave
him my number and hung up. I really don't need the stuff as it's winter here
in Michigan and I can't really do much until spring but I still wondered where
my stuff and my credit card number had gone. About an hour later the
salesperson called back, my order had never been processed and my card had
never been debited. I wasn't that po'd I just wanted my order processed. He
said that they were going to 2nd day air my order and give a better gauge than
I had ordered just for the foul up. Now mind you, I hadn't ranted and raved or
anything -- they just admitted dropping the ball and wanted to make up for it.
Again, I live in Michigan -- there aren't a lot of high performance places to
get stuff around here so I have to deal mail order and in all the years I've
been doing this, this has been one of the more pleasant experiences. 2 gold
stars to cal pacific/j bugs.
I figured that after all the bad press lately, &quot;some&quot; vendors needed some
pumping up.

Later, Dan
