if you have exhaust in your heat then either you rmuffler (most likely) or 
you heaters boxes, or both have leaks. Since you have a deluxe, you can see 
if the rear heat smell different than the front, as each comes from a diff 
side, if one is dirty and the other clean, it is probably the heater box on 
the dirty side.   (if you look underneath you see which heater box heats the 
front and whi the back)

the tubes from engine to body can not cause bad exhaust smell.    The spittys 
came with a metal pod, then a metal tube to the heater box hat was wrapped 
with insulation.  The pod dampens noise from the engine, so you dont hear it 
as much with the heat on.

when I put a new muffler on my bug (the old one stank up the heat after 6 or 
7 years - pretty good for a $20 Brasilian cheap POS)   the old muffler had 
broken INSIDE, and  the exhaust/fresh air barrier had been crossed.  That's 
the deal when the heat smells.    You could hear stuff rattle around and then 
I took  one piece  that would bolt to the head and pulled it out of the 
muffler.
