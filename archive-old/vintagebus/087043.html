Subject: going to CA for an extended period

Hi guys,

I am going to be moving to California for an extended period of time for
work. The job is allowing me some money towards a rental car for my time
there. I was thinking of putting that money towards a VW (although a Ghia
not a bus).  

I am trying to figure out what would be involved in getting a car in CA. I
imagine I need to get a CA license? I would need to register the car in CA,
and also get insurance there. Does anyone have any suggestions/comments on
this idea? What does the state require when buying a vehicle there? What are
the general costs for this sort of thing-or where do I find these costs? I
have heard about the smog test-does this apply to old VW's? Is there an age
limit on this test?

I am very interested in a Ghia in McKinleyville, California. Any chance
anyone lives near there, and would like to do a pre-check for me? This could
save me about 12 hours driving for something that isn't worth it. I am going
to the San Jose area, and Mckinleyville is about 6 hours away from where
I'll be.

Any suggestions ideas welcome...

T2 content---this will save me from shipping my bus across country. ;)
