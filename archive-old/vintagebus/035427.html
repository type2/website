 1) rear camber. Wheels point in at top visibly. I assume this is spring
 plate adjustment? Might also be the wrong bearing covers the DPO used,
 getting to that real soon. No I am not driving her, wish I was/could. Rear
 config is Type II 68 trans, with stock wheels 195s and adapters. Type II
 brakes.

They normally do change with the amount of weight you have or dont have in 
the vehicle.  Re=ad the front bit in the idiot book for cool pictures and 
explanation.  
=============

 2) Front axle, the trailing arms of the tubes appear rubbed at front by the
 nuts. Is intense toe in at each side a possibility? the tires are 14 195s on
 stock rims. Is this rubbing a issue with lowered spindles? I havne't pulled
 front tires yet, taking some vacation to play with her soon. The brake hose
 bracket appears to be tie wrapped to the steering arm on the spindle.....I
 am assuming this is not correct for the lowered spindles.
 Any help is appreciated....

somethings funky in the steering.  I have that on the left side of my 65, 
with stock steering.   But I also have something bent, as it veers to the 
right since I replaced the wonky spindle with a non wonky one.
