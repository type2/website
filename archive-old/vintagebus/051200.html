Subject: road trip planning 

well...
my wife and i are planning the mother of all road trips in our bus. we found 
a pretty nice book about 6 months ago and have been flipping through the 
pages when we feel the travel bug :) really bad. check out the web site and 
see what you think-www.roadtripusa_dot_com-
we are in chicago right now, but are heading home to seattle for the summer. 
we took highway 2 -the &quot;great noethern&quot; highway out here last august-two 
lanes all the way-it was beautiful! after traveling a bit on major 
interstates in our bus -we have decided that the two lane old highways are 
the only way to go-so we are thinking about heading up to maine-then going 
down the east coast before we start heading west. has anyone taken route 66 
lately? we are seriously considering paying tribute the old American 
highway. then going north up the pacific coast to seattle-alot of miles, but 
we have some time and a little money-dreams at this point, but thats what 
gets us through the winter here in the midwest. check out the book if you 
want some road trip information-&quot;Road Trip USA&quot;-by Jamie Jensen. it has 11 
classic roads of American in it-highlights-sights to see along the 
way-mileage-all old two lane highways. it's on amazon for 17 bucks.
well have fun dreaming-now if i could only get me bus started! :)
