Subject: RE: [VB] Buckin' Bus!

Eric have you plugged the hole in the throttle plate of the 34 pict 3?  Very
hard to time with a 009 distributor without doing this.  Go to:
www.bostonengine_dot_com
then click on articles and then &quot;009 hesitation blues&quot;.  Good luck.

Any advice on my gummy 34pict3?  I was told the screw on the side below the 
choke cover can be blowed out w/ compressed air.  This carb has never liked 
to idle!  If that screw hole is clogged will that make the bus jump?  I 
don't want to rebuild the carb as of yet.  Can I soak it w/o damaging the 
seals?  I'm tried carb cleaner in a can, no fix!  Any carb ideas are grately

appreciated, as is any other spark/fuel trouble shoots.  I know if the gen 
ground on the shroud comes off it runs similar.  Could I have a grounded out

wire causing all this?  Voltage regulator?  Been driving like this for 500 
miles w/ lights sometimes and the battery is golden!
