Subject: Dis. drive shims, oil pres. pistons, and main bearings
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 1998 14:03:07 -0500

I'm finally putting my engine back together for my 58.  I though I'd get
the short block done yesterday, but ran into 2 snags and need some
guidance.

1.)  When I measure the play on my distributor drive gear with the 2
shims installed, I find .060&quot;.  My book indicates the play should be
between .020 and .050&quot;.  So do I need to add another shim?  If so, where
can I get one?

2.)  When I removed my oil pressure piston and oil control valve piston
(dual relief case from a 74 bug), I discovered much to my surprise that
the motor had a control valve piston where the relief valve should have
been (so I'm missing the one with the notch in it that goes with the big
spring).  My VW FLAPS only sells a Bugpack kit that comes with both
pistons and 2 heavy duty springs that are supposed to raise you oil
pressure.  I bought it cause it was cheap and they said that was the
only way to get the piston.  So, should I install the HD springs or stay
with the stock ones?  (1776 motor with full flow filtration)

3.)  When test-fitting my new main bearings (Mahle-made-in Mexico), I
found that the big round bearing that goes on the flywheel end of the
crank doesn't fit properly in the case.  You know how it goes onto the
case like a saddle fits on a horse?  Well, mine has about 1/8&quot; play from
front-to-back (like the horse is too skinny for the saddle).  All the
others fit fine.  Is this normal or do I have a big problem here???

Thanks in advance!
