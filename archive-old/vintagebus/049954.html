Subject: Pandora Update...


It looks like the deal is made, the Pandora bus will be Chip Shaner's 1964
Westy. Well, he says it's a Westy but in the windows it looks a lot like
Josh Rodger's Sundial, no jalousies, mini-gutters, we shall see but I think
Josh can eyeball this thing from 100 yards. Is this a Westy really?

Accounting to the donors, they deserve it: nose munched by some sort of
pole but it's not that bad and a replacement panel is included along with
smooth bumpers. We'll stitch the nose in with Joe's MIG and a cargo door
sill too. Otherwise very straight. Good trans, good engine recently built
and well balanced. IT RUNS WELL. Horrible horrible dual exhaust. I have
some loose flanges sitting around, how is that stainless muffler deal
going, Ron?!

Not pretty, needs Krylon, but solid and sound and in my judgement this is
the bus you were looking for. It has the additional advantage of keeping
both the bus and the money &quot;in the family&quot;, as it were. Although this will
leave Chip with no VWs but a waterboxer and I hope he doesn't sign
off--he's been here a long time.

Lots of people looked for buses for me and made suggestions and I want to
thank all of you. This bus will be named &quot;Pandora&quot;, it was not named
previously, I checked.

Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
