In a message dated 98-08-10 12:58:51 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; sounds like you are using calender years, not modell years.   Yes, bay
windows were made in 67, but it was 68 model.  Yes, most 64 models have push
button handles, but the first few months of 64 production have the pull kind.
I would bump most of this up a year to fit model year. &gt;&gt;

Thanks Clara, You are making an excellent point. I will elaborate on it for
the benefit of listees who are newer to VW. Volkswagen had a (very practical
and somewhat frustrating for collectors) habit of cleaning out the last model
years part bin before making changes to the vehicle. This explains the fact
that early 64s have pull handles (cleaning out the parts bin) and later 64s
have push buttons -- the announced new feature for the model year. Because of
this I was using a convention of  what Calendar year I believe that VW first
started using a feature on the production line. Clara pointed out that just
because a vehicle was made in a certain calendar year does not mean that it
was the same model year. I know, I know it is all very confusing! That is why
this is a hobby, why we have a list, and why we need to respect people like
Bob Hoover. I would like to suggest that the individual who originally posted
this question check out some books written by a man named Laurence Meredith.
One of my favorites is &quot;Original VW Bus&quot;. To get information on your specific
vehicle look for you M codes. On a bus they are located on the dividing wall
beteen the cockpit and the cargo area, I have no idea where they are on a
Double door. M codes you will probably hear people talk about on the list.
They were codes that were used by Volkswagen to describe the specific options
that were installed in a particular vehicle. Good Luck and enjoy your VW
