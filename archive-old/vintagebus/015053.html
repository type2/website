So I finally got to drive the '60 Microbus around today for the first
time in a month.  Said month was consumed with torquing the engine,
replacing various bits (voltage regulator, fuel line, new plug wires,
the usual stuff), and being sick (hence the excessive amount of time
involved).

In any case, on the drive home from work today, I noticed a couple of
times where I'd try to rev the engine from at or near idle, and would
get some missing and a fairly strong gas smell via the heater.  Going
by available power (sudden surges, etc), I'd guess that one cylinder
was missing/flooding out, as it'd settle down after 20-30 seconds at
higher revs.

Now, I can handle that one cylinder's slightly off on valve adjustment
or has a loose plug wire or whatever, but why am I getting the gas
odor?  This *is* a stale-air-heat bus, but wouldn't the unburned fuel
go out the exhaust manifolds, rather than get pulled into the internal
air stream?
