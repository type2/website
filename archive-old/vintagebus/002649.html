I have seen pics of a 50s Beetle with a 547 engine in it.  Apparently, the
owner was a Porsche mech. years ago, and ordered a complete new 547.  The
only outer appearance difference is the center exhaust outlet, and two small
bulges on the body to clear the carbs, I believe.  Yes, cams can take 12
hours or more!  I think even ign. timing is tough as well!


Also reminds me of the time I was walking in downtown milwaukee (15 years
ago) and saw a ratty 550 parked on the street!
