&gt; Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
&gt; have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
&gt; because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
&gt; were to pick up some chains at a garage sale what are
&gt; the chances that they will fit my 205/70/15's ? Do
&gt; chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
&gt; And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
&gt; unshiney orig paint on my kombi? Anyone else planning
&gt; on going, I know the only list member that went last
&gt; year was Gene, and he is not currently on the list.

Most chains come in a bag or box that has a list of tire sizes printed on
it.  The proof of the pudding is whether it fits or not in your driveway!

I say driveway becuase this is the first plsce you should try them.  Don't
leave it to when you are trying to mount them in a blizzard with wet slush
tricking down your arms and onto your pants!

If you really want to do it right, get an extra spare tire and carry the
chains already mounted on the spares.  It's a lot easier to swap wheels
than it is to put chains on.

Many folks prefer cable chains to &quot;real&quot; chains.  They run a lot smoother
but don't bite quite as well.

Being really prepared for snow is the best way to make sure that it won't
snow!
