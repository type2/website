Subject: Re: [T2] Thermal Electric Bus????

Rick,

Read the ad copy word for word....

Looked at one yesterday the size of a 6 pack.

It *didn't* say it would cool it down, but only that it would &quot;keep&quot;
it cool.  Big difference to me!.

Usually they use peletier transducers...big battery draw.

Check the amperage required before buying.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The 'fridge went out in my Scamp and I've been looking at these thermal
&gt; electric coolers and wondering how they work?  I'm sure someone on this list
&gt; can explain it in terms even I can understand.
&gt; 
&gt; Next question, I know these new 12volt coolers don't take as much energy to
&gt; cool as a 'fridge with compressor and coolant, so would it be possible to
&gt; put together a large enough unit so that with a solar panel, the bus could
&gt; be kept cool during the day with the sun shinning?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure the windows would have to be blocked to keep out as much heat as
&gt; possible, but it sure would be nice to keep the bus cool with the power of
&gt; the sun.
&gt; 
&gt; Just thinking outloud, tell me I'm crazy, everyone else does!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info.
