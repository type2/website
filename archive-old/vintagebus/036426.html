I went to VW's on the green in Littleton Co. with Barry, JP, Angela. My bus 
ran excellent. cool dip stick the whole trip, Mucho power on demand. 1776 SP, 
new case, stock heads, engle 100, petronix and dual Kadrons and intakes from 
Ronnie &quot;oldvolks&quot;
The show and camp out was real nice, super nice people, like JP said too many 
Beetles and not enough busses, I Met Carol, owner of Sewfine, Carol and her 
staff are real damn nice people and helped me out a lot. Dan the pres. of 
VWEC was also super helpful and nice.  
The weather was 75 and sunny, I was leaving the show at 4pm to catch up with 
JP and Barry. I encountered what I call a tornado like storm with 60-70+ mph 
twister winds with large flying debris like Boards, branches, dirt and 
airborne rocks. I was weaving to avoid the large debris trying to make it to 
an underpass (Like the movie twister) then the passenger side windshield 
exploded, big boom from pressure change, almost lost control of the High 
roof, thought I was going to be picked up and tossed upside down. The 
European windshields are not laminated so when they break they bust into a 
million pieces. I had glass in my eyes, ears, mouth all over the inside of 
the bus, trying to keep her steady was a real job at this point. I headed 
north to Arvada were my son lives and it started to pour freezing rain and 
snow into the bus. temperature went from 75 to freezing in half an hour. I'm 
glad my daughter Joanna didn't go on this trip because she would have been 
sitting in the passenger seat at the time.
I stayed in Arvada that night and woke up to 6+ inches of snow on the HR. I 
couldn't find glass or a seal anywhere in Denver area so I taped clear 
plastic (thanks to the people at Sewfine) to the opening and set the Speedo 
to 115 km/h, and got back to Albuquerque in 7 hours. My Bosch fluted lenses, 
fog lights and driver windshield are pitted and cracked as well.
I'll be installing US spec windshields. I can't find seals anywhere.
If you have euro spec windshields change them now! 
So that's my &quot;hard luck&quot; show report.
Kerry
