On behalf of the Arizona Bus Club and its members, I would like to send out
our thoughts and prayers for Josh and his family.  Several ABC members new
him.  Unfortunately, I only knew him through the list.  Tonight, (Wednesday)
is the ABC's Christmas party, but we will stop and think of him and have a
beer for him (I understand he had a beer once in a while) in honor of all he
did for bus lovers.  If there is anything the ABC can do, please let us know.

Jon Stanton, President
Arizona Bus Club
