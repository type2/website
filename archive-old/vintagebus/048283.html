was writ:

Cooling a Type2 is like cooling a tin shed. I've done some work on an idea
that cooling the entire interior is a waste of entropy-management when only
the occupants are uncomfortable. Wrap your hand around a big glass of iced
tea, feel cooler? I cobbled together a prototype a few years ago, but was
impractical for my short trips. Hope a dual system running for the Classic
weekend to use on the 200 mile trip down and show everyone at OCTO.

uses yor vent windows I say, have the over head air vent working, pop a 
couple pop outs, and if it is over 100 F keep the safaris closed and have a 
misting bottle handy, and a cold can of pop.
