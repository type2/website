I don't know about on the SC/DC cabs, but it's a PITA to change
generator in situ. When I do mine, the motor is getting yanked, might as
well check it all out like head torque and clean her up all happy.
There are some archive directions on doing in place, but difficult to
tighten the generator fan nut, I hear, never tried it on the ghia or
bus. Pulled the motor on the ghia to do it.
Sorry,
Al

Subject: [VB] Remove the engine???????????????


Hi All,

I've diagnosed my tipper electrical problems to a faulty generator. So,
I opened up the shop manual (the red and gray one since I have yet to
locate an original VW workshop manual that covers the 67) and the first
line I read is &quot;Remove Engine&quot;.

Is this true?  Last night, I started in on this project and quickly
realized after I had removed the carb, taken the bolts/nuts off of the
intake manifold, generator pedestal, etc that I still couldn't remove
the generator.  Maybe Muir is right in saying &quot;watch how it gets more
difficult as the years go by&quot;.

Thoughts?  Is this the straw that forces me to just pull the motor and
replace it with a correct 1500 h-case AR motor?



David
