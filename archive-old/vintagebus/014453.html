&lt;&lt; im also curious on that subject. im restoring my 53 and found 241 stamped 
on 
 my original driver door on the hinge and also on the frame top. my model is 
 deluxe and if not mistaken is 241 model. i had to get replacement passenger 
 door but has no sign  of stampings.??? &gt;&gt;

My '59 356A (for sale by the way) has &quot;748&quot; stamped into the hood hinge 
mounting area.  This number corresponds to the last three digits of the 
serial number.  Same way on all 356's I understand.  This is how the 
Porschefile's check for 100% originality.  Any chance your hinge stamp 
correlates to the serial number?
