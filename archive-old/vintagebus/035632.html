Let me preface this with the statement that this is NOT IN ANY WAY a personal
attack.  I  just have a few questions.  Please BOB don't take this the wrong
way.

&lt;&lt; I downloaded all of the technical ones.  Quite a long process.  They are
  now nicely compiled in a single zipped document if anyone would like a
  copy.  I assume they are free for non commercial distribution since they
  are posted on the web site. &gt;&gt;

 The natural outcome of this abuse has been to squelch such information, not
 just from me but from other experienced mechanics.

The way I see it.  A VW enthusiast with a lot of knowledge allowed his words
to be put on the internet &quot;freely, without thought of reward&quot;.  for the WORLD
to see.  Then another VW enthusiast who fouind the information usefull
compacted the information ( I assume in the exact format and with the proper
source included) for easier download for other VW enthusiast. (who already
have access to this material for free.)  This person was not charging for his
time or service but did this as a convenience.  My question is this.  How does
this act of kindness constitute &quot;an act of theft&quot;.  Secondly, how does such an
act have a &quot;natural outcome of this abuse has been to squelch such
information&quot;.  Again Bob, please take no offense.  I just don't see the logic
in this.  Please explain.

Steve
