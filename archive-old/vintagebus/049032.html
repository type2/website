Thom,
   How about monochrome tones, black, greys, white. It'll look like a rolling, old time, b&amp;w photo. Maybe sepia tones? Fuzzy paint? You've got that scan of commercial vans I sent. The Schammler-Schatz Brekina set #2 booklet has a bunch of commercial toys and photos. 
  The Speedwell van has an aged look, must have shot the lettering through a screen. 

I picked up a pair of shiny dual port heads from a LSSSY-YPABTGI (local self serve salvage yard you pay a buck to get into). Upon inspection they're stamped GEX and have signs of welding. Junk or serviceable? They don't have many miles on them, shiny all around.
