Subject: Dual Carbs/Stock Exhaust: Update

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question; I went ahead and
installed the stock Leistritz single tip on my 1776 along with new
heater boxes yesterday. I couldn't believe how nice it all went on, I
was practically weeping; the heat riser threads didn't require tapping
like those crappy brazilian jobbies. I used some of that Eastwood paint
on the muffler and plumbing, didn't care much for the brush marks it
made.

Well the muffler exceeded my expectations, I thought it would choke the
engine to a crawl, but it really runs great with better back pressure
than the extractor provided. I can take the engine up to 4,000 rpm with
no problems. ( my cruising rpms are around 3,200 - 3,600 ). Now from the
rear all you can see is a small exhaust tip and an orange oil filter.

My heat works better, too.

Ev
I guess it's true. Sooner or later you go back to stock.
