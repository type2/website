crazy question will any size motor fit in a 60 single cab some one tried to 
tell me that a late model beetle motor would not clear the engine tray that 
has to be bolted in as well as the existing engine compartment metal is in 
the way to fit a 1600 dp
please tell me that i am right and i wont have to cut any thing and can put a 
1600 dp as planed?  thanks john

yes any upright motor from 25hp to late beetle motor will fit fit.   If you 
are using a 12V FW the trans bell hoousing will have to be ground a be so the 
FW will fit, if it hasn't before.     This is one of the wonderful things 
abot old VWs.   You can pull the motor from one car and pop it in another.
