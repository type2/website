Well, I originally wrote that it is a 1600DP.  Stock RGBs, tranny for the 65 model year bus.  His
tranny has seen better days, but his RGBs are still probably, in good shape. (No noted wear, or
sounds)  Also, he is more into keeping the 1600dp motor setup, because it's easy to replace (more
of them lying around than any other)  Intake, 32picts, heads, etc...

He has a sufficently high speed, but would like to see the same speed with a little lower RPM. 
More of what he's really looking for is to have more hill pulling ability.  He frequently slows to
25-30mph in 70mph zones, on highways and interstates.  Not that there is anything wrong with that,
or that doing that is beyond the norm!  The bus doesn't see daily driving, but this time of year
goes on a few good distances to shows, and on runs.

Contrary to what a few may have collected from my info, he has owned the bus for years, and none
of us are &quot;new&quot; to the world of VWs.  Matter of fact, his father has been doing VW repair for over
35 years, and now, he continues the business.  He's just never done anything like this before. 
It's hard to explain all of this over the email list, and even harder to understand, by just
reading it on the list!!  I do understand how I could have come off that way.  Used trannies,
RGBs, and more are, generally, no problem to obtain and, really, he's got more than enough of them
lying around to do whatever with.  Quite a stockpile over the years, you know?

I guess he really wanted for me to post this on here, to get a good idea of what the vehicle
actually runs like, after a changover.  We both figured that SOMEBODY on here had probably done
the changout, and could give us any indication of what troubles they ran into, or how they like
it.  Since the post and responses I've got, sofar?, I've been trying to still talk him into
keeping the RGBs.  Like I also had noted, he's just looking for something new to do, as we're
finishing up his wife's 66 Beetle...er, actually ,just waiting on me, since I'm as slow as next
year's Christmas.  Just a little more tinkering to monkey with.

Budget is $100 to infinite?  Instead of slowing to 25-30 on steep NE TN and NC slopes, he would
prefer to only slow to 45 or so.  Because of the (later model especially) beetle gearing, he was
hoping for just slipping into 3rd, any keeping the rpms in the mid to higher range, to keep the
motor's power band spooled up.  He's not interested in stop light hot-rodding, nor setting the
land speed record for a VW bus.  Just a little different gearing to make use of the power he
already has.

We REALLY do appreciate it,

&gt; No prob, hope it helps,
&gt; 
&gt; still a little confused by what you have (65 bus ya, but what is in it?) how 
&gt; it performs now, what change in performance you would like, and the budget 
&gt; involved (if lowthis does reduce options).
