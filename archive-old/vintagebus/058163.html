&gt; Did you do the repair with the part in place (using an electric hand drill) 
&gt; or remove the part and drill it out in a drill press?

Hi Thomas,
We often use a hand electric drill and is a must to have one with slow (500 
or less) RPMs doing this!

&gt;&gt; I'm not really in a position to remove the heads right now.  Any tips for 
a &gt; successful repair? &lt;&lt;

The redrilling of the holes by hand is the hard part.  Use extremely light to 
no pressure pushing the the drill bit into the material.  The drill bit is 
going to want to grab into the material especially since it is soft aluminum. 
 If the drill motor is strong enough and geared low enough it will either 
break the drill bit or give a good try to break your arms!  The hardest part 
is to get the holes straight and that depends highly on how good your hand 
eye coordination is and checking often at from two 90 degree points of view!  


&gt; Should I use locktight on the insert?

Not needed.  The Time-Sert inserts have a unformed final bottom interior 
thread.  When you install it on the inserting tool and seat it the inserting 
tool is driven though this unformed area of thread spreading the insert into 
place into a press fit.  So you have to form the threads inside the repaired 
part for the full length of the insert.  You could use locktight, but in 
exhaust areas of great heat we doubt the lock tight will survive long!  
SMOKING!
