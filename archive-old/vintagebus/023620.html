In a message dated 98-08-13 02:22:02 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I'm thinking of a weekly Friday post something like the Weakly Statz, but
 which is nothing but a clickable list of aircooled resources. &gt;&gt;

Being new to the list, I would like to remind my fellow newbies of  some
nettiquette.

1) Listen first, post second!
This probably would have avoided such boneheaded questions such as &quot;Who is Bob
Hoover&quot;

2)Secondly when you subscribe to the list, you are sent a very detailed e-mail
of what resources are available to list members and more importantly how to
walk your way through those resources like the archive, Sermons of Bob Hoover
(TM,copyrighted, all rights reserved). to answer questions, The email is sent
to you so that you will READ it.

Having said that I do agree that we are in a PUSH society, and that the weekly
resources posting would be a good idea. May I suggest however, that Fridays
are probably not the best day for this. Open discussion generally increases
the volume on Friday and Saturday and we know that tempers do flare during
some of these threads. How about Sundays for the weekly posting? Volume is
usually light on Sunday anyway.
