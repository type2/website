Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

another variable is compression ratio!
i  have 6.9:1 on my rebuild (roughly - it was my first time balancing
heads), and that sucker can get cranked to 35 degrees or so and NOT ping...
even when we put it in third and let in the clutch.
i usually run 90 pump gas.

now, i know berg says that ping starts before you hear it, so i don't run
it at that crazy  setting with a centrifugal dizzy, but i could. idle
timing was like 20! man, what a smooth idle :)


so three otherwise identical  motors - carbs, jets, advance dizzys and
intake manifolds - could all run different temps if they had varying CRs.
