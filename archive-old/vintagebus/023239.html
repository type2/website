First, validate that it *is* oil, and not brake fluid.  Is it on the
inboard side or outside?

Then get yourself a bentley manual for your car, or bum from one fromeone
else.

Parts-wise, the least you'll need is a new rear wheel seal and a reduction
box seal.   While you have everything torn apart, it'a a great time to
check your brakes and brake lines.

Are the RGB instructions out there on the NEATO site?

&gt;My left reduction box is covered in oil so i believe it has a bad gasget or
&gt;something. i have to take it apart but i have no manual, so i was wondering
&gt;if anyone had some experience in this matter. If you do, could you please
&gt;give me some directions and tell me what to watch out for.
