What does the preheat tube connect to?  Is it a &quot;J&quot; shaped thing right under
the tin?  If so, how does it bolt onto the car?

Another question - is the rear (FOF) tin for a '66 shared with beetles, i.e.
is the preheat hose hole on the right side as in the beetle (if it IS there on
the beetle)?

off hand I dont remeber exactly which years had the tube on which side.   In 
my 65 I have the tube o the right side as it is easier, but I have the 
feeling it originally was longer and wen to the left side and had a clip at 
the middle where the threade d hole in the rear tin is.     I have a 67 bug 
tin in my65 and blocked off the left preheat hole. 

The right preheat pick up is kinda J shaped, ya, and either screws to the tin 
with a tin screw or at the muffler, I think it is the latter with the upper 
13mm nut.    The left one is straight.  each side has the little under tin 
with a hole to fit teh pick up tube.   I think I have only seen right ones 
for the straight road draft tube (RDT) off the oil filler, the do not have 
the gap for the dogleg RDT.  

the top end of the tube sticks up through the hole in the tin (grommet for 
this are available new from WCM)  for the paper tibe to fit onto.  the bottom 
end sits close to the head to pick up hot air.
