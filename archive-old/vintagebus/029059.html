Subject: Solvang &amp; 51 Bus

Would love to drive the 51 bus to Solvang--But Magoo and i have some 5 cats and
a dog to take care of. We really cannot be away from the home any length of
time, as these &quot;friends&quot; of ours would be left unattended--The Solvang show is a
&quot;Must&quot; for anyone that can make it. Seeing as the 51 has not left Germany as of
yet--I have no idea as to the ETA of the 51--My thanks to Robert Davis, a fellow
listee, who will give me a big hand in receiving the 51 in California, Its great
to have friends that step up and help--But that is what this list is
for--thanks--TWWM, uj
