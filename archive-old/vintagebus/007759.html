Alright
Getting the clothes washed and the bag packed as NQ and I are going across
the great state of Nebraska to go to the Colorado shows this weekend.  Who
else is going and how will we be able to determine who is who.  NQ is a big
guy wearing overalls and I will be wearing a Omaha VW Club shirt so get in
touch with me now or at the show as I would like to meat some more of you.
Hope for rain Sat as RMMW gives out great deals when it looks like rain as
they pull all the sheet metal out into their yard and don't want to haul it
back in so give incredible deals.  Last year it was 2 heat exchangers (75-78
bus), monza type muffler for my 74 Type IV motor and a super beetle bra
($50)  Sold the exchangers on ebay for $200 and they paid for my trip
Again hope to meet some of you
