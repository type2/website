&lt;&lt; i finally got smart and ordered some vent wing latches for my bus (I should
 have ordered them in November before it got cold). does anyone know a
 procedure for installing these? do they need to be welded on or do you just
 kind of fit them on there? in case it matters, i got them from RMMW and they
 are the universal bug/bus kind in chrome. Thanks!

you have to take the vents wing glass out of the frame.  then see wher ethe 
old latch is riveted on?   carefully drill it out.  rivet new latch on.  
install vent wing glass.   

easier said than done, do look in you Bentley before doing this.  
reinstalling vent wing glass can be a pain.
