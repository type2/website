Subject: SC bed dilemma resolved!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I'm happy to report that the SC bed section is gone, and NOT to the
dump!  A guy from Stockton (about 1 hour south of Sacramento) picked it up
yesterday.  It's going to fix his '57 SC that someone did a hackjob of
converting into a sideloader.  It appears to be the perfect piece for his
needs.  Coincidentally, the free cargo floor piece I gave away recently is
going to New Jersey to fix the floor in Ronnie's ex-sideloader.  I am the
sideloader repair piece master!  I rule!  ;)

Thanks to all who expressed interest.
