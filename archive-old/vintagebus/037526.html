Questions:

I was recently given a Saphire IX  AM transistor radio. It says it was
built exclusively for VW distributors in the US. It has the number 8BV

1) Any idea what year bus, if any, this might have come in?
- - -  -
what colour are the push buttons?    Grey is i think 64-66, ivory 63 and
back.   Like they should match the buses dash knobs/shift knob.  Hm did they
come with black push buttons for commercials?
.....
2) Can someone help me with the wiring? It seems simple enough. I just need
to know which color is for what. It's got a black wire by itself with an
inline fuse (hot?), a black &amp; green wire together (speaker?), &amp; another
black wire next to those 2 (ground?). I just don't want to experiment &amp;
maybe fry something.
-  -- -
black is hot.  one is power o the radio, other power to the light in the
radio.  The light wire gets jumped with a piggyback type connector to the
speedo light blub holder on the radio side of the speedo so the radio light
comes on when the dash lights are on (nifty huh?)   there is a ground wire
(brown I expect) and a speaker wire that is the twinnned wire that looks like
speaker wire.  hope this helps.   I don't have one in front of me, so I might
have that wrong.
