Hi y'all. The Dor Fires but doesn't stay running.  I suspected that'd
happen when I looked at the carb.  It's a funky 2 barrel of a type I'm
not familiar with, though my friends Derek and Ben say it's either a
Weber or Holley progressive.  No name plate visible, but on the front
where it meets the manifold there are these #s
32/36DFAV    234A 1E

Anyone know who made it so I can get a kit?
Dave
