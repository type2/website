&lt;&lt; Doing that from a 12 volt vehicle just won't work (well, it'll probably 
start, but it'll also blow all the indicator lights).  I have my doubts 
regarding random jump-start services.  Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
We have done this without problem.  Though as always we have made sure the 
last jumper cable end attached is a ground somewhere away from the battery 
and when removing the cables this ground is removed first.  This prevents 
sparking over the battery and causing an explosion from the hydrogen fumes 
which recently run down batteries are full of!  
  Also have in a pinch installed a 12 volt battery in a 6 volt bus to get it 
home.  Just make sure to get the engine started ASAP and do not let the 
ignition key stay in the power position while the engine is not running for 
more than a minute.  We did this during daylight and only ran the signals 
(BRIGHT!) only as needed.  The generator light would flicker slightly while 
running, otherwise it ran fine the 50+ miles trip.   Eric&amp;Barb
