&lt;&lt;VolksWorld is where its at.
FLAT 4 was good althougth they just changed the name of it and can't remember.&gt;&gt;

FLAT 4 is now called Total VW. This magazine is getting better and better...

But VolksWorld RULES!!!

I used to read VW Trends, but I dont bother any more. All the stories is always going: &quot;First I towed it to ..... to get the body work done, and then to.....for paint prep. I dropped the bumpers off at.....&quot;  NO ONE is doing any thing themselves in that rag!  And that's what VW's is all about to me, enthusiasts fixing up old cars! Not &quot;the one with the most money wins&quot;!

VolksWorld is more &quot;hands on&quot; that way, with the occasional towing story :-)
