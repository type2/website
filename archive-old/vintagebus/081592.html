Subject: Re: [VB] Best line of the lot...

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; You guys have provided a great deal to think about, but the 
&gt; laugh-out-loud, best line of all was:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Second, you're driving a VW bus....News Flash...everybody IS making fun 
&gt; of
&gt; you already...&quot;


You're welcome :-)  How did the line re: the girlfriend go over?



&gt; Unfortunately, I don't think there are any VW swaps in Northern California 
&gt; coming up.  I may have to make a run to Pomona if one is scheduled.  Then 
&gt; there's the Porsche VW literature meet in Anahiem in January.
&gt;

I think there is an OCTO in Huntington Beach right around that time...I 
think it is the day after the lit. meet.  Don't miss it.

Steve
