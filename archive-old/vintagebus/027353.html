OK, been there done that.  I was taught most of my mechanics by a 74 P**g**t
wagon.  If you are at all mechanically inclined you can do it.  (hey I
convinced a gal at work she was capable and she pulled the radiator in her car,
much to her husbands disbelief.)  You will also need tools and some strength
and be willing to get dirty.  There are ways to help with the strength issues
like levers, pulleys, snipes, etc. but there is no way around the other two.
You need tools - the right tools - and you will get dirty.

First find yourself a good reliable VW parts store (FLAPS usually are not as
helpful with vw specific parts/problems).  Maybe someone on the list or AIRS
can help you out on that.

Second - pick up the Idiots guide.  It is the best one I have seen for layman
diagnosis and operations.  Take it to the garage and read it with your bus.
Get familiar with the terms, tools, and procedures.  If you have questions
while reading, write them down.  Read the whole front end section and anything
related that you do not understand.  Make sure you know what is safe to
disconnect before you do, and that you have all the needed tools before you
need them.  This is also a good time to decide if you are up to the task.

SAFETY is a big issue.  Cars on jacks are not stable, make sure your bus will
not fall on you (a mechanic friend was nearly crushed by a car 'safely on a
commercial lift') when you are working on it.  When you think you have it
secure, check it again and shake it just for good measure.  Throw extra tires
or anything big around under neath to give you some safety space if it should
fall off the stands.  You are better off not making it to Kelly park this year
than never making it.

Once you have the idea, the terminology, the question list (hopefully short),
the book, and the parts/grease/tools needed list,  head for that reliable parts
store.  Pick a time when they are not too busy and are more likely to have time
to discuss things.  If you can talk the lingo and are specific, most guys will
talk to you.  They want to sell the parts and are usually willing to do some
explaining.  Also good to set up a relationship if a part breaks and you need
something fast.  People identify better with a person they have met - get his
name.

Once you are into it, it helps to have someone else read the book, also good to
have someone around to hand those tools that are just out of reach and for
safety.   Try the list if you get stumped on something, the reasearch archives
have saved me a time or too.

Just take it one step at a time and you can do it.

&gt;  So my only alternative is to do it myself!!  I feel
&gt; pathetic being 22 years old and having 8 years of VW history under my belt
&gt; and totally lacking the knowledge of how to fix anything myself, not to
&gt; mention that I am a girl.  So would somebody...anybody offer me some advice
&gt; on how to get started and exactly what to do in order to fix my front
&gt; suspension!!!
&gt; Thanks,
