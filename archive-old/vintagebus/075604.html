Subject: What parts should I choose? 

Volks,

My friend is parting out a '67 bus and I've got first (and last) shot at
anything I need off of it: it's going to the crusher after I decide what I
want.
                                                                                
Luckily, my bus is pretty straight, so there's not much I need, but I'd
like to pick up anything that is &quot;hard to find&quot; while I have a chance.
Unfortunately, I'm working on limited funds and don't have a place for a
third bus, otherwise I'd just snatch it up.  From what I recall this parts
bus is in fairly reasonable shape (although not super) and is missing an
engine and tranny.
                                                                                
The main things I want off of it are the RGBs and the axle shafts.  Other
thoughts were the glass, door handles, steering box, and seats.  Is there
other stuff that I should be sure to grab? 

Thanks,
   Tom
