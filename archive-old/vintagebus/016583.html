Hey all,

Thanks for all the replys and help on the crusty shock.  I got burnt out 
last night but will try to hook up a torch or something tonight.  Drivin the 
GTi was nice today after over a month in the bus (still prefer comuting in 
the bus, but ocasional change is good)  Anyway this probably a dumb ? but do 
GRBs have seals?  I'm just getting to know my bus thats only 6 or 7 weeks 
old to me and haven't tore into one.  The passenger side wheel has always 
had stuff spewed all over it.  Wasn't sure if it was brake fluid from a 
falty wheel cylinder or a gear oil leak...pretty sure its the later.  I 
tightened the bolts on him the last time I fed the tranny Staylube but he 
still leaks...I'm not even sure if its leaking form the split in the GRB 
case.  Any ideas.

Eric
66deluxe w/ crusty shocks and leaky grb
