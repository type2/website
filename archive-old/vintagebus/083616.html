When you  say the neck I assume you are talking about the section that 
projects out from  the cover and then leads to the base of the oil  filter?



Hi Dan,
Correct!  The tilt angel is so slight.  That way the filter does  not try to 
take up the same space as the left heat riser tube coming out of the  front of 
the muffler.  Have heard there are stock type mufflers where this  heat riser 
tube comes out of the right front, but have not seen these.
