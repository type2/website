Subject: Eddie Van Halen Strikes Again...

I went into the local Wal-Mart parking lot tonight,
lookin for some Ol' Roy dog food and a couple bottles of diet pepsi,and damn
if the Van Halen tour bus wasn't pulled up to the front doors.

Eddie was inside scooping up all the VW Bus toys; man he had sambas with
trailers, and red and white deluxes, he had a fist full of hot wheels
and at least five or six matchbox splits shoved into his jeans pockets,
runnin around like a maniac,
friggen rock stars are gonna spoil it for the kids man.
I remember when that friggen Garth Brooks toured through here and bought up
all the John Deere toys.
People were PISSED man.
