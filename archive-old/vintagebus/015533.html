Ran into a fun one last night.  I had some some tweaking on the passenger
door, until it fit *perfectly* - it was a thing of beauty.  Until
I installed the window assembly last night.  Now it sags - badly.  It looks
like I'm going to have to do the welding trick like I did on the driver's
side.  Hint: do the tweaking with the window frame installed - that's
some significant weight :(  This passenger door has been nothing but
problems... (it's the same one with the bubbles)

In other news, I'm installing seals left and right.  Man that's a lotta
rubber!  I got my freshly painted locking column installed without
scratching it - hint: wrap it in masking paper - and the steering
column lock, etc installed.  Tom Mink came over Wed and did most of
the wiring work; just have the turn signals to debug and the
headlights and dome light to install.  He also &quot;restored&quot; my trip
speedo, cleaning up the glass and face, and installing new idiot light
colors.
