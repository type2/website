I believe the 67 middle seat is one year only.  The bottom of the seat frame has
diagonal bars welded into it on each of the legs.  The points where you clamp the
seat in have small holes drilled into them (like bay window middle seats) for the
clamps.  The clamp is different in that it has a knob to fit into these holes on
the seat frame.  The clamp plates are different as they are thinner and are
pressed steel I believe.
I recently sold a 2/3 '67 middle seat with clamps for $250....and the seat needed
recovering, or a blanket thrown over it....but the frame and clamps were very
nice.

&gt; Mine was out of a 67, had that *NASTY* original brown striped upholstry on it
&gt; still.
&gt; Might be a 66-67 only seat.
