&gt; Wait a sec...did Jim finally sell the Campulance?  Why didn't we get to
&gt; hear about it?  Or did we and did I just miss it?  I suppose
&gt; congratulations are in order as well as condolences.  Here's hoping we
&gt; never see it slammed with BRMs in some foreign mag someday!

What, you didn't know? Ellis slammed it himself and put Porsche phone dials
on it just to get it sold. All he did was pull all of the springs out of the
front beam and drop the back 4 notches. Snuck by all of the neighbors houses
in the dark and took their spacesaver spares to get some rubber on there. I
don't much care for slammed buses, but that old barndoor camper looked
pretty cool with the Brink hitch a quarter inch off of the ground. You
couldn't even see the neon tubes he put under it, so that was kind of a
waste. Of course they were kind of dim anyway, what with the 6v an all.
