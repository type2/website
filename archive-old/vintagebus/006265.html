Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Jerome

Just got home from my day in the salt mines, knocked out a couple more hours
on the raffle bus and then came in to read the list. Probably shouldn't
comment since I am but a lowly grunt, and not an exalted board person, but
I'm all bloated and bitchy so I will anyway. I know that everyone means to
help and that is great, but the vintagebus list is a completely
innapropriate place to decide what will be done with the proceeds from the
Jerome Jamboree. While there is no doubt that there are victims in serious
need on the East Coast, we have needy people local to us that will still be
in need after the new World Trade Center is standing with the bronzed
scrotums of the guilty terrorists mounted prominantly in a large spitoon in
the lobby.

The club always gives to worthy charities, and ones where the effects of the
donation can be verified. This years choices are equally valid. There are
not unlimited funds to give, if they are given to the New York victims, they
are taken from the Hacienda de Los Angeles (which benefits survivors of
childhood near drownings) or the Animal Benefits Club (a no-kill shelter
that does amazing work completely through donations and has great initials).
Easy enough to do in an internet discussion, but much harder to do in
person. While it would be very popular to give every dime to the &quot;concept&quot;
of helping the victims in New York, it would be a neat trick to figure out
how to actually do that. Just mailing a check is not necessarily helping.

We all like helping severely injured or abandoned kids and animals, and with
the charities selected we are sure we are doing just that. The negative
effect of removing our donation from them would surely be greater than any
possible positive effect of a few thousand dollars to the Red Cross. By all
means help your fellow citizens in the East. Give blood. Send money. Develop
an interesting fundraiser for them at Jerome and I will help you pull it
off, but you can't push aside the valid and worthwhile needs of the
charities already selected just because they didn't come into the national
consciousness in the last 24 hours. The board may or may not vote to help
back East, but you just shouldn't expect to show up at Jerome and see
everything going to the Red Cross just because you saw a couple of posts
about it on the internet. Jerome will be fun, the bus is nice, and the
charities are great. Hope to see you there!
