Subject: Sorry in Advance... type 1's


I have a quick question re Type 1's and it isn't worth going on another list 
to try and get an answer.  I need to replace the heater control cables and 
am uncertain about starting, just need starting points I can figure the 
rest... has the knob you turn rather than levers.  plz take this offlist and 
if it is after 12 PST then don't worry about it.

Thanks and sorry for going off topic but if you want content then... my 
son's 63 panel is almost on the road... just needs to finish up the 
temporary use motor.  We can hardly wait.
