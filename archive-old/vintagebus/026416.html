Yes   it does work!--even, uj--TWWM!  I set up a system many years ago
in my 70 Ghia--
My only problem was getting it to work at idle--You can actually build
one yourself--A container--valve--hose--breather tube---water---Its been
about 16 years since i put one together --but it did work--best of
luck--
PS--re regarding the 78 Bus on e-bay--&quot;Show Bus&quot;--hey its coach-built!
and a VW--how can it be ugly??  Although i can understand--I get a lot
of flack with my 63 VW Hearse--seems that's ugly as well--the last show
i was in--the judges said it was Not a real VW bus!! they could not
decide what class to put it in as they thought it was Not real--The
Frickinger Coach Built Badges on &quot;Drakula&quot; had no effect--still not a
real VW bus!--But &quot;Life&quot; does go on--Even in a Real VW Hearse!!!--TWWM,
uj
