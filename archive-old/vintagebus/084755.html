Subject: link pin zerk won't take grease

this can't be good, I haven't tried to remove the zerk and check to see if 
its clogged.  Do the zerks clog? Do I need new/rebuilt link pins?  The bus 
is a 56' and the only place I have seen that has them is Wolfsburg West 
but not in stock.. What are my options?  Friend of mine 
claims to have NOS ones but he &quot;will put them aside next time he runs in 
to them&quot; not holding my breath on that.. Many things on front end have 
been rebuilt but I doubt these have.
looked around the library for info on link pins but didn't find any

thanks
