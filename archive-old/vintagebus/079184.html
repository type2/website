Subject: interior for cheap!!

I have been trying to peddle this interior for a few months now. It's from a 78 Westy and I need to get rid of it. It is missing a few handles and the laminate is chipped here and there. It includes all the cabinets,rear seat(green yellow plaid),ice box sink. NO front seats.
I will take any offer over $50.00. Located in Mystic,CT.
