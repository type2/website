Subject: lowered busses

I`m interested in finding out what size tires and wheel combo that
anyone that has a lowered bus is using. I bought a 67 that was already
lowered.
When I have a decsent load up front my tires  hit the bottom of the bus when
we hit a bump.
Anybody have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Dave
