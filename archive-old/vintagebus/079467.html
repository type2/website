thanks guys you have described the problem correctly however  i think i 
screwed up the order in which the brake lines are supposed to be attached to the 
the mc and that is resulting in the &quot;fade&quot; that i describe- i drive too slow to 
really overheat the brakes&lt;&lt;
Hi Mheron,
Did you make sure to have the proper spacing between the MC piston and the 
pushrod?  Check section B-2, page 2 in the VW Transporter Workshp Manual.  If 
not the brake pressure will build up because the pressure relief valve/s do not 
get opened up.  With this happening even if you drive at only 5 MPH the brakes 
will overheat if you drive long enough!
&gt;&gt;btw can you please send me an article or advice on redoing the 
gearing/engine on the bus to get some more top end speed. right now my bus is running 
stock gearing a 1600 dp and seems hard pressed to go any faster that 60 mph- 
thanks again &lt;&lt;
Sure!  Will Pmail you and anyone else interested that info.
Eric&amp;Barb
