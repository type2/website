Renoir,

ITS in El Cajon is great.  They have rebuilt half the trannies of the SV2's
memebers and get raves from every one of them.  Pat helped me out with all new
bearings, stup axles, and gaskets and talked to me for hours about the
innerworkings, and what type of tranny i had and everything.  Strongly recommend
them.

Good luck,
Aaron

&gt; Hi all, renoir here.
&gt;
&gt; 75 tranny in a 71 bus.
&gt; On the way up to 5000' in third gear, i heard a &quot;ting&quot;, so i figured to slow
&gt; down to second
&gt; (i was going maybe 35 or 49mph). Could not shift to second, stopped and
&gt; shifted to first to get me off the freeway. Tranny was hot, first time ever.
&gt; I have taken many hard and long trips. After cooling drove a few miles and
&gt; could not shift into second. Stopped could not get it out of gear, then got
&gt; lucky and put it in neutral. Towed back to San Diego, thank god for triple
&gt; AAA.
&gt; Tow driver put it in first for stability. When we got home could not get it
&gt; out of gear to roll in driveway. Dropped motor. Now it goes in gears but not
&gt; fourth.
&gt;
&gt; Pulled tranny, clutch housing, and nose cone. It looks like it is missing
&gt; ball bearings in front, only about eight of them and the bearing cage is
&gt; gone.
&gt;
&gt; I hate going to a rebuilder but it seems i have no choice, do I?
&gt; When you take it to a rebuilder, you give them cash and then they say done,
&gt; you never know what is really going on for your dollars.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions are appreciated.
&gt; Renoir-a little depressed.
