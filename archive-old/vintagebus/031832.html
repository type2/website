Subject:  Kelley Park changes/RED BARN swap

For those looking for a good swap Kelly Park week-end come to the Red Barn
swap and show on the Saturday before KP. Most of the bus people who swap
will be there on Saturday allready and most of the good stuff will be gone
before it ever gets to Kelly Park. With all the confusion of what will and
won't be at Kelly Park, at this time I personally have elected to by-pass KP
to swap and maybe KP altogether and just go hang out in Santa Cruz on Sunday
and ride the roller coaster. I will not leave my bus in the parking lot to
go into Kelly Park and the way it looks they won't let my bus in, who knows
I might show up in my new Westy anyway and it will be far from SHOW quality.
But in reading the post it looks like there will be a swap at KP but where
and what does it take to get in is another question?.

ps. I will have my new repo fiberglass pressed bumpers, truck, standard,
front and rear at the Red Barn swap and a lot of other new goodies.

The swap thing is not a problem.  Have ALL the swap in the nice new parking
lot
out back.  Remember where ya all lined up last year?  It is the perfect
place.
Leave the park for the show and vendors.  Problem solved.  How many of you
bringing swap stuff are showing a bus anyway???
