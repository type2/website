Subject: headlight question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.0003091821150.21944-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


The other day I was driving my bus and all of a sudden the headlights went
out.  The first thing I did was check the fuses...they were good.  I then
checked if the taillights were working....they were.  I then started to
check every electrical component on the bus...everything works, except the
headlights of course.  If this has happened to anyone else out there or if
anyone has any pointers on how to fix it let me know.
