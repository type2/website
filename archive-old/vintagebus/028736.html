Well, you need to decide if you want a functional ice box or the correct
one. ;-)  If you are looking for the correct one, there is a slight
difference in the bench seat model and the walk through box.  Obviously the
bench seat model needs to have the back cut out slightly to accept the spare
tire bulge.  The correct water pump (plunger type) is VERY difficult to
find.  I have a '65 and have been looking off and on for about 3 years now.
I've only ever seen one in person.  It lives on the dark blue pop-top with
the early orange striped tent that lives in the PNW.

I've seen complete boxes go anywhere from $25 to  $250, just depends when
and where you find them.  I even had one given to me, but that is a rarity.
Ask the list.  I was trying to get one out of Phoenix, but the guy was a
flake.  Ask Matt and Katie.

If you want one that works really well, go down to Wally World and get
yourself the big blue one...I hear they're the bomb ;-)

Good luck.

Steve

&gt;     I'd like to find a few accessories for the old gal, such as a
&gt; sink/ice box unit, a jack, and a radio, working or not. We'll be moving
&gt; to Albuquerque in a couple of weeks with our yellow 72 bug as well. Any
&gt; pointers on parts
