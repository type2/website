Subject: NLA program? (was The Volkswagen Protest)

I think VWOA would have been better off leaving this stuff to the
aftermarket.  I'm sure there's tremendous costs associated with
bringing back old parts, and I can appreciate that, but the 
demographic they're targeting in notoriously cheap.   I can call up
Stoddard and order a fender for my pre-A coupe (part # 356.51.311)
and if I had a *pre-A* coupe, I'd be happy to shell out the $812
(http://www.stoddard_dot_com/specials.html)    Very few VW people are
going to pay that kind of money.

Also, assuming this program is more than a pipe dream, how will they
deal with the diversity of models?   What years?   Let's say they
match the years of VW's to the years of 356's (66 and earlier).  You
still have 2 model lines to cover (type 1 and type 2) and 2 major 
generations of the type2 for which there's a lot of non-interchangable
parts, and several different sub-models (pickup, panel, deluxe, etc)  
For the bugs of the same range, you have split, oval and big-window.

Most of the tooling to make the original parts went to Brazil, Mexico and ZA
when it was superceded in Germany, which is why you get the strange Brazilian
buses with 'barndoor' parts and corner windows.   The last of those
buses were made in what, the early 80's?   Same goes for the bugs, and 
those use the late 70's body panels - like there's a huge market for superbeetle
fenders...

So unless the parts were just generic mechanical stuff (ie fuel, ignition, etc)
and some accessory doo-dads (mudflaps, hubcaps), there's going to be
a lot of very difficult decisions to make.  

Some of the Porsche NLA program's biggest customers are the AR concours folx.
Apart from people like Dave Mayes, you just don't find that demographic
in the VW community.  VW shows seem to be about sitting around drinking beer
and ingesting other substances, not seeing whose car is more correct.
(*that* excercise seems to be reserved for Usenet and mailing list discussions)

The later-model stuff sold thru places like Stoddard isn't that old.
The last of the G-body cars were made in '89, and you can still get a lot
of rubber and mechanical pieces thru the dealer ($$$)

The point is - to mimic the NLA program that Porsche runs would be
a *huge* undertaking.  If VW was indeed involved in something of that
magnitude, *somebody* would know.

At this point, the NLA program is nothing more than 4th-hand hearsay and
conjecture, shrouded and obfuscated by NDA's and he-said/she-said.  The
lead-in of &quot; A few years ago one of my best friends other half was a designer for
VW and was in charge and the US decision maker for portions of new VW. I
can't really say more because of the confidentiality agreement  signed
at departure from VWoA.&quot;  is akin to something I'd read on snopes_dot_com

The 'sanitation' argument doesn't hold water in light of the fact that one
of the first things they went went after was hobbyist web sites.  And Porsche
is also on a similar campaign, even *with* the NLA program.

Maybe the &quot;NLA&quot; program is a smoke screen to quell the unrest in the VW
community.  It's a tried and true marketing tecnique, afterall - look
how Microsoft killed OS/2 with perpetual hints of Windows 4, without
having to actually produce it?

In conclusion, I'm not buying the NLA conspiracy theory.

Callin' 'em like I see 'em.
