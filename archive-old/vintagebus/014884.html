Check out these (exact same) ads for another view of
this bus. Thanks for the interest. I'm on the verge of
taking it off the market and just keeping the thing.
Maybe I will sell the dependable daily driver '63 EZ
camper. Both are very nice buses. Hell, at this point
I'll carve skylights into it or turn it into a clooged
Binz if that's what you want and will make you feel
better.
