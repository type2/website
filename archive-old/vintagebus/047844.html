In a message dated 98-11-11 23:20:41 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; It's obvious that one goops the glass channel first and install the seal
around the glass.  That's easy. How does one sequence the goop application in
with:
 
 String around the frame seal lip. Install to the outside window frame. Start
pulling on string to open up seal opening. Working seal to the inside of the
window frame.
 
 Seal it as I go?  I can envision getting goo to the inside frame area easily
enough, but can't quite figure out the outside edge application timing.
 
 I would think that improper sequencing would lead to a huge mess!
Any tips on how one may accomplish this solo? Kids too small, SO has chronic
weak shoulder/neck from excess quilting, so can't get help out here in the
boonies, and bus doesn't run yet to go elsewhere.  &gt;&gt;
  First make sure you use roofing tar that smells like asphalt and is black
oily looking.  Then using a condiment container you can buy from you local
supermarket with a pull off spout cover(Not the screw closed type of mustard
containers.  To apply the tar to the rubber channel that the glass inserts
into.  Then if there is no headliner material that touches the window frame
area, paint the frame with roofing tar.  When there is headliner or other
stuff then paint the lower and side sections of window frame.  Then using a
thick VW electrical wire, not the thickest, but one of the thicker(12 gauge?).
Instead of string.  If you helper has problems pushing then you wrap the wire
around the window and seal and end the wire on the bottom of the window tied
loosely.  Drop wire ends into the interior of bus while getting window and
glass into body frame.  Then carefully push with hands spread wide gently but
firmly while moving all around the window till the window and seal seats as
far as it can in the frame.  Then have your helper just lightly push against
the glass with hands spread wide.  At this point the helper is just to keep an
eye on the window and seal and thier hands in place to catch them to make sure
that they do not fall out while you pull the seal over the window frame.  Get
into the VW and pull on the wires at the tied spot.  When the tied area is in
then untie the wire ends and while keeping hold of each end of the wire with
each hand pull alittle here and a little there at a angle of about 45 degrees
from the glass and toward the center of the pane of glass.  Trying not to go
too unevenly compaired to the other side working from the bottom to the top.
Afterward carefully pull the small lengths of rubber area/s that you did not
get inside to get there by gently pulling( Not prying against the frame.)the
rubber edge up and over the window frame with either a very dull butter knife
or slot tip screw driver.  Then clean the glass but not the body with kerosene
or tar remover unless the paint is at least three weeks old.  With fresh paint
wait at least three weeks before cleaning tar off body to let paint cure and
not end up getting removed with the stuff you use to remove the tar.   Eric &amp;
