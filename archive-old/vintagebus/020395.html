Subject: Shipping bus parts overseas
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Need some help out there.  I need to ship a Westfalia
tow hitch from England to California.  I do not care
about the time table.  I am thinking that by boat is
the cheapest way.  Steve Harris did this some time
ago.

My question is....  Not living in England and having
never been there, what is the easiest way for a friend
in England to get my bar shipped to me.  Is the post
office the right place for him to go?

Any suggestions out there.  I want to stay away from
air freight because of the cost.  My main goal is to
get it here, but without paying too much. (i am
thinking in the $50-$100 range for shipping.)

Thanks
