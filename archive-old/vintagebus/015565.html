I've seen many different &quot;interpretations&quot; of dove blue...

I had mine color-matched from a nice radio block-off.  I think it's too
dark though.  Oh well.

On the issue of &quot;it's not restored unless it's original color&quot; I think
along the same lines, but I think there can be exceptions.  If there's
anything to document that your bus was changed for some reason, ie 
go'd, then I say it's fair game.  I think commericals are fair game
as logn as you stay away from the cal-look type paint colros and schemes.

But it's your money.  Once you realize you're laying out long green for
paint and materials, and long hours sanding and prepping, I'll bet you feel
less of an urge to do a metal-flake prismatic paint which will be out of style
by the end of the summer.

&gt; correct formula?  It would be nice to get it right.
