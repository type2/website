Keywords:  Jalousie splitty glass, 1967, price, cost, reproduction, repro,
safety glass.

This is for a 1967 Westy.

I went to a local glass place and handed them one of the panes of glass and
said &quot;how much to repro&quot;.  Answer was $10.80 each without the logo on each
piece, another $5 to have the edges &quot;pencil ground&quot; to match.  OUCH.  This
wasn't some fancy place... is that what these things are going for?

I need 6 pieces... anyone have some good ones from a junker?  I'm on a
budget for this project and was hoping to get some originals at better than
repro price :)

Thanks.
