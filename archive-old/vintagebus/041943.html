&gt; It ain't a side effect, the patient croaks. The shims work like a gear
&gt; reduction. If your flywheel thrust surface rubbed directly on the thrust
&gt; surface of the front main bearing, it would see one revolution of wear for
&gt; each revolution. With steel against aluminum, say about a hundred turns
&gt; before she is all ate up. So you take 3 shims and put them in there. Not 2,
&gt; not 4, but 3(three). So the flywheel rubs against the first shim. Say it
&gt; turns once for each two revs of the flywheel. Okey dokey, then it in turn
&gt; rubs against the second shim. One for two again. Now the second shim rubs
&gt; against the third shim, half speed again. Now this third shim, it rubs
&gt; against the thrust surface of the forward main bearing, which by this point
&gt; thinks it is still relaxing in the garage. I am sure that as sure as God
&gt; made little green apples someone will write in with the corrected
&gt; mathematical reduction of this formula,

Well, first of all, where would aluminum rub against the bearing?  The
flywheel is steel.

Second, bearings almost always are made of dissimilar metals, so using the
shims as thrust bearings wouldn't work too well.  I doubt that they move
much relative to each other in operation.

the shim-thrust bearing interface is designed to move, with lubrication
designed to keep the shim and bearing separated through constant supply of
lubricant from the bearing.

Third, in a very similar engine, Porsche uses a single shim.

My take on this is that VW decided to use multiple shims so that a stack
of any thickness could be made up from a limited variety of shims.  The
Porsche approach requires a greater variety of shims be stocked, but a
thicker shim is much less likely to be deformed by the stronger pressure
plate in Porsche vehicles.

Three is the number in VWs, but be sure to put the thinnest shim in the
middle!
