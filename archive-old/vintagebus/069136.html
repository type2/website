Subject: Re: [VB] Gas tank install question.

I'm working on putting a 15 gal tank in my bus and have this problem as well.

When you say tar paper is this like the felt used on house roofs or is it more like the asphalt
based sound damping matieral that is used on the rear bulkhead over the engine compartment?

I have some of the asphalt based stuff. It is similar to Dynamat and I got it at McMaster Carr after
I read a thread about sound damping in the archives. I thought of using this stuff but I was afraid
that it might compress too much over time and cause the tank to become loose and shift around (not
good!).

&gt; The pieces that were there look like they might have been felt but they were
&gt; so oil soaked and squashed it's hard to tell what they were originally.

Hi Ed,
A kind of felt is what they seem to be.  We use folded pieces of tar paper
under the tank.  Why?  Because the two plaes that bus gas tanks rust out is:
1.  Where theses felt strips hold water like sponges under the tank and rust
through.
2.  The area near the outlet tube in the bottom of the tank traps water and
gunk in the bottom of the tank.  To prevent this cut the outlet tubing as far
down inside the tank or if using a reserve switch remove the shorter tube
completely.
