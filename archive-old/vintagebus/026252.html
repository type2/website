Hi to all.

I have gotten a handle on my time and am able to get back to the VB
list.  To re-introduce myself:

Matthew Henricks
I own a 64 sunroof bug that my G-pa bought new (daily driver)
60 single  (work truck)
65 21 window deluxe micro (that i am STILL doing a full resto on)

I have owned 2 crew cab's and a few other kombies in the past.  Also a
standard duluxe.

I have been working on the 65 for 22 months.  Full ground up resto.  The
bus was totally striped and media blasted.  I then did all the body work
and painted the bus sealing wax red/beige gray.  The bus is painted,
pollished and is being put back together slowly right now.  I just
finished all the wiring (with help from Steve Harris) and have rebuilt
all the peddles and stearing mechanism.  I am stalled on doing any more
rubber and trim install untill i get a headliner installed. (no i will
not try this myself.  I am looking for someone to do it)  I have yet to
do anything with the trany or engine.  I am in search for someparts if
anyone can help.  I will post that in a separate message.

It is good to be back.  I hope to be albe to contribute to the list.

Thanks
Matthew
