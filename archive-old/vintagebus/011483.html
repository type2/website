	I am really interested in restoring an old bus...but have never
attempted it before and am very wet behind the ears in this matter. What
Id really like to is to help someone with their resto project and learn
in the process. I live in San Jose CA and wouldn't mind helping someone
out and learn at the same time. I work during the week so weekends are
open.
