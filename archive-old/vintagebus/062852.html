Subject: RE: [VB] Westy_dot_dealer camper interior 

  Thank you for the info. I couldn't figure it out. I am looking at 2
different hatchtops and the owners said there were SO 34, they both have the
same interior ( mosaic) and non flip seat. So it appears that both of these
hatch tops were ordered with a removable interior and not stationary. 
  So did all SO 34/35 come with flip front seats?
  I guess I need one of those also to ad to my hatch top collection.

ronnie

ps. It would be really nice (if not done allready) if somebody would build a
site of all the Westy camper interior variations. I have looked and have
never found them all in one place on the net

differencebetween a SO 34 interior and the dealer option Mosaic kit??  I
have 
lookedat 2 Westy's with the SO 34 interior and it looks the same as the 
Mosaic Ihave in my 15 window Deluxe. I cannot see any difference between the

2. Did the Mosaic come from Westfalia for a dealer install? &lt;&lt;

The SO-34 &amp; 35 are the same kit the SO-34 has white formica cabinets and the

35 has wood venier.  The rear cabinets of both of these take up both sides
of 
the rear all the way forward to where the rear seat/bed would be just behind

the rear cargo door opening in the SO-34, SO-42, and SO-44 Westies.  These 
cabinets are much deeper than any other cabinet sets so as to only allow a 
single flip up seat between them where the later rear seat/bed would be.
The 
mid seat in the SO-34 &amp; 35s is sideways to any other bus cargo bay seats so 
as to have the up to three passengers on this facing/look out the cargo 
doors.
  Mosaic SO-33 interiors were definitely a dealer option/accessory one could

order and install in thier Kombi or other type bus or could be ordered to 
come in a Westie body.  The SO-34 &amp; 35 interiors are screwed into place, the

SO-33 was designed to quickly unlatch/fold up and out of the bus/Westie in a

very short time.
