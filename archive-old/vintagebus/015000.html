Sure.  You reach around and undo the bolt that holds the fan onto the
generator shaft.  Don't forget to be ready to catch the shims.  An
extra elbow helps in this procedure, as do long fingers....

FWIW, except for the gasoline showers (see other thread), I find it's
much less painful to pull the engine than to try to find some way of
avoiding it.  I have a friend that replaced the heads on her bus that
way.  It just doesn't seem worth the effort, though.

Also, why would you need the neighbor kids to help?  Engine removal's
a one-person problem.  Putting it back in is slightly easier with a
helper, but not that much....

YMMV, etc, etc.
