I believe two part epoxy paints (single or two stage) cure by a chemical
process.  Enamel cures by solvent evaporation ...in essence &quot;dries&quot; out.  You
only need to wait long periods of time for enamel to dry.  You don't want to
seal in (with wax) any of the carrier solvents.  They could cause problems down
the road.

The longer you wait with the epoxy the harder it gets.  Good if you are using it
as is, but makes it real tough to color sand if you wait too long.
