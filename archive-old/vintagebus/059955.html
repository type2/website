Subject: Re: [VB] without guessing fuel measurements!

Every single time I buy gas I record the mileage on the odometer, the amount
of gas, and the cost of the gas.  I fill up at approximately every 200 mi.
(I use Imperial and not U.S. gallons - actually I convert from litres into
Imperial Gallons).  I will run of gas at around 250 mi.  I keep my reserve
switch in shape but I prefer not to use it.

l Change here to report something that must have been reported
&gt; before.  My 61' Side Loader has no gas sender or gauge, I try to keep it
&gt; topped off and often pull into gas stations with no idea of how much I
&gt; need.  Since here in used jersey, you cannot pump your own, I usually get
&gt; someone who does not speak english as an attendent.  Last week the
&gt; attendent put 12 gal. in my 10 gal. tank.  I became very confused and the
&gt; attendent could not comprehend my complaint.  Since I'm using the POR15
&gt; gas tank sealant on my gates and I have an extra tank that need the
&gt; treatment, I decided to use my home depot yardstick and measure gallons.
&gt; You can only put the yardstick in one way - horizontal.  Here are the
&gt; results -
&gt;
&gt; &lt;2 gal. - no wetness on yardstick
&gt; 3 gal. - 1.5&quot; wetness
&gt; 4 gal. - 3&quot;
&gt; 5 gal. - 4.5&quot;
&gt; 6 gal. - 5.75&quot;
&gt; 7 gal. - 7.375&quot;
&gt; 8 gal. - 8.875&quot;
&gt; 9 gal. - 10.5&quot;
&gt; 10 gal. - 12.125&quot;
&gt; filled to the top of the neck - 10.5 gal.
&gt;
&gt;   Since I was not that scientific (yes, I spilled some) - use this as
&gt; striking ballpark figures.  Tell'em Small Change uses rulers too!
