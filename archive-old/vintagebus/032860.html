&lt;&lt; So it's that tromp l' oel stuff?  Could be a fertile canvas for the Martha 
Stewart crowd. Painted on crow's feet, shadowbox semaphores, extra windows 
painted on kombi's and panels. Peel-off rust decals to put on just for 
Jerome! Painted on skylights and sunroofs! It's a vast rolling canvas.  &gt;&gt;

Just last Friday I saw a bay window painted two tone, with the white coming 
down to a V in the front.  Impostor splitty!  Made me slam on the brakes and 
make a second look.
