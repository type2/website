Subject: RE: [VB] 6V battery questions

The 65 bug I had years ago was a 40hp 6V and I had all sorts of problems
with the battery voltage. The first was a bad battery with shorted
plates that wouldn't take a charge. It would read slightly above 6V but
had little current and wouldn't crank over the engine. That problem was
due to the fact that few people want or need 6V batteries and it had set
on the shelf too long. The next was charging. I ended up cleaning the
GEN brushes and replacing the VR. I started getting a good charge then.
After that it was chasing down current drops all over the car, lights,
wipers, radio, etc. I ended up putting a relay on the headlight circuit
and running two #10 wires direct to the headlights from the battery
through the relay, much brighter lights.

Hey guys,

battery question...I have a 6V interstate battery, I was having trouble
starting my bus, so I got one of those trickle chargers at my FLAPS, you
hook the battery up, it charges at about 1.5 amps....anyway after
hooking it up, the thing says&quot;charging&quot; for a little while, then slowly
the &quot;trouble&quot; light comes on. I checked everything-it is hooked up
correctly, the connections look clean.
Thanks
