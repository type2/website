Thom,

I've been an admirer of yours for the past couple of years, even before
you became the administrator of this list...

I'm guessing you're a pretty straight laced guy, which is ok by me. I
respect one who is intelligent and articulate (and especially into
buses, like me!) regardless of their social status...

Buses are simple machines in this age of increasing complexity. They are
also the most versatile machines ever built, in my opinion. They deserve
to be preserved, at any cost. I have put more $$$ in my bus than it is
worth with no regrets, as you have into yours.

I don't think you should dis' the hippies. They have given this machine,
fine as it is, its mystique. I've gotten several comments on mine about
its qualities as a party machine. Several more as a romantic hideway, in
so many words... Buses have something of a naughty reputation (and well
deserved) which appeals to the rebellious side of most people...like
Harley Davidson motorcycles.

I don't think buses would still be around in the numbers that they are
today except for this appeal. How many pieces of domestic iron can you
count from the same vintage as buses?
