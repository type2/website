&gt; Always remember - when installing the shifter plate, the long tab with the

Hmm,

i think this is what i did... i have a 61, so im sure it is different from
your 66 and 67 (they had a different arrangement...)

i will tear it apart tonight and take a look.  It works, but it kinda bugs
me that it doesnt work right, you know...

take care,

Steve
