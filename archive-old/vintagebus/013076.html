i like using platic putty knives and concentrated orange degreasere stuff..

the plastic putty knife is stiff enough to scapre undercoating off (after it
has been softened up by the orange stuff) plus it doesn't scratch the paint.

those 3M scouring pads that you would use to clean your dishes are also good
for the hard to reach places or the final go over.

that orange stuff i use is made by

goes by the trade name
