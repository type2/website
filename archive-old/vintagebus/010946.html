Martin,

If it is less than $5K, then get it... don't worry about the engine.  A
rust-free double cab, especially one that old, is an impossible find.  Heck,
$6K would be low.  These things are RARE, most were used and abused.  A 40
year old pick-up truck and the bed is in &quot;excellent shape&quot;!

I'm sure someone can help you on the engine questions... I just wanted to
chime in that you have a one-of-a-kind find.

I have just rejoined this list because I am in the process of buying a 1961
crew cab. The bus is very nice and mostly original except is has a 1500/1600
single port engine. The body is in excellent shape and essentially rust
free! It still has the splash plate under the front end, no rust under the
battery or anywhere under the truck on the frame. The bed is clean and rust
free with home made wood slats that are glued down but look pretty good.
There is no rust in the floors anywhere. There also appears to be no rust
under the windows.
