&gt;This is my first post.

Cool, welcome aboard!

&gt;I took the ignition switch and door handles out and they are all stamped 
&gt;with the same number.

That's a good thing.

&gt;Does this mean that I can just order new keys from a good VW parts 
&gt;supplier with this number?

You can get keys but probably not from a VW parts supplier.  If they
have anything it will be the key blanks but it will still be up to you
to get them cut locally.

Your best bet is to visit or call local locksmiths and ask them if
they can make a '67 VW key by key code.  VW published books relating
the number you find on the locks to the key blank shape and notch
pattern needed, and a locksmith that's been around long enough
should have one (or a copy of the information).

The dealer should theoretically be able to do this as well, but the
general list experience seems to be that the VW dealer only cares
about you if you are going to pay cash for a new Jetta.

You may want to take the locks with you when you go to the locksmith.
Once you have a key, you or the locksmith can try it in all the lock
cylinders to make sure it works OK.  If any of the cylinders are
damaged internally, the locksmith can probably replace the tumblers
so that all your locks still work with one key.

Advice: Get plenty of keys made and test them all, then keep one of
the keys with the title or insurance papers or whatever - that is,
not in the Bus.  That way you have a spare in case of disaster, and
also an unworn key that can be reliably duplicated on the machines
that hardware stores have.

Good luck!
