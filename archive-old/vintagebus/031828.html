No! I was picking up the 60 Hatch top Westy I just bought and delivering
another bus to Rich Yost (he's got a pretty nice and dry Double Cab for
sale), I also got to check out his new 3000 square foot shop (20 foot
ceilings)and all the parts and all his other buses. If you want to check his
place out, he has the pre OCTO camp-out at Christmas tree Island. Just
another section of his property!

ronnie  I'm back

ps. Still waiting for all the tree removel to be completed to get the BD
Delux out!.
