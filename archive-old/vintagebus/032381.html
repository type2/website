&gt;There's also the &quot;Spec Guide&quot; from the English Split Screen Bus Club, but
&gt;it's out of print, although there's rumored to be an update in the making.
&gt;Check with NEATO or Dave Eccles in England, or perhaps Dave Easterwood.

The &quot;Split Screen Transporter: Specifications, Modifications &amp; Optional Extras&quot;
booklet that was released as a collaborative effort between England's Split 
Screen
Van Club, Germany's Bulli Kartei &amp; NEATO in the USA back in 1998 has been
sold out since June of 1999.

Dave Eccles, formerly of SSVC, was the lead editor on the project.  With 
his recent
leaving of the SSVC, I am unsure as to the current status of the project, 
because I
am not sure where the copyright lies.

There were a lot of editorial corrections submitted by myself, Mark 
Lapriore and Tom
Brouillette before the booklet was printed, but they did not make it into 
the first
printing, due to the SSVC wanting to rush the booklet to print so they 
could have the
booklet for sale at one of the big shows in Europe.  At the time, we were 
assured the
corrections would go into the 2nd printing which we thought we would do 
after a few
years.

I will contact Dave Eccles &amp; see where the three clubs should go to from 
here if there
is still an interest in producing a 2nd edition with updated information.

Dave Easterwood
