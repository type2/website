Well, made it home to Cd'A today with just a few very minor problems with
the bus!
I started out headin' down to the Boise area to hang out with friends.
The drive down was very uneventful with the exception of a couple of
engine misses on the way down which I knew was old points since I haven't
replaced them in forever (why I didn't replace them before I left I don't
know).  Got to see my buddy Chip's freshly repainted '64(?) Kombi and a
couple other assorted Volkswagens in his shop.  That was about it for
Volkswagen activity there.

On Tuesday I headed out towards Vegas after a quick tune up.  Had my ska
compilation and other assorted ska and punk CDs playing and/or readily
available.  Everything was going great with the exception of the bus
running a little hot, but that's normal for this engine.  I stopped
somewhere in Utah to sleep in the bus and froze my a$$ off!  The next
morning I took off and the speedo imediately started making grinding
noises and the needle started bouncing.  After a while the needle was
spinning wildly and it eventially broke off!  I didn't think I was going
that fast!!!
Later that afternoon I was stopped on the interstate by a big accident so
I shut off the bus and listened to music.  when I went to start it again
it didn't.  I thought I killed the battery, but everything still worked,
so I climbed under the bus with my trustly flat-head screwdriver and
jumped the solinoid just enough to turn the starter a few times.  Then the
key worked fine.  This happened a couple more times throughout the trip.

The third and most annoying thing that happened on the trip was last night
I went to turn on the head lights and nothing happened!  The speedo light
and the taillights worked, but no headlights.  I narrowed it down to the
dimmer switch and ended up cutting the wires and just taping them
together.  Worked like a charm!

I noticed unusually bad wear on all tires (and they're almost brand
new).

*Important note*  For those of you who don't know (or just don't believe
it), split-windshield VW Buses are total chick magnets!!!  Just drive the
interstate between Vegas and Boise and see how chicks give you a wave and
a smile.

One more thing....didn't see one other split window bus on the whole
trip!!!

Check out some pics at my web-site soon.  Thanx for reading!
