&lt;&lt;I'm having the same problem as Meredith is. I took mine to the shop and my 
mechanic tightened the front coupler on my 66. The problem with mine is that 
it has been drilled out and a bolt put through and The hole is worn into an 
oval shape. Also mine is a front dowel support version(66-67only) and I think 
I need to find replacement rods. Any ideas where I can find them? I've not 
been able to locate a supplier. Any ideas would be appreciated. Janet, Split

Hi Janet,
  Is the hole in your shift linkage the tapered kind of countersunk hole that 
is ovaled out?  Not the threaded hole that the square headed bolt threads 
into the collar first?  If it is the former we have been able to weld closed 
the damaged hole.  First scribe the location of the hole on the rod before 
welding.  Grind the weld smooth, and redrill the coutersunk hole with a drill 
bit that we hand ground to the proper angle.  The only problem with this hand 
ground drill bit is that it leaves the bottom a little flat spot at the tip.  
To remove this so the stock bolt will seat properly we drill this flat bottom 
just a little more to recess this flat farther in with a 1/8&quot; or smaller 
drill bit.  After all the square headed bolt has a tapered pointed tip to 
mesh with the sides of the tapered hole in the shift rod not really the very 
bottom.  Yes you could probably just grind the bolt tip, but we figure it is 
best to have the stock bolt always work right off each time.  This way you or 
the next owner of your bus does not have to learn the hard way and maybe 
cause the same damage as what you have already.
  If it is instead or at the same time the threaded collar hole that is 
damaged you can simply drill and tap a new hole in the collar since it slips 
off the shift rod for ease of repair.
  There are wrecking yards (Or perhaps a list memeber that has your year 
shift rod.) out there that should be able to replace the shift rod if that is 
what you want to do.  Averre's up here in Washington is one we can think of, 
but do not have our buisness/hobby card here to give you thier phone number.  
Or if you can park your bus and ship the rod/collar we could fix what you 
have. 

&lt;&lt; Your carburetor info helped us tune my son's bug, Thanks! &gt;&gt;
Glad we could help!  Eric&amp;Barb
