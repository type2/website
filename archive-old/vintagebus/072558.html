Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

I would be very interested in aircooled_dot_net's list of known defects of
the new aluminum type 1 cases. There seems to be considerable confusion
regarding this, and the frequency in which they appear.

I consider myself pretty tenacious but I think I'd just have tried to get
my money back.
After you've done all of the Research and Development for the case
manufacturer you're still stuck with a May-Pop Engine because you might
still have missed something.
You may have saved them many thousands of dollars with your efforts to
use their product but you'll never get a thank you or a check and
absolutely not a case that is properly cleaned and machined.
I just could never have any faith in any part that gave this much grief.
I must admit you photography is very good and the problems are clerarly
defined.
