I have no idea whether or not there is a 6 V alternator.  I assume that
there is, and I also assume that if there is, it is significantly more
expensive than it's 12 volt counterpart.  I can, however, throw out a
suggestion.  If I were in your position, I would use a transformer.
    As an alternator (aka AC generator) produces AC, you can easily install
a 2:1 transformer.  You would simply install the transformer at the
alternator's output before the 6 v voltage regulator.  The average
transformer is between 85-95% efficient, so there would be a loss, but not
anything to concern yourself with.  Your voltage would be cut in half, but
your current would nearly double.  Additionally, you could tap a second line
in before the transformer, install a 12 volt voltage regulator, and use it's
output to power any 12 V accessories that you choose to install.  With a
little time, and a little creativity, you could do really well with this
setup.  I have never done this with a vehicle, but I am quite sure that it
would work assuming that you could find a 6v regulator for use with an
alternator Vs. a 6v generator.  If you can't, I'd be happy to build you one
for the cost of parts, plus credit on any web page etc. that you may post
about the conversion.  Let me know if you are interested.

HTH,
