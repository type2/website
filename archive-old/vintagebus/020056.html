&gt; sporadically.  So, does this sound like a switch problem (my first 
&gt; guess), an electrical wiring problem (it wouldn't be surprising seeing 
&gt; some of the other electrical things done by the PO), or just that the 
&gt; high beam setting on both my headlights is out (it couldn't really be 
&gt; that simple could it?!?!?)
