Subject: Re: [VB] bad manners &amp; distributor question

yeah, lets not forget that some of us &quot;hippie types&quot; or peaceniks once
served in the military also.  i, for one, was in the army for five and a
half years, 2 of them spent in the 1st Ranger battalion and about 3 in the
82nd airborne division.  i served my time, so now some other kid can go
fight in another country while i sit here and wait for the enemy to invade
my turf, then ill pick up a gun and fight for our own ground.  we all know
paul has his guns ready, right paul :)  im not gonna protest bombing whoever
is responsible for this, but i feel that people should be able to speak
their mind.  however, this isnt the place to get into stupid email battles
over non-bus topics.  i know ive been guilty of this recently and even now,
but im done with my sarcastic replies in defense of myself and others like
me.  im just going to ignore it all for now because there is too much other
stuff to worry about.  lets all just try to stick together.  as for bus
content, i have the stock distributor for my 65, but the vaccum canister is
shot, i also have a 1300 beetle distributor which appears to be the same
except for the canister.  what difference would this make if i used the
canister from the 1300?  thanks!
josh

&gt;  Amen...beautifully said, Les.

into a peacenik on the list. After I did so, I had
&gt; second thoughts about it. And then I was chastised for it by Clara. And,
&gt; as usual, she was correct. And though I won't apologize for the
&gt; substance of my remarks, because I think my complaints and feelings to
&gt; be valid, nonetheless I would like to apologize for the way I made the
&gt; criticisms. I could have excercised a lot more restraint in the way I
&gt; made those remarks. To any I may have offended, please accept my
&gt; apology.
&gt;
&gt; In my defense, these are trying times. I didn't expect to be so
&gt; affected. I thought I was too. . .. hell, I don't even know the right
&gt; word here. But suffice it to say that the last few days have been real
&gt; strange. Got lunch at a shopping mall and it seemed as if everyone was
&gt; in slow motion. It was a feeling I was sort of used to, being a product
&gt; of the sixties. But there were no substances involved and, this time,
&gt; everyone truely was in slow motion. I think the whole crowd was
&gt; experiencing a sort of altered state of consciousness bordering on
&gt; shock. Hell, I suppose it was shock. I supppose it is not just our
&gt; nation feeling it, but the entire world, too. At least the civilized
&gt; part of it.
&gt;
&gt; And if I havem't made this statement here before, let me do it now: I
&gt; believe it the duty of all Americans and especially men, to get into tip
&gt; top shape. Because they have brought their JIHAD to us. And our families
&gt; are their targets. And we will never know just when they will strike.
&gt; But when they do, we should be prepared to return their serve: to give
&gt; them their JIHAD. I swear to you. . . when I fly (perhaps in two weeks),
&gt; if any of these RAT BASTARDS tries some shit, they will have to kill me
&gt; first. And I seriously mean it. I swear to you. . . I would just love to
&gt; throw one of those RAT BASTARDS off the plane: to give him a premature
&gt; introduction to Allah.
&gt;
&gt; And I hope you will forgive my off topic ramblings. I needed to let
&gt; loose. Worked on the bus yesterday, and even that lacked satisfaction.
&gt;
&gt; I will try to stay on topic from here on out.
