Mike,
your 64 should have the latest style redux box trans, affectionately
known in the type2 world as the &quot;big nut tranny&quot;. I do 60 all day long
in mine, many do speeds better than that, if all engine cooling is at
optimum. Others whose opinion I respect say anything over 53 in a big
nut is over-revving. The speed is limited by the engine RPMs. You will
potentially damage the engine by going to fast and over-revving, not the
tranny, even though it is the tranny that makes the engine go so
stinking fast at highway speeds....it is geared low.

The reduction boxes take 90 weight GL4 hypoid gear oil. DO NOT use GL-5,
GL-6, or GL 4-5-6.  Anything but straight GL4 may hurt your synchros.
The redux boxes and center section transmission all are an open system.
Oil travels from the trans to the redux boxes through the axle boots and
axle tubes. But you can and should fill the redux boxes before the
center section, this way  you will be certain to put enough in the
center section. When you fill the boxes, take the wheel off, and take
out the 17mm allen plug at the top of each box. ( Drain the old stuff
with teh bottom plug if you are completely changing ) and when you add
oil, spin the drom slowly so it gets by the top gear. Then change or top
off the center section ( transaxle) by adding oil while the vehicle is
level front to back, only until it spliis over the side, and no more.

A good time to change axle boots (if either is checking or leaking) is
after you drain the center section, and before you refill it....:)

I love the smell of gear oil!
