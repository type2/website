 I built a nice, strong 1776 for my 58 single cab and treated it to a pair of
 Weber 40 IDFs so I could be sure and get really crappy gas mileage.  And let
 me tell you, that puppy will move!  But what's been bugging me is the
 severely limited top end (and the fact that even with all that torque I
 still find 3rd gear before I'm all the way across a big intersection).  I
 make about 67 MPH (tested to be accurate) at about 4000 RPM with 26.5&quot;
 diameter tires and I know I have (or at least paid for) a 4.125 R&amp;P and that
 pretty much corresponds to the speed/rev table that was posted.
 
 But what I'm wondering is, what is that 3.44 R&amp;P listed in the table?  And
 for that matter, the 3.875?  Where do you find such things?  As long as
 you've got the power to push a bus with that taller gearing, are there any
 drawbacks? &gt;&gt;

the 3.875 r&amp;p comes out of an april 72 and later beetle.   I don't know where 
that 3.44 came from.   I haven't looked at the table, :(   Also, with your 
58, are your running 1.39 or 1.26 reduction boxes?  If you switch to the 
later rear axles/boxes/brakes, you should also switch to the later front 
beam/spindles/brakes.
