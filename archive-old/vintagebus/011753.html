Hey all,

I will spare you all of the in depth details in this post as I will be
uploading all the pictures I took along with a more detailed account of the
get together to my personal website.  Here are the highlights:

&lt;-----Thursday: 
11pm - Left from Ponca City, OK in my '69 (Westy Interior) with wifey,
buddy &amp; his girl in a '67 Westy

12am - Met with listee Rob Dahlgren and his girl in Bartlesville, OK to
caravan along in his '69 Kombi

.....CB chatter all night thru........70 degree outside, 230 engine temp

&lt;-----Friday:
2am - We discover David Schwarze was correct in his assessment that Voltage
Isolators are not the best way to charge two batteries.  It worked great
for about a year, but I guess they burn out.  We push start my '69 from a
gas station with Isolator bypassed.

10am - Arrival of our 2 Bays and 1 Split at BBTA campground (500+miles).  A
hearty welcome by the Illustrious Charlie Ford.  A reasonable amount of
chaos associated with deciding where we were going to camp.  We were DEAD
tired.  I crash out for a couple hours.

11am - I think Ted Finesman and maybe a couple other listees came by to say
Hi.  Sorry guys.

12pm - I tried getting up for a bit and take a couple pictures but I was
stilll hurting pretty bad.  I crash out for a couple more hours.

10pm - I visit Charlie Ford's tent and we chat about the list, how we arent
going to discuss the Hoover conspiracy(?), future road trips, icons, the
like.

&lt;-----Saturday:
12am - Bed time, no breeze, high temp (80+, Unusual), everyone to bed early

8am - I got up early because I knew everyone would be racing around to get
things together for the Caravan scheduled at 11am.  I got to try out my
electric griddle.  Everytime I turned it on, it would wipe out the whole
Western wing of campsites of power.  Darn.

10am - Topeka, KS contingent show up in a *J33P*.  Shame on you Steven Reed
and Rick Taylor.

11am - My buddy and I were lined up #51 and #52 in group two of the
caravan.  We got caught up at a stop light just before the exit on to the
Interstate.  We ran 70+ mph for about 15 minutes and never caught up with
the group again.  Darn.

12pm - Got some great video tape of the very talented band from Wisconsin
that was tuning up for the Evening.  We still dont know what kind of music
it is they play normally, but they did an excellent &quot;Black&quot; by Pearl Jam.

1pm - Our group of three couples load up in my buddy's '67 on our way to
the Casinos (thats how we got the girls to come in the first place and this
is what they wanted to do over a silly old caravan anyway).  

6pm - Back to camp.  Visited with Rick Dennis....finally got his shifter
extender to him.

7pm - Visited with KC's Jon Christensen and family.  Beers and lawn chairs
to the Staff Pavillion for awards and door prizes.

8pm - Beers and lawn chairs to the DBG's Live Band tent.  Tested Ted
Finesman's &quot;spiked&quot; marchino cherries....yes.

......bantering with beer and lawn chairs........

11pm - more visiting with Charlie

&lt;---------Sunday

3am - visited with Bill Bowman (Neato Pres, BBTA organizer)  about how he
and his wife met.......buses......production

4am - bedtime, a breeze and much cooler weather (low 70's)

9am - up, video taped the entire site with hair in the air.

12pm - started back for home

2pm - stopped in small German town (everything closed), met back up with
Rob Dahlgren and Karen, had lunch along roadside picnic area

7pm - traded buses with my buddy, I drove his '67....very cramped but
smiling even bigger....he drove my '69.

11pm - Camped up top my favorite campsite in Cassville, MO.

&lt;-------Mon

11am - slept in, continued home

2pm - outside temp 106 degrees,  engine temp 240...ouch, back in Oklahoma

3pm - checked out two '59's in a town called Afton, OK....got a set of old
rear window jail bars (FS), a T-handle for rear hatch, and two window
latches (one to go to Rex in TX).

5pm - stopped in state park saw deer and wild turkey, fished and let
engines cool.

7pm - home safely (1200miles total) after cruising at 45mph to keep engine
temp down .
