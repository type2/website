I totally agree.
BUT, Gene was around when Synthetic oil changed, Gene was around when the
94mm cylinders changed, etc, etc.  The amount of testing that he did in the
70's (and earlier) was NOT continued to keep up with the times.  GBE still
publishes 'findings' from the 70's in thier catalog and tech manuals.  They
really do need an 'update', that cannot be denied.

Again, I'm not bashing Gene, nor do I feel that Gene is wrong on a lot of
stuff, just that times change, and so must information to keep it accurate.

&gt; One of the things you must remeber about the research that Gene did was
that
&gt; it was all relative. The only synthetic oil on the market at the time was
&gt; Mobil One, and it did run hot in air cooled engines. That is specifically
&gt; why the FAA banned it from Lincolns and Lycoming aircraft engine use. We
now
&gt; have many synthetic oils available that do meet the requirements of hot
&gt; aircooled engines. But alas, Gen's not here to see them.
&gt;
&gt; The original thin wall 92 and 94mm cylinders were bad news. Nowadays we
have
&gt; better quality and more choices. But again, Gene is not here to try them
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; Everything is relative. Like you said, he contributed a lot to the VW
&gt; community using things available to him at the time and products he
&gt; developed himself when there wasn't anything to use in its place.
&gt;
&gt; As far as Gene goes, he wasn't God, but in his time he was the best we
had.
&gt; Let's keep it in perspective, OK?

&gt; Gene Berg was a legend in his own mind.
&gt; He did a LOT for the VW scene, but there are things that he strongly
&gt; believed that are just not true (Synthetic oil makes your heads run hot,
&gt; chromoly headstuds dont work in daily drivers, 94mm P&amp;C's dont have any
&gt; dependability, if the product wasn't supplied by GBE, it wont last
&gt; sufficiently, etc, etc......) .  Don't believe everything that he put down
&gt; in his writings, take everything with a grain of salt.
&gt;
&gt; But not to sound like i'm bashing Berg, he did a TON of stuff that helped
&gt; the VW hobby and I do appreciate that. So no flame wars please.....

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Didnt know that. Gene Berg was THE god of Modifying VW engines and he
&gt; really
&gt; &gt; knew what he was talking about.
