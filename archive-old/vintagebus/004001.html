Two questions here. I want to paint my bus yellow below the belt and white
on the top. Question I have is is it true that some colors are harder/more
expensive to paint than others? I plan to either do it myself or have it
done, whichever seems more viable. I have no experience except with model
car painting, which I'm sure is much different. Other question is, everyone
around here I've talked to about bodywork says
fiberglass,fiberglass,fiberglass. I read in auto magazines and books about
the 'old fashioned way with lead'. What gives here? It seems here in
Michigan people would want to do things that way, seems it would last
longer, here in the salt belt. Thanks for any help.
