Subject: Re: [VB] Painting the Beltline
To: RDAVIS_at_sbch_dot_org, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the colours meet at the crease below the beltline, just under the belt, if you know what I mean.  And yes, that follows around the nosetoo, so the upper colour will be on the V, and the lower colour meets it just at the lower edge of the V.   You can tape off the first colour when you do the second.  After doing my 65 and noticing the tape line was a little wiggly, I lookad at the original (but faded) paint on my 61, and noticed that there too the line was wiggly, actually a bit more than on my 65's repaint.\

hope this helps,

Clara
