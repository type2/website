&gt;I have a 3:88 ring and pinion and reduction boxes and love it.  Nice
&gt;freeway speeds (but does suck with a full load of swap stuff going up a
&gt;STEEP hill.)  I would think any good VW tranny place could set you up.


I 2nd this.  Ronnie at www.type2parts_dot_com told me this would make a great
way to run my 66.  The tranny is a Rancho 3.88 brand new in the box.  All I
gotta do is supply my nosecone from my old tranny and I'm set.  I paid
around $460 for it, but I'm sure they've gone up by now.  You keep your
redux boxes via this method as well - not a bad thing.  I had the tranny
made with a 12v housing but with a 6v bushing so if I decide to go 12V in
the future, I can put in an autostick bug starter (2 bucks cheaper than a
standard one thru Pep Boys) and 12V flywheel and not worry about it.
