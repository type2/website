This past week I bought one of those 10x20 shelters from CostCo.
None of the local outlets had them in stock, so I had to order it
online and got stuck $86 for shipping.

So, a couple days later it arrives on my doorstep.  After nearly herniating
myself getting it into the house, I set about putting it up.

It requires absolutely no tools to set up.  It is kinda tricky getting it
started though, as there is not enoug tension on some of the parts to 
keep them together during assembly, so I did a bit of tail chasing until
I decided to use bungees to put tension on them until I could get enough
of it together to make it self-supporting.  Then a bungee let go and smacked
me good in the forehead, making a really nice cut.  Ow.  I would
have engineered more pins into the design, which would take slightly
longer to set up, but would make it much more stable during the 
process.

Anyway, eventually I got it set up, and this thing is pretty darn big!
It's about 7' at the lowest point, somewhere ~12' at the peak.  It's big enough
to get the double-door inside and open the doors.  It comes with 2 side panels,
which I'm not using right now, but no front and real panels.
It would be entirely feasible to  engineer some front and rear panels,
to fully enclose your baby.  It's light enough that one person could scooch
it around a short distance to get it into position.  The covering is
your standard heavy duty plastic tarp, which I don't expect will
last more than a few years (2-4 maybe).  

Cost, signed sealed and delivered, was $275.  Base price is $170, plus
shipping and tax, etc.
