Dick Bozarth aka The Guru came down from Omaha yesterday to assist me with
my dual carbed 1776.  I know next to nothing about these carbs so having his
help was greatly appreciated.

We noticed something funny about these 40IDFs which I installed CB
Performance's venturi mod kits in.  The accelerator jets are squirting a
little bit of fuel out with each intake stroke on all 4 carbs.  Dick had
never seen this before and even though the carbs are synched, they aren't
supposed to be doing this.

Dick has a well thought out remedy that involves removing a little lead plug
on the carb and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this will solve
the problem however, I wanted to refer to the VWTrends or hotVW January 2000
issue to confirm what engine they were running.  I was under the impression
they were running the same engine as I am - a 1776 with 110 cam and stock
heads.   Can anyone reference the ariticle for me because I've misplaced
that issue?  I'm wondering if this venturi mod is best suited for engines
with more flow/higher displacement.  It wouldn't seem like it to me but you
never know.  Thanks for the help...

Erin
