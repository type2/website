Hi Wilder,
Have heard of some volks who install thin foam strips with one side sticky 
tape onto each underside of the louvre glass pieces to seal them with the 
lower pane.  Have also seen emails posted about replacing the inner screens 
with a kind of home made storm window.  Check out the type2 archives or maybe 
the library for more info!  :)  Eric&amp;Barb
