Subject: My city: The disaster area.

Yes, I do live in a disaster area now.  Its official even.  We had a 
NASTY storm last night.  Us and all of our neighboring cities.  No 
tornados that I know of, but some serious winds.  Might as well have 
been a tornado, less damage overall, but more damage in one area.  There 
is a lot of damage everywhere here.  Trees uprooted throughout the 
cities, cars flipped, boats flipped/sunk, cars and houses crushed by 
trees, thousands still without power, etc etc.  I spent the day hacking 
down trees with a chainsaw, and just got power back last night.  My 
neighbors tree fell into the road blocking it off and landed on the guys 
car across the street, and my bus was parked right in front of his car. 
  *THAT* was close!!!  Stella is one tough bus, she lived through the 
hail storm last year unscathed too while other cars looked like some 
drunk went after them with a ballpein hammer.

Did we make the national news here in WI?  It was pretty crazy here...

On a more busworthy note, the buses are unscathed but I'm not sure about 
my 412 that was out in the country in storage.  I have a bad feeling 
about it and the pole shed it was living in.

I'm happy I put new wipers on the bus with all that rain we got!  First 
time I bought new wipers for it since I owned it, those things had to be 
5-7 years old.

Buses run great through water too.  Parts of the town were flooded and I 
took the bus right through in some water even, a foot (of water) or so 
on my way home.  Driving over trees and power lines and all that, I felt 
like I was driving through a movie.  Its strange to drive through a big 
city at night and its as dark as the country is, for lack of power.  I 
even had trouble finding a place to get gas yesterday!

I took pictures.

Damn it feels like Friday here.
Hope you guys all had fun this past weekend.  Sorry about your 
non-appearance Robert, but that sort of thing happens.  Don't sweat it.
