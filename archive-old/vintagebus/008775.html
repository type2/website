&gt; Someone in this thread mentioned a different way of setting the valves
&gt; which involved less turning of the engine.  Has anyone tried this
&gt; method and then checked the results using the &quot;traditional&quot; method?  I
&gt; wonder if the base circle of the cam is really that round?
&gt;

An even easier way to adjust valves:
Turn engine in direction of rotation. When exhaust valve JUST starts to
open, adjust intake. Rotate engine, watch exhaust open then close, watch
intake open then close. JUST as the intake closes, adjust the exhaust.
Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. Takes longer to R + R valve covers than
to adjust. Don't need to watch dist. rotor or timing mark.
