Subject: Speedbleeders for buses?

Hey all - on the vintagvw list, they've been talking about these
speedbleeders you can get for your bugs.  www.speedbleeder_dot_com
It really looks like a neat gizmo to have and I'd like to get set but I
didn't see anything listed for a pre-71 buses.  Does anyone know the
measurements off hand so I can submit them and see if they have something
that would work?  Doing brake bleeding always has seemed like a PITA to me
so anything to make it easier (and safer) I'm game for it.
