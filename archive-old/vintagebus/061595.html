Subject: Re: [VB] red/blue flasher 9 pin unit

Correct me if I'm wrong, but is't that how it's *supposed* to work?  The
turn signal and brake circuit use the same bulb in the rear.  When you
press the brake, both should light up.  With the brake on and the signal
on, one light should be lit constantly and one should flash.  What did I miss?

&gt;I've reconfirmed my wires with the diagram. My black/red wire running from
&gt;my brake light switch goes to the red flasher (49a) and the other B/R wire
&gt;goes to my fuse panel. When I hold the brake pedal down, it powers my turn
&gt;signal lights to burn (not flashing). Of course, the turn signal wires are
&gt;connected to the red flasher (riveted 49a) and the turns are grounded to the
&gt;front panel by the turn signal frame (not by wiring). Oh - and my
&gt;black/violet is also connected to red flasher (49a). Do I need to jerry-rig
&gt;a ground from my turns? Do I have an extra ground somewhere? Obviously I'm
&gt;powering my turns with my brake pedal!
&gt;
&gt;Final note:  I have no other electrical problems. Parking, headlights, dash
&gt;lights, brake lights, emergency flasher, turn signals work properly.
