Subject: 61 DC front door follow-up

Thanks to all who emailed with the front door info for
my 61.  

An additional question.  Let's assume that my 61
should have the recessed doors.  (Have not checked the
VIN yet to tell)  Will the flat door work?  What would
have to be changed or updated?  I do not relish the
thought of having to try and find an affordable rust
free door again.

Thanks

Matt
