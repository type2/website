NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER buy an engine from
MOFOCO.  NEVER!!!!
I know of multiple dead engines of theirs.  I am currently fixing a bus that had a
bad mofoco motor.  1st motor blew after 80 miles... the 2nd one blew after 170
miles...and they put EVERYTHING together.  Absolute JUNK.
So...I'm putting in a brand new mexican motor.  What ever you do...don't buy from
MOFOCO.  You should see all of the anti-mofoco propaganda at THEIR show!!  An
airplane flew over the track a few weeks ago at the show and dropped off some
grocery bags full of brightly colored pieces of paper that had multiple uses of
profanity involving mofoco.  Another person in town I know...is currently
suffering from a blown MOFOCO motor that was in their thing.  They ordered a 1776
and got an 1835 and a bunch of other stuff they didn't want.
Customer service... they have no clue what that is.  There is NO warranty on
ANYTHING they sell.  NOTHING.

Sorry...but once I get started.
I'm from WI...so I see a lot of MOFOCO crap.  We burn MOFOCO cases here.
