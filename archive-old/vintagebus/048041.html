Hi Thom,
Actually rain is not a factor causing interior rust due to foam unless the 
bus has leaky window seals or roof hatches.  It is more of how cool it gets 
and the humidity levels.  Especially if the bus is used often in weather 
cooler than the inside of the bus.
    A year or so ago we got a Pmail from a nice gal who upon reading our info 
on not using foam rubber as insulation, went out to her bus and looked under 
the foam rubber she had installed over the engine compartment in the rear of 
her bus.  Finding the moisture in the foam rubber and the rust monster 
beginning to chew on her otherwise near rust free bus!   She was living in 
San Diego (Anyone want to tell us how often it rains down there?) where it 
certainly does not rain more than a month or two there.  She thanked us for 
providing info that made her take a look!
   We have also camped in our panel in temps down to and below freezing.  
Ever wake up and see 1/8&quot; thick coating of ice on your bus ceiling?  This 
while camping overnight up in Eureka Nevada where it certainly hardly rains!
   Even if one lives in a very hot and dry all the time climate, can one say 
that they might not have to move to a cooler and perhaps wetter climate 
sometime in the future?  If not themselfs how about thier bus?  If they sell 
it, have they booby-traped it so the rust will work it's magic and have to be 
dealt with by the next owner.  After the problem shows itself, will it be too 
late for the new owner to fix?
   The 1963 non-walk thru panel we have was once a camper conversion of some 
type and was once sold by a Arizona VW dealer who's sticker is on the engine 
lid.  Due to the roof rust especially just above the rain gutter caused by 
foam rubber we will have to replace the roof from just behind the front seats 
all the way to the rear hatch!  The inside of the roof over the front seats 
is still perfect!  Due to no foam rubber having been installed up there.
