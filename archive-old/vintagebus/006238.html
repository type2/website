AND 67 rear splash pans are one-year-only. The bolt hole in the body is
about 1'' off from 66 and back splash pans. What RMMW sells as 55 to 67 is
actually 55 to 66.......

&gt; The trick to the splash pans is to figgure out which
&gt; side they go on. Its pretty much bolt on from there.
&gt; The easiest way to do this is to remove your rear
&gt; bumper and brackets from the bus. ie, remove the whole
&gt; assembly. Then lay out one pan at a time in the
&gt; corners of the bumper. The splash pans bolt to the
&gt; side of the bumper, the side of the bus and to the
&gt; bumper bracket. It's easy to tell which side is which
&gt; by how the pan attaches to the bumper bracket. There
&gt; is an indentation on the pan that fits snug on the
&gt; bracket. Pick up some metric bolts at the hardware
&gt; store and secure them snug. Let me know if you need
&gt; pictures, for I currently have my bumper off.
&gt; ============================================================
&gt;
&gt; This is all true, but make sure they are not bent or have been
modified...or are bay window ones.  If you've never seen the correct ones
before its easy to be fooled.  Best to have some pictures to compare them
to.  I've seen many baywindow pans being sold as &quot;correct&quot; for splits
busses.
