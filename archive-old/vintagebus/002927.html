Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for other double door walkthru owners

Hi,

After I sent that message, I just knew it would stir things
up a little. I have a 64 DD non-walk thru with part of a
camper in it. I did some remodeling about 20 years ago. My
Dad purchased it new from Wes Behel VW in Sunnyvale, CA and
we drove it home the day before my 10th birthday on George
Washington's birthday. (now you know my age)  Happy 36th
birthday to the bus too. I have had the bus since 72.

I am now in the process of fixing it. I would like to find a
passenger door pillar from the upper hinge on down. Have any
leads?

Chris

&gt; &gt;Are you sure that it wasn't modified from non-walk thru?
&gt; Yours is the first I have ever heard of.  I have had a DD
&gt; for the last 27 years. I am always looking at DD's when I
&gt; can find one.

&gt; What year is your double door?
&gt;
&gt; We have now had our 59 double door walk-thru panel for
alost (fruedian slip)
&gt; a month, picked it up on 27 jan.  It is truely a factory
walk-thru. M code
&gt; 183 indicates the walk-thru.  It is easy to pick out a
walk-thru panel as it
&gt; does not have the upper rear vents over the engine
intakes.
