Hi Jason...$30-$35 each is a pretty fair going price for these...a
couple years back they were not reproduced for a short while and they
were really expensive if you could even find them.  I recall that they
were upwards of $50 each for German.

As far as my experience goes with the rebuild kits...it just is not
worth it...they we usually leak do to pits in the old cylinder housing
even after proper honing...leaks will ruin your new brake shoes, plus
might kill you in an accident in the process.  

Don't take a chance with your life or anyone else's.  By nice new brake
components all around for your bus.  Try to save money on other areas of
the bus, like paint or cosmetics...someting that won't kill you if they
fail. 

Go for the nice new brake components!!

&gt; Hey, anybody know wher I can find the 55-63 front wheel cylinders (part
&gt; #211 611 069/070) for less than the usual $30-$35? Are there any rebuild
&gt; kits for these things? What is the part number if so, and where can I get
&gt; these if I need them? Just a few questions I know somebody else is
&gt; wondering about too.
