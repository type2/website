Subject: RE: [VB] FW: interesting bus part

I agree; I would not want to drive around with one of those things.

...however it would be way cool to hook on the back of the bus if you were
into tailgating at football games (or my new fantasy; driving around to
baseball parks in a bus recreating the mastercard comercial)

Hi Adrian,
Yes.  Porsche, K. Ghia and even the bug had versions of this.  This bus one
is just a stupid modern rip off of this.  Why stupid?  It will just need to
get tapped once to cause wonderfull amount of rear body damage!   Eric&amp;Barb
