I'm kind of surprised about all these people who say that Dr. Joe's towbar
is no good.  I towed my bus all the way from Falls City, NE to here (90
miles) at 60mph with no problems.  People's fears about the muffler clamps
seem odd to me because I really torque the heck out of the clamps and have
never had them go sliding around on me.  I can see how there might need to
be some reinforcement added on around the little fingers that slide up on
the beam but I really like my towbar and haven't had any of the problems
that have been mentioned.  Plus, anyone who travels freeway speeds with an
old bus in tow is just asking for trouble no matter how they tow it short of
using a trailer.
