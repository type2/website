Craig,

Yep!  Been watching and recording it.  Don't remember what the s/c went 
for, but seems like about 40k+.

If the announcers could just get a clue about VW's we would be in 
business!  They can tell you that a paper tag is missing from the right 
front inside fender on an &quot;original&quot; 67 hemi cuda, but can't tell you 
didly about the VW's they showed.

Their discussion of the one bug I have seen go thru the line was pathetic, 
except that it had every NOS accesory on it that was available.

Cheers, dave

 other was a 68 - listed as beige, but looked fridge white to me. 
 under a tarp, so hard to tell.  a few pretty bugs, but nothing really 
 jumped at me. i've seen cars i'd rather have at the phoenix bug-in, 
 and they DROVE there...........
