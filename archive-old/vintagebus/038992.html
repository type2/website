The list filter caught me forgetting to delete quotes, so I'm resending my note to the guy who is stuck in MO with tranny problems. If you're nearby, maybe you can help.

I'm guessing that you're heading west. I'm betting that it will be cheaper and quicker for you to find a good rear end and do a swap. Don't know if you've ever done that before, but it's not all that tricky. 

Pull the engine. (floor jack)
Support the back of the bus so it doesn't fall on you.
(well-placed jack stands)
Unbolt the shifter linkage in front of tranny.
Support tranny/redux box assy. (floor jack in center of tranny)
Unbolt the redux boxes.
Unbolt the tranny mounts.
Pull tranny.

Reverse process to install new, good tranny.

My guess is that SOMEONE in KC or maybe closer has a good tranny/redux box that they'd sell reasonable. Anyone?

Whole thing can be done in a day even if you've never done it. You won't be going for parts after you pull the engine, so make sure you have good/new tranny mounts, engine oil, tranny oil, etc.

As for AAA, I've heard of members getting a tow, drop off, call again, tow, drop off, call again...I think that's cheating and I don't cheat. I also don't define morality for others. I also don't have AAA. ;)
...but I do have spare parts.

Thanks! Joe
