They are sending em out. As a matter of fact I got
mine today, I bet you get yours tomorrow. Are you up
to date on your dues? The best thing to do is to mail
Dave and let him know. And on another NEATO note, I am
working with Dean and Todd to get some bus activity
going on around here. Was thinking of getting monthly
chapter meetings back at Pescados.
