A &quot;doghouse&quot; is a type of shroud, used on the '71 and later bugs that used
the offset cooler.  The cooler is actually outside of the fan shroud in the
back, with a small duct to direct air to it.  Previously, the cooler was
*inside* the shroud, which made the left side of the engine run hot.

Chrome ones are usually aftermarket, and are usually don't have the correct
ducting inside, as well a being a royal pain to fit.

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but you must phrase that in the form of a question.
