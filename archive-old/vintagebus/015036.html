It wasn't a post about a missing title which got him removed.  It was
instigating and sustaining a nasty flame war with the other individual
involved in the transaction.  After the first shots, I sent them both 
warnings, but the venom continued to flow, so I pulled them both.
I didn't see any good that would come of them flaming each other to death in
front of a live studio audience.    A flame war certainly wasn't going
to cause a title to coalesce out of the ether...

People keep thinking this list is a democracy; it's not.
Consider it a benevolent dictatorship.

If you really want to have a knock-down, drag-out flame war, take it to 
RAMVA or VintagVW, neither of which are moderated.  You can go thermonuclear,
get 100 or so other people in on the dogpile.  The only limitations
are your imagination and bandwidth.  Bring your Nomex, 'cause they
don't take American Express.

But not here.  Myself, Steve, Ken and the type2 list Moderating Junta try 
to keep things as bus-centric as possible.

Thanks for your understanding in these matters.

&gt; By the way....in case you don't already know it...his posts to the
&gt; vintagebus list re:said title or lack of.._dot_caused him to be removed from
&gt; that list.  Something I strongly felt should not have happened!
