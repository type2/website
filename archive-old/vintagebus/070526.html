I just got back from Iraq.  Told my CO that I had a bus show to go to
and he sent me home.....well it didn't really go just like that but I
will be there none the less.

Subject: [VB] Bulli Brigade in Tampa - Role Call


Anyone headed to Tampa this weekend for the Bulli Brigade and Bug Jam?

I am finally going!  Long overdue really.

The bad part is that I will be in a buddys '71 Westi and not my '66
Westi :( 
  Thought I would have the new rearend in so I could make it with IRS
and 
944 rear discs, but alas no dice.

Maybe next week some cool photos of a completed full 944 brake system.

See ya'll in sunny Tampa,
Adrian Pillow
