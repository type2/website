&lt;&lt; An other question !  I found a working radio in an old (RUSTY) '65.
 
 Can I fit this in my '67.  I guess i'll need a front cover.  Does anyone
 know where I can find this ?&gt;&gt;
 
 Hi Gunther,
It is from a 1965 bus right?  If your bus is a 1967 it should have the large
radio hole in the dash that only the 1958-67 bug and 1967 K. Ghia radio will
fit.  Also is the radio 6 volt or 12 volt and what voltage is your bus?   Eric
