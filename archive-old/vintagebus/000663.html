My cousin just bought a bus, and beat me to it to get it. It is a '59 Kombi 
that needs a lot of work though. He wants to be on the list, but he is still 
in the days when barndoors could be bought new and doesn't have a computer. 
Anyway, his pan is really rusty but surprisingly doesn't have any holes. I 
have read about almost everybody using por-15 when they need to take care of 
rust. Problem is, I never paid enough attention to learn how to use it. So 
how do you use it? What is the prep-work? What does it even do? These may 
seem like dumb questions, but if you tell me I can make him think I know more 
than him and give him a solution to his pan problem. Thanks for any 
responses!!! :-)
