There's a guy called Kimm Garland who runs
a shop called Indian Automotive here in Aus who
makes the bits for this very conversion.  You can
put the post 67 IRS tranny in and you don't have to cut the forks.
You can return the bus to stock 'reasonably' easily if
you want to and the design has some nice features
for adjusting wheel alignment and camber.  Height it really
your choice from stock to low.

Price would not be that bad for someone in the US at the
moment given the weak Aussie dollar.  You can find pix
and description on his page at

&gt; If you really want to see a really clean IRS bus conversion come to BBB V
&gt; and see Matts 60 DD conversion. This conversion used the 68 type 2
trailing
&gt; arms and components. I was told by someone that the 68 only type 2 spring
&gt; plates will fit right on a split, the only thing you need to do is weld
in
&gt; the pivot points for the arms. This was done by cutting into the forks
and
&gt; boxing them in at the torsion housing, then weld in the pivots in the
boxed
&gt; sections. His bus rides at stock height and now has the options of
numerous
&gt; transmission and gear choices, also the strength of the late bay
suspension.
&gt; If I get his bus back up on the hoist in the shop I will photograph this
&gt; conversion and post it somewhere on the net.
