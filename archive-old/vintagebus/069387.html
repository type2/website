&gt;Do you know if the size wiring going from the battery to the headlights
&gt;is technically of big enough diameter for 100W 12 volt bulbs?

Short answer #1 is &quot;It depends.&quot;
Short answer #2 is &quot;You can probably get away with it but it might not
be the best idea.&quot;

The long answer is:  Picking a wire size depends on a lot of things,
including the load, the allowable voltage drop, the duty cycle of the
load, the presence and type of insulation, the wire material, cost,
weight, whether the wire is in free air, or a harness, or in conduit,
and more.

You can take some hints from the original VW design.  The 6 V sealed
beams are rated at 40 W / 6.20 V and 50 W / 6.10 V.  This corresponds
to a current for both bulbs of 12.9 A on low beam and 16.4 A on high
beam.  In 1967, the system voltage changed to 12 V, halving all currents,
but the wire sizes didn't change.  Loading the wires with the same
current but at 12.8 V (the rated voltage of the stock 12 V sealed
beams) would say you could run 210 watts of high beam (105 W per
bulb) and 165 watts of low beam (82.5 W per bulb).

On the other hand, page E-16 6 of the '63-'67 Bentley reprint talks
about hooking up &quot;quartz iodine lights&quot; (I'm pretty sure they're
talking about halogens [0]) of 55 W each.  They recommend not running
the fog lights and low beams at the same time, and not running the
stock and halogen high beams at the same time.  This implies that
they thought another 110 W of load wasn't a good idea.

Page 792 of the Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th edition, talks about
calculating conductor sizes.  They recommend a maximum voltage drop
of 0.3 V from terminal 30 of the light switch to the headlamps, and
a maximum voltage drop of 0.6 V in the entire positive side of the
headlamp circuit.

Assuming that the headlamp switch, dimmer switch, and fuses are perfect
(no resistance), we can come up with the following.  Let's further assume
that there is 1 m total of wire from the headlight switch to the dimmer
switch and from the dimmer switch to the fuse box.  100W H4s are rated
at 12.0 V nominal, or 16.7 A for two bulbs.  Per the tables in the
Handbook, this requires a 1.5 mm^2 wire, and yields 0.21 V voltage drop
in that wire.

We only have 0.09 V left to spend in getting the current from the fuse
box to the headlamps.  Let's assume there is 0.5 m of wire from the
fuse box to each headlamp, and each wire is carrying 8.33 A.  Per the
Handbook, this requires 1.0 mm^2 wire, yielding an 0.077 V voltage drop
in each wire.

We've got 0.3 V left to spend on the red wire from the starter solenoid
to the headlamp switch.  Let's assume it's only carrying the headlamp
current of 16.7 A and is 3 m long.  Per the Handbook, this requires a
4.0 mm^2 wire, yielding an 0.27 V voltage drop.

So, overall, we have about a 0.56 V voltage drop from the starter to
the headlights.  Remember, though, that this assumes that the headlamp
switch, dimmer switch, fuse box connections, and fuses are absolutely
perfect - zero voltage drop.  If you assume that the headlamp switch,
dimmer switch, and trips through the fuse box cost 0.05 V each, the
wire sizes go up: headlight switch to dimmer and fuse is 2.5 mm^2,
and the fuse box to headlamps is 4 mm^2.  The red wire from front to
back is still 4.0 mm^2.  If the switches and fuses get worse, the wire
will need to be thicker yet.  Also, the red wire from back to front
is powering _everything_, not just the headlights.

To sum up: Back in the day, VW didn't recommend an extra load that big.
With perfect, just-rolled-out-of-Hanover wiring, it's probably OK.  With
35+ year old wiring, maybe not.

[0] Just think, if you bought a new Type III (fuel injection) in 1968
and fitted &quot;quartz iodine&quot; (halogen) headlamps, it would only take 17
or so years for Detroit's standard offerings to catch up...
