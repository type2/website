&lt;&lt;  I have always got senders that when installed oiltight have 4 or 5 
milimetres of thread showing between the boss and the case.  &gt;&gt;

This is because the threads on these puppies are a tapered pipe thread.  DO 
NOT overtighten, just snug them up to the point they don't leak.  You could 
use teflon tape, but then they are easier to overtighten to the point that 
they crack the case!
Be careful with these, no sense having to get a case welded.
