10 highroofs?  Dman!

That seems to be a common theme _at_ shows these days - organizational problems.

Kelly Park: not enuf space, randomness of swap and car parking 
Sac Bug-O-Rama: event workers looked downright surprised when cars showed up
for the show area.  And why do they make the cars entering the show drive
all the way around and thru the DIRT, and the vendors drive on the paved road?
Classic: gate workers seemed *really* slow...

&gt; The organazation/layout of the show was terrible (as to be expect from the 
&gt; golden gate chapter).
&gt; I suppose they have another 2 years to get their act together.
&gt; Did ANYONE have a good time there?
