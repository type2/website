Subject: RE: [VB] another example of why you should DIY (long)

I feel your pain,
I spent 25 years doing my own work. It was the last year that I decided that
my bones didn't feel like climbing underneath and so I allowed someone local
who was said to be trusted. I won't go into the horror story here, just be
aware that when I got it home it was running extra hot and not free wheeling
like it should rolling down the road in nuetral. Turns out the brakes were
too tight and the valves, timing and carb were way out of adjustment. I blew
my stack and then calmly dialed the number to the local wrench jock and
invited him over to have a look at his handywork. After jacking it up and
trying to spin the tires, he was convinced his adjustment was a &quot;tad&quot; tight.
I fired up the engine for him and showed how bad it ran hot and explained to
him about valve lash, timing and carb adjustment at correct oil temp. I
didn't expect any money back and I didn't get any, but I did get an offer to
help train his helper in his shop on how to tune VW's. I think I will accept
that offer. I know that I can and will do my own work from now on, but there
are a lot of people who can't or won't learn, so we still need knowledgable
mechanics around to help them out, not bumb them out on owning dubs.

hey folks,
here's a bit of a horror story for ya. i brought my
bus into the local shop here in minneapolis at 
begining of last week to get a bunch f miscellaneous
work done. it was little stuff (new generator, adjust
brakes, oil change, valve adjust, vent latches, heat,
etc..) i could have done myself but didn't have the
time/warm garage to do it. so i told him to go one
thing at a time according to my list of importance
since i was on a budget (i.e. - do one thing. call me
with estimate. repeat.) i called him on wednesday to
see how things were going and he was almost done with
everything! 

i stopped by that night to check out the work he'd
done. everything looked good, however, we were already
twice over my budget. i told him to finish up what he
was working on and i'd pick it up on friday.

i picked it up. the bill was $1200! i swallowed it and
brought the bus home. it sat all weekend as i went out
of town. on sunday night i got back and desperately
wanted to drive something else besides the golf so i
hopped into the bus and headed for my girlfriend's
house. about 5 milesfrom home i heard my belt snap and
figured i'd just drive it home and park it since it
was cold and i hadn't gotten far. that was until i
smelt an electrical fire coming from the back of my
smoking bus.

so i pulled over and jumped out with my fire
extinguisher. and to my suprise found no fire. i did,
however find some live wire that would have given me a
good shock had i not had gloves on. so i got it towed
back to the shop after disconnecting the ground cable
on the battery and called my roommate to pick me up. i
called there today and he said it's fixed and
everything works. i guess a loose wire got caught on
the generator shaft and wrapped itself accordingly.
hence the belt snapping and the electrical fire smell.
the shop fixed it for free and everything is well now,
but i could have been the proud owner of a 2000lb
marshmallow with an extra rare elevating roof. that's
it. i'm moving to aridzona where i can work on my bus
year round. 

most sincerely,
casey
