Subject: Re: [VB] My 67 project

Eye protection, gloves, proper ventilation. You know, I never think to
mention them because it always seems to be part of the job, but I guess
there are some that may not. Thanks Clara

I always try to stress the safety rules.
There are lots of young people working on old busses.
Many are anxious to get their projects done and many are on a budget.
You know your budget is shot when you have to go to Hospital Emergency
and drop $800.00 just to see a doctor.
It works out to be both financial and health wise better to consider
safety in every situation.
