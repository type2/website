         Yes and no, I've done it both ways.  But that little voice in my 
head, used to tell me sooner or later I'm gonna screw up an oil cooler one of 
these days moving around the fan shroud.  But after you pull your engine a 
couple of times, you just get faster at it.  With practice I think you'll 
find it saves you time in the long run pulling the engine, plus it give you 
the opportunity to clean things up and just give things a good look.  I used 
to run a clutch special back when I was physically able, engine out, replace 
the clutch, engine back in, in about an hour with a 10 minute break.  
         I had a flywheel seal go bad last week on my bay, my co-workers were 
just amazed that I had replaced a 3 dollar part in one evenings time and 
drove to work the next morning.  Not bad time for a person with my physical 
limitations!!  And my friends wonder why I drive only Volkswagens!! :)
                                                                              
                 Peace,
