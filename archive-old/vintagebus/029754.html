&gt;I understand about the floors - I'm thinking of applying the same treatment
[drilling drain holes] to the low spots in the front floors, giving the
water a path all the way out of the car.
&gt;
I've been planning to install a 2&quot; flexible pipe through my bench seat bottom
that drains straight down through the floor, less bathroom stops...

;)

Wait, make that 3&quot;.

Also a tube from the valve of my spare tire so I can breathe underwater
(for CA trips).
