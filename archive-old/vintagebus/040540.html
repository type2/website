Hello Everyone,

Finally got enough money saved to buy some tires for my bus.  I ended up 
going with Pathfinder 205/75/15 from Discount Tire Co.  They look nice.  I 
have no motor in my bus as of yet, because I want to finish off the body 
work before I begin tackling mechanicals.  Most of the welding in of 
new/salvaged panels is done, I mainly need to do some grinding of weld 
seams, and some heat shrinking where some of the panels warped due to heat 
from the MIG welder I have been using.  I want to move my bus from my house 
to the local high school where I can work on it at their shop once a week.  
The instructor is much better at heat shrinking than I am, and I don't want 
to mess up what I've done so far!

I've been talking to my VWFLAPS, and there is a guy locally that can build 
me a bus (not a refitted bug one, but built from the ground up for a bus) 
tow bar for $80.00.  I've never priced tow bars before, is this a good 
price?  Exploring alternatives, does anyone know how much it costs to rent a 
tow dolly for a day, or to buy a tow dolly?

Thanks!
