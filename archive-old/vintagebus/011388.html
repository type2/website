&gt; I

special)

no

&gt; stands and oil fillers.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, I want to get rid of some of this stuff! I am this
close 
&gt; to scrapping it all at the metal recycler. Anyone want any of this 
&gt; stuff? Carbs, and distributers as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any value or is it all just old stuff? Nothing vintage or 
&gt; special, just old vw motor stuff taking up space.

My father talks about the days when he could buy a good running Model
A Ford for $20, _IF_ it didn't have any dents!  Now an original
radiator alone runs close to $500!

Prices go up for just about every part once the vehicle reaches voting
age.  Right now, VW parts are about as cheap as they will ever be, and
the prices will go up.  Moreover, a lot of the &quot;discardable&quot; stock
parts will become even more rare.  I think that the original Solex
carbs and the original tin will become quite valuable as more people
turn toward restoration rather than &quot;way kewl&quot; customs.  I'd much
rather have an original Solex 30PICT-1 than the Bocar &quot;does
everything&quot; PICT-31, even if I have to have it rebushed.

In short, decide if the future value of the parts is worth the space
they are taking up.  If so, keep 'em.  If not, give them to someone
who wants them [not the scrap metal guy :0  ]
