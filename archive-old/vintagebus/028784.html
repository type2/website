A washer on the oil sending unit??  Hmmmm.  I always thought the bore of the
hole was tapered.  I was told this is why you never are supposed to tighten
the unit down to the base...you'll crack the case.  How would a washer work if
you're not supposed to tighten the unit down???    That is if the hole really
is tapered.
