&gt; People who put flash intros on sites - especially with no 'out' -
&gt; need to be take out and shot.  Then drawn and quartered whent here's
&gt; no actual content beyond the intro.

I agree.  I have a feeling that Gabe took the word of some script kiddie
that he'd have a slammin' good site in a week.

I'm getting plenty PO'd at folks who assume that everyone has a fast
connection and wants to constantly screw up their computers with the
latest download of various web &quot;enhancers&quot;.  Pleh.

In fact, the only halfway decent use for flash I've found is the Bus
Selecta.
