I guess you've never seen my DD, I drive it every day 7 days a week, at the
swaps it's loaded to the hilt inside and out and I also pull a trailer full
of parts, 30,000 miles on it since last June, YES I do drive them, 100 plus
weather hasn't stopped me, the feel of hot air on my head from the fan hung
from the overhead airbox and all. Go to Pomona, a lot of people drive there
buses full of parts there, but I am one that does drive the distance for it
600 miles R/T. When I had more then one I rotated the stock, now that I'm
down to one driver it's time to get the 59 single cab going, I am doing this
SHOW (ha ha ) quality, but a good paint job on a perfectly strait bus makes
it easy. Am I afraid to drive it in case I get in a wreck NO, that's what
insurance is for. Replace my DD or single cab if wrecked, very possible,
what about those new SUV's, $30,000 plus, cost a hell of a lot more then the
perfect bus, but I prefer my buses and before that I drove vintage 356's a
lot more valuable then any of my buses, even wrecked one once, big deal,
fixed it continued driving it (daily) and this was in Orange County Cal.
bumper to bumper inconsiderate drivers, still didn't stop me, if you got it
drive it, insure it for what it's worth just like those new cars, if you
wreck it replace it. 

ronnie &quot;not afraid to drive&quot; old volks

 ps. when I make a good tow bus I'll use it instead of my F#%d

hi all,

I have noticed a recent trend lately... Everyone is driving cars other
than busses it would seem.

Have we moved into a new era where busses are for shows and garages and
other cars are for driving?

Some of the greats in bus-lore have jumped ship...

Trailering Barndoors that run fine to VW shows...
Buying mercedes diesel wagons to attend VW shows
A local bus-nazi preferring to drive to a vw event in a pontaic over his
bug..
fewr and fewer swap space participants showing up with busloads of parts,
more and more showing up with US made pickups of parts.

and the list goes on...

Am i cracked for only having busses to drive, have i lost my reason...
should i check into a rehab program now that i have finally sold my only
running watercooled car? (though i must admit to still having one that
doesnt work.. as it stands i have 1 WC, 2 split, 1 bay, 2 vgons, only the 
71 and 61 run.)

I know it cant be due to parts availability as most anything we could need
is readily available.  It cant be due to expense, as acvw parts are still
the cheapest thing going. (even one taillight for a new car is more than a
nice pair for my 61)  And i'd even doubt its due to rarity of busses, i
see plenty FS cheap that no-one picks up...

Help me to figure this one out...

thanks,

Steve

p.s. i _think_ this is a non-friday topic, if i am wrong please let me
know.
