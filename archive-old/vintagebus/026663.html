Subject: RE: [VB] 30 Pict-2 Question
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 132.233.247.5

&gt;Can anyone on the list can tell me whether all 30 Pict-2 carbs (as fitted
to my 1500 SP) should have an idle cut-off valve? (mine doesn't).  If so,
could this explain (at least partly!) my buses reluctance to idle? (have
checked for air leaks, set valves, timing, etc).  At the moment there is a
pilot jet in the hole where the idle cut-off valve would go.  It may be that
this is correct for some 30 Pict-2's, and I should just leave it alone and
try something else(!), but I would be grateful if
anyone on the list can offer any insight.
&gt;
1. The idle cutoff is to prevent run-on after you shut your Bus off.
2. Yes, it should have an idle cutoff but someone could have replaced it
with a non-electric jet, they are available, i've used them on Type 3s a
lot.  It has a little ball bearing in there to perform the same action.
3. Maybe it has a jet of the incorrect size in there, affecting your idle?
4. A 6v cutoff valve will break on a 12v system.

Good luck,
Everett Barnes
