Hi Volks,
Our bus parts manual up to 1967 and our 1968-about 74 bus shop manual both 
have the same part number for the front bow (261 871 061) and rear bow (261 
871 065).  So it really looks like they are the same parts and thusly hieght. 
 Otherwise this would have caused much angst for part managers to order the 
correct parts for the SCs.  Of course there is always a chance for special 
order parts or dealer/owner modified.   Eric&amp;Barb
