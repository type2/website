LIKE THE TITLE SAYS CONGRATS TO THOM.I picked up the MARCH 2000 HOT VWS,and 
guess whos bus i seen from the bug-o-rama  MR. THOM'S.It is on page 66 of 
the issue.See even talking trash about these mags and saying he would 
probably never be in one and damn if a couple of months later he is in 
one.Kind of ironic isnt it,lol.
But anyway congrats THOM in making into HOT VWS.Hope to see all of you in 
there oneday.
