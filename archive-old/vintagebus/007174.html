Subject: 67 Bus - Front Beam Removal
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2000 22:25:56 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Tonight the front beam was removed from the 67 bus.  I had Shawn Weakland
and Ryan Roberts (a couple of teenage friends of mine in 9th and 8th grade
respectively) helping out.  They are majorly hyped on this bus project
because when its roadworthy, we're all piling in it and heading to
Bloomington, MN to the Mall of America to Legoland.  I really like to see a
couple of guys at that age who are so enthusiastic about a project and
willing to work so hard for a desired goal.  That's a good lesson to learn
and it's great that they enjoy it.

Moving along, about 7:30 we showed up at the grandparent's shop and fired up
the compressor.  Shawn and Ryan went right for the emergency brake cables
and removed them from the lever.  I managed to remove the clutch cable, drag
link (which came off really easy with the impact pickle fork), front part of
the shift rod, and brake lines.  Shawn and Ryan also took care of the gear
shifter removal.  Removing the shocks to get to the 2 rear most axle beam
bolts was a pain in the rear because the impact wrench wouldn't bust loose
the upper bolt on the left side.  I ended up doing it by hand.  It was
rusted pretty darn good but it finally came off.  We positioned the jack and
a board under the beam in the center and I zipped off the 4 bolts on each
side that secured the axle beam to the bus.  It took a lot of tapping,
rocking, and coaxing but we finally got that front beam off.  Next the dust
caps came off, steering dampener removed, axle nuts and drums were also
removed.  Since the cotter keys on the castellated nuts were rusted so thin
that they kept breaking off, we just impacted the tie rod securing nuts off,
and pickle forked them out of the holes.  Everything we've removed that
could accidentally be assembled backwards or just plain wrong has been
center punched with reference marks.

After surmising everything we did tonight, I was quite impressed that we did
all of this in about an hour and half total. I'm now going over what I need
to order for this beam.   The swing lever bushing is going to need replacing
as well as all the tie rod ends.  Brake drums need turning and there is TONS
of cleaning that needs to be done but we're getting there bit by bit.
Tomorrow the steering box comes out, MC, and everything that can be removed
for cleaning, repairing, and painting.  Even my friends have volunteered to
run the drills with the wire wheels to get all the dirt, rust, and scale
cleaned up so we can totally por15 the front underside of the bus to keep
rust at bay.

More will be posted as progress is made...
