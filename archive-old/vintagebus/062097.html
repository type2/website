Subject: Man that is an old 15&quot; wheel!

I went to the junkyard this weekend scrounging up two 15&quot; wheels.  I had
success which was nice.  Both pretty weathered looking from sitting in the
junkyard for years and God knows where before then.

So yesterday at lunch I went by the local used tire dealer and had them take
the old old crusty tires off the wheels.  No problem.  Then last night I
cleaned them up with a wire wheel and Simple Green, amazingly affective.
After that I shot some primer and paint on them to keep them semi nice (not
perfect at all, but effective).

Now for the cool stuff!  One wheel is date stamped 3-56!  It is stamped &quot;DIN
4 1/2K x 15A   Lemmerz   3/56&quot;  (the 3/56 being in a circle).  It was
originally painted white and I am pretty sure came off a 23 window (which is
dead and gone - was red with white wheels).  Anyway if anyone on this list
who contributes regularly needs this wheel I am happy to trade it for
another good 15&quot; wheel (plus $12 to remount the tire if I have mounted it
already).  I just thought I would offer in case someone needs a perfect date
resto kind of thing.

The next 15&quot; wheel was neat in the fact it had the VW part sticker still in
the tire center channel!  I am not sure if it was a replacement part or
what, but it contained the part number, vendor number, part description
&quot;wheel disc&quot;, quantity &quot;1&quot;, and a few other little things.  Unfortunately I
could not make out all the numbers but it was cool just the same.  It was
not stamped with a Lemmerz signature either or date stamp of any kind.

At the same time I cleaned up an early Porsche 911 wheel which is a 5 1/2J x
15 that was from 7-68 and was stamped with Lemmerz.   

Why the second 15&quot; wheel was not Lemmerz is a mystery to me?

Just sharing some boring information :)
