&gt; what is your new buses vin?   if you have a bus about vin 
&gt; 246xxx to 351xxx, 
&gt; it camw with a flat decklid  (like brakelight decklid but no 
&gt; brakelight 
&gt; there, but not got the hump the later ones did)  with the round glass 
&gt; taillights with separate bezel and screws on outside.   
&gt; sounds like you have 
&gt; the flat decklid.

Haven't got the bus home yet(will fetch it Saturday)so I don't know what the
VIN or MCodes are. Feeling a little silly as I recently got a parts manual
which will answer the questions that I have posed.

Thank you all for the input.

Michael
