Yeah, well a buddy of mine happened to show me the effects of pavement &amp; a 
slammed beetle. Skimmed right over the top of a large dog. All us guys 
couldnt bare the smell to scape it off under there so we made a GIRL do it. 
haha. 

It took months for the smeel to go away because stuff was stuck up in the 
beam.
