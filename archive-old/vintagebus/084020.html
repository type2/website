&gt;&gt;  The only thing I could think of is that the brass disc  is somehow not 
contacting the brass sleeve that the ground wire mounts in, the  top of the 
sleeve looks a little damaged. Has anybody seen this before?   &lt;&lt;



Hi Seth,
Seen that, and lots of corrosion.  You can very carefully take the  horn 
button apart for fixing, cleaning, and dielectric grease to keep the  corrosion 
away.
