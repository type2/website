I got this publication notice in the mail recently, thought some of you might
like to know.


The Velvet Monkey Wrench 
by John Muir
a futurist vision from the past
has been reissued in a 25th anniversary edition.

&quot;It presents a revolutionary plan for reshaping society that is as intriguing
today as when it was first written nearly three decades ago.&quot;

&quot;John Muir is remembered by sixties buffs as the author of HOW TO KEEP YOUR
VOLKSWAGEN ALIVE, which introduced a new concept in user-friendly how-to books
and sold more than two million copies, to become one of the most successful
self-published books in history. He died in Santa Fe New Mexico in 1977.&quot;

isbn: 9662824-0-X
1-19 copies, $20.00 includes postage
