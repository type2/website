Well it all depends.  If it's Grendel you have to cut it off.  I've had
good luck using a big punch on the back side of the drum, where there is a
ridge.  Go round and round to keep it even.  As Thom said, a block of wood
will work in place of a big punch.  I think they usually get rusted up in
the splines.  I'd use Aero Kroil on it, but it seems to be harder to get
now than in the 70s.  Maybe the melted wax trick.  If that doesnt work try
the drum puller.  If the puller doesn't work, try the punch or block of
wood while it's under pressure from the puller.  Don't forget to try the
torch a little too. If nothing works read the Grendel files and be
thankful- at least you're at home.
