late 60s splitty parts list shows 113 141 723 for clutch  operating lever 
return spring from chass no. 469 506 (post split case tranny).  The picture 
looks like spring A

lists 111 141 723A return spring up to chassis no 469 505.   (note 
supercession)

As you see from the first three digits in the p/n s these are parts first 
used on type I.

I also have several different kinds of return springs in my pile of them, and 
wondered, but never worried.  Installed what fits. The brake springs are also 
similar, and none have part numbers on. 

you have a split case trans?  looks to me from the pic that B is like A but 
shorter arms.  The angle of the arms is distinctly different in C.

Clutch springs with arms akimbo.

 I'm putting my engine back in my bug but I believe the process is the same
 for bug and bus and I think this information could be useful to both groups
 (hence the cross post to VintageBus).  I have three clutch return springs.
 All look different.  Check out the picture at
 http://www.mr-vw.4t_dot_com/cgi-bin/i/temp/clutchsprngs.jpg and let me know
 which one(s) is/are for a splitcase tranny.  I know for a fact (I took it
 off an old splitcase) that C is from a splitcase but B looks very close.
 Just thought I would see what ya'll thought.
