Subject: Drip Rail Attach for Big Top Tent Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a Big Top Tent with no floor and plan to use it with my 67 Westy. I 
previosly had an another 67 that was a project beyond my time or money but 
decided to keep the tent and the aluminum railing that goes above the side 
cargo doors. My question to the list is: I have to understand where on the 
railing that attaches to the drip rail are the &quot;S&quot; shaped hooks located. As 
some of you know there are 2 sections of  railing. 1 goes above the right 
rear quarter window where I have 1 &quot;S&quot; hook mounted on the rail at the end 
(Towards the rear) and the other section above the side cargo doors. Well, I 
have 4 &quot;S&quot; shaped hooks all together but I am not really certain about their 
location. Heck! I am not really certain about their pupose. Will also need to 
make an adjustment to a cargo door for clearance of a Hook. If someone has 
this set up, please send me a pix If availalbe. 

Thank you.
