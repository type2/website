&lt;&lt; 1. Where does one measure the fan to determine its width - blades or 
overall
 including the 'ring'?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Between the two discs, which is the same as the blades.

&lt;&lt;2. What is the 'fattest' fan one could fit into a stock doghouse 
shroud/alternator combination without serious mods.&gt;&gt;
You could probably install a 40mm wide fan if someone made one.

&lt;&lt;3. What would the 'fattest' suitable fan have been fitted to originally? &gt;&gt;
Depends on the engine year.  SP seem to have finished with the 29mm and the 
DP used 33-35mm wise fans.  Make sure your spacing between the generator tin 
and the back (FIF) of the fan is .070&quot; or a hair less.   Eric&amp;Barb
