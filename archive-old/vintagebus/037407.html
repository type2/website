There is a certain sound a nice VW motor makes, and each one sings slightly 
differently, but when it is off, as John Muir says, it gives you the 
creepies.  

When the dist sticks, and does not advance, it sounds okay at idle, but when 
you step on the gas, it sounds out of tune.  Like an instrument out of tune.  
And on the flat side.  You can test this theory  by keeping the motor at a 
steady fast rpms with one hand on the carb, and manually twisting the dist 
with the other  to advace the timing.   May be this sounds hokey.    But It 
works.  
Then again its more straightforward tobuy a strobe light, you dont have to 
get the $200 special edition with dials and numbers etc, just get the cheaper 
deal, I got mine years ago.   You hook up the clip to the #1 spark plug wire, 
the red to the + and the black to ground.  Marking TDC on the pulley with 
liquid paper helps.  STart up the motor, point the light at the pulley and 
press the trigger.  Ok- the white liquid paper should show up nice, and show 
where the timing is at idle.   Pull the arm on the carb, and  you should see 
the spark move counterclockwise, to the left .   About 20 to 30 degrees, 
depending on the tye of dist- I think the 009 has about 22* advance (?).  You 
can twist the dist slightly  and see how the timing changes.  pretty cool 
toy.  Get one for X mas.

Hi Clara, (and everybody else too)

Reading your post, something clicked regarding my bus troubles, wanted to

ask your opinion.  Regarding the advance sticking on a bus, I'm assuming

that you're checking the timing with a strobe light to find this problem.  I

don't have one so I've never done it but I'm thinking that maybe this was

the source of the overheating I've been experiencing with my bus.

I do know that when I brought the bus home for the first time, it started to

run really badly somewhere around Montana, stalling and generally running

crappy, but good enough that I just kept going.  (I was by myself and really

wanted to get home)  When I took the bus in to my (aircooled vw) mechanic,

he said that the distributor had been &quot;sticking&quot; and was the source of the

problem.  I guess he'd done something to make it stop sticking; the bus was

now running fine.  He's a crusty old German man so sometimes I don't really

understand what he's saying.

I also know that, in my quest to get the motor to run at less than 220 - 240

degrees, the only thing that seemed to make any difference was retarding the

timing.  If it makes any difference, I'm running a 009 distributor.

The only other thing that makes me suspect the distributor is this nagging

feeling I've been having that I should get a new one.  Now, you may think

that's crazy but I often rely on intuition when fixing the bus and it's

usually been helpful.  For example, this spring in Colorado I had a nagging

bad feeling about the fuel pump.  I suspected that maybe the rubber

diaphragm inside was torn and that it might be leaking into the motor.  So I

bought a new one and went to replace it.  It turned out to be fine

internally, but when I went to take off the fuel line from the gas tank, the

brass fitting pulled right out of the fuel pump quite easily!  Basically it

was a big fire waiting to happen.  Coincidence?  Maybe.

Since I'm currently in the process of taking the motor apart to rebuild it

(for real this time - you may remember that I just replaced the pistons and

cylinders and put on new heads at the beginning of the year, but I didn't

split the case) finding out why it was overheating is a major goal right

now.  I believe that 11 000+ miles worth of extended road trip driving, with

the motor running super hot the whole time, probably caused some of the cam

lobes to self-destruct.  And who knows what other damage.  Presently I've

stalled at the flywheel removal point: I've never done it before.  And it's

freakin' cold outside.  But I digress...

Thoughts, advice, ruminations welcome,

Diana
