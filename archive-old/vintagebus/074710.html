Subject: Warming up a cold engine....

Ok, I've heard several arguments over how to properly warm up your bus when 
starting it cold....  So what is the correct way?  I would assume if I had a 
stock setup with heat risers it would be different or faster than my current 
setup with a bugpack header and dual carbs.  I park on a hill when not in 
hte garage and currently use the start the engine with a few pumps of gas 
and continue out of the driveway.  Others recommend warming the engine prior 
to driving away.  I recently read in the Muir book to not warm it in the 
driveway....
