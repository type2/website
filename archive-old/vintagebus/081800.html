alterations?
Hi Kevin,
Having half your brakes with a dual circuit MC, if you blow out a wheel 
cylinder, flex hose or even a metal brake line is definitely safer!!  Instead of no 
brakes other than the wimpy E-brake with single circuit MC.  The only 
alteration we did was to heat with a large soldering iron a dent in the forward end 
of the rabbit reservior to allow for the beam seam that it otherwise would hit. 
 Otherwise you would have to buy or make a spacer for the dual circuit MC.  
The splash pan fits our 1960 panel camper conversion just fine with the dual 
circuit MC.
  Good idea if you use old fashioned brake fluid that attracts moisture like 
a magnet, to completely take apart all the brake cylinders every two years or 
30,000 miles, whichever comes first.  Clean out all surface rust in the 
cylinders and blow out the brake lines.  Then put it all back together with new 
brake fluid.
  We are changing our brake fluid in our buses over to silicon brake fluid 
that does not attract moisture so much less problems with rust in the cylinders 
or metal brake lines.  Will still take the cylinders apart as scheduled above 
to see how the cylinders are doing.
