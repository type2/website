&gt;Hi Glynn,
&gt;Well the fuel gauge came in 1962 and the fuel reserve was last seen in the
&gt;1961 buses if our memories serve us right.  You could have had a fuel gauge
&gt;installed at the dealership in buses from chassi # 20-117 902 on up to when
&gt;the fuel gauge became standard in the bus.  VW Techincal Bullitian K 6
shows
&gt;how to do this installation.

chassis number 639278 without going to check if memeory serves me right..

to be truthful, the gauge does look original, so does the hole the its
in...so i suppose it could be dealership fitted one.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt; but no go with the gauge...   so, i've looked at the top of the sender
and
&gt;theres only one wire -
&gt;            Yes, the Technical Bulletain shows the you have to have a
ground
&gt;wire connected to one of the senders mounting bolts and then the other end
&gt;screwed to the bus body firewall forward of the tank.  In the standard fule
&gt;senders of later buses this grond wire connected to the rear of the tank
&gt;instead.   Eric&amp;Barb

That is a great help to me - thank you!....

as soon as i've finished the brakes - thats the next job. cheers.
