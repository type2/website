&gt; John &quot;human calculator&quot; Flowers  said:
&gt; &gt;... should check out the UK based '51 Standard on Everett's site.
&gt; At today's exchange rate the price is $6,555.73 plus shipping to the US.
&gt; But, it's believed to be the oldest bus in the UK and certainly looks
worth
&gt; saving.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Ummm, http://finance.yahoo_dot_com/m5?a=3650&amp;s=GBP&amp;t=USD says that L3650 is
&gt; US $5332.28


&quot;The Human Calculator&quot; responds:

Sorry Everett, I mistakenly used L 4,495.00 as the starting price.
I was looking at their '51 split window beetle and confused the figures.
For the exchange rate, I used www.oanda_dot_com, I think they have the best
currency converter on the web, and yesterday they were quoting 0.684 USD to
1 GBP (British Pound). Their table comes back with  $5,326.26.
british pounds.
