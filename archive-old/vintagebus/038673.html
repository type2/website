&gt; sounds like a decent price for a  fair body w/no motor .    Seems reasonable
&gt; if the body isn't toast .  It it is a decent driver you got a deal.  DO look
&gt; at othe things than the camping kit when buying the box though.
&gt;C
actually, clara, it was just the camping kit. no bus involved. i guess i
should have made that more claer. i did buy it and it is in my dormobile
now. it works pretty good.  the synergy between the so42 and the dormobile
top are impeccable. the overhead rear cabinet/closet/sheft thing lines right
up with the edge of the dormobile top. the only thing is it was for a
non-walkthrough. which i kind of like. except it makes it harder to access
the back and still close the doors. seeing as i don't have an interior
handle for the dominant cargo door (the one that needs to be opened first).
if someone has the short bench for an so42, i might be willing to trade for
the perfect long one.

here is a list of the spare parts i have from it:
two side closets complete with hooks and mirrors and all. one is from a
baywindow. we figured that out after trying to cram it init's rightful place
and having it stick out the back. i suppose you could cut the back two
inches off if you didn't mind hacking baywindow westy parts. i thought about
using it just because it's in such great shape. unfortunately, i'm too
clumsy and lazy to attempt cutting cabinetry.

the other one is pretty ratty, but complete, albiet complete in a few
pieces.

there is also a set of 5 jalousie windows that i got. i don't think i'm
going to use them. they are fairly complete. the only things they are
missing are two of the overhanging aluminum pieces that bolt to the body
above thw windows.

i also have what appears to be a sundial table with a leaf that fits in the
middle. very cool, but didn't match my countertop for the icebox.

the only piece i'm missing is the little rear corner closet that goes on the
driver side. the bus that the campbox came from was hit in that corner. so i
imagine it was demolished.

of course, if any of you find a dormobile interior in any condition complete
with &quot;Dormatic&quot; seats and table, i would be more than willing to drive out
top you and do a swap for the so40. it's kind of my holy grail of bus parts.
probably more rare than that middle seat panel piece that Thom needs for his
RHD Barndoor Deluxe.

oh, yeah, i also have a six volt eberspacher gas heater FS if anybody is
interested. I found an identical 12v one that i'm going to use.

i will have pics of all soon.

sorry to repond so late. i have about 800 more emails to sort through from
this time-hungry list.

thanks y'all (southern lingo),
