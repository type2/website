I think its just the deluxe models 23/15 windows that received factory body 
trim/bumpers pre 53.
Trucks, panels, standards, kombis did not.

&lt;&lt;Body mounted rear corner bumpers is the way the factory did it till 53. Sun
visors were used in the standards and up versions (unless I'm mistaken). The
panel busses got pressboard visors.
