Hello all!

Thom hasn't announced it, so I will.  :)  Go to www.type2_dot_com and
click on &quot;Archive&quot; in the left navigation bar.  The archive is back!

Improvements to the interface and searching are forthcoming.  Also,
right now, it does not contain the very latest messages - I am
working on a mechanism to have the list messages added to the
archive as they come across.  In other words, the archive will be
at most one day behind the mailing list when I get this implemented.

All email addresses, and anything that even looked like it might
have been an email address, was munged (changed) before going in
the archives, to help prevent spam.  It should be fairly obvious
how to unmunge the addresses once you see them.

For the computer geeks, the archive is implemented entirely in
open source tools, including FreeBSD, Apache, ht://Dig, vi, awk,
and grep.  There are over 36,000 vintagebus messages archived,
66,000 old Vanagon list messages archived, and over 40,000 type2
messages archived.

Lots of folks helped out on this, including Ken Hooper, Saro 
Marcarian, Steven Dolan, and many more.

Enjoy!

Matt Roberds
