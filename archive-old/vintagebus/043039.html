I still can't quite believe that this has happened.  I &quot;talked&quot; to Josh
just a week or so ago.  We were kindred souls in our thoughts that a Bus
is worth saving just because it is a Bus and not that it might be
profitable to do so.  The side I saw of Josh was always upbeat -- he
wanted to help people and save Busses.  I wish I had got to know him
better.

I will miss him.

Any word on whether there will be a memorial fund or if Josh had a
favorite charity?

I'm going to go hug my sleeping children now ...
