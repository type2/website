I just finished doing mine last night.

If at all possible, I'd recommend doing it the old fashioned
way, meaning pulling the engine and taking the heads off.  
You need to get in tune touch with your inner engine every now
and then...

For kicks, I also put some aviation permatex on the pushrod tube
itself, under the seal, and around the seal itself, hoping for a 
more leak-free engine.  I also re-did the fuel pump gaskets and
generator stand gaskets.  I'm also thinking about doing the
rear main seal, cause I figure it will start to leak after I
put the engine back in, just out of spite...

Tonight I adjust the valves, put the engine back in, and start on the
reduction box bearings and wheel seals.

My incentive for doing all the work on the '56 all of a sudden?
I told myself I couldn't work on the '55 until I got the '56 fixed!
