&lt;&lt; thanks for the ideas..i should add that the engine turns over fine when
hot but sputters away alot before starting up..   then s-l-o-wl-y it catches
on and usually gives a nice puff of white smoke before it crawls to life..&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Well that does help to know.  That means it probably is not the starter,
solinoid, or ignition switch.  It is probably something in the carburator
delivering too much fuel (Is is smelling badly of fuel out of the muffler
when this happens?) or maybe a bad connection to the coil, or carburator shut
off solinoid.  Then when the engine is hot and has lots of compression the
starter takes a little more voltage to turn it over and these other
electrical devises do not get enough if there is a voltage drop some where to
them.

&lt;&lt; would a voltage regulator have anything to do with this?&gt;&gt;
Could be.  It would be a good idea to check EVERYTHING with a voltage gauge.
