&lt;&lt; Hey y'all
 got a good one.  Getting ready to do the brakes on the Dor and I was
 wondering what the best way to get all the black gunk outta the brake
 reservoir might be.  The openings are too small to stick my finger in.
 I tried swishing brake fluid around but didn't loosen much at all.  Any
 answers?
 Dave &gt;&gt;

use a turkey baster to suck all the old fluid out.

if it is single circuit I can reach with a rag and wipe the black gurk out,   
if it is dual it is more tricky.    a toothbrush with rag?
