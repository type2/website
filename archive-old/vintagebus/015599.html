I just got a quote of $196 for the westy and the panel.  Agreed values
of $18k and $9k respectively.

&gt; I was just quoted a declared value policy by Hagerty Insurance. The car in question is used primarily for shows,  occasional pleasure driving, and garaged. I was quoted $187.00 annually without a mileage restriction.
