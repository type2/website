Hi list

Anyone out there know how high I can go as far as headlamp bulb wattage
is concerned while keeping the stock headlamp circuit of my '60 bus. It
has the floor mounted dimmer switch if that makes any difference.

I realise that the bayonet type bulbs may not be available in very much
higher wattages than the miserable 35's that I was able to find so I
would be quite happy to rig the headlight buckets to take later prong
type fittings.

If I'm told that the dimmer/headlight switch/other components can't take
the wattage I will have to go the relay route. I seem to screw up just
about anything electrical that goes beyond the 'unplug old component and
plug in new component' level so I would be happy to settle for a
moderate increase in lighting power and thereby avoid rewiring anything.


Any advice appreciated.

Later   

Michael
