&gt; A *LOT* less... but then I bought mine from a true bus enthusiast that was
&gt; more interested in seeing the seat go to the correct bus than just lining
his
&gt; pockets like the clown speculators on ebay who don't even own a DD
&gt; passenger bus...
&gt;

    Do you know for sure where the seat is going ? Your friend
did a very admirable thing by selling the seat to you at a &quot;fair&quot; price.
But does that mean that Isaiah should do the same with somebody ?
Why should it not sell for big bucks? Obviously this person wanted that seat
BAD !
It's the rarest of middle seats(though 3g's is f ' nuts ).But, more power to
Isaiah !!
    I have become friends with Isaiah, and I feel he is  a &quot;TRUE&quot; bus
enthusiast.
Way To Go Isaiah !!!

                        &quot;keep on pushin'&quot;

ps. Think school Isaiah !!
