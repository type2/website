Subject: Re: [VB] BRake spring help still needed

Hi Eric &amp; Barb,
Thanks for the info. That's how mine is positioned, but I still don't 
seem to have enough tension to force the pedal up all the way. I greased 
everything, so I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. The only other 
varible is that there is a metal donut next to the spring and I am not sure 
if the open end of the donut faces in toward the spring or out toward 
the hole in which the odd bolt goes through. And it all looked so 
simple....
