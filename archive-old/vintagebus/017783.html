Subject: engine lid seal..

Additional problem since our buses came off the assembly line is the lack of
good engine lid to body seal today! What is most often offered by seal 
suppliers is slightly better than installing pieces of garden hose. Eric&amp;Barb


regarding the poor quality of engine lid to body seals...I ordered one last
year, but the quality seemed so bad, i never installed it.
Any one know where to get a really good seal? Or is this something that needs
to be salvaged from a junkyard. currently i have 3/4 of my original in pretty
good shape, the last 1/4 is missing.
