Subject: Re: [VB] What exaust should I use? /exhaust theory

Hey jason
I took a stock 36hp muffler for 1192cc and made it fit on my 1600cc single
port, cause I wanted the stock apron and exhaust tip (I have a 57). Some
people said too much back pressure blah blah blah. Been drivin it like that
for 3 years now, engine runs great, lots of torque. Seems even better then
a stock 1600cc exhaust, sure does look better =)
Your only stepping up 41cc from what your muffler is designed for. I
stepped up 400cc.
    A 36hp tip can be finagled onto a 1600cc exhaust as well, which shows
they never really tried to eliminate any bottlenecks in exhaust flow,
although the port is aiming a bit too high causing the tip to interfere
with the bumper.You can also add the fact that they actually *increased*
the tailpipe length times 4 with 2 more bends! which sounds like they would
be reducing flow even more... My point is, It doesnt seem like the exhaust
really changed that much over the years anyway, besides where they wanted
the exhaust gases pointing. Wouldn't you think VW would've went to a dual
tip or a big fat tip after going up 400cc if it made that much difference?
IMHO

 I think that a stock

(1)
&gt;only one tailpipe as opposed to two, increasing back pressure (2) the
stock
&gt;bus tip narrows at the end, causing even more back pressure. Anyone have
any
&gt;thoughts on this idea?
