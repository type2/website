Subject: first trip report in 61, and the ride of shame
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10005021105480.28555-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have gone to my first campout in my 61 van.. it was great!

We drove down to the &quot;dam campout&quot; at the lake of the ozarks... All of the
most active missouri micros were there... as well as the diehard kansas
city crowd (though a few were notably absent...) and, of course many from
the lake of the ozarks area in general... 

It was really a nice mellow campout.  Much fun was had by all... the 61
performed flawlessly, never missed a beat, though it was a bit hard to
start at times, once warmed up it passed the test with der flying colors.

The full width camper bed i had purchased and installed was CUSH!  Its the
thick mustard padding kind, and about a queen sized bed... there was room
for myself, corie and the dog all up there with room to spare. Not like my
71 where we have to plan out carefully who sleeps where so as not to fall
off or get shoved into a cabinet/elbows in the side etc.  the only
drawback was i had to drill 4 holes in the rear wheelwells for the bed
brakets, it was just too unsteady without these... I dont feel so bad as
this bus had been camperized once before and there were already 8-10 holes
that would need filling someday, now there are just a few more...

We went shopping in the local town and i found a key making machine like
locksmiths use for $40 at a curio shop... SCORE! and then one of the other 
people there (thanks rick) had a pile of VW key blanks to donate to the
cause.  there were several people that needed keys made, but the blanks we
had didnt fit their busses... oh well, i have a line on where to get
blanks, so i will be all set by the next campout :)

The ride home was uneventful as well, but now for the shame part...

I knew i needed to look at my fuel pump, and buy a new carb (mine has been
rebuilt several times, but it just wont work right no matter what i do..)

So anyway im leaving work monday for a Dr. appt.  and all of a sudden the
bus just dies in traffic, and i cant get it started again...  finally i
get it going, but just enough to get into a parking lot.

I ckeck the coil/wires/spark etc. thats all good, the points look good,
but it just wont run right.

Finally i see raw gas leaking out of the intake manifold where those
donuts are on a dual port (have to tighten that up) and decide either the
carb or fuel pump has breathed its last breath.  I'm sure i could have
torn into it and figured something out, but since i have towing coverage
in my insurance i give up and decide to have it towed to my garage.

I had to explain to the towing guy how to hook it up on the flatbed as
he's used to the kind with slots.  Put the big hooks fver the front
beam and the rear torsion housing and cranked it down tight.

Going through my neighborhood with my bus up on a towtruck was so
embarassing.  Its one thing to have a car towed, but another entirely i
think when you do all the maintenace yourself... a matter of pride i'd
say.  I know driving 30+ year old cars, its bound to happen someday, but
it was still embarassing... especailly since i knew my carb was
questionable i just have been too broke to buy a new one (i dont want to
fiddle with used anymore.)

So, the 61 will sit until i get back from Costa Rica (i'm leaving monday,
and will be back 2 weeks after that)  We have a lot of preparing to do for
that trip... and there is no time or money right now to fix this.

Maybe carbs will be cheaper there and i can bring back a gift for my bus
:)

take care,

Steve
