&gt;do it!!!     lets form a friggin club.
&gt;
I'm there...

&gt;(but think about an extra spring back there so the throttle doesn't always
&gt;stay a tad on)


Yup, both of mine have the big footy. They can be frightening if not done up
right. Don't even think about mounting it with the el cheapo strap they come
with unless you've always wanted an unreleaseable cruise control on
occasion. You'll be cruising along, having kicked off your Birkenstocks,
playing toesies with the pedal and grooving to something in a nice 8-track,
maybe Joe Cocker sings Abba's greatest hits, and the little chromium plated
genuine accessory footy will slide down on the accelerator pedal. Next thing
you know, the little old blue-haired lady in the mammoth Chrysler product in
front of you looks up from her newspaper realizes she's bearing down on a
line of cute little duckies or some such, and slams on the brakes. =8^O So,
you push in the clutch, pound on the brakes, nearly rip a toe off trying to
disengage from your intimate grip on the gas pedal, and fill your skivvies
right up. Meanwhile, the footy which you treasure has preventing the gas
pedal from returning to the upright and locked position. Motor is still
tooling along at Mach 3, and it's not happy. In spite of your
hyperventilating, drooling, pounding heart, and the indelicate condition of
your undergarments, you have to regain enough composure to reach down, grab
the toe jam encrusted pedal and slide it back up so the pedal will come off
the floor before you throw a rod. All this while the hairy-backed truck
driver that almost rear-ended you is making all manner of derogatory
comments about your ancestry. I ask you, do any of us really need that? No.
So after you bandage your toe, do any pressing personal hygeine, and clean
the 64 oz. sody-pop out of your 8-track player, drill two holes through the
footy and your gas pedal and throughbolt it. Also, rather than
double-springing the carb, I put a throttle return spring from the FLAPS
under the floorboard right on the linkage, so it wouldn't add additional
load on the throttle butterfly or cable.
