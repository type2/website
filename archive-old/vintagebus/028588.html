Thom, they built 356's till 1965, but also started Porsche 911 production in
1964. The 3 piece case should have given it away to you. Did anybody ever
see the extended roof BD (I guess this bus is a custom, but because it's a
BD it must be cool, or just another hack), it has an early 356 A Porsche
engine in it.

Wouldn't a &quot;late 60's&quot; Porsche engine be a 2.xL 911 engine?  Oh wait, it
could be a 912 - forgot about that.

&gt; I have a 64 bus but I have no good engine (rod through the case). Buying
the bus
&gt; cleaned me out so it's on blocks until I save the funds to build myself a
top
&gt; quality 1600dp. In the meantime, I would love to drive this bus. I've had
no
&gt; luck in scrounging up a VW engine for free, but... yes, an offer of a
genuine
&gt; Porsche engine. Who would have guessed? Too bad I don't have a Porsche. Do
you
&gt; think I use it until I build an engine that doesn't require $900 parts?

Beware of free gifts.  If someone is *giving* you a 356/912 engine, you may
be in for more expense than if you just bucked up and spent the cash on a
good
VW engine.   The 356 engines are MUCH more expensive to fix than the VW
ones,
simply because of that magical &quot;P&quot; word.   I know people have run these
engines in buses, but I'm not intimate with the conversion.
