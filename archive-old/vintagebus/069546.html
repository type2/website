Subject: RE: [VB] restore or not to

Very top probably needs to be resheeted or it'll
leak - could do this simple repair, prime it (the top), paint it 
and then rub the paint back for a 'show-thru' look.

Rivet patches (aircraft style?) over the other
couple of holes to seal it up?

Go through it mechanically, new seals, perhaps
a set of period wheels and USE that thing.

When it has served you well and you have the time,
repay with a rest and a resto?
