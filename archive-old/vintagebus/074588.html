Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

&gt; Just wondering if anybody has got one of EMPI's new aluminum cases yet?

Funny, with all the threads on the alum. cases, the other day my  engine
builder ordered a new case for me, &amp; was furious when the case arrived &amp; it
was alum. instead of a regular vw case.  I asked him about the alum cases, &amp;
he said they are &quot;a mess&quot;.  He also said they run about 15 degrees hotter &amp;
weigh about 15 lbs. more. (is there a 15/15 rule? grin)

Anyone know anything about the hotter/weight scenario?

Tom Buese-not hearing any benefits to alum cases to make trying one worth it
