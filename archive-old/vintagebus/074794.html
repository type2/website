&gt; I have been getting good reviews from everyone who has seen them.  Sorry,
&gt; still haven't had the time to put up any pictures, I'm not sure I want to
&gt; advertise too much since I really don't want to make too many of these, they
&gt; do take a lot of machining and welding time.  I may make 1 or 2 per month if
&gt; time permits. 

Ooops! I did post a pic of one on the Samba under Shows-RMMW

Tom Buese-still don't know how to post links to pics on a website-help?
