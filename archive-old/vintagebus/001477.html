Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Sending Unit


&gt; I've been getting way too much experience with these
&gt; things lately.  I've had 4 different senders in my '67
&gt; Deluxe.  &gt;
&gt; This motor is the original block with 1600, DP heads,
&gt; CW crank, 009, 34 PICT-3, and extractor, all done by
&gt; the PO.  I can't see any modifications to the oil
&gt; system.  Could there be some kind of one-way
&gt; (anti-drainback?) valve or something keeping pressure
&gt; in my system after the engine is stopped?  Could I
&gt; have some excessive oil pressure that consistently
&gt; blows each oil sender on one start?  I have almost no
&gt; leakage or dripping from this hard-working motor.

I would buy or borrow a mechanical oil pressure gauge and screw it into the
block in place of the sender and see what you have. Measure starting
pressure, warm running pressure and pressure after shutdown. This will give
you a starting point for further steps.

Let me know what happens
