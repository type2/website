&gt; Anyone ever tried the V-Twin 20W-50 Mobil1 in their air-cooler?

I don't think I want my VW to be as reliable as a Harley!

I note that BMW still recommends ordinary motor oil for their air cooled
opposed twins.  Apparently there is no significant difference in the needs
of air and watercooled engines.

I note that my latest case of oil is now marked &quot;SL&quot; while the last case
was &quot;SJ&quot;.  I guess they skipped K or it was around for a short time.
