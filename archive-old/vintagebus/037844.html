&gt; what is a good price to pay for a set good ribbed bumpers--- Im thinking about getting a set I found , but want tomake sure the price is  right--
&gt; -they have no rust and are straight.
&gt;
I usually think ~$500, without brackets/splash pans.

If remember correctly, there were 2 sets of truck ribbed bumpers for $700/set at the last Pomona.  I believe they were still there when I left.  Front bumper is the same, of course.  Both were decent but not &quot;paint and bolt up to your show truck&quot; quality.
