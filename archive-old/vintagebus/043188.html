&gt; &quot;Extend&quot; is also a great product. Get it at your local FLAPS. Try working it

I have to disagree here... I tried Extend back in the mid 80's, using it
as directed, for the intended purpose, and it always failed to stop rust
&gt;from continuing to generate. It was uncanny.

The spray on hi-zinc is suspect as well. It didnt seem to do much back in
the late 70's for me.
