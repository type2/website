 I was told it was a late 53 when I bought it, which would have been
&gt; a dream being todays my birthday and I've always wanted a year of birth
bus,

Hey Ronnie,
Happy birthday young man, and thank you for your help throughout the year.
I was born in November 1950; I'd like to have a year of birth bus too!!!!
John Flowers
