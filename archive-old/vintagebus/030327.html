Subject: Mirror of NQ's BBB V Adventure Page

Hi all,
As you may have heard 2 members of the Buskatiers from Nebraska, Erin
&quot;NQ&quot; Lassley and Robert Laffoon left for BBB V on Thursday night. He has
started posting pictures of thier Adventure. You can see the original
posts _at_ http://www.oldvolks_dot_com/events/bbb/2001Photo/Friday/
For those of you with slower connections or would like to see the
pictures in thumbnails before downloading the entire pages you can see
them _at_
http://204.26.80.78:8084/bbbv/bridge.html
I regret not being able to be with them but they know that I am with
them in spirit.
