Alrightey Volks,

Full Moon Bus Club is hosting Indigibus for all bus Owners on ColumBus Day
Weekend but we need your help.... Family Feud questions are in, and we need
your answers......please take a few moments of your time to answer the
following questions.  I know that many of you may not be planning on
attending this event, but that doesn't mean that you cant help your fellow
busmates out, right?  I would like to thank those of you who did send
questions in.  I would like to thank Buddah for letting us use this event at
the East Meets West Indigibus.  Please only give one answer for each
question.  I really do appreciate your help.  Shawn
for the questions....

You may as well dance.
