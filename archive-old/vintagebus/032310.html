Yeah...it's sad, BUT that bus was BEAT! And that's coming from someone who
is tackling the Lunchwagen. Plus...it wasn't a factory high roof, it was
some off brand add-on. Not that that made it worse, just even tougher to
fix right. Plus...it would have cost a couple thousand to get it here.
So...keep all of that in mind. Trust me, if it could have been done, it
would have a SV2s logo on it by now!
