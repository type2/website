&gt; Sounds like you did not install a fuel filter sock (111 209 147 A) in there.  

Actually it is in there, the old one disintegrated when I took it out (and it
looked yummy!) so it's brand new.  I didn't know it served as a gasket though!

&gt; filter sock with it's aluminum rim to seal there.  We prefer to install a 
&gt; fuel proof gasket on top of the fuel filter sock as was done at the factory.  

I put my gasket beneath the disc-shaped part so it blocked fuel seeping around
the tube and out the bottom.  I didn't even think of fuel creeping out the top
past the threads.  Have you had trouble with this before?  There didn't seem
to be any gasket stuff on the filter I pulled from the tank.

FYI it's a '67 tank.
