Subject: Re: [VB] Bouncy Bus -- Shock Absorber Recs

I've talked to a lot of bus folk that prefer gas shocks over regular oil,
but I personally swear on running oil shocks if you want a nice comfortable
ride. I've run both on my buses, and i've found less back pain after a 400
mile drive with oil shocks compared to gas.
