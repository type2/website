Subject: re gas guage installation

Personally I wouldn't cut a hole in the dash for guages.   I'd get a guage 
holder and put the gas gauge in that in or under the dash tray to the right of 
the steering wheel.   

I've seen guages in the vent cover, and I am not sure how that affects the 
function of it, but I'd suspect the guages would get soggy when driving in the 
rain.  

I recommend getting a 14 4 wire cable.  it's a bunch of 4 14 guage wires in a 
thick rubberised sheath.  I got about 20 feet of this and put it in my 61 
from by the fuse box back into the engine compartment by the coil.   The wires go 
for 
1 oil temp
2 was oil pressure until I pulled the sender to put in green bus, now is 
nothing
3 euro taillight brake lights, 
4 tach, 

you could use this for the gas guage sender wire and any other guages you may 
eventually feel like putting in the bus

The guage pod on the roof panel sounds interesting.  just might be annoying 
running the wires to/from the guages

&gt; Can you still use the air vent if you've got the
&gt; guages there?  If not, how
&gt; do you block it off?  I'm thinking of maybe doing
&gt; this with my bus.  Thanks.
