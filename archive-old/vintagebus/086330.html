Subject: getting rid of cut-up VW in California ?

 I found a squareback for $150 that I was thinking of taking the motor + trans from, 
 
plus a few other parts, 
 
But being in the Peoples Republic I was wondering if there were some weird rules that I do not know of concerning scraping a car, 
 
I have the title so that not the problem...
 
Thanks for your ideas
 
DAVE
