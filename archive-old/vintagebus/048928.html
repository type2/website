I guess I should have provided a little more info on my first post.  Here's the dope:

The cup holders are made out of 18 guage sheet metal covered with a thick rubber coating.  They mount to the bottom lip of the dash from underneath via 2 screws.  Mounting is basically the same as the light switch and windshield wiper switch.  Thus, no holes can be seen unless your lying on the front floor.

They'll come in two sizes, regular which accomodates most ordinary cans, bottles, styrofoam cups, insulated coffee cups, etc.  The large version is more for the moster size big gulp cups or large water bottles, basically any cup or bottle with a bottom diameter of 3 1/4&quot; or smaller.  Anything bigger than that you're on your own.  I would think most people would just want a regular size, but there is a choice.  Price is the same regardless of size.

Any other q's please pmail me.

Robert
