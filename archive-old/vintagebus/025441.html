&gt; Ok, what is the scoop with regards to the full flow pumps/filter adapter.   Is a
&gt; replacement oil pump cover tapped for lines to a filter sufficient?  Or should I
&gt; get the adapter that has the pump built into it.  Seems that with just the
&gt; replacement cover, only a small amount of oil will actually go through the filter
&gt; by luck.

Steve,

When you install one of the covers with the tapped hole for running a
filter you also have to plug the outlet of the pump. This forces all of
the oil to flow through your filter and then back into the case through
another hole you tap in the end of one of the oil passages.

I prefer the outlet cover method, but I had one of those filter/pump
deals years ago. When the engine it was in died from causes not related
to oil at 50K miles, the crankshaft still looked like new and it checked
&quot;to spec&quot;.
