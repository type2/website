Subject: RE: [VB] Moab, Utah, BUS HELP/update

He should be fine if the rest of his engine is solid. I made
it back to Norman, OK from just south of St. Louis on 3 cylinders back in
the 80s. I had disabled #3 thinking that it was going on me (pull plug and
pushrods), and discovered on arrival that the missing-at-speed was caused
by a defective connection at the coil!

So, he should make it there just fine.
