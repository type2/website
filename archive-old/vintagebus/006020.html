&gt;I found a 3-ft high pile of rust w/ a VW logo on it... anyone know where I
can get some ore to smelt, some machines to stamp metal and a used VW plant
to repair it?
&gt;
My neighbor in my first apartment said he had a foundry in his basement.

Of course, he also came banging on our door at 6 am on a Sunday screaming he
needed firewood so maybe that wasn't true.  When I answered the door, his
pupils were so wide, I understood what it was like to stare into a black
hole.

He also told me he used to live on the street and kids would kick him on
their way to school but that's another story...
