Uhaul, Ryder and most of your other moving van co. will not let you put a
vehicle in a rental van.  But who says you have to play by the rules?  This
was what I was thinking last summer when I made my move with my plethera of
busses.  But the probem was getting it into the van.  I called  one of those
flatbed carrier type tow trucks thinking they could lift and put it in.
Unfortunately, they knew the rules and would not put it in the van for me.
You would have to have a ramp or something to get her in there
