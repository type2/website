&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;  As promised we found the spare accelerator cable sheeth we recently bought 
&gt;  from Bow Wow up here and installed in our 1960 panel camper conversion.  
&gt; Part 
&gt;  number is 131 721 551.  It is interesting that we had to shorten this 
about 
&gt;  7mm from it's 603mm length to fit properly in our 60 panel and the 
original 
&gt;  part 111 721 551 is listed as &quot;Protective tube - Accelerator cable 
(shorten 
&gt;  to 670 mm)&quot;.
&gt;  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;  
hm, you shortened it from 603 mm to 670mm by cutting off 7mm?   I don't 
understand.    I have one I pulled out of a bug (didn't measure) in my 65, 
but it does seem a tad long and I didn't install one in my 61, which would be 
nice to do.
