Hi Skid,
Probably best to just buy a new crank then.  With the high fire temp the 
crank probably softened.  Then again if the firemen sprayed it with water 
when it was still hot enough it would have hardened and will be more likely 
to crack!  VW forged thier cranks and on the 25-36 HP and possibly on the 
later cranks induction (Electrically.) hardened a thin layer of the bearing 
journals.     Eric&amp;Barb
