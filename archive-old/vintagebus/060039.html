Subject: Tight valve update


Thanks to all who lent advice. Turns out the valves were ok after my
second check, just double checked a few to be certain. But they were
tight eariler, and I know why the sound of valves (well sortof)
remained. It's my generator. I have the 905mm belt on, just put a new
one to double check, and with one shim (the rest outside, of course,
still loose) the belt vibrates around and sounds bad. Pulled the belt on
cold engine, fired it up, and she sounded ok. I can be fairly certain it
will be time to put a new generator and pulley in the bearings are
sounding bad. I figure, since I have been unhappy with these heads from
day one, I will do both new heads and a generator as a project, which
will probably save me a world of trouble later.
Thanks again,
AL
