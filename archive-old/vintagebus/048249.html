&lt;&lt; Definitely sounds good to us, but if so why was it not used later than 
 1958ish and especially when the standard bus after 1963 production went from 
 3/4 ton to one ton payload capacity.  Also has anyone found any of the 
smooth 
 lug area rims being dated before 1958? &gt;&gt;

The other item is that the wheel are (as I remeber) two different 
manufacturers - One was Lemmerz (manufacturer of the Empi Sprint Stars as 
well) and I can't remember the other.  I'll check and get back with the list.
