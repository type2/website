&gt; &gt; Quick Question:  On my 58, the front doors open really far.  Like about
&gt; &gt; 110 degrees which puts them further around than sticking straight out
&gt; &gt; from the bus.  Is this the way they're supposed to be?  Or is there some
&gt; &gt; kind of stop or strap that keeps them from going to far?

Yes I think there is. You may see loops for attaching the thing on
your bus. 

&gt; '54, '55, '56 sounds like a johnny cash song or something...
&gt; 
&gt; I need a '53 and a '57 now...

Yeah, but then you'd have to get a '52, and a '58, and then a '51 and
a '59. I think that's about as far as you could go, though.

Bob
a '59 and a '69. Guess I need a '79, an '89 and a '99.
