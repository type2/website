It's interesting to compare the VW cooling concept (and listen to the relative
arguments) and then compare them to the equivalent Porsche ideas.  The major
break in the two was at the 911, of course.  For instance, VW people argue 
incessantly about cooling flaps, and how you doom your engine to a certain 
death without them.  The 911 engine doesn't use them, and people get upwards
of 300k on those engines.  Or the talk about cylinder fin attributes - the 
larger 911 engines don't have fins on top of the cylinders - they're smooth.
The cylinders on my 2.7 have merely a token of finnage

BTW, I got the correct owner's manual for my 911 at the 'rama for the princely
sum of $1
