Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums...

I've had the same problem with my '62 :

The arm puller I hired at that time didn't help at all.

I ended up heating the sucker until it got bright red and it finally came
out, but the whole braking system inside had suffered.

I would recommend this solution as the very last to be tried out, or in the
case of a complete restauration (ie : brakes cylinders, shoes and Rboxes)

Bertrand
