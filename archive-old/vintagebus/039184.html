I don't do collective, but here's my take . .
uh . . or rather give.

I have a couple of each variety of 'wrenches',
both regular socket and the dog bone shaped ones,
of various sizes to fit a bus, sqbk, whatever.

Both the dogbone ones have a 12 inch square hole
in the sledge end for use with a 1/2 inch drive.
Coupled with an extension arm, I have rarely
had to rely on a sledge, oh all right a big hammer.

The advantage of the dogbone is that once you get
to the right torque, it ALWAYS puts the tower of
the castle over the hole!  The open nature of the
dogbone makes getting the hole and slot to line
up a much easier task due the better visibility.

Due to the cheap nature of these tools, just
accept that you will have to do a little filing
to get the internal hex to fit cleanly, as there
are burrs, rolled edges, etc. generated as a result
of the stamping die fabricating technique.  Since
these are made of relatively soft steel, one can
tap it onto the nut to get a tighter fit too.

The regular socket puts the lever arm out so far
&gt;from the rotation point that it tends to twist the
socket on the nut a bit, and being a harder material
it can bung the nut's edges, so try to avoid any
adapters or extensions, but that's tough since
the socket is usually a bigger drive than what
you've got.

Time to stop yapping.

What is the collective wisdom on the knock-off wrenches for the rear
axle nut? You know, the ones that you hit with a small sledge to turn? I
carry one in my road kit, since I don't carry an impact gun. But given
the choice I use a socket and impact.

Do the knock-off wrenches cause problems if used exclusively?
(I've never had any problems with them, but again, use them only when
absolutely necessary)
