Subject: Where all nice busses go.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone, I just found a site from Japan called Old Car's Market.  I 
recognized quite a few busses for sale on there site and thought people might 
like to see where and how much their busses are going for when they sell to 
Japan.  Prices are as expected.  Completely outrageous!!!  Check it out for 
yourself. http://www.oldcars.co.jp/vw/vw.html  (make sure to do a currency 
conversion of course)

Later,

speedo)
