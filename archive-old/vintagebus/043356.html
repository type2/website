&gt;Or easier to measure the resistance of the bulb and calculate

It's not quite that easy.  Tungsten's resistance increases
with its temperature, so measuring a cold bulb with an
ohmmeter will give you a wildly different answer than
measuring it in circuit with an ammeter.

As an example, I have here an 1157 tail-light bulb.
The &quot;book&quot; specs are:

bright filament:  12.8V, 26.9W, 2.10A  (R=V/I=12.8/2.1=6.1 ohms)
dim filament:     14.0V,  8.3W, 0.59A  (R=24 ohms)

Actually measuring the bulb with my DMM gives 0.5 ohms for the
bright filament and 2.1 ohms for the dim filament.  By Ohm's
Law, this means the bright filament is 328W and the dim
filament is 93W.  If this were true, the tail light lenses on
a new car would melt the first time the driver stepped on the
brake.

When I connect the bulb to a 12V power supply I have, I get

bright filament  13.3V, 2.19A  (29.1W, 6.07 ohms)
dim filament     13.5V, 0.57A  (7.70W, 23.7 ohms)

These numbers are much closer to the published spec.
This is why I suggested to Thom that he measure his
unknown bulbs in-circuit.
