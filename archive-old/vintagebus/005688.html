hmmm well this has basically been done already, or it looked like it
anyways. Is the man from Jerome that had the green and white camper with the
complete shower hookup on the back, on this list anywhere? he had a roof
rack with half circle cutouts of wood to hold a (50 gal?) water container
and then some sort of  metal tubes that attached to the side of the rack and
went straight out and down into the free standing shower. inside of those
tubes, ran the water line and a shower chain to turn it on and off. the
shower itself consisted of a PVC frame I think, on top of some boards and a
green and white wrap around curtain to match. all this was done up very
nicely and all color matched to the bus. Sounds like you and him would be
good buddies :)
