Subject: re: [VB] Kumho 185sr15 

Ellis installed Kuhmo 205/75/15's on the 63 EZ camper.
Coupled with the 3.88 tranny it was great! Bad A**ed
tires/tyres. Initial concerns with being &quot;too big&quot; or
reducing the fan speed and thereby running the engine
hot were quickly put aside.

I'd highly recommend that brand and size. Pmail for
current owners impressions for a comparison.
regards,
Ellis\
