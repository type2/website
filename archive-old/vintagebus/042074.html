&gt; Hey list,
&gt; 
&gt; The tires I was talking about have 2 ply sidewalls, and 1400 pound rating.  
&gt; He has 2 sizes, 205 75 14, 225 70 14,  The 205's are $140 for 4, the 225's 
&gt; are 160 for 4.  Which should I get?  I have a 4.12 rancho and soon will have 
&gt; a new 1600 dual port.( I do not know if that matters or not?)

The answer is NONE!  The minimum rating for a bus is 1540 pounds.  This is
load range C in 185R14 and load range _D_ in the 195/75R14 and similar
sizes.  1400 is _way_ too low.

Search a bit longer and get the proper 185R14 (no aspect ration) size.
You will be much happier in the end.  The Bridgestone RD-603 works well
and is available at any Firestone dealer, which are probably happy to sell
_any_ tires lately!
