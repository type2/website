A Propex heater installation
Michele's famous Splittie Cookies
Somebody elses famous Beetle cookies, I can't remember who
Steve Dolan's famous chili!
Numerous vendors (attending as friends - this is not a commercial event),
professed experts and assorted list personalities, who you've always wanted
to meet face to face
And most important, a great group of bus people, family and friends 

You don't need to RSVP to show up. Just bring your smiling face and
something to share- food or drink.
