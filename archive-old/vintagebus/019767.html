I noticed that as well, but I think it's just an effect of the digital camera.
No buses were harmed in the recording of that picture.

&gt; hey thom,
&gt; re http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2476.JPG
&gt; 
&gt; i notice those trails under the hailstones... they look like the hail is on
&gt; its way back up again.
&gt; did that big bugger on the left of picture - above the rear of the bus hit
&gt; or what?
&gt; it looks like it did and looks to be boucing away in the other direction
&gt; with some force .. if my bus got damage in a storm like that - it'd keep the
&gt; scars.
