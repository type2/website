Clara..(and list!)

If you missed it, the guy who posted that (gabe) only posted a small
portion of Steves original message.

Gabe has, over the past few months, made a few similar posts using
distorted content from messages that Steve has posted to the Type2 list.
Gabe posted to the vintagebus list, not to the type2 list.

as far as i can tell, Gabe is pissed off at Steve because he (gabe) was
removed from the type2 list after posting a test message to the list
(which is strictly forbidden in the list charter, which is sent to each
subscriber when they subscribe..)

He was first simply moderated, to prevent any further such posts in the
immediate future.  He was, of course, told this.  After that he attempted
to post a few beligerent messages that could easily classify as hatemail
against steve, and the list in general.  He posted some also to the
vintagebus list.


Attempts at private communication with Gabe over this matter have failed.

Below are both Gabe Mar's post to VintageBus as well as Steve's orignal
post to the Type2 list.

 &gt; Volks,

 don't know why :-( &gt; &gt;

Volks, 

I am at my wits end.  The '80 won't start and I don't know why :-( This is
part of the continuing series of problems that I believe the FI has been
giving me since I got the van.  All summer long, it ran lean and hot (Oil
= 250 at 60mph).  As the weather cooled down, the oil temps cooled right
along with them (210 _at_ 65mpg; air temp &lt;50), the engine felt like it was
getting more gas and the O2 meter on the dash said it was running richer.  
Thes past two weeks, the temps here have dropped below freezing and the
van will not start at all.  The engine is the MSHP Stage II in an '80
V'gon but the FI (AFM and Computer) is from an '81 federal bus.

What I have checked: (note all checks were static or while cranking)
Dwell = 50 
Timing ~8 BTDC
spark visually verified
Gas pressure = 30+psi at the tap between 3&amp;4

A couple weeks ago, the van would kick at the start of cranking, but not
start.  If I then depressed the gas half way and cranked it would start
after 10-20 seconds.  Now it does not kick, and if I crank for 30+
seconds, with the gas pedal fully depressed, it will buck a bit but not
start.  After this cranking, the rear of the bus smells heavily of
gasoline.

I *think* it is flooding almost instantly.  I further think that if I
could get a 40 degree day it would start, but I would *like* to cure this
problem, whaterver it is.  Any ideas???

I, for one, am tired of Gabe and his antics.  They have no place on this
list, or that.
