Ya, whenever I have taken a long trip in someones non vw it always seems to 
break down and cause hassles.    Look, you towed the barndoor, and the tow 
vehicles did that- more than once!!!!   That bus kicks booty, and I think it 
likes you.  Better keep it.

&lt;&lt; Great weekend as expected!
 I chose the trailer the '54 Barncamper over to the
 shows as previously discussed. Friend's Jeep Cherokee
 with tow pkg had problems all weekend long so I ended
 up driving the '54 from 20 miles East of Banning to
 the Coast. The Jeep got it's radiator sys fixed at
 PepBoys all day Sat and enjoyed a &quot;redo&quot; at PepBoys on
 Sunday. Friends missed most of both shows. 

...........Return trip was great until AZ border and friend's
 Jeep tranny started spewing ATF. Off loaded the barney
 one more time and drove home with the Jeep and trailer
 in tow. The bus performed like a champ with no
 problems. Apparently I could have done without the
 trailer rental as the barn seems to be capable of
 driving anywhere.
