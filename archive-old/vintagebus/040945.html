&gt; Has anybody replaced their canvas? My'67 is in dire need!
&gt; Looking for any opinions on quality, etc of the ones that are out there.


Almost all of the vendors get their canvas from the same manufacturer, an
California outfit that has been making Westy canvas for well over a decade.
This means that whether you get your replacement canvas from West Coast
Metric, Rocky Mountain Motorworks, myself, or almost anyone else you'll
probably get the same canvas.  (Only I sell it cheaper.)

It's not a bad product, good quality although not restoration-quality in
terms of looking 100% stock.  The material is 100% cotton, and while it
looks more porous than the original it is actually quite weatherproof.  As
opposed to Sunbrella, which has very little give, the cotton gives a bit
more, making for an easier, cleaner installation.  The canvas is tan, and
the zipper and screening are black.  Given the low price ($129 from me,
minus 5% listmember discount), I feel that the quality is very good for the
price (if not worthy of a no-holds-barred restoration).
