Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] cleaning hardware

I figure I could chime in here and give my 2 cents...

When ever I buy a bucket of fasteners from someone, I do the following
tasks:

- sort into like piles, bolts, screws, washers, nuts, etc, and remove all
garbage.  I separate screws into like piles also, sheet metal, flat head,
and cheese head.
- soak individual piles in carb cleaner for a few days and rinse off.
- wire wheel any pieces that need a bit more cleaning.
- sort into progressively similar piles.  I find that I separate 7mm and
smaller items in one bin and larger items in another so I end up with about
10-15 small piles.  My family eats a lot of fresh mozzarella cheese (the
wife is Italian) which comes in containers similar to a 16oz sour cream
container... these are what washers, nuts, screws, smaller bolts, etc. go
into.  Larger bolts get dumped into a large open tray for easy sifting.
- I would suggest that if your place of storage is damp, I'd spray
everything with a light mist of wd40 or some other similar product.
- before use, I chase all threads.... which I CANNOT stress enough as to how
important this is to NOT break fasteners off!!!!!!!


... - oh yea, if the piece of hardware is going on the double cab, I chase
the threads, and then send to the chrome shop.  When it returns, I chase the
threads again.

... and still always open to buy MORE old fasteners!
