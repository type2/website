&gt;Between too tight or too loose, I'll take loose any day of the week.
&gt;
&gt;(VALVES that is...)
&gt;

I set the valves in the singlecab at a 'loose' zero. Chromoly push rods, you
can do that. Of course you have to be on them like ugly on an ape. None of
this two to three thousand mile crap. Couple of hundred, maybe. It's nice
though, crawl under there with a 13mm and the Allen wrench for the swivel
feets. Tighten them up so the push rod won't spin with your finger then back
it off a touch and lock it down. No feeler guages. I use that hand to hold
my beer. YMMV
