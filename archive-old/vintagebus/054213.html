Subject: Re: [VB] Pop-out screws


Ed,

Carefully drill out the screws with an appropriate sized drill. If you do
it nicely, you won't bung up the threads, and have to retap for a larger
size and then have to look for matching screws. I went thru this with my
restoration. They drill out easy. Use a bit of cutting oil as well, to
save wear on the bit. Go easy and lightly, and you'll be done in no
time. WW sells the screws, and I believe so did Vintage Parts, Burbank.

If you use a small bit, the vibration usually loosens the screw up anyway,
and some Liquid Wrench will allow it to be removed by turning and or
prying, without ruining the threads.

As others have mentioned, if you ruin the threads, have someone weld it
up, sand it smooth, punch it, drill, thread it. 

When you reassemble, coat the threads with anti-sieze (Loctite/Permatex
133K).

&gt; I'm REALLY frustrated.  I've spent most of the day trying to remove the
&gt; small screws that hold the pop-out frames together.  Although my frames
&gt; are in ok shape, the screws all seem to be rusted into their holes.
&gt; I've tried 6,473 different screwdrivers, and I seem to just break the
&gt; heads of the screws.  I went to one tool store, and they have a set of
&gt; screw extractors, which each fit into your electric drill.  The
&gt; extractor has a small blade-like device which, when your drill turns it,
&gt; cuts down into the head of the screw, and supposedly removes it.  The
&gt; set costs $40, which seems a bit much to remove 16, (I have four
&gt; pop-outs) screws.  I did get two others though.  One is a drill like
&gt; device.  You drill a small hole into the top of the screw head, thread
&gt; this device in, and it is supposed to grip the sides of the hole you
&gt; made and back the screw out.  Didn't work, it just made the hole
&gt; larger.  The other operates on the same principle, it is square and you
&gt; make a hole and then turn it and it's supposed to back out the screw.
&gt; Also didn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that the tiny $%&amp;#_at_ screws were not made to be removed.  I'm
&gt; about ready to fill in the window holes in my camper with plywood.
&gt; Anybody got any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
