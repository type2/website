&lt;&lt;Hi Isaiah,

You're right, many people think those were aftermarket. A lot of campers
ended up with those. I've seen them on many EZ Campers. They have three or
four chevrons (arrow heads) stamped on them going up the non-mirror side.

One of those cool things that you can tell people who are oh-to-happy to
point out the &quot;flaws&quot; in a bus! :)
