This reminds me, when I first dismantled the engine in my bus shortly after I had bought it, the heat riser tubes were plugged - i.e. the holes that connect to the exhaust were not drilled out - they had never been open and still had a thin piece of steel blocking the air. I drilled holes to open them up - is this the way intake manifolds come sometimes? Or was this a mistake on the manufacturer's part?

&gt; The heat riser tubes coming from the exhaust are there to counteract
&gt; this. If you notice icing on your intake, then maybe you should make
&gt; sure the heat riser tubes aren't clogged...
