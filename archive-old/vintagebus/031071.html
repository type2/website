&gt;again, i must express my thoughts---these are old vehicles.  they are not
mazdas, 6cyl passats, or even a (insert your favorite american car here),
...
my owners manuals clearly state: &quot; BEFORE YOU DRIVE AWAY (in big, bold black
letters) please check:  engine oil level, fan belt tension, quantity of
fuel in the fuel tank, tire pressures, efficiency of brakes, position of
the rear view mirror, and,if driving at night or in foggy weather,  the
exterior lights.&quot;
...
&gt;
Your point is valid but it says that crap in the new car manuals too.  ;p

Everyone should have the owner's manual to their Bus.
