Subject: Re: [VB] Little Miss Sunshine Drivein advance screening on the
  25th

Hey - You don't get a gas card, and it's not a drive-in, but it seems 
they are doing promo screenings all across the USA for free.  Maybe I 
can get a voucher for some free popcorn if I show up in my DC out here 
in CT on Aug 9th.  Anyone else want to get in and start a movement?

Here's a link to the list of promo viewings:

Too bad it couldn't be at the old Southington Drive-in, but I'll go 
early anyway just to see if any other busers are around.
