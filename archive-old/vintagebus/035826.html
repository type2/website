Well, this is probably one of the worst shows I've been to, and I've been
going to this show for almost ten years.
The show car turnout was pretty pitiful. About half of what there was over
memorial day.  There was only 4-5 busses in the show, including the
participant area (not judged)  
Some outrageous prices for people thinking they have something important.
i.e. 1963 23 window for ten grand.  Rusted out belly pans, needs pass. rocker,
full interior needed, but complete, needs paint, body work, and a complete
resto job.
About a 4k bus in my opinion.
A good turnout of bugs there as usual, almost no type 3's, one thing.
Sponsorship from vendors was a terrible turnout. But the guys selling peanuts,
sunglasses, and the like were there in force.
The swap meet was full like usual, one of the best things about the Sac shows.
Some nice busses for sale in the swap area, a few 21's, a 23, early kombi's,
an nice early hatch-top.
Lots of nice W-decklids, and a vert-W with a holde in it where the light goes
for $500, and it sold for close to that.
The typical people bringing out there vintage Schwinns and other non-VW stuff
along with lots of Coca cola coolers attached to everyone's wood slat roof
racks.
Not too many parts that I was looking , since most of cars are relatively
complete.
I found a nice set of early rear bumper splach guards for my 63 deluxe.
Well, that seems to be all that I can remember from today other than it was
soooo damn hot and very humid.
Until next time
