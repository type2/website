Subject: Currency conversion~can this be right!!!?
To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Yee gats! Saw the question posted regarding inquiry if
the color on a bus was correct OG color. I followed
the link to the Japanese VW web site. Asking price for
two differing vehicles caught my eye.

Velvet green walk though westy 2,180,000 yen

Eriba Puck trailer &lt;rare!&gt; 1,980,000 yen

According to rate of conversion found at: 

http://www.celtic-vacances.co_dot_uk/m01/calc.htm

1 US Dollar (USD) = 116.53 Yen as of what date I
dunno...

The USD ($) price would be:
Westy $18,707.62
Puck  $16,991.32

Can this be correct? I am the LAST person to ever
claim being a math major so I recalculated and came
out the same. Dang!
