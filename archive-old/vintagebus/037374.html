Rusty Van Bondage spewed:
&quot;...be strapped to a heavy wooden chair
in a remote shanty shack in the middle of the Mexican
desert surrounded by psychotic/sociopathic Federales
screaming in Spanish about missing money and drugs as
they are busy pulling my teeth out one by juan with
rusty pliers and attaching jumper cables on my
testicles. Broken windows and missing sections from
the roof with Sonoran sun streaming in like a laser
beam with only the sound of hot wind and screaming for
miles. &quot;

Damn,
I believe you are spewing this to the wrong list.....you should have clicked on alt.mexi-gringo-bondage or sumpin'.
I really think you should keep those sicko fantasies outta here,  some people actually read these posts.

Anyways.....bus content:
I drove my 63 to work today..as always.....runnin like a scalded dog down the 15 at 65....Robert Earl Keen yappin on the new CD player.....just don't get any better than that boys,  too bad i was going to work =(
