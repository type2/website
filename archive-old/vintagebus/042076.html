It's the component of cola beverages that give them a tang without tasting
like citrus.  This is why a nail placed in Coca Cola will dissolve over a
few days.  (the same nail placed in your own stomach acid will do the
same, only faster!)

The jelly works pretty well if you are patient and give it time to do a
good job.  You then need to rinse, dry, and paint to keep rust from
recurring quickly.
