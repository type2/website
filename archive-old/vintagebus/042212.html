&gt;
&gt;Or has the url http://www.type2_dot_com (vintagebusreflect) been performing
&gt;like a total POS for the past half week? WHAT gives?

The connectivity to type2_dot_com has been somewhat flaky.  See the below
from our volunteer sysadmin, David Raistrick.  The box itself is up 
and running just fine, but access to the Web pages is slow to nil.
Both mailing lists (vintagebus and type2) are working OK and sending
and receiving messages.

When the new server is purchased, it will go back to the Seattle-area
data center that type2_dot_com lived in up till a few months ago, so it
will have &quot;real&quot; network connectivity and bandwidth - this is the
access fee Ted mentioned in his message.

A bit of history: Shortly after the earthquake in Seattle earlier this 
year, type2_dot_com developed a hardware problem.  It was shipped back to
Georgia and David patched it up enough to work, but it required enough
TLC for a while that it was not shipped back to Seattle.  The type2_dot_com
disorganization had been contemplating a new server anyway, and decided
that this would be a good opportunity to make the change.

Thanks for bearing with us!

Hey folks.

Yes, effective around 9.40pm Eastern 5/31/01 the website started acting
up.

It appears to be a problem with the (borrowed! big favor i pulled) DSL
circuit we are camping on.

We hope it goes away over night....if not a: there isnt much we can do,
since it IS a &quot;best effort&quot; service, but b: we will put in some
bitch-n-moans to the isp involved...


So, yeah, you'll prolly have slim luck getting to the website.

Mail should still be working ok (other then the aol-digestion thing.)

....david
