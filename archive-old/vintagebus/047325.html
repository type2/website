you applied the tar to the perimeter of the rubber just before you install 
the windshields?   I'm spraying my bus this weekend and soon I'll have to put 
the glass back in and
I'd like to keep the water out (who doesn't, right?!).   
In the past I've used a caulk gun with tar and it was really tough and quite
messy, so I'm open for a new technique. I may try my Kool Patch, I still
have some left from my roof job.  Ev&gt;&gt;

Hi Ev,
Yes we do and we lightly paint the frame of the body to get that extra amount 
to seal it and allows it to lubricate the rubber making the installation go 
in slick.  Also we put a thin line of tar in the rubber seal in the slot 
where the glass goes so to seal the edge of the glass from water attack which 
causes that nasty white haze at the bottom of the windshield laminate glass.  
Make sure to set up the wire or weed eater line so as to start pulling the 
seal into the interior of the bus at center bottom of the windshield.  Then 
try to pull each end of the line evenly so as to pull the windshield/seal in 
equally side to side.   Eric&amp;Barb
