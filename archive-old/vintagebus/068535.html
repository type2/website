Hi Greg,
Got my bus bumpers straightened at Bus Boyz in LA, Cal.  They chanrge $100
each for just the blades, and they looked so good when I got them back, that
I hated to paint them.  You can get their phone # from Information, and you
can ship stuff to them and they will ship them back when completed.  My
bumpers took 5 days for them to finish.

Hope this helps.

Ed
