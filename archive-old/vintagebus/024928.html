I have a question for Thom and thers on the list with the CE safaris.

The CE safaris are nice and all but they lack the inner channel for the 
rubber.  I have 2 sets of frames here and was wondering if it would be 
possible to put in this channel or a portion of the channel to help the glass 
and seal to sit better.  Any ideas?
