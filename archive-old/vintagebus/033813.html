The Split Bus Club, a chapter of NEATO, will be hosting a campout May 7,8 and
9 at Collins Lake in California.  We have a group campsite reserved that is
away from the other campsites (don't want to scare the retirees in the RV
that is bigger than most apartments).  Hot showers are available as well as a
marina with boat rental, fishing, a sandy swimming beach, playground, and a
store.  The fee is $15.00 per Type 2 per night.  Collins Lake is about 10
miles north of Marysville.
We had 29 Type 2's at our campout in March!  I hope you can make it.
