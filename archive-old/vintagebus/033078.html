For this I would use a product in the form of a mat. This is a lot easier and
cleaner than spray junk.  here are a couple I would check out. The first is
called dynamat (sound dampening material) and is used mainly for sound reasons
and is  by car stereo enthusiasts you can order this from crutchfield
(www.crutchfield_dot_com).  the second is heat shield insulation from jcwhitney
(www.jcwhitneyusa_dot_com).  This is effective on retarding radiant heat as well
as sound.
both companies offer a free catalog but make sure you specify the vw catalog
&gt;from jc Whitney.
