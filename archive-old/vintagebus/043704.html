Subject: Re: [VB] How much oil?

&gt;I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there
&gt;is a spin-on filter attached to it.  I know to fill up the filter before
&gt;I put it on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill
&gt;up, too.

One cubic centimeter is one milliliter of water at 4 degrees Celsius.
Find the inside diameter of your oil line in centimeters, halve it to
get the radius, pi * radius * radius * length.  The answer will be in
cubic centimeters which for your purpose is equivalent to milliliters.
(Ain't the metric system cool?) If your oil line is about 1.3 cm inside
diameter (about half an inch), it will hold about 
3.14159 * (1.3/2) * (1.3/2) * (4*12*2.54) or 160 mL.  Or, about five and 
a half ounces, or less than half a pint.

Or you could just fill it until the dipstick says whoa like everyone
else has suggested.  :)
