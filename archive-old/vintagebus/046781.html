Hi Rex,
Correct!  It should take almost a whole gallon to fill the reductions and 
tranny center section.  While you are in there it is a good idea to install 
magnetic plugs in the RGBs and in all fill plug positions.  The more magnets 
there are the more steel shaving will be taken out of the oil.   Eric&amp;Barb
