Subject: Pulled my steering wheel

Pulled the steering wheel on my '59 a week or two ago. Here's the story.

-checked archives on methods
-bought a pulley for about $25 from sears
-ran out of Liquid Wrench, so used WD-40 to help loosen it up. This was
what turned out to be the big mistake.

I tried &amp; tried &amp; it wouldn't come off. I hit it with torch heat &amp; cooled
it with water. Nothing. I even stripped the craftsman puller I had just
bought!!!!! Frustrated 'cause sears was closed, I went &amp; bought some more
Liquid Wrench. I sprayed it in there real good &amp; went to bed.

Next day I got the puller replaced from sears &amp; called my little (big)
brother to help. Put the new puller on, tightened it up,.....POP!!!!! No
sweat. It came right off. He went home thinking I was a &quot;p***sy&quot;.

Lesson: Use Liquid Wrench, not WD-40. And in all fairness, it's my fault
for trying to make WD-40 do something it wasn't meant to do.
