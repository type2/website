Hi everyone,

     I cant remember if it was on the list, or if I read this somewhere 
else, but does anyone know, if on the 1967 beetles, (like mine), I heard 
there are holes predrilled (from the factory) for rear quarter pop-out 
window installation.  Just wanted to see if anyone knew if  this was true, 
(before I took the time to look),

thanks,  Matt
ps.  Does anyone know of a fair double or single cab split truck near 
pittsburg, or in Pa (for sale)?  I also have a 66 bus for sale, but its not 
worth to much ($50 firm!  ;)  )if anyone wants a description, e-mail me, and 
I can post some pics if someone would be kind enough to let me know how to 
;) !

thanks,
