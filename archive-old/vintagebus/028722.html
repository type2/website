George writ:
&gt;I'm rather suspicious that cell phone use has suddenly become such a
&quot;safety hazard&quot;. Cops, truckers, hams, CBers, and taxi drivers have used
2-way radios in their cars for years without causing carnage. &lt;
Hmmm.  People who know how to drive and have most probably gone to school to
do it as part of their job.  Most experienced drivers I know will not use a
cell phone and drive.  Hands free is different and what I would consider to
be perfectly safe, there are cell phone cradles that are pretty cheap (Radio
Shack probably) that I encourage everyone to get if you use a cell phone in
the car.  Trust me if SUV drivers got out on a skid pad or autocross track
they would trade them in the next day on something with a lower center of
gravity or slow their cruising speeds dramatically.  Just because you &quot;feel&quot;
like the car is not going fast does not mean the laws of physics do not
apply.

The soccer mom typically driving around my neighborhood area can barely
handle the big SUV as it is, much less with a cell phone in her hand, a cup
of fresh Starbucks, and two undisciplined kids in the back.  Or Mr. Tough
senior VP of BS in his big bad SUV and clean manicured nails who may go
camping once a year and considers himself an outdoorsman.  Ha!    

From what I have personally seen, the majority of wrecks (I refuse to use
the incorrect term &quot;accident&quot; - it is purely driver error) or near wrecks
that I see are caused by cell phone users.  I see drunk drivers on the road
from time to time but I have never seen one in a wreck.  What is the cause
of the majority of wrecks you all see??? 

I know the big automakers predict expanded sales in the SUV market, but a
lot of friends that we know are going back to normal cars or minivans.  I
think people maybe going against this SUV trend finally.  There are nice
German 4 wheel drive station wagons available that will beat the SUVs in
everything except towing capacity, then again how many people tow with a
small SUV anyway?  The towing crowd has a full size trucks or the full size
SUVs not the light weights.

No blast on the 4Runner, but the last time I drove one I almost flipped it
get onto the freeway on an on-ramp by mistake.  Those big tires make a
hell-of-a-howl around a turn and good God the center of gravity is high on
those things.

In my 911 I know it is safe at 90MPH on  the interstate, in the bus and old
Ch*v* truck 60MPH is all I want/can do safely.  I like to drive fast in the
911, but when I have an SUV pass me I know they are just taunting death and
really could not control the car in an emergency situation.... Hmmm, like
the Firestone blowouts.  It is ridiculous for drivers to loose control over
a blowout!   If you disagree go to driving school and then tell me I am
wrong.

Also the 4-wheel drive will get you going in a straight line in bad weather,
but is of no use when stopping or turning.  Centripetal force cares not
about drive wheels, especially with a higher center of gravity.  I think
this is why so many non-experienced snow/ice drivers end up in the ditch...
I have spun 4x4 truck before on ice, usually just goofing around, but once
the traction lets go you are just out there swinging around until you hit
something to stop you.

I encourage everyone to join your local SCCA club http://www.scca_dot_org/ and
learn what your car can do before you hurt yourself or others.  Most of us
here are car nuts so I imagine we as a group drive better than the average
driver, but maybe pass the tip onto that bad driver who insists on driving
at lunch, scary!
