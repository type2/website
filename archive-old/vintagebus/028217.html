I would also add that you had better like it in the condition you find it in 
cause finding original parts to replace missing or broken items is just about 
impossible.  

As far as functionality they are kind of like a Westy - Sleeps two medium 
sized adults, or four small kids, or six drunks.  Pucks are great for one 
person or a couple but no more.  I have three kids so the Puck serves as mess 
hall during the day and Hilton for Mom &amp; Dad at night while the kids sleep in 
the attached Westy tent.  By the way, Bay window Westy tents mate up 
beautifully to a Puck rain gutter and look as factory to a Puck as they do 
the bus they were originally intended for.  I know Puck's weren't sold by the 
dealer but you can for sure tell they were made with VW in mind. 

I'll ditto any positive comments towards any small camping trailer.  Thanks 
to a lead from fellow listtee Rick Taylor I also have an Applby trailer which 
with its red and white striped canvas tent looks as VW as any VW tent I have 
seen.  (..and the genuine Westy campmobile tag I put on the ass end of it has 
fooled more than one &quot;guru&quot;)  Between the Puck and the Applby I have saved 
several hundred dollars in hotel bills while attending shows.  Cheap to the 
end.  Guess I'm a true VW enthusiast.
