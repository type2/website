&gt;  &gt;  Red light suddenly on very bright.  Gets dimmer when engine is revved.  
&gt;  &gt; Can
&gt;  &gt;  anyone give me some guidance here?  I can barely fit my head in to see 
&gt; into
&gt;  &gt;  the top of the generator.  I pushed on the part that holds the brushes, 
&gt; but
&gt;  &gt;  no spark at all, that I could see.  The brushes feel tiny, almost not 
&gt; there,
&gt;  &gt;  I think.  Are they going to be locally available?.  Funny how I have 
five
&gt;  &gt;  cars, and in the course of two days three of them become undriveable, 
&gt; just
&gt;  &gt;  when I have to go back to work.
&gt;  &gt;  
&gt;  get out your idiot book.  The electrical section is total crap, so dont 
try 
&gt; to use it for diagnostic, but it does show you how to check/change brushes. 
 
&gt; If the brushes are below the top of the holde rthey need replacing.  
&gt;  
&gt;  12V brushes are about $8 a pair I think now.  were $3.50 when I first 
bought 
&gt; them $6 in Nevada po dunk town.  Always carry a spare pair. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Use a Bentley (even a bay one) for the electric section, but I still find 
&gt; the gen diagnostic section less than clear.  hella better than Muir though.
