&gt; I'm about to install the distributor drive pinion on a new longblock.
&gt; 
&gt; The book goes to great lengths to say the athe engine must be lined up
&gt; with TDC
&gt; and that the slot on the drive pinion is in a very specific position.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon reflection, is it REALLY that important that the slot is lined up
&gt; exactly?
&gt; If its not lined up exactly (like off a few degrees) can't the
&gt; distributor merely be turned to
&gt; point at #1 to compensate?

If you're running a vacuum-advance distributor it does make a
difference, as the vacuum diaphragm will interfere with other parts if
the slot is in the wrong position.  On some distributors, #3 is
retarded, making only one arrangement of plug wires &quot;right&quot;.
