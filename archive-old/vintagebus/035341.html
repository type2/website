Ron,
I have just had time to read your short version of your European trip. Great
fun. Thank you. While I have not camped in Europe, your story reminded me of
my several trips in many ways, which is good. 
My wife and I adopted the point of view that we would enjoy without judgment
observing how other cultures had solved the same basic people and environment
challenges that we take for granted here in the USA. Everything from clothing
to restaurants to the hours that stores are open to the design of houses and
public buildings to money systems to public and private manners to how public
restrooms are used to how roads are built, maintained and driven on and many
more change from country to country. Most of them are different from the way
that we were raised with and comfortable with, but the &quot;locals&quot; feel the same
way about ours. Once we figured out that it was necessary to discover the
local differences and adept ourselves to their way when we were guests in
their country, it got much less stressful. There are several travel books on
the customs and manners of individual countries that most travel stores stock.
Made a big difference for us. 
There are many examples, but as a serious driver, the most striking thing that
I learned was that you must observe how the locals drive and DRIVE LIKE THEY
DO.
Specific examples include the severe lane discipline in Germany. Speed limits
don't matter there, but DON'T EVER PASS ON THE RIGHT. Everyone in Germany
seems to lag a bit starting out from a green light. Don't go faster than they
do. In Holland, the roads look just like neighboring Germany, but the posted
speed limits are enforced. The Swiss and Austrian roads are beautiful and well
maintained, but the local farmers use them at very low speeds. Watch for farm
animals on all roads.
But in Italy things are truly special. In Italy, road building, and the
placement of lines on roads is a public works and jobs program. There are
posted speed limits as well but no one takes any of this seriously. The
country has averaged more than one major government change each year since
WW2. The speed limits, lines on roads and other things that are very engrained
in the minds of other Europeans and Americans mean much less here. They are
important only because they give jobs to some citizens. They are otherwise
totally ignored. Passing occurs anywhere. Speed is up to what you think is
safe. Parking and turning obey rules established centuries ago. If you learn
to think and drive LIKE A LOCAL (here and every where else) this stops
bothering you. It becomes enjoyable local culture to absorb. This can be
tough, but it is hard to enjoy being in Europe otherwise. IT AIN'T LIKE HOME.
That's why we go there. 
And then there is Naples to the South. Everyone STOPS for green lights and
GOES on the red ones. As weird as it sounds, IT WORKS. Since everyone local
stops and looks at every green light before they go, and every one ignores red
lights altogether, everyone assumes responsibility for their own safety at
controlled intersections. That is everyone but the tourists who show blind
trust that they can go at green lights. This is the biggest cause of accidents
in Naples. 
My summary is that Europe is a great place to visit because so much of our
culture came from there. But THERE isn't much like HERE. That is why I like to
go. I learn something every time, and feel broader for the experience.
I certainly agree that this sort of trip is an example of why we should each
be careful not to put off too long something that we always wanted to do. And
there are many more examples of this lesson closer to home. Such as taking
that long trip by splitwindow bus here at home (obligatory bus content).
Thank you again for reawakening pleasant memories. The beer and food over
there are unbelievably good. And thank you for the great service I have gotten
from your business.
