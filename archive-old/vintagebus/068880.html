&gt; The Grand Canyon isn't in a city.  It cuts through about half of northern
&gt; arizona!
&gt; 
&gt; From Las Vegas, you might want to go to the north rim.

I believe that the north rim is closed for winter!  It's about 1000 ft
higher than the south rim, spectacular, but closed until they plow the road
in the spring.

I would second the idea of Zion National Park-158 miles from Los Wages-open
this time of year, and even tho it's in Utah, home of the &quot;whacko
survivalists&quot;,  pretty cool. Lots of climbers, river &amp; desert rats hang out
there, but this time of year is the perfect time to see it.
