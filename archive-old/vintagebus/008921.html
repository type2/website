&gt; &lt;&lt; Is there really any point to trying to convince someone to drive their
Bus
&gt;  year round?  Part of having a Bus is not having society's values crammed
&gt;  down your throat.  Unless I'm mistaken, owing a Bus is not even a
&gt; pre-requisite
&gt;  to joining a VW club &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Your just mad cause you know you dont drive your bus all the time.

Hahaha, I haven't been mad in almost 10 years.

I don't measure someone by how much they drive their Bus or New Beetle or
Honduh riding mower or whatever.

Sure, I don't drive my Bus all the time, there are 2 other cars available to
me plus a bike plus my feet.  I like my Bus best.
