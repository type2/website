I'm considering building a &quot;covered storage area&quot; for lack of a
better term, both to cover the parts that must live outdoors, and to 
cover a potential project bus.

I have a concrete pad on the side of the house, next to the garage.
It's 13.5' wide.  What I want to do is make a wood-framed top cover
for it, using that corrugated fiberglass roofing stuff.  It would
be ~20' long, 10' high, 13.5' wide.    I wasn't planning on 
covering the sides.

I rent, which is also an issue.  I'm willing to eat the cost of 
materials and labor if it means my bus would have a dry home.

My questions:

* Do I need a permit (I'm in Citrus Heights, CA, but I assume
these rules are probably similar elsewhere)
* What's the best way to attach it to the sideof the house?
* Anyone done this before, and can offer suggestions?

Thanks!

Thom
