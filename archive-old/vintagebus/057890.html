&gt;&gt;Wilson recommends a cure for warped overheated cases damaged by detonation
&gt;&gt;or run without the cooling fan:
&gt;&gt;&quot;Sometimes , such excessive heat practically remolds the case so the bores are
&gt;&gt;drastically out of line. To save such a case, torque it together and bake at 425 F
&gt;&gt;( 218 C ) for two hours. Then turn off the oven and let the case cool to room temperature.
&gt;&gt;Don't move the case while it's cooling. Once cool, repeat this heat / cooling cycle.
&gt;&gt;This will actually reshape the case to where align-boring the main and cam bearing bores
&gt;&gt;is possible.&quot; 
My rebuilder tried this a couple of time a few years ago. He said the cases lasted about a year and the studs started pulling out. 
He may not be a &quot;Wilson&quot; but he does build many very fine motors. Of course other peoples experience might be different.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Additionally, welding is a viable repair solution to broken magnesium and aluminum alloy cases.
&gt;&gt;Welding, as you know, puts intense heat into the parent material in a localized area.
&gt;&gt;This is a considerable topic to discuss. 
Certainly quality case welding by a qualified welder can repair some problems but that is hardly the same as a case bake. 
&gt;&gt;One further consideration to ponder, powdercoat is not ceramic.
&gt;
Maybe this is the coating process I was thinking of.
