Subject: Re: [VB] Adjusting a H30/31 pict carb

It was a unknown engine that was in the bus when I bought it. I tore 
the top end down and replaced the heads as they were shot. I bought 
stock VW heads. The head, deck, and shimmed displacement volume 
calculated out to be a compression ratio of 6.6:1. I have also 
checked for manifold vacuum leaks.

Thanks,

Rocky

&gt;A lot of overheating problems that can not be traced down to 
&gt;external influences are usually a result
&gt;of to high a CR.  Do you know who built your engine?  Did they do 
&gt;any CR calculation or adjustments
&gt;(barrel spacers, combustion chamber balancing, ect.)?  Just because 
&gt;you are using stock size P/C's and
&gt;stock heads does not mean you're running low enough CR.  When I 
&gt;calculated my CR on this totally stock
&gt;engine/heads, it came out to over 8.0CR!   Too high!   CC'ing the 
&gt;heads and them matching them to each
&gt;other, plus the addition of .060 shims under the cylinders brought 
&gt;me back down to 6.9CR.
