Subject: Stereo in a bus?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Since its Friday, I wanted to poll everyone about what sound systems they 
have in their bus. While I continue to work on the mechanicals of my recently 
aquired 67 Westy my mind wonders about what to do about the tunes. The stock 
radio is for looks only and the die hards. I want tunes. Used to be I never 
wanted a sound system always wanting to listen to my motor instead. 

So, who has utilized the space in the dash on their bus. who has a 
recommended stereo that fits and rocks!  Block off plate?, stereo on the 
precel shelf ? Best speaker placement? Want some ideas so that I can build a 
sound system with minimal alterations to my bus interior. See ya as I crawl 
back under the front end.

Thanks.
