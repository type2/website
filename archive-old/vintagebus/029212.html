Subject: Headliner

Ok I'm a sucker for the infomercials, I even bought Motor up one time,
engine started shaken so bad within 500 miles I had to replace it.

Any way to clean things like headliners and seats I like
OxiClean       it actually works, get it at the as seen on tv isle in
your favorite store.

Good Luck

Meredith
