Subject: Re: [VB] Rotating Bus tires

&gt; Question for the day, originally our buses came with bias ply tires and the
&gt; tire rotation was front to rear, keeping the lefts on the left and rights on
&gt; the right.  Nowadays, we mostly are running radials, so do we do the radial
&gt; tire rotation moving the rear to the front and the front to the opposite
&gt; rear?  Just a curious question to see what some of y'all do.

Bias ply rotation was from front to rear and side to side, so every tire
eventually visited every position.

Radials were the ones that only wanted to rotate one way, so they have to
stay on the same side of the car (unless you want to flip them around
on their rims!)
