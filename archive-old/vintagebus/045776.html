TODD WROTE:


Hi Listees,
 Harry Houck recently had a shin-dig to welcome a '65 21 window to
his family. While there enjoying his hospitality and very tasty homebrew,
I learned from he and Karl (who is also from the list) the whereabouts of
a '62. Although it sounds like it is pretty much stripped (including a
LARGE drivers side clip that Harry has taken possesion of) it still has
its drivetrain. 

 So my questions are: what are ALL the pieces I need off this bus
to bring mine back to stock? Are there any odd tools that I will need? How
hard is it to take out the front beam?
 Right now my '62 has the rearend out of a '68 T3 (I think that's
what the DPO said) 
- - - - -
It depends on how it was lowered.  

  Sounds like the rear was lowered by putting in a no reduction box trannys,
so you come either switch trannys, or pull your tranny, pull off the T3 axles,
flip the ring gear, and put on the reduction boxes and bus axles.    As you
will need to pull the motor, I would take it to the car wash first and clean
things up in their, and take this opertunity to change any leaky main or oil
cooler seals, maybe put in new fuel line, new engine to body seals, new tranny
boots,  or any other stuff that is better done with the engine out (switch to
doghouse cooler?  Install thermostat?)  and I'd put a new starter bushing in
too.   If you have all the stuff to pull the motor out,   you will also need
something sturdy to rest the bus on with the tranny out- I like a good chunk
of log under the tranny carrier better than jack stands myself.   You will
need 27mm socket (1/2 &quot; drive) to undo the tranny to carrier bolts, and
something to undo the 36mm axle nuts- a smash thingy or a socket with 1/2 inch
or even better 3/4 inch drive and a good slide bar and cheater pipe.    Think
about new brake hoses, as it'll be apart, and how are the rear brakes on the
tranny going in?   

How is the front lowered?   Drop spindles?  lowered/adjustable beam?  leafs
springs removed?   the way it was done will make the question easier to
answer.

I would take any and all spare parts off the 62 parts bus you can.  If you
don't need them now, you may later, or a friend may.    Including  doors,
panels, latches, glass, wiring harness, switches, wiper stuff, handles, brake
cables, lighting.    Hope this helps.

Clara
