I would have talked to the manager, but from others in the local area the 
&quot;word&quot;is that no one at that particular dealership is interested in talking 
to anyone who appears under tha age of $60,000/year. That and their parts 
dept. doesn't want to even be bothered with inquires of purchasing parts 
(not that I would want to buy at dealer prices but it's nice to find out 
how much you're NOT paying for those exhaust clamps).

I have gotten many a salesman talked to on occasions, but I feel that with 
the base prices that car manufactures are asking that it is their &quot;just 
desserts&quot; to be plagued with incompetent boobery.

Just my opinion
