Subject: Middle seat for my bus?
Message-ID: &lt;D9CB5761FF19D3119981006097076011015144_at_PA2EXCHANGE&gt;

I'm risking all at sounding stupid, but just got to know.  I just got my bus
back this past weekend and now will seriously concentrate on her
restoration.  How do you know what type of middle seat they came with?
Dharma is a 64 Standard, she has a bench up front and I have a rear seat
(its not bolted in), but she's got a big empty gap right in the middle.
Does anyone have one for sale they want to part with, or know where I might
find one?  Any leads would be appreciated.  Thanks and forgive the lameness
- it's my first bus!
