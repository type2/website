ok i just picked up two blocks at a swap
and an trying to look up the codes and am getting confused

heres how it goes #1   AH 215177
normally this AH would be 72 up 1600 but it only has 6 digit i assume the 7th 
could be a 0 and vw just omitted it.

#2   B  5007834

it could be a 70 but they start at 6000some thing
or is it a 68 with a B code
or is it a 61 and the B is just screwwing me up?
       dont you just hate it when the #s dont match up, if anybody could help 
i would be grateful.

thanks again
Jose
