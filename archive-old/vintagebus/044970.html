any particual year?  do you want a split window? do you want a bay window? or
even the dreaded vanagon? ::im on vintagebus i can flame on vanagons right::
do you want a camper? a deluxe? a standard microbus? or a truck?
do you want a walk thru? or a bench seat model?
what color do you want?
how much money do you have to spend?
how far are you willing to travel?
what ever you do dont stop looking. they are out there.  there should be a
bunch.  i think i remember of a vintage bus campout not to long ago in
Huntsville Al. RIGHT?  Wasn't that Redneck VW campout up in tennessee thats
not to far from north AL.    i bought my 1961 swivel seat camper in Alabama.
southern alabama.  look around.  ask people that you see.  even the ones that
drive bay windows. you would be suprised how many people beat up the bay
window and have a pristine split window at home in the garage.
LOOK LONG LOOK HARD LOOK FOR VWS!!! 
they do exist.
