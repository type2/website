Sounds entirely reasonable to me.  Looks like you're a hoopy frood who realy knows where his towel's at.

&gt; Well, not me, my engine.  I just installed an oil temperature gauge in my 66 ('71 engine w\1600 DP, 34 pict 3 carb, 009 Distributor, using 20W-50 oil). Anyway, after driving for about 20 minutes in 70 degree weather, the gauge only reads about 150-160 degrees. IS THIS POSSIBLE? I used the oil plug type sender, so I realize I'm probably going to get the coolest reading from this, but can it really be running that cool, or did I probably do something wrong? BTW, after driving, I pull the dipstick out and I can touch the oil and rub it between my fingers without any burning issues.  So, what do you guys think???
