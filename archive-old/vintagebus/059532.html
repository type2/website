Subject: Looking for gas tank parts

Hi Everyone-

I am restoring the gas tank on my 1965 bus. I need to replace the sealing =
washer that goes on the underside of the tank and keeps the threaded =
&quot;spigot&quot; from leaking gas all over the engine. I looked in my part manual =
and came up with 111 209 139 and 111 209 147A- any idea where I can find =
these parts? Based on the 111 number it appears that the parts are shared =
with Beetles.

Thanks!

Michael

&gt; Thanks for the interest.  I have not gon ahead with

&gt; preaty much there but there was not enough interest.
&gt; If i do these, they will be right.  If i do that then
&gt; i will have to sell them for the $3-400 range.  Most
&gt; of the feedback i got did not suggest that this price
&gt; would be attainable.

On that same note, I have a set of my Repro tent poles waiting for me. I
saw them today when I dropped off the 3 piece &quot;flap pole&quot; (Thanks
Ronnie!) to be done as well. These poles sets will have everything except
the roof mounts, I even had the bumper mount done. Problem is price is
going to be $500-$600 will anyone pay this? We'll see. If no one does at
least I'll have another set of poles when I find a complete tent minus
poles.
