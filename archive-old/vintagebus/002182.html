Ah, the good ol' poppin' outa 4th. Brings back memories.

When the tranny finally went in my '67, I ordered a rebuilt one from a
supplier in HotVW's (don't recall who, ~ $400) and after the swap I sent
them my old one for a core refund. This worked for me, and the tranny's been
running fine for the last 6 or 7 years. However....

My mistake was that I ordered one without axles, figuring I'd just put my
old axles on the new tranny....not so easy! Pulling the tranny is simple, as
is putting it back in. Swapping the axles turned into a nightmare. I don't
remember the exact difficulty, but I had to take it to a German mechanic
friend and have him help me. I also needed to order/do something with the
gears (ring, pinion?). Sorry I don't have more details, but I would
recommend ordering one with the axles installed if you are the average
backyard mechanic and don't want to open up the tranny.

Quick Fix: When mine began to pop out of 4th (I hated that, all of a sudden
&quot;pop!&quot;, engine tacks out, etc. -- kind of startling) I attached a bungee
cord to the rear of the drivers seat and adjusted it so that it would hold
the gear shift in 4th (not too much tension, but enough to hold it there).
When it comes time to go to 4th, put in the clutch, shift to 4th (it'll stay
with the clutch in), reach down (left hand on the wheel, eyes on the road!)
grab the bungee, hook it around the shifter, then let out the clutch. Not
having the time or $ to do the swap, I drove it like this daily for over a
year, even a few long hauls from Santa Barbara to San Francisco and back.
You get used to it - it kind of becomes a part of the normal shifting
process. Sure, your passengers might laugh at you, but just tell them what a
mighty beast the VW tranny actually is.

Good luck,
