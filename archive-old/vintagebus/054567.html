&lt;&lt; My engine code is &quot;0 619 293&quot;, Which, as far as I can tell doesn't match 
up with any engine ever put in the transporter line, (or any vw type, for 
that matter?).&gt;&gt;

Hi James,
From about halfway through the 64 model production of buses JAN64 the 1500cc 
engine was standard for the N. American market while most of Europe ran the 
new 1300.

&lt;&lt;My engine codeis &quot;0 619 293&quot; &gt;&gt;

That should be a late JUNE64 manufacture, which is a very late 64 model.

 &lt;&lt; Also, what is the difference between the long studs and short studs in 
the valve area..I've heard there is a difference when adjusting valve 
clearances. &gt;&gt;

Since you have a 1500 this is not a problem.  Only the early (1961-63ish) 
40HP engines had the long studs.  So you have short studs.
