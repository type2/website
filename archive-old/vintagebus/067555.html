Subject: BYOB Pictures

To the few who've emailed me regarding pictures from past BYOB events, I apologize 
because I haven't gotten them posted on our new site yet.  They'll be going up this 
afternoon and should be ready for consumption by evening...in the meantime, search 
the Samba and VBDC for other people's pix.

I also neglected to mention in my last email that whether you're camping, swapping, 
showing, or just don't want to leave your bus outside...the Red Barn will charge you $10 
to come inside the gates.  They're folks will be running the gates, so hang onto those 
reciepts!

-Taylor
