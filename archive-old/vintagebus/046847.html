&lt;&lt;  has been said of this bus....


 &gt; I have a standard unmodified transmission and standard unmodified
 reduction
 &gt; boxes on my bus. The engine is a 1600 dual port. It will do 70mph all day
 &gt; with no problem and up to 80 on the flat. Do you need to go faster? Then
 &gt; have a special trans made up with a higher ring gear ratio.

 I am having a little trouble with this. I my bus was like that I would have
 no prob. In fact it might be a bit quick for me. &gt;&gt;


I too have a 1600 DP and stock trans and reduction boxes on my 67. I also see
70-75 all day and 85+ on flat ground. I note 75 to be about 4300 rpm and 85+
to be about 4600. the oil doesn't get over 210 at 75 even on hot days, just
with the dog house cooler, but if I try 85+ for any period of time, it starts
climbing and I slow back down. maybe with an external oil cooler and the
thermostat vanes back on I could cruise at 80+
this is part of the reason why i have the front sway bar, a camber
compensator and front discs.
