Hi list,

Along this line, While I know what Muratic acid does to rust, what will it do
to glass.  Can I just toss the whole window in and let it eat the rust or
will it eat the glass also.  It has worked great on many small parts and for
removing rust and corrosion from electrical parts, but what will it do to
glass.  Anybody know.

Another idea, has anybody tried sandblasting the screw area of the window
frames to remove the rust and let what ever lubricant access the area
easier?  Just Curious.

Thanks,
Aaron
