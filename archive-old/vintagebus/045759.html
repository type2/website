Subject: Vent window Locks
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My vent window locks on my 67 westy are long gone so I was trying to remember 
where I had bought some vent window locks that I had placed on an earlier 
bus. My 72 bus had these  locks for extra security. I cant remember where I 
bought them from so I wanted to ask - &quot;Does anyone know where I can order 
these locks?&quot; Also can I use them on my 67? Rmember these are not the factory 
vent window latches but an after market vent window lock. 

Thanks.
