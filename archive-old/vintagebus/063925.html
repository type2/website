Subject: Re: [VB] 009 with 30-3 Question Again!

&gt; I set the timing at 5 degrees at idle but some years in the dummy
&gt; book show 7.5 degrees advance

The distributor is what dictates the timing as long as you are talking about
conventional VW combustion chambers.  Different years had different
distributors, therefore, had different timing specs.  Change your
combustioin chamber to something custom, and your timing requirements change
as well.
