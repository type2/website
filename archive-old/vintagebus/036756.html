Subject: This here clutch problem

At a minimum I would order the crosshaft repair kit - bought my last one from
RMMW, but also got one from Bug Stop
in pleasant hill, ca once.  kit should have both left and right crossshaft
copper bushings, new return spring, two new circlips
a nice new outer metal sleeve type of deal, and some rubber parts as well.
Compare the eyehole where the clutch cable attaches - is it straight or curved,
use the 66 for reference. While you're at it, consider new clips, TO bearing,
cable, chatter tube and cable boot, maybe even a clevis pin and definitely fresh
trans fluid.  After you have all that - figure out how you're
going to remove the old right hand bushing - it can be difficult. good luck
