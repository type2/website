look i get at least a hundred emails everyday, not to mention scanning the
postings on the list, etc etc, and i handle it, i reply to all messages
immediately.

as far as $58 for mirrors, geez what should they cost?

jb

&gt; Well, first of all I guess for $58 you can't expect too much. Also, I
would
&gt; have called them rather then E-mailed them about the problem. They
probably
&gt; get 100s of e-mails a day.
&gt;
&gt; However, that doesn't excuse them from some responsibility here. I believe
&gt; that if they are going to use the list to advertise then they face the
&gt; consequences (on the list) of their poor service and deficient product! I
&gt; feel you should reveal them so that the rest of us don't fall in to the
same
&gt; trap.
