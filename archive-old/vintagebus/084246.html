Subject: NC Thanksgiving Misgiving

Hi,
I though I was done camping for the year but Octoberbus got me all
fired up to go camping some more. Thanksgiving Misgivings seems to  be
an option but where? Is there still one going on in Columbia,  SC? I saw
the posts about the Oconee SP, SC event and it looks  really nice but I
don't think I could take Friday off of work and  that leave a 520 mile
round trip drive to camp one night.

Jamie, Chad, and I were talking about it last night and thought   maybe
we should put something together in our area. Is anybody in  NC
interested in getting something together? After a quick  discussion we
came up with a potentially good location: Van Hoy  Family Farms
Campground (former Octoberbus site) in
Harmony, NC just an hour or so from Greensboro, Winston-Salem,
Charlotte and Boone.  The web site is

http://www.vanhoyfarms_dot_com/

In the past we have camped in the hollow behind the Coliseum (shed
amphitheater) but there are no hook ups back there. We could camp  in
the area in front of the Coliseum that has hookups and use the  wash
facilities behind the stage.

The proposed date will be Saturday the 19th of November but we  could
camp Friday night as well if people are so inclined. If there  is any
interest in doing this let me or Jamie know. We can call the  campground
and find out about the cost and make arrangements.
