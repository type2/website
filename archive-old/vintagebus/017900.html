Hi. A friend of mine is selling a really super-clean 1963 bus. It was 
brought over to the US sometime within the last few years, so it has 
euro-spec taillights, no overriders on the bumber, kph speedo, etc.
It has had all the body work done right (new rockers welded in), and is 
all clean and shiny all around. Currently has strong engine, new brakes, 
new front end rebuild, new KYB shocks, new muffler, and everything works 
electrically. It was a dove blue kombi, but was repainted white over blue. 
Interior is a really well crafted homemade camper set up.
Basically you can hop right in and start driving with no worries for a 
long time. 
Bus is in Raleigh, NC. Asking price is $5000, but that's negotiable. It 
is currently in the way at my friend's shop, so it needs to go soon. 
E-mail me for more details, and I can put you in touch with the owner if 
you wish.
