Any listees live around Pensacola FL? I'm heading down this morning to
visit my dad and do some bus hunting while he's at work. Anybody know where
there's any good stuff down there. I'll be taking the Golf because the bus
is on jack stands for a while (plus my 4 year old likes it better, she just
hasn't come around yet). If you live around there give me a call after Sat
afternoon (it's a 15 hr drive from VA Beach) the number is 334-987-5508.
Later,
Jason
