&lt;&lt; how do I get off the 8 bolts (4 on each side) that hold the RGB's to the 
spring plate?  I gather from other posts that these are easy to break off, 
and I don't want to do that if I can avoid it.  I've been hitting them with 
PB blaster, but so far, the still don't budge.  I have a cheater bar but I'm 
hesitant to lean on it too hard.  Any suggestions from the masters of 
fasteners? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gordon,
We have yet to break off those bolts.  Stripped plenty!  Take a hammer and 
rap on each bolt several times and then just use a 1/2&quot; or bigger socket 
wrench and a cheater bar to get them loose.  Once you do have everything 
apart make sure to drill and tap those RGB mounting bolt holes much deeper so 
you can later install 40mm long bolts instead of the stocker 25mm long ones 
that strip threads all too often.  With the RGBs off the tranny and apart is 
the best and nicest time to do this modification!
