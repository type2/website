I believe that the small mirror has been around the whole time and came 
equipped on a lot of buses. But I believe that the elephants were an optional 
thing, better visibility. Those terrible truck mirrors you see BOLTED to the 
doors (one bolt in the belt line and the other in the window frame) of buses 
were also an option. I have two boxes from Volkswagen that elephant ears came 
in and I believe it says Genuine Accessory.

 Your '67 should have elephant &gt;&gt;
