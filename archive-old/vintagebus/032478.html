Here in Houston we are a little short on decent shows to go to. We might have 
2 this year (if the weather cooperates) So, my friends and I have decided to 
try and put on a &quot;good&quot; show for March or April of next year. I know that 
several of you have put on successful shows and I would like to know what 
does it take to make a show a success? I realize that big attendance helps 
but you don't get that without have a decent show.
So, if I could get some feedback from everyone....  What makes a good show? 
What makes you want to go to a show?  I'm shooting for a grassy location for 
the show but if not, are parking lot shows less desirable?  How can I get 
people to go?
Thanks,
Brian
