&gt; I'm planning on taking the bus off the road this winter for a complete resto 
&gt; so ain't gonna worry about it for now, but I'll have to come up with 
&gt; something to fix it! Anybody have any suggestions?

Hi Jim,
Yes we do!  Fix it now or make sure to plug the heater tube both under and 
inside the bus off.  Otherwise you run the risk of sucking in carbon monoxide 
into your interior, and slowly brain deadening you and your passengers!
