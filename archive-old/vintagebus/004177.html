&gt; Submarining is when you slide out of your seatbelt into the
&gt; footwell...  Picture the seatbelt being the waterlevel and your body being
&gt; a submarine submerging.  Racers put an anti-submarining strap between
&gt; their legs...
&gt;
&gt; What happens when you have the seatbelt anchor below your shoulder i know
&gt; not a name for, but if you hit something hard enough that belt will crush
&gt; your shoulder like a twig and cut into you in a very damaging manner.
&gt;
&gt; If you have a setup like this, undo it and use lapbelts only.
&gt;

Regarding Seat Belts/Shoulder Belts,
I have no desire to be submarined, but on the other hand, a heavy webbed
belt running up between my legs is sort of intimidating...
My 66 SO-42 has heavy web belts, and non-retracting shoulder belts, the
heavy-web aircraft style belt with manual length adjustment. I have M-code
425 *Seat belts &amp; Mounting Points*, the shoulder belts are anchored aft of
the entry doors with a plate/bolt/nut setup through the reinforcing area
around the door frame. I'm 6'3&quot; and the shoulder belt anchor is just above
eye-level when I'm seated. There is a metal cap (looks original, matches the
body color) on the outside of the bus where the anchoring bolt goes through
the body. The seat belt buckles have the Wolfsburg castle on them and the
webbing is a light beige color. They give a very secure, snug fit, but being
non-retractors it takes some time to adjust for each passenger.
 BTW Steve, did you get those curtains made yet?
