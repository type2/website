Subject: Where to cut to make SC truck

My efforts to find a &quot;pristine&quot; single cab split truck had gone nowhere.

Good news today! A guy told me about a deluxe sitting in a home garage in
North Carolina just 15 miles from here! I went to look and it is beautiful.
Her Chinese grandparents bought the bus to drive to the market in Asheville
for supplies for their restaurant. When the suppliers started delivering on
the early 1970's, the bus was parked inside. There is no rust on this thing
as it has been in the garage since then. It has faded a bit but not bad for
original paint. It might be older as she showed me a thingy to stick in the
rear to hand start the motor? Never seen that before.

Anyway, I wonder where I need to make the cut to make it a single cab. I
might take it a little back and make a double cab &quot;binz&quot; whatever that is. I
will need to cut some plywood just right to seal up the rear. Looks like
those upper windows might get in the way of the cutting. Any ideas about
what type of caulk to apply to the wood for a good seal?

For $400.00, I cannot go wrong. I should be able to get some measurements at
EveryBus but really want to start cutting! Please help with advice or send
pictures. I have never seen a &quot;real&quot; single cab around here.

Thanx!
