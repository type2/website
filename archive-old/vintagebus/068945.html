&gt; (1)Are the window frames on the front doors of split buses from say '55 up 
&gt; interchangeable?

Hi Duck,
Yes they are only change in that timeframe is the slider latches through or 
not through the glass.

&gt;   (2)The front doors on my '58 are packed full of fiberglass insulation. I 
&gt; am assuming this is not a good idea due to water drainage...am I right?

Big rust problem!  Plus when the insulation is wet it is not going to 
insulate.
