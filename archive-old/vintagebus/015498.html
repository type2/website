Tom,
    I have the hubcap, and am ready to pass it on to you in Amelia Island.  
Anytime or day is good for me.  Also don't forget to mark your calender for 
Buses at the Beach.  It is on April 8th, Jacksonville Beach. There will be a 
strong turn out of single cabs and other commercials and splits. Drive 'Em
