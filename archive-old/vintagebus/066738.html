Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator Q

I once bought a new Bosch generator,  probably the first thing I bought for the
bus. About 5000 miles later the bearings siezed (no the fan belt was not too
tight)
and it would spin no more. Bus stopped, a long, long way from home. With local
help I got an original german generator from a bus that broke a decade or more
earlier. It worked! I put the brushes from the nearly new generator in it and
must be 15000 miles later and it's doing great. Don't dismiss the old parts so
fast, my opinion says they are often better than what can be had new today.


---Original Message---
I do appreciate all of the replies but with a new reg
running around $80.00 ( I drive my vw too much to
trust used electrical parts, especially when you never
know why the donor car was junked to begin with!) plus
the need to bend linkage, I will go with the other
alternator as it seems a better buy for the long run.
