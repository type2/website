&gt;Then 1961ish the pockets were discontinued, and a small steel zinc plated
&gt;bracket held the church key on the left of the left front kick panel.

I've got this little holder on the kick panel, but I also installed a 
second bracket just to the inside of the rear hatch holding a second 
key. This has saved on an enormous amount of foot travel as I can 
then just reach in a have access to this other key, when I'm so 
distracted I go aft without the key. I'd recommend this others. And, 
I've never had problems with it snagging luggage: Holder keeps it in 
place and out of harms way
