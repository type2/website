&lt;&lt; Street concours would be a good compromise.  I'm tired of seeing 
 &quot;show winning&quot; cars which are basically just a bunch of chrome goodies
 and cheesy display props.
 
 This begs the question; who is qualified to judge this?  We've already
 seen how clueless a lot of the current judges are.

who judges the current shows?   vintage meet we have  public judged and owner 
judged classes, but no judges/points systems.  I have no idea how other shows 
are judged
