Subject: Is it camping season yet?

The reason I ask is that today, for the first time since March, I have my
bus back on the road. This past few months have been very frustrating for me
as I've had to get my bus ready for summer with very little actual cash and
some frustrating delays.
Last week, the self-employed mechanic who was doing the engine and trans
removal and reinstallation (at the rate of about three hours of actual work
per week), called me to say that he had it all buttoned up and ready to go,
but when he put it into reverse, the bus moved forward, and vice versa. As
it happens, the guy who rebuilt my trans, out of habit reversed the ring
gear upon reassembly giving me four reverse gears and one forward. He was
very apologetic and took it upon himself to make things right, so tuesday, I
towed the bus out to his shop and this evening (thursday) he called to let
me know it's ready. In his defense, he's used to working on bus trannys that
are used in buggies, so there's no reduction boxes, hence the switched ring
gear.
There's still plenty of summer left and of course on into fall.
I can't wait to pile on the miles.
