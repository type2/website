It has been said of this bus....


&gt; I have a standard unmodified transmission and standard unmodified
reduction
&gt; boxes on my bus. The engine is a 1600 dual port. It will do 70mph all day
&gt; with no problem and up to 80 on the flat. Do you need to go faster? Then
&gt; have a special trans made up with a higher ring gear ratio.

I am having a little trouble with this. I my bus was like that I would have
no prob. In fact it might be a bit quick for me. I however am cursed with
the bus feeling comfortable at around 55-60mph. I assume this is
standard-ish as I have had several splitties and 80mph has always been out
of the question. What is happening here?
