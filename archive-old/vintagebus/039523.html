&gt;
&gt;Hey y'all,
&gt;I was wondering if i could get some advice from the all knowledgeable bus
&gt;gurus out there.......ya see i gots me this dope bus i i wanna do a few 
&gt;mods?
&gt;it's really funky,  it's got this huge decklid and no rear hatch, and this
&gt;really funky dash.._dot_cant put  my CD player anywhere!
&gt;1.  where can i find some of those coolie air scoops that go over the 
&gt;vents?
&gt;or should punch louvers all in that big ol decklid?
&gt;2.  its got these little funky arms that pop out by the door and light up 
&gt;up
&gt;when i hit the turn signals.....whats the best way to cover them up..bondo?
&gt;3.  i almost got rear ended last night.....i was thinkin bout cuttin some
&gt;bigger holes and puttin some trailer lights from pep boys in the back
&gt;4. whats the easiest and cheapest way to lower mah ride?
&gt;5.  it needs a little rust fixed on it....what do you guys prefer, that 
&gt;spray
&gt;foam stuff or chicken wire?
&gt;6. last but not least...anyone have a  good template so i can trim the rear
&gt;wheel wells....it's such a pain to take them big ass tires off!.  i had to
&gt;trash them skinny 16 inch rims and by me some phat chrome empis!
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance!
&gt;how's that ronnie?
&gt;

Dont forget the shag carpeting, the huge bucket seats, paste glow in the 
dark suns and moons all over, paint it with housepaint, cuts holes all over 
the front for extra ventalation, cut out the roof for that cool tarp sun 
roof you always wanted, make a piss hole in the floor (saves time), replace 
that stupid steering wheel with a nice 5 inch wheel you stole from an 
arcade, throw the bumpers in a ditch (who needs them), add a quick shift kit 
and then a bowling ball on top of the shifter (its so cool to put your 
fingers in the holes to speed shift!), take those stupid ambulance fans out 
and put in nice squirel cage fans from a later bus, put diamond shaped 
windows in the sides, and finally take off that stupid emblem and put a 
black flagg sticker there. Its much cooler.
