Subject:  Re;Clarification

I must say just one thing it depends on how much of a stocker bus you have
to work with from the get go,  Yes custom requires thought, and lots of
trial and error. But if your fabbing from scratch parts you go through the
same  stuuf , MY main view is  If it was easy monkey's could do it. So far i
haven't seen Clyde the ape doing any buses custom or vintage.
