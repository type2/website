I'm also leery of annual inspections, as they can be a step toward
&quot;clunker laws&quot; that make it difficult or impossible to drive the older
vehicles that we all love.  Remember, new car dealers and mechanics are
the biggest supporters of inspection and clunker laws.  They don't support
them because they love your VW!

Yep.  Think of how many cool old cars and busses would still be driving around Germany if they didn't have the extremely strict old car legislation??
