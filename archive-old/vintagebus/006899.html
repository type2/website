Jerome is how far from Havasu? like 75 miles or something. True test comes 
when you drive it to Busses and Balloons in Albuquerque. Every show us NM 
guys go to is a mim. of 1000 mile round trip. Your lucky to have all the
cool 
shows with in 600 mile round trip.
Sounds like your close to the ultimate set up, I'm glad you take time to do 
experiments so we all can learn.
You da man.
I want extra taco sauce at Jerome taco night.
