Wow!

Even better than last year (which was my first).  Enjoyed meeting 
some the listees and seeing Thom's bus.  Octo was like sensory 
overload for me.  OCTO seemed to me to be pretty well run - well done 
to youse Orange County guys.  The Classic, OTOH was less well 
organized (I thought), but I was able to pick up a few parts. One 
disturbing discovery this weekend was finding out that the rear 
window in my 67 Crew is incorrect!  Somebody grafted in an older 
style!?

That was the only bad news.  This was my first trip in a bus and was 
sort of the shakedown cruise for the Crew.  Ran like a top - and even 
managed to more or less keep up with traffic (thanks to 15&quot; tires, 
and new gearing!)

Well done to all, and thanks for a good time!

BTW, I haven't given this as much thought as Dr. Thom, but there are 
some bus folks out there a couple of standard deviations from the 
norm!  To me there seems to be an inverse relationship between how 
pristine the bus and how far off-center the owner!
