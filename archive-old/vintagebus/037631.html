Subject: Help restoring truck gates


     
     I need to have my 63' Double Cab's gates restored.  They're in pretty 
     good shape: no rust, a few dings, the back one is only slightly bowed 
     out.  But the PO drilled holes through the top edges and installed 
     snaps for a tonneau cover( how chic ).
     
     Anyways...I'm looking for a company or somebody who can do an 
     excellent job of filling these holes( NOT with Bondo ), and 
     straightening, prepping and primering my gates.  
     
     Preferably in NORCAL.
     
     Any help will be greatly appreciated.
     
     -Jeff
