Got that beat.  I spent almost 2 hours, 3 window jockeys and a supervisor
(who was very helpful) total, to get to the point that I thought I was
finished.  Three weeks later I get the whole package of documents, Xerox of
the plate and a nice little form saying I need to get the plates verified at
my local DMV before my request could be completed.

Uh....I'd done that when I first went there.  That was why they copied the
plate and sent it in with the form.  Still waiting to go back to DMV and
revivify the plates and send the whole mess back to Sac.

PS: Anyone have any theft problems with the vintage plates??  I'm planing of
zapping a small bead of weld on the back of the bolts that hold the plate to
the frame and bracket to the lid.  Very small, but it would prevent the nut
from being taken off.  Just grind it off if you ever had to take it off.
Just a thought.
