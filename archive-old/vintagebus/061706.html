Subject: Re: [VB] paint stripping?

That's a name you don't see much any more, but you can still buy it at
your local FLAPS.  It is just a very aggressive grit polishing compound.
 It usually comes in a tin like wax.  You use it like you would grades
of sand paper, buffing compounds, etc..  Start with the most course
grade and go finer.

Automotive painters use more refined versions of this when they &quot;buff&quot; a
car out.
