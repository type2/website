Subject says it all.  I hate to do it but, things are to a point that I MUST
sell my van.  It's a 66 panel, non-walkthrough, 12V, 1600dp, daily driver.
There is no rust, needs paint and a slight bit of body work.  Have some
parts and things to go with it.  Sorry, no pics but, Eric and Beto know the
van and can vouch for the condition.  Make me an offer .  It's here in Vegas
driving every day.
