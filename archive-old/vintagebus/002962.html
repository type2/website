Heyya list

thanks for all that horn info.  That idea about pulling off your horn and
connecting a light and pressing the horn button to see if the light comes on
and thereby determining if the horn itself is the culprete or if it is
something else is a great idea. Though I didn't use it.  I just went to the
local VW wrecker and bought a 12 volt horn - works great - though I did like
the renault horn it sounded kinda unusual.  Anyway I'm a honkin' up a
storm - it works great.  I did notice on the french horn that there was an
arrow on the back with an &quot;R&quot; I think that pointed to a bolt.  Maybe that is
what I would adjust the point gap with? hmmm - I did take it all apart and
clean it and it had gaskets in it that I replaced.  Guess I'll keep it and
see if turning that bolt makes the horn sound.

Anyway, thanks for the replies
