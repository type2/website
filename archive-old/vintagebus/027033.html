Subject: Re: 56 Hearse--

I do not know who or where the 56 hearse went to on
E-bay--But--&quot;Drakula&quot; our 63 VW Hearse with just 26,000+KM and in near
museum quality--is still safe right here in Phoenix--When Drakula
arrived here in 1997 he had 19,000KM--so you can see he has been driven
a little bit more in the 2+ years in America than his previous 24 years
in Germany--together with our 4 other VWs.--Bessie our 67 does have a
complaint--Twice someone has tried to steal her front emblem--and of
course bent the nose and messed up the paint--&quot;they&quot; did take her vented
gas cap!! But i guess that is the reward for being on the Glory
Road--TWWM, uj
