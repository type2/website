Joy,

If you've got everything put back together right and you still can't get
any clearance between the screw and the valve, then you probably do need
to start planning to do some engine work. Valves that have stretched out
that far are a good sign that the engine has had a lot of hard miles put
on it and needs a valve job (not the same thing as a valve adjustment).

The good news is, you can still go to the campout. 8^) Just find a
couple of thin flat washers with an outside diameter close to the size
of the stand that the rocker arms bolt to. Take the rocker arms off, put
the washers between the head and the rocker arm, put the rocker arms
back on, and readjust the valves. You only need to do that on the head
that needs more clearance. Use washers that are as thin as you can find
and the same thickness. Plan to do a valve job soon. If the engine has
more than 50,000 miles on it, you are already overdue. Don't wait until
you drop a valve, like I did. It's more expensive to fix then.
