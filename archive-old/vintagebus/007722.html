A couple of years ago I went to Terraserver_dot_com and located satellite and
aerial photos of our neighborhood.  This site/service has images from US
sources and from Soviet satellite imagery.

As it happened, a Soviet image was the clearest, and I was able to identify
our old '68 Westy and our H*nda parked at the curb in front of our house.
It was quite a surprise to see how detailed the image really was, and also
how many times we'd been overflown!

Quality and resolution of these images varies widely, largely due to
lighting conditions, but the &quot;good&quot; ones are very good indeed.  The problem
is that by the time it's available on a website the data is at least a few
years old.

&gt;&gt;  I always thought it would be cool to get ahold of de-classified
satellite imagery and scan it for buses in bfe.  I could write a crude image
recognition program to isolate frame with potential buses, then search those
frames by hand.  &lt;&lt;
