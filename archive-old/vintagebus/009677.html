Subject: Engine removal with 2 ton floor jack?


&gt;I have never done this before. Muir says to use two scissors jacks and a
&gt;block of wood. Is it possible to use a floor jack?

&gt;Hey Brad, the floor jack is the tool of choice, I'm sure others will tell
you this too. I've pulled mine twice and the second time was incredibly
easier than the first. I put my bus on two jackstands to allow enough room
to crawl under the engine and remove the two lower nuts, and the upper left
hand bolt.
Then when the starter was removed, I slid a long 2X6 board under the center
of the bus lengthwise to provide a runway for the jack, my patchy driveway
makes it hard to roll the little wheels on the jack with the engine weight.
The first time I used thin plywood and the jack wheels broke through. With
the runway in place, I took a small piece of plywood on the pedestal of the
jack and centered the jack under the engine.
I took up the tension on the jack and wiggled the engine assy until it came
loose from the trans housing. Since I was doing minor surgery and then
reinstalling the engine that day, I slowly wheeled it far enough back to
allow engine bay access for me, then i set the engine up on two cement
blocks.
I have a friend who reinstalled his engine by setting it on his chest and
pulling the bus over himself, but I think I prefer the jack.
