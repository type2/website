&lt;&lt; I iwll have to check the page, it is in the tran removal section stating
 &quot;the main driveshaft must be supported when tran is on ground&quot;, and thyey
 recommend a block of wood. I am just trying to be certain I won't break
 anything by placing this trans, assembled with rgbs in my truck for
 transport for 5 some hours.&gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
Best guess at that would be if they are talking about moving or storing the 
tranny with the nose up in the air and the bellhousing against the ground.  
Since the inputshaft is a bit longer than the bellhousing it would stick out 
and pressure would be applied against this.

&lt;&gt;

Shimming between the axle tube and the tranny center section is really easy 
and quick to do.  It is the crown gears to the fulcrum plates and upper axle 
shove handles that takes time and often spare and new parts to get right, but 
that can be done way before your trip.  The worse time consuming thing you 
can do is to put the RGBs on the wrond sides!  The one big thing you can do 
to improve your RGBs is to drill and tap the RGB mounting to the Swing plate 
bolt holes deeper and use longer than stock mounting bolts.  The stock length 
bolts are too short and after all these years of stress the threads in the 
holes often strip out!  If you do the drilling and tapping while the RGBs are 
apart it is an easy job and if you drill a bit too deep you can have the 
holes into the gear housing rewelded back up.
 
&lt;&lt;On another note, replacement of my spring plates is necc. Adjustment and 
install have me slightly stumped. I understand I must mount the spring plates 
ahead of tranaxle install? Is adjustment only possible then with 
transaxle/rgbs attached to spring plates? If I have to press the plate onto 
the torsion bar, with the long bolts/cover, how to I effectively adjust this, 
remove, move, install, measure, move, rinse, repeat? Therfore, I must avoid 
an intital install of the spring plate on the lower stop? It seems that I 
have the option of installing the spring plate in various positions on the 
torsion arm to begin with, does this matter in the adjustment process? Is it
 possible to get adjusted or close with the trans NOT installed? This step 
confuses me, mostly since I have never done it. I have the tool to compress 
the plate upward on the way, but for beyond the removal process, I am 
stumped.&gt;&gt;

While you should be able to install the swing plate with the tranny in trying 
to adjust the plates without the tranny and RGBs in place plus the engine 
wieght will throw your measurements out to when the bus is all together.  
Hopefully someone on the list has had more experience with the swing plate 
angle correction proceedure and will help out with better info!
 
&gt;&gt;Rancho then ships the rgbs apart, and the axles are attached by moi to 
trans, the tubes (attached to rgbs) are placed on axles, insert bearing, 
clip, assemble boxes? Just trying to be best prepared for this process.&lt;&lt;

Yes, they have done that in the past, but recently we did hear that they have 
been having trouble finding usable RGB parts for bus!  You probably will have 
to find RGBs out your way to rebuild.
 
&lt;&gt;

Sure you can get 70MPH with a 4.12 R&amp;P (We have been able to get our 63 KG up 
to 90MPH at 5,000 RPM, but it is happiest and runs cool at 65 MPH at 3,000 
RPM!), but you will be doing at least in lower four thousand RPM range unless 
you install really big tires maybe having to cut out the rear wheel wells for 
enough clearance.  At 3,000 RPM with a 4.12 R&amp;P you should get about 55 MPH.  
We are very happy with the 3.875R&amp;P freeway flier especially with today 
highway speeds and fellow hot headed drivers.  We use a counter wieghted 69mm 
crank, SP unleaded heads, 1641 engine with type 4 cooler in the doghouse 
shroud, and oil filter/pump in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  
   Clara has a 1600 with a 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier tranny and she does not 
have the power we have with our setup.  Her engine has an uneven running 
feeling also.  We wonder if installing a CW would help her alot.
  When we started with buses we started with 25&quot; diameter tires instead of 
the 27&quot; dia. stock size for 55-early 64 bus and up till now have run these on 
the front axle.  Interestingly with these smaller tires on the front axles of 
both our 63 SC and 60 Panel camper have been absolutely the same speedometer 
wise to each other and also with our 63 KG running 5.60x15 type 1 stock bias 
ply 25&quot; dia. tires with NOS trip speedo.  With these 25&quot; dia. tires on the 
front of our 60 Panel and 215/75R15s (27&quot; dia.) on the rear we got 67 MPH at 
3,000 RPM.  Now with 205/75R15s on the same rear we get 63 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  
235/75R15 got us up to 72 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  We recently installed a 3.875 
R&amp;P freeway flier tranny and  205/75R15 radials on both axles in our 63 SC 
and now the speedo reads 58 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  We are still running a big 
bore 40 HP engine in this truck and once we build up another CW SP 1641 
engine for it we will experiment with the bigger rear tires again.  From what 
we have found with 25&quot; diameter front tires the 4.12 R&amp;P  only has half the 
increase of MPH with bigger tires as to the compared to the 3.875 R&amp;P. In 
otherwords if one gets a 3MPH increase going from a 25 to 27&quot; diameter rear 
tire with the 4.12 R&amp;P, you get a six MPH increase with the 3.875 R&amp;P.
  Right now our 1960 panel with 25&quot; on the fronts and 205s on the rear:
1st gear 12 MPH at 3,000 RPM. 
2nd gear 13 MPH at 1,500 RPM to 25 MPH at 3,000 RPM.
3rd gear 25 MPH at 1,500 RPM to 44 MPH at 3,000 RPM.
4th gear 45 MPH at 2,000 RPM (Any lower RPM seems to lug.) to 63 MPH at 3,000 
RPM.
  Wierdly the 63 truck with 205/75R15s is the same MPH and RPMs in the first 
three gears and even the bottom 45 MPH at 2,000 RPM, but at 3,000 RPM at 58 
MPH.
