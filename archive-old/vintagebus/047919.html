&gt; Anyone cutting up a 62 or earlier bus/truck.  I need the front bench
&gt; seat mounts for my 62 double cab.  These are the two that are welded to
&gt; the bulkhead for the back rest and the front and rear ones for the
&gt; bottom.  Someone put in a 1/3 rd 2/3rds front bench seat and I'd like to
&gt; eventually put the correct one back in.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

just to make sure- the switch to the 1/3 2/3 seat was at the same time as the wheel wells changed.   so if you have the earlier wheel wells (flat) your truck came with the full width seat, If it has the flared wheel wells, it came with the s1/3 2/3 seat.   If your rear wells were hacked, they changed the front at the same time, so you can check there.
