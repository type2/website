Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Bus Model numbers

&gt;I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you...
&gt;
&gt;I keep the NEATO Old Bus Registry which has over 1,100 buses and over
&gt;600 M-Code tags.  I looked at the data to see what I could see.  No, I
&gt;don't know what 008 is, but there are eight buses in my database with
&gt;008 and one of them also has 762.  The buses have some interesting
&gt;characteristics and it may just be that your bus is a 214-RHD, but the
&gt;008 M-Code overrides the &quot;cargo doors left&quot; model.  Here's what I have:
&gt;
My Bus is a RHD Highroof walkthru with a slider on the drivers (right) side.
It was sent to Switzerland where a coachbuilder removed the cargo doors, 
and added in the slider. It was then put to use as a mail carrier for 
the Swiss PTT.
This is the 3rd  Bus I've seen with this conversion, and I've been told 
of a 4th, but haven't seen pictures.

I have factory photos of a VW built highroof with a slider, but it's not 
a walkthru or RHD

&gt;I would certainly take your M-Code tag codes to add to my collection of
&gt;data.  I worked with Dave Eccles to help out on his book the &quot;Spec
&gt;Guide&quot; and always welcome the information from other people's buses.
&gt;  
&gt;
I'll get you my m-codes asap, and possibly the ones off the other 2 
Buses I've seen.

Greg
