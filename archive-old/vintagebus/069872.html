A mostly lurking Ellis writes:
My latest ratbus '63 EZcamper has scoops that are bondoed and painted into
place! I can't remove them without fouling up the existing many year old turkis
repaint. Each scoop is partly cracked (like the owner) and is begging to O.F.*
passerbys at the next campout. Photos promised for Friday.
Ellis lays claim to the origin of the new abbreviated common term &quot;O.F.&quot;
It is short for &quot;Oh, Darn!&quot;

I have conducted many Plasma smoke tests in my day. I have found that the
solution to side scoops is to pre-mix the air with multiple truck mirrors with
add-on wink dots. Maybe they are microdots. Oh darn... whatever.

Hahahah
