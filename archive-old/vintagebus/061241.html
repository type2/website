Subject: Re: [VB] POR-15 Advice Needed

Original, intact paint is the best primer.

Clean up the areas that have the rust, lay down the POR-15, and just when
it gets so it's barely tacky, mist on some primer (key word: mist)  Only POR-15
as much as necessary.  Prep and paint as usual, serves 12.

&gt; I've got some POR-15 on its way to me.  I have some rust up along my

&gt; to clean the area, grind it all down to metal, then apply the POR-15 to the 
&gt; specific areas.  The whole roof doesn't need it, so I'm planning to lay 
&gt; down some primer over it...should I grind the whole roof down to bare metal 
&gt; before primering...or can I primer over the old paint and the POR-15'd 
&gt; parts, too?
