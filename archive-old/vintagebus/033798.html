OK, why when it didn't sell the first time, why didn't the second highest 
bidder take the auction? I thought that was they it worked. And I looked and 
saw that sonicvw and jonny5111 are bidders on almost every one of his 5 
auctions and almost all the high bidders have low feedback profiles. I smell 
a snake.
