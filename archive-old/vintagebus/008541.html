An earlier version of the Washington State law on Historic Vehicle plates
specifically restricted vehicle use to &quot;shows, exhibitions, and parades&quot;.
Some jurisdictions were pretty lenient on this restriction, but others
[including the Wash. State Patrol] held to a very strict interpretation.

On the flip side, however, was the specification that ANY motor vehicle 25
years of age or older could qualify.  This resulted, for a time, in some
pretty peculiar combinations of vehicle and Historic Vehicle plates.

&gt;&gt; Here in WA State there are several restrictions applied to
&quot;Classic/Historic&quot; plate use.  The one restriction that is my favorite to
abuse is &quot;Vehicle may only be used for occasional pleasure driving&quot;. &lt;&lt;
