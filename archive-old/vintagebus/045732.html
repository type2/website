  &lt;&lt; It has has some kind of accessory oil cooler mounted behind the fan
 shroud and a full flow oil filter which flows from that via hoses around to
 sit near the left side of the carb then back. I've never seen this
 configuration(?) but then that isn't saying much. &gt;&gt;

Sounds like you need to rip off the fan shroud and pull off the adapter
the PO decided that he needed and reinstall a good factory oil cooler.
Get rid of the aftermarket oil cooler in front of the air intake on the
fan shroud so you won't pre-heat the air coming in.  I'll also lay money
that the PO decided that he knew more than the engineers and thier
millions of DeutchMarks in R and D and yanked the cooling flaps and
the thermostat as well.  If that is gone then reinstall.  In short, take back
to as close to stock as possible for long life.   Pick up a copy of HP's
book 'Bajas and Buggies' and take a look at what they say about this
type of cooling/filtration system. 
 
 &lt;&lt; All the mechanics around say a  minimum of $1000 to 
replace/rebuild the tranny. I think I could R/R it, but  the reduction 
gear boxes scare me. Should I part it out? &gt;&gt;

If its in as good of shape that you say it is then I wouldn't part it.
Don't be afraid of those big redux boxes- they're fairly easy, if bulky,
to remove along with the axles.  The transaxle is basically a Type 1
with a few minor modifications so it shouldn't present a major problem
for a local builder.   I think that the bid of $1K to R&amp;R the trans and
rebuild is about right if you also have to have the redux box bearings
replaced.  

Good Luck on your find!
