I agree with Tom. Our first bus was a brand new 64 and it was the station
wagon of choice for a farm family with (then) seven kids. My dad had his
severe words with it and the 40 hp motor which was repaired twice and
replaced with a 1300 later. It was the primary vehicle and it took us to the
grocery store, camping and hunting, and on a long vacation once. The
nostalgia never wore off and I have been working on them (engine wise) since
1969. People I know don't know me in anything else but a VW of some model.

&gt;&gt; It seems that years ago when nobody wanted a VW bus any more they were

&gt;&gt; they were taken over by the yuppie cult (driving up the values and
demand)
&gt;&gt; and as things continue to go on our buses seem to be taken over by the
&gt;&gt; computer geek (no offense to anyone, please).



.... I think Matt is pretty right on the money even tho he's only 29!!  As
an old fart (53) who was there during the og phases he described, I can
relate.  However, I think the one thread that runs thru all these eras where
buses are cool is that buses have always been DIFFERENT than the present
cultural values.  I think this is why the latest group that is thinking out
of the box, whatever that box is, is attracted to the type 2!  At first,
there was nothing else like a type 2.  Then GM came out w/ the Corvair to
copy it, but alas, they didn't have a clue, just like now.  Then  the Big 3
came out w/ vans and vans became part of the establishment, so the out of
the box people lost interest in them for awhile.  Then the Big 3 came out w/
minivans which became very mainstream, and volks saw how the og buses really
were ahead of their time, very different from the minivan, and thus became
cool again because they were DIFFERENT.  Then cars became very expensive as
safety features such as abs, crush zones, air bags, leather upholstery,
computerized fuel injected engines, &quot;mag rims&quot; as standard, etc. and those
out of the boxers again saw the type 2 as DIFFERENT, economical &amp;  a
statement that they saw things DIFFERENTLY from the mainstream.

Buses have always appealed to the out-of-the-boxers because they were
DIFFERENT.  Now VW is trying to capture that market, but unfortunately they
have not come up w/ something that is DIFFERENT, so I think they will miss
the boat like they have since the 70's, unless they start thinking out of
the box again.

IMHO,

Tom Buese
