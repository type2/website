&gt; Dune buggy houses sell &quot;heavy duty&quot; throwout arms that are stronger than 
&gt; stock.  These are a good idea.  Make sure that you get the one for a bus!

Hi Volks,
Good point!  The stocker TO arms were pressed into the shaft and a currant 
thrown through them to sort of spot weld them on.  With the heavier bus 
clutch pressure plate this is not adequate and will break off soon.  These 
stocker ones can be stregthened by applying a bead of weld around the bases, 
especially at the rear and sides of each arm.  Also make sure that the TO 
bearing arm forks are equal side to side from the tranny input shaft.  Other 
wise the TO bearing will get shoved side to side and soon wear out the TO 
bearing fork arms and allow the TO bearing clips to fall off due to less 
spring pressure with the thinning of these arms.  BTDT!!  You can Either shim 
the fork between the removable bushing and the right side C-clip or bend 
slightly the forks.  Those TO arm bushing made out of plastic and metal 
really suck, the earlier solid bronze ones are much better.  To center this 
bushing to the locking set bolt in the tranny, remove bolt and use something 
like a nail to locate the set bolt hole in the bushing.  Once found and 
centered, thread back in the set bolt.
