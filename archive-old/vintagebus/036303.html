Message-ID: &lt;7j6he4$jg4t_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

somebody out there must have a set of
early single pane camper windows
these do NOT have cranks (thanks to all who offered these)
the ones with cranks do not fit
these have a slide bar with slots that hold the windows open
also they are very light
late 50's 60 vintage
any help would be great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ps, working on the wireing, it has a 8 fuse panel
not 6 like the wireing diagram has on thoms page
but the wiring and colors are the same as the 6 fuse diagram

M CODES are
