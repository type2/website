Well I  pulled the engine, and found a broken washer, that appears to be
brown,  some type of stiff fiber. It was broken in two(with one small  chip
missing). It was lodged inside the area where the starter gear is. I'm  not
sure where it came from. The diameter of the washer matches the  diameter of
the throw out bearing.




hey kevin  I think that came off the starter. really won't hurt  anything  
later  mark dearing
