Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing screw holes for Deluxe trim

&lt;&lt;I have a deluxe in which I need to seal up the holes where the beltline
trim screws in because the trim isn't reay to be put on and I'm going to
be driving it in the rain. Any suggestions on how to keep the water
external?

Claras answer:

cut squares of electrical tape and stick them over the holes.   I did this on 
my bug, as the trim is AWOL.   I put my squares on diagonally for the stylee 
diamond look.&gt;&gt;

And little did you know Clara, that &quot;stylee diamond look&quot; also sheds water best.
