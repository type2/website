Hi,


I bought a '65 westy interior for my '67 split.
I have a few questions :

1. Are the 3 roof bows attached in the inner gutter just above
    the windows ?
   If yes -&gt; My bows are to short !!! (1 -&gt; 1 1/2 inches)
   If no -&gt; how and where do I attache them ?

2. I've seen in a parts catalog for a '67 westy that I need 2 supports
    for the roof panels and 1molding.
    Again : how and where do I attache them and what are the sizes
   of these 3 items (I don't have these 3 things, I will have to make
   them myself -&gt; What kind of wood do I use for these ?)

3. Is the top cabinet attached to the gutters ?   There are some (4) iron
    hooks screwed on the cabinet, but they are not wide enough to
    hang it in the gutters.
    Again : how and where do I attache it ?


Gunther
