Hi JD,
Definitely check out the archives.  Run a tach for 15 minutes to see and 
write down where each gear hits what RPM at what MPH.  Plus installing oil 
pressure, oil temp and keeping track of you MPG over differant conditions and 
RPMs is a real eye opener.  For us we have found that never going below 1,500 
RPM (To prevent lugging.)and only going above 3,000 RPM for very short 
periods to shift up a gear (Especially on hills!) helps keep the MPG up, the 
engine temp down, and the engine longevity about double.  Unfortunitly by now 
it is almost impossible to say what gearing is in your bus after all these 
years with who knows how many rebuilds or complete tranny replacements.
