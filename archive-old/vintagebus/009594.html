&gt;did you try greasing the moving parts?  My 59 has the same set up with the
&gt;metal tab on the support, and it does not screetch.

I did, but hadn't had it apart and by looking at it ASSUMED it had no
bushing.
When I finally ground off the coupling and got a look at it, it was obvious
it operated diferently.  I didn't grease it well up on top where the
springclip presses on the shift rod.  I think I'm going to try shimming the
new carrier down a little and if that doesn't work I'll grab my vintage
parts out of my vintage parts drawer and put them back on with plenty of
grease.

Thanks,
John
