Yes, if he key wafers inside the lock are worn this will happen.    A friend 
with a 69?  bus locked the bus with his keys in the ignition (oops) but 
luckily my bug key opend the drivers door.   It had a cutting similar to the 
bus' key, but only worked in the drivers door, no others.  Cause the drivers 
door will be used most and be most worn.

Replacing the wafers with new ones would be the best answer.  

It is also possible that some one removed some at some time?
.......................
  New question, I have my original 67 door handles and
just about any kind of key will open them.(other cars,
my house keys, etc.)  Is this something that I can fix
myself without knowledge of locksmithing or can a
locksmith fix this?  Do I need new handles?  Another
puzzle.  Does anyone find that after market vent wing
