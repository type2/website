&gt; Awe c'mon George, I store all my dry cells in the freezer until needed
because the cold slows down the chemical break down. I stick the
motorcycle batteries in the garage refrigerator after a full charge to
slow down plate degeneration. Best of all world is a full charge and
drain the acid, but that is tough stuff to dispose of with all the regs
around here!

Batteries don't work as well when cold.  Most batteries sitting around on
garage floors are far from new, and when an attempt is made to use them
they tend to fail rather often, as old, cold batteries are not all that
reliable.  That is where the reputation for concrete destroying batteries
comes from, IMO.

Let the battery warm up before using it, and you have a much better chance
of success.

Like I said before, the real reason is to keep the acid off of the floor!
