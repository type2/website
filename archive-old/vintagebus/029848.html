Subject: 5 speed tranny

Hello there,
Has anyone ever put a 5 speed (non porsche) tranny in their bus?  Is
there one that would require no hacking?  I believe that Berg makes a 5
speed for a beetle... could this be put into the bus?  Is it possible to
have a 5-speed tranny with the stock bus gears 1,2,3, and 4...and then
put in a higher 5th gear.. like a .77?  I don't know what the R&amp;P should
be...or what the best one to have in there would be either... or which
redux boxes to run...

Also...has anyone ever run an engine larger than an 1835 (say...a 2110)
as a daily driver and have good reports of it?  If so...what was your
setup?

Thanks,
Isaiah
