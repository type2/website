Ok,

Enough of this crap!

You guys act like YOU ARE GOD and can design __what is right and wrong for a
Human Being__ on how to behave.

If Bob Hoover:
  1) Wants to teach a newbie a lesson he won't forget.
  2) Copyright his work so he could later use it in another project.

So be it.  If you don't agree then listen to the other 1,000 people who have
a voice in this crowd.  Last I know, he wasn't kidnapping people and forcing
them to listen to him.  Most of you guys are bitching about the answers you
got when YOU asked him a question.

Geesh, are you the same type of people who regulate that I have to smile for
2.5 seconds at each person each morning?

Within context of a group, I feel Bob is great!  That doesn't mean he has to
be everybody's best friend.  I suspect that most of us have dealt with such
people in our lives and the fact that we refer to his writings as &quot;sermons&quot;
is a play that we all recognize he can be a bit preachy.  So what, he is
_different_ not _worse_.  Oh yha, unless you are God to judge.

Alas, I'm ashamed to see people point out his differences as thought they
are flaws compared to some mythical _perfect human being_.  Foolishness,
just the type of thing that runs off talented people like Bob.

Personally, I hate real friendly people who couldn't back up anything they
have to say.  Like 90% of sales people in the world.  However, do you see me
complaining about them, singling them out, as though they aren't perfect
people?  I suspect that Bob is more than willing to be challenged on any of
his often unusual conclusions.  It is my experience, in almost any field,
that &quot;common ways&quot; are not the best, and the people who have their own
unique experiences often reach unique and superior solutions.  In fact, they
often derive their own custom solution equal but different from thier peers
&quot;at the top level.&quot;

As for his personality ... learn to respect that there are different people
out there.  Don't project that you are better just because you are friendly.
There are a hell of a lot of technical people who would say your
friendliness plus $.02 is worth $.02 when a real technical crisis is at
hand.

On yha, unless you think you are God and can create an entire community of
people who are 100% friendly and 100% technical and 100% ...

P.S.  My personal experience is that Bob has been VERY helpful with
questions.  And I'm a VW idiot... maybe he respects that I have no
experience but I also take a bit of time to use more readily available --
yet maybe not the best -- resources before I ask him a question.  In other
words, I might have even read the Muir book -- or even just tried to FIND it
in the book -  before I decided I needed a VW guru with 30+ years
experience.

        At the risk of being ousted by the many &quot;Hoover-Followers&quot;, I will
be brave and stand up and agree with Rick and Michele.  Though Mr. Hoover
has been a super tremendous asset to V-dubbers as a whole, I am rather
disgusted with his belittling remarks.  Especially to the newbies.  Newbies
are the next generation and without them, you can bury our buses in our
graves.

        And the latest &quot;what I consider analness&quot; on the copyright stuff
takes the cake.   Not to put myself in any league near BH,  I have invested
tons of blood, sweat, and hours into our common love affair and offered it
to the World via the internet and anyone is welcome to steal it, take
credit for it, or sell it.  I do it for the good of our interests...not so
I have something to b!tch publicly to the whole list (that already knows
how touchy he is) about.  I think if you &quot;give&quot; something away because it
makes you feel good, you have no right to complain how it is used.
