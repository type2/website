&gt;Anyway, my question to anyone is: Can you recommend the ideal engine setup,
&gt;in terms of carbs, ignition, flywheel, clutch, trans, axle setup, etc. to
&gt;make this a super-reliable, smooth-running, hill-conquering,
&gt;casual-cruising, quiet-running sweet little honey of a daily-driver Kombi?

yes, for the results you're looking for I'd recommend keeping everything 
completely stock. :-0
