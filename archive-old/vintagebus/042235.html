&gt; &gt; George asks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I installed the new belt (is it me, or are the Continental belts getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; tighter?).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Was that  a new OE 9.5 x 905  Conti-belt, and are their very few if any
&gt; &gt; shims left for future adjustment?  Yes. You may want to put the 11,3X912
&gt; &gt; Conti belt on for a better fit and adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, that's my experience.  I added an extra shim to get the proper
&gt; tension.  I think that they're labeling 10mm belts as 9.5.

Replying  to my own reply...

Actually, my problem is that I had to put all the stock shims and one
extra between the pulley halves to get the proper 1/2 inch play.  I have a
feeling that a 11.3x912 belt will be even tighter.
