Hello everybody,

Well, my wife is out of town at a conference for her work, so that has left 
me at home with nothing to do but go to work, and then work on my bus.  For 
the past two days, I've worked on the bus from when I got off of work until 
the sun went down, and I couldn't see anymore.  It has been alot of fun to 
be able to work on it for consecutive days instead of a weekend here, and a 
day off there.  So this is what it's like to work like Thom...

I have made alot of progress straightening out my dented up nose.  I was 
kind of mad at myself for missing that ebay auction for the $15.00 nice nose 
piece.  The real bugger about it was that the seller was in Salt Lake, I 
could have picked it up, no shipping, but I didn't know it was going on 
until the auction was over.

Anyway, the nose is almost to a point that I consider good enough.
I'm doing all the bodywork on the bus, starting at the front and working my 
way back.  I've already replaced the drivers side of my front floor, and 
dogleg fixing comes next, then rockers.   Doglegs are rusty, but saveable (I 
hope).  Anyway, I am really enjoying getting some serious time in on the 
bus, and I'm learning that there are few secrets to bodywork, just lots of 
patience and time.

Anyway, thanks everybody for all the help.
