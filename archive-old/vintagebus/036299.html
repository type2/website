&gt; After 5000 miles of a nearly trouble free trip from Minneapolis to the Canadian Rockies, my fuel gauge became stuck at just over 1/2 a tank only 200 miles from home. I think it is from the tank sender as the needle in the gauge up front goes down when the key is turned off, perhaps the float is stuck. Anyway, is there a way to rebuild these units? Is it possible to
&gt; get them out without pulling the engine?

Tim,

Unfortunately, there's no way to get the senders out without either removing the engine/fuel tank OR cutting (shutter. . .) a hole in the cargo area directly above the sender.  I've done the later to my old '77 bus, but as any later model bay owner can tell you, pulling one of those motors/firewall/tanks is way more involved than pulling the same out on a splitty.  With good tools, it could probably be done easily in an afternoon.  Good luck.
