 Well i finally go around to pulling my engine today, It is always such a pain
 in the fingers/hand trying to remove the two top bolts, especially the one
 above the solenoid. It is like i need to eb a contortionist or
 something...
-----------I dont get this- usually )12V) the bolt has the half moon that 
stops against the starter so you reach inside the engine compartment around 
the fan shroud and undo it.  actually when I had a ratty bus that used the 
bolt hex head bolt I would vise grips the nut and use long extensions on a 
sicket to have teh swing of the ratchet clear the starter.  worked for me.    
 

its the top left one that is the PITA for me.
...........

anyway when i got ot the clutch it had oil all over it. Need to
 get a new clutch kit installed, it appears as though the front engine seal 
was
 leaking...i just replcaed this last summer. I don't remember where it was
 manuf. but i remember someone did a visual comparison of the different
 seals(based on country of origin) Does anyone remember which country made the
 best...which ones to avoid. 
 
 Any ideas as to why this seal would break, did i just install it improperly
 last summer?

did you replaced the rubber o ring in the FW as well.   hm- look at the FW by 
where it goes to the crankshaft, use a small screwdriver to pry out the o 
ring that circles the holes for the pins.  it should not be flattened on the 
inside.
