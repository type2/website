Subject: Re: [VB] Tom Conners' Roof Racks!

Hi Kevin,
I've been interested in a rack from Tom too . . .

Can you tell me how the new Powdercoat finish is?

How much did it cost to ship to you, and where do you live?

Thanks for your help,
Ed

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I just got my 6' rack today from Tom Conner.  Wow!...What a rack!  It is
&gt; currently the nicest thing on my bus.  I can't say enough.  Tom was a
&gt; pleasure to deal with, and his product is outstanding.  Thanks Tom!
