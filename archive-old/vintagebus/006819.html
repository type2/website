Ah Yes, Jerome, the tenth one, the first one of the new millinium, buses and
more, I have 3 buses to get ready to go, junk yarders, yes at 1 time, road
worthy, absoluty, safe and insured, pretty and ugly, unique and normal, they
will be there, that's part of the fun, they don't have to be pretty to be
there, I might even have the original paint (surface rust) 57 single cab
ready to go also, have many buses to loan for those that don't, have drivers
flying in just for the once in a lifetime thrill to drive a bus to JEROME,
yes it's that much fun, see all of you there, Remember Friday TACO night at
CAMPO de HAVASU presented by the LONDON BRIDGE BULLIS and I'm sure VWHoward
will be well stocked up on $9.99 a 30 pack beer with free pain aids for the
asking, but only available if your there.

But Jerome is once a YEAR.  Everybody knows when and where it is.  It's not
like it's a surprise, all-of-a-sudden, &quot;Whoa!  There's a show!&quot;

You have 365 days to get a bus together for the trip, minus travel time
from your destination.  

Why does it have to be an episode of &quot;Junkyard Wars?&quot;

&gt;I always look at Jerome as incentive to fix your bus.  It's a great time
for 
&gt;everyone to get together beforehand and help out to get a few busses road 
&gt;worthy.
