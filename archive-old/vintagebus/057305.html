Buy a pre-55 bus and AVOID this problem!

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I've diagnosed my tipper electrical problems to a faulty generator. So, I
&gt;opened up the shop manual (the red and gray one since I have yet to locate
&gt;an original VW workshop manual that covers the 67) and the first line I read
&gt;is &quot;Remove Engine&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Is this true?  Last night, I started in on this project and quickly realized
&gt;after I had removed the carb, taken the bolts/nuts off of the intake
&gt;manifold, generator pedestal, etc that I still couldn't remove the
&gt;generator.  Maybe Muir is right in saying &quot;watch how it gets more difficult
&gt;as the years go by&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Thoughts?  Is this the straw that forces me to just pull the motor and
&gt;replace it with a correct 1500 h-case AR motor?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;David
