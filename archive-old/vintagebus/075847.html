Subject: FS SO-34 interior -transportation

Hello Everyone,

This weekend is memorial day, come on a road trip to Utah, and pick up an 
SO-34 interior while you are at it.  For those of you saying to yourselves, 
&quot;Too bad I'm going to the bug-o-rama in Sacramento this weekend, or I'd go 
get it.&quot; Tom Buese of SLC has offered to bring the interior to the BOR in a 
trailer behind his '84 westy if you are willing to pay gas.  Now y'all have 
no excuses.

Not to the hotmail one.  This is my last post about the interior, thanks for 
the bandwidth.

Mike A.
