&gt; Some one found this pic of Bessie on the Internet ?? It came as news to
&gt; me--as I knew nothing about it !!

jerry, what are you going to do with regards to your discovery of bessie on a site for auto glass and services?

i am still trying to work out how i'd feel if i discovered images of any of my vws used as pieces of advertising on another site.

also, i got to be a bus without road-tripping with phish.

cheers,
