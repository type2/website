Subject: Re: [VB] 63 transaxle differences?

Stephen:

In 1963, VW offered the M216 option. Buses with this option were equiped
with slightly bigger rear drums and longer stub axles.  The gear reduction
was a different ratio than the regular non-M216 models.

These M216 Buses normally came with a 1500cc engine.  If you find a pair of
those rear drums, grab them. They are very very rare.

Thank You!

&quot;Customer service is not a department,
it's an attitude&quot;

&gt; I have lately become enamored of small nut transaxles, who knows if that
&gt; will last or ??
&gt;
&gt; anyway, i may have a lead on a 63 for a spare, but cant recall the exact
&gt; differences in a 63 transaxle as compared to 62 and older...
