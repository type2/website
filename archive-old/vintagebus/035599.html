&lt;&lt; Just a thought .......i had some brake problems that seemed similar to 
yours and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I would drive and one brake 
would lock up and light would also come on. I'd pull over thinking that if it 
cooled down i could go again. i wasn't the cooling down that allowed me to 
move again .....it was the pressure slowly work it way back into the master 
cylinder. what had happen was old rear brake hose inside wall lining was 
cracked (brake line hose has double lining) so it would build up pressure in 
between the hose and blow up like a balloon there by locking one rear brake 
smoking and eating up the shoe.
