Subject: Choke n me out!

Here is a very odd choke problem I would appreciate some assistance with...

When the vehicle is cold and the choke power wire attached it will not
start.  Pull the choke power wire off and it will fire up and run instantly.
Reattach the choke power wire and it runs fine like normal.

I am stumped as to why this would happen?

Right now I am leaning towards just disabling the choke altogether like St
Muir advises :)   I am not sure if this would affect drivability that much?


Thanks,
