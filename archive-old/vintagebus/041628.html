&gt; Hey Volks, I've been told several times to replace and
&gt; clamp my fuel lines. I got in the engine compartment
&gt; last night and I believe(not being a mechanic) that I
&gt; need to clamp the hoses that connect to the fuel
&gt; filter  as they are not clamped as of right now. Is
&gt; this correct? Any other places I need to check? Any

Yes!  Clamp those before you start the engine again!  All connections on
the pressure side of the fuel pump should be clamped, and most people
clamp all connnections.
