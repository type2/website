&gt; Hey everybody...
&gt; I have a 67 deluxe, which has the floor mounts for
&gt; seatbelts for the middle seat.
&gt; My question is: they look like they are a little ways
&gt; back behind the seat, so I'm worried that if I mount
&gt; seatbelts in there, people getting into the back seat
&gt; might trip on them. Plus, I'd have to cut slits in the
&gt; rubber floormat.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have these mounted? Is tripping a problem?
&gt; Or, has anyone mounted seatbelts (customly) to the
&gt; framework of the middles seat? Like, to the rear leg
&gt; of the seat?
&gt; That way you could turn the middle seat around
&gt; backwards (conference style) and people could still
&gt; use the belts.

I have mine mounted to the floor and there is no tripping problem.

It would be nice to have the belts attached to the seat.  My father's
C*evy van has belts bolted to the middle seat, but the seat supports
themselves are MUCH beefier on the Chevy.  You need two people to carry
the Chevy seat.  I don't think I would want to trust the seat supports of
the VW to carry crash loads.
