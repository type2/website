Subject: Re: [VB] Gas gauge installation

Personally I would put in some starter holes with a large drill bit, 
then use a Dremel to connect the dots and finish the opening to the 
correct size.

Be careful about exactly where you cut your hole.  The gas gauge has a 
chrome bezel that conforms specifically to the curvature of the dash. 
Put the hole in the wrong place and the gauge might not lie flat when 
you screw it down.

&gt; I bought an original bus gas gauge at a swapmeet last weekend.  My '58 does
&gt; not have the hole in the dash for one, but I was thinking I sure would like to
&gt; have one there.  Where would I take my bus to have the hole drilled?  I guess
&gt; this is probably not somethin I can do myself.  Carbide tipped hole saw?
&gt; Anyone, anyone....
