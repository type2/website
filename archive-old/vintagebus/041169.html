Hi everybody -

Yippee my bus runs again! I'm driving a bus! Now I am frantically
trying to get all those law and safety lights working before they give
the Freddies an excuse to pull me over for a little search and
seizure...

I've had good success with most of the lighting, but only limited
success with the turn signals and none at all with the emergency
flashers.

My turn signals themselves work fine, but the little indicator light
on the speedometer is giving me grief. It glows with the ignition off.
I think the trouble is in the relay, which I have only a limited
understanding of. X and L terminals I dig, but what is this P terminal
all about? And why does there always seem to be a low amount of
current present at both the L and P terminals? Bad relay? Bad ground?
I've checked for bad grounds, but I didn't find any. Maybe I missed
one. Can someone give me some troubleshooting advice, please?

And the emergency flashers? I'm stumped. It seems that I either need a
relay or a switch with more terminals in order to flash all four turn
signals together as emergency flashers but keeping them isolated for
use as turn signals. I keep thinking the solution might be in using
the brake light wiring to flash both rears as one, but I am not
confident that I wouldn't mess up my happily functioning brake lights.
I am really confusing myself over this one.

Thanks,
Joel

Ps. Does anyone have any experiences good or bad with those
transmission shifter locks? They seem like a fine idea, but do they
work?
