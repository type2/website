Story Follows:
A friend of mine was working on his bug at Claras house. I went over to help 
(err to BS) and he said he had a muffler for me if I wanted it.

Yep, ok the 63 has had a bad muffler for 3 years, now is the time. I got 
motivated, put the muffler on, and then wanted to fix the dragging brake 
caused by a bad rubber brake hose.

Took off the brake drum so I could have better access to the hose. (Fixing 
the brake hose was cake).
My drum however is very unhappy. Its very worn in the center, you can 
visually see it on the drum and more so on the brake pads (weird).
SO Clara looks at it and my axle stub and realises (to my dismay) that my 
drums are 63 1 ton option (I really shouldnt whine too much, its cool to 
have a 63 1 ton, right)?  This makes the drum a 1 year only optional 
part!!!!!!!!
Great I have a nice piece of UNOBTANIUM. (And UNTURNABLE-IUM).

SO::
If your brake drum lying in your garage cant fit on your bus and the last 
letter in the part code stamped on it ends in &quot;B&quot; I would like to hear from 
you.
