&gt;   I can't think of any reason why laminated could not be used. The original
&gt; glass could be used as a template for a custom cut laminated glass, since
&gt; tempered can't be cut after tempering.

Hi ya Roger,
    Just to comment, tempered glass can be cut the trick is heating the glass, but
as for laminated true enough its the prevention of shattered glass in an
unfortunate accident, tempered is used on areas that move so they won't crack when
striking the other surface.
  Do ya have catalogs from WCM or RMMW? they do have glass listed just in case,
also The Bus Depot is the greatest source I've ever found he'll get 'em from every
source available.  Good Luck.
