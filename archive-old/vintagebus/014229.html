Subject: [VB] Anyone want to buy a 'westfalia anhanger&quot; sticker?
Message-ID: &lt;19991208145424.259.qmail_at_www0q_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Hi All-

I am considering re-popping the &quot;westfalia anhanger&quot; sticker/plaque that would
have originally graced the back of westflia trailers/caravans circa 1964.

My sticker dude has told me that the minimum order is 20 stickers for $ ~
150.00 USD! Obviously I don't need 20 of them (especially at that price!) so I
am posting to see if there is any interest. I am not trying to make a profit
on these things but don't want to get stuck handing them out as christmas
presents either.

Sooooooooooooo.. does anyone have a better idea how to repop these things for
cheaper?

I have a digital image that is quite workable.

Oh yah if you have no idea what the sticker would look like it is similar to
the &quot;campbox&quot; decal that would have graced 50's era campbox westfalia's.

I think thom has a pic of the decal under the &quot;westy's &quot; section of his page.

P-mail me if interested.

Michael
