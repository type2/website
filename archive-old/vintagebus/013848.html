Subject: [VB] production plate info on 67 and an interior question (boring so 	 you may wanna delete:)

I just worked through the production plate info on the new 67. The decoding
info is available at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato/techdata.htm
:your freindly neighborhood NEATO website.

The plate reads 

20 6
425 081 114 130
UW 2512 434470 7140162

and there is a nifty sticker with the paint codes below it
Tizianrot L555
Beigegrau L472

If I am doing this right the info is:

20 6    20th June
425(universal ?) 081 walkthru 114 6 popouts 130 hardtop deluxe
U USA delivery W(a port of entry in U) 2512 LHD 7seater, cargo doors right
side
43 Titian Red 44 Beige Gray 70 mesh platnum
 7(1967 production) 140162 chasis # 

The interior of the bus is mostly there except the cab door panels. I would
not describe it as platnum(70) but more of a browish color. Is this what is
refered to as copper salt and pepper?
