X-ACNS-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Re: Tranny question

From: &quot;VWguy&quot; &lt;pickit_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

&gt;expect it). I was going flip them putting them back in. Which side gets the
&gt;wear, the long side facing the RGB or the side facing the pinion?

Archives.  Look for posts from Clara and Eric &amp; Barb, who gave me tons of help this past spring.  Just search for &quot;fulcrum plates&quot;.  Clara has a whole 
rap on swapping &amp; flipping them, checking for wear, etc.

&lt;grumble&gt;Not picking on VWguy in particular, but we need to be more aggressive sometimes about pushing people to the archives, especially when 
the topic has been so recently overhauled.  I contributed some bandwidth when swapping my tranny, true, but IIRC it was mostly &quot;can you clarify 
what I found in the archives?&quot;&lt;/grumble&gt;
