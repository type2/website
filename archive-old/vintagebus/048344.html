yesterday was incredible.    Dry even.  sunny, warm  must have been in the
sixties.  (And we like the sixties, right? )   hadn't felt that in a while.
So I have to mess with the safari bus, which has several names. 61 non sunroof
deluxe .    Haven't driven the thing much since summer, due to safaris being a
stupid idea and garbage and I can't drive in the rain with them so it has sat
under the carport most of the winter.     So I adjust the brakes.  Lo and
behold the parking brake works now.  Notice the steering box isn't causing all
the freeplay in the steering, the rear part of the drag link is contributing a
good share of that.   I bleed the front brakes myself, pulling the brake lever
down with one hand.   As it had been almost a year, I decide to flush the
system, so I pump it till the reservoir is almost empty, then wipe the
sediment out with a clean rag, filll it up, and finish the front
flushing/bleeding. 
     Then I worry about the lack of horn, and clean up connection at the horn
(which blares like a champ when hooked to the battery charger.  I trace the
bad connection to the horn button, which I have to disassemble, clean , and
reassemble.  The little chrome ring has tabs you can carefully pry back and
the center bit and the chrome ring come out of the outer bezel, and there is a
spring and a flattened conish metal thingy, and the spring and cone had
corrosion, and the bit on the bezel where the wire screws in -where that hits
the metal coe thing was corroded.  So I also carefully tap the cone into a
shape I prefer, it had been repeatedly pushed, mushing it a bit, I used a
swing lever pin for an anvil and a drift and ahammer, re assemble (carefully
pushing the tabs back with a screwdriver) and I tap the horn and deafen my
self.  Good.

Then I clean up the taillight connections, replace a couple terminals, clean
some grounds, etc.... I 'm feeling all proud.   One of the taillights had
become non functional- yes even on a 12V bus corrosion happens and can
completely block the flow of juice.   And the PNW is a very damp climate,
especially this winter.     After cleaning...  look - lights go on.  it goes
'beep!'   kewl.   

A neighbor shows up to see if I am done with the chainsaw and we talk trees
and putting stumps in creeks or not as the case may be,  Todd H shows up to
investigate bumpers, and  agrees to also help bleed the rear brakes,
hooray!!!!      After  the type of bus gabbing one falls into in the sunshne
-  I am again alone with my bus and grab the box of grey rubber and look at
the stuff around the cargo doors.  The old stuff is almost 38 years old, and i
scrape it out w/ a screwdriver and replace the seals there.   well, some of
them- the worst ones.   Hm, oil some hinges.

   I adjust the thermostat so the vanes are closed when the engine is cold.
Why did my ex put 10mm bolts in to hold the cover on under the thermostat?
when putting it back on I used shiny new scooling tin screws.     Duct tape
the heater box to tube connection, where it was not on there well.   Tie the
forward venting heater box lever ALL the way open.   Start it up- yea-  more
volume  coming out of the heat vents :).  Admire the new preheat flexible
tube I installed not long ago and the metal preheat pickup tube and
appropriate deflector tin for it.     I admire the pretty non rusty engine lid
and wish the rest of the bus looked as good.

The blue light for the highbeams had stopped working, and it turned out that
the bulb holder had come out of the speedo.  With a light and a mirror and
fiddling I get that put back in place and functional.     

okay.  that is all.  just that the old bus needed a few this and thats done,
and I wanted to share.     It is time to work the kinks out of the bus in
preparation for summer.  Maybe I'll drive it to Kelley Park-   April 11 is
this bus' birthday.
