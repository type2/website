&gt;  hey list,
&gt;  im pretty sure that my front tranny mount is bad on my '65, due to a 
&gt; clunking sound when i let out the clutch.  is there any way to replace this 
&gt; without pulling the tranny out?  im also leaking some oil and it looks like 
&gt; its coming from between the nosecone and tranny case.  i also see some oil 
up 
&gt; near my shift coupler which i just replaced.  hopefully this is all related 
&gt; to the same problem, but i just wanted some opinions or advice before i 
dive 
&gt; into this.  thanks!
&gt;  

does the shift stick jump around?   does the bus lurch?   can you grab hold 
of the fan housing and pull back and have the front of the engine (and 
tranny) tip up?  then sounds like a bad front mount.

you need to pull the motor out to chane it, and pull the rear wheel, pull the 
RGBoxes, apull the tranny back a few inches (you can leave the brake hoses 
connected) to get the old one out and get the new one in.   check the rear 
mounts too, they may help replacement.

if you want to reseal the nose cone at trans case pull the tranny all the way 
out, and do that.  the leak by the rear shift coupleing woiuld be the hockey 
stick seal in the nose cone, you you could replace it too.

bad front mounts can cause problems including cracked nose cones
