hmmmm.  Your right.  I looked in the manual when I went to pull the bolts in
the first place but I guess I didn't look at the quantity.  When ever there
is a double part description, I have found that in some instances it is for
a parts change over time and that if there was really a different part for
the same year, it would have been listed as a different part number and at
least shown on the exploded view.... but this is a bolt.

I guess I have to pay better attention!

&gt;&gt; I was looking through my parts manual just now from the Obsolete
Air-cooled
documentation Project and it lists this (these) bolts as #16 (page 257) and
it has a quantity of 3 of one (must be the Rasche) and then a quantity of 1
for the other.  The 3 are M10x50 while the 1 is M10x45.

There you go, is the one Dorn shorter than the others?  There must be a
clearance issue there.
