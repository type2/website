Any decent hydraulic supply should be able to build you hoses to your specs.
with fittings that do not leak.

However, if the oil pressure is so high that it's forcing leaks past
_properly_ assembled hose fittings you may be running excessively high oil
pressure with the potential to do damage elsewhere.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I discovered a new leak on my oil filter system. It had no leaks before
but now is leaking from the metal fittings on the end of the manufactured
hoses.  &lt;&lt;
