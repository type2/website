Hi Everyone,

I know the Dice Clay fans are saying &quot;Hey! He needed the money....&quot;, but the
Little Boy Blue I'm refering to is a movie on Cinemax last night.
I was channel surfing and came across this warped film...Only reason I'm
telling the list is because the story loosely revolves around an early
bay-window Westy. Throughout the movie, this bus is seen in the back of a
nastyville trailer house property, all broken down and abandoned. Towards
the end of the story there is a flashback that shows the bus new. The
filmaker used a correct pre-71 bus for the abandoned Volkswagen, but when
they did the flashback sequence it turns into a post-71 with larger
tailights and energy-absorbing bumpers.
I'm not a huge bay-window expert, so these were the only differences I
noticed....doesn't matter anyways cause it was a really cool film. The best
thing of all is it starred Nastassja Kinski (chic from Species), and I
consider her to be quite yummy.
Sorry for the low VW content...

-Tom
