Subject: Camper and Commercial Magazine

    GOOD NEWS, for those of you that don't subscribe to Camper and
Commercial magazine from England, I will be a dealer for it over here. At
this time I have an order for 10 copies and can up it with-in the next week
if there is a lot of interest.
   The next issue will out in March and I should have them even before
subscribers. I do not have an exact total of the cost but they will be 3.50
pounds (whatever that is in dollars) and post. I will divide the post up
between the number of copies and at that to the magazine cost.
    I have also talked to them about carrying Total VW also and if there is
enough interest I will bring those in also

  The March issue has an article on Dan Kinsey's Binz that was redone by
Kustom Koach Werks in Grand Junction Colorado.
