Subject: RE: [VB] Oregon Questions

I will admit that I do not know that much about Oregon but I took a 
trip there a few years back and was taken back by its beauty. I have been 
to Portland and the surrounding areas a few times and was really 
impressed. Troutdale, Gresham and a lot of other neat little zones are around 
there. When I think Portland I  think SF but real clean and with very 
cool people. My friend lived 20 minutes from Downtown Portland in the 
county! I mean horses and all, 20 minutes from a good sized city! Very 
cool. 
  
  From the Gorge we traveled to the Dalles and then south down 197 or 
97 I forget. I went through some of the coolest spots I have seen, 
Sisters comes to mind as a great little town that I could live in a second. 
I might actually be back through there this fall, returning from 
Yellowstone and Jerome.
 
I actually hope to move up there at some point.
