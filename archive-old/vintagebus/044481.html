&lt;&lt; Well, I originally wrote that it is a 1600DP.  Stock RGBs, tranny for the 
65 model year bus.  His
 tranny has seen better days, but his RGBs are still probably, in good shape. 
(No noted wear, or
 sounds)  Also, he is more into keeping the 1600dp motor setup, because it's 
easy to replace (more
 of them lying around than any other)  Intake, 32picts, heads, etc...
 
 He has a sufficently high speed, but would like to see the same speed with a 
little lower RPM. 
 More of what he's really looking for is to have more hill pulling ability.  
He frequently slows to
 25-30mph in 70mph zones, on highways and interstates.  Not that there is 
anything wrong with that,
 or that doing that is beyond the norm! 
=============
yes, that is odd.   While I do drop to 3rd on mountain passes, the only time 
I dropped to 2nd is if I got boxed behind a truck.  If you have to drop below 
3rd gear with stock 65 gearingand a 1600dp, something is wrong with your 
motor.   You should be able to pull a fully loaded bus up a twisty mountain 
road at 35mph, any road you can drive 35 because of the turns, you should be 
able to.  Time for a tune up/compression check? 

why do you say something is wrong with the tranny/ not the RGBs?  Symptoms?

then again, what is your gearing- who has the link to the turn the wheel deal 
to figure the numbers?

the thing is , to get lower revs at speed, you give the bus higher gearing.  
THis makes your bus more sluggish.   this is stuff I have done: 65 westy: The 
previous trans( in bus when I bought it) was 4.12 r/p with bug 4th 1.26rgbs, 
205 75 R14 tires,  zippier.  Tarns has grinding/ popping issues,   so after a 
while a got a rebuild  with higher gearing for the freeway speeds, right.  
When I put the 3.88 r/p into the 65, it got sluggy.  I didn' t realise that 
would happen.    But it is high geared.  70mph at 3500 rpms, but it doesn't 
do that up hills.  

Okay, I just swapped the 1600sp from my 65 westy w/ 3.88 r&amp;p, bus 4th, 
1.26RGB, 195 R14 tires to the 61 with 4.37R&amp;P, bus 4th, 1.25RGB,205 75 R15 
tires, and it has loads more zip. 

 if you have higher gearing, you want more motor to push it.       As NQ 
said, VW matched the gearing and the motor.   The gearing went higher when 
the motor went bigger.    they upped the gearing when they changed from the 
36hp motor.  The one ton package was HIGHER gearing, bigger motor, bigger 
brakes.   and so it kept going.  There has been absolute loads and loads 
rambled on about gearing, and what it does and rpms etc on the list ad 
naseum.   I'm going to build a 1679 with machine in ps/cs to go in the high 
geared bus.    or swap it to a 4.12, or put smaller tires on.

Though some people like to remove RGBoxes, that lowers the bus to do the 
type3 axles.  Some people think it's cool, I would hate losing the ground 
clearance.   Give me space to adjust the valves, change the oil, drive over 
rocks. That lowering topic has also been covered ad naseum.
  ==========================
 Contrary to what a few may have collected from my info, he has owned the bus 
for years, and none
 of us are &quot;new&quot; to the world of VWs.  Matter of fact, his father has been 
doing VW repair for over
 35 years, and now, he continues the business.  He's just never done anything 
like this before. 
 It's hard to explain all of this over the email list, and even harder to 
understand, by just
 reading it on the list!!  I do understand how I could have come off that 
way.  Used trannies,
 RGBs, and more are, generally, no problem to obtain and, really, he's got 
more than enough of them
 lying around to do whatever with.  Quite a stockpile over the years, you 
know?
 
 I guess he really wanted for me to post this on here, to get a good idea of 
what the vehicle
 actually runs like, after a changover.  We both figured that SOMEBODY on 
here had probably done
 the changout, and could give us any indication of what troubles they ran 
into, or how they like
 it.  Since the post and responses I've got, sofar?, I've been trying to 
still talk him into
 keeping the RGBs.  Like I also had noted, he's just looking for something 
new to do, as we're
 finishing up his wife's 66 Beetle...er, actually ,just waiting on me, since 
I'm as slow as next
 year's Christmas.  Just a little more tinkering to monkey with.
 
 Budget is $100 to infinite?  Instead of slowing to 25-30 on steep NE TN and 
NC slopes, he would
 prefer to only slow to 45 or so.  Because of the (later model especially) 
beetle gearing, he was
 hoping for just slipping into 3rd, any keeping the rpms in the mid to higher 
range, to keep the
 motor's power band spooled up.  He's not interested in stop light 
hot-rodding, nor setting the
 land speed record for a VW bus.  Just a little different gearing to make use 
of the power he
 already has.
