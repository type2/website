I got one of those &quot;NON HIPPY BUS&quot; stickers on the 61 at vintage meet.  Left 
the show, and stopped at the store on the way home, where the checker looked 
at us funny, as we wore our staff tie dyed t shirts and sunglasses.  I prefer 
to keep the number of stickers down though- there is just a couple NEATO ones 
- isn't it nice how you can get a sticker colour coordinated with your red 
green or blue bus?! (plug plug)- stickers on the back, and this one.  The 
&quot;I'm Pro Lifejacket- and I Boat&quot;   sticker is on the Bugster, but the bus may 
soon be used to carry the sailboat to the water for afternoon sailing 
excursions.   (OBC)
