Anyone who sells or installs SACH's clutch kits for vanagons (129-141-???) I
forget the part number..  will have a stash of cheapo but perfectly
serviceable clutch alignment tools . They come one to a clutch kit, and if a
shop does more than one a month, they prolly have a drawer full. I know at
Bug Werks, the shop I recently retired from, we gave em out like haloween
candy to whoever needed....They work in all rear- and mid-engined vw's and
Porsches. Not sure why the Vanagon clutch kit comes with these and the
aircooled kits dont.



oo. it you REALLY feel the need.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; A long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, 'they' (VW dealers, FLAPS)
&gt; used to sell a hard-rubber imitation 'end-of-tranny-shaft' specifically
&gt; for alignment of the disk when installing the pressure plate. I have had
&gt; one for 25 years.  Guess times have changed.  Mine stays in the tool box,
&gt; wrapped in cellophane til needed.
