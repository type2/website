&lt;&lt; Presumably there's some factory-recommended procedure for disconnecting it 
that doesn't require you to pour gas all over yourself and the surrounding 
neighborhood, but I've never figured it out for a stock line &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
It is really simple!  When you replace the flex fuel line just to the front 
of the engine next time make sure to make the new flex line about 5-6&quot; longer 
than needed for this area.  Then when you remove next time you back the 
engine enough to clear the tranny input shaft and lower a couple of inches.  
Reach over the left side of the forward engine sheet metal and twist/pull the 
flex line off the metal line from the engine and plug the flex line with a 
golf tee, a pencil, or the VW shop fuel line clamp (Shaped much like a giant 
safety pin.) to seal off the fuel from the tank.  
    For the 1961ish and earlier VWs they have a reserve shut off valve that 
has not only a reserve function when the cable is pulled all the way out, 
halfway out shuts off the fuel flow and all you have as usable fuel is the 
gas in the carb resevoir bowl.  Both this switch and cable can easily be 
installed on later buses up to 1967.  
    Many of the early VWs with stock reserve switches/cables by now are very 
hard to operate and this is diagonsed as a stiff reserve switch.  Which is 
more often than not is incorrect.  Actually the reserve cable has corroded 
and the lubricant in it has turned into dust.  To fix the cable you either 
just need to replace the entire cable with a new one from WW or clean the old 
one up.  We did this latter method on our 1960 panel camper conversion.  
Remove one of the clamps off of the battery since you will be working in a 
tight place near the starter terminals!  Then unclamp the rear end of the 
reserve cable from the reserve switch and straighten the end of the cable.  
Then go up front and pull out the cable/wire out of it's outer sheathing by 
it's knob.  Using a 100-200 grit sand paper polish the length of the 
cable/wire and reinstall while completely coating the wire with grease as you 
go.  Reconnect the cable to the reserve switch and make very sure the end of 
the cable/wire does not get even close to the starter terminals!  VW seems to 
have just bent/curved the excess about two inches of the cable/wire in a 
U-turn once through the cable clamp to not allow it from contacting the 
terminal of the starter!  Also make sure the reserve switch is in it's fully 
reverse position (Normal.) and when the cable is hooked up that the reserve 
knob is about 1/4&quot; from all the way shoved in to allow you some extra push 
room to operate the switch completely.   Lastly reconnect the battery cable 
and your ready to drive!
  Doing this turned our reserve switch from a two handed struggle on the side 
of the road for Barb to one handed ease of switching while driving at highway 
speed!  Eric&amp;Barb
