&lt;&lt; Hey Again,
 #4 was 120. Also the pitting is on both the head and the top of the cylinder

Hi Peter,
Since it is of a good pressure it sounds like the rings are fine.  Take a 
quick look at the cylinder wall with the piston turned so it is in as far as 
possible.  Look for any large grooves cut into the cylinder wall from a 
broken ring.   Probably something got into the intake system and got bounced 
around in #4 and as long as the pitting/dings are small they should be of 
little concern.     Eric&amp;Barb
