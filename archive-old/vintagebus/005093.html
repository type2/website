Hello,

Today I drove a 70 mile round trip in my '55 SC. When I got home, I decided
to feel the hubs and make sure they were all cool. Checked the drivers front
and worked my way around. Ouch! got to the last one, passenger front, and
the hub cap was very hot! Of course, this is the only bearing I packed while
adjusting the brakes two days ago... I feel stupid.  When I got to this
wheel to adjust the shoes, I could never get them to tighten using the Muir
method. I decided to remove the drum have a look see. This particular wheel
adjusted the opposite from Muir manual instructions. While I had the hub
off, I decided to go in and really pack some grease. I used Slick 50 grease
one and packed the hub, re-installed. The only thing I can think I might
have done wrong is tighten the hub too much. Muir book says to just tighten
until the washer can barely be turned... I think I tightened way more than
this. Would over torqueing the nut cause this hot hub?

Thanks,

Tom
