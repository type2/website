Hi Steve,
Does sound like a bad grounding situation.  Which works by back feeding 
through the running light wire when that system is off, but shuts down that 
tail light when both the running light and brake light are on at the same 
time.  We solder ground wires to each of our bus tail lights to connect them 
to each other and then run a wire from the right tail light to where the 
battery ground strap mounts to the body.  This unfortunitly is a must for 
daily drivers.  VW in the early 1970s finally came to the same conclusion, 
and created a grounding system simular to this for the late buses.   Eric&amp;Barb
