E &amp; B,
I haven't had that experience yet, and believe me, I have dynamited my
brakes often enough with all these crazy drivers. I have read several
posts to this effect, but has it actually happened to someone, or is it
just supposition?

Hi Pja,
Definitely install a 1972-79 bus MC and you absolutely have to install a

pressure regulator for the rear brakes or they will lock up way before
the fronts
and you will end up doing sudden 180 spins when panic punching the
brakes!!
The vaccum servo is a good idea and is an easy hosing job.  The mounting
of the
vaccum servo will be harder.
