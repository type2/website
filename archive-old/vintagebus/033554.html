Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Valve vs. Fuel Tank Feed Pipe Kit
To: labmission_at_juno_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

yes you can use the pipe, then of course the reserve tap doesn't work.

Then again.  WW sells rebuild kits for fuel taps for circa $10.  Worth 
checking out.  I recently got one, then removed and dissasembled my fuel tap 
from my 61.  very nice parts, even if the directions do NOT show a bus fuel 
tap.  The bits ion there do get crudded up and old after 40 ish years for 
some wierd reason.

You may want to replace the fuel sock as well.

 My '61kombi leaks gas.
 I went to the web for prices of fuel petcocks
 the following were cut and pasted from a website
 
 1956-61 Fuel Valve for  $60.00 
 1962-79 Fuel Tank Feed Pipe Kit $5.00   
 
 Can I substitute the latter for the former?
 For $55.00 I can use a stick through the gas filler tube like always
 my valve was stuck any ways, it's just now it leaks.
 Until I get that hotshot biotech job, I'm on a budget.
