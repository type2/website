Subject: &quot;MOTEST&quot; Gas Gauge on 57 deluxe, &quot;RARE?&quot;
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

After inspecting the accessory gas gauge in the 57 hard top deluxe I came up 
with this:

The gauge is approximately the same dimensions as the later &quot;standard&quot; 
gauges, with a black housing and chrome ring.  The housing has printed in 
white &quot;MADE IN WESTERN GERMANY&quot; and on the other side some illegible #s 
ending with '52e and beneath the manufacturer &quot;MOTEST&quot;

The face is really a beauty showing no real signs of aging.  It has the 
MOTEST and GERMANY on it as well as Res, 1/4, a small red light at half tank, 
3/4, and Full.  All lettering is white on a dark gray face with small light 
gray rings (like on the VDO speedos.)

Oh and I got lucky, the sucker actually still werks!! yay!

Anyone have ANY information on this gauge?  Sorry for not having pics up 
right now but I have like 12 rolls of film on the bus but not enough cash to 
get it developed =(
