Subject: RE: [VB] Re: High Beam relay for 67'?

Matt,
speaking of relays, about a year ago I built your 9-pin signal replacement
and it worked great, (remember, I sent pics). During the winter I suffered
from what most do, leaky windshield seals, and collected water in the relays
and shut the system down. I pried apart the relay cans, drained the now
rusty rain water, cleaned the contacts and sprayed everything down with TV
contact silicone spray. Everything worked fine until my control broke. Now
that we are coming into another rainy season, what do you think about
applying silicone seal to the cans, will the seal siphon into the cans
during the dry period or do you think it will be OK ?

Need another 67 switch assembly too ! The last thing that operated was the
hi/lo beam relay before that went also. That was what jogged my memory when
I saw your e-mail.

&gt;Last night I was going over the 67' for dreaded NJ Parsons Inspection
&gt;and the High Beam relay was kaput!  I believe I had vw part #111 941 583
&gt;with terminals 30 and 56 jumpered.

Some headlight relays need this jumper and some don't.  The ones that don't
only have 4 terminals - power in, high beam, low beam, and wire to switch.

Around the first of this year I talked to a guy in Delaware who was fixing
up a Checker cab (!) that someone had put a VW headlight relay in.  He had
a broken 111 941 583 A, and the VW dealer (!!) sold him a 411 941 583 L
which worked in his application.  The 411 part had 5 terminals so he had to
jumper it, like yours is now.  I don't know about the mechanical fit of that
relay; you may have to make up a small bracket or something to mount it in
the stock location but electrically it should work fine.

I don't know what that guy paid for the relay from VW.  Bus Depot, Wolfsburg

West, and Rocky Mountain have the headlight relay in their catalogs from
$19 to $25.  You can't use a plain relay from the FLAPS; this is a latching
relay and the FLAPS ones aren't.
