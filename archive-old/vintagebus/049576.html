Subject: Re: [VB] WTB - Type 3 Cool Tin

&gt;I seem to remember someone posting some month back that they had gauge
&gt;readings w and w/o the cool tin and it didnt make much difference.
&gt;If I was to get a lot more motivated maybe I would search the archive..
&gt;prolly not.

I believe the main use of kool tin is for folks with Jtubes, and not heater
boxes... if you run Jtubes and DO NOT have kool tin, you will have higher
temps. The heater boxes (and the tin betwixt they and the motor) act as a
'dam' to the airflow, forcing it to flow down into this 'chamber' beneath
the heads, and to the rear, as opposed to out the sides as fast as it can
scurry. Kooltin acts to make this 'chamber' right against the heads - you
can also get rid of the two side tin pieces (ones between the motor and
boxes), but most people leave those on anyways.
I have had motors WITH kooltin and the side pieces, and without kooltin but
with the side pieces. never noticed much diff. But running jtubes w/ no
jtubes gave me 10-20 degrees hotter on an average day.....

.02 cents.
