&gt; &lt;&lt; It's a bus you really can't use in the midwest .  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
&gt;   what does that mean?

 Well,
       If you want to preserve the &quot;ORIGINALITY&quot; of the bus, then using it
here in the rust belt would certainly
blow your $20,000 investment rather fast. If I am remembering the bus
correctly from the Classic, then
the paint was faded and bare in spots.That type of paint will NOT hold up
for long in this climate.
If I was spending 20g's on a bus to USE in my neck of the woods then I would
make damn sure there was paint
to protect the metal.A faded paint job won't cut it and is hard to touch up.
    Also it is a original low mileage bus.You don't want to add miles to it
and you don't want to repaint it.You're
kind of stuck leaving it in original condition to try to maintain the high
price tag..A drive on nice Sundays kind of bus.
again,only my opinion.
