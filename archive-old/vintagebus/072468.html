Subject: Re: [VB] oil temps

240-260 and scares me to the point of pulling over for a cool down.
I will soon add an oil cooler/wfan. Are these temps TOO high? Should I be
SKEERED!!
What temps are your buses running?
---------------------- Clip ---------------------
You got about the same thing I got.
I got 1.5 add on capacity oil pan, remote 1 quart FL1 Ford Oil Filter,
10x10&quot; Oil cooler.
I've never seen over 100 (celcius) or 210 degrees (f) no matter how hard
I've run it.
It holds right at 6 quarts of oil.
I think (and correct me if I'm wrong) that 200 to 230 is about ideal
temps.
