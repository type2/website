Subject: [VB] Bad apple warning...long
Message-ID: &lt;002d01bf4357$1019b840$03000004_at_1m55i&gt;

Listees,

    I believe we all know the expression &quot;that one bad apple can spoil the
whole bunch.&quot; Unfortunately, I've found one within the Air Cooled Volkswagen
community. The bad apple's name is John Shepard from Vienna, West Virginia,
with an e-mail address of 1967bugman_at_prodigy_dot_net . I'm only writing this as
a warning to others within the ACVW community.
    Allow me to explain: In response to Shepard's request for parts with
&quot;Claude's Buggies&quot; on them I responded with a detailed description of a set
of Weber one-barrel carburetors with cast aluminum manifolds and a cast
aluminum linkage pivot that I had. The manifolds had &quot;Claude's Buggies&quot; cast
into them. Shepard wrote that he was interested and how much I wanted for
the parts. I wrote that he could have them for $40.00 plus shipping to which
he agreed and gave me his address. To expedite things, (buyer sending seller
a check, seller waiting for check to clear, seller getting shipping
estimate, sending shipping estimate to buyer, buyer agreeing to shipping
estimate, etc.) I told him I would ship the parts and he could reimburse me
for the parts and the shipping, to which he agreed. On November 11, I sent
the parts to Shepard via UPS and the shipping charges were $25.82. As of
December 10, I've yet to receive reimbursement, or anything else, from
Shepard.
    Now I know some or all of you are thinking:  Why would he pay for the
shipping and send the parts to a complete stranger? First, I don't really
consider people within the ACVW community as &quot;strangers.&quot; I believe we're
all, in one way or another, working toward a common goal of enjoying our
ACVW's. I've done this &quot;I'll pay for the shipping and you can reimburse me
for everything&quot; on several occasions. I've sent parts this way to Gilbert Sy
Chan in Manila; David Patrick in Bakersfield, CA; Josh Armstrong in Pine
Bluff, AR; Ryan Holmboe in San Jose, CA; Loren Staley in Reno,NV; Matthew
Steen in Austin, TX;  and Alan Drayson in England. I've trusted all these
people to honor their word and reimburse me and they have repaid my trust in
them by doing so, except for John Shepard.
    Some parts I've actually given away to help others or have charged a
nominal price for the parts. The $65.82 that Shepard has &quot;stiffed&quot; me for
won't kill me although I am retired and living on a small pension. What has
been killed is my being able to trust others to do what they agree to, and
to honor their word. From now on, due to John Shepard, any part(s) I sell or
give away and ship will need to be paid for in advance.

Thanks for reading,
Larry in Scottsdale, AZ
