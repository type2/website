Hi Volks,
Here is a secret that the welding supply shops often do not tell you due to 
them thinking you know what you are talking about what you want/need!  The 
cost between the 2' and 4' long tanks are not hugely differant, but the 
filling cost is the same!  So unless you really need a small portable tank, 
get the bigger one.  To help carry this bigger tank around from job to job 
get a used golf bag cart from your local swap or second hand store.  We got 
our's for $8.00 and it has nice wide moon type wheels to allow towing it 
through our soggy PNW lawns.  Plus when moving the tank in one of our VWs 
this cart folds up into a very compact package.    Eric&amp;Barb
