&gt; I remember Bob Hoover Telling us all about the early Jeep wipers fitting
&gt;perfectly. Do a bit of measuring first as I dont remember details like if
&gt;the arm needed to be Jeep as well or not.


Yeah - matter of fact, I have a jeep blade that a guy gave me and it looks
just like the old bus style blade.  I need the wiper ARMS though therefore
currently I have nothing to hook the wiper blades to!  Besides, this ANCO
wiper arm that I have does not use the SWF blades - it uses a shorter but
more common standard cartridge blade.  Anyone ever see one of these?  Must
be aftermarket.
