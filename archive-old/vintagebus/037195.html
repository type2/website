I am sorry if my relating a personal experience and observation along with a 
question wasn't scientific enough to not piss you off.  As for whether or not 
getting better mileage from any vehicle, bus or otherwise, is a waste if 
time, energy, and money, that's a matter of opinion.  You have made your 
opinion ridiculously clear.
