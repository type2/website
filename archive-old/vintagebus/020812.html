Subject: sightings in Marina del Rey, CA

Man, am I lucky to live in Southern California.
I went to lunch today in Marina Del Rey and there was
a 65 or 66 white/green camper (a Riviera? Large
one-piece crank-out windows) parked in the lot. Very
straight and nice, even had splash pans on the rear
bumper.

Then, I was waiting for my buddy to come out of the
record store, and I noticed the unmistakeable roof of
a 21 window bus peeking at me across the lot above all
the roofs of the &quot;regular cars&quot;.

Closer inspection revealled a very clean 67 sea
blue/white walk-through deluxe with what looked like
an all original clean interior, right down to the
sapphire V radio. The outside was too nice to be
original, but OEM colors. Black plates too.

Either of those on the list?

I was realy bummed I wasn't driving DARTHVW, it would
have been three splitties in one lot!

feelin' good busma...
