&lt;&lt; I live in Pa, and am thinking of getting a swamp cooler for in the summer 
for looks and practicality.  How do they work? and do they work well?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Matt,
Simply put they convert hot air into cooler air by evaporation.  Kind of like 
when you spray cologne or perfume on your skin.  The evaporation of the 
alcohol cools your skin suddenly.  Unfortunitly since water is used as an 
evaporation mechanism the swamp cooler does not work well in humid climates 
where the water has more problems with evaporating.   Eric&amp;Barb
