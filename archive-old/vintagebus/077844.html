Subject: Re: [VB] &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

those bolts do come loose sometimes.  And yes I have drive w/ one broken (but one of the 3, not the far one) knowingly and on purpose, but not loose, or far.  but 2?  no.  When dude came over this summer and he had two broken bolts the thing was the box was thunking back and forth on the spring plate, and you could see the scuff marks. And maybe he could have driven 50 miles back to the shop that put the tranny in, but I really would have felt awful if the rgbox came off the plate on the freeway causing some sort of messed up accident, now, wouldn't I. 

 even with the radio loud he would notice that.   

one of the important things is teling the differenece between okay noises (such as the table in the back squeaking, or the door windows rattling, or the gravel stuck in the deep treaded tires), and the bad fix me NOW stop the bus, call tow truck noises (rod knock, RGB thunk, etc) and the fix me soon but don't freak out (muffler brap, etc) noises.  

guess that guy can't do it.

&gt; What annoyed me the most was actually 2 things combined.
&gt; 1)  He said &quot;I have driven them forever with the bolts missing or broken.&quot;
&gt; 2)  His answer was to up the RPMs before shifting so I 
&gt; didn't hear the
&gt; thunk.
