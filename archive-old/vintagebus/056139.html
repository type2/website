Subject: Re: Westy windows made in USA

Yes they were. A friend here in LHC worked for them for years in So. Cal. He
was working there in 1966 and shipping them to Germany when his grandsons
1966 Westy was built, so he is sure he built his grandsons windows. There is
a date code on every window frame, this is how he verified built date. He
has contacted some friends who worked there about getting some og Hehr glass
to restore the windows with, don't know what he found out, will check with
him today if I have time.
