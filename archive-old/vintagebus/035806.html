Hi,

 I have a 65 DC in need of the 2 pop out windows. I cant seen to find

any here in the north east that dont look as bad or worse thwn the ones I

have. The glass in them is fine, although Im not sure how to remove it and I

have the latches. Any help from a list member with these little buggers?

Thanks,

TJ

the pop outs frames are notorious for rusting out.

 find some good unrusted ones.  yes- not easy in the NE

to remove the frames from the bus, you need to peel back the seal at the 
hinge side of the frame.  there are little slotted screws there.  use 
penetrating oil, the correct size screwdriver.  do not try to unscrew the 
screws.   scrape the slot clean and insert the screwdrver and tap it a few 
times with a hammer to shock the rust loose.   Repeat theis process every day 
for a week, then try to unscrew the screws.  If the slot gets all funky, you 
have to drill them out.  which makes the frames hard to reuse.   after all 
the screws are out and the latche is unscrewed from the frame, remove the 
window.   

to get the glass out, look for the seam in the frame- it is two part.  remobe 
the scraper at those areas, and undo the two screws at each seam area.  pull 
frame apart.  remove glass

look in you bentley book- it will show how this works.

assemble nice frame with new seals and install.  with new screws.
