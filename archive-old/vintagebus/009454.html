Subject: Easy Z-Bed question

This is hopefully an easy question, but I could not find an answer in the archives.

Does an early bay Z-bed fit into a split?  I think the interior code should be SO-44, the most common one, with the clothes cabinet next to the Z-bed with the yellow vinyl covers.  If I understand correctly the SO-44 ran from 65 to at least 72.

Basically I need a z-bed bad and cannot find a splitty specific one to plop in.  Man I hope the bay Z-bed will fit!  Otherwise I will learn how to make one from scratch, yuck.

PS.  I have no idea who this Mirvis character is, but everyone has an opinion.  If I did not do business with people because I did not agree with them I would not be able to shop very many places.  Frankly everyone has gotten so PC that I cannot tell what people really feel these days, kind of like a big social lie.  Granted this is a board about busses, so if Mirvis was not sticking to that (like me right now - doh) it is cool to boot him.
