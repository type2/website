Well Andre - my driving force for using POR15 is that it really does prevent
rust like the company claims it does.  This product is really superior to
all.  With the numbers of our VWs slowly declining, we need to do all we can
to prevent from rusting away.  Since I hate doing bodywork (it's still
really hard for me), I want to do all I can to prevent from having to do any
more than I have to.
The reason for the painting the brake drums is that I hate the look of a
rusty drum - it looks tacky and unfinished.  I hate painting them with
regular paint because it doesn't withstand the road abrasion worth a hoot
and I DESPISE having to go back and do something repeatedly - especially
when I could have done it right the first time.  I would powdercoat if I had
the money but it would require sandblasting the drum and I don't trust the
local high power sandblaster guy to keep his nozzle off my braking contact
area.  I would probably have to get the drums blasted, powdercoated, and
then turned in that order - more time and money.  So I had the drums turned
today, I wire wheeled them clean, and now I can POR15 and have an nice tough
powdercoat like finish that will last a long time.  It should stay shiny for
a long time because because of being in a no-sun area...underneath the bus.
I'm just considering this &quot;doing it right the first time.&quot;

Plus, if you have never used POR15 - you'll never know how addictive this
stuff is.  The thought of preservation and that shiny black finish just
makes you want to do a whole bus in it.  Well, maybe not that far but the
thought has crossed my mind. I think a POR15 bus with a jet black paint job
top and bottom would look awesome - not to mention it would last forever...
