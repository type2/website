Gotta question...I just bought some brake drums and backing plates from
somone and he didn't want to take them apart so he also gave me axle tubes
and the split case transmission...along with the two reduction boxes....My
question...How do I get the reduction boxes of of the axle tube of the early
split case models?
	Something else I am glad to announce,  I have the only splittie VW
bus in Texarkana! Kinda neat there....Anything anyone can tell me about the
r.b. will be helpful thanks
