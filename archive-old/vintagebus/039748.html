Greetings everyone!

As you may have read from Ronnie, Lake Havasu has lost another bus. 
Fortunately, that means that I have acquired a '60 DD Panel in fabulous 
condition. Now begins my quest for the various bits of unobtanium that are 
missing to make it an enjoyable vehicle for me. It has been many years (yes 
Katie, 10) since I've owned a Type2 and I am happy to be back in that 
capacity.

Anyway, I hope to meet many of you at different events and gatherings in the 
months and years to come. Please be patient with my lack of knowledge as I 
struggle to gain competence in this new endeavor.

Thanks, ~Rich Barker
