Subject: RE: [VB] Intro to List

Hi Robert,

Welcome to the list... well, it's been a fairly strange and goofy list
of recent... hope you don't hold that against us.

To figure out which bus You need or would be happy with, start by asking
your self what purpose you intend for it and then I'm sure VW or some
coach builder once made something to fit the bill.  Hell, I just saw
pictures earlier this morning of a VW milktruck conversion!  And hey, if
you can't decide, do as many of us have already done and buy a bunch of
'em...



We wont hold the d*tsun fetish against you too much ... or at least I
wont as I've always liked the old 240 and 260Zs.  Just don't ask us
where to put the water in your new splitty :-)


David




Robert submitted a post:
Hello, this is Robert.  I'm new to the list, and thought I should
introduce
myself.

I don't own a Bus yet.  I joined this list to determine which style bus
I
want.  I'm
not up to speed on all of the acronyms yet, but know it'll be a
&quot;splitty&quot;.

I live in Albuquerque, NM, USA, where old vehicles seem to last forever.
I
like
working on cars, although I don't consider myself a mechanic.  Hope I
don't
get
hammered for this, but I'm kinda a Datsun freak.  I have two 67
Roadsters, 
a 74 260Z, and my daily driver is an 83 280ZX.

I'm enjoying the Hippie &amp; SO threads.  I'm 45 and I've been with my SO
for
22 years.
She likes cars, but was somewhat hesitant about buying a Bus, til I took
her
to some
of the links I've seen on this list.

Nuff said, later...Robert (Bus-less for now)
