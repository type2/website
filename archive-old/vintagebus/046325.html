material to match the original.it has a green interior with light green with
dark green graph insert . the insert material is mainly what i need also could
use some nice door glass any help would be appreciated thanks jim in san diego

Hi list
The como green interior is being reproduced. The interior was used on the
62-64 deluxe busses painted turquoise and blue-white.
The repro int. is an identical match. For those interested I can provide a
number for the person reporducing them.
Anyone interested can p-mail me for info.

Thanks
