&lt;&lt; My question:  What is the difference between pre-1964 washer bottles and
other washer bottles?&gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
Well it looks the same from ten feet out, but has differences.  The 1964-67
bottle has a black straight surfaced knurled collar that screws to the white
opaque hard plastic bottle.  The pre-1964 bottle has a collar that is black
and triangular in cross section, has scallops cut into it for hand gripping
instead of the knurling, and instead of a long thread to screw on it goes on
like a pharmacy bottle and only turns 1/3 of a turn to open/close.  The
plastic bottle is more translucent, instead of hard white plastic, and is
very flexible, and has a strong smell when near your nose that reminds us of
old collaspable water bottles for camping.

&lt;&lt; I have a 63 deluxe with the nozzles and hoses but no washer bottle and
didn't realize that there were different ones.  How do I tell which one I
need?  &gt;&gt;
Well both bottles mount the same way and look, and work simular though you
could not use parts from a early bottle to fix a later bottle or vise versa.
Either botlle will fit into and work in late or early.  So it is one of
things that you have to decide if it makes a difference to you and decide if
you want to use an early bottle if you can find one, or use a late bottle
till you find a early one.
 The same thing is true of the early and late windshield nozzles the early
ones are chromed plated machined brass that look like a machine gun turret
and the late model ones are a grey plastic with a BB with a hole through it's
center.  Which makes it look like minature beady eyed cyclops at each window.
