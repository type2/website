Subject: Re: [VB] another good day for the bus!

I live in a subdivision and don't get any nasty letters or complaints
when I pull the motor in my driveway.  Maybe the people in my subdivision
just like me... Andrew

Last engine I pulled out of a 66 bus came out in less than 30 minutes.
The PO had installed a quick electrical disconnect (Aircraft Cannon Plug)
and it was just a piece of cake after dropping the fuel line, and two oil
cooler lines.
Big surprise was that I plugged it back in on the first stab in about the
same speed.
