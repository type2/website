Subject: '64 front wheel bearing questions
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10007182308050.1964-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

I made an inspection tour of the front drums on my '64 Standard
tonight.  I'm not sure about something with the inboard bearing.

Muir (the only manual I have at the moment...Bentley's is on the
way) says that the inner race for the inboard bearing should
stay on the spindle when you pull the drum off.  However, all of
my inner bearing seemed to stay in the hub, held in by the 
seal.  I knocked the seal out from the front side and took
the inboard bearing out of the hub.  The outer race stayed
inside the hub, but the inner race and cage seem to stay
together.  I don't mean they're stuck - the rollers and cage
turned freely - but it looks like they're not meant to come
apart.

Also, there is supposed to be some kind of spacer between the
inboard bearing and the brake plate.  I found a message in the
archives stating that on '64-'67 busses, this spacer is part
of the spindle, not separate like on earlier and later Buses.
I think that's what I've got.  From the brake plate out,
the spindle is large-diameter and grungy for about 1cm axially.
Then it loses about 1cm diameter and is shiny.  The grease seal
would like like a &quot;U&quot; in cross section.  The bottom of the
&quot;U&quot; seems to seat on the brake backing plate, and the side
of the &quot;U&quot; that's not against the drum seats on this integral
spacer (grungy bit).  It didn't appear to be leaking any grease,
but this Bus hasn't been driven for quite a while, either.

For fun, I slid the inboard bearing down on the spindle.  It
seated against the spacer and stopped there - the inner race
was on the shiny part.  I could slide it all the way down to
the spacer with my fingers - didn't have to use any force.  
The bearing OD was greater than the spacer OD, and I don't see
how the seal would seat on the spacer - another reason I think
it seats on the backing plate.  When I spun the cage and rollers
with my fingers, they rotated...but the inner race also rotated
on the shaft.  It fit closely...it wasn't rattling around on the
shaft, but it wasn't immobile either.

A couple of quick notes: on the driver's side, at least, the
cylinders have been replaced...they both had &quot;VARGA, IND. BRAS.&quot;
cast into them (unless Brazilian cylinders were stock on a '64).
The flex line is serviceable, but will get replaced anyway on
general principle -- at least it didn't have that &quot;chock all
four wheels on both sides and hide the spark plugs in the attic
so you can't drive it&quot; look.  :)  Also, the upper shock absorber
bolt seemed loose...by grabbing the shock, I could get the rubber
bushing to move a bit on the bolt/sleeve (normal) but I could also
rotate the bolt/nut relative to the front beam horn with my fingers
(bad?)  The bolt and nut seem to be reasonably tight on one another
(probably rusted) but they are not tight to the horn.

I finally put it all back together properly (put the inboard
bearing in the hub with the grease seal to hold it in.)  I couldn't
get the grease seal below the hub surface...it was sticking up
about 0.25-0.50 mm.  But it seemed to be seated in well.  I
adjusted the end-play (two nuts and lock-plate; a late-model
allen-clamp nut is on the shopping list) and all seemed to
be well.  I had about 1.5cm of threaded spindle sticking
out past the outboard nut when all was done.

My questions are...

1.  Is it normal for the inner race to stay with the inboard
    bearing?

2.  Should there be a separate spacer on the spindle, or have
    I described the &quot;integral&quot; spacer?  Is one lip of the
    grease seal supposed to seat on this spacer?

3.  Should the inboard bearing inner race turn freely on the
    spindle?  I know the cage/rollers should turn on the race -
    that's their purpose in life - but I'm not sure the
    race should turn.

3.  Is it a safe assumption that the Brazilian wheel cylinders
    aren't original?

4.  Should that upper shock absorber bolt and nut be tight to
    the frame horn?

5.  Should I be able to drive the grease seal flush with the
    hub or even further in, or is it supposed to stick up a bit?

Thanks in advance for the help!  I appreciate it!!
