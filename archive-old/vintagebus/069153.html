Subject: LT 215/75/R14  ???

Simple question really, but is there any LT 215/74 R14 tires being made 
these days?

I tried to find some for a buddies '71 and came up with nothing.

Rumor has it that Michelin has/d a 205/75 R14 but I could not find that 
either.

The only way to get decent tires these days is to go 15s! I did.


Thanks,
Adrian
