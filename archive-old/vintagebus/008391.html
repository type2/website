Hi all
I have to say,, I really love the valuable resource this list is! and the VW
people that make it!
Thanks all for your help... whether it was a few words of wisdom
Or the use of your Garage,, Thanks AIRS  Dave Russell of Colorado
or finding the VW parts I need,,, thanks most recently to Steve Howell
or for the inspiration to go or do something VW again ,, thanks everyone!
Thanks to all the members of the fledgling Club I joined this year,,, The
Bug Pack.. for an unbelievable amount of homebrewed fun!
Thanks for all those VW specific Christmas cards!

Thanks to the Folks who keep the list level headed and kind!

Starting to sound like I got an award and need to thank Mom and Dad tooo...
But thanks everyone!

I had a great Day today,, I got the VW ebay purchases in my postal box, I
got the VW part from Steve from Washington!  I even recieved a gift at
work,, a box of chocolates via a name draw for those who have no vacation
left , so they have to be at  work,, poor me! Hahaa  I used all my Vacation
to go,,,, well I can't list all the shows,, But Everybus, and Buses by the
Balloons was my favorite!
The hurricane in manassas was strangly fun,,, driving 500 miles to a
postponed event?? huh FUN,, ??
