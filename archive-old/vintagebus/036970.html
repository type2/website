Hi Mat,
&gt;From what we have read you really need to use 250-300 grit sandpaper.
Anything higher will be too smooth and not allow the new coat of paint to
adhere.  Resulting in paint that not only chips, but flakes off.  Hopefully
there is a painter out there that can tell for sure.    Eric &amp; Barb
