Hello all,
	Im new to the list and I come in search of parts. Im looking for a
driver side door, gates, complete front floor, and a rear seat pedestal. I
know the gates and the ped are rare but what better place to ask for them
than here! I have had some price quotes and they seen rather high. Like 150
for a used door, 150 for the floor, etc.  Where would be the best place to
get these items? I have all sorts of misc type 1 parts(mostly Ghia) that I
can trade or I'll pay for them. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I
would like to get this beast back on the road ASAP!
