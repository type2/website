Hi all
After removing the engine on the 67 to fix a broken exhaust stud, I decided to move the battery to the left side of the compartment, where it could rest on metal, instead of the plywood it was on.  I removed the battery cable from my parts westy, and used that and another nice chunk of wire to the regulator.  
Two qustions:
The added length of wire to the regulator shouldn't be a problem.  Am I right?
Someone ran a wire from the mounting tab of the regulator to the negative battery terminal.  Is this stock, or added insurance against lousy grounds?

Thanks!!!!
