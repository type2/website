Keep them, even if you do not actualy use the thermostat.  The vanes
direct the airflow to certian areas of the engine....see the archives
(vw.i405_dot_com) for more.

This is .correct.   If you look closer you will see a nut that holds the
&quot;angled&quot; piece on, then under that pieces is a screw or bolt that holds
the last part on.  they are .required. parts!!!  They direct the now-hot
air that is blown across the cooler outside of the engine compartment.
Without them you just suck the now-hot air back into the fan and.....

&gt; the front tin.  This appears different from other shrouds that have one
&gt; side of the cooler exposed on the backside of the shroud.

This is .wrong. .wrong. wrong.  See above.

&gt; My question...  will the 74 parts work?

Yes.  Do note that you will need to blockoff the port on the (passenger?)
side of the shroud, near the top.  this nipple normally blows air into the

charcoal cannister...

also...if your front tin does not have the hole for that part of the fan
shroud that exits there, go back and get that piece.  it wont go together
w/o that hole.;)

good luck.
