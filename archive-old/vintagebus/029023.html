Hey Kirin,
This was discussed, and possibly beaten to death already not too long ago.
Consensus seems to be that no, you don't need to run leaded fuel.  I've never
put a lead additive or anything of the sort into any of my VW's and haven't had
a problem.  Search the archives...there should be plenty of material in there.

&gt; leaded fuel. Now wouldn't you need to add the same additive if your dub ran
&gt; on leaded fuel? Thanks For the input
