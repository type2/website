&gt; Cal, interesting you mention the diodes... if you use the 431.951.253.G
&gt; 12v 40a relay,,, it has a diode in the coil ciruit from the mfgr ...
&gt; actual practice,, sounds good in theory though.

Jamie, the diode in the coil circuit is prolly in parallel with the coil
for transient suppression purposes. My rec was for putting one or two
diodes in series with the coil. Each diode will drop about 0.7 volts, thus
raising the threshold at which the relay would activate. IE, if the the
relay required 8 volts to pull in, then two diodes would raise that to
about 9.4 volts. You could keep adding diodes or use a zener diode with
appropriate voltage rating in series, to set the threshold where you
wanted it.

&gt; The dc resistance on this relay coil is about 1.85M ohms

Are you sure you don't mean 1.85K ohms, not M ohms? I've never heard of a
1 Megohm coil in a relay in my life.
