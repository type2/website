Subject: Junk vehicle rampage across the nation.

People - I am shocked!  I've been trying to do some research on the net for
any court cases that set a precedence concerning a person's right to have a
&quot;junk vehicle.&quot;  I did a search on Northern Light and am literally shocked
at the multitude of locations around the nation where people complain about
junk vehicles and the city comes in a removes them.  It's a plague!  Laws
are being passed in droves against owners of old cars.  It isn't enough that
you pay taxes on it when it's new and pay taxes on it its whole life...NO!
They have to fine you and tow it on top of it.  I read of case after case
where junkyard owners are FORCED into complying with the city on a crushing
campaign with the ultimate demise of the junkyard as the intent.

We live in a wasteful intolerant society.  After reading all these articles
that I found, I feel so helpless.  The auto enthusiasts of the nation are
becoming a target of the wealthy upper class whose lives depend soley on
having pleasant things to look at 24 hours a day and aren't happy until
every last area they can lay their eyes upon is not deemed an eyesore.

They don't realize that guys like us who like to tinker, restore cars,
rebuild engines and so forth center our lives around this stuff.  We enjoy
working on our projects just as much as wealthy who enjoy watering their
grass, planting flowers, playing golf, and sitting on their butts all
weekend long watching TV on their big entertainment center.  Their
lifestyles are being forced upon us.

I can see now that living in the country is life the way it's supposed to be
in the United States - free to enjoy the pursuit happiness without being a
victim of socialism.

BTW:  Does anyone have any websites that talk about a legal precedence where
a person went to court and won his case against one of these bs laws?  This
is the kind of info I'm looking for and having trouble finding.

Thanks!
