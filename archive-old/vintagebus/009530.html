But, but.....

I'll have you know that my factory heater was working just fine, and I don't
have problems (nor would I use a propane powered heater) while driving.

The stock heater functions not when the vehicle is stationary with engine
off....

I am speaking specifically of camping, and every once in a while when

change clothes and ... well, uh...

&gt; enjoy the ride!
