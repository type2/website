I've had so many people at work ask me a question about my &quot;bug&quot; when they
mean bus.  If they ask anything about the &quot;bug&quot; I answer them truthfully
(pretending that I don't know their mistake) and it confuses them to the
point where they soon start asking me correctly  For example:

Them:  Did you get your bug parts down to the sandblaster guy today?
Me:  No - I drove the bug to work, see? (me pointing towards the parking
lot)
Them:  Oh no, I meant your bus.
Me:  Oh yeah, I made it there in good time.

OR

Them:  So how'd your bug project go last night?
Me:  I only have one stall available to me at the shop so there is no way I
could have worked on the bug last night with the bus in the way.
Them:  Oh you know - I meant the bus.
Me:  Oh yeah, things went really well...got a lot done...blah blah blah

I guess you call this 'playing stupid.'

Our slang term in the family has been BeetleBugBus - rolled off the toungue
really fast.
