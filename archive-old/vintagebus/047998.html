&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;And on a side note, is the rear apron on a '58 supposed to have the 
cutout 
 for a tailpipe on the left side. I ask because BFY told me that when I 
bought 
 their muffler, it was the only 36 hp type 2 muffler there is and the pipe 
 comes out the right side.&gt;&gt;
 According to our APR58 VW bus shop manual yes it is the only one for 36HP.  
 If you plan on driving this around much you might want to make your own 
 tailpipe to get the exhaust off to the right side into the airstream to 
 prevent so much carbon monoxide swirling around in a cloud behind your bus.  
 Which can be easily sucked through any of the engine/body, engine lid/body, 
 or rear hatch/body seals and into the interior of the bus.

Uhh, are you serious. Just keep the rear hatch door shut and you wont have a 
problem with exhaust in the bus.
