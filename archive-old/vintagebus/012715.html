Aloha
for those of you friendly and knowledgable list members who remember our
hero blasting out of mississippi with his new top end 16half church
parking lot rebuild and louisiana tuneup on the kombi; here is the latest
instalment in the continuing westward saga.
besides homesickness for his island home our  hero had another reason for
dogging his poor kombi; freezing rain. the weather channel showed a mean
front  dipping down out of the midwest and into texas.
he hit houston still ahead of it and continued to drive through the
night. About 80 mi. out of san antonio the bus began to lose power  as it
was pre dawn out hero clicked off his  headlights and the thing picked up
to cruising speed.
there was a semi truck coming up on his tail ominously fast. he tapped
the breaks to let the big rig know he was slowing  for ice on the bridge
about half way across he uttered words that every flight recorder renders
before the moment of impact  &quot;Oh s*t&quot;
thus our hero blew his christian testimony.
when  he came to it was fully morning the full light  help him see the
blurry outline of the guy with his cell phone. he blurted something
incoherent to the good samaritan.
he had no idea were he was or who he was. as he staggered around the
Kombi visual clues started to remind him what was up.
he installed a full roll or duct tape back and forth from the 1st popout
window to the door handel and front bumper and crawled in from the
passenger side bump started it  in gear and drove with no clutch to the
nearest exit.
80 miles later in san antonio he misted his cutoff exit and the bus died
at a surface street light. as he got out to push it  the lady in the lane
next to him asked if he was alright. there was clotted blood on his head
and he was staggering around shivering violently from the cold.
some mexicans helped him on a failed push start before the sirens wailed
and the EMT unit showed up with the cops in tow.
she had called 911

next episode: our hero has a san antone christmas and buys a new battery,
regulator and receives a talsmen from a local shaman

HEY!
a big mahallo to Neil for the fish carburetor story!
buy way of further gas rumination check out CB performance's modification
 to some dells. Their web site showed a loaf bus doing one pyrotechnic
burnout. YEEhaaah!
It's kind of the same thing as a fish carb with throttle shaft jets and
all.
I wonder if the patient on this fish is run out
a guy could manufacture it and sell it as a Y2K compliant unit on the art
bell show.

&gt;&gt;From the far of shores of florida to the ragging surf of Oahu...
mucho alohas
our zero er ah hero
