Subject: Rear suspension height

Hello All,
I have a question about the height of the rear of my bus.  It is a 67 Westy 
with full interior.  It has all stock suspension except for new shocks in 
the rear. At a recent meet I noticed that my bus was at least 2 inches lower 
in the rear than other similar buses.  What can I do to increase the height 
of the rear of my bus?
Boyd Smith
67 Westy
