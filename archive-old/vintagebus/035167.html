Subject: RE: Steering problems on the 67
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

On my 67 I have the same problem, I have come up with the following 
conclusions.

As far as steering, the steering arm AT the box has worn down thus giving way 
too much play.  You can try all the adjustments you want but make sure you 
dont adjust it too tight or your wheel may stick.  We all know what that 
means.  Repair is not that hard but does require a special tool which can be 
rented from various parts suppliers.  It will make quite a difference and 
from what i have gone through it gets kinda wierd.  I got used to the play 
and then I fixed it and I swerved all over the road even more!!! Just not 
used to the response.  After a day or two I was fine and the bus handled 
great.  I guess now I should fix that crack in the frame rail right next to 
the beam.  Please correct me if any of this is BS.
