Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Troubles...HELP!!!


For what its worth...

We had a similar problem with my 64-bug that drove us nuts for awhile and it 
turned out to be a vacuum leak... a subtle one in the manifold.  Tthese 
symptoms also occurred on our 73 510 with the same conclusion.

&gt;Jon, Have you set up a vacuum gauge? We know how much you like gauges.
&gt;Because like Ronnie we think vacuum LEAK but where?  Intake manifold sounds 
&gt;to
&gt;be the only thing you have not exchanged externally.
&gt;What about a High lift and over lapping cam??
&gt;What did Rachel think about -- (later i held up a white towel to the 
&gt;tailpipe
&gt;for about 10 minutes--came
&gt;away clean)?

&gt; &gt;  engine doesn't want to idle well, especially after decelarating
&gt; &gt; from high rpm's, especially after driving, then it just wants to stall 
&gt;out.
&gt; &gt; idle is rough, alomst sounds like a cylinder isn't firing (they all 
&gt;are),
&gt; &gt; and the engine is visibly shaking (but not super bad, but noticeable to 
&gt;me)
&gt; &gt; at idle. runs good when first starting it and the choke is closed, but 
&gt;when
&gt; &gt; off the choke, it runs like crap.
