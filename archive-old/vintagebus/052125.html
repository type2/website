	ch or 400 for both

  I have gotten the last 5 of my Bay windows for free. The last one was a
1970 Westy, complete except for engine and trans. It was dropped off in the
street in front of the shop with Ronnie's playhouse painted on the side. It
seems out here in Havasu Bays are abundent and are bought cheep or just
given away. The offroad guys buy them, pull the engines and trannys and look
for a place to DUMP them.
  My DD panel I basically got for free also. It came in a package of 6 buses
I bought from a wrecking yard that was getting ready to close and crush
everything! over 600 VW's were there. Sold one of the campers I got for the
total cost of the 6 (cheap) and the rest were free!. When I was there
getting the buses there was a group there from Mexico with a huge truck and
they were getting all they could load in the truck for $500 a load, we're
talking a 30 foot flatbed with 10 foot tall sides. I was starting to grab
stuff out of some piles there, like a pile of 67 and earlier bug steering
wheels with horn rings and they yelled at me to stop. They were on there 3rd
truck load when I went and picked up the last bus.
  The worst part was the owner had allready crushed some of the splits
before I got there and this was only 3 yeras ago!

I have a 70 and 71 bus. Both decent condition but need engines. The 70 is 
from Arizona, but Im located in North Central Florida. This weekend 
only...250 each or 400 for both. Just trying to make a little room. There 
are ads on TheSamba if you would like a picture.
