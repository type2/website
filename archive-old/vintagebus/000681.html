&lt;&lt; here is a 64 Kombi in the area for sale sans the middle and rear seat. I
 have two nice sets  of early bay seats. One set if from the 69 and the other
 from the 72. Will these bolt up to the existing holes (ones made by VW not
 by nature) in the cargo floor? Will the rear seat even fit in it or is the
 splitty slightly narrower than a bay?
  &gt;&gt;
I have fitted an ealy bay rear seat into a 67 kombi.  it is a little funky at 
the side clamps, but easier to do that than it was to find a splitty seat.  
later seat seemed a little narrow
