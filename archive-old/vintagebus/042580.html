hi all,

Well, turns out i was overreacting to my funny noise (as usual.)

I yanked the motor again last night and what did i find?

My new pressure plate was taller than the old one (diaphraghm type) and
was rubbing slightly on the bellhousing.  Boy did that make a racket.

I shall finish my exhaust work and thermostat installation and reinstall
the engine, and then instead of grinding on the bellhousing with a dremel
i shall run teh engine until the noise goes away... not the best plan, but
certainly the easiest, and only the metal that needs be gone will get
ground away.

Then its on to figuring out the funny noise from the transaxle and putting
in my new rear shocks... i've been putting that off for a month.  Once my
splitty is serviceable, i will probably begin tearing into my 71 to get it
back to its once reliable and smooth running status. (since i only have 2
busses for transport, its important i keep them up.)

take care,

Steve
