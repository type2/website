 In a message dated 98-11-04 04:42:39 EST, you write:
 
 &lt;&lt; hold the throttle open a bit wider.  
 &lt;&lt;But the other half of the equation is
 &lt;&lt; air.  Rather than too LITTLE fuel, 
 &lt;&lt;you may be getting to MUCH  Indeed, 
 &lt;&lt;this is the common cause of this 

 &lt; ...I don't understand your use of 'to MUCH' ...

-------------------------------------------

That shows you've got good sense :-)

It's a typo.  Sorry for the confusion.

It should have read ...getting too MUCH air.   Or mebbe ...too much AIR!...  

Or something.  I remember I corrected something in there... or tried to.   In
doing so I somehow managed to erase &quot;air.&quot;

The point I was trying to make is that a lean burn is defined as too little
fuel OR as too much air.   If we focus only on fuel we often overlook the
other side of the equation.

 (Like the joke about the sandwich -- it wasn't that the meat was sliced too
thin but that the bread was too thick :-)
