Have you checked it with 180 pounds in the driver's seat?  That tends to
lower the front a tad.

When you measured the angle of the rear trailing arms, did you lift them
up to take the play out of the splines?  If you didn't, they could be set
a degree or two low.

Is this a late beam transplant?  IIRC, those ride a bit high in the front.
