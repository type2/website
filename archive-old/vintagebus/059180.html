Subject: Re: [VB] Got my birth certs! time to start cutting in the walkthru

&gt;
&gt;everything seems to be in order on my barndoor certificate except that
&gt;it says my panel has Mcode 083 which they say is &quot;walkthrough cab&quot;.. 
&gt;but my bus is not a walkthru.  Looking at their Mcode list, they have
&gt;4 walkthru mcodes, 80,81,82,83.  80 is called out as being specific
&gt;for a panel bus, walkthru.  My only guess is this list isnt early
&gt;model specific and 83 meant something else back in the day?

The definitions that the VW museum comes up with are pretty much the
last word.  However I will note that the M-code list in the Doliwa
book only has 80 and 81 as &quot;divided cab rear wall&quot;.  80 is listed for
models 211, 213, 215 (Panel, cargo doors right/left/both); 231, 233,
(Kombi, cargo doors right/left); 235, 237 (sunroof Kombi, cargo doors
right/left).  81 is listed for 221, 223 (Nine-seater, cargo doors
right/left); 225 (sunroof nine-seater, cargo doors right); 241
(nine-seater special model, &quot;Samba&quot;).  This list is probably at best
equal to the Bulli-Kartei list (as of about 1999) and at worst a
subset of that list; Bulli-Kartei has several credits in this book.

Some of the M-codes do change through time.  Clara W. and I figured
out on the list that M 164 meant &quot;front turn signals&quot; (and possibly
other electrical-system differences) until January 1960; after that
it meant &quot;sliding door&quot;.  There are a few other codes like this.
Of course, all the M-codes change for bays and Vanagons.
