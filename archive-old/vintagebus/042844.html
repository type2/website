  Bus Dreams...It has been 15 years since I went to a bus meet.  I
remember the 2nd and 3rd SOTO meet in the mid 80's at some school in
Orange County, LA.

  I admit, I was drooling over some of the buses I saw in Hot VWs or VW
Trends and it was nice to see showroom restored buses...But those custom
restorations, were way cooler and full of imagination and those were the
persons I wanted to hang with.

 I noticed that some restorer's were just not as friendly as I had hoped
(most of them were lost in the original game.)  The words NOS and OEM were
pretty abused and the marketers would jack the price up to where it was
just not affordable with my pay the Navy was giving me.  When I went away
from the main marketing area I found some great deals in other attendees
parts bins.  There were some real deals near the end where people did not
want to bring back what they could not sell, and at that time I had found
my deals and met some of the friendlier people [who had homebrew!] and I
was relaxed as one could be in South West LA.  The raffle and balloon toss
through the double doors was done and our little camp of 4 split owners
started to talk about restorations and what we were planning to do with
our busses.

  Although, I saw the same idea in Gilbert Shelton's Motoring Tips of
Freak Brothers Fame.  One dude was going to put a supercharged 6.7 liter
Wildebeest-Cosworth V6 which produces 950 Horsepower at 7.5K rpm on
Methanol!  The pilot was going to make a small pool table that dropped
from the pop-top, and install a hybrid electric power assist, joystick
(yoke-like) controlled Mobile Office.  The welder was going to splice a
dormmobile top on top of his camper for more sleeping/storage places.  
And this other dead head was going to get a Eriba Puck trailer and go to
Central America for as long as he could stand it.  I told my plans which
were to get rid of the laminated simulated wood grain and put real wood
throughout the bus and make it like a nice cabin cruiser and redo
everything so my bus would not break down along the way.  We all agreed
that some of the ideas that VW had were good and some of them were not so
good (heat, standing water windows...)  After market fixes were generally
worse than VW's original idea, but it kept people employed and working in
the recessions I guess.

  Since I have not finished restoration of my camper yet, I vicariously
just read the Vintagebus list and have bus dreams till the time I can make
it to another bus meet and meet some interesting split nosers again.  
Thanx’s for the parts Ronnie and tech tips Barb and Eric!  And all the
interaction that goes on with the listee's.

Happy Holidays,
joe
