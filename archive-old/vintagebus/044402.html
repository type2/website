Subject: Westy bus score

I took my buddy to Midland, TX last night to pick up a bus I got 
tipped on. I was told it was a walk-thru westy with no motor, 
bumpers, front windshield glass, or turn signals. Interior was 
supposed to be real nice and the body no rust and only a couple of 
minor dents.

When we got there I was glad to see that pretty much what I was told 
was true. This bus has the nicest original condition nose I think 
I've ever seen in person. Total virgin. It was missing the emblem. 
Body is very straight with one small dent in the beltline and a very 
small crease on one of the sides. absolutely no bondo or rust 
anywhere. Apron is missing. Nice, nice, nice.

Interior is also in good condition. Westy stuff looks good. Some of 
the side wood has been replaced with Lowe's trailerhouse wood 
paneling. Roof is original wood and back corners are origianl wood. 
Missing sink. No whatnot cab. It's a walk-thru bus with the proper 
walk-thru westy interior. Carpet on the floor OVER the original west 
floor material. All floors are solid as a rock. No tears or rips in 
vinyl, except one very tiny one. pop-top works good, but is missing 
the material.

Upon further inspection it turns out the bus is a '63, but has the 
SO-42 interior. I'm not a camper guy, but I thought the SO-42 was a 
'65 thing. And the Westy tag says '66. Did this ever happen where an 
older bus went back and got set-up with the westy stuff....or did 
someone just do a camper transplant. The pop-top looks good...not 
llike a hack. But there is a camper window where one of the closets 
is...kinda making me think it was a transplant.

Regardless the bus is very nice and the camper interior is very 
nice...both the bus and the SO-42 stuff is walk-thru model... and the 
new owner was very happy paying $800 for it. I think he got a steal.
