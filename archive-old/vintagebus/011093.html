Subject: Wanted: Panel van for furniture stores shop truck.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

still looking........We are still on the hunt for a panel to use as a  &quot; 
furniture-mobile&quot;, my  friend is tired of driving his Dodge truck and the 
police have never recovered 
his 63 Double cab that got ripped off late in 98.

As far as the panel , must be pretty solid , a little patch work but nothing 
desperate, non running OK , paint not important .

the closer to Los Angeles the better but could get it trucked from Northern 
Cal , Arizona, Nevada , Utah etc

please let me know what you know that needs a new home

thanks for your help............
