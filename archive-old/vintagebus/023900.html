Subject: RE: Fallen in love, with a model ... seeking Double Cab

&gt;I need your help finding a split Double Cab to purchase.


Check with Gerald Kracher in Redding.  I know that currently he is &quot;off
the net&quot; until he gets a new computer.  

Gerald seems to always to be coming up with double cabs for sale.
His web page lists a '61 for $2500, this may be out of date, but...


His web page: http://members.aol_dot_com/Vwbuslvr/geralds.html
His Email: mailto:vwbuslvr_at_aol_dot_com

You might try checking in with BusBoys in Redding and see if they know
how to reach him.
