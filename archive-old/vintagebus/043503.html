&gt;The main reason that the airplane folks use reduction units is that auto
&gt;engines tend to produce their best power at around 4500-5000RPM while the
&gt;speed of a typical propeller is limited to less than 3000RPM because at
&gt;higher RPMs the tips of the prop go supersonic, creating noise and
&gt;reducing efficiency.

One thing I wonder about using a VW RGB on an airplane -- it's being
loaded rather differently on the plane than in a Bus.  The torque on
the gears is about the same, but I would think that a Bus would load
the RGB shafts a lot more in shear, since each one has to hold up
over a quarter of the weight of the Bus.  It wouldn't load them in
thrust much until you went around a corner.  On the airplane, if
the prop is balanced right, there shouldn't be much shear at all,
but there will be tons of thrust loading - the prop is pulling the
plane, right?  (There could be some other coupling between the RGB
and the prop, like a big honkin' thrust bearing, which would solve
this problem.)

I don't remember which one, but one of the &quot;popular airplane&quot; mags
has a &quot;kit/homebuilt review&quot; spread once a year.  They give little
blurbs of all the different designs for kit and homebuilt planes
that they know about - either a photo or part of the plans, the
basic specs like wingspan, length, capacity, range, etc, and what
kind of engine it takes.  In the one I saw a couple of years ago,
VW and Subaru flat-fours were popular, as were smaller inline
engines like the 3-cylinder from the Geo Metro/Suzuki Swift.

Personally, if I was using VW parts in a plane, I'd be really
picky...it would start with getting the proposed engine case/RGB
housing/etc x-rayed, and go on from there.  &quot;Single point of
failure&quot; and all that.  :)
