Re: production amounts per day.

I own two busses built on subsequent days (24 and 25 of November, 1966) which 
are 286 units apart (22762000 and 2?762286) and a friend and I own two 1959 
Westfalias built on subsequent days (June 29 and 30, 1959)(I won the bet over 
who's bus was older) which are 926 units apart.  Apparently, even in '59 the 
production was in the neighborhood of 500/day!
