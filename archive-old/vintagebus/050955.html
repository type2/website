Subject: RE: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth

Most places don't carry those adapters, and I bet you would be hard pressed
to find another one at another CostCo, I know, I've looked at Firestone, Les
Shwab, GoodYear, Big O, and so on. 

I solved my delema with a Chevy adapter plate. I had it spin balanced, which
meant drilling a little metal out here and there, but when it was done, I
could take it to the shop with my lug nuts and Whah La, a balanced tire.

Subject: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth



Okay... there was a recent thread about the balancing of rims for our 
beloved beasts and how difficult it was to find a shop.  Interestingly, I 
was replacing tires on my H**da last night and mentioned this to one of the 
guys in the shop to see if he might, on the off chance, have any thoughts.  
He looked at me funny for a moment and asked &quot;you mean those older rims with

the big opening?&quot; to which I responded yep... he gazed up at the roof a 
moment, walked across the shop and reach down behind on of the spin 
balancers and held up what I would swear was an adaptor.  Said they got them

in from time to time.  We are talking the spin balancers now and not the old

school bubble balancers.

Now, you may ask, is where was I?  COSTCO of all places.  So, if you are 
near one of these outfits you might want to wander into the tire shop and 
see if they have an adaptor.  The fellow in the Vallejo, CA store said he 
thought all the COSTCO tire shops had them but he wasn't certain.
