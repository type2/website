Subject: german mufflers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

it seems a lot of people are fooled on the parts they buy, i would be more then happy to sell you a part from germany (even though it was made in taiwan and packaged in germany), the same goes for mufflers, does anybody realize that they still build type 2 upright motor buses in other countries, do you think that they import there mufflers from germany,not. i have access to 5 , , different manufacturers of bus mufflers, there are the hammer, grind oh sh_at_t ones out there but there are also 2 others beside you better use german mufflers out there, in brazil they make an OEM that means original equipment
manufacturer muffler that fits just as well as the german, there is also a junk muffler from brazil that fits like cr#p, most suppliers don't want to sell the good import because they can screw you on the junk and make more money, i have said this before, a dansk muffler from denmark
fits excellent, just like in the PORSCHE 356 world the the german is way to pricey and the dansk is as good if not better quailty, buy the way i have gotten leitritz mufflers that turned out to be dansk because leistritz oem manufact. couldn't keep up with demand, remember most suppliers today are only repackagers, check what you buy to see that the name of what you buy is stamped or cast into the part, i have gotten mexico ball joints in german parts boxes
and paid the german price for them, back to the mufflers i haven't had a problem with the brazil
OEM bus muffler, just my quarters worth again
