The front shift bushing is cheap, easy to change, and  made the biggest
difference for me.

As far as the steering some normal points of wear to check *before*
forking out the dough for the new steering box are:
tie rod ends
drag link (this was it for me. reduced my play by 50%)
and check the point where the steering hooks onto the front beam.

I don't have any experience with steering tightening up then loosening,
so these may not be your problem. However I'd think they were worth a
look first.
