&gt;What: 36 hp engine, acceleration seems to lag when you step on the gas (ok,
&gt;I know it's only 36 ponies) but if you put the foot all the way on the gas
&gt;or open the throttle by hand, the motor will actually die!

The later carbs have a linkage adjustment for the accelerator pump but
I don't think yours does.  It could be a broken accelerator pump
diaphragm maybe.  However if I was going to take it apart enough to
check that I'd just put in a new one from a carb kit. 

Have you checked around for vacuum leaks (carb base, intake manifold)?

Does it give any indication of whether it's getting too rich (black
smoke, &quot;bloopy&quot; sound to the exhaust) or too lean (backfire) when
it dies?  This might give a clue for adjustment.
