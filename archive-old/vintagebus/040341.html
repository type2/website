Ah shoot - I just remembered!  Gees my memories a mess!

I use the rivet but I shorten it so it 
just goes through the hole - I then 
weld the rivet stub from behind.

So from front you see the rivet head (like stock).
But from behind a shortened stub is welded rather
than the peaned.  The head also gives you 'center' when
you want to drill it out again....

As I said I can take a couple of photos.....

Yup!  Exactly right!

Flattening a bit of copper pipe (I use 1/2 inch water pipe)
and holding it against the hole from the front also allows you to get a nice
flat weld.  And you can just redrill the hole as often
as you like for replacement. 

I could take a pic (front and back of rim) of the 
finished job if anybody really wants to see em.....

Rob,

I'm just guessing here, but you're welding through the hole from the back
side
of the rim...right?  Not around the circumference of the clip....yes?
