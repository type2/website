Subject: RE: [VB] Highroof Rear Hatch

It is a distance away, but I think we have resolved this.  If you look at a 
highroof hatch from the side and use a staight-edge like a yard stick to 
measure the curvature of the highroof hatch, you will notice that the 
highroof hatch has less of a curvature in its shape than the standard panel 
van hatch.  Its the same dimenstions, but different curvature.  I am not 
near the hatches so I'm doing all this measurement remotely.

Thanks

&gt;
&gt;I hate to be obvious here, but have you tried to put it on? Unless the
&gt;highroof is a distance from you, that seems like the quick way to answer
&gt;this...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a procedure that I can follow to determine whether a
&gt;rear
&gt;hatch that I have fits a highroof panel van or a standard panel van?
&gt;I've
&gt;heard there is a difference in the hatch curvature between a highroof
&gt;and a
&gt;regular bus.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Charles
