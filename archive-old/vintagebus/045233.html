&lt;&lt; there are a few buses over here in sunny England that are riding on 
American Wheel Corp Radar wheels. They look pretty cool. How hard are they to 
come by, they are like hens teeth over here. &gt;&gt;

You are going to have a hard time finding them when you are looking for the 
wrong thing. They are Rader wheels, not radar. Just helping you to find some, 
and I know that some Rader owners cringe when they are pronounced wrong.
