Subject: Weatherstripping

I am replacing the outside seals of the crankout side windows on my '67 
EZ camper. I need to find a source for those seals/weatherstripping. I 
am located in So. California (20 minutes from Disneyland). A local 
source would be helpful but any source would do.

Thanks in advance for any help.

-Rocky

ps. I have thought of sealing it with a caulking type material but I 
would rather replace the seals with like kind.
