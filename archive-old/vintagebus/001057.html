First, the Short Version:

I arrived, I drank, the dog escaped, the DBG arrived, the dog went to jail,
I went to bed.  Got up, I got the dog out of jail, we did nothing. We ate,
we drank, we slept.  Curt and Shannon arrived, we did more nothing, we ate,
we drank, and we slept.  Got up, ate, we watched Walsh polish things, we did
more of nothing, we drank, we slept.  We got up, we left.

And now, a slightly more elaborated version:

After spending the past two weeks following the Detroit adventure making new
interior panels for the Westy (out of authentic Baltic Birch - NOT Morning
Wood as some people tried to lead me to believe), it was time to get ready
for Busses Doing Nothing.  This years event would once again be held at Lake
Shelbyville Illinois.  Friday before I left, I would have to go get me a new
tire of the correct size to replace the dinky spare I had been running on.
I went to SEARS because the last time I bought tires, they were the only
place in St. Louis that could still balance a wide-5 rim.  I needed a
195/75R14 load C to match my other tires.  They had one alright, a
&quot;Trail-Handler&quot; and it cost a sky-high 80 beans!  Well, I had little choice
in the matter since I had to have one today, so I plunked down the plastic.
The real kicker came though, when the tire guy sez he can't find the adapter
they used to use for the rims, so he can't balance it anyway!  The salesman
also told me the tire would have a &quot;slightly aggressive&quot; tread pattern,
Well, when I saw this thing, I learned how much of an understatement that
was!  This thing was a monster!  The treads are even studable on this thing!
The tire guy even had the audacity to ask me if I wanted the letter in or
out!  Geesh!  What do YOU think!?  &lt;grin&gt;

So, I went home, swapped tires, and the dog, the bus, the Trail-Handler and
I set off for a weekend of camping - just in time for rush-hour.   It was
then and there I made up my mind that one day soon, my bus will have Safari
windows.  I figure the water can just run right out one of the many gaping
rust holes in the floor.  It took nearly an hour to fight my way over the
Poplar Street bridge over to the Illinois side, and get ta scootin' down the
highway.   After a few hours of driving, I arrived at Eagle Creek State
Park, where I THOUGHT the camp-out was to be held.  My 1st coronary came
when I saw a sign that said the campground was full!!
I drove around a bit, and finding no busses in sight, I asked a few
stink-foots whom were admiring my bus (I bet that would look good with shag
carpet and a few dogs inside) if they had seen any other VW busses cruising
around.  They said no, but that I should try Deer Creek Park, over on the
other side of the lake.  Well,  with none of the local roads on any of my
maps, I set off blindly to find the other camp-ground, with a mere 1 liter
of gas or so left in the tank!  I found the other camp-ground in short
order, and had my 2nd coronary when I saw yet another sign that read
'Campground Full'!! I pulled up to the ranger booth, and asked if there were
other VW folks there.  He handed me a map, and told me how to get to the
loop.   When I arrived at the loop in question, I learned that the entire
loop had been reserved for us ahead of time by Kim and Chuck Fryer (in yet
ANOTHER VW I've never seen them in before).  Whew!

I picked a site that would be in the shade most of the day, but I was also
ankle-deep in fallen leaves and creepy-crawly things.  1st order of
business, I staked down the dog to get him outta the way for a while.  Then
I set up my side-tent, tiki-torches, and other things that tell people
you're a serious kamper.  I made myself a dinner of Gray-Matter Turkey
burgers, which were so bad they were good, and new Pringles Brand Salt N
Vinegar potato chips.  Also, one you can skip.  It didn't matter to me
though, because I hadn't eaten all day long, and I was about to pass out
&gt;from a headache that was raging.   I made my way over to the Fryer
encampment, where we told tall tales of bugs and busses, and I sample my
&quot;Hex Nut Brown Ale&quot; I had found at the grocery store.  How can you pass up a
beer named 'Hex Nut&quot;??

After a few hours, things were pretty slow,  so I headed off to bed.  I
snapped up the rear screen, put the dog in , and tried to get some shut-eye.
The headache (which was now so bad I was nauseous from it) and the
restlessness of the dog conspired against me.  The dog was jumping all over
the place, probably from the noises from woodland critters, and I was busy
trying to keep my Hex-Nut down.   Just as I thought the dog had settled
down... out the sh#$head went, right through the rear screen!  And he was
never to be seen again that night.  I stood outside a while trying to see if
I could find him, but it was no use, even if I could spot him, he wouldn't
come back to me anyway.  I went back to bed, and  little while later (about
3AM) I heard a few other busses pulling in, and the sound of tent poles
clanking in the night.  From my bus, I couldn't see who it was.

The next day, saw the persons clanging tent poles in the night was none
other than the DBG contingent.  Crusty and Dawn were there in the wussy-late
model camper, Dan in the infamous 'Arrow bus' and last but not least, Chris
and Juliet in her splitty camper.  I arose and had my traditional
powder-doughnut and orange juice breakfast, which Walsh mooched off me, and
set about greeting my cheese-head friends.  They were busy whipping up a
full 5-course continental breakfast with some special crack-laced bacon
Crusty had picked up somewhere unknown.  I learned of their adventure
getting there, which included Dan getting pulled over for his bus being too
loud!

After a while, I heard a few rumors that the ranger had been around asking
if anyone lost a dog.  I made my way over to the campground hosts site,
where I learned that indeed, Teddy the No-Brains Wonder Dog had been caught
by the ranger, and was being held captive in the main office.  A Illinois
state trooper even tried to give me ticket,  until I explained that I had
not set him loose on purpose!  So, I hitched a ride up to the office with
one of the campground maintenance guys, and the No-Brains Wonder Dog was
&quot;released on are own recognisense...  uh what we mean to say is uh, we felt
the institution no longer had anything to offer us..... say uh, is dat a him
or a her?&quot;

After recovering the Wonder Dog, it was high time to get about doing
nothing.  Most of the day was spent taking naps, and watching Walsh polish
anything he could get his hands on.  (No, not THAT, potty-brain).  Some new
arrivals raised a ruckus because the campground Nazis were trying to get
people to pay for 3 nights of camping, even if they were only staying 2.
Then they started giving away our reserved sights, which forced many late
arrivals  to double-up on spots, which wasn't very popular with some of the
hoity-toity Vanagon folks.

Much later in the day, Curt and Shannon arrived, completing the
representation from the St. Louis area.  Steve Lashely, Beni, all three
Ricks, Tom Neidensklinkenlonkenhoffer, and NEATO Prez. Bill Bowman were
big-fat no-shows.  Curt brought the real-deal Gray Matter burgers, and we
chowed on those and some bratwurst I had brought along.  Crusty gave Ted the
No-Brains Wonder Dog a big-fat T-bone, which was gone in approximately 1.3
Pico-Seconds.  That night, we talked, ate, drank, and were out-partied by
the very large Hispanic encampment at the end of the loop (dubbed &quot;The
Spic-Nik&quot; by guess who...)  The DBG, out-done in partying.... We must be
getting old or something.   The dog DID NOT get loose this time!

The next day was more of the same.  Neil wandered off to do some fishing,
and was never seen or heard from again until nearly dark.  We were about to
assemble a search party!   Throughout the day, many people in Dodge Caravans
and big Bronco 4X4's drove by staring and gawking at us.  The campground
Nazi suggested we set up sign that read: &quot;See the Hippies - 5$&quot; and charge
people to drive through...  Hippies eh?  Speak for thy self, you Fascist!
Neil finally came back just at dusk, with a big ole' stringer of blue-gill.
Dan's father in law made quick business of cleaning them, and Neil had the
best eats in the house that night.  That night, it was more stories and
drinkin!

The next day, Monday, it was time to say goodbye and break camp.  It was
looking like rain, so everyone was rushing along pretty good, especially
Walsh since we all know if his tent poles got wet, he'd have to spend
another 16 hours detailing them again ;-)   We all headed out as a group,
and stopped up the local roads for a ways.   Curt, Shannon and I peeled away
&gt;from the pack at a gas station, where it took 10.5 gallons to fill my tank!
Yikes!  It was also were my camper-colon finally gave out after 3 days....
Man  that one was picture-worthy!  You all should thank Jesus I don't own a
digital camera!  ;-)

We took a leisurely route home, and in a slight drizzle, I arrived back to
my humble abode, crusty, wet and stanky...  and hit the sack.

A few hours later, I was browsg through the want-ads for yet another
week.....  still no hope in sight.
