hello ty,

i guess i didnt make my point well.  My bus has quite a bit of original
glass, and what i do have i think is really cool.  I dont plan on updating
it.  But, if i didnt have original glass readily available, i'd make do
with whatever fit and was safe.

i guess the root of it is what i see as an overuse of the word need
nowadays...  If you have an acceptable replacement, but seek out a rarer
part instead, thats a want.  If you dont have anything that will work,
maybe thats a need.  I dunno, hope i havent offended anyone.  there are
things that i think i need, that other people may see as a want, i guess
its all relative...(i am planning on taking my bus to alaska next year, i
will, in my mind, need certain spares.  But others who are less focused on
being prepared may see my spares list as wants...)

so i'll apologize for the rant and hope all are having a very nice day :)

take care,

Steve
