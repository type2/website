Hi Adam&amp;Verna,
The wood and aluminum rack you speak of is a Westie roof rack!  Not really 
the best for lugging much cargo.  You might be better off contacting Tom 
Conner of Deer Park Washington, who makes custom metal VW roof racks.  That 
way if this is for your 62 Westie you can have him construct two racks for 
it.  One for the rear behind the sub-hatch and a forward one that even curves 
around with the front roof gutter.  These will carry much more wieght safer 
and look great.  Of course you might find a VOA or German made metal roof 
rack during the Vintage this weekend.   Eric&amp;Barb
