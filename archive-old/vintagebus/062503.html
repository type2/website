Subject: Re: [VB] HELP in Amirillo Texas

Amirillo is smack dab in the middle of buggy country and I'll bet there
isn't a tranny to be found in that area.  $500 for a late model type II
tranny is about right for around there, they eat those trannies like we eat
BBQ ribs!!  Maybe Bryant can find one and bring it back.

For Sean and John who have commented about the &quot;cow&quot;, we who know Britt hold
him in the highest regards and have very thin skin when it comes to comments
that may be made meaning to be funny, but are poorly timed.

When a person is stranded, that is no time to make jokes unless you plan on
fewer VW friends.


&gt; We haven't been able to find a trans reasonable price in Amerillo, 500
&gt; for a used plus core! Rich Kimbrough is putting one on a grayhound from
&gt; Phoenix and Britt should have it by tommorrow noon. Also Rex Rodgers has
&gt; called Britt with a list of names in Amerillo for Britt to try. It sounds
&gt; like it's all coming together with the HELP of the list, isn't this what
&gt; driving buses is all about. I feel sad for Britt though as he sent Bryant
&gt; on, so he is solo in Amerillo.  Will keep all the list updated.
