Dan,
Thanks for posting a positive note on your transaction. I've been in 
this hobby for a number of years and the anti-Japanese viewpoint has 
always bugged me. People get paranoid sounding like it's a plot to 
rid the US of every VW. I'm sure there are some Japanese businessmen 
that are scum of the Earth, as well as I'm sure that there are a 
number of Americans that are equally bad. But, I've had tons of good 
experiences buying parts and vehicles from people and I've never 
asked to see a passport. If I get screwed over on a deal it's the 
individual that did it (and my fault for not paying better 
attention), not the country.

I can get along with anyone, just not someone who's prejudiced. I'm 
very prejudiced against them.

Congrats on selling the BD quickly and for a good price!

Scott
