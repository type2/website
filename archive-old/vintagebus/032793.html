Hi, I use State Farm and up until a year or so ago, I only had liability and 
any other requirements in Arizona.  I have a 1961 Double Cab and, like you 
got to thinking about replacement of the vehicle.  I asked my agent and 
discovered that they would let me pick a 'classification' (I think is what 
they called it).  Basically I was allowed to pay for $1000-2000, or 
$2000-3000, or $3000-4000, and so on, worth of coverage on the truck itself.  
Since it still needs body, paint and a few other things, I only went with 
$3000-4000 worth of coverage.  They took a picture of the truck and noted any 
dents/condition so that I could not claim repairs on existing problems, and 
told me to let them know if/when any of these problems were fixed (including 
glass) so they could note the changes.  The beauty of it is that it only 
added about $8 per month to my premium!

I don't know if this is a nation wide thing with them or just state by state. 
 Hope this helps.
