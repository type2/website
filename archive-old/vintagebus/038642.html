&gt; We have never heard of 4-track tapes.  &quot;Playtape&quot; yes, but not 4-track.  Do
&gt; you possibly mean 8-track?
I don't believe it.  You guys know almost everything and you've never heard
of 4 track tape players.  They were the best.  Better fidelity that 8 track
(because there was 4 tracks on a 1/4 &quot; tape  instead of 8) and way better
tape handling.  8 track became popular because you could flip to four
different spots on the tape at any time but it was the playback head
bouncing up and down and soon went out of alignment.  4 track had two heads
and you switched between them.  Great decks, even better that cassettes.
I've got two players from Crag and sever dozen tapes from the '60's.  I hope
the crash didn't hurt, I had you on a high ped.
