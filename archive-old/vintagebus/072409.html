Subject: Re: [VB] buying 65' Splitty barndoor info requested

Congratulations! I would suggest getting a Bentley manual and browsing over the Samba_dot_com and Vintagebus_dot_com.  Ask around here and at shows for split bus facts and what not, most split owners are cool. A good start would be not calling a '65 a barndoor, as a barndoor was any bus produced before march of 1955.  Sean 65 Westfalia
