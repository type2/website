To see if the carb is icing:

Turn on bus

go round to back of bus and open engine compartment.

Look at carb and the manifld unde rthe carb

is there condensation?  ice forming.  TOUCH it-   cold and icy?


oh- info you didn't give was what your climate is-  what are morning temps?  
damp or dry?

 I suspect I may be having some carb icing problems, but I'm not really
 sure. Here is the scenario:
 
 Engine: 1600 sp, Solex pict-31, non-clogged manifold riser, pre-heat tube
 connected.
 
 Bus runs great in afternoon (warmer temperatures)
 Bus runs great after driven a little while
 
 Bus runs like crap first thing in the morning(cold) even after allowed to
 warmup for 15 minutes. After driving a couple miles, runs fine.
 
 When it is running badly, it misses and stumbles under acceleration,
 especially at lower RPM's (i.e. take off, up-shifting)
 
 Anyone have any ideas? Is this carb icing? If so, why? I have pre-heat
 connected and manifold riser is burn your fingers hot. Any help
 appreciated.
