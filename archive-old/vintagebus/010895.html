Subject: '67 shift linkage
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

    I am sure this is all in the arcives, but it's late, I'm 
tired/frustrated, and I want to get it all out there while it's still fresh 
in my mind.

    I just finished (for now) working on the shift linkage of a '67 delux for 
a guy I know.  I have never had occasion to work on one that new since my DC 
is a '61.  The forward shifter is obviously different as it has a pin mounted 
to the underside of the bus that sticks into the end of the forward shift 
rod, rather than the hanger and plastic bushing that is on my '61.  On this 
bus there is about 1/8 inch of play (the hole is 1/8 inch bigger than the 
pin).  I am sure that 1/8 inch of slop is much more than it should have, but 
here is the big puzzlement to me:  when fully installed and tightened down, 
the ball of the shift lever, is almost fully ABOVE the socket in the end of 
the shift rod.  This cannot be normal, can it?  If you press down on the 
shift lever as if you were shifting into reverse, the ball will then go into 
the socket, but at rest, it is almost all the way out of the socket.  The 
owner claims that everything worked fine up until a few days ago when he lost 
1st and 3rd.  Upon inspection, I found the head of the screw in the coupling 
between the front and rear shift rod had been broken off by a previous 
'mechanic', who apparently cut the forward rod and welded it back together 
after some repair or another.  I cannot tell if the alignment is correct or 
not.

In the course of tinkering, I found some bronze bushings that fit into the 
hole in the end of  the shift rod and they eliminated about 50% of the  slop, 
but the ball is still way up nearly out of the socket and now he has a hard 
time even finding 4th!  I think it is so far gone that doing anything to it 
was a big mistake.  Now I have made it worse!

Can anyone provide some enlightenment?  Is there some specific repair kit for 
this?  Could he have the wrong shift lever in it?  Does anyone have some 
good/correct parts they could sell me for him?

Desperate to save some face,
