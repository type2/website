Subject: GEX Engine tear down

  I am in the process of rebuilding a GEX engine (1600) for a customer. This
engine has a NEW case and heads with 3000 miles on it, this is what I found.

1. In tearing the engine down it had a CW crank (good) the bad was it was
20/20

2. They use Moresa P/L  the cheapest out there (rings on 1 piston never
seated)

3. The valves in the new heads were already mushrooming.

4. They installed new valve adjusting screws, which were already worn flat.

5. Excessive amount of Red RTV used under oil pump cover, which had gotten
into the engine

6. When pulling the oil strainer there was way to much foreign substance for
my liking (haven't figured out what it all was yet).

7. New Brazilian dished cam with new lifters, not enough miles to notice any
significant wear.

8. Excessive scoring of the split main bearing, this seems to show me a
dirty block when assembled.

Otherwise a pretty decent rebuild?

What I am doing to it. The case is at the machine shop getting a good douche
and cut for 90.5 P/L
New crank (cast 69 CW), rebuilt rods, new cam and lifters, new single port
heads. 26 mm gear oil pump or filter pump or sump filter.  Crank, flywheel,
pressure plate being balanced together, rods are being balanced end to end.
This should make an awful sweet engine for this BEAUTIFUL 67 21 window
Deluxe.

This bus is also getting a RANCHO 3.88 r/p 82 4th trans installed. All new
shift bushings and new brake LINES! Somebody jacked it up from the rear
frame rail and kinked the long line. WARNING; always be careful jacking up a
bus with belly pans, as the brake line runs along the bottom edge of the
frame!!!

Factoid. I watched the machine shop balance a NEW Cast CW crank it was out a
total of 14 grams! Less then some stock OG cranks I have had balanced. They
will balance to within 2 grams, if I get anal they will take it to 0 but
then the price goes up.
