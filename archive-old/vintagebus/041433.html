&gt; Greetings all,
&gt; 
&gt; An update.  Ronnie tells me that he sells the N207E bearing in either SKF,
&gt; INA, or Fag 
&gt; for 48.95 U S dollars each, he also has ones from Canada
&gt; that he sells for 24.95 each.
A note on some bearings.  I have installed a French 207 on my 67.  When I
installed it, I noticed with some irritation that the rollers were about
2/3 as long as the German bearings.  How they can call it the same bearing
doesn't make sense to me. It seems like it would be much less durable.
I don't know about the Canadian ones, but if you load your bus up it might
be worthwhile to get the expensive bearings.
