&gt;With father's day coming up, I'm thinking about upgrading my air
&gt;compressor. Right now I've got one of the infamous Sears Craftsmen 5hp 25
&gt;gallon oiless ones. I've already had to replace the piston and some other
&gt;parts on it which was WAYYY too expensive. And...it doesn't give me much
&gt;time during sandblasting before I have to wait on it.

* Sears National Customer Relations is the mediating arena- they are in place to
protect Sears personnel from flak during return/ exchange/ warranty complaints.
having toasted 3 units in a row-  all 6.5 h.p. 60 gal. vertical / oilless ,  producing
13 c.f.m. _at_ 90 psi., adequate for my modest paint/ sandblast cabinet demand.
the problem w/ the entire line of oilless product is the piston and rod. these
compressors are actually made by De Vilbiss, but are the cheaper, inferior line
marketed to Sears by a respectable company which has gone the way of
subdivision, and still manufactures a good product elsewhere.
i also received a totally useless crank call from the office of the president of Sears,
Mr. Martinez, known to every Sears employee as the man who signs their paycheck,
which failed to adress a single item in my list of complaints.
Mr. Phil Bauer, Craftsman Associate Brands Manager, is the guy responsible for the
De Vilbiss contract- and you will never get a response from that office. Better to
direct your complaints to Bob Villa !
if you use these compressors for more than an hour a day, they will not last more than one
year, or possibly a week past the warranty period at best.repair usually exceeds the cost
of a new compressor.

So...what SCFM should
&gt;I need to do blasting. I realize the bigger the better. I see a 7hp, 60
&gt;Gallon Oil-Lube that'll do 9.7 scfm _at_ 90 psi. 3 year warranty for $399.

* ok for most paint repair, may not hold enough for the entire driver's side of a bus.
HVLP guns need more air volume , like 13 to 17 scfm .
as for blasting, you will run out of air in under 3 minutes. other than toy spot-blasting,
3/16 or 1/8 inch nozzles require industrial compressors capable of sustaining  large
volume, and will be found at the business end of a machine w / 2-stage pistons,
that pump 175 psi and fill quickly. horsepower is no longer a standard of measurement,
thanks to Sears and other vendors- a Sears 6.5  &quot; rated horsepower &quot; motor is smaller
than the 1/2 h.p.  washing machine motor in my bench grinder . and not as powerful.
it's packaged kinda like a vw engine, made to look bigger than it really is.........

* you get what you pay for (except at Sears, and beware of the &quot; craftsman &quot; brand. ).
and read the warranty.... and as for the &quot;protection plan&quot;, that's the money we used to
pay to the &quot;mob&quot;, now you can charge it on your Sears card....
