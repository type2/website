Subject: Mexico Trip report and more pics posted ( finally!)
Message-ID: &lt;3741112C.631B_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

Hello List, Family, freinds, etc.

The trip report ( or, to be accurate, the first half) from our Mexico
journey is finally up and running.  More pics have been added, and about
20 pages of text.
Sorry this has been so long in coming.
Go to the URL at the bottom, and then click on the picture of the bus in
mexico, or the &quot;Mexico Trip&quot; text.
If that doesn't get you there, go staright to:

http://www.peak_dot_org/~maynardj/mextrrip.htm

Let me know how the page works, and if there are any problems with the
pics.
I tried to scan them as small as possible. There are a lot of pictures.

Thanks, and pass this on to anyone else you knwo who would be
interested.

It is after midnight here on the left coast, which makes it sometime
next thursday in the east. so please excuse my typing and incoherent
jabber....
