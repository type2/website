I am here in San Diego.
Who are the local type 2 folks?
My '62 15 window has nothing inside to go by.
I need to make a whole interior.
I need to get ideas from other DeLuxes.
I need the pieces behind the sunvisors and bows now.
I'm doing headliner first.  I need to see another one
so I know what gets covered on the sides and doors.
How far down around windshield glasses.
What do I glue to roof before putting in headliner?
How about on the sides around the windows?
Any padding under there?

Thank you all...
