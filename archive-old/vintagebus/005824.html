I think at this point we are all clear this is a cry for help. If anyone has
an NOS muffler for Everett's Kombi, he could really use it. That exhaust
leak is getting worse......

Humpty Dumpty was pushed. &lt;---(obligatory cute sig line that everyone seems
to be adding lately)

&gt; there are not five buses where i live.
&gt;
&gt; There may be 5  Buses at the house across  the street from me.
&gt; The owner always looks at my Bus and smiles.  Not the ok smile
&gt; of &quot;Hey there, nice Bus ya got&quot; but a weird smile of &quot;I have a
&gt; few of those that I bet you wish you could check out&quot;.  Dammit
&gt; man, stop smiling at me!  And stop watering your weed-infested
&gt; lawn by hand for  4 hours each day, all the  time staring dir-
&gt; ectly at my garage door
