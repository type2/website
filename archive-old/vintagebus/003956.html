&gt;Is this possible to have the small hatch on a b_at_y or
&gt;is it just an error in reproduction?

yes and no! lotso  &quot;early&quot; bay windows came with small pop tops from various
camper converters, in the states, there was ASI, Sundial, Sportmobile, just
to name a few. I guy I know has an &quot;ASI&quot; small top in a 73 (is that right
jack) in the UK Devon made several different conversions, like the moon
raker. Matchbox does not always recreate an accurate reproduction
