&gt; I have a set of duel 40's in good condition I want to use on my new stroker
&gt; motor (1955). Currently the ventures in them are size 34. I have been told
&gt; this size is great for bugs and buggies that want to go fast, but for
&gt; drivability in a bus I should look for size 28 or 30 to replace them. Anyone
&gt; want to comment on this? Also anyone have the parts for sale / trade.
&gt; Thanks in advance,

Hey Shawn,
Yeah, you probably want to go down on the venturis.  I'm running 28s in my
2L 914 engine.  You'll probably need to go down on jet sizes too.  The
smaller the venturi the more vacuum so it pulls more fuel through.  I'm
running 115 mains on mine right now, these are weber 40IDFs though.  I may
need to go leaner but I'm at some altitude.  Smaller venturis give better
low end torque, depending on what cam you have.
I tried running 34 venturis on my 2L type 1 engine with stock cam, 1.4
ratio rockers and it was a dog using 42DCNFs.

John
