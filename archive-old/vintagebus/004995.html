Steve,

   It's tough finding info on anything beyond the stock stuff. 1. VW
didn't engineer the vehicle to do what you want, 2. Adding anything to
the stock adds a lot of variables. Carb is different, distributer is
different, exhaust, oil cooler, etc. Some have gone down some of these
roads, but  not your exact one. Gotta learn as you go, and let the list
know. We're getting smarter by learning collectively.
