Subject: Sunroof Minutia question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Was comparing two different bus sunroofs today.  One from a '57 and one from 
a '67.   I noticed that the handles as well as the rails that fasten to the 
bus are different.  Evidently there is at least two different styles of 
sunroofs for the bus (I know there are 3 or more cloth sunroofs for the bug)  
Anyone know more about this?
