Subject: New Hot Wheels Drag Bus (Single Cab)

I was over at my hobby shop getting a new R/C bug, 
and there, right in front of me, were two of the 
new Hot Wheels Drag Buses.  One that was black and 
yellow, the other was a white signle cab.

Pic of it there.  I picked up two of them, and one 
now sits in my office and one in my &quot;stash.&quot;  Woohoo!

Paul
