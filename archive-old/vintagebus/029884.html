Guys, from what OG two tone buses I've seen the factory norm was from
Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
beltline. 59 and on the top color whether it be grey-biege, cumulus
white or whatever was painted over the entire bus and the bottom color
was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the beltline down.

Evidence can be seen when the OG paint fades and shows the base color
through i.e. the 20K SWR G-B 23 window at OCTO in June, you could see
spots of grey-beige coming through the sealing wax red. Then look at a
number of faded deluxes and standards and such from the 50's and you'll
always see the bottom color coming through the top color.

Darker colors over lighter colors. This should be the norm in painting a
car as the tint will shift when applying in the opposite order unless
you want that (then you have to make sure your coats are even. White is
not as opaque as you think. Plus white goes a long way and takes paint
less to cover  Also remember you want to use a primer and sealer that
will hide under white as well (not a dark primer).
