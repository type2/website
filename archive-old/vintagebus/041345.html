Geez Erin
Why dont you scramble through that stack and throw together a beater
engine and make a drivable bus and keep your rebuild for when you have the
cash. Im sure that actually havinga drive in it even if its far from
finished will change your outlook a lot.

This is the season when we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the
magic pumpkin to the Feral Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On
Earth and six more weeks of winter.
