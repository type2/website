Tom Young mentioned that it might be a good idea to try turning the engine
by hand. Lo and behold, it couldn't turn. I pinched the belt a little and
(whateveritwas) popped loose. I searched for it a little but there's no
jaggies now that I can find just from turning the pulley. Starter works
fine. Bus starts.

I pulled then engine this past weekend (want to infuriate yourself? Wedge a
72 tank into a 64 bus, re-install the engine, then ascertain that you
forgot to put the wire on the fuel gauge sender. Start over) and I'm trying
to think if there is some way I left something in the bell housing but I
remember wiping it down because there is a slow transmission leak. It was
clear. Maybe the bushing is falling apart per Steve Dolan's suggestion. I
better pull it AGAIN and check it out this weekend.

Thanks to everybody, I don't know how we'd keep on without the list!

BTW, you're right, Sean has the drill down and I should have gone there first:
