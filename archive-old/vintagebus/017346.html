I've had solenoid trouble before and got a used starter with solenoid on it
from a dude I know. I only used the solenoid and put it on my old starter
and replaced the battery cable. Things have been fine for a year but then it
acted up again, so I performed the John Muir tapping method with great
success. BUT....... where can I, if anywhere, can I get a new solenoid
without another starter attached to it?  It's a 12v starter in my '65
Microbus with a 1600 dp.      Thanks people,
                                                                            
                                       Jim J.
