Subject: RE: [VB] Hula Girl/BobbinHead website.

I do have a 'Moon' gas pedal that amazingly almost fits to the stock
pedal mounts (I'll modify the pedal, not the vw) and I recently picked
up an 'Eelco' brand barefoot dimmer switch pedal.

... all in the name of fun.

&gt; Anyway, I've been looking for a vintage antenna topper from the 60's
or
&gt; early 70's and a vintage pair of fuzzy dice.

what you need for your 60s/70s vintage speed double cab is a pair of
bare feet!
