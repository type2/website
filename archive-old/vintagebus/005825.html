Hi,

What ever happened to the fine mesh screen filter in the fuel pump?
And hey, there is supposed to be another one in your gas tank over the
outlet!!  If it makes it through both screens it will likely make it
through your smallest carb jet too. It seems to me that the list
generaly agrees that &quot;the factory&quot; knew what it was doing. Do you
really need anything more? Gas in this country is normally pretty
clean stuff. Where are you all drivin? Mexico?

Just my 2 cents.

Chris
