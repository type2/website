At the risk of re-re-rehashing a subject.
Doesnt it seem more like the
busses were sprayed whatever the inside color
was first and then the upper or lower other color was done after?
 



&gt; Thanks all for the beltline answers.  Summary: the final finish is
&gt; that the belt is the same colour as the upper part of the bus, and the
&gt; second colour is from the lower edge of the belt down.  Details vary
&gt; as to what order the colours were applied.
