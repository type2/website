Subject: re: Insurance on VW collector cars--

We own and drive 4 early VWs--at this time J.C. Taylor is our carrier
and has been for some 15 years--they accept our values as stated--with a
photograph. I do not have any Mega-buck VWs--just drivers--But what i
have them appraised at, covers my replacement--As an NADA -VW only
appraiser, for some 13+ year  I do have a knowledge of what VWs are
worth and Never charge for my services--But i must be able to see the
car in person.--I did a couple of appraisals at  BBB IV and also when in
Pomona--If you can get  copy of Hemmings Motor News several classic car
insurance companies are listed with 800 numbers and they can be of
help--Some Do have a problem with VW values --I'm working on that as of
now--But by showing the going prices in newspapers--VW newsletters, and
cyberspace you can back up your figures--Within reason!! If any of you
have any questions  --just let me know--
--TWWM, uj
