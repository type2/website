Subject: road trip?

Hi list,

This is a call to all thinking about  traveling
x country in their bus within the next 3 months?
Is anyone going west to east on the US mainland?
I've driven cross country by myself in early buses and would like to
make a caravan of two or three splits or upright bays.
My folks' farm is near Rolla, MO; I'd like to visit them.

Aloha
