Subject: Frozen bolts - tranny removal.

I've been lurking for quite a while and learning a lot from this list.  But just
recently I've started having trouble with the tranny in my '58 SC and I need
help from &quot;the experts&quot; to get it back on the road.  A few weeks ago, while
driving to a local show, I lost all but third gear.  Since the tranny had been
leaking just enough fluid to make keeping it full a nuiance, (and since I doubt
that if has ever been pulled .... 75,000 miles... original 36 hp and split case
tranny), I decided to pull it and have it gone through and replace the bushings
at the same time.  Over the last several weeks, I've been slowly getting it to
the point of pulling out the tranny, (ie, engine out, brake lines disconnected,
starter pulled, etc.), but I'm still not quite there yet.  Which brings me to my
current problem.... how do I get off the 8 bolts (4 on each side) that hold the
RGB's to the spring plate?  I gather from other posts that these are easy to
break off, and I don't want to do that if I can avoid it.  I've been hitting
them with PB blaster, but so far, the still don't budge.  I have a cheater bar
but I'm hesitant to lean on it too hard.  Any suggestions from the masters of
fasteners?
