Thom axed:

&gt; Does anyone have a picture of how an early westy tent is supposed
&gt; to mount at the rear?  I was just jamming mine into the hole in
&gt; the side of the bumper, which is incorrect, and I wont
&gt; want to do that when I get my bumpers all pretty.
&gt; 
I dunno, Thom - you talking about a &quot;privy&quot; style tent? 
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/pitch/p_erect.html shows the
&quot;incorrect&quot; method you refer to and AFAIK it's from factory lit.  Would
love to know how if otherwise.

BTW that option also works if you put one on a 68 westy. ;-)
