&gt; What is the correct torque spec when I put the wheels back on? (will get

Hi Billy,
85 Ft. Lbs.

&gt; Is is likely that the drums' threads are damaged like the bolts? what to 
&gt; do?

Replace drum.

&gt; Are the RGB's supposed to sag (camber direction) when the back of the bus 
&gt; is on jackstands?

If you mean downward as the bus is jacked upward then yes.  Otherwise the 
suspension would not be pushing downward and would just lower the bus till its 
rear dragged.
