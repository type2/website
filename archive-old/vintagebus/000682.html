&gt;  I own a 66 westy and i really dont know a lot about it and I was wondering
&gt;  if anyone could tell me what i have
You have a splitty, yahoooo!  Splitties RULE (or was that bench seats that 
rule?, yeah right)

&gt;  &lt;&lt; 1) Should i use Mig or oxy acetylene( I have both) can you also 
&gt;  recommend wire, tips etc.&gt;&gt;
&gt;  MIG is best, using the oxy 
&gt;  acetylene for brazing results in paint bubbling in a year, or two due to 
&gt; flux damage.
I mostly use MIG with 30 mil wire.  I also do brazing with a 0 tip on heat 
sensitive and delicate areas (read thin metal), but the flux problem in new 
to me, and seems to make sense due to the acid.  I sandblast and clean with 
solvent after brazing. E&amp;B think this will help with the flux problem?  I 
think Bob Hoover was mentioning that he was doing a lot of body brazing, 
somethin about experimenting with brazing.

&gt;  &lt;&lt;2) What sources do you use for replacement panels,&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Well so far we have used cannabilized parts so far, but you might want to 
&gt;  check with Ronnie about new stuff.
Ronnie worked for me, very pro, fair prices and I like how he answers the 
phone.

&gt;  &lt;&lt;3) do you use sandblasting for rust removal&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Yes, and sandpaper, wire wheels, phosperic acid, and lots of elbow sweat.
If I can see it, I sandblast with Dupont StarBlast, try it.  Found the black 
beauty too corse.  I use a pressure blaster from www.tiptools_dot_com, very good 
product at fair price.  I have had no problem with panel distortion. Nozzel 
size is completely compressor capacity driven, and I use a fairly small 
nozzel (3/32).  Tip Tools make a nice unit for this size, and I don't need 
much more for sheet metal.  

&gt;  &gt;&gt;4) How do you remove the old panels, Die grinders, sabre saws, nibler, 
&gt;  plasma etc.&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Yes, yes, yes,etc., plus chisles, hacksaw, abrasive blades in circular 
saw, 
&gt;  even the MIG welder itself, and anything else that will cut.
E&amp;B are correct in using the tool that fits the demolition job at hand.  Used 
with care and restraint, I like a sharp air chisle.  Spot weld cutter works 
okay if you can find the spot welds under he rust, they like to hide on me.
   
&gt;  &lt;&lt;5) Can you give me some sample repair time of lets say the front floors. 
 &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;  Sorry, but that could be anything from 10 minutes, to 10 days depending on 
&gt;  the damage.
I would be very happy if I could finish mine in 10 full-time-8-hour days!  I 
work really slow since I have a tendance to screw up if I get going to fast.  
Opps, there goes that air chisle again!

Frank, as an experienced welder you should have very few problems.  Good 
luck.
