&gt;I am trying to remove the centre cap from the front wheel bearing housings.
...
&gt;Is there some special tool used to get this cap off?

I use the claw end of a claw hammer. First, push the little square dealy that was held on with the pin into the cap...that is the speedometer cable; you're just getting it out of the way. Now, put the claw under the back end of one side of the cap...pry out a little. Now do the other side and go back and forth until the cap comes off.

Viola!  ;) Joe
