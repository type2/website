Subject: RE: [VB] Steering box

  Walter at The Bus Boys has given me a lot of insight into the steps =
and
procedures necessary to PROPERLY rebuild a steering box. There are many
companies that rebuild (oops I ,meant refresh), kin of like a restored =
bus
(oops gain I mean refurbished, freshened up) or a rebuilt carb (oops I =
mean
rekitted). There are people who just take them apart and peen the =
sector,
reseal them and then there are people who actually re machine parts and
rebuild them.=20
  Call the people that do them and ASK exactly what they do, that is =
the
best way to get the rest of the story.

ronnie  knowledge is wonderful, don't be afraid to ask the people in =
the
know

I don't have any experience building steering boxes,
but I do know that there are only two adjustments
available IF the worm and sector are OK, and in a bus,
the bearings on the sector pin.  Bushings for the
sector shaft (pitman arm shaft) are replaceable, and
bearings for the worm and steering shaft which, on a
bus, I believe are one piece.

The adjustments include, first, end play on the worm
bearings, and second, the engagement of the sector
(follower) in the worm gear.  Far as I know, the worm
gear end play is adjusted with shims in most cases,
but I do know Chevy 4x4's have an adjustment for end
play w/ a lock nut.

This knowledge is gleaned from years of reading
procedures, and I hope it's clear.  Now, wasn't
Wolfsburg West offering a kit with a shaft with worm
gear, sector piece w/ bearings and other little pieces
in their catalog a while back?  Or was it the TRW
incorrect stuff?  I was planning on trying to use it
to fix a box, but never saw it for sale.
