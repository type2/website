I went to Salt Lake City, Utah this last Sunday to pick up my new 1963 
Riviera camper. After having a great day with the sellers parents (very 
hospitable people) I finally received the bus and departed at about 3:00pm 
for home. The first night I made it to Laramie, Wyoming. Stopping for food at 
just before midnight the bus would not restart, the battery was seriously 
drained. 

The next morning I called McCarty Motors and had the vehicle towed over 
there. Very nice people--very competent service manager, Travis, who actually 
worked on my car himself. Long story short, It was diagnosed with a faulty 
voltage regulator and the part was ordered from Denver. I was able to leave 
after spending 1.5 days extra in good ol' Laramie! Note to self: add voltage 
regulator to list of spares to carry. 

Having used up any extra time I had at the service center in Laramie, I 
really needed to hit it hard the rest of the way. I drove pretty much 
straight thru stopping only to refuel and rest briefly. Lots of thumbs up all 
the way back. A great conversation starter especially at rest stops. Average 
fuel mileage returned was 28 mpg. Excellent mileage especially considering I 
had devil winds to battle all the way. The bus held well in spite of these 
high winds. The steering feels tight. The bus actually feels like its brand 
new. It took about 30 hours to make that final leg of the journey. I was 
tired, but the bus felt ready to drive back across country! 

All in all, after the hiccup with the charging system, the bus never missed a 
beat. It drove admirably and gave us a chance to get to know each other. Man 
and machine. It looks like the bus is ready to provide our family with many 
great adventures. 

Because of my closeness to quality service I never needed to call upon any of 
the AIRS members but it was nice to know they were there just in case.
