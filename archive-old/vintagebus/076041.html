&gt;&gt;that is, if i HAD a radio! i'm going to get a cheap one and stick it
&gt;&gt;under the seat, as all i need it for is to pick up the ipod signal
&gt;&gt;and power speakers.
&gt;
&gt;Most car radios I've played with don't pick up anything without an
antenna.  However, antennas are easy to make.

on further study today, what i REALLY want to do is forego the radio 
at all; instead, i am on the hunt for some powered 12v computer 
speakers! if i can swozzle them in to a cigarette lighter jack, and 
plug them into the ipod headphone output, viola. all the potential 
thief will see are some fugly computer speakers and a jack sitting on 
the dash. the ipod will travel w/ me.


matt, i don't suppose that massive brain of yours knows the milliamp 
output of a vw ciggy jack?  :)
