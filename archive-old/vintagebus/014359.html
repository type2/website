I have to second both of these suggestions (well, I got my harness
from RMMW, but it's probably the same source).  Having the *right*
diagram helps immensely.

As to splicing new wire into the middle, realize that you've doubled
the number of connections, and connections are the number one place
that wires fail.  It's far better to get a new real harness, with
proper colours, than to replace single wires or put in splices.

I would also suggest having a helper.  Makes getting things together
in the front a little easier.  With a helper, I'd say wall time was on
the order of eight or ten hours.  The job was spread across several
evenings, so it took us a while to remember where we were each day.
Also, some parts of the harness just didn't want to come out.  Getting
the new one in was quite straight forward.  Also took a little while
to figure out we should just completely ignore the &quot;diagram&quot; that came
with the harness.
