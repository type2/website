Ahh, but I didn't say &quot;uncut&quot; factory dimension head.  Re read my post.  I
might not have been very clear on the important detail.  I was using REBUILT
heads (mine were from Rimco).  Almost all &quot;rebuilt&quot; heads are fly cut to clean
them up.  Some more than others.  This shrinks the head volume and thus raised
the compression.

I have a set of rebuilt a set heads sitting around that have chamber volumes of
44 and 45 cc respectively.  I think new uncut heads are to be 50 cc???  Not
sure.  Point is, if you don't cc and do the calculations, you MIGHT have too
high a CR.  Then again you MIGHT not?

I was just pointing out that you should measure to be sure.  My .060 was only
an example of my specific situation with the motor I'm currently building.

Hope that is clearer.

Steve
