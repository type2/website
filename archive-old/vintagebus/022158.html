Since when does a guy selling a vehicle in NC have some &quot;responsibility&quot; to 
to sell said vehicle to a guy in FL who has displayed little more than bad 
attitude at how he has been screwed over at every turn?

Seems to me he owns the vehicle and can sell it to whoever he wants to...

Hell, I'd be afraid to sell you a pack of gum.  You might be able to turn 
it into the &quot;GA Gum Conspiracy&quot;.

&gt;Hmmmm....thats odd since I tried to get info on buying the complete bus and 
&gt;all I got was the run around. I hate it when you ask specific questions and 
&gt;all you get are a couple little word answeres that dont answer what you 
&gt;asked. Like when you ask if the complete vechile is for sale and the answer 
&gt;you get is that its a total piece of rust. Dont know about ya'll, but that 
&gt;boggles my mind.
