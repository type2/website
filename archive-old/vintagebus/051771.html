I would rather see the pink and green split parked on
top of the owner... :)

&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I prefer the vintage look, but I make
&gt; drivability 
&gt; &quot;improvements&quot; like engine, tranny, etc.  Oh, and a
&gt; CD player.  But
&gt; here's the deal, the folks pounding on others for
&gt; lowering, etc: wouldn't
&gt; you rather see a lowered pink and green split parked
&gt; at the store than a
&gt; H*nda or Ch*vy?  All the more power, especially if
&gt; the bus was going away
&gt; forever.  Besides, most mods can be reversed easily,
&gt; and if they can't,
&gt; it would probably take less work to &quot;restore&quot; the
&gt; bus after the mods have
&gt; been done than it would from scratch.  So if
&gt; non-vintage REALLY bothers
&gt; you, just consider that they're keeping it rust free
&gt; until they sell it
&gt; to a vintage nazi.
&gt; 
&gt; Amen
