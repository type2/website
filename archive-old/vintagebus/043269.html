Hello listees,

After 8 months abroad in SouthEast Asia, I am back on the list (first
time I have been off the list since early '96). I'm gonna be goin' on the
road again, and must clear out a bunch of stuff. Some of it is for free,
some will have cheapo prices on them. There's useful stuff here, so
check. I'm in San Francisco, Sunset District.

I'd prefer not to ship, but if necessary on some items if there is a big
need, I'll consider. I've been bussing for 29 years, I know what a needed
part is about! 

Email me, come over, look and take freebees, make offer if prices are
too high. Take it all! ;-)   Cheers!
