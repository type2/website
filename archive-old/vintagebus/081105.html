Subject: RE: [VB] [F] any UK listees want to get me some beer?

Actually, I only got about 6 cases of trappist in the tipper when it
came over in the boat.  The hydraulic pump takes up some of that space.
Also note that I gave up the spare tire carrier in the v80 just to get
more beer in there although I just wished they had just put it in the
cab.

Harry asked:
How many cases of beer can a tipper carry?
