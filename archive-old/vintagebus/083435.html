Subject: the 20th &quot;Buses Nowhere Near The Arch&quot; event...

Hi all,

We're in the final stages of preparations for the upcoming BNNTA VW camping
weekend.  From our end, the printing is done, trophies are here, the event
t-shirts turned out beautiful, our event's '59 Panel Bus is all loaded up
with tents, bikes, event supplies and door prizes for the trip to the
lakeside campground.  The initial weather forecast looks great, so we're
getting excited to see everyone again for a long holiday weekend full of
Type 2 and VW camping fun!

If you need any info on the event, please visit our simple web site:
http://www.bnnta_dot_com    There is a Mapquest link at the bottom that should
direct you right to the location on Mark Twain Lake (about 30 miles due west
of historic Hannibal, MO).  As at past events, I've leased the entire group
campground at the Indian Creek recreational Area right on the Lake and we
will again restrict access to only VW's of ANY kind or era!  When you wake
each morning, all you'll see are Volkswagens and their happy owners.  The
Corp of Engineer Rangers are looking forward to our arrival, and have even
offered to block traffic during our Saturday scenic caravan across the
Cannon Damn as we cruise over to tour Hannibal.  I imagine that there will
be fierce bribing for votes for the various BNNTA Bus Awards, especially in
the hotly contested Best Group Theme Camping awards.  It'll be fun to see
what your campsites will be decorated as...

We wish everyone a great Labor Day holiday weekend wherever you'll be, and
hope that you have a safe journey to join us at BNNTA or wherever you'll be
travelling to!
