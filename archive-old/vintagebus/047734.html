&lt;&lt; Didn't the front trailing arm bearings go from phenolic to needle bearings 
at this time also?  Also the diameter of the front wheel cylinders was 
enlarged I believe.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Ted,
In 64 the outer phenolic bushings were replaced with needle bearings.  1965 
the inner phenolic bushings were replaced with needle bearings.  While the 
change to needle bearing was an improvement in bearing longevity, but not 
stuctural strength.  The cylinder bores of the brake sytem did not change 
during the 1955-67 era.  The only real change in the wheel (Slave) cylinders 
is that the bores had to be moved outward to keep thier centerline in line 
with the wider drums and shoes.
