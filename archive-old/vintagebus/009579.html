I thought I'd throw a plug in for Buses and Balloons coming up in October.
As I understand it, the raffle will also involve a rebuilt longblock as the
grand prize.
Wake up and watch 600 or so hot air balloons launch while sipping your
coffee.

I mailed Cletus Riedel the illustrious editor in chief of Splitzine and this
is the reply:


&gt;John,
&gt;You can inform the type two list that Busses and Balloons is in
Albuquqerque,
&gt;New Mexico, October 3rd, with camping starting the night of the 2nd through
&gt;the 4th. It is a top 10 judged, 10 specialty voted carshow, and swap meet.
A
&gt;raffle is also happening, with prizes from West Coast Metric, Simple, Rocky
&gt;Mountain Motorworks, etc. to benefit the Road Runner Food bank.
&gt;Entry to show/camp/swap is $15, and general admission is $2 or 2 canned
goods.
&gt;If anyone needs more information, they can email me at splitzine2_at_aol_dot_com,
or
&gt;call me at 505-260-4570.
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Cletus
