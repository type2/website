Message-ID: &lt;81qcae$jkk0_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

it's nice to know when there are people who truely care,
thanks to the many people of the list that voiced there concerns 
and well wishes to type2parts_dot_com (old volks home) fire situation.

we started clean-up today and got phones up and the power ready to
turn back on. am going to fire (ha ha ) up the computers on monday
and hope i didn't loose my data base.

many thanks again to all that offered help, but are to far away, but 
just the thought was enough help to me.

i would especially like to thank VWHOWARD, he was at the shop before me 
ready to go and jumped right in to help get things done, without his
help my wife and i would still be there working.

the biggest lose to me was part of my toy collection which was boxed up
over 10 years ago with cars that i had been collecting since a kid,
the amazing part was that out of all the toys 4 or more vw buses
survived!!
good oman, does anybody have a couple tires for a lone star bus.

a lot of my porsche stuff (356) got wasted but a lot is still good, to
bad
all my original upolstery door panels got wasted, as john (vwhoward) put
it, this proves that you should put all your focus on buses, so it be,
i say!
major porsche parts fire sale soon&gt; 



again THANKS to all on the list
