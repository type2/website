Subject: any experience with doublecab gates...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I want to remove my gates on my 63 doublecab (to restore and keep safe by not 
having them stolen until restoration is complete) 

I fear attempting to remove as im sure they have never been off in 
37 years.  what am I in for? how should i best go about gettting the screws 
out...will they break? will where they are bolted in break?

also....how best to treat loose(?) rust inside...that I can hear everytime 
you lift gates up/down....     

thanks
