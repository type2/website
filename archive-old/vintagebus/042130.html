&gt; No, its a matter of their Webhost (burlee_dot_com)  being too lame.
&gt; Arizonabusclub is hosted on a webhost not a ISP. Mine works fine both ways


Umm.  ISP is a general term. Interet Service Provider.  That term covers
any form of internet service...be it access, hosting, colocation, etc...


&gt; I shopped around to different Domain hosts to make sure I got one that could
&gt; do non www.  Lots of em cant do it or charge extra for it. Same goes for
&gt; webhosts. If you think its lame, talk to everett, he set that site up.


Actually, to be speific and technical, there are two ways to do this. 

In the zone file for the domain they need to set EITHER an A record or a
CNAME for the _at_ portion of the zone.

IF they set an A record, the record must point to an IP address.  Then the
web server that corresponds to that IP must be configured to respond
correctly. (if the web server uses a seperate IP address for each website,
no further configuration should be required.  but if the server uses host
headers then a second (or even a wildcard..) host header should be
defined that will match on &quot;domain_dot_com&quot; in addition to &quot;www.domain_dot_com&quot;)


Alternatively one may set a CNAME instead of an A record.  This is
essentially an alias, and has to point to a FQDN (fully qualified domain
name).  so for the _at_ section of the zone, they set a CNAME record that
will point to the www A record.

This will require an additional step when your resolver tries to find an
IP to associate to the name, but the webserver will see the same
www.domain_dot_com host header that it saw previously...


but i digress.

all off topic.  I fail to touch on many points of why or why not to do
these things on purpose.  

(YES an http:// is realisticly a must for a URL.  it is a vital section of
the URL!  NO a mailto: should NOT be appended to an email address.  this
IS email and you KNOW what an address looks like, and that it will not be
confused for something else.  http://www.type2_dot_com/pub/README  and
ftp://www.type2_dot_com/pub/README are two entirely different files. and hence
the http:// or ftp:// portion of the URL determines which access protocol
to use. If you are writing .html use mailto:. If you are writing email,
dont. bitch bitch moan moan.)
