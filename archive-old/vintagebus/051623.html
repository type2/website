Subject: Re  Saw a bus in Reno

***************************************************
I know this will be trivial, but I ran up behind a
brown (I think) split bus this last Monday, I think
they are on the list
***************************************************

Hey again AJ
I dont think there is anybody active on the vintage
list except you and me in the area. Maybe there are a
couple of lurkers (Jim?) in the Reno area?? There are
only a handful of splits on the road in the Reno area,
but, there sure are quite a few sitting behind people
houses (always keeping mental note of where for future
reference). You posted a while back of your start of
the Deluxe resto, hows it going? Is the Deluxe on the
road yet- can I see, can I see.
