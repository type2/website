Subject: Re: [VB] Welding trouble

The tack method Steve uses is the way i do most of my butt welds , the
trick is that i can bump the heat up to 2 on the weldpak and get full
penetration with out touching my wire speed for the most part, i'm not
sure where i'm running at on wire speed but i can look today and let you
know . 
----------------- Clip ----------------
Preparation is everything on welding old, rusty or corroded metals.
I've found that backing the thin work with more steel pop riveted to hold
the pieces holds them well enough to get the spot welds done. I've also
found that hand feeding wire as filler along with the wire feed helps in
making the near impossible welds. This get around to HeliArc techniques
or acetylene welding techniques.
I've also found that generic coat hangers and acetylene will give good
results at low heat to get a few tacks in place.
Short term you're not going to go blind if you use the right welding hood
and lenses. Most of my problems came about because I built myself a new
steel building with a shiny galvanized inside sheet metal roof. The
flashback got to me in short order.
