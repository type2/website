Yes; take a blowtorch and hack the bulkhead out, making the most 
gnarly ragged cut that you can.  Then put in 2 914 seats, each
from a different car.  Don't actually bolt them donn, just let them
sit there.  Drill a couple holes at random in the seat pedestal,
like you're planning on making it bolt up, but don't let the holes
you drill line up with the seat.

&gt; for a more comfortable, more modern seat, preferably from a newish Japanese
