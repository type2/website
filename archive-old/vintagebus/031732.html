  The NOS front floor panel has been digitized and is off getting the die
made as I type, WILL be ready for viewing at the CLASSIC, also should have
rockers, rocker floor section and related pieces ready by then also. 
  Still need a NOS corner and any other NOS sheet metal to copy. Pieces can
be purchased outright, rented to us, loaned, etc. All pieces will be
returned within 2 weeks.
  A original/or damn good repo windshield seal has been sent to Germany
today to be copied, this is one with MOLDED (formed) corners. This item will
take a couple months to make.
  I also will recieve by Friday complete German brake LINE kits for the post
55 to 67 type 2 buses. I don't have a price yet and won't say anymore till I
fit them to a bus (just happen to have one here that needs them).

ronnie  az.   trying my damest to get good quality parts for our buses
