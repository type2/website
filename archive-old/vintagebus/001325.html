Lots of these stories should be in the archives, Stephen, as it's been
discussed often on all 3 Lists.

This is the most destructive example I've heard of, however, and the
perpetrators are usually US Customs types.

I'm forwarding a copy of my comments on the Type 2 List as a separate post.

Ouch.  This was on the loaf list, but of note to anyone who drives into
Canada. What they heck were they thinking?  Anyone have experience like
this?

Hey all. . .
So after putting in the second generator in a week I
decided it was time for a road trip.  I packed up the
bus with all the essentials for longterm camping,
loaded up my cameras, threw in the old 1957 manual
typewriter and hit the road, heading to the U.P. of
Michigan and beyond.  The bus finally ran right for
more than the average 100 miles it seemed to last
recently.  The colors in Northern michigan were
unbelievable.
I decided to head into Canada, crossing at Saut Ste.
Marie.  Big mistake.  I got stopped as I was crossing
over.  Canadian police (Mounties?) proceeded to tear
apart my car looking for drugs presumeably. Ripping
off door panels, opulling up carpet. . .   They even
cut the vinyl on my rear bench seat and ripped the
padding out.  After nearly three hours of this and
much protestation on my part they let me on my way.  I
proceeded on to Montreal, and places east.
Then, coming back into the States into Vermont I was
detained again by Canadian authorities, asked to
remove all of my belongins and they once again
searched my car.  Fine, whatever...I have nothing to
hide. . .
Two weeks on the road softened the blow of this
harrassment, but I honestly feel that they pegged me
because of the Vehicle I drive.  Has anyone had
similar experiences?  Do I have any recourse for the
damage caused, particularly to my rear bench seat,
which was original.  Can I sue Canada?

BTW the trip was great, the beast ran excellent.
