 This is where you should post our complaint. You can also do a search for
positive or negitive post about DVD.

  I am sure some of DVD's friends have saw your post and have informed him
of your complaint.

guys-

a small story, and perhaps info that you guys can use as well...

frustration:

I do a bunch of business on the net. Buying and selling parts and cars for
years now, domestically and internationally. i have not had any problems
until recently , and for just $38.50.

i had emailed, and sent money for 2 pre-58 type 2 license lenses close to 6
months ago to somebody known as DVD on thesamba. there was a little
communication via email in the beginning, and then nothing in the mail,  I
had to hassle to get any kind of communication after feeling like nothing
was going to happen...

&quot;its coming, i'll send you one next week, this and that&quot;...then
nothing..still no lenses or a refund.

every now and then me sending emails reminding, asking, and left to
wonder...with the ad still on thesamba.( as of a week ago or so)

someone had mentioned that he had not had any trouble with David at swap
meets, and was curious about this story of mine...

I hate to use the forum, and i don't bad mouth anybody, but this instance is
beyond being patient, and forgiving of time, other responsibilites of the
seller, i am more than flexible, and understanding, but again there really
is not an excuse... to ship a small package from cali to VA, its really that
hard??

has anybody else had issues with this individual? no phone numbers were ever
posted, just emails:
nosparts_at_hotmail_dot_com, nosparts.vw_at_verizon_dot_net...

thanks for listening
robert
56 DD panel...which still needs a license lens...
