&lt;&lt; - VIN 469869 (all three tags match i.e. the screw on one in the engine
 compartment, the stamped one by the engine and the one behind the seat)
 - Engine number 3047914 (with cast generator stand... so it's a 36 hp 
right?)&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Correct it is a 36 HP built for a type 1 shortly before JULY59.

 &lt;&lt;- Also it appears to be a split case transmission (i.e. there are bolts 
holding the two halves together).&gt;&gt;
What is the tranny ID number?   Eric&amp;Barb
