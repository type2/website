Subject: Ah, sweet blessed event

Volks,

Monday I took the day off and put My Sweet Bus on the road legally, and
then yesterday put some insurance on her.  I drove her to work today, .
. . all of six blocks, went to get a parking sticker and the x#_at_$%!
students had the parking office line out the door and up the street. 
Had to get a visitors hanger.  Wouldn't you know, it is raining.

Thanks to all you guys 'n gals who gave me advice while I was trying to
get her up to speed.  Still have a ton of stuff to do on her, but she is
now street legal, and on the road until the snow flies.
