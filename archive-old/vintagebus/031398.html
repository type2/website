Subject: Re: [VB] Score! jealous

OK, I'll chime in on this one.

A buddy of mine just scored a '61 Westy, for how much? I have no clue. But the best part is he couldn't bring it to
his house until he made room. How does this benefit me?? He *gave* me his running '65 DD, walk thru EZ camper. It
needs some body work on the drivers side. But that's about it. I'm going down to pick it up Sunday. I'm giving him
$300 and he's throwing in the tent as well...........
