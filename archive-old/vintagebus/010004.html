Well.....

Here's MY story on all this &quot;controversy&quot;.

My family and I posted our info to the AIRS site in case we could be of some
assistance to an air-cooled VW person in difficulty  -  ANY air-cooled VW
person.  We don't give a rip if a BEM shows up or phones using his middle
tentacle to dial.  If he/she/it/whatever has a problem and we can assist in
any way, that's fine with us.  To do less would be sailing under false
colors.

I'm glad Shawn called us for help, and very sorry we couldn't provide more
concrete assistance.  I hope we hear from him again with a report on his
journey back to Spokane in the wilds of Eastern Washington, just so we know
he's OK.  But if we never hear from him again we certainly won't feel that
we've been &quot;used&quot; by some unworthy &quot;outsider&quot;.

Perhaps it's a Pacific Northwest thing, a quaint artifact of our relatively
recent emergence from &quot;last frontier&quot; status.  But out here, when you tell
folks the latchstring is always out you really MEAN the latchstring is
always out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When the AIRS site first went up I expressed my concern that it be
access limited. This is exactly why. So perhaps this is a well meaning guy
who would be interested in helping others in turn. But maybe not. Neato
doesnt publish the travel directory to non members and I dont think this
should be either. Opinions? &lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt; Absolutely I have an opinion!

This is exactly why AIRS exists. This gentleman may or may not join AIRS and
reciprocate. I for one want to risk it. My suspicion is that the percentage
of people who get help and return it in kind will be high. Besides if I am
the giver of the assistance, I often do not know if the other party does
return in kind and I still go away with that wonderful feeling.

I will always be available regardless. &lt;&lt;
