Subject: leaky safaris-a practical suggestion
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 Funny? yes but what else can you do to stop these from leaking? a couple of
 tubes of silicone would do it but then you wouldn't be able to open these
 &quot;Safaris&quot;. There is no proper way to seal them, even factory ones.

Hi 
my solution is to roll up a small towel and leave it on the dash. rubber band 
it into a roll and hook the rubber band over the safari hold down latch. you 
can wring it out the window when soaked- or get the passenger to.    I 
dislike the rain pouring on my stereo 8 track player.   I did remove the 
drivers side safari and install a solid glass, so it does not drip into my 
shoes.   I only open the pass side anyway. so now it only leaks on the right 
hand side.

my NOS seals got old and drip in the rain.  used to only have a small drip in 
heavy downpour.  Perhaps I'll check out some other seals- any good 
suggestions?

however, all the other seals are older than I am and dry,cracked and surely 
leak as well.

soon to have the 61 back on the road again- safari leaks and all. tranny is 
in situ. So this is why I am thinking about new safari seals.  Then again I 
could put a solid windsheild in and reinstall the safaris in summer.  

ps is any one interested in a pic of the original style safari windsheild 
hinge mount plate?  THat thingy with the threaded holes in it the safari 
attaches to?  which is above the upper window ledge- in the body.
