&gt; How much does it cost to run the list for a month. Maybe I

Chris, et al...

First, this doesnt need to be posted to the list.  Send it to the people
that run it.  Thats why no one replied the last time you and others asked.

Second, Thom doesnt pay for the list.  The lists fees are paid for by
donations sent in by list members when the coffers get low.  Both the
type2 and the vintage bus lists share this server, and donations are used
equally.

Should the donations not cover our monthly fee, H. Steven Dolan pays the
bill.  He volunteered to pay it after we had so much trouble finding
another free colocation.

If you want to know more, there are all sorts of calls for donations in
the archives  (http://vw.i405_dot_com).  To find out where to send your
donations, or for an inquery on the status of the coffes, email steve at
dworkin_at_type2_dot_com.


And, just so you'll all stop asking, we are paying the meager sum of 100
dolalrs a month for colocation on a (now) fractional T3.  We just moved
the server from a full T1 that was provided by NAP that had tremendous
latency problems. (We being the hosting ISP...Digital-Galaxy.Net)


that answer your questions?
