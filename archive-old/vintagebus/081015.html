&gt;That should be due to a bad ground at the gauges.  Because of this the
&gt;dashlights use the senders as a ground instead causing the gauge misreadings.
&gt;Eric&amp;Barb


and

&gt;Your power source for the gauages is in the dash and you have a voltage drop.
&gt;
&gt;Run the headlights power all the way back to the battery. Also 
&gt;consider upgrading the main power lead to the dash to a larger wire.

see, this is EXACTLY why i am building an accessory harness, which 
includes wiring for a later H4 upgrade. i have one tentative taker on 
my 'need two other bussers to go in on wire' quest; if i get two 
definites, we 3 would get 33 ft of a 7-wire bundle - 1 8g, 2 10g and 
4 14g - for about $1/ft, delivered. WAAAY cheaper than anything 
except fishing thru a scrapyard.
