Subject: Re: [VB] Melted Coil!

My 66 Deluxe drove great 15miles on the way
&gt;home.  Saturday went to start him and just got a click (have a brand new
&gt;battery).  Looked at the engine and black plastic lookin like wax is melted
&gt;all over my fuel filter and fan shroud.  What could cause a coil to melt.
&gt;Was it just faulty.  My bus is coverted to 12v... could it be a 6v coil.
&gt;Hoping I can get my cash back a my a new coil and have some change.  Can
&gt;this happen again with a new coil.  My plug wires are brand new.


Did you leave the key on?  Coils get pretty hot of you leave the power on
to them without the engine running.  Was your battery also dead when you
found the melted coil?
