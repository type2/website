&lt;&lt;I dont know about you, I went to Indy once, big beer drinkin, littering

crosscut of america that did not impress me, maybe when i was a 

teenager, but not now. Anyways whilz i was workin on my 10 window

(greenhouse), listenin to national public radio emanating from within

the fine acoustic properties of an oversize tin of luncheon meat, These

properties only exist when bus is parked, engine off :&gt;) Seems there

was quite a riot out in Reno this weekend with over 100 arrests, i 

did chuckle thinking we will have a first hand report here on the list.

In any case A Hot August night sounds like a cross between A Street

car named Desire and Missisippi Burning...maybe i am Gettin old  :&gt;)

to take one's beloved bus with the danger of it being turned over by a rock

and bottle throwing crowd fighting the police??&gt;&gt;





No, I don't have any first hand report of the riots to give you.  I was asleep
by the time they happened, and not anywhere near the spot.

I left when the crowds started to get a little out of hand.  There were too
many people running into the streets and most of them drunken teens.  The news
reported that out of town gang members started the trouble.

All in all, the weekend was for classic and hot rod car lovers.  Most of the
attendees brought family with them.  I enjoyed seeing the older cars that have
been customized and rebuilt to be functional and driven.  A lot of the cars
are from California, and I noticed many of them have been upgraded with air
conditioning.  Many of these folks drive their cars.  I did see a few trailers
around, but  most build them to drive.  I met a couple who drove their '57
Chevy all the way from Chicago.

On Sunday, most of the people I talked to were not even aware of the riots, or
of any problems at all.  I think if you go looking for trouble you will find
it.  Common sense told me when it was time to leave.

I was only there to work, and doubt I would make the trip out just to attend.
I prefer a much quieter weekend spent somewhere in the mountains in my Westy.
