Subject: Westy tent wanted
Message-ID: &lt;37F79815.8F3BF221_at_bitstream_dot_net&gt;

OUCH! I just found that my near perfect condition tent suffered terrible
mildew while in storage. Hopefully it can be repaired, there several
spots where the fabric rotted through. It's an awful feeling....

Are there any late model tents available for my 67 westy? Mine is the
blue and yellow with the striped door that fits on the free standing
frame.

Otherwise, anyone know of someplace that does good repair?

Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis

67 Westy
56 SC (for sale)
