As I recall, cars weren't required to have seat belts in the early
60's.  My 67 Beetle had seat belts and I think that was the first
year.  I don't recall seeing any seat belts in 66's.  But I could be
wrong.  After all it's been 35 years since I bought the Beetle.

&gt;I've just picked up a '64 Sundial camper and am itching to do some
&gt;traveling.  However, concerns for the family's safety does need to 
&gt;take
&gt;priority.  I've searched the archives and found limited info on the 
&gt;possible
&gt;options for installing rear seatbelts.  I can't seem to locate any 
&gt;plastic
&gt;plugs or other such things that might indicate a mounting point for 
&gt;the
&gt;belts. Navigating the belts around the fold out cot also seems to 
&gt;present a
&gt;problem.  The open roads are a callin', but I can't answer until I 
&gt;can belt
&gt;in the kids!  Any help is appreciated.
