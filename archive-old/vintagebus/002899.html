Subject: RE: RE: Help! 36 hp Judson Supercharger

The stiffer fuel pump diaphram spring provided with the Judson kits was supposed to increase the pumping capacity of the pump for the larger demand by the engine. There was also jets provided with the kits- an air correction jet ( would this have been a larger or smaller jet?) and a main jet(probably larger to make more fuel available).
