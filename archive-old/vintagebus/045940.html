&lt;&lt; Anyway, I was wondering how common it is &amp;
 if it was worth anything much.  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
About $6-10.00 and they are a little uncommon to find, but not rare.  Make
sure that if you use one that it is made of aluminuim and not steel.  Plus
only use the stock knob.  Too much extra wieght on the top of the stick shift
will cause it to lean against the shift forks in the tranny and wear them out
prematurely.   Eric &amp; Barb
