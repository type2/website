Well, I'm getting closer to actually being able to paint.  I think if
I can stay my present course, I'll be ready for paint in about 2 weeks.

I've had a few suggestions - thanks folx - but still haven't nailed it.

The scheme in my head right now is bright yellow, with maybe a contrasting
color on the beltline, with a bubblehead-type logo, and my web URL.

Thoughts?

Thom
