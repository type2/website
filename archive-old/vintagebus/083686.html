Subject: Re: [T2] painting a bus w/ a pattern

just a thought jason but try doing a search for web backgrounds see if you can find a better pattern ....?
heres and example

http://images.google_dot_com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.ekholmit.fi/FImg/cannabis.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ekholmit.fi/FImg/full.htm&amp;h=75&amp;w=75&amp;sz=6&amp;tbnid=STyWhbH9MocJ:&amp;tbnh=68&amp;tbnw=68&amp;hl=en&amp;start=18&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dcannabis%2Bbackground%2Bimages%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26rls%3DRNWE,RNWE:2005-15,RNWE:en%26sa%3DG
 
hope that link works if not go to google and search for background images..(make sure and click images so thats what it searchs for .... it will pull up just pics that away). its the backdrops that are used for most web pages you can find some good patterns that aways sometimes..
 sounds like a great idea dont forget to take pics .....
peace and love
chris

So I've been thinking of ways to let everyone know how insane I am. I
already drive a bus everyday and enjoy it. But it lacks something,
perhaps a paint job? yes, yes......that's it. I shall paint my bus!

So anyway, as my family are huge Auburn fans we have just about
decided to paint it in a tiger stripe theme. I'm going to use either a
base/clear coat or just single stage urethane, but that's not really
the concern yet. I'm trying to come up with a good way to mask off the
stripes well. One idea I came up with is to take a picture of a tiger
stripe pattern and use a slide projector to shine it on the bus when
masking off to give me a guide line, does anyone have any additional
input or suggestions? I have also had quite a time trying to find a
good tiger stripe pattern online. Does anyone know of a good digital
pattern of a tiger stripe? TIA.
