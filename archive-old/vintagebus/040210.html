Subject: I got a 25/early30horse Crank for sale NOS
Date: Mon, 7 Feb 2000 10:02:43 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey all,

	I got this really cool NOS VW Exchange 25bhp/early 30bhp crank and
bearings.

	I am assuming that this is the motor used in Barndoors?

	It has been reground (.25mm) and reconditioned by VW Exchange
service.

	This was an Ebay Purchase of mine that I didn't fully investigate.
I was looking to get a nice NOS german 1600 Crank and not this early, early
type.

	The whole thing is cool 'cuz it's all wrapped in VW boxes and the
crank is still coated in cosmoline.  It even has a VW set number... 113 198
351X.

	Alas I do not own a barndoor as of yet let alone a 25hp motor, and
I'm just looking to recapture the $$ I have into it.  I am asking the $125
it cost me plus shipping.

	Please contact me P-mail if you have any interest what-so-ever...I
can even send a picture of it.... I am willing to bargain and trade if
neccessary...
