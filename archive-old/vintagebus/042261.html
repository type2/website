Sorry about that.

Yet another glitch in the free-to-us-while-i-work-on-the-new-server
~points to it~ dsl line we are plugged into left us offline for the past
many hours, with a few spits and sputters before that.

HOPEFULLY, we've seen the last of it..but since the provider wont admit to
any problems, i suspect it might happen again.

I'ma workin to get the new server to the point where I'm ready to send it
cross country...soon. :)
