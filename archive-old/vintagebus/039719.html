I'm pretty sure Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries some magnets (or 
stickers?) that you can put on your bus.  I think they showed a picture of a 
white beetle covered in the things.
Also, my friend works at an automotive sticker shop...you know, the place 
where all the hipsters go to get those Chinese letters that they stick all 
over their Eclipses.  He told me that they can basically do any sticker you 
want.  They can scan it, enlarge it, and print the baby out.  Maybe there's 
something like that in your area?

&gt;So where do Jamie Rivers and others find these monster stick-on 
&gt;probable-cause power-flowers as at the bottom right of
&gt;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/evb2001.html?  I'm looking for similar 
&gt;items for my '65 standard.
