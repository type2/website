Thom is correct...the late westys use a completely different flooring
material then the early say pre`65 westys did...they used a fiber board
type of flooring, not plywood...Its been years since I owned my last `65
and up westy, I know just have oldies...but I can call my buddy who
bought my `66 Dormo so-44 from me and have him take a look...it was all
original.

&gt;From what I recall the stuff in the `65-`67 westys mimiced the the
flooring in the `68-`73 westys, if not being completely identical.

&gt; We could be talking about two entirely types of stuff though; the pieces I
&gt; pulled out, while delaminated, were not really that thick.  I had to make
&gt; slots to get the bolts down to the seat mounts.

&gt; Probably not much point in comparing mine to a &quot;late model&quot; :)

&gt; &gt;on the steel floor if I remember correctly.
