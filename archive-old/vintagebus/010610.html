Subject: Re: [VB] Update on 63 singlecab, Bedslats &amp; Radio

Harry, thanks for looking.
Clara &amp; I went to Germany this June and I looked at a 63 firetruck in the 
Wolfsburg museum.

I went back to my photo_album/webpage as above and you can see three pictures 
of this red 63 firetruck. I did take a close-up of the pop-rivet head. This 
link is still active but may not be for long.

My website on NBCI is going to vaporize so I am finding a new one, but with a 
digital camera you can built up 100s of megs of pictures, especially when you 
have 100 megs of memory in flash card in the camera!

Somewhere I read that they changed from pop-rivets to screws in some year but 
I do not know which.

Anyway thanks for the idea, and keep on truckin'
