was writ:

However. If you have an engine going with this bus, it seems to me that it 
would be easy to determine if it was good or not. This seems like something 
you SHOULD disclose.

ya, well, I suppose theoretically he could install it and run it, or ground 
start it, but maybe he is  wanting a bus to go away and doesn't want to put 
more work into it. 

 Seems the real issue is the high bidder ofthe ebay auction is reneging on 
the deal, so what now?   Anyone want to buy his 15 window?   It is very clear 
the motor is not installed, the bus is not a runner, in case you want to know.

what year is this bus again?  I heard it was a buletnose 61, but heard the 
pics shows fried eggs and later taillight?  VIN?  colour ?  location?
