&lt;&lt; A 200mm clutch plate/disk will work with a 180mm flywheel?  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
No that will not work.  You can use a 180mm flywheel that is either 6 or 12
volt with 180 mm disc and pressure plate, or a 200mm flywheel that is 6 or 12
volt with a 200mm disc and pressure plate.  While you could use a 180 clutch
disc with a 200mm flywheel and pressure plate it would be a waste of parts and
your time.    Eric &amp; Barb
