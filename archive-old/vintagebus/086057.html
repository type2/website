Subject: Re: [VB] At least I'm not that crazy...

Hi Conrad,
There is a HUGE differance between crazy and just plain stupid....   ;-)
  If that bus sells for anywhere near that price we should go into  selling 
new shoes with 3&quot; sawed off the toe end and sell them for ten times  the new 
price.  All because they are &quot;Unique&quot; and &quot;Talk of the  block&quot; kind of shoes.
