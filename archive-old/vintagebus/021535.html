I have a 70 westy with the 1600 SP engine. I used to time it at idle to TDC 
but found it somewhat sluggish &amp; it overheated a little. By advancing it I 
get more power and it runs cooler.
I notice that when I rev the engine it does advance somewhat but I have not 
vacuum advance.
I guess that I should go check my distributor numbers but I am happy with the 
way it is currently set.
