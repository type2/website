A while back there was someone looking to get a bus from Seattle to Phoenix,
I also need to get some stuff from Seattle to Phoenix area, I have 3 middle
and a couple of rear seats that I would like to put on the transport or in
the back of the double cab if possible, if not is anyone coming to Kelly
Park from Seattle ( cascade kombi folks) that would be willing to haul 1 or
more for me?????????????????? I really need the middle and a back for my
deluxe and this is the last number in the equassion. Please contact me by
p-mail if you or anyone are willing to help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
