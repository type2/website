&gt;&lt;&lt; let me know if this looks like a switch off a set of
&gt; early 60's (judging by the screw terminals) ambulance fans.. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Michael,
&gt;No it is not.  It probably is an add on switch for pre-WWII autos to install 
&gt;later signals.  We have an interesting collection of German printed auto 
&gt;mechanic magazines that show this in an article and our info is from what we 
&gt;can figure from the pictures.  Anyone know if there are really good German
to 
&gt;English translation software out there yet?   Eric&amp;Barb
