Subject: seat positions

Hey all,
I'm going to be picking up some middle seats soon, and I don't want them
to get beat around in the back of the truck...or up on the roof rack...
so I decided I'd take the bus and clamp them down as they were intended
to be.  Thing is...there are 2 seats.. and I only want to make one
trip.  If I take out the rear seat, can I put in a middle seat in its
place?  Will it fit ok?
This is in a 62 bus...and the seats are all splitty seats..

Isaiah
