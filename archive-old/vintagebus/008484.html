Thank you, I have this book, I will reference the drawing.

&gt;
sorry to hear you feel that way we were only trying to find out more
information on this air cleaner and thought we have kept the dialog civil.
If you want to Email us the part you found demeaning we would be happy to
disscuss it with you.
&gt;
There was not a particular portion, it was the general tone of the entire
message, I got a feeling of a tone of &quot;oh, yeah?  Prove it!&quot; rather than &quot;We
would like more information.&quot;

After a few people emailed me in your defense and I reread the note a few
times with their comments in mind, I was able to see it in the manner in
which you undoubtably meant it.  I retract my comments - they may have been
hasty.

Thanks,
