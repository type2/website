Subject: Re: [VB] 200,000 mile motor

&gt;My friend Jeff had his stock from factory 1600 single port go 200,000 miles
&gt;in a 69 bus. No rebuild. Would have lasted longer if he knew how to drive a
&gt;bus when he got it. Drove it like a bat out of heck. Way to fast on freeway.
&gt;Most mileage by PO was from Issaquah to Cali, hence freeway miles.
&gt;
&gt;Dylan rebuilt his own engine to a 1641 and got 300,000 with mostly in town
&gt;miles.
