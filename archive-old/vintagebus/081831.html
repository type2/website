Subject: The Four Corners campout?

There were some interests of a Four Corners campout back at BBB so I am now 
soliciting.

Location: the Monument Valley.

Time: shooting for sometime in May. Unless people just want to get out and 
go, then the last weekend of Feburary. Friday to Sunday.

Year of vehicle not a concern. Just drive out and camp.

Who wants to go and shoot the breeze. (I imagine if Feburary we'd be shooting 
the snowdrifts. But Chris from Vegas seems dying to get out.)

Ricky
