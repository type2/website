ROTFL!  That's a great project idea: The SamBar.  I've always wanted to make a chair from a B*etle front or rear end.

In the other direction, there's a DC in a field that I pass regularly, about 1/4 mile from the road.  &quot;Doesn't look too bad from here.&quot;  Gazed at it for 
years en passant and finally hunted up the property owner to take a look.  It's definitely in 1/4-mile condition: nose has been replaced with *plywood* 
(cut for lights in the proper places) and the windshields were plexiglass.  &lt;shudder&gt;  More like a fossil than an actual vehicle.
