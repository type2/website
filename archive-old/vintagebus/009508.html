&gt; are the old shoes scraped from the drum beaing pulled off against them?
No, I don't think it was the brake shoes... but then I can't see any reason
for it not coming off easily, so I dunno.  The outer bearing is definitely
toast.  The inner one looks ok though.

&gt; &gt;  ===============
&gt; remove the nasty soaked shoes, you need a new set.

So.. I don't mean to sound dense, but the shoes don't look soaked.  I think
this has been an ongoing slow leak, there wasn't any actual liquid (brake
fluid), more like an accumulation of dampness and crud.  So ya, the shoes
have some of this black crud on them in a couple places... Do I need to
replace them?

&gt; remove the piston from the wheel cylinders on that side (I put an oil pan
&gt; under neath to catch the drips)   take a rag and a flashlight and look
inside
&gt; the cylinder.  okay, wipe the old fluid out so you can see better.  The
&gt; cylinder should be nice and smooth- no pits./   Pits are bad.  if they are
&gt; very slight you may be able to use a brake hone and rebuild the wheel
&gt; cylinders, but if they are more than very slight you will need to buy new

I can't see any sign of pits or grooves.  So I'm wondering about this
rebuild kit idea.  Is this a VW-specific part or something generic?  The
VWflaps in my area don't seem to carry them, at least they don't show up on
the websites. (bow-wow and Cal Imports)  What does it contain exactly?  Is
it just new rubber rings?  I'm just wondering so I don't sound like a total
idiot when I call around on Monday... the parts places around here generally
have staff that knows zero except for how to work the computer, so it can be
kind of frustrating.

Thanks again,
Diana
