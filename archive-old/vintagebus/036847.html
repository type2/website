yes well, I know you know al of what I am going to write, and I knew it too, 
just neat to be reminded.

Cause  I was futzing with my 65 westy today, and put new points in it, and 
suddenly it ran smoother.  pretty nifty huh?   it was a really dramatic 
difference.   much more than usual.     Though I think it is running too 
lean, and I'll change the air correction jet to 125 from 135, cause the plugs 
had that light colored buildup on them.     

 it  was in the mid or upper 60s probably when I was tuning it up, and I was 
sitting on my milk crate behind the bus watching the motor, and ice was 
forming on the manifold under the carb.   When I did the motor switch I had 
left the pre heat tube off, as some stuff is different, air cleaner on other 
side etc, then got the other rear tin on there , but not the metal pre heat 
attachment.   it's warm, and of course, not dry, but a cloudy warm day, and 
the carb is icing.   hm    Scientific fact- it does not have to be 40 F to 
carb ice, it can be in the 60s.    I found the tube, and installed that puppy 
toute suite.

after this, it was nicer to drive the bus today.   :)  
Clara
