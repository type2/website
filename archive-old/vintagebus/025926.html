hi all,

I have been surfing around today, as the boss man is out sick, and have
noticed a half dozen or so Sapphire 1 radios out there.  While some of
them look similar a couple don't.  Is there a reference anywhere that
would tell me what I should have both in my 65 and in my 59.

Now I know that a few different companies made the Sapphire series, but
how do I know which ones i need and which ones will even fit.

Thanks,
Aaron
