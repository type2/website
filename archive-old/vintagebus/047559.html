Hi Jim,
A lightened FW is kind of like having a hammer made from styrofoam.  You can 
move it up and down quite fast, but you will not have the mass in it to push 
as much with it.  The stock wieght FW is a mass battery to keep the engine 
turning disspite the compression of the P&amp;Cs.  With a lightened FW you can 
RPM up the engine faster to shave off fractions of a second in a quater mile, 
but it will not have enough mass to keep the engine turning over at idle and 
low RPM.  Thusly these engines with lightened FW have to be revved up to keep 
running when stopped at a light.  Also the stock wieght FW mass helps out to 
smooth vibrations of the engine.
  As for the best source for a CW crank Gene Berg is best for quality, but is 
a bit pricey.  We are trading for three brand new CW cranks from Butch in San 
Diego at Bear VW Machine, but have no real info on these cranks except there 
has been no problems so far with the engines Butch has put together with 
these crankshafts.  We were hoping to make it to Sacramento International 
Raceway, for the Memorial weekend VW meet at the end of this May.  Where we 
were going to connect up with Butch.  Unfortunitly it looks like we will not 
make it there this time.  Is anybody from the PNW going who could bring us up 
these crankshafts from there?
Thanks,   Eric&amp;Barb
