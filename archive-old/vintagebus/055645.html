Subject: Small Wonder - great book to read

Whoa - I just finished reading that book.  I'm sure most listees have =
read it, but I recently found it at a used book store and, until then, I =
was completely unaware of it.  I is an amazingly well written book - at =
least in terms of keeping a reader interested in the history of a =
corporation and in the people who made it work.  I must say I was =
unaware of the pivotal role Hitler played in early VW and in the role of =
German Americans.  Great Book - I'd even recommend it to les if he can =
get away from CNN (joke les).
