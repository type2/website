Subject: middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repop

 A few month back I picked up a full length middle seat for my bus, but
since then have come to learn that a walk through should of had a 3/4 seat,
is this really true? my bus has the extra key ways in the floor for a full
length seat but they are screwed in brackets not welded on ones.


If that is the case does any one have a 62-63 3/4 middle seat they would
like to trade for a full length middle seat?


Also my seat if from a standard not a deluxe. I was wondering if anyone had
the chrome pieces for the grab bar they would be willing to sell / loan me?
I have been doing custom goldsmithing for over 10 years now and would like
to make molds off of the chrome pieces so I can cast them in brass and then
have them chrome plated.
