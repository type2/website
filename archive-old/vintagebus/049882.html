Subject: Re: [VB] Finding GL4

Enlightenment at last!

From: http://redlineoil_dot_com/gearoil.htm (there is a wealth of lubricant
info on this site)





&quot;GEAR AND SYNCHRONIZER WEAR PROTECTION

Most manufacturers of manual transmissions and transaxles recommend an 80W
or 90W GL-4 lubricant.  GL-5 gears oils which are required in hypoid
differentials are not used in most synchromesh transmissions because the
chemicals used to provide the extreme pressure protection can be corrosive
to synchronizers, which are commonly made of brass or bronze.  Typically,
the use of a GL-5 lubricant in a synchromesh transmission will shorten the
synchronizer life by one half.  The extreme pressure requirements of spur
gears and helical gears found in transmissions are not nearly as great as
found in rear-wheel drive differentials. A GL-4 lubricant provides adequate
protection for most manual transmissions, unless a unique design
consideration requires the extra protection of a GL-5. &quot;




Now the dilemma:  GL5 oils protect helical gearsets (like a vw ring and
pinion) better than GL4 oils, but the additives used in GL5 oils can
corrode brass syncros.  It's a compromise.  It seems like syncros are
almost alway shot before the ring and pinion in a VW tranny.

The ideal (perfectionist) solution?  SEPARATE the diff from the tranny!
Somehow seal off the differential chamber from the transmission chamber,
within the transaxel housing.  They already have separate drain plugs, so
only one additional fill plug would be needed.  The GL5 oil will benefit
the diff and rear axel bearings.  Am I getting too crazy here?
