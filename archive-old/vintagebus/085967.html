Subject: Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts mid season run

Howdy all. Had an uprising of demand on the Samba, so I'm printing up a
midseason run, hopefully in time for Christmas, of the fireman's edition
of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts.
http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/1357795.jpg
Anyway, since the very first shirts I ever sold were on the Vanagon_at_lenti
list, and others that followed, I figured I'd offer them up once again
here as well.
It is a limited time offer, so please act quickly.
Here are a few points to clarify:
This print run is ONLY for the white &amp; silver design, with crossed
wrenches in the center. It can be printed on any color shirt, but of
course darker colors look a lot better.
If you want a red &amp; black on gray print, they are in stock &amp; ready to ship
now, but are only available with FRONT printing, in short sleeves.
Likewise Red &amp; Black stickers are in stock ready to go.
DEADLINE:
orders must be received by Friday, November 10th. period.

SIZES- I can get all the way down to children's Medium, so ladies should
also be able to get a good-fitting size. Likewise, I can go up to XXXL.

COST is $20.00 per short sleeve shirt, which INCLUDES shipping.
Long Sleeves are $25 (including shipping)
Sweatshirts are $30 (including shipping)
these are high quality 100% cotton shirts made to last.
Stickers: $2.00 each, 3 for $5.00, will deal for large quantities.
TO ORDER:
Paypal would be great - please send to
rapalmer at ncsu dot edu
SPECIFY SIZE, COLOR, BACK or FRONT PRINT, SLEEVE LENGTH

If you don't have paypal, and need to send a money order, please send me
an email telling me so, and then please make sure you actually do send it.
OK, thanks y'all, a pleasure serving the Air-Cooled public.
Thanks,
