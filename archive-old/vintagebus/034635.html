&lt;&lt; Why don't folks just rechrome or repaint an original?
  &gt;&gt;
Some of us (okay I can only speak for myself) do.  I had a very nice painted
emblem chromed.  In fact they did such a good job that it's even heavier than
the stock chromed emblem.  The thing is though I trade parts for my chroming.
I spend no cash out of pocket--ya-like I have cash in my pocket.  So I have no
idea what chroming costs.  I am just lucky enough to have a friend with a very
large lunch box that works at a chrome shop!
    Peace, Love, and ya oughta see the wiper arms he did for me..WOW!!
