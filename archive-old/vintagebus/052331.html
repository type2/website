Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panel
	s

  The outer framing pieces from Schofield are just square boxed pieces that
could be made in a metal brake by any body. They are not close to original,
but would work in a pinch. I have imported and tried all of his sheetmetal
and some is great and some is marginal. Kelly (aka metalwiz) makes a lot of
the pieces that are much better then Schofields as far as fit and original
shapes. 
  If you are looking for sheetmetal Kelly (aka metalwiz) would be the man to
contact as he has used about everything repoed  out there and makes the
stuff that he can't find of good quality. He would be more then happy to
sell you what he makes and refer you to whoever else has the parts he likes.

As far as the stuff being made in Michigan, it will be distributed out of
Phoenix only (I've been told) and I have tried to get Kelly set up as the
eastern distributor but politics seem to block that outlet for the time
being.

Subject: [VB] Re: Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels


I'm interested in two of the replacement cargo door bottom framing pieces
(not the outer skin),which Alan shows as part #10 in his early Type 2
diagram and listing. I haven't seen them listed anywhere else. Please let me
know the price and details by direct e-mail.

Given the recent discussion about quality shortcomings in some replacement
sheet metal parts, does anyone have favorable or unfavorable experience with
Alan's pieces?

&gt; I'll be importing at least one shipment of panels from Mr. Schofield in
&gt; England, and if it works out, I'll be the new US importer.  If anyone
wants
&gt; something, drop me a line, and I'll make sure it gets included.
&gt; If you want to see what's available, you can check out Alan's site at
&gt; www_dot_ahschofield_dot_co_dot_uk.
