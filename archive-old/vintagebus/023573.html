 I have to disagree Thom.  A collector, IMHO, is not going to see a scanned 
 copy as devaluing the original in the same way that replicars or posters of 
 the Masters art works do not devalue the original. ...
 The scanning of out of print material for VWs is, I feel, a sharing of 
 knowledge that should have no impact the market value of the original from 
 which it is made.  Course, some children just don't want to share with 
 others.  Call the Yard Duty!!!
  &gt;&gt;
I cheerfully disagree.  part of the value is the original book, but though I 
think the original books are great, and love to have what I can,   I am 
really really more interested in the information.   Consider the bentley 
reprint of the original book.  If a person wants the info, you can buy the 
bentley for use.   there is a lot of people like that.    I have photocopies 
of some books, so I am much less likely to spend big chunks of a real copy, 
as I have the info.  So the market for the originals is smaller if the info 
is available otherwhere.
