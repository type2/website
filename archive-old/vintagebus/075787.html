&gt; Give the
&gt; bus an oil change even if it's early, drive it easy, sounds like nothing's
&gt; too major.  Do a tea leaf reading on the oil, watch oil drain for inconsistant

&gt; couple degrees often reduces backfiring.

Gonna do all of the above Tues, prolly also back the timing down from 32
(new setting rec. by listee) to about 30. It was 27. Also will check the
main jet size in new carb, and prolly also rip off that sides rocker and
check torque on lower nuts.

&gt; I recently replaced the oil temp guage in my 65 that read from 150 F to 300F
&gt; for one that went from 40C to 120C.  ( ~115F to 250F)   I can watch the bus
&gt; warm up now.   easier to read temps.   300?  hey, if it's above 250F it's
&gt; already too dern hot, so why bother with the next 50 degreesF?

I like that idea! ;-)
