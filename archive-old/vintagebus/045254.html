I put a thermostat on the motor of my 65 westy when it was out, and I have
actually noticed a difference.  

The heat gets warmer a lot quicker.  By the time I get to the traffic light
(about a mile) the bus is cosy (it is in the 50s around here now).     So the
engine warms up quicker, which I expected.   The other thing is that although
I drove it for half an hour last week, the thermostat had not expended, which
opens the vanes in the fan housing.   Hmmmm

what does that mean?   That the engine had not gotten hot enough to want the
air to blow directly ove rthe cylinders.   I had tested the thermostat itself
before installing it by dunking it in boiling water, and it dutifuly expanded,
and closed up a short while after removal.     

The thermostat keeps the engine running closer to the optimal temperature.  

 Usually when you think of a VW, you think of keeping it running cool.  But
you don't want it too cool, either.    It is less lubrication and more wear
and whatever else.   In the winter things are different than in the summer.  I
drove this bus/motor up to the airport one day (about a year ago) to pick
someone up, and checked the motor when I got there (an hour and a half on the
freeway)- and I could leave my hand on it indefinately.  That is too cold.
I don't have a working temp guage, just an oil pressure guage, so I can't give
a quantified difference, but I am very pleased that I did this, and it had an
effect I did not expect.

So, assembled those themostat pieces, and put the set up in your motor next
time it is out.     

I hope I got all this right.  there may be a part two, especially considering
the way things have been going recently
