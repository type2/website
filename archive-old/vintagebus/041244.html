Wow! I've got one of these that has the original, working speaker and an antenna out of a bus. Is it really worth $100? It won't fit in my '64 or the '65 I'm about to get, so I don't see much future for it in my life.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;advertised in the Volkswagen Archive I found a working 12v '67 Saphire V
...
&gt;He is in UT and is asking $100.
