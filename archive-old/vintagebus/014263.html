THIS is the guy that SCREWED me out of the title for my 1966 panel van that
he SWORE up and down it was a 62 or 63, yet had the LARGE back hatch......so
he AINT a VW person. I can send anyone the copies of all his replies to me
and then quit answering my emails when I started asking for his help to get
a correct title. He had a title, but NOT the correct one, so he was driving
the panel van illegaly. He SAID he didnt know where the VIN numbers were
located since it didnt have the plate.
