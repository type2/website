&gt; &lt;&lt; I picked up an old 6volt starter today for a spare and was 
&gt; wondering how 
&gt; hard they are to rebuild. I mean can I do this or should I take it 
&gt; out to 
&gt; have it done? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Shawn,
&gt; For the average VW owner it really is not possible to rebuild a 
&gt; starter or 
&gt; generator without spending alot on specialized tools.  

Dear Eric &amp; Barb

A press and a good sized screwdriver bit if i recollect rightly.
A friend of mine makes money on the side rebuilding alt.,
starters and generators for a specialized clientele were it is 
economically feasible. (heavy equipment) However for 
most of the list vee dubbers it's best to test a starter &amp; if it 
doesn't  work, buy  a quality rebuilt or convert to 12v....

However (IMHO) there is an argument for DIY rebuilds.

Think about our whole hobby / obsession / kuliana.
(sorry for the Hawaiian) Why do we ride around in or hold 
dear such and * unusual * form of transportation?
Splits are an iconoclastic ( is there such a word?) symbol
of the alternative. While that is a funky factor in this rant,
let us put aside all the history and hippie karma of a bus.

Splits are a most of all utilitarian; in their purpose and 
* serviceability *. If you offered me an old Ferrari rather than
my split for my  crossing of the continental US last year, 
I'd have to say no. Not just because of parts availably,
but because My kombi is the least intimidating thing 
I've ever put a wrench on. Maybe It's from my wishing it.

I have a confession to make,  I picked the splity over a 
loaf because I could push the bus off of a dropped engine
by myself during an engine pull. ( as apposed to the
bumper getting in the way on a loaf or bug. ) I feel like
a quitter if I give over the repair or understanding of a 
part or assembly to another person. God knows I didn't
learn how to be a mechanic in HS Auto shop, I was way 
to much of a boggerhead in those days, I went to busted 
knuckle vw university to lean that stuff.

My VW's * are * a learning experience. I am willing to do all 
it takes to learn all i can from that experience. 
Then my generator went away the last time, 
I checked It out with my friend the re builder 
and discussed the feasibility of rebuilding it.
If It was a 6v rather than a 12v, I may have done it.
When I put in the 40 horse tin on the kombi I'll look at the 
6v generator with the same eye...
now that I know more what to look for.

Then there is the whole zen thing. (be the bus, be the bus...)

Laters!

Ken
