I'd say 75 to 110 busses attended.  Nothing to speak of at the swap except to stand back and watch all the regular vultures descend on every new swap arrival....great fun!  I especially love the guy with the mustache who is never shy about running around looking for things and then brings them back to plop them down at his space for twice the price...ah you gotta love free enterprise ;-)

Rennie (who I met for the first time) his lady and the weenie dog were around taking photos of listees busses as were Matt and Katie.  You didn't miss much other than the same old regulars.  I did see 6 sets of org. safari windows (sans glass) for sale....one of them sold.  I think they were above $600 a set...not sure though. No extra parts though :-(

I have to admit I bought a tee shirt only because it had a great pic of a pearl white DC on the back.  Commercial busses and trucks were &quot;featured&quot; so I got directed to &quot;this must be the front row!&quot; to park.  Big whoop ;-}

Better than going out to breakfast with the mother in law which I'd of had to do if I didn’t go.

Steve

How was it? Did Dave Heard get to feed a lot of animals?
Swap, show, friends of the bus, what did I miss?  I hate missing shows.

ronnie

ps, a lot of conversation on clamps, but still no answer on how many of what
it takes to bolt a middle seat down.

pss, the large wing nuts are avaiable (OEM) I will get some in for those
that want them.
