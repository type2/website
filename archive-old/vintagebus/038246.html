&lt;&lt;I am looking for a set of curtain rods, and possibly curtains, for my '55
westy. It came with one, and I have holes for all the others.&gt;&gt;
 
Hi Thom,
Dawn and I can hook you up with the proper curtains for your '55. We have a
very similar yellow fabric as the 1964 and earlier Westys.
 
Hmm... finding the rods will be a bit trickier, especially if you want
splitty ones. The 70's Westfalias used the same curtain rod stock as the
splitty Westys except they are twice as long. If you can't find splitty ones
just go to the junkyard and strip all the curtain rods out of any 70's
Westy. Bend the long rods the same as the splitty rods and hack off the bits
that are left over. Remember the rods are not straight on splitty Westys.
They have an &quot;S&quot; bend in the middle of the rod for the curtains to overlap.
Also for the bottom curtain &quot;bungy&quot;, we just went to the hardware store to
buy the braided 3/16 - 1/4 inch &quot;bungy&quot; cord. The only colors they had in
that size were green, black, and red. You may find different colors.
