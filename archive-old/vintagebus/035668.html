Looks a lot like a old bus that's been sitting.  Not too bad though.   I 
would say that rocker rot and front floor rot is the kind of rust fopund 
often in the PNW due to water leaking in through old window seals.  But the 
bus is pretty straight, and the rust isn't structural, replacement panels are 
available.  Has more parts on it than I would expect though.  Believe that 
bus came with a 36hp motor, hence the crank apron.  Does it have a split case 
tranny?  I think early 59 with split case trannys and sturdy bumpers are 
awesome. This bus is savable.  Pass it on to a good home if you dont want to 
bother.

PS my 65 westy had much worse rocker rot, and has worse front floor holes.

 It's a shame it's rotted so much at the rockers and down low. It's 
 pretty cool otherwise. I'm not sure I've got it in me to repair this 
 one. It may get parted out.

 Let me know what you think.
