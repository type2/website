Assuming you can't find a pair of armadillos (I know they're
endangered, but surely someone is still making them), I've had
reasonable luck using heavy rubbery-plastic hose with a helical wire
stiffener in it.  Got the stuff at a car parts place, but I have no
idea what it's official purpose in life is (it certainly doesn't look
like it was intended for handling liquids).  Get good hose clamps to
go with it (and a sharp knife, if you don't already have one).
