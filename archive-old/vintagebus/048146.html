Biggest I can think of, even surpassing what Ty Hodges stated
it &quot;could&quot; run, would be the potential liability should that part
fail.   My concern would be if you did have some sort of
catastrophic failure and persons and/or property was damaged,
would your regular run of the mill car insurance cover it?

I have thought of some sort of interchangeable gears with
different ratios that could be swapped around depending on
the owner's needs.  My vision would be a simple slip fit with
some sort of splines for the gears to slide onto and a snap
ring to secure it on the shaft.  Eric (of Eric and Barb fame)
pointed out a few flaws in this grand scheme with regard to
what I mentioned in paragraph #1.

Plug for Eric here~  I had him repair some damaged/stripped
reduction gear housings for me and got them back today.
Considering what the original condition was, I think that I got
a heck of a deal for drilling out 4 broken off rusty bolts from
below the surface, 5 HD extra-long Timeserts, and drilling/tapping
the remaining bolt holes to the longer length.  I don't know if he
is set up for, or wants to do, this kind of work on a regular basis
but I'd recommend his work based on what I see sitting out on
my workbench!

PS- I 'might' be able to duplicate Eric's expertise but I'm so busy
slinging transaxles around that I just didn't have the time!
