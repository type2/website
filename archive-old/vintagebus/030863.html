Ah...not to freak you out Gene, but have you taken a look at all the warnings on
a bag of silica blasting sand lately??  I just bought 3 bags, so I just noticed.

I think spent fuel rods would carry a lesser health warning.  The free floating
airborne silica that is a byproduct of blasting is a known carcinogen as well as
the cause of silicosis of the lungs.  Best to try and blow from the front with
compressed air and hook shop vacs to the heater tubes and see if that helps.
Unfortunately, you'll have to pull the motor.  :-(

Either that or wear a respirator while you have your heater on.

Steve
