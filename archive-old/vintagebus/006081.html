I thought it would be worthy to post that I'm really glad to see the list
back up and running.  What I really liked is the updates that Thom sent out
to us all personally to keep us informed on what was going on.  I do believe
that out of the lists I've been on, this is a first - it was really
comforting to know all about the outtage.  Many thanks to Thom and whoever
else was involved in getting this back online - it's truly a treasured
resource in my book.  Because several of my emails bounced, I'm going to
post them to the list again - updates on my 67 bus resurrection.  The engine
is almost ready to reinstall (hoping for today.)

I've also suggested to Thom that he post the amount of money that was
involved in getting this list up and running so that we can donate a little
bit to help out.  I missed the list bad enough that I'm willing more than
ever to pitch in a little bit to help defray the costs - I think we owe it
to the volks in charge.
