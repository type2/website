Once again I need your help with my shifting problems. Here goes:

Bus won't shift into reverse, 3rd and 4th. Allways. Nothing there, just
as if I tried to shift into 5th gear.

Last weekend, I crawled uder while a friend was moving the shifter.
There seemed to be some slack in the shift linkage (where 2 rod meets
near the tranny). Me helping the rod to turn just a little more made
shifting possible, almost easy. Worked for reverse 3r and 4th. 
- - - - - 
before assuming the worst, try the easy stuff.

that coupler just forward of the tranny- if you lie under the bus while a 
friend wiggles the shift stick around, is there any slop between the tranny 
hockey stick and the shift rod to the front of the bus?  If tightening the 
screws doesnt help, if the wiggle if from the coupler itself, replace the 
couple.

if that doesn't clear it up, take off the shift stick (2 13mm bolts unde rthe 
floor mat) and make sur ethe guide plate it correctly positioned----- unless 
it used to shift properly but I have the impression you haven't driven this 
bus yet, right?   the reverse wiggle should be forward to the right- kitty 
corner from where you put the bus in reverse.

hope this helps

Clara
