In a message dated 98-07-31 01:44:27 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I have been interested in buying an early split window bus and I have come
 across a 63' double door.  ( I think that is what you call them.  Cargo doors
 on both driver and passenger side)   I am intrigued over the extra set of
 doors on the drivers side.  Can someone tell me how rare this is?  &gt;&gt;
Hi,
To find a double door panel is not too common, as for a 1963 model it is even
harder so it is unusual.  If you had found a walk thru it would have been very
unusual.  It sounds like you have found a $500-1,500 VW depending on how much
or less of the mechanicals are still there.  So if you really like it, buy it,
and if you really want a truck, westie or other instead.  Then turn somebody
else on to this panel so they can save it.   Happy VWing, Eric &amp; Barb
