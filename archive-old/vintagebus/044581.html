Daniel,

When we are talking passenger side are we talking LHS or RHS ?
Being in AUS my bus is RHD.
The front interior is stripped bare except for the steering wheel and
handbrake - still no M-plate
Thanks.  Daniel

so- on the forward side of the bulkhead where the front seats rest.  look for
a 2&quot;x3&quot; plate held in by 2 little screws.   there is either a plate, the place
the plate was but has been removed from, or the body number stamped in (this
last on most 50s buses).  You can only see it if the seat is out of the way.
