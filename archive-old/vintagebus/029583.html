Unfortunately on both cases you'll have to obtain a birth certificate
from the Stiftung Auto Museum to find out the M-codes. On the Double cab
it would have been on the Bulkhead (the division between the seats), and
the 55 would not have M-codes anywhere on the bus.
The VIN number from the engine compartment plate will give you the
correct number to go by. Cory

&gt; Hey guys and gals! My newly aquired DC (63) has had the division between the
&gt; seats hacked out of it. How would I go about finding the mcodes on this
&gt; truck? Also where would they be on a 55 SC(if it has them)? Thanks alot!
