I did this awhile ago in my 65.  I used a dremel tool with a wire brush attachment to clean all the connections, even thefuse box!  The metal looked brand new after a few passes with the dremel.  I am still having a problem with my light switch though.  It get's very hot, the big red wire (30?) get too hot to touch at the
light switch end.  Somebody told me I probably have resistance in the switch itself.  Has anyone out there ever done a relay bypass for there light switch?  I have the idea to run new wires for my headlamps and have the power go through a realy rather than the 35 y/o light switch.  I also wanted to run the ground as a wire
all the way to the battery.  Any comments, suggestions, bitches would be appreciated.
