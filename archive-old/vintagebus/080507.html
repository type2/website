I think it was a 71 bus part, to go with the 71 bus gen (38A)  maybe used on 
some bugs too, not sure.. there seem to be lots of those plates around, and i 
think it takes a different hub where the fan goes as well, and of course, the 
special 38A gen pulley. with different offset.

Is the dished plate a doghouse part?  Does it use a different fan 
(etc.) too?  I'd love to get this taken care of while the engine is 
out.
