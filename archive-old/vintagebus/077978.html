Subject: Re: [T2] Re: SW Heater wiring help

&gt; whats the concensus about hooking one of these up when you buy one used?
&gt; what do you look for? how do you make sure its in operating condition? im
&gt; assuming the thing can be a time bomb of unknown history... it would worry
&gt; me.

Bob, I know you're concerned, but believe me, I've seen a lot of VW engines
catch fire, but since I started working on gas heaters in the early 70's,
I've yet to see one that was ever on fire.  I've heard people say they knew
someone who's brothers friends cousins boss had one on fire, but no body has
every produced one for me to see.

Checking out an old heater is just like checking out an old engine, you just
need the right manuals and a little time to do the job right.  Nice thing
about these heaters, they aren't huge and don't take up much space.  But I
won't kid you, it does take some time to do the job right, you can expect to
spend most of weekend if you completely restore one.

I do carry a number of parts for the SouthWinds along with factory manuals
and flexable exhaust pipe.  My site is at:
