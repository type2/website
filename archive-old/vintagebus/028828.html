Guys:
I'm 6' 31/2&quot; and I slide pretty easily behind the wheel in my 66 walkthrough.
I tried sitting in a friend's non-walkthrough and I was pretty cramped.
I find that positioning my left foot like dworkin suggested is the best way to
go.
My bus is also equipped with seat belts that have shoulder straps. Every so
often
I have to loosen the belt because the position the belt keeps me in doesn't let
me &quot;lean&quot;
over the steering wheel the way I like to.
Even so, I have to stop every three hours or so on long trips because the pain
in my left
knee gets pretty intense. But by then I'm out of gas and snacks anyway.
Besides, it seems like everytime I stop somebody wants to tell me some story
about
the bus/bug/friend-who-used-to-have-one/and that's one of the things I like
best about
my bus.
Isaiah; you've seen me at DBG meetings so you know what I'm talking about.
John

or ten minutes.
