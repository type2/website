Subject: RE: [VB] Brake &amp; Shift(Minor) issue??

I have had old brake shoes break apart so that there are pieces of the
shoe loose in the drum.  This will be obvious when you take off the
drum, of course.  Another possibility is a bent backing plate.  You
should be able to see shiny wear spots if this is the case.

Could be your clutch is too loose.  I'd tighten it up before replacing
the tranny.

You asked --  Question is what do I look for when I pull the wheel?
Maybe a
show dragging?  Slipped off of the retainer?  rock in the shoe?

Also the tranny seems to slip into 1st and 2nd better when the engine is
slightly revved above idle.  Clutch need further adjusting?
