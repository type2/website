&lt;&lt; I notice that the castings are cracked on almost all of the edges, the 
cracks going quite deep into the metal. Is this a result of age or an 
original casting fault? Are these things useable? The cracks look quite bad, 
though the various parts all seem to be holding together. &gt;&gt;
Hi Christian,
Sounds bad to us unless you enjoy oil leaks.  Since you bought them so cheap 
you probably can use the internal pieces expecially the diaphram to rebuild 
German fuel pumps and still come out smelling like a rose!

&lt;&lt;Another thing about these pumps is that they are covered by a plastic 
shroud, looks like a heat shield. The shield is held on by a wire circlip 
round the base of the pump. I notice on a used Pierburg that it has the same 
channel for the circlip. Is this a heat shield against the dreaded 40hp 
vapour lock, and were Pierburgs originally fitted with them?&gt;&gt;
Sounds like the type 3 pancake engine type of fuel pumps!
