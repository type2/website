Hi Eric and Barb,
  Finally got around to putting the time-serts (30mm) in the Redux boxes.  
The kit comes with a 5 inserts, drill bit, counterbore, tap, and driver.  The 
drill and counterbore are 3/8 square shank.  I bought a tap driver from Sears 
and it has a 3/8 square shank on the other end of the tap.  I do not have a 
drill that will take a 3/8 square shank, and I don't have friends that have 
one either. The tech at time-serts said a drill was not necessary and to 
drill, counterbore, tap and insert in by hand with a good driver.  I followed 
the instructions and it cut cleanly with the proper amount of cutting oil and 
elbow grease.

  I measured it and it appeared that the 30mm inserts would just fit 
(remember, I did not use a power drill to make it deeper) I found it 
difficult to use the square to get the hole in perpendicular to the plane on 
the spring plate bolt on surface and just trusted that what looked good was 
so.  When inserting the time-sert, I did not notice the point in which it 
gets harder to drive in, then easier.

  I got the 30mm time-sert almost all the way in, but it will not go the last 
1/8th inch with the driver and tap driver.  I now have a problem.  I can 
think of a few solutions: call time-sert and explain the problem, use a easy 
out and start all over again, counterbore the outboard side of the spring 
plate to accomodate the 1/8 inch protrusion, put a bolt in there and see if I 
can torque the remaining protrusion down with a cheater bar.  
What do you say?       Best, Joe   67 camper&gt;&gt;

Hi Joe,
CAREFULLY use an Easyout to remove the insert.  If it does not remove easily 
drill it out and clean out the remains.  You can buy 31/64&quot; drill bits with 
turned down shanks at specialty shops or hardware stores or have you drill 
bit turned down at a local machine shop that does small jobs.  Though we 
suggest just buying a low speed drill with a 1/2&quot; chuck.  We just bought 
another vintage one for $25.00 at a drive in swap meet and bought a new chuck 
key for it at our FLHWS.
  Then drill the hole deeper with a 1/8-1/4&quot; drill bit then use the 31/64&quot; 
drill bit with drill motor or drill the hole with the biggest drill bit you 
have for a 3/8&quot; chuck and then drill by hand with the 31/64&quot; drill bit.  When 
ever drilling anything over 1/2&quot; it is alot easier to first drill with a 
small bit and then the bigger drill bit does not have so much back pressure 
from it's larger cutting center tip.
  Bet you just did not drill the hole deep enough for the tap to full form 
threads all the way down and the insert hit these and stopped before seating 
all the way down.
