Anyone know the function of the other two wires running to the wiper motor.  
Is 31b ( I believed that's the lettering on the switch), the brown wire on the

Brown/tan is ground.  This is an Euro automotive standard!
As for the other terminals, one should be low speed, the next high speed and 
the last is a constantly on to allow the wipers to park.
