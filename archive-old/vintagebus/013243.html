&gt; Hey, I was wondering if anyone knew anything about putting a 36hp nut on a
&gt; 1600 single port and trying to crankstart it? would there be too much
&gt; torque? would it snap back and break your arm? :) I am goin to put a 1600
&gt; single port in my 57 and would still like to retain a somewhat stock look of
&gt; the crankstart and etc. lemme know if anyone has seen this done or knows

DOne it.  I have this setup on my '56.  It takes a little more work to crank
it than a 36hp does, but it works.
