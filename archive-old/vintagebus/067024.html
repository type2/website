Hey Y'all, Happy 2003 &amp; Happy Friday! It's time to start planning all your bus
events for the coming camping season. DEFINITELY put this one on your
calendar, it's the Third Annual VW Buses, Boats, and Bands Bash. The event is
held just north of Cincinnati, Ohio May 16-18, 2003.  The weekend will feature
Camping, Live Music, Canoeing on the Little Miami River, and of course the
World Famous Full Moon Bus Club Burritos. Here is a link to the event web
