I, for one, really want original parts for the resto on my 59 double cab
which means, 'find a set of original safaris if you want the d*mn things'!
So, I ended up hunting down two sets to make one... and now spending the
time to restore them.  To me, if you're going through the trouble to restore
a vehicle, what's the point in trying to save a few hundred bucks.

Asinine you say... I dunno....

In the end, if it feels good, DO IT!
