All we here are generalizations. You can't go around and just spout out
any old comment with out some form of knowledge about the statement
you're making. You don't know what is in his head. From what I overheard
he seemed pretty knowlegble about what he wanted and not just some
tirekicker. Just because he's famous and has money doesn't mean he's not
human and doesn't lives like the rest of us. You don't know what he's
going to do in his life so don't assume.

&gt;  I drive my bus to
&gt; work. I use my bus. I love my bus. I really don't care if Eddie gets a bus,
&gt; but I would like to know  why he wants a bus. I can't see him really enjoying
&gt; his bus like some of us do. Is he gonna move furniture with it? Will he run
&gt; errands with it. Will he get it dirty going camping? The whole concept of bus
&gt; is alien to alot of people.
