&lt;&lt; The PO had J-tubes and some missing tin, so now I'm listing all the items I
need to address to maximize the chances of actual interior heat. The things I
have listed so far are: new heater boxes (w/levers, etc), engine seal, full
set of tin, and new hood seal, and fresh air hoses. Am I covering all my bases
here? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Well it is that itme of the year for those of us in the northern hemisphere to
ponder the heating of our VWs and the farther north the more important this
is.  One of the things we have found out is that the &quot;new&quot; heater boxes being
produced today are not your best buy.  To understand this problem you have to
go back and look at the earlier heater systems.  The 25, 36, and 40HP engines
until 10 DEC 62 used a stale air heating system that closed off the entire
cooling system of the engine from going out the rear of the VW to go into the
VW instead.  Thus if you have a oil leak you can really smell it.  Then on 10
DEC 62 the first fresh air heat exchanger system was intruduced.  Which
enclosed the exaust tubes from #3 &amp; #1 away from the rest of the engine.  Then
in 1 AUG 63 VW increased the size of the outlet of the heat exchanger and to
increase the heat exchange they molded fins not only on the outside of the
exaust tubes, but on the inside of the heater tubes.  Which you can see if you
look into a exaust end of the heat exchanger with a flash light.  Previously
the exaust tubes had a round shape inside and the only improvement between 10
DEC 62 and 1 AUG 63 was to cast aluminuim finned around the exaust tubes and
the fresh air conversion.  This 1964 production heaters with internal finning
increased the heating during the winter by 1/3-1/2 and increased cooling of
the VW engine during the summer when the heater is off due to the double valve
design of the heater boxes.  Which cools the heater tubes and reduces the back
pressure against the heads in warm to hot weather.  
  The problem is that the &quot;new&quot; heater boxes being produced in Denmark are 10
DEC 62 to 1 AUG 63 insides without the internal fins.  While the outside sheet
metal is the 1 AUG 63 type with large outlet snout.  The best heater boxes we
have been able to find so far are the original ones produced from 1 AUG 63 on
up with the internal fins.  In other words fix your old heater boxes or find
original ones and enjoy both better heating of your interior and better
cooling of your engine in summer.
