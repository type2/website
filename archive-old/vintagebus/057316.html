Subject: stolen bug/westy parts in trends

jon got an email from a friend in pennsylvania asking if the 1967 beetle and westy parts reported as stolen in the june issue of vw trends was our stuff.  we rushed out to the local bookstore to see.  sure enough, there on page 8 is a picture of my little buddy and a write up containing the bare facts, url to p&amp;c's webpage, phone number for the police and my email address.

wow, we didn't even ask for publicity and we don't even know who is responsible.  i'm still not sure how to feel about it.  i'm appreciative of the advertisement and i hope that there might be a better chance of getting my beetle back but on the other hand i want everyone who's lost a vw to get equal exposure.

i sure wish that we could have gotten into the magazines a better way, that's for sure.   a better way would have been more like that really nice single cab in the issue.

cheers,
