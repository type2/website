Subject: Re: [VB] Re: steering wheel colors

 Hello-

Not every commercial came with a black wheel. I have
seen many Westfalia's (kombi's) that have white wheels
from the factory. Namely my 65!

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, deluxes were pearl white (but not
&gt; necessarily) and deliveries
&gt; were black. I have never seen any other original
&gt; colors. Not sure if
&gt; interior color dictated wheel color.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe someone else on the list knows.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was told that black steering wheels belonged to
&gt; commercial vans, that
&gt; &gt; sounds right. But did all Deluxes come ONLY with
&gt; ivory wheels? What
&gt; &gt; about gray wheels - were they were pickups?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How do you know what the correct color was for
&gt; your bus? Should a
&gt; &gt; certain interior color dictate what color wheel
&gt; you got?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Where there any other colors? I thought I saw a
&gt; cocoa color one once.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Conrad
