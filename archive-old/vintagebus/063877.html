Clara, List

It's like putting an inner tube on a rectangular wheel, only you pinch the
tube together with the two pieces and you cut the tube so it goes around the
corners.
Lay the tube flat on the long side of the flap. Cross section looks like O but
you flatten it so it's more II.  Cut the ends square and about two inches long
on each side. Do the same for the other long side. Then cut the short sides to
look like \====/ so they'll tuck into the over hang of the long tubes. Guess
you'll have to slit the inside of the long squared off ends so the side
mitered edges will fit in. I used spring clamps and a vise to hold everything
together while pop-riveting. Use a nail to poke a hole in the two rubber
layers so the pop-rivet will push through. The curve of the bike tube is good
for the top of the flap, stretch the lower so it's straighter. No problem if
the rubber is bigger than the original pieces, it all flexes when it closes in
the tunnel. Hope this helps!


p.s. Use a non-heavy duty tube, you want a uniform thickness, not the thick
and thin type.

p.p.s. Listen to the Arlo Guthrie recording of Alice's Restaurant. The only
Thanksgiving &quot;Carol&quot;!

  Good idea, think I have a bicycle inner tube around...  I like cheap
  solutions to fixing the bus, and then I could get it done this weekend!!!!!
  But I don't quite visulize how this works.

   I mean, around the flap that opens/closes the vent  are you doubling it
over?
  If not, the tube is curved so which way does the curve go?
  Sorry if these are dunb questions
