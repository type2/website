&lt;&lt; Question:  Are these all the same bumpers, suppliers buying from the same 
 source, or is one definitely superior to the rest?  Any others I missed? &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Pretty darned sure they come from the same place.  The repros are made from a 
thinner sheet metal.  But more importantly the welds that hold the nut plates 
inside the bumper blade and uprights are just a spot here and there instead 
of the factory bead of welds.  Making them more likely to pop apart when hit!
