&lt;&lt; I've veen looking at vinyl graphics for the logoing on my panel, 
 primarily for ease of creation, (they can cut it from an image file),
 ease of application, and ease of potential removal.  
 
 Any second opinions on the subject?  This would be a combo of
 image and text, although not necessarily on the same segment,
 if that makes a difference.

I think the vinyl is too &quot;today&quot; looking. You need to find one of those old 
timer sign painters that know the sign art of the 50's-60's and paint a retro 
look sign on the panel.  there's nothing like the old school approach to 
commerical signage.
