Two part, or catalyzed paints are basically resins.   They chemically cure and
should be hard enough to sand and buff with in a day or so.  In fact, I've been
told that you should do your sanding and initial buffing while the paint is
relatively &quot;soft&quot; or the blasted stuff is almost too hard to  sand.  You can do
it, the effort is just greater.
