Nope!  The G terminal goes to the sender wire. The guage is grounded thru
the mounting hardware (ideally). The &quot;+&quot; terminal goes to +12V (or +6V as
the case may be).

I have been told that the guages and senders are not system-voltage
dependent, ie, they would work in either voltage.  I do not know that for
sure, just have heard.

I would caution against applying any voltage to the sender wire which goes
back to the tank. Doesn't seem safe to me to have voltage and current
inside the tank.
