Hi John,
&lt;&lt; You mentioned that to ID a 2:1 pulley just look for a D stamped
 into it on the rear facing out?&gt;&gt;
Yes, if you have one of the pulleys that has those pie shaped reinforcing
dimples on its flat radial surface on the rear side.
 &lt;&lt;BTW don't you have 215s on your bus?  What type of pump to you carry to
 change them so you can deflate them.  I'm thinking maybe even a manual pump
 to get it up enough to make it to the nearest air?  I know you used to be
 able to buy some kind of foot pumps at some of the home stores. &gt;&gt;
Well at first both of our rear wheel wells were cut out by DPO.  Have since
then welded one back in and found the problem that it causes in the rear with
tires over 205/75R15 size.  So yes we deflate that side and reinflate when
bolted on.  We have used both foot pump and one of those no name eletrical 12
volt air pumps.  The thing is that the spare position in our 1960 walk thru
panel camper is in the rear left corner of the bus and the widest that will
fit in there is 165SR15 which we use for a spare to get to the next town for
repair or replacement of the tire that went flat and it fits without needing
deflating.  Even if your spare position is behind your front seat/s tires
bigger than 165SR15 may not fit in some early years and even the years that
will allow a wider spare will only allow up to 205/74R15.
