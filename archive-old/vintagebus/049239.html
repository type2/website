Our neighbors brought over 4 packets of converstational heart candy. These say &quot;VW.COM&quot;, &quot;MY VW&quot;, &quot;LOVE MY VW&quot;, etc. Got'em from the dealer after their Jetta tune-up. 

Just raised the hoops on the '63 DC. Snapped off two 8mm bolts in the bed, but successfully drilled and tapped'em out. Nice working height. Will work on installing the slats tomorrow. They seem to be the original wood, chamfered at the ends. The PO marked their positions, so it should be an easy fit. 

Weather looks threatening, but may be cleared up by Sunday. It never rains in Southern California...
