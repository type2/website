Hook the reverse light wire to the positive side (power) not the
negative (distributor) side of the coil.Effectivly you are grounding out
the coil when you put it in reverse.

   On a side note, whenever I put my bus in reverse, it stalls out, even
if
I have the clutch fully depressed. It doesn't grind into reverse or
anything. It drives fine in all the other gears (except for fourth which
it pops out of, why I am replacing the tranny in the first place). What
could be the problem? Thanks again.
