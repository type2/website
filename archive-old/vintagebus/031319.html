&gt; The '60 DD is sitting in it's little costco shelter, napping.
&gt; I alternate between the DD and the 911 every now and then.

My '60 DC would be doing the same, but I had to take my shelter down.  Got an
email from my city that they were forming a committee to investigate the
&quot;proliferation of the temporary shelters&quot;.  One of their targets were
shelters that did not meet setback rules.

Since my shelter missed setback on one corner by 2 feet and with my recent
troubles with the city and my DC, I decided to do a preemptive strike and
take it down rather than replace the cover that had aged beyond use.

I need to lie low for a little while.

'60 DC
