&lt;&lt; Can anybody tell me how much and what kind of the damage would my engine

Hi Michael,
Running an engine too far in advance or anytime dentonating (Pinging) the top 
of the pistons are likely to have a hole to put through them.  Since your 
engine is running fine, you probably saved it by tuning it up.  Look to see 
if your distributor clamp is bolted down properly, and if the distributor is 
easliy turned still with the clamp tightened around the distributor you just 
might need a new good distributor clamp.  We have seen some new repro clamps 
that only touch the distributor in two small points instead of most the way 
around the distributor.  Less surface area touching less friction to keep the 
distributor from turning.  If the clamp is fine then check your points to see 
if they are readjusting themselfs or the shaft lobes the points are riding 
against is not rusty/crusty.  Might be wise to check your timing every 1,500 
miles at most till you solve your trouble.        Eric&amp;Barb
