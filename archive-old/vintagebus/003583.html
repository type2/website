Subject: Thermostats / heat flaps and such
Date: Fri, 27 Apr 2001 19:19:37 -0700

I have heard many stories about the heat flaps and Thermostats.

It would seem that many people feel different about them.
Some people remove them and say that they are not needed.
Some people think that if you remove the flaps then the air does not
circulate correctly over the jugs and prevents proper cooling.

Others seem to think that if you weld the flaps open that is ok and other
believe that if they do not function correct, the oil might not get hot
enough to be able to lubricate the engine right.  They say that the oil
stays with out them around 110-116 degrees.

So my question is... what is the real scoop on the subject?

Since my old engines did not have them, I would like to have those parts to
make them work.  I have searched most sites and can not find them.  Best I
can find is the thermostat alone.

Thoughts?
