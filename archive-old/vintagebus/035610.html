cool, better to do itthan not.  i think so at least.
.....
  i drove the distance with a truck whose starter crapped out (well actually 
it was dragging real bad) somewhere between home and my first gas stop.  i 
almost had it fixed but pressed on like an escapee.  nine push starts later, 
a disabled break light, no e-brake, no signals, a mysterious wheel lockup 
that fixed itself and a 50 mph trek across the desert in the middle of the 
day i made it to rancho vanbondo in phoenix.

do fix or get this stff fixed.  starters are pretty cheap, I go for the $50 
ONE FROM KRAGEN/SHMUCKs, you can exchange for another at any store in the 
country as long as you own the starter (btdt).   the locking wheel could be 
the brakes, may be a messed up hose or something like tat- an be very 
dangerous, may be the first step in a blown hose (BTDT, used the parking 
brake for 40miles, not fun, not terribly safe)( an you have no ebrake, you 
will be messed up)   catch up on that delayed maintenace.  Brake parts are 
cheaper than hospitals and paying for other cars to be fixed
.........
  i'd been on the road solo, driving and sleeping, for 24 hours.  i had 
probably three of four hours of sleep total and was undoubtedly pretty weird. 
 jim, paula and even audry were great hosts and unafraid of the californian 
loony.  the ellis clan, joe clark from florida, joe bier from new jersey and 
myself made it to jerome friday with !
only three push starts.
.............
glad you had a great trip!!!!
