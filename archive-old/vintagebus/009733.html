I have mixed emotions about this whole Alaska Highway trip thing.

Because I'm a fully indoctrinated VW bus type I would probably be piling
great heaps of parts and tools into our Westfalia before setting out on such
an epic journey.

Yet every one of several friends that have made this trip over nearly 4
decades, in all sorts of conveyances including old VW buses, never had a
problem that stopped them in their tracks for any length of time.  In early
years some had tire problems, but carried enough spares to keep them going,
and some lost lights and glass but pressed on regardless.

Six years ago my father-in-law and his wife made the journey without any
special preparation in a late-80s New Yorker [basically a pumped up K-car]
with 200K on the odometer.  Typically for them they just up and decided to
take another long trip, and within a couple of days headed out.  The car got
an oil change and a couple of new tires, and away they went.

They started from Banning CA, made a side trip to Kansas to see some
relatives, drove to Anchorage, and ended their journey in Tacoma WA.  Total
elapsed time:  ten [10] days.  They drove fast as usual, and returned with
many rolls of film exposed out the car window at ~80MPH.  They had
absolutely no car trouble, slept most nights in the car to avoid the expense
of lodgings, and returned complaining that they hadn't had time to do any
sight-seeing.  They were then in their mid-70s.

Right now a member of WetWesties is en route to Alaska in a
recently-acquired baywindow bus.  She has previously made the trip in a
splitty.  I doubt Susan expects any trouble because she keeps her Type 2s
well maintained but if there is a problem she'll deal with it just fine.

It's almost as if we have some kind of peculiar mindset that has us cringing
in fear of journeying in our VW buses that are, mechanically at least, as
well maintained as the vehicles of our fellow travelers.  They have no
qualms about heading off into the sunset/sunrise in their tired old sedans
or vans, dealing with any problems as they arise but probably arriving at
their destinations unscathed.

Is it machinery or mindset that makes the difference in our approach to
traveling?  Experience with some folks the past couple of years who drive
VWs long distances, but approach their campers as they would a typical US
vehicle, has me beginning to wonder.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  However, one should remember that the Alaska Highway is rather
well-travelled.  You're unlikely to be stranded for long.  The biggest
challenge is finding parts for your relatively rare vehicle.  With
telephones and UPS you really needn't worry about being stuck for more
than a few days in any case.  I don't think that I'd be any more concerned
about parts there than I would be on US50 in Nevada.  &lt;&lt;
