Eric-
I was looking for a little more umph also, but nothing *too* drastic or 
expensive.  So, I took my engine out last fall and did a top end on it 
last winter and just got it all in and have been driving it the past few 
days.  Its a 1600 dual port.  What I did with it was convert it to dual 
port (longer upper head studs).  I put on new dual port heads, honed the 
cylinders and stuck in new rings, used type 3 lower cylinder tin, 
converted to doghouse, used a doghouse fuel infected beetle fan shroud 
(velocity ring -- i hear it does good things), put on dual Weber 34 ICH 
carbs with hex bar linkage, used a 6V 200mm flywheel (12V system so it 
starts with a flick of the key -- seriously!!) but I like that bigger 
clutch...  I also put a header on it with a single quiet pack muffler. 
So far I like the setup.  It seems reliable yet powerful.  I can 
accelerate no problem if I want to, and have power up hills, but so far 
I see no sacrifice in reliability.  I stuck with the stock small nut 
tranny and it has *plenty* of get up and go.  I hop in my 71 and drive 
it (1600 SP with stock trans) and it feels pretty doggy compared to the 
62.  Oh yeah...I also run an early 009 distributor on the 62 with one of 
those clear-ish caps so I can see it spark at night :)
I do have a little exhaust leak on the left heater box to header 
connection as I had to use one of those one piece exhaust clamps that 
wraps around the exhaust pipe.  I *really* do not like those.  I'll take 
the 2 piece any day, I just have to scrounge one up.

I may not drive much faster due to the higher RPMs of a small nut 
tranny, but I'll have no problem with hills or headwinds, etc.  I do 
plan on going to a bigger tire than the current 165SR15 tire though, so 
that will help things out.  It was a long drive at 55mph to Missouri 
last year!

As for how long one of these engines will last?  I am really not sure. 
It runs smooth with 140lbs of compression in each of the cylinders give 
or take 5 lbs.  They're that close!  I don't know how I did that!  We'll 
see how they are after the rings break in...  The engine has 35 or so 
lbs of oil pressure too.  I forget how much exactly, but I know its a 
healthy number.  This engine had about 45,000 miles on it when I did the 
top end rebuild on it (I have the receipt for the engine thanks to the 
previous owner :) I expect it to last a good bit as it sounds and feels 
pretty dern nice.  Go anything bigger than 1600 or 1776 and reliability 
and engine life will drop off a good bit with the up side of more power 
from what I understand...although I do like Ronnie's single port 1776 
idea...

Well, to wrap this up (if any of it made sense or partially answered 
your question even) I am happy with my engine so far.  I plan on driving 
the bus to Arizona for the Jerome Jamboree in September, and also to 
BNNTA the weekend before which is on the way for this cheesehead.  I 
hope to anyways...I just got a job offer, so we'll see how it goes.

Does anyone have a roof mounted tent or know of someone with one for 
sale?  I would really like to have one of these as it would make my 
standard a real nice campin bus.  P-mail me if you know of anything. 
Have stuff to trade, or cash if that pushes your pedal...

But, one last thing.  BEFORE you upgrade your engine, make sure your 
brakes are in great shape and fully functional!  Its more important that 
you can stop fast than accelerate fast!


Enough mumbling for one night...
