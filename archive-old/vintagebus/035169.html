Subject: single cab wood strips
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    hey all ,
I still need the dimensions for the wood strips I have some white oak that I 
am wanting to try out but I need some measurements?

If some one knows how to get these measurements please try to direct them 
this way  . I am very anxious to attempt my own reproductions  in my wood 
shop.

thanks John
