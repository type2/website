Subject: Re: [VB] vintage ev bus

A better idea would be generators in a westy-style trailer, with cabling
up to the battery array in the bus.  You could disconnect the trailer
for short trips and run on battery alone.

&gt; All you need now is a hitch so you can pull a trailer
&gt; with a few good sized generators whose pulleys have
&gt; belts connected to the trailer wheel(s)or axle so you
&gt; can drive that bus anywhere!
