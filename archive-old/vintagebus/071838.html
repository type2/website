Subject: Help With Brakes Pulling Right

Gang,

My 56 Kombi is pulling hard right when I have to apply the brakes and was
looking for a little help about the issue.  I just replaced the brake pads,
wheel cylinders, and bleed the brakes.  I also made adjustments using the
star wheels.  However, I don't have enough driving experience with this van
to tell if it did it before I made these adjustments. Couple of questions:

1) If I don't have the brakes adjusted correctly would it pull right?  Seems
like it would and this is where the problem is.

2) When I adjusted the brakes there was always a spot the rubbed when I spun
the wheel around 360 degrees.  I assume the brake pads are not a perfect
circle and that this will wear down, I backed off one star drag click from
this point.  Will this &quot;rub&quot; cause me pulling issues until it wears down?
Any thoughts about where I left the brakes adjusted?

3) I bleed the brakes, however if I still had air between the master and the
slave would the Kombi pull because of this?  The Brake are nice and tight,
not soft at all.  Could I have air that would cause a pull and still have
tight brakes?

4) The Kombi naturally steers right (out of alignment) and the steering box
is sloppy.  Does applying the brakes just compound this effect causing the
van to pull right or should I be more interested in finding the problem in
the braking mechanism.

Any help would be appreciated.  

-Wayne
