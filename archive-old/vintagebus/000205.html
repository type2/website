It depends- 5 bucks- 50 buvcks? Complete with knobs, faceplate? Correct 
faceplate for the vehicle? It's probably worth somewhere between what you 
want for it and what the other guy wants to pay for it.It also varies with 
what part of the continent you're on. At the east coast shows there are quite 
a few people with cartons of radios with pretty high price tags on them, and 
at the same time they've had them for years. If it's a friend, a 12 pack of 
your favorite beer would be adequate.      Ed
