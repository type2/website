Yes, I go in every now and then and clean things up.  Until I come up
with better input validation, I'm preferring to err on the side of 
collecting the data and fixing later, rather than not collecting at
all.  If I implemented perfect input validation, I might discourage
people who would otherwise submit their buses.

&gt; It looks like the registry could use some cleaning up. Lots of busses that
