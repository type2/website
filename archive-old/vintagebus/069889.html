Subject: Re: [VB] car shows... i'm bummed

This is the way it's been at Puyallup for years.   It may have something to 
do with the fact that it's an inside show,  And they don't want people 
driving in/ out of the building, while the event is still on.   That place is 
a madhouse during set up/ take down times. 

  But I agree that  before 4pm I'm ready to head home.  I don't see why you 
couldn't drive into the grounds, without driving into the building, to get yr 
stuff out.  Maybe there are firecodes or something.   You might ask the 
NWVWClub.

I know that the Cascade Combis  (Vintage Meet) wanted to keep down the amount 
of people driving in/ out.  As there would be problems with people driving 
where there are loads of people walking.  

Don't California shows tend to open the gates at 7 am?  NW shows tend to 
start later than California shows.

 was ready to make my reservations when I found out the gates would be
 locked until 3 or 4 in the afternoon.. Now for someone in the general
 area, that isn't a problem but if you have to make a 6 hour trip back &gt;&gt;
