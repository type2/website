Subject: '67 Bus for parts in Chula Vista CA, junkyard
Date: Mon, 6 Jul 1998 11:34:20 -0700 

Hi all,

	I tried to post this when I was in San Diego, but it didn't get
through.

	Someone had e-mailed me awhile back about the possible location
of a bench seat divider.

	Well, when I was in San Diego...more specifically Chula Vista, I
ventured into the Ecology &quot;pick your part&quot; yard on Energy way and found
a '67 bus....Thoroughly stripped, but it still had the divider (with top
piece!!) and the front end with spindles.

	Everything else was pretty much gone.

	I tried to remove the divider, but they don't allow power tools
and my attempts with a hammer and chisel was going to slow (had to fly
out in two hours).

	So, as of last friday around noon, my repost on this bus and the
potential parts should be accurate.

	if you have any other questions about other possible parts that
were left on it, go ahead and  e-mail me off-list.  

	Good luck!!
