Subject: Got my birth certs! time to start cutting in the walkthru

I emailed my Credit card information to the VW museum exactly 3 weeks ago
and today my 2 birth certificates arrived. They charged my card $30.90. the
extra 90¢ was charged due to my request of &quot;an Mcode list and any addtional
information you could provide on my buses, I would be happy to pay for&quot;.  I
got a copy of their mcode list and also a listing of paint code
numbers,names and what upholstery was supposed to match it ( Commercial
stuff only, 1950-1964) Interesting to note that nowhere do they refer to
'dove blue' or duvblau, they only call it 'Taubenblau' (the whole list is
all in german btw). yet on my birth certificate they call it dove blue.

everything seems to be in order on my barndoor certificate except that it
says my panel has Mcode 083 which they say is &quot;walkthrough cab&quot;.. but my
bus is not a walkthru.
Looking at their Mcode list, they have 4 walkthru mcodes, 80,81,82,83.
80 is called out as being specific for a panel bus, walkthru.
My only guess is this list isnt early model specific and 83 meant something
else back in the day?

My bus also had snow tyres, Laminated front glass, and 018 and 086 not
identified.
heres a scan of the cert

My 57 SC cert has nothing special on it, Mcode 360 unidentified, USA
