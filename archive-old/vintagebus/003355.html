When the time comes for me to go to California, I'm going to punch in my
route on the AIRS site.  Then I will notify those along my route when I
might be arriving so they can expect me.  It's only courteous to notify
these airs members in advance if you might be in their area when at all
possible.  Also, airs stands for Aircooled Interstate RESCUE Squad.  What do
you think of when you think of RESCUE?  You think of saving someone in dire
need - an emergency.  There is no substitute for good planning, plenty of
spare parts, and lotsa cash.  If you are dirt poor and take off on a trip
with a junkyard find, you won't get much sympathy and help from me.  I'd be
more than glad to tell someone where the nearest VW shop is.  Now if someone
contacted me in advance, stopped by to visit, or called with a real
emergency,  (like a blown flywheel seal or shelled bearings), I'd be more
than glad to help as long as they paid for the parts, my labor would be
free.  Basically, I like to help people who are well prepared and had an
unfortunate circumstance develop.  It's those rickety old buses that haven't
been worked on since they were made, have 90 degrees of play in the wheel,
and left home on 3 cylinders that I find it hard to bring myself to assist.
Call me an ass but I wouldn't burden an AIRS member with problems that I had
control over before I left home.
