 Yeah, I had Ellie step on the pedal while I was under to see what happens at
 the arm. It pulled
 back like it should. Reached up and yanked on the cable and it feels solid.
 .............
hm, guess it's engine pull time
==================
 
  I would use this opportunity to replace the fuel
 &gt; line, change the tranny oil (including RGBoxes), install a new engine to
 body
 &gt; seal, replace the engine main seal and oil cooler seals,  or any other of
 &gt; those upkeep things which is a lot easier with the motor out.  If you
 hadn't
 &gt; already done them.
 
 One thing I need to do is move the throttle cable guide tube from the front
 of
 the shroud to the back where it is supposed to go. The po installed the
 motor
 with it in the wrong place so there was some cooling air leaking out of the
 shroud
 right into the carb. The thing is just kind of flopping around in there.
 I have some duct tape over the hole for now.
..............
that's annoying.  I Use a short piece of old fiuel line, cut a slit down it, 
and use that for grommets, like for the acc guide tube and the fuel line.  it 
is funny how often you find things like that being backwards on an old VW.  
ps it is really easy to adjust the valves and change spark plugs with the 
engine out.
 ============
 
 I was also going to install a battery strap and cover at the same time.
 All I ever see are 6v covers. Is there supposed to be a cover over the
 battery on a 67??
.................
good question.  I dont know.  In any case I have not seen a battery cover 
that fits the 6V battery in my 53, so I dont have one on it.   the 67 would 
have come with a battery strap at least.  If you dont have one, like the one 
in my 65 is rusted through, I use a short piece of 2&quot;x4&quot; in between the 
battery and the rear of the bus, just so the battery wont slide back and mash 
the taillight assembly, which may cause shorts.  the battery does wedge 
between the places the battery strap ends are, so that keeps it from going 
sideways.   A plastic battery tray is not a bad idea, to collect any stuff 
that might come off the battery, keep it from rusting out that metal under 
the battery.
