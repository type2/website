 Hi all,
 
 I was lucky enough to be given a complete and almost perfect set of original
 safaris off a '57 single cab. They were given to me, along with a pile of
 manuals by a long time friend who is selling his '58 standard. 
 
 Thanks to those that responded to my post requesting info, especially Jeff
 Grant who sent me pix of his safaris. I have no idea how to accurately
 determine the positions of the latches on the dash and on the windscreen
 pillars and I'm sure that to ninimise leaks and wind noise they have to
 close up accurately. Thom suggested getting an installation instruction
 sheet from one of the repro vendors but unfortunately I haven't had any luck
 there.
 
 Does anyone have a repro instruction sheet that they could scan and send me?
 
 TIA  
 
 Michael ( owner of what will soon be the breeziest doublecab in South Africa
 - I'm working on a dodgy homemade frameless rear safari hack too!)

have you checked you copy of the bentley reprint of the 1963 edition of the 
VW Transporter Workshop Manual- that big dark blue book?   SHould be in there.
