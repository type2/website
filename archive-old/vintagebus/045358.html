&lt;&lt;   on the subject here,   I have a 70 parts bus I'm hauling to the scrapper 
and was wondering if I should take the brake drums for use on my 67?  Will 
they work or is this a no-no ?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
The same brake shoes were used from 1964-67 so it probably is the same brake 
drums for both front and rear.  You might want to salvage the whole front 
suspension.  Just in case you or someone else wants, or needs to due to 
extreme link/king pin, or other wear, to use it in thier 1955-70 bus.  
Especially since one would need the 1968-70 suspension to mount disc brakes 
on 1955-67 bus.   Eric&amp;Barb
