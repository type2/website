Subject: Compressors and HP ratings

Hello all!

I managed to delete the message, but in the recent compressor thread
the issue of motor HP rating vs. current draw came up.  1 HP is defined
to be 746 watts.  In other words, a perfect motor would give you 1 HP
of power output for 746 watts of power input.  A real motor has losses
and will give you less.  If you want to figure it given the voltage
and amperage on the motor, multiply these two together to get wattage*,
and then divide by 746 - this will give you the maximum theoretical
horsepower you could get from that motor.  For example, a motor rated
at 120v, 8a is 120x8=960 W or 1.29 HP theoretical max.  You *will* get
less in practice.  There is a little more info at this link:

I hope this helps!

* For the EEs, I know this is not exactly right (a motor is not a
  purely resistive load), but I think it's close enough.
