&gt; My truck's vin says its production date is Jan '63 but the shoes that fit
&gt; are for trucks after like july '63, or so the shop says.  The front end
&gt; looks like it has grease built up on it since '63 so I would says its
&gt; original.  What's the story on these brakes?  

your truck has an i.r.s. rear end, correct?  i remember you saying something about type 3 or thing breaks?  in 1963 there was that one-ton option and maybe your truck's backing plates are them, if not one of the other mods?  no really, i *am* trying to help....  &lt;grin&gt;

cheers,
