Subject: Sand in Engine Compartment Followup
Date: Wed, 8 Jul 1998 05:54:05 -0700 

I managed to find the time to mess with the bus
and did a partial cleaning.  Not wanting to apply
degreaser and have the resulting muck wash
onto my gravel driveway, I used just plain ol' water.

I got in there with the spray nozzle and sprayed the 
(&amp;$%(&amp; out of the engine bay.  I'm amazed at how
much stuff (non-sand) got cleaned up just by using
water.  The engine bay looks really nice, the years
of accumulated stuff on the ceiling just rinsed off!

I reached way back and flowed water around the 
tank several times, back and forth, etc.  I removed
the rear apron to better reach and provide a place
for the sand to get out.  The right side is clean and
straight, while the left side has had some repairs
done to it.

I'll re-do the cleaning with degreaser after I get it
running and go to a u-do-it wash rack, since they
properly deal with the resulting goo.

I'm confident that I got enough sand out to be able
to work on the fuel pump and distributor without
getting any sand into the internals.

Today's topic is sand in the engine compartment.  The
PO had the bus sand blasted and didn't clean up well.

My first task was to remove battery to clean and charge.
Also to better start cleaning the leftover sand from the
engine bay.   I found a couple of inches in the little space
between the right fender and vertical piece ahead of the 
battery.  Still a bunch of sand held in place by the little
amount of oil on the engine.

The question is thus formulated:
What's the best way to get the sand out?

Pull the engine and manually clean or hose clean engine?
Then hose down the engine bay?
