hey all,
i got a small problem... we are having unseasonably warm weather here in 
Cleveland, Ohio and i wanted to take Tela for a spin last weekend. went over 
to the free heated garage where she is and started her up. first time she 
rumbled for about 5 seconds then quit. second time she did the same. (normal 
after a few weeks of not running) third time while rumbling over she 
completely died! NOTHING, no idiot lights when you turn the key, no head 
lights, brake lights, dash. the only thing that works are the hazards and 
the cabin lights???? i think its that damn starter relay cuz no power is 
getting back up front. anyone got any ideas? we got another few days of nice 
weather ;) shes a bone stock '66 converted to 12V.
thanks first!!
