Subject: more 59 truck wiring update
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Drove my truck around last night- got coffee, hung out down town, drinking too
much caffeine and thinking about my self (yes that was an Oly song)

wierdness:

with the headlights on the turn signals don't seem to blink for turning left,
but they do for turning right.   Work better with my foot on the gas (need to
clean up more groundsand connections I suppose)  yes, truck is 6V.  Yes the
generator puts out 7V.    
   
????

also, I really ought to adjust my headlights.  BTW, I added a light in the
engine compartment, for ease of nightime oil checking etc.  Used  a interior
dome type bulb holder, ran a hot wire direct to the battery, and screwed it in
where a PO had mounted a volatge regulator.

Drove truck to the scrap yard today to dump off misc metal that piled up at my
place.  It's really nice being able to pull down a sidegate and pull stuff out
at a good height where I don't need to bend to lift.

Anyway, the turn signals worked fine this morning, both right and left.

As for the screw on connectors:

Keep looking in different FLAPS and electrical supply
houses.  I found a momentary push button switch for
use as an in-engine-bay remote start switch that was a 
Euro style switch.  Large diameter install hole, threaded
connections, not push on spade connections.   Look for 
shops that cater to the flashy pop lowrider/cruising Euro look.
Look for Euro style stuff.

Sounds like a good Idea to check out such  sources for the screw connector to
connect too screw terminal type wires together.    I don't want to permanently
attach/solder the wires in case of future replacement of the turn signal
switch.
