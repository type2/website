I know this seems like something happened to set old Rick
off at CB Performance.  Maybe I did do something to push him postal,
but I am the customer, he already had my money from my account.

Anyone who remembers me from when I was on the list before knows,
anyone who has had anything to do with this bus knows money is not a 
deciding factor in building this bus. Money is NOT a deciding factor in
building this bus.

The difference in paying the tax OR shipping to Alabama and then
back to California was about $4, in favor of paying the tax. I spent more
than that in phone calls every day.

The man was rude, as a business man.  I would never treat a customer
in such a fashion, even if he deserved it.  In my view, maybe I'm wrong,
the customer is always right, even when he's wrong, he's always right.

The money has nothing to do with it.
