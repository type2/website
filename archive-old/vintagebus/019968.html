List:

I had to purchase a minimum order for the sisal rug found in SO-23's, and
I think Flip Seats as well.  The stuff I found is SUPER close to
original, greyish in color, nice small square pattern, etc.  I'm really
pleased with it.  Bottom line is I have some left over, I'm going to
guess enough for 3 or 4 extras.  If anyone is looking to replace their
worn, or missing, sisal rug, (Lou??) pmail.  The cost for a piece large
enough for the rug is $22.00 plus shipping.  If you'd like pics I can
send those too, but it will take a few days.

Robert
