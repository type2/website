Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

From: John Yust &lt;yust_at_icx_dot_net&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; When you get access to the net again, you can look at the archives and 
&gt; see a long thread on this a few months back. The short answer to your 
&gt; question is: Bigger piston diameter at the master cylinder means more 
&gt; pedal effort to stop the bus. The late model bus master cylinder means 
&gt; you have to push about 10 to 15 percent harder. That's a noticable 
&gt; amount. I have the late cylinder in my bus and I'm not real happy with 
&gt; it. I'm getting a '67 cylinder pretty soon.

Okay, going back later this week so can take a proper look then at the
archives.
I think Ronnie said earlier that the Beetle MC was too small, is this small
as in fluid volume within the cylinder? Or as in the diameter of the piston?
I don't understand why he would have to push harder to stop the bus causing
early failure of the MC - I suppose as the pedal effort is less, less fluid
is being moved so the force on the brake cylinders is less.
I expect this has all been covered before so I will have to check the
archives though.

Thanks
Paul
