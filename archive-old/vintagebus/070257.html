Subject: Safari Windows

Thanks for all the replies last week on my question about Safari's. Seems 
like most vote for CE's. Never did hear from anyone though when/if Izzy's was 
coming back. I have a pair on a '67 from a couple of years ago, and they work 
quite well.

No one mentioned Wolfgang's. If I calculate the exchange rate correctly, it 
looks like theirs are a lot cheaper then the CE's. Besides it seems CE has 
their problems also, plus everyone's leak! 

Any opinions?

Jerry
p.s. No one ever got back to me about my 428 &quot;M&quot; code and what it was.
