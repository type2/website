Well, with discs you only get the pad melting kind of fade.

I can buy that the drum expanding causes some fade.  Think about this,
your shoes and drums wear into each other so the shoes are the same OD as
the ID of the drum, thus the whole shoe hits the drum.

Now the drum expands... and your shoe will only be touching fully at one
point, its ID has grown larger.

Think of putting a soup can in a coffe can, the soup can will only touch
the coffe can at one spot. An extreme example, but i think it defines the
problem... Plus, it wouldnt take much in the way of expansion to make this
happen, as the brake shoes are steel with a thin lining and pretty
rigid. .001 of clearance is too much as brakes require friction.

Just MHO,

Steve
