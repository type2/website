&gt;I almost forgot!  I am in the process of going through the electrical on
&gt;my '67 Westy. [...]  One of the more interesting hacks I found was two
&gt;wires going the the same connector on the pass. side tail-light.

Check the wiring diagram.  http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html
This is normal, at least for the running light filament...one wire comes
from the front of the Bus and the other goes to the license plate light.

&gt;Here's the question.  I can do three things: patch this mess (cheap, but 
&gt;difficult and it'll look like hell and probably be about as reliable as
&gt;a politician under oath), get a brand new harness ($$$), or use the harness
&gt;out of my '67 Kombi.

I know $$$ is a consideration but if I were going to string a whole new
harness, I'd buy a new one and do it *once* .

You might consider just using the rear part of the harness from the Kombi
if you don't want to re-string the whole thing.  This takes you back to
the splicing, but at least all your splices would be in one spot and
the rest of the wiring would be neat.

I don't think it would take all that much wire to patch it up.  Is it
just the tail-light wiring that's hacked up or the engine wiring too?
If it's just the tail-lights, you could do a very reasonable job on
them with a spool of 14 gauge black wire, a spool of 16 gauge gray
wire, and red, black, yellow, and purple electrical tape.  They
sell multi-color packs of electrical tape but purple might be hard
to come by - use red and blue together if you can remember.  The
colored tape is to simulate the striping on the stock wires so you
or the next owner can figure it out later.  You may also want some
14 gauge brown wire to run extra grounds to the tail light housings.

For connecting to the original harness you could use those blue
crimp butt connectors, solder/tape, or solder/heatshrink.  Pretty
much your choice.  When cutting the original harness, cut it all
off very long, then make your first splice.  Cut the next wire
back an inch or two and make your next splice.  Keep doing this
so you don't end up with a big wad of splices in one spot.

Bundle all wires with black electrical tape, more heat shrink, or
even some of that corrugated plastic tubing like all the new cars
have.

&gt;How about with the wiring for the Westy stuff like interior lights?

I'm pretty sure this was all &quot;added on&quot; later by Westfalia.  If you
compare the stock wiring diagram to your Bus, it should be fairly
obvious where the &quot;extra&quot; connections (probably mostly to the always-
hot wire at the battery, regulator, or starter) for the Westy stuff
are.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
