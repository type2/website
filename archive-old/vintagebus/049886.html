Subject: Re: [VB] got my bumpers back


&gt;I got my bumpers back from the chrome shop today and all I can say is WOW
&gt;deep beautiful liquid chrome!  The guy did an excellant job of straightening
&gt;it and filling the pea shooter holes that the PO cut in the rear one.  If
&gt;you know the holes were there, you can see it but it's hard.  He has also
&gt;done about half of the little bits and pieces too with more to be sent off
&gt;in a week or so.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I would recommend this guy to anyone in the Portland/Northwest area
&gt;(or even further).
