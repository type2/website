&lt;&lt; &gt; Out of curiosity, do early model year 67 busses have 6v or 12v?
 &gt; 
 &gt; NQ
 
 12 V started at the very beginning of model year 67 as standard
 equipment in Busses. &gt;&gt;

As most of ya'll know VW was very big on mid-year changes.  I have owned a 
couple of 66' factory 12 volt buses.  I'm not sure if these buses were 
ordered with the 12 volts as an option or if they were very early 12 volt 
production runs.  But seeing how you could order your bus with 12 volts as 
early as 1962 the world may never know!  I do find it amusing though that a 
lot of Volks Folks go ga-ga over the 67's when seems to me that the factory 
66' 12 volters would be so much rarer.  I think the reason we don't see this 
so much with 66' and 67' bugs is there were a heck of a lot more changes on 
the bug.  Though some of the wierdness still pops up, like my 68' Ghia with a 
67' swing axle.  The oddities are out there, and for me they just make 
Volkies more interesting and fun.  But it can make getting parts chore!   
Make sure you know what your after,  use your chassis number when buying 
parts.
