I finally added the code to sort the registry stat tables, so they're
somewhat readable.  There are some very interesting demographics showing
up.  Most of the buses in the registry live in Florida.  Most of the buses
are 1967's.  22% are kombis.

There are only 230 buses in the registry, but 400 and something people on
the list!  Come on - join the fray!  Make your bus seen! Become another
statistic!
