Well I had to have help from my neighbor, but we got it so when the
ignition is turned on the front headlights go on, but you have to pull the
knob to get the back lights to go on. I hope that is okay and is not
messing up anything.

My computer is crashing. Almost everything has been backed up and saved,
but the hard drive is making this loud ugly sound, besides all the Window
problems that have been just awful, so if you don't hear from me for awhile
remember that I'm thinking of all that information I'm missing and advise
I'm not getting. Hope I don't have computer troubles and VW troubles at the
same time.

Maybe you'll hear from me again, but I don't know. :(
Think of me driving around in my purple Bus.

Peace to all,
Tara
