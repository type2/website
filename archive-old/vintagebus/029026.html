First of all, Hello list!  I've been lurking for a while, so now I'll show
my face...

Bryan,
Since nobody else jumped on this one, I will.  I know that Westies and
Sundials both used the crank out windows.  The way to tell the diff between
a westy and a sundial is:  Westies have a window behind the 2 cargo door
windows, and the Sundial doesn't.  The Sundials were made out of panel van,
and the windows were added by Sundial, whereas the Westies were built from
a standard bus.

Hope this helps,

I just acquired a 61 ???  The question marks are what I need answered.
The bus has rather interesting &quot;jalousy&quot; windows.  I don't know if I
spelled that correctly but if anyone is familiar with these type of
&quot;wind&quot; out windows, what types of busses did these come on and what type
of bus have I purchased?  I want to call it a camper but the interior is
gutted and there are no seat (except the front ones).  Any info would
help out!
Thanks
