The Split Bus Club's First Annual VW truck meet and BBQ will be this 
Saturday, May 20 from noon until 4:00 at Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo 
CA. Although the emphasis will be for Single and Double Cabs, all Type 2's 
are welcome. 

Exit east onto Springs Road off I-80 then left onto Columbus Parkway.

This meet was originally going to be held at Mark Waterman's Lemon St. 
garage, but due to landlord and tenant issues a new location was needed.

Call Mark at 707-648-1839 for more details. See you there!
