Subject: Re: [VB] WCM mis-representation

&gt; straight piece of foam core door rubber. My question
&gt; is that, was the original seal a 1 piece unit, or was
&gt; it 3 pieces.

The original piece was one piece, molded corners. It also wasn't square, but
triangular in cross section. Not a big deal. You need to cut a birds-mouth
out of the corners so it will fold neatly at each corner and glue it in. Far
easier would be to use double-sided tape. I have seen a custom modification
done in a couple of old buses that worked pretty slick. The offending PO
would take foil tape and stick it around the sides and top of the box. Then,
they would fold it out where the seal should go and against the installed
flap. They would then spooge sillycone caulk up against it and build it up
quite large. I'm describing basically making a sillycone seal with a foil
tape mold in place so it doesn't stick to the door, right? Then, once it had
all dried, they would put a strip of that sticky back felt weatherstripping
on the forward side on the tape for the door to seal against. Looked like it
would work great, and sure as hell wasn't going to fall out. If it started
leaking you could just replace the felt. Not for the purists, I know.
Functional is the word.
