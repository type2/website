Hi Everyone,

	I just finished searching the list archives (BTW, great job Stephen
G.!!) and was unable to find exactly what I'm looking for so here goes.
. .

	Before I left on an extended &quot;trip&quot; of sorts (military) I bought a set
of used SP heads in hopes of trying my hand at porting and polishing
during the slow times out here.  With that in mind, I intend to do both
heads regardless of IF they are rebuildable or not just for the pure
entertainment value of it.  One of the heads is fairly new and is
crack-free.  The other has seen better days as it will need flycutting
(run loose) and some crack repair between the valves.  Actually I'll fly
cut both when the time comes.  

	I've already cleaned the heads and disassembled them but I've
intentionally left the guides and seats in so as not to damage those
bores and also so I could CC them as I go.  

	As far as the intake goes, I'm just planing to smooth and deburr the
ports; leaving the surface swirled and pretty much the same size as
stock.  Nothing too drastic.  I don't want to lose the low-end power.

	The chambers I am planning to slightly enlarge/smooth (to drop
compression) and polish to a mirror finish (believe me, I've got plenty
of time to polish out here ;-) ).  I was planning to carefully grind the
tops and bottoms of the chamber to enlarge them and unshroud the valve
area.  Does anyone have any pointers they would care to share or some
DO's and DON'T's on doing this??

	For the exhaust, I was going to basically do the same as the intake; a
simple smooth and deburr but add a high polish afterwards.  One thing I
was wanting to do was remove the guide boss &quot;nub&quot; that interferes with
the flow through the port.  I've seen heads with P&amp;P jobs and it has
been removed.  Is this boss necessary to protect the  v. guide since
it's in the hot exhaust gasses, or may it be removed without sacrificing
reliability??  What would be the consequences of removing this boss to
increase flow for a daily driver engine???  Any experiences, good or
bad, would be appreciated.

	I know that most of you that read this far are wondering, &quot;Why doesn't
this weirdo just run out and get himself some DP heads and forget all
this P&amp;P on SP heads??&quot;  Well my answer is simple, I don't want to.  My
bus is stock and I want to keep the stock look and simplicity but add a
tiny bit of performance if I can.  The way I see it, if I were to
destroy these heads, I'm only out $25 at this point, so what the heck!!
BTW, I know this was covered in a recent issue of one of the VW mag's
but I think I left that issue at home (DOH!!).  Thanks for any advice
you all can give.
