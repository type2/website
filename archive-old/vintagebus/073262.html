If you are not in the slow lane then move to the slow lane.  If you are or
if it is a two-lane road or a lane then slow gradually and pull off as
soon as practical.  Life is too short and buses too precious.

The problem with ejecting any substance from the rear of a bus as some
suggested is that there is a large vacuum area in the wake of a bus and
&quot;what goes around comes around&quot; very quickly.  Do not eject anything that
you cannot live with yourself.

                             OOK!
