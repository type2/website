Thanks to all who reminded me that VW parts are good things, and the 
chance to show my wife why I keep all this stuff.
I have just moved, so I haven't done much except to pile the stuff I 
have. I will go through it and see what I can do to get rid of, sell, 
send, etc.

In looking at some of the old pieces I thought I would share a little 
bit of information with all about some strange bits that I recall seeing 
when I piled up this stuff. Please help me out be telling me if there is 
any value, please!

I have a oil filler without any drain tube. Very odd to me. Looks 
standard except there is no drain tube comming from it. Doesn't look 
filled or anything like that. Has there been any VW,s without that pipe?

Lots of Vacuum, and semi vacuum distributers.

Bosch Alternator and stand.

For a while, I had a good friend whose brother was a pro welder. He 
always had me match up my heater boxes to the bus I was working on the n 
take it off and weld it around the box to stop the air from escaping. 
Does anyone else do this? I still have several that he did this work on, 
but I don't know if they would match any other engine.

67 decklid, plus rubber seal.
Many, many non doghouse fan shrouds, fans included.
Many, many carbs. All pict 30/31 to pict 28's.
5 or so single port manifolds, and 2 or 3 double ports.
67 front floor mat.

Ok so that stuff isn't all that exciting, but I have that and tin like 
crazy. I will sort and post anything to go later.

You should see my bus (63), I have never seen such a hacked bus in a 
long time. Oil cooler mounted in engine compartment (don't use it), 
spare tire hole covered with tin, 68 camper parts inside, with a mix of 
custom and altered early campmobile seats, late 50's stearing box, cut 
hole in roof with wrong pop top, replaced fuel tank (late 70's I think), 
hole and tin for gas heater.

But...I love my bus! Took it to yellowstone last year, got many happy 
and many mad comments. Camped in it at ten thousand feet! Single ports 
are my friend. 1600, single port, doghouse, 30/31 pict Carb, 
70,000-80,000 miles on it.

Take care
Jason
