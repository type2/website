&gt;any hints on installing new taillight rubber seals?
&gt;
&gt;I'm considering using that 3M Weatherstrip glue to affix the seals to the
&gt;lenses and then worry only about getting the assembly into the metal.


Ouch. That's like doing the crossword in pen. You got lifetime bulbs or
something?

Put the seal on the tailight housing, offer it up to the hole from the
inside. Use your fingers, small screwdrivers, spatulas, hammers, impact
drivers, whatever turns you on and get the rubber lip over sheet metal
around the opening. Adjust and arrange it so you can see the threaded holes
of the housings behind the holes in the body and through the seal. Place the
lens on the seal and adjust and arrange until the seal lip is around it all
the way. Adjust it till the screw holes line up, slip the bezel on, and do
the screws. Tighten it down, but not too tight. After it has lived this way
awhile, it'll come apart and go together easily. You really wouldn't want to
have to chisel the lenses off to change a bulb would you?
