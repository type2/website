Subject: Re: Pulling the Steering Wheel
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi S,
Often applying heat to the center section of the steering wheel will make the 
tapered hole in it expand and pull off.  Some volks use boiling hot water to 
do this.   We would drain and refill the steering box to insure that the hot 
water did not get down the steering box shaft and into the gear box below!
