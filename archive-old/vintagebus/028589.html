&gt; Which brings to mind the ever so common recall.  Seems day after day piece by 
&gt; piece you learn how crappy your car was built.  Does anyone know of any types 
&gt; of recalls with the bus.  I know the bastard 40 was discontinued but havent 
&gt; heard of any recalls.

I think that a lot of stuff that is subject to recall today was just
considered to be a &quot;trait&quot; of a vehicle a couple of decades ago.

For example, we know that early Bay steering boxes are relatively fragile,
and that they were replaced with a more robust unit in late bays.  These
days, such a change would probably be a recall, since it is safety
related.

There's also a lot of recalls because of emissions equipment.
Essentially, the manufacturers have to guarantee that their engines will
remain in perfect tune for 5 years.  Imagine trying to drive your VW for 5
years without touching the ignition or carburator!
