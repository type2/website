The half-moon shouldn't turn, that's its entire purpose in life.  The
only way I've ever seen one do that is if it wasn't seated with the
flat against the tranny case (which also prevents it from pushing in
all the way towards the engine).  If there's no flat spot on your
tranny for the flat on the bolt to mate up with, then the best answer
is to file such a flat into the tranny case.  Just like about
everything else, half-moons are year-specific, and so (technically)
are the tranny cases to go with them....

Push-back is more of a problem with the half-moons.  Using something
to shim-tighten the bolt, or hanging a heavy wrench on top of the
tranny to stop the bolt from going anywhere are the solutions I've
seen (I always use the wrench, since that way I always have to make a
final inspection underneath).
