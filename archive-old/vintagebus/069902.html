So tube size doesn't matter (no jokes please!)?
:-)

I was thinking a smaller tube would read differently than a larger tube. I
didn't take a whole hell of a lot of college though.  :-)

&gt; Eric,
&gt;
&gt; Actually, you could quantify the colored water in a tube pressure
&gt; measurement by first taping the tube to, say the b pillar.  make a mark
with
&gt; a sharpie where the water is with the engine off, then make another mark
for
&gt; the water level when haulin' down the freeway.  Subtract the two
distances,
&gt; then convert: 1 inch of h20 = 0.249 kPa.
