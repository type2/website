Saturday afternoon, I hope to run out to Ernie's (the guru) and have him set
the endplay for me on this engine.  To recap, I'm building a 1776 with 110
cam, semi-hemi cut heads (otherwise stock), and putting on a set of 40IDF's
to push my 66 split down the road at a hopeful 65 to 70mph.

Last night I did the following:

Scrubbed the daylights out of the cylinders with comet.  The paper towels
showed no dirt but man, those cylinders started rusting within seconds of
drying - wow!!!  I got them wiped clean and oiled before it got too much
worse...

I checked the endgap on the top 2 rings of each piston.  This involved
numbering the rings (with a felt-tip marker) and making sure each ring was
associated with it's cylinder.  The Tom Wilson book says to follow the
manufacturer's guidelines for ring gap.  The instructions said that you
should have .003&quot; to .004&quot; end gap PER 1 INCH of cylinder diameter.  Using
ratios, I figured that since the diameter of a 90.5 (or 90.43 as they are
stamped) P/C set is about a thrity-second of an inch over 3.5&quot;,  the
resulting figures would be .0105 to .0140 of an inch. (.003 * 3.5 &amp; .004 *
3.5)  Since the original spec only allowed for .001&quot; variance, I maintained
that this variance would stay the same.  So I spec'd out my rings for .010
to .011 end gap.  Only a total of 3 rings required minor filing to bring the
figure from about .008 to .010.  I never thought something so simple would
be so involved but I got it done.

Now my question stems from a BLATANT discrepancy between the manf.
instructions and the Tom Wilson rebuilder book.  The instructions say to put
the gap for the oil scraper to the side that is in line with the wrist pin.
The rebuilder book says to put the gap at the top so that you don't have a
problem with oil getting past the rings.  I ended doing the following and I
want to know if I did it right or not.

I put the gap for the 3 pc. oil scraper at the top of each piston.  Then I
took the top 2 rings and put their gaps at 180 degrees to each other, aligni
ng the gap with the wrist pin hole.  When viewed from the top, the ring gaps
are 90 degrees from each other, with no gaps found in the bottom 180 degrees
of the piston as it sits in the cylinder.  To make this easier to
understand, imagine yoinking the head and as you look at the top of the
piston, you would see the 1st ring gap at 9 o'clock, the 2nd ring gap at
3:00, and the oil scraper at high noon (not sure whether AM or PM here) :-)

I used my trusty ring spreader from my lawn mower overhauling days and the
ring compressor to install the pistons in the cylinders (after light oiling
of course.)

I would appreciate any help now on setting the compression ratio.  I've had
the cylinder bores faced and the heads semi-hemi'd so I'll have a situation
where the compression ratio is dropped because of the heads but raised
because of the facing.  I wonder if it will equal out?  I'm going for 7.0:1
despite my brother saying that I should shoot for 6.9 due to Berg's
research.  The Tom Wilson book shows a socket extension (straight-edge)
placed over the top of the cylinder and the resultant gap between the piston
and extension measured with a feeler guage.  I've read the book but I'm
still a bit confused as to what exactly I need to measure or to do to find
out what size of shims I might need.

I'm going to research this some more (including the Hoover CD) as well as
check my books again.  There is no substitute for the hands-on advice I get
from you guys so thank you for your time.
