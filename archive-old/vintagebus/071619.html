Subject: [VB] Parcel tray full of water and dodgy speedo backlights


&gt; The front windows do leak onto the dash, and I can see small amounts of
&gt; surface beneath the seal - but I guess if the parcel tray is full of water
&gt; then there must be holes in the window aperture? Or could it just be leaky
&gt; seals causing the problem?
&gt;
&gt; I plan to take out the windows in the next month but I want to prepare for
&gt; what I might find lurking there.

Source the leak on a dry day
with a garden hose.
If you replace those seals, use
roofing tar as an install lubricant,
a deterrent to future rust,
and a very good sealer.
Clean up with parrafin ( kerosene :).
