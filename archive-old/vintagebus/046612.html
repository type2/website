&lt;&lt; My only 2 ideas right now are:
 1.  Open up the belly pan to route the cable.  (Not an option)
 2.  Route the cable outside the pan's next to the gas line.  (Don't really 
like that one)
  any other's out there?  Any ideas on fishing a cable thru? &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt we did this for a friend's DD panel.  She wanted to install 
instruments and needed the trailer cable with the six wires inside it.  You 
just run it through one of the unused cable tubing holes in the cross members 
and use a coat hanger to pull it through.   Eric&amp;Barb
