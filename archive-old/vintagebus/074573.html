&gt;.... Many out there profess to have an understanding SO but in reality there
&gt; is a limit to the amount of VWness the SO can stand. I've been on this
&gt; list long enough (5+ years) to have seen many a bus person dispose of
&gt; busses unwontedly and even relationships dissolve over the ownership of
&gt; said.  Lets face it MOST SO's hate these things.
&gt; 
&gt; So, do you married people have a limit to owning busses, going to shows,
&gt; swaps, et. al??  Be honest.

My SO of almost 25 years has humored me w/ the bus stuff the last 5 years or
so, but I have noticed that every time I bring another one home, she has
showed up at the same time w/ either a couple of dogs rescued from the
shelter or a new house we need to rescue, etc. Therefore I am at my present
limit w/ 3, although when she does look at new houses, she is always looking
for a place w/ lots of garage/shop space, places to store buses!  Not sure
what this means.

She has never gone to a show w/ moi yet, but loves to camp in the westy,
etc.  Her reply is &quot;Tell me what's fun about  driving 1500 miles +- in 5
days to a show, stand in a parking lot talking about buses, drinking beer, &amp;
not having a shower the whole time&quot; - well excuse moi.

This weekend tho I believe we had a breakthru, when she asked what she could
do to help w/ the new wiring harness in the DC-She got stoked when we went
over to a friend's shop where he builds high performance motors, carbs, etc.
&amp; watched him get a motor that had been sitting in a barn for 20-30 years,
running in no time! She thought that looked pretty easy! Knowing her, I bet
she could do it, while not wasting a lot of time trying to figure out the
best layout for the garage, where my 13 mm wrench is, making dinner for 8,
working 2 jobs, nurturing the kids, her girl friends,  &amp; a bunch of old
folks, etc.

Praise Allah or whomever that gives us SO's who will let us indulge in our
little fetish as much as they do.

Tom Buese-haven't got the nerve to bring another one home soon
