Message-ID: &lt;0.81087bff.2571b3b0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

On our 65, both high beams work, but only the passenger low beam does.  I've 
replaced both lights with new ones and it's still the same way.  Is there a 
quick fix to this?  I know the bulbs are good and I know our wiring is a 
mess, but there's only so many places something can go wrong between the 
headlight and the switch right?

Also, when doing a DIY headlight alignment, anyone have any pointers?  The 
adjustment screws on the rings are at about 10 o'clock and 4 o'clock.  I'm 
guessing one's for up/down adjustment and the other's for left right 
adjustment.  Tonight when it gets dark I'll pull the bus to the end of the 
driveway, turn on the lights and adjust away.  I'll have to align them using 
the brights since only one low beam works.  Am I high thinking I can properly 
adjust them with just the high beams or is it possible?

thanks
