 Well, my '71 uses six clamps for a 2-passenger middle seat.  Two for each
 leg &quot;loop&quot;
 
 If your seat has holes for the projections in the clamps, then all you
 have to do is install one clamp for each hole.
 
 I puzzled about the long and short T-bolts too, and finally came to the
 conclusion that the longer bolts are for use when there is a rubber mat
 between the seat and the floor.  I find the longer bolts a lot easier to
 install.  Get the clamp in place, the nut threaded on the bolt, then
 jiggle the seat around until all the clamps are straight and comfortable.
 
 What I would really like to find are wing nuts to fit the T-bolts to make
 removing the middle seat a no-tools exercise.
 
 George Lyle, love my Deluxe Station Wagon!

Wingnuts came with kombis with middle seats for easy removal.  Seems they 
figured if you had a passnger model you would generally leave the middle seat 
in place.  Have you tried your local version of Tacoma Screw?
