  I used to order from Bus Boys, I don't anymore.  The owner Ron just
hires know-nothings to do the skilled job or getting the right parts.  
His prices are not bad, but now I have a bay gas tank cap and 2 bay heater
boxes (with german stickers on them) and other parts that were sent that
are just don't fit my VW and I'd be better off spending a little more and
getting the right parts.  In talking with him on the phone, he does not
know what the right parts are either, so how can he hire someone that
knows?  He sent other things that I did not order and or pay for and I
sent them back, he responded by saying we wouldn't be doing any business
anymore - Fine.  See his response on what his policy is now that someone
went public and compare what he did to me. I don't believe a word he posts
to the list anymore cause most of it is just plain wrong info that he
makes up to sound like he cares or is knowledgeable about transporters or
restorations.  Once your money is in his pocket, and 10 days are up, it is
hard to get it back - period.  You are left holding the wrong part, even
though he knows he could re-sell it much easier?

  When one is doing a full restoration, it may be months before you use
the piece that you ordered and he knows that and still insists that if you
don't notify him within his time frame, you get charge a restocking fee
even if it was his fault.  He charged my credit card for things that would
not be delivered before the credit card statement was due.  That is just
plain illegal. He can't even pack things so they don't get broken in
transit.

  I don't get it.  His store has been flamed in all the Type II, Vintage
Bus, and Vanagon lists many times and he still is in business.  I just
wish someone would open a split parts shop on the East Coast to show him
how a knowledgeable, fair business should be run, since he will not take
any hints from 3 different VW bus lists.

  I've been running a small business for almost 6 yrs. and if I'm wrong,
the customers get angry and I have to make it right and it before it costs
me more.  I can't believe he advertises heater boxes on this list that
can not be hooked up because the connections are in the wrong place. He
won't come clean and just say that when he posts his Bus Depot Specials!  
We should send them all back and make him pay the freight for mis-leading
advertising.
