hello all,

i am thinking of buying a bus that has a hacked up dash, and rusty
windowframes...

the windowframes are almost not there on teh bottom lip.

the dash just has a bigger hole cut where the radio goes.

whts the best way to do this...

cut a whole dash out of another bus, or just cut the radio part?

how is the best way to just remove a dash from another bus, or is it
better to take the dash along with part of the nose and windowframes.

thanks,

Steve
