Hi all,

I was lucky enough to be given a complete and almost perfect set of original
safaris off a '57 single cab. They were given to me, along with a pile of
manuals by a long time friend who is selling his '58 standard. 

Thanks to those that responded to my post requesting info, especially Jeff
Grant who sent me pix of his safaris. I have no idea how to accurately
determine the positions of the latches on the dash and on the windscreen
pillars and I'm sure that to ninimise leaks and wind noise they have to
close up accurately. Thom suggested getting an installation instruction
sheet from one of the repro vendors but unfortunately I haven't had any luck
there.

Does anyone have a repro instruction sheet that they could scan and send me?

TIA  

Michael ( owner of what will soon be the breeziest doublecab in South Africa
- I'm working on a dodgy homemade frameless rear safari hack too!)
