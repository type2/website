&gt; I was once out of official lighter fluid for the grill so I substituted

I've seldom used anything else.  Charcoal ligher fluid is not very
flammable, probably to save the lives of the idiots who spray the stuff on
coals that are already burning.

Gasoline, being more flammable, requires a different technique, namely
&quot;stand way back when igniting!&quot;

YMMV, proceed at your own risk, caveat emptor, LS/MFT
