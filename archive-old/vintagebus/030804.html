Subject: Clutch cable

OK,

in my '65 bus, the clutch bites right at the bottom of the pedal
movement (getting reverse is a case of 'ker-chang'!).

1. Adjuster on gearbox has no more thread available.

2. Spent all last night getting clutch lever off in the hope of moving
it round one notch (non-starter, it can only fit at one position,
despite being a splined shaft).

Soooooo........

Cable stretched?
Cable too long? - (are there many variations?)
Clutch friction disc worn?

any help appreciated.

Simon.
