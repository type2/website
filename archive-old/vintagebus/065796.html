Subject: Re: [VB] Buckin' Bus!-tire tumor

Ya, I had a tire with a tumor on the 65 westy.  It was on the center side of 
the tire, kinda hidden.  Probably that's one of teh reasons that the bus 
handles so much better with new tires!!!!

&lt;&lt; Bucking can also be caused by a broken radial tire belt. Take a close look
 at your tires. A broken belt can manifest as a bulge.
