Subject: Re:[VB]'67 door handle~ part # given
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Watch for the codes on the under side of the door
handle.
1967 outside chromed door handle is part #
221.841.631.C
If not &quot;correct&quot;, it has worked perfectly for years on
my wife's 67 Westy.

The 1963 bus that I drive is:
221.841.631.A

There are also H/G and E/F codes for various
applications. I dont know all of the applications,
just mine and the mistakes that I have made...

WATCH OUT for the differences in shaft lengths that go
through the door to the interior. When buying used
take a second to examine the threads on the inside of
the end of the shaft. When installing new rubber be
careful not to over stress the handle as the shaft may
break right at the base of the handle. Key codes will
be on the base of the handle or on the shaft itself,
depending on year and vendor. Suggest possibly leaving
the interior screw slightly loose untill everything
sets in. 
Assemble fiber/leather washer onto exterior handle
shaft first, then the chrome metal lock bezel, then
the plastic trim ring. 
*Tip: lock the uninstalled handle and chrome bezel
assy with key prior to installation*
With door opened and the top/bottom retaining bars
retracted insert exterior handle in vertical
position/(pointing down).
Insert through door. 
Assemble Spring chrome trim, interior handle, washer
and then screw.
Interior handle faces forward (FIF)/Exterior faces
down when door is opened.
Interior handle faces up/Exterior faces forward when
closed.
-------------
Things have changed. When I did up (didn't say
restore) the '67 SO42, I purchased an NOS '67 door
handle with key, in the box, with the chrome bezel
thing from Blue Nelson for $75.00. In my naiveté' I
thought that was outlandish! Similar to the NOS
factory front floor mat that I bought from that SOTO
person for an outrageous $150.00! Totally outta
control in my mind circa 1994 &lt;not by today's'
prices&gt;.

A good locksmith should be able to re-key the handles
as long as they have the correct series key blank and
code or precut from the correct series.
All business transactions that I have had with Gabe
have been straight up. He does what he says. Tends to
tell you if it is going to take awhile.
Good luck!
