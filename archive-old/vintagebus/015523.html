You are correct.  Water, per se, does not cause rust.  Rust is the
result of an oxidation reaction.  Anything that provides spare
electrons to the iron will result in oxidation occurring.  Where water
comes in is that it's a good solvent (in this case, for oxygen), a
good penetrant (it can get anywhere), and an excellent catalyst (it
makes chemical reactions occur more easily).

For example, things rust in Arizona and New Mexico.  Once the paint's
gone, the rusting happens fairly quickly.  However, it's usually only
a surface rust (unless you mix in a bunch of time), because there's
nothing to carry the ambient oxygen below the exposed surface.  The
only way an oxidizer gets in there is through air movement, which
doesn't work well in the confined crevices of the metal.

Some things are much more effective oxidizers than an oxygen-water
mix.  Just about any strong acid can do a number on iron like you
wouldn't believe.  However, things can get complicated, because some
acids are more interested in the iron oxide than in the raw iron.

The basic process is the iron atoms want to pick up some extra electrons.
When this happens, the atom(s) those electrons are part of come along
for the ride.  Well, now you've got more atoms trying to fit into the
same amount of space.  Obviously, that doesn't work too well, so the
atoms rearrange themselves until everybody's comfortable.  This is
the mechanism behind the crumbliness of rust - that rearrangement is
such that there's less connection between the separate molecules of
rust (grossly simplifying, of course).

Does that cover the basic question?  I'm not really sure how much
detail to go into here....
