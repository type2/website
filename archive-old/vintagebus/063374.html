Subject: Re: [VB] Dual vs single vacuum advance

&gt;The owner, a great guy named Tim, didn't really know which was better,
&gt;the single or dual advance.  I know the single advances the timing and
&gt;the dual advances then retards the timing.

As far as I know, that's correct.  I think the retard only happens at
or near idle as a smog-control function.  The advance happens
throughout the RPM/load range and is, I think, the main thing you are
after when you go to a vacuum advance distributor.

&gt;I'm planning on installing a Pertronix ignition in the new dist, does
&gt;that factor-in to the equation?

I thought you could only put a Pertronix in an 009?  Don't know for
sure.  You might look at both kinds of distributors to see what kind
of room you have - it seems to me like the dual advance with two
rods coming from two vacuum cans would have less room to install a
Pertronix, which is a little bigger than a set of points.
