Subject: PS ... What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

Does this mean they found some sort of broken motor mount or ?? and rather
than fix it they are going to just
rig something to keep it from cracking the case again before the warranty
expires ? Diane

  I called to see how the progress was going on the bus .. The father wasn't
  there, but one of the sons answered.
  I said &quot;have you figured out what caused the case to crack.&quot;  He said ..
&quot;that
  the motor flexing.&quot;  I said &quot;huh ??
