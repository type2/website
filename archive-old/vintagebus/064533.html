Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad? &gt;Photos sell too!

&gt; The HP cafeteria is closed today, so I'm deprived of my coffee and donuts,
&gt; making me grumpy.



Thou shalt not keep caffeine from the IT staff...

I am TRYING NOT to drink any coffee today, not working well. I suddenly
took up smoking, on the 2nd plate of leftover marsala dressing salad
from the party yesterday, and the users are looking like suitable
targets for a pre-emptiver strike. Maybe a strong cup is now in order.
