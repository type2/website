 Ya stick your hand out the window and it blows it away. Think about it. Air
traveling over any surface must be at a speed to take the hot air away. If
the air travels to fast ( to knock your hand outof the way against the
window)  it is going to fast to remove any hot air. If the fast air moving
thru took all the heat away, why have all the tin and shrouds? Why not have
a big hole around the motor? VW spent millions designing all the cooling
stuff and if scoops were needed they would have been added as they did in
1968. Now about oil temp and preasure gauges. VW didnt need them and nobody
else does. Just a big conspiracy for after market jobbers to make money.
Something else to leak and break and blow your motor. Been in Havasu for 29
years in 115 plus temps and never lost a motor due to oil temp or pressure.
Just came back from the classic with ellis, barnes, easterwood, ect in 113
degree temps and all ok.  Doghouse coolers are a must though, even on 36hp
motors as is castrol 20/50 racing oil.  As for 6/12 volt stuff, just buy the
6/12 resister/heatsink form ronnie and dont worry about anything. Have them
on all the busses and no problems. Who cares about amps/ohms ect as long as
they work which they have for me for years. Sometimes people sit and think
to much about theory and forget about how easy things are. Simple is better.
Dont worry about anything just drive your bus. With all the problems? on the
list i'm suprised there are any old busses out there running at all except
the busses in arizonia and 1 bus from Georgia.
 enough for know, VWHOWARD
