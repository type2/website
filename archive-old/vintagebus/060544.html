&gt; With everyone talking about trailers, I had this thought.  I want to know 
&gt; how VW tested its type 2's, and rated the suspension.  Is it a half ton or 
&gt; 3/4 ton vehicle.  What did the factory determine for its towing rating 
&gt; and/or load rating.  

Hi Notorious,
The 1955-63 bus as a standard had 3/4 ton rating.  1963 one could special 
order the one ton suspension which required many one year only parts!  
1964-67 bus had the one ton suspension as standard.  Best to tow something of 
bug or less wieght.  We have towed bugs and KG with no problem on the flat 
straight parts of the road.  Though you have to keep reminding yourself over 
and over that you are towing and to take the corners and downhills slower and 
more carefully!
