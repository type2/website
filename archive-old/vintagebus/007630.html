Everything electrical on the bus is working for sure.  I even got the horn
and rear brake lights to work so I'm set. I need to add a good power lead
for my actual stereo and MP3 player that I plan on running as well.  I also
was able to trim down the mat that goes between the front seats on a bay
window and got it to fit.  It even looks factory.  It's also a great way to
hide the rust in the floor. :-)

I also installed the battery in a plastic marine box and put it in the bus
(instead of sitting it on a 5 gallon bucket in the engine bay.)  Then I
installed my antenna and turned the sapphire into a pretty hot receiver.  I
was pulling in Britney Spears, Sugar Ray, polka, and mexican music all on
AM.  Do I even need a stereo or MP3 player? :-)

So right now, I'm building a dolly out of 4x4 scraps and 2x4's in order to
hold the engine while I test fire it.  I can't sit it on the ground on the
heater boxes because the deep sump sticks out too far and I don't want to
balance the whole weight of the engine on the sump plate.  My little dolly
will allow the heater boxes to rest on the 4x4's while the 2x4's are simply
there to keep things in check.  I'll use some tie downs to anchor it to the
engine so I don't suffer &quot;walking willy&quot; syndrome.

More later...
