It depends a lot on how much you open the window, and which window you
open.  I've had better luck with opening the slider one notch or less
than the wing window.  The increase in heat by doing so was very
significant (like, I was too hot not long afterwards).  I discovered
this by opening the window to stop the passenger-side wing window from
whistling one night.

As to the &quot;wing window whistles less while releasing the latch&quot;, I
would suggest that perhaps there's a break in the rubber somewhere
(it's easy to tear when installing), or the window is actually closing
too tightly, thus bunching the rubber up in one of the corners and
producing a small opening.  You might want to try the wind-tunnel test
- set up a high-velocity fan blowing across the window, preferably
such that you can get the whistle to happen.  One person injects some
high-visibility smoke into the air stream while another's inside the
bus and looking for where the smoke's coming in.  It's a good use for
those leftover smoke bombs from last July.
