Hi Greg,
Definitely a replacement case.  We have a 40HP engine case like this!  It 
needed to be blank so the VW shop that built/installed it could stamp it the 
correct number as the original engine.  Partly so the next mechanic/shop that 
worked on it would have a clue to what size, type and year of engine it was 
to have been built as.  The other reason was for legal purposes.  Some states 
here in the USA used the engine number as the ID number instead of the 
body/chassi number!
