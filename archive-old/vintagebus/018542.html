&gt; I've blown up a few engines myself. After I got over the stress of 
&gt; the
&gt; last one blown, I decided to build my own, the way I wanted it. I 
&gt; had a
&gt; spare engine to run in the meantime, so I could take my time and do 
&gt; it
&gt; right. I learned a lot from the experience, and built an engine I am
&gt; happy with... 
&gt; 
&gt; Borrow an engine, or buy a beater cheap while you rebuild yours, or 
&gt; if
&gt; you have another car you can use in the meantime, that's cool, 
&gt; too... By
&gt; all means look at it as an opportunity!
