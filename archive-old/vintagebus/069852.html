Airflow around the engine bay is not all that predictable.  You're likely
to get a &quot;bubble&quot; of air from the engine recirculated back through the
front of the engine bay.  at the least, you'll get a _lot_ of dust and
dirt kicked up by the front wheels going through the engine.  VW designed
the air inlet system very carefully to avoid this sort of thing!
