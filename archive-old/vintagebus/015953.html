Subject: Fuel Lines
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Volks, I've been told several times to replace and
clamp my fuel lines. I got in the engine compartment
last night and I believe(not being a mechanic) that I
need to clamp the hoses that connect to the fuel
filter  as they are not clamped as of right now. Is
this correct? Any other places I need to check? Any
help
is appreciated. Please email me directly.

Thanks,

Greg
