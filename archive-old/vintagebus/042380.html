&gt; Anyone know where in the Phoenix area I can pick up a pair of inexpensive 
&gt; (re-pop) TL lenses for the '61 DC?  I got a repair order from the local DPS 
&gt; agent, er, officer the other day and I guess I should replace my faded and 
&gt; cracked lenses that show 'white light to the rear'.

or,

you could just get some of that red plastic stuff that people use to glue
over busted tailghts... you know, red plastic film...

and put that inside your glass lenses?

peas,
