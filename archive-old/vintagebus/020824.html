Subject: RE: [VB] Score! jealous 

Things run in cycles and I am apparently way, way, way
out of the vw &quot;cool deal&quot; up swing~ at present...

Past deals:
OG full single cab tilt, including wood, hardware and
canvas from 75-80 year old man for $75.00 after he set
the price &quot;didnt want to hurt me&quot; so he threw in a
full set of 1958-1965 Foreign Car Digest magazines and
a NOS type I seat recliner set in the box.

Bought a 1959 panel with &quot;Solar Advance&quot; painted on
the side and drove it home for $150.00. Like a dumba**
I proceded to pull the engine and tranny and sell it
to someone who became a friend for $300. Will fly back
to RI to be his best man in late September.

'57 PsuedoEuro single cab with 36hp, splitcase,
handcrank, F/R correct ribbed bumpers and tons of
other cool chit that I'd die for now for $1000.00.
Drove it for 6-7 years.

'57 oval rust free and 73k OG miles on it- unaltered
from stock including gas heater $2000. delivered.
Drove it for several years. Sold it for the next
deal... (stupid!)

'83 *aircooled 2.0L* Westy vanagon 23,000 OG miles for
$4000. (1992 pricing) Mint shape excepting of minor
scratch and usual wallpaper delamination. Retired
snowbird resident estate blow out at local &quot;No Bull&quot;
car dealer. They wanted it off the lot ASAP because it
was a Vanagon and they heard that the &quot;heads leaked&quot;.
hahahaha. Sure that some one in the car business could
have had it at wholesale for $2000. or less.

'73 181 soft top with curtains- $650. sold for 3x the
money and still got calls on it many months later.

'67 westy for $200. stripped it to a shell and sold it
for $200. Would be a $3500 bus on VWPlanet now. It was
found abandoned 6 owners and many years later in a
junky part of town. I got stuck with the tow/impound
bill because my name was still on the title. there was
no registration to report as sold to DMV. Live and
learn.

I cringe to think of all of the parts that I've p*ssed
away by not knowing my prices and all of the buses
that I've cut up and shoved away that would be better
than alot of what I see on the current FS sites.
