I've been notified that many of the PDF files on the VW doc project are corrupted.  They haven't always been this way, it likely happened when they were going through some flaky hardware on my end...if someone has these files in working order on their HD somewhere, please let me know and I'll make arrangements to get 'em from you.  AFAIK the GIF files are ok, I haven't checked the ZIP files.  You'll know you have a bad batch if wog69.pdf doesn't work, so42.pdf, and 5867p0.pdf for example.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Andrew W.
