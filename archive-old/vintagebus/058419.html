Subject: RE: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Revisited

I always ask that question of owners when they bring in an engine to
rebuild. What are you going to do with it? Dune buggies, airplane motor,
hovercraft? Then you can leave off a bunch of stuff. In your daily driver
that you don't want to rebuild real soon? Then leave all the factory stuff
on!

Reading this comment brings to mind a favorite quote of mine...

&quot;Parts left out cost nothing and have an infinite service life.&quot;

Chas. (Boss) Kettering

I have always felt that this best answers the question, &quot;Do I really 
need (insert stock part of your choice here) or can I leave it off?&quot;

If it could have been left off, you can bet that the finance guys would 
have insisted on it.  Those two pieces of tin probably cost VW a buck. 
Multiply that times the number of air-cooled engines that they were 
installed on and you're starting to talk real money. I don't think that 
I've ever seen a VW air-cooled engine that didn't originally have them. 
Must have been a sound engineering reason to spend that buck...

Jim

It was written that:

arguement
&gt; about how useless the lower tin was.
