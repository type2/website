Anyone have any luck quieting their bus?  I added a quiet pack muffler and 
it's still loud.  I was looking at this noise reduction paneling stuff in 
the Rocky Mtn catalog, does that help.  I would like to be able to hear the 
radio w/o turning it all the way up or hear my daughter talk from the back 
of the bus.
