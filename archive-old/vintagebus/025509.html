Hi All,

Have looked through the archives and found lots of stories (particularly
of harrowing experiences) regarding the 'tow home', but am now needing a
bit more of the practical experience the group may have.

After a few years of looking, I have committed to a '67 Kombi sans
engine which will be coming to its new home the weekend of the 19th of
June. The bus is currently in Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, B.C. and I am
in Seattle. 

So, methinks, I'll just call Uhaul and rent a pickup or van with a
vehicle trailer and give her a nice ride back. Wrong ! Snotty gal at
Uhaul says no pickups or vans with hitches available. They don't do that
and besides it's their busy season, etc. Local rental yard has  trailer,
but no pickup. Ryder wants minimum rental period or charges...get
this...by the hour !

Now this bus has been sitting  on flat tires for a few years, so
probably won't tow fronwards _or_ backwards with a dolly and maybe not
even with a towbar if I had one, which I don't. I could take up some new
rims &amp; tires except I don't know what kind of situation the wheels are
in up there, but am guessing that the lugs are well rusted.

I certainly would appreciate the list wisdom regarding getting this bus
&gt;from there to here, and especially any information regarding the issues
with border crossings and a recently purchased vehicle.
