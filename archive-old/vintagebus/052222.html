Subject: re:Temp/Pressure Senders


Richard asked:
&gt;Is it true that one should not use sealants or teflon

&gt;tape on the threads of 
&gt;temperature or pressure senders, as doing so will 
&gt;cause the gauges to read 
&gt;incorrectly?  (The cause being that the selant or
&gt;tape will keep the sender 
&gt;from grounding properly). 

===============

Personally, I don't think the sealant will affect the
ground enough to matter.  But it isn't a good idea to
use teflon tape in any situation where a loose bit of
tape could plug or block an oil passage, so I would us
Loctite teflon sealant or other teflon pipe thread
sealing paste, not tape.
