&gt;I have an original side mirror and rear view mirror one cracked the other
&gt;smashed out.
&gt;Does anyone know if a Glass place can cut mirrored glass to fit the frames?
&gt;I want to go  in with knowledge that it can be done
&gt;


I had the rear view mirror from my Karmann Ghia redone at the local auto
glass shop. They gently peeled back the stainless steel lip and removed the
old glass, cut and beveled a new piece, put it back in and recrimped the
housing. Undetectable!
It can be done.
