&lt;&lt; Do the two side Westy camp lights go to the back (engine compartment) of 
the
 bus or some other place?  Or do the go up front to the fuse box and I'm just
 not finding the wire? &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
The wire from the two westie interior lights should go back to the engine 
compartment.  There it will have a fuse holder, and then connect to the 
positive out side of the regulator.   Eric&amp;Barb
