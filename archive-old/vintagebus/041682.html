Ever since I had the engine out a few weeks ago the clutch has been a bit
odd. I was thinking it was something to do with the old clutch disk I
used. Well yesterday afternoon on the way home it let loose so the last
few miles were a clutchless extravaganza.
I made arrangements for someone to cover for me so I could fix it today.
I had 'some' pedal and it felt like either the cable was pulling apart or
the throwout arm. I have an aftermarket throwout arm in there and it has
arms like ferrigno so I figured if it was the arm maybe a weld let loose.
I pulled the cable and it was fine..DOH! another engine pull.
It turned out to be the center disc on the pressure plate. It had broken
loose. In typically frugal fashion I replaced it with another I had on
hand. I greased the clutch cable real good and its &quot;like butta' now.
