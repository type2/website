The easiest and cheapest solution is to calibrate your speedometer and keep
a correction table on the panel for quick reference.

See the Vintage Bus and/or type 2 archives for writeups on the procedure.

&gt;  Also how can I get my speedo corrected without going to stock size tires?
&lt;

&gt;&gt;  You would have to talk to a speedo shop about that.  If they have the
right parts that will fit they will have to replace gears inside the speedo.
