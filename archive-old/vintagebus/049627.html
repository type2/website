Subject: pays to be persistent

Went to the ONLY Vw yard in 6 counties... the regular parts guy wasn't in
today, so they wouldn't let me look for emulsion tubes outta old carbs.
BUT on a whim I asked the sub how much for rear bumpers?
He sold me a near-perfect one for the 65, WITH overriders AND splash
pans... $50.
This was the same one that the regular parts guy was quoting $150+ for the
last few years. New guy told me they had NEVER sold a rear bumper that old,
and they were glad to be rid of it!  Can't complain about the regular guy
too much, tho... he lets me dig around, which they don't let too many do
anymore.


DANG - just realized I shoulda asked the new guy how much they wanted for
the Porsche 40hp hotrod motor that's set there for 2 years!
