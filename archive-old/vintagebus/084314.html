Subject: Trip report - Edisto Freez Yer Toe

Hey y'all
With all the to-do about this and that on other sites, I thought it'd be 
good to post my trip report here so here it goes.

Last weekend between minor crises that abound here at the Karmarosa Farm 
and VW resting place I thought it'd be a good time to get the Award 
Winning Burrito Express (AWBE) ready for a trip to South Carolina and 
Edisto Beach State Park.  Someone was interested in AWBE (70 Dormobile) 
so I thought it'd be a great excuse to go camping.  Oil level was right 
where I left it last fall after pickling time.  Hooked up the battery, 
disconnected the coil wire and she spun over, developing oil pressure in 
almost no time flat.  Reattach coil wire, pump the gas twice and she 
fired right up, stuttered and died, firing right up again on a turn of 
the key and a tickled gas pedal.  Mmmmmmmmmm!

Ease on around the barn, LR tire looks a tad low, but she'll make it to 
the free air place.  Take out all the camping gear and non-essential 
stuff.  It looked like AWBE gained an inch of ground clearance!  Put in 
3burner camp stove, plastic eatin' set, 2 forks and spoons, 3 knives, 
medium frying pan and pot.  Propane tank and the barely adequate tool 
kit.  Over the next couple days keep checking, the essentials are 
there.  Wednesday morning early get out of work early (2:30 AM) so I 
have the whole day to leisurely clean light sockets and connections, 
pack food, the simple things that make buses so nice to have around.  Of 
course I wasn't allowed to sleep.  So I took the day to do just the 
essential safety and operational checks and zoned out.  3 hours sleep 
does that to me and naps just don't seem to help.

Thursday.  Get up, eat leftovers because I didn't eat Wednesday night.  
Take Alex to school, come back, pack cooler, install the portable sound 
system (1 system many vehicles) turn the key and she fired right up.  It 
was about 25 degrees out so AWBE wanted to take it slow for a while, 
over the ridge and to the main road.  Right turn and into town for fuel 
top off, tire pumpups, and drop off some battery cores at Advance Auto.  
Saw my friend Kevin in his new-to-him Vanagon so I knew it was going to 
be a sweeeet ride down.  AWBE averaged 60 - 63 mph on the speedo but I 
know it's about 10 mph &quot;optimistic&quot;.  That's ok with me because all the 
folks in a hurry go around and my peace of mind remains peaceful.  In 
the bus I'm not in a hurry and I much prefer having more time to stop or 
change lanes, or just read what the traffic patterns are instead of 
trying to get ahead of the person in front of me.  Dusting of snow on 
the ground north of Lincolnton.  Did I feel just a stutter?  Naah.

Into Gastonia where no one gets peace of mind unless they're not 
driving, blonde female in a dung-beetle cuts me off and gives me a peace 
sign.  I flip her off just for fun - see her eyes widen in the mirror 
and I grin.  Onto I85 for a bit, stay in the right lane at 60 indicated 
and let the harried hurried folks hustle along trying not to play bumper 
cars and failing.  Another stutter up that hill?  Naaah!

Onto 485, stay in the right lane, let 'em flow around, 485's a nice cut 
around Charlotte, another non peace of mind place, merge onto 77s.  Stop 
at the rest area in South Carolina for a stretch and a peek under the 
bonnet.  Everything looks fine, oil level's right where I left it.  No 
sign of where the stutter could have come from.  Down 77s, another hint 
of a stutter, I notice every time it's going uphill is when the random 
stutter hits.  No longer random.  It doesn't feel like fuel starvation 
because it happens so quick it's more like a switch than a choking.

Merge onto 26E towards Charleston.  See the BP station has gas for 
2.04.  Just so happens that was a planned fuel stop anyhow.  Oil level's 
unchanged - this engine's finally settled in, about 6500 miles now and 
she runs strong, cool, and doesn't use any oil.  Whoever buys this bus 
gets a sweet runner.  Down 26, no drama, merge onto I95.  I picked a 
good time to make this run because except for rush hour in Gastonia I've 
had light traffic.  Stutter quit too.  Take the exit into Walterboro, 
pull into wallyworld for propane and cold weather shoes because these 
chaco sandals just don't do enough to keep my feet warm in this 35 
degree weather.   Call the Mrs to let her know I've got propane so don't 
bring any for me.  Down 64 to 17N to 174E to Edisto.

Go to the gifty shop because that's where you register.  Nobody's 
there.  Pull back out towards the campground and see a grey and black 
bay by the little shed near the campground entrance.  By the time I get 
there the bay has gone in.  South Carolina park rangers are an odd 
bunch.  You get used to them doing one thing then they change everything 
around.  Kinda like when I was in the service, sometimes change happened 
just for the sake of change instead of addressing the core issue.  They 
wondered why I retired when I was so good at what I did.

Registered, pulled into my site one way, didn't like that so I turned 
around and backed in , didn't like that either because the wind was 
rippin' so I finally put AWBE beam to the wind for a wind break.  Walked 
down and said Hi to Tony and Paula who happened to be riding in that 
nice grey and black bay I mentioned a while ago.  Walked around and 
waved at the guy in the eurovan until I realized he was trying to put 
his pants on while bent over (non pop-top EV) and figured maybe he'd 
rather be alone right now.  Walked down the beach to the access by site 
9, called Anton so he could post the gate combo.  My cell phone only 
works in that 1 spot, and I have to hold my left arm parallel to the 
beach and keep my right leg precisely 3 inches above the ground or the 
cell reception goes away.  That being done, I went back to the site, ate 
dinner, watched a couple more buses roll in.  Adam rolled in and I 
offered to share the site with him, he accepted and I got to meet Arlo 
the lab/pitbull.  Cool dog and Arlo soon figured out I know most all the 
good places to scratch on a dog.  Finally to bed after the fire I built 
to wood furnace specs failed to heat the outdoors or make the wind stop 
blowing.

Friday dawned but I didn't see it, being asleep.  Kurt came by and 
started rockin' the bus until I yelled something about who dares disturb 
the sleep of Mad Uncle Dave, but Kurt made up for it by having coffee 
made by the time I got to his site.  Of course I had to do something in 
return so I made Pancakes.  Pancakes and camping.  Mmmmmmm.

Watch folks roll in all day Friday, greetings all around, help set up 
where needed and keep out of the way when I'm not.  It's much harder to 
do the latter than it sounds.  About 5 p.m. unplug AWBE, fire her up for 
an evening in Goose Creek where we used to live, made arrangements to 
see some friends.  There was a new malfunction junction to take place of 
the old one so I ended up halfway to Summerville before I could get 
turned around again.  Finally get to where I was going, hung out for a 
while.

Oh yeah.  Remember the stutter?  Bus shut off completely on the on ramp 
to Rt 526.  I said an unkind word (ok, maybe 4 of them).  Got out opened 
the bonnet.  Looks the same still.  The on ramp is an uphill.  See a 
pattern yet?  Wiggle the coil hot lead.  The wire feels funny. like it's 
broken under the insulation.  Wiggle and juggle and reroute it so the 
bad spot makes good contact and off we go into the sunset (well parallel 
to the sunset now) with nary a hiccup or stutter for the rest of the 
trip.  I'll replace bad spot in the wire tomorrow.  No I won't replace 
the bad spot with another one, I'll replace that section of wire so 
there's no more bad spot.  Bad spot!  go lay down!   uhhhh sorry got 
carried away there.


Leaving my friends, back to the campout we went, backing into the site 
because the wind shifted.  Plug in and walk around campsite hopping 
until almost 2am.

Saturday dawns.  I saw that one because I got up to pee.  Back to bed 
for a bit then up to cook chourizo for the burritos.  Full Moon Bus Club 
breakfast burritos are truly a wonder.  I can eat 2 even!  The chourizo 
went fast but I got some anyhow.  This year tried a spinach and a sun 
dried tomato tortilla,  sure was good.  Post breakfast hangout time, 
helped Adam pull the AC compressor out of his bus.  Seems I can never 
camp without getting bus on my fingers.  I like getting bus on my 
fingers though.  Rain and drizzle all day.  When I woke up my neck said 
&quot;hey man I'm here and you're gonna be hurting by afternoon&quot;.  Sure as 
anything I was hurting by noon.  Ever tried playing Bocce throwing off 
hand with a tweaked neck?  I had to stop after a while.  Ben gave me a 
couple Goody powders and they helped a bit.  Royce had a handheld 
massager (DONT go there) and it too did a lot to help untwist my neck.  
I was able to approach what passes for normal in Mad Uncle Dave's world 
by evening.

At the door prize ceremony I won some glow in the dark thingies and the 
grand prize too!  Snoopy had sent a set of lighted bocce balls.  I no 
longer can say I never win the cool stuff because these are veritably 
the bees knees, the gnats nads, and da bomb all rolled into one!  I was 
a bit unsure about putting the batteries in since they came all the way 
from Iraq and they could have C4 in them or something but since I'm here 
writing this it's kinda evident I didn't get all blowed up.  I talked it 
over with Steve &quot;Killian&quot;.  I don't know if I'll make many campouts this 
year because of a 4 letter word that ends in 'k'.  Starts with a 'w' so 
don't get all uptight that I was gonna cuss on the lists or anything.  
We decided that Tom W should be the true recipient of the flashing balls 
of bocce because he's on tour and will get a lot more use out of them 
than if I kept them.  So we got them all flashing and presented my balls 
to Tom who was appropriately impressed.  Shortly thereafter a bocce game 
broke out and it was _very_ cool to see the balls flashing by.  Kinda 
reminded me of back in &quot;the day&quot; when I used to see stuff like that a 
lot but no bocce game was anywhere nearby......

The wind was a-howling but the clouds went away and we had a glorious 
sky with close enough to a Full Moon to look at.  Campfires roared and 
sparked and people were hanging out and I became recharged with what 
busing is all about for me.  Camping with just a few or up to 400 of my 
very closest friends in the whole wide world.  It isn't about lists or 
forums or e-mail.  It's about camping, breakfast burritos, seeing 
someone's eyes light up when you show them your balls (Bocce darnit get 
your mind outta there!), getting bus juice on your hands and liking it.

Finally to bed.  Neck kept waking me up and finally at 5am I gave up and 
went and stood under a hot as I can stand shower until the muscle 
relaxed a bit.  Took a handful of kidney and liver killers , packed the 
bus and off we went.  Fueled up the bus, stopped at Waffle house and 
fueled me up.  Pretty little waitress spilled almost a whole pot of 
coffee on herself.  I seem to have that effect on people.  She was ok 
though, I got cold water on it within a few seconds so instead of burned 
shoulder and neck she got a wet shirt.  Then I went back around the 
counter and finished my breakfast.  The whole staff was thanking me and 
somehow I got a significant discount on my meal.  Then the manager asked 
if I had jumper cables because his alternator had quit the night before 
and it was time for him to go home.  So I did 2 rescues at the Waffle 
House in Walterboro because I did indeed have cables.

Back the same way I came, no drama, running 60 - 70 indicated, sometimes 
a little slower on the bigger hills.  1 fuel stop at exit 79.  Found out 
I won the lottery, had a winning ticket.  It was worth $4.00 

Over the trip AWBE averaged 19.2 mpg, no oil consumed, 1 inconvenient 
easily &quot;fixed&quot; breakdown.  758 miles round trip.  Didn't sell the bus 
but at least I had a ride home.  Otherwise I was going to buy a plastic 
gas can and stick my thumb out.  That or ride as far as Charlotte with 
Kurt.  His Eurovan has heat so that's probably what I would have done.

Morgan the German Shepherd was glad to see us roll in, maybe because she 
knew she was going to get a belly rub and she did.  Kizzy Cat came and 
yelled at me until I filled his food dish.  He has a friend over for 
dinner every night and so the cat food doesn't go near as far as it 
should.  Zaphod Bebblegoat and Trillian each got corn and feed and they 
made appropriate happy goat noises.  Unpack the bus in less than no 
time, start the laundry, clean and light the wood furnace.  Nice to be 
back home.

When's the next campout?
