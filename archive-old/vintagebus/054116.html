Subject: Re: [VB] Case Bore Size?

Gee... and here I thought the behavior that 
downgraded the list was people who post questions 
that are easily answered by doing a little research 
intsead of asking stupid questions, then acting 
like they cannot wait over 6 hrs for an answer...

There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.

The answer to your question can be found on a 
hundred web sites, with the easiest being in the 
type2_dot_com library under &quot;engine letter codes&quot;.

Since you are probably too lazy to find that, the 
url is http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm

&gt; Blow it out your A** smart mouth.  This is precisely
&gt; the kind of behavior that downgrades the list.
&gt; Some people are learning others, like yourself, 
&gt; are simply idiots.

&gt; &gt;Get a freaking clue and stop acting like a
&gt; &gt;spoiled brat.  A &quot;B&quot; case is a 1600.
