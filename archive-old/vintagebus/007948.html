NQ here - writing under Rob's email addy.  Sorry for the rotten formatting
as I forgot to take off the html setting for the message and the Mail Filter
rejected it.

Well everyone, we finally made it home at 6:00 this morning..  I've got one
heck of a long =
trip report to write and after discussing it with Ronnie, have come to =
the conclusion that it would be best to post it off the list on a =
website so that everyone can read it at their leisure.

It seems that many of you were interested in our little trip as Terry =
Wolfe's mirrored website with indexed photos of mine generated over =
7,000 hits.  That is outstanding and I for one am thrilled that there =
was this level of interest.

I had plenty of time to think on the way back.  Of course the same old =
words apply, (Wow Outstanding, Thrilled, words can't say enough, etc. =
etc.) but I'm hoping that I can eventually convey the reality of this =
event to everyone of you within the next few days.

I have come away from this event a changed person.  After personally =
meeting 41 of the listees (as the dead list shows), I've come away with =
a newfound appreciation for what we've got here.  It's something very =
special folks - we've got a knowledge base and camaraderie here that I =
don't believe is equaled anywhere but in close-knit groups such as =
Harley riders and whatever air-cooled adventurers are out there.  I can =
now say I've got lots of friends for sure among the listees and anyone =
that doubts my &quot;net connections&quot; are anything but a mere online fantasy =
are sadly mistaken.

The trip home last night was long.  I drove Britt's 68 Crew Cab over 100 =
miles from Havasu towards Vegas and Britt kindly nursed us in the last =
few miles in.  What a stark contrast the airport was to the BBB event.  =
Pissed off people, rude SOB's, and stuck up, impatient jerks was a =
sudden reality check that I had yet to witness anywhere on my trip.

The ride home on the plane was only 2 hours and 15 minutes.  As I =
watched Vegas slip away onto the horizon, it was that point that I was =
suddenly saddened - leaving behind what has got to be my most memorable =
trip in my 29 years of life.  I view all my trips as adventures and =
experiences that I can build upon and in my never-ending quest for =
knowledge on different fronts.  It was my first commercial flight (and =
the flight home was a white-knuckler) and my first time west of the =
Rockies.  I've liked what I've seen and I will return.

I slept most of the way home, occasionally being awoken by my head =
tipping forward and hitting the seat in front of me.  As we neared =
Omaha, the plane descended.  I watched Lincoln roll by as we covered the =
60 mile - 45 minute drive between Lincoln and Omaha in about 7 minutes.  =
Travel-worn Vegas losers filled the plane (I'm a $1.50 winner by the =
way!) and evidently brought back more in the form of weight gain and =
souvenirs as the reverse thrusters screamed out in pain upon landing.  I =
heard various expletives in my immediate vicinity at this point but I =
looked at Rob and smiled - the rougher the better - I get a high off of =
flying.

I'm going to spend most of my time today on pictures.  I've got lots =
more that were never posted including a nice big zoom in panoramic shot =
of the whole event that is going to give you all a good idea of the size =
of the campgrounds.  Believe it or not, I didn't get every VW =
documented.  It's a demanding yet fun task and I'm thoroughly flattered =
and honored that I got to have a hand in documenting the BBB V event.  I =
never dreamed that I would be able to help in this way. =20

Before I sign off, I can say that highlights of this trip were many - =
the #1 being the personal meeting of the listees.  I was totally blown =
away by the celebrity-like treatment I received - I never realized that =
so many listees read my posts and save them for whatever reason.  I am =
so grateful that once in my life I was able to experience the feeling of =
people coming up to me (some that I didn't know but know now) who knew =
who I was by my posts and past photos.  As one guy said, &quot;I feel like I =
already know you from all your posts - your ups and your downs - all the =
things we all go through.&quot;  Members of the Havasu contingent - Ronnie, =
John Howard, Lou and Liz, and Phillip and Catherine have all become good =
friends of mine in an overnight way.  These people are genuine VW nuts - =
the true epitome of what I envision our VW camaraderie to be.

The icing on the cake for me was the total surprising of Ronnie.  Britt =
had been one of the first 10 buses at the show.  Ronnie wasn't there yet =
but after Britt and I had some breakfast at the local BK, we came back =
and there was Ronnie - recognizable as ever.  I just kind of stayed =
sitting back in the Crew Cab as Britt rolled up to Ronnie.  I just said =
something dopey like, &quot;Hi Ronnie - guess who?&quot;  He just looked and =
squinted - and realized that No Quarter did make it after all.  Ronnie =
had been wondering what was going on as Rob and already met up with him. =
 I think I remember Ronnie saying, &quot;You ARE big.&quot; :-) =20

That in a nutshell is the trip report.  I've got tons of thanks to =
bestow and lots lots more to tell that I hope I can get the time to =
write.  I'm going to try and caption the photos which will be a daunting =
task  I've got 29 1.44MB disks of pix with 99% of those being filled (17 =
to 23 pix per disk.)

It's great to home but what an AWESOME trip it was.  I'm gonna have one =
helluva story to write when I'm an old man.

NQ and Rob Laffoon
