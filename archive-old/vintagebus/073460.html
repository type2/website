Subject: Re: [VB] Road music or not

Google &quot;mexican german music&quot; and read about the cultural exchange that happened 
in the German Belt of Texas. High energy music, salsa meets sauerkraut. For 
American versions pick up tunes by Brave Combo and Polkacide (Blitzkrieg over 
Kenosha). Cuban is good too. My favorite south of the border musician is 
keyboard pounder Eddie Palmieri. To complete the circle, he performed on a 
&quot;Latin Side of John Coltrane&quot; compilation.

&gt; Ya know, the bass riffs on some of that stuff are pretty cool.  Several
&gt; years ago, I lived about 1/2 a block from an apartment complex where
&gt; probably 90% of the people would run if the INS van showed up.  On
&gt; Saturday nights, the Budweiser flowed like a river, and the boomp-boomp,
&gt; boomp-boomp, boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp flowed until the wee hours.
&gt; It's tolerable when everything above 5mhz is filtered by distance
&gt; and drywall.
