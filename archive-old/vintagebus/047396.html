Subject: Runaways and safety: was '79-&gt;'60 Brake Swap; I have Brakes Again!
To: kn6f_at_dolphinsci_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;&lt; You can count on the fact that I will never jump into a moving car again 
in attempts to stop it.  Let it go, just let, it, go.  &gt;&gt;

Definately, never try to catch a runaway vehicle.  That's good advice to let 
it go.  I lost a friend to a runaway loader a few years back.  The emergency 
brake failed on the front end loader, and it was headed towards the worker's 
trucks, so John ran to it, jumped on, and was crushed to death when it 
overturned.  Auto body work is expensive, but not as bad as hospital bills.
