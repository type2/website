Subject: 67' Oil Cooler Conversion

I am rebuilding an engine for my 67 bus.  The engine I am working with is
out of a 67 beetle 1500 singleport.  My problem is with the oil cooler.  The
one off my bus engine is the newer doghouse style.  The one on the bug
engine is the ole style without the doghouse and of course #3 is going to
run hot.  Does anyone have any info. on converting this to the newer
doghouse style or what my options are??

Thanks,
Jose
