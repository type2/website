Subject: Re: [VB] 5D vs 8G

Looking at my original motors that are easily accesible:
One og 25hp motor- all 5D for fan and coil
One og 36hp motor- all 5D for fan and coil
One 36hp with mismatched- all 5D for fan except for one &quot;65&quot; (or 6S if you think its an S, its dark
outside) and both 5D on coil.

So now you have one more letter desigantion to add to your list, 65/6S. But that mismatched bolt
looks like its off another part of a VW because the head of it has some dove blue paint on it? cant
think of what tho.

You didnt want non 36 hp stuff did you? I got some 15/1600 laying around i could check.

Ill tell you the rest when i move some stuff here in the next few months if your still interested.

&gt; I'd like a survey please. go out and check the hex bolts that are
&gt; holding the generator plate onto the fan shroud. and while you're at it,
&gt; check the coil bracket bolts.. They should be 6x10 Kamax bolts but what
&gt; letters do you have???
