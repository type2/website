Subject: Good junkyards around San Francisco?
Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.929693355.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

I'm going to be visiting in San Francisco next week, and since I live
in Massachusetts, I'm hoping splitties will be more plentiful and
less rusted-out in junkyards out there.  Can anyone recommend good
hunting grounds near San Francisco, the city proper?  I'll have access
to a car, so any place within a reasonable distance is fair game.
I'm looking for simple stuff like an E-brake lever, splash pan, various
door hardware, bits and pieces, all for a '67 Kombi.

OBTW, my '67 &quot;Aquarius&quot; is now rolling happily along on 4 Michelin MX's
with reinforced sidewalls, mail-ordered from the Tire Rack.  Handling is
*much* improved!  It's even easier to control in a crosswind.

The hardest part was finding a tire shop with the right adapter to
balance the old 5-bolt rims.  If anyone else in Eastern Mass has this
problem, try Advance Tire in Cambridge, 617-864-8989.  (Kevin Guarnotta
was heading there too; it would be funny if they suddenly get a whole
parade of old busses!)
