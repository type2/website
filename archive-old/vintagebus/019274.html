Remember my statement about you can't get *any* straight, dry bus for under $1k?

Um, I may be eating those words...  I was at the local FLAPS (Pozzis VW)
yesterday, and he told me of a single cab that just went up on his 
For Sale board.  He said the lady just ran in, stuck it to the wall, then
ran out.  The pic looked &quot;OK&quot; so I called her and set up a meetin'.

Tom Mink and I went over this morning to look at the bus, which was only
a few miles from my house, and only a couple miles inbetween 2 of the other
local VWFLAP's - about 3/4 mile away from one, and maybe 2 miles from the other.

After all of the usual poking and proding, I bought it.  But as they say,
that's not all... We had to go to the owner's house to get the paperwork, 
so Tom &amp; I piled into the panel and followed them back to da hood to get
the papers and an extra side gate she had.  While we were there, I noticed
a 36hp engine on the ground in pieces; &quot;does that come with it?&quot;  I asked
&quot;Sure, why not!&quot; they said.  I started poking around, and saw *another*
round-top fan shroud poking out from a pile of junk. &quot;How about about
that one over there?&quot;   &quot;Sure, take it if you want it&quot;  I went over and 
pulled all the junk off of it, and sure enough, a *complete* engine, 
pulley-to-flywheel, air-cleaner-to-heaterboxes - everything except the muffler.
Tom looked up the engine # in the idiot guide (which I keep in the bus)
- are you ready?  It's a 1949/1950 25hp, complete from bow to stern!
Not all of the accessories are correct, but it does have the different fan,
but not the seamed fans shroud, and it had a 23PCI carb (for more power, I'm
sure)

Now, about the bus.  It's a '55, but I can't put it in the registry yet 
because I'm in the middle of re-installing my PC.  I have a ton of pix
ready to upload too, which will be later tonight, hopefully!  It's 
reasonably straight, with some lower nose issues, some rust on the front 
floors, and holes in the short-rocker section on each side, but the 
main rockers are solid, the corners are fairly straight, nothing is really
hacked on the car: wheel wells are intact, dash is intact with the OG
block-off plate.  There's a label on the dash that says &quot;for official use
only&quot;   It has a 36hp motor, (although not a 20- case) and the OG
split-case tranny.  After we started it up by jumping off their pickup,
I drove it home.  It has fair brakes, and a nice howl in 1st, although
I'm sure it's low on trans fluid. All the gears work though.  Correct
center-brakelight engine lid even, but a &quot;notched&quot; later apron and
58-61 taillights, but the original taillight holes are unmolested, just
a single extra hole drilled above each light to hold the later taillights.

It even has current registration!  

FWIW, of all the buses I've owned, this is only the second I've driven home!
Getting it home was a challenge; it turns out the generator doesn't work, 
and about 2 miles from home, what little charge in the battery gave out.  I
started the 60, removed it's battery and taped off the positive lead, then
put it's battery in the 55.  BTW - you CAN run a 6v car on a 12V battery -
ask me how I know...  So I get the '55 into the driveway, look back and...
where's Tom?  I waited a few minutes, then set out again in the '55, 
backtracking to look for him.  He'd stalled the '60 at a stop sign, and 
of course, with no battery, he was SOL.  So I took the '55 *back* home,
removed the battery, then took the 911 and the battery back and reinstalled
it in the 60, so everyone could get home.

The truck cost me $1000 out the door, and that price was negotiated before 
I even knew there were extra engines and stuff to be thrown in!

What am I going to do with it?  I have no idea; I'm never looking for a 
bus - they always find me.  I *could* put the BD aside, open up a can of
whup-ass and have it painted by KP...

The chassis # is 20-131575 June of '55 (the '55 westy's chassis # was 20-124438)
