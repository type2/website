Subject: [VB] Checking the oil?
Message-ID: &lt;382704A3.E3A37058_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;

OK!! Here comes a thing that is &quot;bugging&quot; me and everyone that I show it
to! I own 4 VWs---and keep the oil level according to the dip stick at
the 3rd mark. Checking the oil level in Ruby the 71 VW Empi Limo--62
Herbey--63 VW Hearse Drakula,--upon taking the dip stick out--the oil
level is right on the 3rd mark--re-enter the dip stick and immediately
pull out the oil level still reads on the 3rd mark.---Except for Bessie
the 67 Grateful Dead bus--When Bessie has been sitting --I check the oil
level by removing the dip stick--it reads right on the 3rd mark! BUT
upon re-entering the dip stick and removing it immediatly--it reads on
the 2nd mark! a quart low!. If i wait a few minutes and re-do the dip
stick--it does come up to the 3rd mark. Question--what is going on
inside the crankcase to cause this? No i'm Not using 100 weight oil that
is so thick that it takes a while to level out.--   world's worst
mechanic--uncle jerry
