I am not perusing this, was only informing those on the list of a good
story, I have enough buses and projects to keep me busy for a long time. I
hope somebody does find this bus, the story is true and the bus must be out
there, if Greg didn't already find it and is keeping quiet. Good luck bus
hunters.

ps. I have a 68 Dormobile FS with Devon camper interior

check the wrecking yards for their car sales.  Pick-Your-Part, sells chairty
donations for the charitys and keeps 10%.  Those are the &quot;runners&quot; that are
parked in front as you walk in.  Ask if they have any other soon to come out
from in the back.  Be persistant and you will find it.  Should sell for
under
$1000.  I doubt that the wrecking yard would know a Binz from a (dang what
rhymes with Binz?)...

Came across a complete '83 BMW with 46K miles.  Was a doctor's second car
and
spent most of its life under a carport down by the ocean (which accounted
for
the shiny paint with rust holes in the corners) [I spoke with the Dr and
confirmed this].  Drove and had no problems, they wanted $650 to drive it
away.

These donated cars receive salvage titles which will clear the slate for the
new
owners as far as back registration (in some cases can exceed the value of
the
car).  One just needs to get a smog cert at a test only station (not needed
here) and brake and light certifications.

Happy Hunting
