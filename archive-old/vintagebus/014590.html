 Rod bearings... damn.  One more thing I guess.  I still have to figure out 
what
 to do with my manifold: the heat riser is totally plugged.  no way I can get
 a coat hanger through there.  I got a new oil pump and oil cooler, good thing
 'cause mine was broken at the base.  Also am putting in a temperature gauge
 so I don't overheat it again... I think I drove up too many mountain highways
 in August.  It lost a lot of power then.
  &gt;&gt;

rod bearings aren't that big a deal.

I put a piece of old clutch cable on a dril to clear the heat riser, and tap 
it with a hammer.  works pretty good.


You will find all this worth it when the bus is together.  don't get 
discouraged
