Interesting, as they'd been spamming the VW newsgroups relentlessly for
quite a while.  The good old &quot;pump and dump?&quot;  This site was appeared to be
designed from the ground-up as a revenue-generator (alternator?).  The
problem is, there are so many good, *free* sites, like thesamba_dot_com, why
would one pay for it?

&gt;It can be sold as just the name or with our hosting package (UK).
