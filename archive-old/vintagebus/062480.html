Subject: Re: [VB] '67 Model Year Myths

Reverse lights were an option from much earlier than 1967- M 47 I believe.  
Ambulances had reverse lights, and anyone else who wanted to pay a few more 
DeutchMarks. pretty uncommon option.   

    The pre 67 bus w/ reverse lights had a switch that screws in under the 
speedo cable, so the light comes on when the bus (or more specifically, the 
left front wheel) rolls backwards, not when it is in reverse gear, capice?  
The 67s got the switch in the tranny, so when you put the bus in reverse the 
light comes on whether or not you are rolling (if ignition is on).   

  Early 67s did not have reverse lights.   Partway through 67 they became 
standard, and so if you see a splitty with two reverse light mounted about 
the taillights, odds are its a late 67 (once in a while someone added them).

The dual MC was introduced at ch 217 019 487. 
  I have 2 67s, both made in the end of sept 66, both have dual MCs and no 
reverse lights- VINs are ~ 237 033 xxx.   so they were added sometime after 
that.

Many, Many, Many, MANY changes were made at seemingly random times, rather 
than at the beginning of a model year.  you have to take it with a grain of 
salt when someone calls a part a '67' part or whatever year.   If you keep 
the bus long enough, you might pick up some of the vins parts got swapped at. 
  My 61 was buildt on April 11th, which was the day they changed the dash 
tray, and the only reason I remember that date.   why it was changed halfway 
through the model year I have no clue, but lots of things were done that way. 
 At the beginning of April they changed the interior fabric used.  This is 
crucial, as I wanted the april 61 - 64 interior, with the pointy turn 
signals, which combination was only available april 61 through end 61 model - 
unless I found a euro bus which is not so easy here. (they kept pointy turn 
signals through 63).  which is another thing- specs for differnt countries 
made the buses different.  
  the huge change from barndoor to post barndoor splitty was made in spring 
of 55- partway through the model year- (which at that time i think still 
started on Jan 1st) through some people consider the '55 bds are part of the 
54 model year and claim the 55 model year started with the first post bd bus. 
 whatever.

anyway, the model year concept is mostly a myth, or a rough guideline.

&lt;&lt; My 67 Deluxe does not have backup lights.  I thought they were an option
 that year.
