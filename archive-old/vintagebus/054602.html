I just got home and am in the process of downloading over 1200 emails
and am
amazed at some of the offers for help I see. All I can say is thank you from
the bottom of my heart and that I'm home in Cali and Roadcow is safe for 1
month. I was traveling at night and running very hard about 4800 to 5000 rpm
trying to get home before the snows hit the Donnor pass and I neglected to
stop and add oil after I switched gas tanks ( Roadcow is blessed with 2 15
gallon tanks due to her builder Ron B. )  which was SOP and I just ran the
darn thing too hard with too little oil and I threw a rod I think with all
of the noise and vibration. I'm impressed with the Toyota engine which even
started and idled at 800 rpm in this condition! I managed to secure storage
for 11 month and hitch a ride to Sacramento, Ca. about 50 miles from my
home. Just have to figure out how to get back there and drag the old girl
home or transplant a new Toyota 3TC or 13 TU engine???
Thanks again.
