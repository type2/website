I forgot to mention in my last posting how I've learned to static time a
dizzy at work...

Hook up your test light between ground and the neg side of the coil (the
terminal that the condensor is connected to). Adjust the distributer so
that when you turn the engine over by hand, the light comes on at TDC,
or maybe a little advanced from that... that gets you close enough to
get the engine started. At that point, you can fine tune the timing with
the strobe (or if you're more talented, by ear).
