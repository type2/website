Subject: on the road to jerome 2001
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

about two years ago i heard of the jerome az. show
and for some odd reason i just have to go to show i dont know why its 
something in the back of mi head
so this year i picked up a 59 kombi and when i bought this fine machine i 
vowed o go to the jerome show of 2001 . so far ive picked up a new zero mile
1600cc if jus purchaced a gene berg dip stick sensor and this wednesday im 
ordering my tranny from i.t.s im also planning to install a typeIV oil 
cooler. does any one have any input so i can make  
the 1500 mile round trip any more worry free?
