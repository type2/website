What problems would I run into putting a set of '66 front cab doors onto a
'59 Kombi?

I know the handles are different. Is the door the same otherwise?

No, dont do it.

the door mechanisms are different.  The bit that the door mechanism latches
onto is different.    Your could bolt in on and make it work, but you'ld need
to mangle it.   A door from a Dec 18, 1963 and earlier (pull type handles)
bus will work and latch properly.     In mid60 or early 61 they changed the
door from the flat area wher ethe handle goes on to the indentation.  I am
not talking about the knucke space here.

If shipping wasn't a pain I'd offer to trade you doors, cause I have some
nice early ones.
