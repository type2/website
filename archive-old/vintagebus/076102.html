Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 6-19-03

Today after work I made a trip to the auto parts store. I got a set 
of headlights and parking light bulbs. Also bought a flasher. Oh 
yeah, I bought an old style rotary  heater switch that should let me 
control the the power to my wiper motor. The switch in the truck is 
trashed and this was a cheap and easy way to get the voltage drop and 
switch in on swipe.

Next was a trip to Wally World. I bought some more rattle can primer 
and 12 rattle cans of flat black paint. Also bought the little 
trigger gun attatchment for spray paint cans that make it a little 
easier on your fingers. While I was passing through the white trash 
section of the auto parts I snagged some fuzzy dice and a set of 
license plate holders that are chrome with flames. Didn't get the 8 
ball flamed steering wheel cover cause it didn't look like it'd fit.

This whole shopping spree cost me almost exactly $100.

When I got home I thought i'd try a little of the flat black paint. 
Before I knew it I had sprayed 10 cans of the stuff and had got one 
good coat on the truck all the way up to the beltline. Remember...I'm 
supposed to be finishing my electrical work!

Anyway, I went ahead and brushed some phosphoric acid onto the roof 
which was apparantly in bare metal and had surface rusted quite a 
big. I also brushed some onto the bed. After it works it's magic I'll 
spray some of the primer and hit it with the flat black paint. Then 
it'll be one more good coat of flat black all the way around for a 
good solid color.

Tommarrow I'll be going out to the ranch and will snag the imperfect 
chrome emblem off the 23-window bus. I'll leave a regular paint one 
in it's place, but plan to get a new one for it one day. Also will 
get a bus tailpipe to replace the single pea shooter on the truck 
right now.

I've got a lead on a NOS set of wide white wall tires. I did some 
computer work for a friend last night and told him to get them from 
his buddy for me. He promised me he would...but we'll see. I 
definatly can't spend the cash on a new set considering the plan of 
action for this truck. So I'm really gonna bug him until I get these. 
Will have to pull the wheels off and paint them red as well.

I need a 76 antenna ball if anyone has one to donate or sell cheap. 
Also need ideas for flames or red pin striping or iron cross artwork 
or whatever. Anything cheap and cool and really white trash. All Rat 
Rod ideas appreciated.

more to come.....
