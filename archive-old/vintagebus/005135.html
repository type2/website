&quot;Nice VW! Is it for sale?&quot;
&quot;Well, sure it is for sale, everything has it's price.&quot;    
&quot;How much are you asking?&quot;     
&quot;Well, it'll cost you $11,312 in cash, plus you'll need to give me 8-
years of your spare time, roughly 6 hours per week, I'd say. After 
that there is another 2 hours per week of time in front of the PC, 
surfing vendor sites and asking questions on newsgroups. Then I'll
need another $233.17 for long distance phone charges to parts sup-
pliers and private sellers, gas to and from VW shows, parts I broke
and wrong parts that I ordered (but you can have those, I saved
them). You will also need to fix the broken window in the garage and 
assorted other damage from flying tools. You will have to get the 
acetone burns off the kitchen table and those grease stains off the 
new family room carpet (near the fireplace). Then you will need to 
somehow get my kids to unlearn six or seven swear words that they are
starting to repeat when they think I'm not around, and then you will 
need to pay my wife. You will owe her about 77 nights renting a movie
and sitting on the couch (watching but not listening to the movie, gos-
siping about friends instead), 14 &quot;quiet&quot; dinners after the kids are in
bed and some kind of compensation to her for the time we drove halfway
across Maryland on the way back from my parents after Christmas to find
that guy selling the set of barely-worn, wide whitewall Firestone 5.60
x15's (the time the kids were screaming after being in the car for 12-
hours and I refused to go straight home; ask her, she'll remember). You
will need to paint the house and take my kids to the McDonalds Playplace
about 23 times. You need to shoot hoops with my son for about 7 hours
total and go look at least 44 drawings that my daughter made.      
You will also have to call at least a dozen friends of ours and re-
arrange the dinners and cook-outs we missed (I think one event was act-
ually a wedding, you may need a suit). And you will have to go to my in-
laws on 38 Sunday afternoons for dinner (food is actually pretty good 
though). You probably should also apologize to my neighbors for the 
times I was running the compressor well past midnight.  
You will have to replace roughly 8 square inches of skin and subdermal
tissue on my body, mostly from my hands, but one big chunk right above
my eye. At least one skin graft for a severe post-welding burn will be
needed. You need to re-pay 3 of my friends somehow for favors in-
volving: sweating and swearing, and loan them at least 6 of your tools,
2 of them you may never see again. I'll need 19 T-shirts, 2 pairs of 
jeans, 5 pairs of shorts and one nice collared polo shirt (shouldn't
have been working in that one anyway!).    
You'll need to come by and disassemble the &quot;cold storage&quot; bay that I 
made for the car across the back of the garage, and take down the rack
above the garage door that is used to store the &quot;show&quot; wheels off season.
You'll have to explain to my kids that they can now ride their bikes in
the garage again and the garage doors can be opened when daddy's car is 
out of the storage space and their friend's are over. 
Still interested? Let me know. If you are, I'll stop on the way home
and buy the paint for the house.&quot; -- John Henry
