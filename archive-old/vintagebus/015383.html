I worked on other people's Barndoors, which then
either got sideswiped ('52 Panel) or they blew their

blessed or something, it's going down!

Ellis replies:
Ah, Everette never you fear, my Brother. All of my
rides have been blessed by Fr. Mulligan and insured
out the wahzoo. I have been shouting to the list and
&quot;spitting&quot; up a rope stating that the thing was
appraised at $20k which is what I have it insured for
as a stated amount policy. I would even sell it for
less if asked...
(clearing throat) IF ASKED!
Never would I suggest that a prefectly good to go, one
of 24 known to exist~ in any shape, drive it anywhere
without having search for parts, with nice paint and
new tires, turn-key, pre-2/55 VW transporter get
wrecked. Now if I parked it on the street and a City
of Phoenix dumptruck took it out I wouldnt have to
worry about the $100 million Powerball. I would own
the City's &quot;Jewels&quot; and be able to move to backwoods
Oregon or Humbolt Callyfornia and become a farmer...
Techie career my foot... ;-P
You guys keep wrecking your GreyPrimerMilitia &lt;GPM&gt;
Barndoors and mine will get more and more desirable
=)It might eventually be worth as much as a trend du
jour DD Panel or a POS project starter at a SanDiego
swapmeet...
Hey Ev, does this mean that you biffed your Kombi and 
are looking for a bus to buy?
