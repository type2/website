didn’t you buy that at Kelly Park?  I saw it drive up in the parking lot in San Jose.  Did it sell on Sunday?  BTW what is your name?

My 67 EMPI  GTV  Bug  is cool old paint with the lacquer clear coat turned 
white and flaking off.....

as the sign said &quot;barn fresh&quot;

Sometimes &quot;over restored&quot; is just not a practical ride.......
but $19,000 for a un restored Samba seems crazy..........
