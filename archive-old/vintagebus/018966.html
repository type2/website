I've done some displacement/weight calculations, and come to the
conclusion that my 250cc bike with me on it is almost exactly
equivalent to my 1300cc bus with me in it.  Interestingly enough, they
have almost identical acceleration profiles, problems with hills, and
so on.

There are several 1500-2000cc bikes out there these days.  Yes,
they're ridiculously over-powered.  They also weigh far more than any
sane person would want a bike to weigh - if it falls over, you're
gonna need a crane or several helpers to get it back up....
