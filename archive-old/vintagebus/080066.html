&gt;&gt;  I just picked up a set of armrests that have a bit of black mold on them. 
I am  wondering how one goes about cleaning this off of them?   &lt;&lt;



Hi Shawn, 
Use good old Comet and an old tooth brush to clean them.  After  rinsing 
throughly and drying apply glycerin to soften the OG vynil and after  over night 
wipe off the excess.
 
&gt;&gt; Also it looks like the best solution for the seat frames is going  to be 
powdercating them, does anyone know of a good shop here in the Tacoma  
Washington area? &lt;&lt;

Try Ken's Powdercoating near Puyallup.  Please tell them Eric&amp;Barb  said
