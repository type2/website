Subject: value needed on tranny tools that are for sale

Hi all,
It's been a long time since I posted but I kinda need some help in placing a 
value on a few swingaxle tranny tools I'm selling.

What I have is:
VW 296 - this pushes the transmission assy. out of the case.
VW 294 - gear shift test appliance (allows proper adj. of selector forks)
VW ? - tool that attaches to hockey stick to chage gears when adj. selector 
forks (used in conjunction with VW 294 above)
-extra input shaft
-extra differential
-extra swing axle tranny case
-extra nosecone

These items are all for sale and I would appreciate the help from anyone who 
knows the correct value for these parts.


Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes

VolksAuthority's shop in San Jose?
