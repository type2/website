Subject: RE: [VB] anyone going to OCTO from Boise?

Too bad you didn't mention it earlier as I think Lind went down from
last weekend to hit BOR, then Pomona, and finally the classic... he
should already be in SoCal.

... I was going to drive my firebus down but ended up getting a free
airline ticket instead since I need to be back by Monday evening.

Jason asked: 
There's a bus driver's side door (lower shell) in
Boise that I'm trying to get over here in So. Cal.
I was wondering if there's anyone from Boise or headed
through there on the way to the (June 12) OCTO show?
In return for gas money/beer/free T-shirt/wampum?
