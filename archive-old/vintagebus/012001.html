Subject: Need wheels for the '65
Date: Mon, 2 Nov 1998 10:28:35 -0600

I'm almost at the point of rolling the '65 out on it's own wheels, 
rather than the dollies. This is the first time since '93 that it will be
on it's own support.

Since I've put so much time and energy into this project, I want to 
have the best curb appeal possible. 

After the thread on tires got everybody talking, I thought maybe 
you guys can spark some inspiration on wheels as well.

I've been looking at polished 5 spoke EMPIs, polished Porsches,
American Racing 5 spoke, and about a thousand others.  I've even
looked at some from England and Germany.

My question is, what would look good on a red &amp; white '65 Deluxe, ever
so slightly lowered in the front (inch &amp; half) and back (about an inch).
The
Deluxe trim is polished and buffed, so chrome is OK, but so is paint.  Send
'em
all, I'm listening.

So tell me, what looks best on a bus?

Thanks in advance for the inputs
