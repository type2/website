&gt;When there are no numbers I assume a rebuild happened along the way. Is that 
&gt;a fair assumption? Simularly, I have seen engines with a rivet holding a tag 
&gt;with engine numbers, these are more clearly a rebuild.

I heard somewhere online, I think maybe at RAMVA or VintagVW, that
&quot;back in the day&quot;, new cases from the dealer would come with the
series letter at the beginning but no number.  This would apply to
about mid-'65 and up engine numbers, when they started putting the
letters in front of the numbers.  I think the idea was that with
the letter, future machine work and parts replacement could be done
with the right specs for that engine case.
