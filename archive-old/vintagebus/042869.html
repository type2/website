My '65 Kombi is all converted to twelve volt.  All it needs now is a good
running engine!  I replaced all the bulbs (Imean all the bulbs, even the
instrument lights!), the voltage regulator, battery and generator.  For
the wiper motor I just installed one of those 12v to 6v dropping resistors
that EMPI and other aftermarket companies offer.  The problem is that the
resistor gets extremely hot (duh, it's a resistor) and I don't want it
burning through any of the other wires under the dash.  So here's my
solution:
Mount the resistor under the front floor pan outside the bus.  That way it
has a constant flow of air over the top of it.  It seems to be water
tight.  And the ends where wires get soldered, I'd put heat shrink tubing
over the exposed wire.
If anyone has an even better (cheaper) solution for voltage dropping fro a
wiper motor, please let me know.
