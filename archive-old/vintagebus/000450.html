 Eric, should these be 90 degrees which would be a right angle, or should 
they be 180 degrees and be opposed?     Thanks      Chuck &gt;&gt;
Hi Chuck,
You really want to have them about 90 degrees apart.  VW specs for balancing 
moving engine parts are Okay, not great.  In other words they are balanced 
down to grams not down to a gnat's arse.  When the area drilled to be 
lightened it could still be heavy or light to compared to the area 180 
degrees from the drilled area.  So if you install the pressure plate 
drilled/lightened area either 180 or 0 degrees from the area of the flywheel 
you never can be sure if you have the two heavy sides of these parts aligned 
the same or not.  
   We do have one flywheel in use that has lightening/drilled areas at two 
spots about 1/3 apart from each other.  We then installed the 
lightened/driled area of the pressure plate about 1/3 from the flywheel's 
lightened/drilled areas.  Still sometimes you have to experiment to see which 
positioning of the plate works well, but for the most part the 90 degree rule 
of thumb works very well most of the time.   Eric&amp;Barb
