&gt; &gt; Hi gang:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, I give!  I've been watching this terms FLAPS in messages for some
&gt; months
&gt; &gt; now and can't quite seem to figure out what it means.  The closest I can
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; is something &quot;auto parts store&quot;.  I know this isn't critical to
&gt; &gt; understanding anyone's posting but it's beginning to &quot;bug&quot; me (no pun
&gt; &gt; intended).

&gt; I know what you're all thinking but that's all right....I never do very
&gt; well
&gt; at those before and after puzzles on Wheel either!
&gt;
&gt; Happy New Year to all and remember, the next millenium doesn't start for
&gt; another year yet!
