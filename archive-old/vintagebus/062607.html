Subject: was paint question...now...THANK YOU


The overwhelming response to my previous question in regards to helping my 
students paint my bus is greatly appreciated.

The following comments were forwarded by a fellow member of the Buskatiers, 
a bus club dedicated to camping and good times.   I feel his comments are 
worth sharing with the folks on T2 and VB.  As I am new and a bit unsure of 
posting restrictions, I hope this action is acceptable.

Thank you again for the positive thougths and feedback in regards to my 
work.  This type of feedback is worth for more than the paycheck.

I wake up every morning determined both to change the world and have one
hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.

I would suggest
having denatured alcohol available and for the paints buy rattlecans of a 
decent
acrylic in various colors + rattlecans of clearcoat. Have a good lotion 
based
hand soap and running water available for cleanup + mineral spirits for
difficult cleaning (watch for allergic skin reactions to the mineral 
spirits).
Make sure all the colors you buy contract with the current colors on the 
bus.

Also have all the supplies for a good car wash -- make a day of it.

Have the girls wash the bus good. Then, when time to paint have them wipe 
down a
section larger than their hand with denatured alcohol to remove any residual
saop and dirt. Use the rattlecan color of their choice to spray a light mist 
of
paint on their hand, and apply with firm pressure. If they smear just wash 
it
off quickly with alcohol on a rag and redo the handprint. The handprints 
should
be very thin coats on the bus that will set up quickly. About 10 minutes 
after
the handprint goes on you can spray clearcoat over it and about 3 inches 
around
it to seal it from wear. May want to repeat the clearcoat for about 4 coats
spread out over 2 or 3 days.

As soon as their print is on the bus have them hit the soap and water. If 
any of
the paint has set on their skin already wipe it down with mineral spirits
followed immediately by 2 washes with soap and water.

Using rattlecans will keep you from having to pour paint in pans for dipping
hands and will allow for thinner  coats and better defined handprints.
