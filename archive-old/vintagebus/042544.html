&gt; You can get these from any of the mail-order houses.  I've seen

&gt; ones slightly better, because they had a &quot;flat spot&quot; on one side, which
&gt; made them fit the channel better, and they have a flatter profile, so
&gt; they didn't stick up as high.  I think the rubber ones were an adaptation
&gt; of a bug part.
Or, alternately...

you can go to the hardware store and get the black self adhesive high
density rubber weatherstripping.

It is the perfect size, and it is like $3.00 for 10 feet.

I did the back hatch on my bus with less than half a roll, and i plan on
doing the cargo doors.  It'll maybe take 2 rolls.

I got this tip from the DBG, and it will save me big bucks so im very
happy :)

take care,

Steve
