&lt;&lt; Anyone ever have any experience with oil slinging past the oil slinger
 washer, hitting the pulley and making a nice mess of the motor? &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Look for a blockage in the breather system (the hose connecting the oil
filler to the air cleaner). If this is plugged, the crankcase pressure will
force oil out past the slinger and make a lovely mess all over the engine
compartment.&gt;&gt;
Hi Guys,
Excellent ansewer, but it only deals with the symptoms not the cause.  If
Powell is finding an oil water foam mixture on the under side of the oil
filler cap and this in turn has clogged the breather tube then his engine is
not getting up to proper operating temperture.  This can be due to not having
the thermostatic bellows and flaps system installed and/or driving less than
a half hour in cold weather at a time here and there.  If Powell is not
interested in installing a thermostatic bellows and/or can not make his
drives longer so the engine oil heats up to at least 160 F.  Then he should
at the least change his oil every 1,500 miles or three months during cold
weather or expect a shorter engine life due to not only water in his oil, but
raw gasoline which turns oil into acid.  Which even when the engine is run at
proper tempertures is the big reason one changes the oil every 3,000 miles or
6 months which ever comes first or the oil turns into acid.  Eric&amp;Barb

PS To remove the oil foam from the breather tube it is best to pour boiling
water into the tube with it off the engine.  Oh, and by the way that would be
to the front of the pulley that the oil is leaking out not the rear. EEE&amp;B
