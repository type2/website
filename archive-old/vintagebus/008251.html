I was leaving work yesterday and lo-and-behold a Single Cab passed right
in front of me.  After I did a double-take, I pulled out and followed it,
noticing a 3rd brake light decklid, small-but-empty taillight holes and
uncut rear wheel wells.  It was also loaded with welding equipment and a
scary home-made truck rack with ladders on it, obviously the guy's work
vehicle.  I followed him, of course, my mind swimming with the idea of a
cheap, running SC purchase, but lost him at a stop light.

So, I was trying to figure out what year the 3rd brake light stopped.  Was
it '57?  I couldn't see semaphores, in case that makes a difference, but I
couldn't get up beside him due to traffic.

My guess was the SC was a '56...

Thanks,
Everett
'54 SC
