Subject: Re: [VB] Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

Hi Lars,
  We would not know if the Bus Boys IRS conversion kit is a complete bolt on. 
 We never found the need for IRS ourselfs, and prefer the simplictiy of the 
swingaxle!
Not sure what you mean by &quot;bolt size&quot;.  To put an IRS suspension you need 
diagonal support to the trailing arms to prevent the rear wheels from push/pulled 
sideways and tearing the CV joints apart when going through turns/curves.  
  As for the engine compartment the early upright engine is about 28&quot; wide 
and the type 4 pancake engine is about 36&quot; wide.  You do the math!
  Plus from what we understand from others the type 4 tranny is longer than 
the earlier trannies so that would push the engine out the back of the early 
bus by a few inches!  Whoops!
