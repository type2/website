That thing's as ugly as a sack of smashed a$$h*les. I would drive a lowered
412 before I would let one of those mutant Hondas darken my driveway. How
anyone could pony up the price of a couple of restored buses to be the
millionth on their block.....

&gt; Buy a &quot;new bus&quot; and what do you get?  The privelege of being the first
&gt; on the block for maybe a month, then 5 years of payments.  After 5 years
&gt; what do you have?  Just another $2500 car.
