I'm fixing to install a piece of aluminum deluxe trim on the rear hatch.  
I'm having a problem with it, because I need to drill each hole out for it 
(the gate is not stock deluxe).
Now for my question.  The holes on the either end of the trim are right on 
the edge...this means that when I drill the holes in the gate for them, the 
will stick out and hit the seal when the door closes.  I hope that makes 
sense?
Anyway, if I could get an answer more clear than my question, I would be 
appreciative.
Thanks,
