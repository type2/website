&gt; i know that he has been mentioned before, but Tom Conners near Spokane
&gt; Washington(Dear Park) makes really nice racks-metal and wood. i bought one
&gt; this summer and was very impressed. They are strong and look really good.
He
&gt; makes ladders as well and is so nice to work with. i was in a time crunch
&gt; and ordered one with two weeks notice and i went through his town and
picked
&gt; up - the rack was awesome-and he had painted it for me!!! he wasn't going
to
&gt; have time because of my short notice, but he did because he knew i was on
my
&gt; way across the country and didn't have time to to do it myself. great
&gt; guy-great product at a good price. i paid $365 for a six foot long wood
slat
&gt; rack. you can find them cheaper, but you never know what you're going to
&gt; get. if you want more info i think i still have his number.
