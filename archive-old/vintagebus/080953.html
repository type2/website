&gt; got the bottom left one off, now i just need to get the other three off.... all

Hello Josh  Well if it is a 40hp then you are wasting your time as the heads 
wont work on a 1600.  Let me know if you need some heads I have a shelf full 
of them.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
