Subject: Headliner glue

Hello.....My first job before doing anything else on my 65 is to take all of
the old interior panels off and try taking headliner down as well. That
headliner material is pretty tuff wherever it has been glued (around window
frames and upper portion of the interior..... I've been scraping it off but
lots of it stays on and there's so much glue left I just don't know what to
do with it...... I think there should be something that has been used to
remove that goo..... what is it? any ideas?

Thanks,

Dre
