just curious Eric.....how can you stand to go from:
&quot;an *original* unrestored westy in very good condition&quot;
 ....to....
&quot;71 pan (for the irs), ghia disk brakes, set of Porsche alloys, full velour
interior, filled dash with custom vdo gauge set&quot; ?

Besides the fact that its free or cheap, It seems like a very big change
that I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy, even if he wasn't a vintage
nazi :)
