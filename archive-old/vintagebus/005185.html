Subject: Engine Stud Pattern???
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2000 09:13:03 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Last night I was out in the shop until after 1:00a.m. and am late for work
as I type this.  Like Otto Lillienthal said, &quot;Sacrifices must be made.&quot; :-)

I used the wire wheel on every engine stud, painstakingly removed every case
saver that had come out with the stud, and managed to get half-way done
running a die up and down each set of threads on each stud before I simply
got too tired and had to turn in.

The trouble is that during the cleaning process, I lost the order in which
the studs go in the case.  It appears that there are 2 or 3 different
lengths of cylinder studs so I was wondering if anyone can tell me which
ones go where?  I want to get it right the first time so that when I go to
put the heads on, I don't end up pulling stuff back off because I installed
them wrong.

Any advice/web pages/references would be appreciated.  Thanks!
