&gt; I have a question about the external oil-cooler idea.  Bernie Bergman has a

&gt; 
&gt; At warm-up, oil is routed from the pump to the external filter and
&gt; back...when temps hit 180, the valve opens, and oil is routed through the
&gt; external cooler.  And then, when temps reach 190, the switch triggers an
&gt; electric fan which moves heat-laden air away from the external cooler.  This
&gt; was my idea, by the way... ; )
&gt; 
&gt; Any experience or thoughts about these systems?  I know there are those who
&gt; attest that a properly maintained VW  won't overheat, but when you sit in
&gt; traffic, your heads are cool (the forced air cools heads nicely), but the
&gt; oil always seems to get hotter....more hotter than I'd like, anyway!

The VW oil cooling system is a very elegant self-regulating system.  The
level of oil cooling is controlled by the viscosity of the oil.  If the
oil is thick, then the flow is bypassed around the cooler.

Bergmann's add-on system should work OK, but the added level of
complexity is unwelcome.  If it keeps the oil cool, the flow through the
stock cooler will remain small, so the stock cooling system will act as
though the engine never warms up.

&gt; Also,
&gt; when travelling in rarefied air, there is less of that air there to conduct
&gt; heat away from your engine.  Airplanes have to adjust prop pitch and speed
&gt; for altitude, why should we think that our air-cooled engines don't have
&gt; similar issues?

Well, at higher altitudes the engine makes less power, which makes less
heat to get rid of with the same fin area.  Less mass airflow will
probably just balance with the lesser heat.
