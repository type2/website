We would like to thank everyone who has checked out 
http://volkswagenhomebrew_dot_com/ in the past few weeks since it has been up. 
We have had so many people asking for parts hard to keep up with all the 
e-mails we are getting and trying to fill peoples request right away. If we 
have not got back to you about a part you requested don't worry we will get 
back with you. We are in the process of moving everything to a new shop 
soon.  At this new shop we will have more room to work on buses getting them 
ready to be sold, parted out or fixed. We will also be more up to date with 
what parts we have after the move.

We still have many Volkswagens that still need to be posted on the site. 
Working on the site has also been slow since our free time has been taken up 
by preparing for the move. Thanks again everyone for checking out our site.

Dan and Brian
