&gt; I just assumed that extra cable was a choke cable... I wasn't sure exactly 
&gt; when they did away with the manual choke.  I'll have to crawl under there

&gt; right of the regular heat control...so I assume there is a cable behind it 
&gt; :)  The gas gauge is in german though...I think.  Its not English.

Hi Isaiah,
It is for the 211 209 021 E fuel tap AKA reserve switch.  Since your chassi 
number is 7786XX it is well inside the Chassi No. 20-117 902 thru 802 985 
range for the reserve switch as a standard item on all non-ambulance models.
