&lt;&lt; FM in 61?  &quot;ships at sea&quot; maybe, FM, I doubt it. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
FM radio has been around since the late 1940s!  Check out this website for 
all sorts of radios for VWs from WWII to the 70s: gutefahrt_dot_com

PS If the radio is actually from 1961 or earlier and looks clean it probably 
is worth $100.00 even not working.  EEE&amp;B
