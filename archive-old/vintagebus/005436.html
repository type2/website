Does anyone know if I need idle stops for these carbs?  I've got the Berg
linkage and initially was planning to rely on the linkage to set the idle
but I'm afraid that time and wear will make this all but unreliable
eventually and I'll end up wearing a groove in the venturi from the
butterfly hitting it.

A call to Fast Freddy's said that for $20, I could be sent a couple of
levers for THEIR linkage that have the idle stops but this won't work with
the Berg linkage I would assume.  From pictures in various publications,
I've seen a fancy lever with a spring loaded type of stop and even a few
setups that aren't running the idle stops at all.  The problem with making
your own is that the idle stop lever will hit the linkage UNLESS you use a
spring loaded type of deal where you dial the idle lever in but it doesn't
swivel with the throttle at all.  It merely acts as a physical stop for the
throttle lever (if that makes any sense.)

Anyone got any ideas to help me out?
