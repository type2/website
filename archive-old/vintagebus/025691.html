Sez Eric&amp;Barb:

&gt; He says it is for a 1968 and later.  In other words he probably does not know
&gt; what year it really is for.  Wants $550.00 for it.

Hard to tell with the loaf tents unless you can find the date stamp on
the floor.  There were at least two styles of that era's add-a-room, and
all will fit splitties through '80, AFAIK.  The price is average-to-high
IF it's in fine shape and has all the bags, poles, etc.
