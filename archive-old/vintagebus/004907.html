&gt; they did use auto tarns in bugs.  starting in 69 it was available.  These
are
&gt; IRS, meaning a whole different axle configuration than the swing axle bus.
&gt; Also you have a wierd oil pump that pumps stuff for the auto trans.
&gt;
&gt; I have driven an auto trans bug a few times, but cannot say I would ever
be
&gt; tempted to do this to a bus.  However, it could be done, though it would
be
&gt; more work than a straightforward tranny swap, if you really want it
&gt; automatic.

Nah, use the Type 3 automatic. Still an IRS conversion, but the Type 3 is a
full automatic and is robust as hell. You will need the tranny, the flex
plate (flywheel) and a source for a vacuum signal. It doesn't use the weird
oil pump of the autostick bugs and is a way better auto-tranny than the one
in bay buses. Have no idea whether you could switch out the r/p and side
covers for a swingaxle setup, maybe. Why anyone would want to go to all this
trouble for an auto in a bus is beyond me. Buy an old Honda instead.
