Greetings,

   I'm doing some reconstructive surgery on the nose of a bus right now
and have a question reqgarding holding on a panel for welding.  I'm using
the alan panel nose set(numbers 2 and 3 - upper and lower valance) and so
far the fit has been completely amazing.  I took a donor lower v nose and
welded that into the section on the upper piece that is missing
from the alan panel.  Now the problem arises: What ways are their to hold
the upper part of the panel to butt weld it together with the lower nose
of my bus?  I wish to make it as seemless as possible, but I don't know
how to get that to fit exactly into place(when I clamp it in, it isn't
bent totally correct, so I'll have to do some adjustments).  Do you guys
use rivets and then weld the small holes up later? Do you use clamps from
eastwood? Any advise would be great!  

Also, remember when you do this(if you're so unlucky to have to!) that you
should tac on an additional metal strip on the upper part of the lower
nose peice that is missing in the alan set. This makes it look
factory.  The strip he provides will just bend over the top of the upper
section. 

In other news: I just got a blaster, which is a hoot.  I -must- get my
water seperation system in because the air is so moist it makes for spotty
blasting and I end up having to unclog it from time to time(which is a
lot!).  But still, I love it and couldn't be happier with the
results(well, both happy and sad).  I'm happy because when I used walnut
shells, which just take off a slim layer of paint at a time, you can find
shiny and unrusted metal.  On the other hand i'm sad because I've found
more bondo, which was so well done the first time I couldn't
tell! Rats. Nevertheless, its an easy fix.  Now I need to get some of that
#80 garnet and get to work on the rusty stuff.  

A lot of work, but a lot of fun(does this make me insane?)
