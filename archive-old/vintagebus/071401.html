Subject: Re: [VB] early vs late push button doors?

&gt; Can anyone tell me the specific differences between a
 67 door and one from, say, 65?

 I need a driver's side cab door for my 67, and located
one from a 64 (?). Other than the missing speed nuts
to mount the pull handle along the top in the
doorpanel holes, what about the latch? I've heard 67
was a one-year only latch.
 __________________________________

If 64 and 65 are the same as 66, then no, a 67 door latch will not work.

They may fit but they will not latch correctly.
The latches are different. The catches are different. The hole in the door where the latches are are
different.
They will not be flush when you mis-match them.
Here are pics of 66 latches and catches:

Here are pics of 67 latches and catches:

The 66 catch is held on with 3 screws. 67 is 2.
The pin on the 66 catch sits in farther then the 67.
The latch on the 66 is in farther than the 67.
You can put a complete 66 door on a 67 but the door will not be flush with the B pillar. And you cannot adjust
it far enough to be flush.....BTDT.
