Subject: Thom's Paint Blob

Thom, and to think you thought MY yellow and blue
ex-bus was hideous.  Think about my bus with yellow
on yellow, rather than the tasteful Michelin colors
of Yellow over Midnight Blue.

A yellow vision, yes, of what I don't know, and people
thought mine was highly visible!  Yours will glow
during the dark and stormy night, Rudolf will be on
the unemployment line, people with H4's will blind
themselves with the reflection, you won't even need
lights, just use the light from others, or the moon,
or the stars, bouncing off you, I think you get the drift.

I just hope you don't go for the black on black on
black interior like the PO did on mine, that was a
bit too much.

A ketchup red interior!  That's the ticket,
vintagebus.bun the theme.


Anybody seen my ex-bus in the Hayward (SF bay) area?
Like described, ya ca't miss it!  Last I heard the
engine had a huge oil leak.

BTW, Thom, I have a few rattle cans of BRIGHT YELLOW
from different makers that might match yours left over
from ones that didn't quite match mine.
