Subject: What sort of gear oil

Hi bussers,

All this talk about gear oil, it's about time I bit the bullet and changed
mine. My book says use SAE90 oil, but all I can find in the shops is 90LS
(limited slip, I guess) and 80W90. Will the 90LS be a problem?

What about these magic additives (like teflon et al.). I'm sure there are
religious wars over whether they work or not, but my question is: will they
actually HARM the tranny and/or redux boxes?

Keep on bussin,
