Subject: Re: [VB] Correct tire size?

Hi,

I run P205-75R's on my 15&quot; wheels. The speedo is bang on when I time
it against the highway mile markers. I know there has been a lot of
discussion on the list as to what is the correct tire to use on a bus.
You may want to take a look at the archives and see those discussions.
Also keep in mind that the panels are rated for an 1800 pound max.
load. Make sure your tires are rated for the weight of the bus plus
whatever load you are expecting to carry.

Chris
