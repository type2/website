I opened my owner's manual and read that Kabayo said:
&gt;I bid on a set of bus mud flaps and won.  Not so cheap - $30+
I paid promptly.

This guy is in business, but doesn't seem to be familiar with one of the
most basic aspects of the law: You can't try to sell what you don't own.
&gt;
So you say it's not cheap and he offers to let you out of the deal and your
path
is not clear?  Obviously they are available somewhere cheaper...
