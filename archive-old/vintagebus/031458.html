Hi Ron and all you old timers on the VB list.
Last time I pmailed Ron on the last hire go round...
Something about being over qualified??? Things have changed...
It looks as if things go as planed, I will have a Employment gap until 
January. I'd love to spend it in a bus related job.
Are you up for a long explanation of my current situation? Here goes:
I'm broke in Hawaii.
yeah yeah in know; boo hoo! Poor beach bum... I'm, ah, between careers.
I learned Navapache Regional Medical Center in Show Low, AZ
is looking for new tech.s. They approached me with the idea to get 
my National Certificate through a Med. tech Certification program
starting in the Spring of '02. (hence the wait / gap in work)
They would sponsor my schooling, in return, I would agree to work 
for them; 30K salery... woohoo! Think of all the VW parts I could buy. 
They scheduled me for 3 days with hotel and car thrown in.
I fly out of  Honolulu on the 10th of September. My interview is/ 
are on the 11th and 12th and I fly out of Phoenix on the 13th... 
I could on the mainland and catch the bus to CA (or PA) 
and look for work rather than returning to Honolulu.
My Kombi is in storage in Coalinga, California, (near Fresno) 
You may remember from the list on new year's 1998-99 My dove blue 61
Kombi threw a rod as I was on the last hill going north into Tucson. 
I was coming back to the west Coast after finishing school in Florida.
I was able to obtain a new motor at Chirco Automotive and install 
it in the bus using a church's parking lot. 
(On New Years Eve, what fun!) 
So you see, I've got some travel experience in a Bus... 
loaf and split; all with upright motors. 
Here's a resume:
