When issssaha first bought that seat I offered him 450$ (based on what 
previous DD seats had sold for, I'm sure deasterwood would agree that that is 
the &quot;going rate&quot;).
I mean, DD busses are cool and all but, who wants them?
I have a single cargo door in my 57, and boy do those things like to rattle, 
imagine two!
And when I slam on my brakes, I'd have TWO sides of the middle seat to come 
flopping forward.
Not to mention more hinges to smack while driving, more doors to 
lock/rekey/ect.
I'm still looking for the walk through panel with NO DOORS aside form the cab.
Now that would be a bus!

&lt;&lt; My comment was not directed at the seller in the auction...  it was 
directed at the bidders...  they were either &quot;bigshot&quot; resellers or 
even worse, they were people who asked the seller what the reserve 
was and bid just under the reserve so they could &quot;look&quot; like bigshots 
ready to buy the rarest of the rare.  The egos and &quot;my d*ck is 
bigger than yours&quot; part of the VW bus scene really detracts from 
most people's enjoyment...

Anyone who thinks this particular auction was anything less than a 
joke has no sense of humor.  The bigger joke however is all the people 
who see these auction prices and then believe that is the &quot;going rate&quot; 
for goods and the asking prices at swap meets keep climbing and 
climbing.

Jokes CAN be funny...  but the whole &quot;buying/selling&quot; scene has been 
f*cking hilarious the last few years.  Enjoy things while you can, 
things are going to get worse before they get better.
