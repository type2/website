Subject: case savers installation

Hi all, renoir here.

1600 dualport,71.

Just before I took a 2300 mile trip to the redwoods, I pulled the engine to
add an external oil cooler.
At the same time I tourqued the head bolts.
One and one only of the shafts began turning in the case; I stopped right
there. All other shafts were ok.

Mechanically, trip went smooth, no problems. In the last month or so, it
seems as if there is space growing between the head, cylinders,or case?
It is hard to start when cold, seems to have lost a little power, and I
think I hear a thud noise on start-up but runs smooth when warm.

Checked the library for case saver installation, no cigar.


What would be the process for installing a case saver? What if I pulled out
the offending head bolt shaft, smeared it with JB weld, and stuck it back
in? I wonder how long that would last?

thanks all

renoir
