&gt; I remember quite a while ago on either the vintagvw list or type2 list that
&gt; there was a discussion about putting new clips on old VW 5 lug rims.  I can
&gt; recall someone stating that a regular pop rivet gun would not do the trick -
&gt; that you had to have some special tool to do it correctly.

The clips were originally riveted on using a special tool made for the
job.  It's just a rather substantial chunk of steel that's mostly conical,
has a base that can be clamped between the jaws of a vise, a small
indentation on the top to hold the rivet and a cutout on the side to
accomidate the clip itself.  Confused?  Here: I've scanned an image from
the Big Blue Bentley that mostly illustrates the tool:

Use it to follow the above description, and you should be golden.  

Richard Troy pulled one of these out at last week's Karmann Ghia Club
meeting, and it was almost identical to the one in the picture, though
perhaps just a little longer.  

Laters!
