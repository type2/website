Well I got home last night after purchasing the only barn door crew cab I
have ever herd of, it is a 54 and it looks totally complete. I picked it up
from a farmer just out side of Logan UT. It has Cal plates with 62 tabs. I
am having it put on flat bed and it should be heading this way by the first
of next week. I am having it delivered to Buffalo Restorations for a
complete ground up going through. I will have pictures of it after it is
delivered (damn digital camera I brought didn't have a charged battery!!!)
and will post them to Thom's site.
I realize just how much of a score this is, that is why I am going to let
the &quot;professionals&quot; do the resto on this one.
