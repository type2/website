To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I had my 57 loaded 4 feet high and the entire 9 feet of the roof rack FILLED 
on the way back from seattle last year.
I couldn't break 35 Miles per hour the ENTIRE trip through Oregon, but 3.5 
cylinders on a leaky 36 wasnt exactly a good power plant!!!!!
I averaged about 8 miles per gallon on the way home (As opposed to 32 MPG on 
the way there!!!!!!!)
26 hours of driving and I made it 800 miles landing me smack dab in downtown 
Sacramento!!!!!!!! I think it was time for a nap about then.
Nope, I kept on trucking heading down to L.A., Made it to bakersfield when i 
could no longer keep my eyes opened.
Decided it was time to pull over and take a short nap, I woke up 12 hours 
later by the sound of a semi-truck pounding down the road!!!!!!
Hey I made it, 35 MPH, but I made it!
Ahhh, the bulletproof 36!

&lt;&lt;I Know that when I cruise my bug with the rack there is a small lose of 
power 
with it on, almost not noticeable. I have heard of full length racks taking a 
mile per gallon away on a bus. Word of warning I have run my rack on my bug 
loaded with junk and it does create a BIG wind drag. I mean my bug could not 
break 55 MPH fully loaded rack, it wasn't the weight just the wind drag.
