&gt; What's the M tag have for options?? Maybe this will help determine what this

               425 002(???) 025 130(no sunroof or roof windows)

            No indication above that it was prepared for Westfalia, but if
it were a deluxe, vw might not have changed anything before it was sent to
Westy? Also, does anyone know what M-code 002 is?

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hi list,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there such a thing as a Westy factory done SO-42 w/ pop top in a
&gt; Deluxe?
&gt;&gt; I recently purchased an original paint '65 13 window deluxe off of
&gt; Everett's
&gt;&gt; site which has what looks to us like a very well done poptop.  It has a
&gt; very
&gt;&gt; clean roof rolled &quot;curb&quot; like other original Westy pop tops, and the
&gt;&gt; original Deluxe headliner is still in place! All the SO-42 interior is in
&gt;&gt; place and it seems to be a '65 vintage kit w/ clam shell lights, etc.  Is
&gt;&gt; this a very well done hack job, or a rare factory job on a complete
&gt; Deluxe?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; TIA
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Tom Buese,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 63 DC
&gt;&gt; 65 Deluxe Westy?
