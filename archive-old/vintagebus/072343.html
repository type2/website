Hey Guys   I use both plastic and glass.  bi filter I guess. I have seen the 
glass ones unscrew and fall apart, not what you want, also have seen them 
short the coil / points by being too close to the coil . Haven't seen too many 
failures with the old cheap plastic filters. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
