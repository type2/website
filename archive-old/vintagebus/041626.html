I had forgotten last month when reading the first half of the captivating
story of Brian in the snow how much I was tweaked when it said 'to be
continued...' arrrgggg i mailed cletus to tell him what a great story it
was and thant I couldnt wait for the rest. well I completely forgot about
it until I opened up the Mr T issue. Wow what a good VW story.
