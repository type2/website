Subject: FS - Costco Shed


I just submitted my plans for a permit to build my new garage,
and won't be needing the Cozmo tarp-shed setup anymore.  The
existing panels are toast, but the poles are in good shape.  It
comes with brand new (NOS!) panels and NOS dingleberries to attach
them.  It was almost $200 for the new panels!  Also - it comes with
an extra end panel (NOS!) so that you can fashion a door.

I'm in the Sacramento area and can deliver locally.

New, I think they're $175, when they have them in stock.  Make a reasonable
offer.

I also have some other various bus parts FS that I'll be liquidating
over the next couple of weeks - I have to pay for this garage somehow!

Thom
