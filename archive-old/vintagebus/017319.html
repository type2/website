[This is not as coherent as I'd like.  It's been a really long and
frustrating day...]

I have a 1960 Standard that came in on the gray market.  This means,
among other things, that it originally had the Euro-spec electrical
system (i.e., semaphores), and the dealer converted it to meet US
requirements (i.e., blinkers).

Since I got it, the rear blinkers, brake lights, and running lights
have all been pretty dim.  Today I went in to clean up all the
contacts and see what, if any, improvement that would give me.  On the
good side, I now have much brighter rear lights.  On the bad side, my
blinkers are really confused.  Everything works as it should for a
left turn indication.  For a right turn, however, I get both right-
side blinkers and the left rear blinker as well.

I can't really say if this was happening before I did anything or
not.  Everything was so dim that it might have been blinking both
rears for one direction or the other, and I just couldn't tell.

One oddness I found was that there are two black w/red wires at the
right rear.  Originally, it looked like one went to the turn/brake
filament, and the other was joined with the running light filament
wires.  All of the wires were badly frayed, so I clipped them off,
stripped off new sections, and (I thought) put everything back where
it came from.  That's when problems started.  

After having played around with all the possible permutations of the
wires in that corner, what I've got now is one black w/red
disconnected, one connected to the turn/brake filament, and the
running light wires going to that filament.  This gives the results
described above, and is the least-dysfunctional of all the variations
I could find.

At the front of the bus, I found what looks to be a dealer-installed
pair of relays, which appear to be some sort of officially-approved
conversion kit for achieving US-spec lighting while still using the
Euro-spec turn signal switch.  The switch powers one of the two
relays.  That relay, in turn, operates the lights on its side of the
bus - there's a terminal for each light (just like on the US turn
signal switch), and inputs for the turn and brake switches.  However,
the wiring was done in whatever was handy (solid yellow and solid
black), and it's not clear where we join back into the original
harness (i.e., I couldn't find the splices).  So, given that the wires
I've got at the front are black and yellow, and the wires I've got at
the back are black w/red (all three of them), I'm having trouble
figuring out how it's supposed to work.

Has anyone dealt with one of these conversions before, such that they
can tell me what the changes are relative to the diagram at Thom's web
site?

Thanks.
