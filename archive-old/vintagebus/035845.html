&lt;&lt; * flanging the panel  then punching holes in the repair panel overlap
 then spotting the panel on then grinding for finishing (rust forming
 between overlap?) &gt;&gt;
I use this method on all sorts of cars everyday, but I do use weld thru
primer.  This is also the way I-Car recommends.  Just be sure to bevel your
holes before spot welding, makes for a stronger weld.
   Peace, Love, and if it's good enough for I-Car it's good enough for me,
