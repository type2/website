I really like that 63, but have a feeling it would be way too rich for my
blood...

Believe it or not a few weeks ago, i was thinking how much fun it would be
to mount a PA horn at each corner of my roof rack and blare music
sometimes, and other times &quot;talk to&quot; whatever person is tailgaiting me at
the moment...  Or maybe drive around neighborhoods spouting political
&quot;the aliens have taken over congress&quot; type things... to give us bus folk a
better image as socially active citizens ;)

I went so far as to plan out a quick disconnect system, and tell people of
my plans both for the PA system and rack mount front and rear pointing
driving lights, for tailgater dissuasion and better visibility. (you
should have seen the looks on their faces..) 

take care,

Steve
