great thumbnail!

the sundial is #72.

Well, I thought we'd of heard from the folks at the transporter
speculation...uh I mean restoration shops by now, but they must be too busy
counting their coin.  For all of you who were at BBBV, those of us at home and
were board could check out the auction on speedvision. 

19K for a sundial??  I thought we were heading into a recession?

For what its worth I don't think this is good for the hobby... out of my
control though.  Enjoy.
