&gt; Harry, you saw my scoop the first time you saw my Westy at the open 
&gt; house at &quot;EMPI&quot; several years ago, remember?  You asked what is that

Yup, and I saw the same type of scoop on Nate's black bus. I think he 
had a flat T4 motor with a scoop to the rear fan shroud. He's up in the 
Seattle area last I heard. Remember his aircraft grade aluminum teardrop 
single wheel trailer? Hello Nate!

BTW for the sweltering AZ folks. I'm way behind on my BackCooler 
project. Hope to line up the non-patented ducks for next year. Clearing 
the decks as they used to say.
