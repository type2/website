&gt; Thought it was
&gt; &gt; quite cool that the hub cap has ridden in 2 of the remaining 17 Binz.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone please tell this poor Brit what a Binz is? How is it different
&gt; to what we call a Crew Cab (double cab)?

A Binz is a coachbuilt doublecab.  In the early days of production, VW
only built singlecabs, then farmed them out to the Binz company to be
converted to doublecabs.  Binzes are the Holy Grail of VW buses.

If you look very closely at the letterbox version, you can see a binz
parked outside Castle Anthrax  :)
