Well, this isn't Friday, but then again this isn't a
normal (whatever that is) week. I'd say that everybody
in the USA believes in their right to personal
privacy. Unfortunately, the vast majority believe that
right is exclusive and they have the right to stick
their noses into everybody elses privacy. So, with
apologies to Janis Joplin, privacy is just another
word for nothin' left to hide.

&gt; Good people should not have to

&gt; coats busting down their doors.    

I doubt there are many doors to bust down at a
campsite at Burning Man, or any other campground for
that matter. Discreetly indulging in a smoke behind
the closed doors of one's house will unlikely,
although it is possible, result in being busted.
Indulging in a public area is another story. The rules
of the game are very clear, getting busted or hassled
is not a worry, rather an expectation. So until it is
legalised (which will never happen, it would deal too
severe a blow to the California agricultural industry,
not to mention lessen the need for law enforcement and
the taxation to support it) one can only choose to
take risk and accept consequences.
