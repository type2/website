Hi,

T minus 48:00:00 and counting. EveryBus the official Type2_dot_campout is just
around the corner. The gathering will be April 16,17,18 and held at
Hagan-Stone Park just south of Greensboro, NC

We have reserved an entire camping loop . Each of the  41 sites has electric
and water hookups as well as a picnic table. The cost is $12.00 per
ite( one vehicle and 4 campers) per night. You can fit two buses in a site
but the park will charge an extra $12.00. There are also sites available in
the tent loop or the other RV loop if you would prefer. We will be in the C
loop which also offers a picnic shelter with 10 tables and a
fireplace/grill. There is also a community fire ring in our loop so bring a
log or two to toss on the fire. No pallets please!!!!

Friday come early and get a good spot!

Friday night relax and watch the buses roll in.

Saturday afternoon (about 1:00pm)  a carabus will leave the campground to
pay a call on Kelly Brown (aka MetWiz) at his shop to check out the bus
repairs he is currently working on:1957 23w, 1958 hardtop deluxe,1963
panel/camper and Kelly's 67 westy.

Saturday night there will be door prizes and a bonfire.

Bring an instrument and join the Dave Martin EveryBus Band!

Sunday morning the carabus to Farmington (IVWA show/swaps/drags) will leave
when enough people have their act together :)&gt;

If you would like to donate a door prize contact Judy at jnvw_at_aol_dot_com or see
her at EveryBus in the green 65 poptop Westy.
