&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; The thing is that these are listed as coming soon.....  So that probably

Considering the other &quot;innovative&quot; stuff advertised on that page
(headlight strobes, blue H4 bulbs, etc.), I'd be leery of the quality of
the items.  This stuff seems to be in the &quot;novelty&quot; category intended for
the &quot;Way Kool Dewd&quot; crowd who aren't all that interested in longevity.
