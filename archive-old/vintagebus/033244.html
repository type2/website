&lt;&lt; fresh air vent-  box sits on top above cab-  look at &quot;a week at he

 so this last one would be barndoor only, as it was standard as of 3/55 to 
have a fresh air vent.     &gt;&gt;

OK, so this is definitely a barndoor only option.  What's the M-code (option 
code) for it?  Like I said, I'd like to compile a list of Barndoor only 
options codes and what they are.
