Hi Oliver,

I dont know that I can help but I am traveling to Germany soon.  Are these
parts large or would they fit in my luggage?  I am not sure if this would
help save any $ because most VW parts houses are in California and I live in
Chicago, so you would have to have them shipped here first, but if they are
smaller items then maybe I could save you the freight an time wasted over
the &quot;big pond&quot;.  And I dont know what part of Germany you live in.  If I can
help let me know.

Do you know of and VW aircooled shows in Northern Germany during Aug?  I
need a diversion from EXPO2000.  :-)

Thanks.
