&gt;Sure you have the correct year shoes?  '64+ are

&gt;  Make sure the tongues

64 and up shoes would not even fit in the space of the
earlier adjusters/cylinders/backing plates, because
the diameter is about 1&quot; different.
Also, the drum would not fit on if the (correct) shoes
were not seated, because they would stick out of the
cylinders too much. 
Based on the pic, everything looks ok, at least as far
as installation of the shoes. I agree that the shoes
may not be seated correctly vertically and may need
up/down adjustment. Maybe another set of shoes could
be tried. I have seen shoes from the same manufacturer
that were slightly thicker/thinner, enough to make the
difference of a drum turning or not. If trying
different shoes is not an option, you may try taking
the edge of the shoe, the tab part that fits in the
adjuster, and take it to a bench grinder or a good
flat file and remove a slight bit of metal from the
edge (but keep the same contour). This may be
*ILLEGAL* though if a shop were to do it. I had to do
this in an emergenty once and it works fine. Only
remove metal from the tab that fits in the adjuster
though.
But what's all thes anti-turning drum sentiment? Early
front drums are plenty thick to have them turned to
the TURNING DIAMETER (NOT THE MAX DIAMETER). It IS a
VW (and every other auto manufacturer as
well)specified repair as well. If I understood
correctly from the initial post that the shoes had
rusted/fused to the drums, more than likely a light
sanding won't take care of it. And driving on (what I
am gathering) severely pitted/rusted shoes is a real
good way to destroy brake shoes real fast, and not
much else. If you can run your finger over the braking
surface of the drum, from the inside to the outside,
and feel ridges, bumps, gouges, etc, if you don't have
the drums resurfaced, you're wasting your time and
brake shoe money. There will be drastically reduced
braking surface, irregular wear to the shoes, possible
pulling to the side when braking, etc. Have the drums
checked. Turn them if they are re-useable. Get others
if not. Good used ones are not THAT hard to find,
especially with people changing to later front ends,
putting dropped disc brakes on, etc. Do it right the
first time. It's your life, and maybe others, that you
are dealing with. I would rather stomp on the brakes,
knowing I'm gonn stop straight and securely, rather
than wondering if that $20 bucks I saved was worth it
as I swerve into a ditch, plow into a car, off a cliff,...
