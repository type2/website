I don't think I've ever seen one leak.  I've seen leaks around where
they screw in, from someone having re-used the crush washer, but
that's user error.  (For the pedantic, I'm referring to the flat soft-
metal washer like on the drain plate studs, not rounded like the drain
plug washer; it's still a crush washer due to soft metal and
using the deformation to form a seal).
