&lt;&lt; any ideas for area VW graveyards.... &gt;&gt;

Hello,

You might try 'Bry's' in west Seattle.  His address and phone
number is:  4017 W. Marginal Way SW -and- 206/938-3868.

Be forewarned!  While the herd has thinned out somewhat these
last few years, there are still a lot of 'dingleberries' working at
Bry's.  Don't expect a straight answer should you call and ask
if they have a certain part on hand.  You'll have to go and see
for yourself.  Also, even up here in VW-heaven, good salvageable
splitty Type IIs are getting mighty hard to find in the boneyards.

Good luck!
