&gt;   I'm sticking to the sealed bid

&gt; I've also had a few suggestions to call the site &quot;V-Bay&quot; and &quot;VW-Bay&quot; -
&gt; whadday think?

Do what you will....not my site... but you asked.
Aren't you trying to get away from E-bay??  Isn't that what inspired you to make
this site up in the first place?  Why would you name it after, or have that
sites name, in your sites name?  There is so much talk about how much everyone
hates e-bay...but yet people are addicted to it.  Would you hate stabbing
yourself in the eye with a pencil?  I don't think you'd find that
enjoyable...and I don't see anyone shoving pencils in their eyes...  makes me
wonder...

&quot;Hey...did you guys see that DD middle seat up on ebay going for $xxxx???, I
wonder what kind of an ass would put that up.   oh yeah...and ebay sucks!&quot;
