This is a quick one volks. I worked late enough last night that I was too
tired to post.  I pulled the front windows out, wire brushed the rust from
around the frames.  Although there is pitting, nothing went through so I got
fortunate.  Using my sister's hair dryer, I masked off the area around the
windows (the heat helped it stick when it was in the upper 40's) and this
noon, I managed to POR15 around the window frame area.  My brother stayed in
the bus to quickly mop up any spills on the dash - thank god he was there or
I would have had the speckled bird dash. :-)  I'm late for work so more
later...

BTW:  I'm going to install the windows tonight.  I also had to use another
ww motor because my old 12v one was sparky and smoky.  I disassembled a junk
motor first to see if I could put it back together.  No problem!  I've got
new grease and a new sounding 12v splittle motor.  Had to treat the rust
around the WW posts and thus the windows had to come out so I could treat
them at the same time.  Later all...
