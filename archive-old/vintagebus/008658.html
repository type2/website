So while I was cleaning the front of my bus I found a circlip the looked
like it may have come from where my clutch cable attaches.  I'll be under
there tomorrow but my and i'll try and put the circlip back in or replace it
but my bently manual doesnt show where it goes - can anyone help me - where
does this circlip go?
