Ok.

I gave in and sent two steering boxes to Wolfgang for rebuilding.
Cost was $200 each.   It took about 5 weeks for them to rebuild
the boxes.  However, they arrived packed much better than a certain 
other vendor's steering boxes, and they even cosmolened the threads,
which Ithoguht was a nice touch.  They also ran a horn wire thru
the column.  The only down side was that I sent the box complete with 
the bracket and pinch bolts still attached, as well as the pitman arm
nut.  I had to pull these items off a spare box,as I needed to keep
them on the box that was in the panel, which is now going back into
the '55.

You also have to make your own box lub; they give  you instructions
on mixing STP with grease.  Luckily I had a good oil can, which I loaded
up with the mix and squirted it in.  Otherwise it would be nigh impossible
to fill it!  The idea of mixing the lubes is to combine the properties
of the two; the grease for leak-resitance, the STP for flow.  I also
added a couple squirts of 85/140 trans fluid just for good measure.

THe car drives much nicer now, although there is still a small amount
of play which I haven't tracked down yet.  The new box is pretty stiff,
but for comparison's sake, I could twirl the other box (out of the car)
lock-to-lock with my bare fingers; to &quot;steer&quot; the new box I needed to
grab the shaft firmly with a rag.
