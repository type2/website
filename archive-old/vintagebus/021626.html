Ok, heres a good one, you got those Barndoor mirror arms correct? Well I have
seen 'em on 2, 55's, on the passenger side. One is in the Brekina calendar,
the one with all the panels, and the other is a Single cab from the Lone Star
State. I guess those can not be called BD style any longer. Damn late models!

I have heard of the spring loaded mirror arms on early post barndoor 55s
being seen by people who swore they were original installations.   It would be
interesting to find out the VIN numbers.    I am interested in the early
postbarndoor splits- to see at what time certain parts changes were made.
Some things were only done for a short time- the seal for the gas tank door (?
BD trucks?) the one place stay for the rear hatch, the overhang intake air
grill, and some  parts also used on barndoors were used for a undefined (to
me) but limited period of time,   such as  spring loaded mirror arms (the few
mid 55 I saw did not have that, and one was about 20-124 xxx, double door
panel, have the number witten somewhere) &amp; bakelite interior lights, and some
had parts used on BDs, that have been associated w/bds because of the
unfamiliarity people understandably have with the earlier buses, but were used
for a nother year, circa 60,000 more production, such as  round tranny carrier
tubes, 3 piece doglegs, 6 legged middle seats, and front stamped bumpers with
the narrower liscence plate area.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to find out when changes were made, as you look
at  the old buses 1) there are fewer to be looked at, bothe because less were
made and less survived  2) the ones found are likely to have gone through much
modification over the years and much originality lost, and 3) Documented
evidence is often lacking.  

This can be frustrating if you find an old bus in some state of
disrepair/pieces missing, and you want to restore it to the original state.
Questions may be what size rims?  what kind of window latches?  sun visors?
upholstery?  Door handles?  Package tray?  Is this dash grab handle original,
a VW option, or  did someone get it from a hardware store?     When did they
change the stamping for the alumium part of the trim panels of the back and
middle seat?   Which deluxe buses have plastic caps for the bar on the back
seat, and which got metal?  What exact VIN was the change for all laminated
windows for 61-63?
What about the 59-&gt;61? rear truck bumper mystery?   Is it real?   Is it not?

Anyway, by the 58 ed of the Parts List, the spring loaded earlier style mirror
arm was not listed, just the kind that replaces the hinge pin.
