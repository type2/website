Looks like just a replacement.....maybe done because they would be easier to
remove?
A lot of times, if something is a PITA to remove then the person says the
heck with servicing it.....


&gt; I have a spare 36mm small nut tranny I was pullin parts off of including a
&gt; Redux box half, and I noticed it had 19mm bolt head fill plugs. Not a big
&gt; deal but not the typicall 17mm *allen* head bolts I'm used to. so the Q
is,
&gt; Is this from a different year (splitcase?),  or is it a 63 only 1 ton
redux
&gt; half ? I know its a 36mm tranny, but i just want to make sure this half
will
&gt; be ok to use. both sides top and bottom have this plug.

&gt; Dont even know if you can fit a 63 redux half on an earlier tranny, but i
&gt; wanted to make sure.
