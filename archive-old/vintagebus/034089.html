Vwhoward has a book with the formulas in it for mixing paint. Like 48 grams
of this 1/2 gram of this and 220 grams of this make the color. These
formulas have been used sucessfully by many a bus owner to get an almost
exact match. Vwhoward had some green mixed out of Omni (low budget PPG) and
when he sprayed the cab divider in his camper (virgin paint area) you could
not tell the blend area. When my redesigned web page and catalog are up i
will have these formulas on a seperate page for you to see.

ps. When i had Sikens mixed by the book code (sikens book code) it was way
off,  
have seen the same color useing VW's original formula, exact match.

&gt;&gt;The &quot;color code&quot; on your mtag is the internal code VW used to
&gt;&gt;represent that color.  You can't waltz into a paint store
&gt;&gt;and say &quot;Hey Joe, mix me up a gallon of L31, would ya?&quot; 

I see that Clara did it.  I, too, was able to ask for a match to L512
Velvet Green
and L87 Pearl White.  The DuPont book had a page with VW numbers on it.
 
Actually, I picked up a color chip page in a &quot;paper&quot; vendor booth at a
car show
with some of the codes on it.
