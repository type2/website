fischer,  you can say or makeup whatever you want,  your right you won,
you got my money and I got your crap case,   but just remember what comes
around goes around.  as for Kimball he knows and has apologized,   the
problem is his son Andy,   but keep bringing that up cause it helps take the
light off of you,     you, me,  some other list members and rimco know the
story so just give it up and spend my money  nobody cares,   so just email
the list with helpful stuff and not just your crap      john
