Subject: re:radio speaker

Someone just mentioned getting their speaker reconed or something like that.


Where does one go to get a speaker reconed? It would be nice to have the
original back in there. I remember some folks explaining how to recone
something yourself-with some paper and watered down glue?

I have the original speaker for my bus-but the paper cone is torn. I
replaced it with one I got at radio shack...I just walked in with the
original-and they had one in the back that was the exact same size-I never
checked the ohms or watts or anything...I just hooked it up and it worked.
It's am radio-so sound quality is not ever going to be amazing.

Unfortunately when I tried to replace my radio with one that didn't need an
auxiliary on/off switch it didn't work anymore. I think I just hooked
something up backwards-because my original radio doesn't work now either.

I use a portable cd player most of the time anyway-but it was nice to get
the AM thing going every now and then...someday when I have some free time
I'll tackle that problem...but it's pretty low in the list.
