Not sure if most know this or not, but, motors tend to stop at two
different spots everytime they shut down.  Those are the two same spots
that tend to get worn out on the flywheel as the starter is always
engaging those two same areas time after time.
Possibly...and this is just a wild guess mind you....the motor is hitting
that spot and it is in such a place in the rotation that there is always
one valve that is ever so slightly cocked open to allow the built up
compression past it...making that sound?????
I suppose to be sure, in case you haven't already, you should perform a
compression check?
My 3 cents worth
later
