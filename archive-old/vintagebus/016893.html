Subject: Tail light housing
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I sent this post and never saw it show up...so here it
goes again...

I recently purchased some repop euro tail lights and
housings.  The housings have a pretty chessy coating
on them.  I was wondering what I could put on them to
increase their life.  I expect with no treatment, they
will rust in about 6 months like every other repopped
part I've seen.  Should I paint the back (the part
inside the engine compartment) with rustoleum, por-15,
or something like that?  Or should I get the housings
zinc plated?  Just wondering, cuz they're pretty neat,
and I'd like to prevent them from corroding for as
long as possible.
