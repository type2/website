Subject: Cool Binz discovery
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Yesterday I went and looked at a Binz in a salvage yard.  The Binz tag was 
missing but I knew from replacing the headliner in mine that the guys at Binz 
had been known to write the number on the underside of the roof.  I pulled 
down the headliner and, viola', there it was!  8-)  There was also another 
word(s) there.  German of course.  Looks something like &quot;Fairbeufloin&quot; or 
something very similar.  I asked both Everett (TheSamba_dot_com) and WadesWagens 
(Dropgates_dot_com) to add the photo of it to their Binz pages.  The picture 
turned out very clear so it should be easy to read if you can read German.  
If anyone can translate it for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Dan

Found a Binz today.  Well, it was a known Binz but I saw it today for the 
first time.  Tag was missing but Binz wrote the number on the roof in grease 
pencil so I think I have that okay.  There was also another word(s) written 
there.  Could you guys put this photo on your Binz page so maybe someone can 
translate it for me?
