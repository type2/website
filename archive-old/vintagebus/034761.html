One of the styles of mirrors used was rectangular, the mirror attached 
differently than the round or elephant ear mittors.  The arm was curved, with 
a support bar that made it a D.  This style is less common.   The mirrors are 
fairly hard to find.  I had a 65 21 window that was a US bus that had two D 
arms on it.
