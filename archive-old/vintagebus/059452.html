Subject: Re: sundials

&gt;Talking to a friend about sundials tonight and rereading the interview of a
&gt;sundial employee it talks about sundials after 1970. My friend says she's
&gt;come across a hightop camper marked sundial.
&gt;So I'm wondering, has anybody ever seen a baywindow sundial or a hightop
&gt;sundial.
&gt;curious minds

heya chuck - young musician type down the street has a very desirable 68
hardtop sundial. very sleek indeed. also, mike sims on the list has a 70
over there about a mile away from here. minty and fresh it is i say. i dig
all the glass and chrome, and the layout is swell. not very excited about
the refigerator placement behind the driver's noggin, but the sink area
makes up for it. nice lines on the woodwork, chrome spice rack, and a round
little sink somehow make one feel like they're in a retro airplane.   -
