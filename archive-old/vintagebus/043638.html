&gt;
&gt;from VIN 832 733  (sept 61) took 221 847 081 D - the ones with white plastic 
&gt;knobs on,

Doliwa book agrees on chassis number and date (26 Sep 1961): &quot;rear window
closers flatter and with plastic knobs.&quot;

&gt;buses up to 20-76 673 got 221 847 081 for non deluxe (black knobs) and 
&gt;221 847 085 (white knobs) for deluxes.

No mention of knobs back this far in the book I have.

&gt;okay, not much help.  But seems to me long spoons were used something like
&gt;58 through early 61, on buses with 6 pop outs.

The note above for '61 is the last thing I can find at least back
through '57 in Doliwa.  The closest related thing I can find is
a note for 29 Aug 1958 where there was &quot;new upholstery for cab and
back seats&quot;...maybe the latches changed then.

&gt;Does anyone have an earlier M-code list than a 63 list?

A while back when we were talking about M 164 I sent what I had from
the Doliwa book...the book has 3 different lists: splitty, bay, Vanagon;
but within the lists some of the codes have dates on them when the
meanings changed.  I've never seen a &quot;full&quot; early list.

&gt;Maybe I should started studying the supercession lists.  excitement.

Maybe some day when it's raining too hard to work on the Bus...I hear
that it doesn't rain much up there though.  :)
