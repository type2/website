Subject: empi wheels

I picked up a set (4) of original empi 5 spoke wheels a bit ago.  These 
are the old 2 piece rims that are held together with 5 nuts/bolts. 
These are also the tubeless style, although I don't know if there was a 
tube style offered.  I suppose you could use tubes though.  These have 
steel valve stems.  Anyways, I was wondering what these nuts should be 
torqued to when they are sealed.  Should there be any washers used?

Thanks,
Isaiah
