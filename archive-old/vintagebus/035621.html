Its come time for me to get a new long block, and I was wondering if anyone in western oregon could recomend a good volkswagen engine builder. I have a few names, but would like a few more, as I have had bad experiences after laying down fat wads of cash in the past. I had originally planned to get a mexican long block but chickened out due to their lack of a warrenty. 
   Also, I will most likely get a new case have heard many contrary opinions about blocks from mexico and brazil. have heard their is a poor quality brazil case, a mexico case that is b
etter and a brazil case thats superior to both, with better oil passages than the other brazil case and
 a relief on the front of the block that helps prevent blown main seals that the case from mexico lacks. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?
