Hi Steve,
Looks like the front bench seat with the back piece having the driverside 
back curve built into it might have started at.
27 OCT 60  Chassi No. 673 946     Bench seat in cab.  Now: Shape of cushion 
and back rest modified, both adjustable in three positions.
30 JULY 62  Chassi. No. 971 550     Driver's seat.  Now: Seperate seats.  
Formerly: Bench seat.
So this bench seat for the front might have been used for two years (1961-62) 
instead of only in 1962 like we had previously thought!   Eric&amp;Barb
