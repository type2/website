Brake stuck ON!
&gt;
&gt;I heard once that it could be the flexible lines by the wheel ends swelling
&gt;and not releiving pressure.   Is this possible?
&gt;

Yep happened to me twice. Simple, cheap, easy to fix. Look at those rubber 
hoses, replace all four. I found a big bubble in two. Couldnt blow air 
through them once I had taken them off. You will probably see what I mean!!!
