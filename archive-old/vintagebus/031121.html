&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I went out and charged the battery today and evaluated what minimum I
&gt; needed to do just to get down to OCTO. The heart is willing but the
&gt; hardware is just too far gone. I will be driving the #%anger truck.
&gt; Anyone want to give me a ride in a real german vehicle? Scott?
&gt;

Chris,
I'd be glad to have someone riding shotgun.  Drop by early and we can head off.
I'm bringing a push up tarp for some shade out there in the barren parking lot.
Any goodies you might have for swap we can transfer into the truck bed.  I'll be
bringing down the link pin beam - wheel to wheel.  Hopefully, I won't have to
bring it back.

Scott
