I personally want to know whats just come in or is for sale.....

If Ronnie  and the rest of the bus &quot;shops&quot; ( real or internet only ) have 
something new come in , or back into stock , then tell us....

I do not want to see a full data dump of their catalogs, but so far no one 
has done that........

Also all the guys across the country that have parts that might help someones 
else restoration, let us know , Most of the buses my friends buy always need 
something to put them back in shape.......

Also why not start your subject with For Sale or FS , then the people that do 
not want to look can just delete it..........

Lets keep this fun......after all we are not Porsche people.......
