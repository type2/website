Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for tips for Metal replacments and sandblasting

Steve,

thanks for the input.  I do have a welder and do know
how to use it.  It is a MIG but i also have access to
a TIG at work.

What i mean by weeping is that the solution used to
elliminate the rust inside the gates would leak out of
the seams slowly.  Even after a year, i still had some
fluid comming out of the hing area of all 3 gates.  I
am hoping to find another way to get the rust out of
there.

Thanks for your help.

&gt; &gt; not happy because the gates &quot;weeped&quot; for over a
&gt; year later
&gt; 
&gt; What does &quot;weeped&quot; mean?

&gt; &gt; -  Ripples in the bed.
&gt; 
&gt; Get a big ball peen hammer and flail away at it.
&gt; You'll need a stud or dent
&gt; puller to get to the places that run over the bed
&gt; supports.
