Hey everyone,

I found the M-code plate on my bus, since the bus used to be a flipseat 
camper, it was located right above where the passenger would put his/her 
rear end.  I figured most of it out using the NEATO site, but I had a couple 
of questions about the paint codes.  Here is the entire tag:

30 9
361 B35
SZ 2311 523622 1176847

I figured out that the bus was originally sent to switzerland (SZ) and the 
B35 code means the Westy SO-35 interior.  Anyone know what 361 is, and can 
tell me about the color code?

Thanks!
