And if money's no object, then one could get some LN Engineering
&quot;Nickies&quot; http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/nickies.html . One could probably
pull quite a sizeable trailer without risk of overheating with that set
up. But I digress, I was trying to illustrate that there is a cost
competitive alternate to the type II and type IV rebuild that could
offer benefits over the standard practice.

And if you are really adventurous there is a great 3.1 liter conversion
using the Corvair engine with Type IV 2.0 pistons and jugs.
