Chris,

These most likely are the wires for the AC outlet inside your camper.  They
run along the left side of the bus to the exterior AC inlet plug.  64-65 it
is installed in the left rear corner, and 66-67 in the left side of the
bus.  There are some inconsistencies though.  I have a 67 that has the plug
inlet at the left corner like my 65.  All the other 67's I've seen have been
located just aft of the drivers side door 1/4  the way up the side.

If the inlet plug is still there, there should also be a rubber boot that
would have covered the wires that attached to the plug from the inside.

Should only be 3 wires.  The 4th might have been for a gas heater...not sure
though.

Steve
