Subject: distributer question

Wonder if someone might have an answer on this.
at a garage sale my wife picked up a mechanical advance distibuter. She
recognized it as
a Volk's part, bless her, but thats about it.
It's manufactured by BOSCH. The part number is 0231129019
under the part number is an arrow pointing left and next to it are the letters
JFR4
The unit is very clean. I'm wondering if it will work on my bus. Does anyone
know if condenser and points
are still available? Oh Yeah, the condenser on it's bottom has GERMANY, a
BOSCH trademark and the numbers
1 237 330 055  Underneath that is another series of numbers  #721
Lets see, the distributer cap has a part number  ZVS75Z6 embossed on it
underneath that are the numbers 187.
Although this particular distributer is clean. To me it appears old. I'm
really curious
since earlier I was re-reading one of my favorite books. The 71 edition of the
Idiot book. John Muir seemed to really like his
mechanical advance distributer. On page 87 he refers to the one he uses (or
used). Could this be the same model?
I wonder.
