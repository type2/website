Subject: RE: [VB] What are these red things?

In my recent aborted attempt to swap out my 3 speed 
tranny (pops out of 4th) the only part I changed were 
the red pads with stock German pads. There is a notable 
difference in vibration and in shifting. I say leave it 
stock unless you have a big engine and torque twisting 
is a real problem. My 1855cc with small Dells is happier 
with the stock.

p.s. Don, which aisle at the supermarket has Soylent 
Green? 

&gt; 
&gt; Don,
&gt; those are aftermarket urethane tranny mounts. Check out the latest VW JC
&gt; Whitney catalog or any of the VW suppliers in the mags. They are perfectly
&gt; fine unless you want to return your bus to rock stock.
