&lt;&lt;  the
 play should be .4 to .6 off the top of my head- think that's inches- like for
 setting the valves.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
The measurement you are giving is 4 to 6 tenths of an inch, as in just around
half an inch.  The measurements for the end play in inches should be .003&quot; to
.005&quot;, as in thousands of an inch.    Eric &amp; Barb
PS Using the top of ones head for critical measurements is not recommended.
Which is why we carry a couple of repair books at all times.   EEE&amp;B

ah, well, so it is- I have trouble with those decimals sometimes, I meant to
put those zeros in there.   If I was doing a repair where I was uncertain of
the measurement, I would have looked it up to make sure, nice of you to check
that for him,

Clara
