Joel and listees,
All I have found so far is 115, 120s, 55 pilot...Do you think I could go
with a 55 pilot, 50 aux, and 120 main? My plugs are brown at the
electrode area, slight black at the thread edges, I am close to begin
with, and these plugs got fux0red when I first ran the engine with the
old carb from hell. This week end wil see new plugs to diagnose better,
but I am thinking just the pilot reduced might be fine for me....
Is a 120main 55 pilot (instead of 65) and  50 aux a possible
combination?&gt;
Still learning,
AL

Bus is up and running again, as good if not better than she was. I think
some of the rich running problem may have been fuel pump related, max
stroke was 14mm, I shimmed it back down to 13mm with a big stack of
gaskets. Should have done that first. 115 mains was a bust, ran but
spitted like it was way lean, all the way from idle to wide open. I
replaced mains with a 117.5, surprisingly easy with carb in place, and
all seems well. I've only put a dozen miles on it since, I'll drive into
Sacramento tomorrow (another 40+ miles round trip) and pull the sparkers
for a look after that. Does anyone know if the 1mm washer/shim is the
right one to use under the float needle valve for this carb? I also
patched up the cracking windshield seals with some roofing cement, no
more water running down the dash and soaking my left knee when it rains.
That is real progress! Glad you all are back, try to stay warm. Joel '64
Sundial (unstoppable) '67 Kombi (unstartable) Ps. Almost totally bus
unrelated, except I will use the bus to get to the trailhead, but are
any of you hikers who may have experience using one of the gore-tex bivy
sacks? I am looking at the Outdoor Research Bivy, but balking at the
$250 sticker. Worth it, or just suck it up under a tarp and count the
money I've saved? Royal Arch route Grand Canyon, ten days, early
January, is the issue. Not enough flat space for a tent, fair chance of
rain and flash floods, down bag useless when wet...
