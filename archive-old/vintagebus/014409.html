	Welcome back Erin. You were really missed. Can't wait to hear how the
rebuild goes, I think you'll find that once you start putting it to
gether your love of VWs will come back even more than before. One thing
about having another bus around is that when you forget where something
goes you can take a look at the other one and see. But then you have to
have some place to put it. I sure like where I'm living, I don't have to
worry about cars in my back yard, my neighbor ( aka. landlord ) has more
VWs than I do. Glad to have ya back.
