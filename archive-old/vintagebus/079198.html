Subject: RE: [VB] What shocks do you prefer

&gt; With regard to the thread on favorite brand &quot;shocks&quot;.
&gt; On my 1963 deluxe I'm using Bilstien's. I've had them
&gt; for several years and really like them. For me just the
&gt; right amount of firmness and roadability when cornering.


As with many products, you reach a point of diminishing returns, where after
a certain price point it takes a lot more money to get a little better
performance. I'd have to put the Bilsteins on the other side of that curve,
at more than twice the price of the AlKo's even with my discount prices.
That said, they are probably the best shock you can put on your bus. They
handle well, without the objectionably stiff ride associated with many gas
shocks. If they were $35 each like the AlKo's are, I'd buy them (although
the AlKo's acquit themselves suprisingly well). Even if they were $50 each
I'd probably still buy them. But for about $75 each ... well, I guess it
would depend on how my checkbook balance looked...
