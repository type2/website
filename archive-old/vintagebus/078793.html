Subject: Re:  Bill Colville...

We are very sorry to hear of the loss of Bill to his family, friends and the
Type 2 community.  While I don't believe that we ever met him personally,
through JP's stories and the more recent reports, we still feel his loss and
send our thoughts and best wishes to all who knew Bill personally.

Keep his memory alive!

&gt; I got a call this morning that Bill Colville finally
&gt; let go and died during the night.  We are missing a
&gt; great presence; Bill was a wonderful man, a gentle
&gt; giant, and Janet deserves our commiserations.  I know
&gt; of none other in this community who did more to make a
&gt; campout more enjoyable or who was willing to share his
&gt; humor and wisdom than Bill.
&gt;
&gt; Send any cards or letters to:
&gt;
&gt; Janet Colville
&gt; 1350 Pigeon Rd.
&gt; Las Cruces, NM
&gt; 88007
&gt;
&gt; Thank you, Bill for your friendship..
&gt;
