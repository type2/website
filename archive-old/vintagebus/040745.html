My fiancee and I recently purchased a '66 split window.  Since then we have been trying to sort through the many models of the bus.  My question is actually pretty easy.  We havn't been able to figure out what the differences between a combie and a microbus is.  We've seen pictures of both, and they look fairly similar.
