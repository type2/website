Ok, this 1966 bus thing is new to me. I drag the bus down off the car dolly
and it sits askew off my driveway. The back brakes are frozen somehow, so I
crawl under yesterday to back off the star adjustment thingy. #)*&amp;^_at_#%_at_ There
is no adjustment hole. Is it behind the reduction boxes? How does one get out
of this catch 22? 
 -- - - - 
take off the hubcap- the hole is easily accessable - you don have to crwl 
under.   But if your brakes are frozen, maybe you should take the drums off 
and check out inside.   Has it been sitting a while?   10 years huh?   New 
brake hoses are in order.    Inspect your front brakes too- may need wheel 
cyinders all the way round.   Brakes are cheaper and less hassle than 
accidents and hospitals.

I also checked the compression on the old engine. 0/20/0/30. Bummer. Well, I
will have to convert to 12V sooner or later anyway. What use is the old motor?
After I get the newer 1600cc (just incase of core charge or something), I will
write and give/trade it to the list.

usually the motor is good for a core.   You take all the stuff off and strip 
it down to a long block (as per Muir idiot manual)  to give to the 
rebuilders.   Then you put your stuff back on.  A bad motor does not mean you 
have to convert to 12V, you have all the working 6V stuff right?   6V is fine 
and dandy.

BTW, while the motor is out, drain your trans and RGBoxes, put new axle boots 
on, and refill wth GL-L tranny oil.   Install cleaned center plugs, then fill 
boxes, last fill  center section.   Warming the trans oil in a bucket of hot 
water before filling is nice for pumping it in easier.   Might as well put in 
a new engine to body seal, and clean all your light grounds and hots too.
