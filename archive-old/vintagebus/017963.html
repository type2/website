Ronnie and John were talking:
 &gt;I was told it was a late 53 when I bought it, which
would 
have been
&gt; a dream being todays my birthday and I've always
wanted a 
year of birth
bus,

Hey Ronnie,
Happy birthday young man, and thank you for your help 
throughout the year.
I was born in November 1950; I'd like to have a year
of 
birth bus too!!!!

I'd like a year-of-birth bus too, but I was born in
1948  :-(   &lt;G&gt; 

 Happy birthday, Ronnie!
