This is my first winter with my bus. I live in IN. Twice now I have blown 
the gasket out of my oil filter in the bitter cold because the oil froze in 
the filter and blocked flow. I have a full flow system. I know the only way 
to get the water out is to change the oil or get the oil temp up past 220F 
but when it's cold here reaching it takes me about 45min. to get the temp up 
that high.  Are there any additives for the oil to help this?  Is there some 
other remedy I am overlooking?

Scott
