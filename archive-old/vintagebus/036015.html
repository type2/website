Description:
Looking for a magazine article. Its a one page review on &quot;Driving the new 
imports VOLKSWAGEN KAMPER&quot;. Has four photos of a U.S. export model 55-56 
westfalia flip hatch and a small write up about it. I'd like to get ahold of 
a original magazine with this article, or atleast a high quality lazer copy 
of it. Not sure which magazine its in.....will pay top dollar. Or if anyone 
knows the magazine.....let me know! Thanks-Greg
