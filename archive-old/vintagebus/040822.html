I cobbled together a simple press out of angle iron,
threaded rods, misc nuts and bolts.  When the time 
came to remove the steering wheel in the '67 I reconfigured
the contraption into a puller.  I had to find properly
threaded bolts to fit into the threaded holes, and with
a center bolt pushing against the center threaded 
portion, it came right off.  I used regular bolts 90 degrees
to the puller bolts to hold the angle iron against the 
puller bolts.

Worked really well.  FWIW I cobbled the press to assemble
hydraulic lifters for my '80 Vanagon.
