Subject: Where to find curtain attachments material

I have a 65 camper.
I have 2 requests for information:
First, the drivers portion has a &quot;double track&quot; system to hang
curtains.  Where could I buy the curtains and the attachments which
would fit into the double track system.

Second, I just bought a used VW tent, which I believe attaches to the
gutter and the bumpers.  I only got the tent without any poles or
instructions.

Any suggestions on where to find instructions on how it attaches?

thanks
dave
