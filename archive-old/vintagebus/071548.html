Subject: Splittie Doors ?'s

Good Sunday
    Am looking for some splittie front doors for my 61 Deluxe and was
wondering if there is a difference between early doors (earlier than 62) and
the late splittie doors (after 63)?
Let me know what you know!  Also looking for a 61 deck lid (what years work
here) and some cargo doors that don't have the bottoms rusted out.  I have
door repair panels from Metwiz but looking to avoid that mess if I can?
Thanks
Rob
