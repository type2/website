&gt;When was the last time _you_ contributed anything to the list
community? 

I looked through the archives and all I found was a couple of requests
for information and a lot of whining about various topics.  Nothing
else of substance.  I suggest that these folk might be better off over
on alt.flame where they can get their kicks without causing any harm.

Hi George-  
	NO one is _required_ to post anything of substance or value, in
order to be a subscriber. But as for what I add, outside of hard to find
parts for sale, or occasional information, is a point of view.  A few of
us are not content to merely walk the middle ground with the silent
majority.  Perhaps you feel better when averything is safe and comfy, but
more descriptive term than 'safe' may be complacent.  That is disturbing
to me.  I think it is good thing to kick up the dirt now and then,
history has proven that it is necessary for change.  But I'm not out to
make history, just want to add my two cents like everyone else.  Would a
nice juicy trip report from me satisfy you, and make me worthy of your
precious newsgroup?...

I haven't done anyone any harm, and I have no apology.  Stop whining and
fix your bus yourself.
