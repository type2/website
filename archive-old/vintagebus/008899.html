Subject: Idle/throttle stops for 40IDF's needed.

I'll soon be at point with my 67 bus where I need to get the rebuilt 1776
into it.  Before installation though, I want to be able to have the engine
all test run and the bugs worked out of it.  I still haven't located a set
of idle/throttle stops for my 40idf's.  I've been told that there is a piece
that goes on the carb FIRST and then the Berg linkage goes on next.  The
first piece contains a flat arm that rests on the throttle stop screw on the
carb body itself.  I called Fast Freddies and they told me that their piece
works with their linkage but can't confirm it for anyone else's.

Can anyone help me out here?  I'm afraid that because of this little problem
of which I have no answer, I'll have to yank the carbs and run a 34-pict or
some grossly mismatched carb.  I've got the money for it, I just need the
part...
