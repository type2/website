Subject: Even more reduction gear box questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
This has been a good week on the list for getting many
of my questions anwered. I've been doing some work on
my 65 double cab--it had a restricted front brake hose
(I had figured that out a week or two ago--darn hoses
go bad after only 35 years!), and I decided to replace
the rear shoes also--front shoes and wheel cylinders
are only a couple of years old and look good inside
and out, as do the metal brake lines. 
But I had a slow leak from the driver's side reduction
gear box, so decided to replace the seals and gasket
as it was hard to tell what was leaking.  There is a
slight amount of play in the short shaft (the one the
wheel mounts to).  How much play is allowable? The
books all seem to say any play is too much, so I plan
to replace the bearings--actually bought the outside
roller bearing (the expensive one) 4 or 5 years ago so
I will just need the other 3 for each side.
Here's my &quot;real&quot; question.  I'm wondering about the
plug (211 501 249) at the back side of the reduction
gear housing that must be removed for access to the
nut on the inside end of the short shaft.  I have
looked up  the part in a number of different catalogs,
and the price of the plug varies from $14.50 down to
$1.25!  There has to be some difference to make such a
difference in price.  Can anyone speak from experience
on this?  Do I need to replace the plug,  who sells
the best one, is the cheapest one good enough, etc.?
Any other tips or hints on these reduction gear boxes
not already mentioned in the past week or in the
archives (yes, I have looked there and read pages of
good stuff) will be appreciated.

And, if anyone has been wondering, I did get the front
shift rod seperated from the rear one--had to slit the
end of the front rod and chisel it off, but I also
managed to tap it back to shape and it should be
reusable.  Must be the only rusty connection on my
double cab--even the brakes and related pieces came
apart easily.

Thanks everyone for your help.

Jim  (in western Wisconsin)
