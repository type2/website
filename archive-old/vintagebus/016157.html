Hello...last time I sent this, I said not to reply to this address...if anyone had any helpful tidbits, please reply to the list...

Do not reply to this address...it doesn't work!

Hi!  I am now actuall in the process of removing the rotted metal from the floor of my '67.  All I can think of as I work is the phrase posted by someone a day or few ago...&quot;our buses rot from the inside out&quot;  How true!  Having never seen behind and into rockers or door posts, I am aghast!  So I remove more metal than I planned...I'll post pics somewhere as things develop (pun intended)...this is something to share!  

Here's my question:  If I want to use POR-15 or similar chemical treatment to preserve the remaining bus (ya, I know...many of you have seen much worse!)...and I intend to weld...how do I do it?  I was thinking that I should leave or drill a hole or three to spray said chemicals under high pressure into the affected area after all welding takes place, then sealing it up.  This goes for the places unseen that I can't get to...I have a feeling that I would find the evil rust devils lurking in every crevice...and this bus is one of the best ones I've seen!  

Whadd'ya think of my idea?

Gene
