Well my 2 new single cabs are almost here, My 57 single was just loaded at
Rex Rogers in San Angelo, Texas and both should be here by Friday night, the
bummer is that Rex got to see and drive! my side loader berfore I even got
to see it or drive it, it even sounds better from what Rex said then I
expected from just seeing photo's, even has original Goodyear 15 inch truck
tires on it, wow!

going on another bus hunt Saturday, got a lead on a 50/60's club cab and
another bus from the early 50's, there is also 27 plus other VW's there, so
if it works out and some of you crossovers are interested, I will post a
list when I return of the other VW's there, from what I was told there are
3, 58 Ghias, at least 10 verts, a couple ovals, a couple of station wagons,
etc. The property owner wants to sell these to collect back rent owed on the
property, so prices should be fair and hopefully they are not just junk.
