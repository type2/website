  Sounds like the same thing that happened to me on the way to the Classic
this year. I started to loose number 2 exhaust valve. I had to stop every 50
to 100 miles to readjust it, finally took the roller tip adjuster off and
put in a regular screw and got more miles out of it, made it 500 miles that
weekend till there was no more valve adjustment left. Am pulling the engine
tomorrow to pull the head to get it fixed so I can drive to Familian Fest
this weekend.

ps. Love those Manley valves, all the abuse and they still don't break, just
hope we can weld up the valve seat base. I am sure I hammered it way into
the head!!

changing
&gt; every removable part the bus would still run the same. Finally changed out
&gt; the dizzy with the petronix in it and bus ran like a champ after that.
After
&gt; all the work it turned out the electronic ignition had started to take a
&gt; dump. So try a new dizzy with points and see if it makes a difference.

Ronnie,

My #3 exhaust has lost 4mils from .008. I'm afraid it's a valve seat
getting ready to go to lunch. The E-ignition is working fine.

I'm wondering if the new carb I installed recently is jetted wrong for the
engine. It's a stock 34PICT brasil. The one that's been in there was a
German Solex that I kept running for 10 years, with 127.5 main jet. It's
leaking around the butterfly bushings badly now, so I replaced it. The
engine was doing regular temps and pressure all the way down.

I'm wondering if I can disable the cylinder without damaging the engine
for six hundred miles.
