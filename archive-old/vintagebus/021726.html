Subject: [VB] Wood Strips_blind pop rivets
To: ignatius.geo_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 I know what a regular
pop-rivet is, but a &quot;blind&quot; one?
Robert is the guy, (Robert Davis) in Santa Barbara who was selling wood 
strips for single &amp; doublecabs a while ago on the list.
A blind pop-rivet is a special rivet that has a closed end, i.e., it will not 
leak water through the center as a regular pop-rivet does.
You can get them in stainless and I used to use them on my Hobiecat where you 
do not want water to get past the rivet.
