 I just picked up a 1958 single cab.
I need a rear tailgate for it.
What years are correct? Is it just a 53-67 thing? Or is there a difference 
anywhere in between?
Also what can I expect to pay for a NICE one? If there is such a thing?
Anyone got a decent one for sale????
Id take a dove blue one in almost ANY condition.
Anyone have an idea of what i can expect to pay for one?????
I also need a set of correct taillights.
Buying whatever as I kinda would like to drive this thing.
Look for it at BBBIV.
Dove blue 58 single that looks pretty damn hideous with yellow california 
plates.
Thanks for the help and/or leads.
Regards, Greg
