I would LOVE to get that bus to park in my front yard, just to drive a 
certain A-Hole neighbor nuts.  I was turned in AGAIN to the city for 
working on my daughters '71 SB and prepping it for paint.  Unfortunately, I 
blew out my back again and its taking a bit longer than we hoped.

I could see a very nice paint job on the side of it, looking some what like 
a business script saying
&quot;Leave the the F- Alone!&quot;
I'd spell out F, but this is a family neighborhood.

Hey, I'll be in Dallas the first week of Dec, but I'm sure you're hoping to 
have it sold by then.
