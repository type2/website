Bob,

I've removed mine a couple of times now, and the drum to drum method is by far
easier than attempting to remove axles and the like.  There's really not to much
to it.  Since you are parting it anyways, it might be easier to just cut the e
brake cables to save the little clips and reusing a cable can be a little iffy.
If you don't want to cut the cables, release the e-brake up front, pull the
brake drums, grab the horizontal lever looking thing the cable is attached too
and pull/ push toward the center (ie release the tension on the cable) and slip
the loop on the cable end off.  With the loop end free, grab the spring that is
on the cable and pull it toward the loop end.  This should reveal a flat clip
that is holding the cable in the brake backing plate.  Remove the clip.  With
the clip free, the cable can be slide out of the backing plate.  Remove the 4
spring plate bolts that connect the reduction box to the spring plate, on each
side.  KEEP these bolts in a safe place as finding replacements is becoming more
difficult.  Remove the two nuts from the front tranny mount, pull the grounding
strap out off of the stud.  Remove the nuts (2 on each side) at the rear tranny
mounts.  Put your jack under the drain plug of the tranny, and jack it up to
raise the tranny up.  I had to use 2 X 4s under my jack to get it high enough.
I just made a little track for the jack to roll on.  The reduction boxes will
start to slip off of the spring plates.  I found it best to help them a long as
you are pulling the tranny back.  Give each axle a tug toward the rear as you
are pulling the tranny back on the jack.  After the tranny is moved back as far
as it will go, lower the tranny (which will still be held by the bus), and put
the jack under the closest point outside the rear tranny mount.  If you have a
22 or 24 mm socket (don't remember which) and a huge breaker bar, you can remove
the two large bolts that hold the rear tranny mount and just slide the whole
thing out in one shot.  This is a lot easier.  Don't pull or put hold the weight
of the tranny on the input shaft into the engine as it may bend, grab the top of
the bell housing for leverage.  Well that's all I can think of.

Good luck,
Aaron
