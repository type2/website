Subject: Re: [VB] 1966 bus preheat system?

Hmmm, very interesting...

My '67 DC has the preheat system I described, versus getting preheat
from the heater boxes.  I had assumed it to be correct and original. If
your info is correct, I would have to guess that when the first owner
back in Calif. replaced the engine over 20 years ago (as best as I can
determine) he also switched the heater boxes to ones without preheat
outlets.  He certainly did plenty of other screwy things which I
belatedly discover from time to time.

&gt; Hi Chris, that is a great description of the pre heat set up up to part way
&gt; through 66.   But the system changed to get pre heat from the heater boxes
&gt; early in 66, and for 67.  so the most 66/67 preheat does not usethe metal
&gt; pick up tube.  Of course, you can put either style on your bus.
