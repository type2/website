I have a 58 SC that I have been contemplating parting out.  Can anyone tell

me what the side gates are worth?  How 'bout the front and rear bumpers?

How 'bout the shell with a perfect nose and dash and good tunnel tranny with

redux boxes?  How 'bout the steering wheel?

well, why the heck are you thinking of parting it out?  Does it haev rust?
They all do, but how bad?   C'mon now,  WE MUST SAVE THEM!!!!!

and since I got my 59 SC it seems to me that a lot of people want the trucks.
