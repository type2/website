&gt; Are the Mosquito nets found on Baywindows the same ones for the large hatch

Hi Dave,
Yes they are!  We had to have one for our 1960 walkthru panel camper 
conversion so we had Dawn of PLF make us one that would fit the smaller 
earlier hatch.  Only changed to velcro instead of the screwed into the body 
snaps.  Does wonders to keep the insects out and let out the heat when 
camping in warm weather!
