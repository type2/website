&gt; I got this nice VDO tach off of e&amp;%y

Hmm...hopefully somebody didn't let the smoke out of it before they sold
it to you...

&gt; Got everything hooked up and cranked the bus up, tach not working. Tach
&gt; was hooked to coil negative terminal.

How many wires does it have?  Since it apparently has a light it should
have at least three: signal, ground, and lamp.  Some tachs also have a
+12 V wire.  Some of them use one ground for both the meter and the
lamp, while others have two wires coming off of the lamp.

You should be able to make it work back in the engine compartment.  Hook
the signal wire to the tach negative terminal (the same place as the
wire from the points) and the ground wire to ground.  If it has a +12 V
wire, hook that up THROUGH A FUSE (DO NOT OMIT THIS FUSE) to battery
positive.  Use a VW-style 8 A fuse or an American-style 5 A fuse.  If
the tach doesn't work with short, simple connections to the points and
the battery, it probably doesn't work period.  With this setup, the
light won't work.
