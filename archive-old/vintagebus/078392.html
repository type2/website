Folks,

THis is the exact reason why I put out this link on the list last week.

http://www.fireadesource_dot_com/

http://www.fireadesource_dot_com/fireade-auto-racing-track.html

THis one is particularly good as it was also watched by speedvision

http://www.ph7technology_dot_com/ph7technologySpeedVisionInterview.htm

Notice what they say about the temperature of the metal parts
after extinguishing the fire.

I just bought two and plan to make a mock up of an engine compartment
out of cardboard and try one  out.

Cheers, dave

&gt; the vehicle was saved)
