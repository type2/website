just got back from a dump run. rachel's '56 single cab, Zeb, and i took a
load of dirt and yard waste. his usual nimbleness and gazelle-like driving
qualitites were greatly diminshed due to the heavy load. it was more like
slug-ness and mushy apricot steering. a few tires-hitting-the-doglegs bumps
and we were there. the scale said 3760 pounds, which i don't know how much
more than empty weight that is, but after the dirt was all unloaded, Zeb
was back to his olympic athlete status. we went to a local vw shop to pick
up a clutch cable bowden tube for my '61, and then it was back to monterey.
on the way back, we detoured and passed a body shop with a BARNDOOR PANEL
sitting outside in its lot, awating restoration i can only presume. there
also appeared to be a 21 or 23 window (all shiny) parked next to it, but i
couldn't see it that well.  
so, it's off to the great outdoors to replace my clutch cable, which was
kind enough not to break and still operate with only 2 strands of cable
left.
