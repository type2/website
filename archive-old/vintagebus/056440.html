Subject: Run the thermostat or not?

The engine I'm running was built a couple years ago.  It was built on a =
brand new case.  The case does not have the provision for the thermostat =
bracket so at the time I didn't install one.  Figure since my case =
didn't have one they must not be running thermostats down in Brazil, =
Mexico, or where ever they are/were selling new &quot;old style&quot; Beetles at =
the time.  All the places they were still selling the Type 1 Beetle =
generally have a hot climate...I live in Florida so my thinking at the =
time was that I would be okay if I just let it warm up a little before =
heading out.  Engine runs fine but I'm going to be pulling it this week =
for some other work and was having some second thoughts on the =
thermostat and was thinking about putting one in.  Any opinions?  (Ha, =
like bus folks don't have opinions on engines!)

Thanks,
Dan
