What is a Port?   evidently I may be mistaken thinking is is a place by the 
sea where ships unlade cargos ofVWs for our driving pleasure.    No, it is 
not like that.   It may well be a Customs Port of Entry.  Which is something 
completely different.  SO why not Alberta?

Actually, it has to do with US Customs.

Go to www.askjeeves_dot_com

Type 'what is a port of entry' and then click on ask.

Scroll down and click on United States Customs ports of entry.

The 1st page defines it.

Click on the map for Calif. and the list will come up. Fresno is on it.

Click on Fresno. The &quot;port&quot; is downtown!!!!  In room 1208B!!!!  I think the

only &quot;port&quot; in the room is wine:))
