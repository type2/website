Subject: Re: [VB] Ben Pons autograph?

And didn't VW Trends do an article on how &quot;sano&quot; those napkins were?

Dan Kinsey wrote:
&gt; The napkin was the exact size and color as the original, and both the sketch
&gt; and the signature looked authentic...it was the Empi logo that gave it away
&gt; as a repro.  VOA lawyers have contacted Empi about the unauthorized
&gt; reproduction and the use of the name &quot;Ben&quot; which VOA has trademarked.
