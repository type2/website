Subject: Re: [T2] steering box recommendation

Hi Wallace,

No problem from me, your's is good advice.  I found in the past, Ford sells a
&quot;light&quot; grease designated for use in their manual steering gears to avoid a
leakage problem when using 90 wt.  I have used Red Line CV-2 synthetic grease in
manual steering boxes in several vehicles and have experienced no problems.  You
are right to recommend against a heavy grease, as along with other problems, you
probably couldn't turn the wheel in really cold weather.  My thicker oil and
light grease information was only if David could not adjust his steering box, or
find a replacement.

Keep smiling and thanks for making me think,

Mike


&gt; now I don't wish to start a flame war but I think the above is realy poor
&gt; advice. Using a thicker oil/grease to compensate for wear is not a good
&gt; idea....

My response is not intended as a flame, only my perspective on the subject.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine used to have a split screen van, the king pins were worn so
&gt; just before the annual inspection he packed them with the heaviest grease he
&gt; could find.

&gt;

&gt; Good luck
&gt; Bob Wallace
