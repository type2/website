Subject: Re: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ ??

Ditto everything Kyle said!

If you have problems getting the axle nut off try RV tire shops.  Their
tools are just insane heavy duty!

Usually free too, they always get a chuckle out of old VW stuff :)

I went into an RV tire place for a frozen lug nut one time.  The old tire
guy said &quot;one of two things are going to happen here...  The lug will come
out or it will shear in half.  You still want me to hit it with the impact
wrench?&quot;  of course I nodded &quot;Yup&quot;...  One flick of the impact wrench and it
was off, dude just chuckled and said that wasn't even a challenge.... I felt
like a big wussy, I had leaned on that lug with a 6' cheater bar and got
nothing :(
