Thanks for all the help. I looked at it this morning, and it was the high idle cam which had flipped over. I corrected its location, and she ran beautifully.

It is still pouring rai here, so when it drys up I'll start looking at it more closely to determine where this special stop pin that y'all said I should find on this part.

thanks again,
