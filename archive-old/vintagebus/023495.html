&lt;&lt; so, is that what the radio in a 67 bus would have looked like? I've heard 
that VW didn't import them with radios, so maybe not? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
It is one of many radios which could have been installed either at the 
factory or the Euro/USA dealerships.  A VW could be imported into USA with a 
radio in it only if the VW was used!  Some VW dealerships installed radios 
before customers bought them.  There was a program for N. American VW buyers 
would fly or float across to Europe pick up thier new VW from the factory or 
one of the Euro VW dealerships.  The new VW owner would then tour Europe and 
then return thier now used VW to one of the VW factory shipping ports.  
Saving alot on the import taxes and getting a VW to tour Europe all at once!
