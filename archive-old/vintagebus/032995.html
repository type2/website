 the owner (a non-vw person) who's willing to sell parts of it, suggested
 that i cut the whole bed off and weld the back end to my truck.  what are
 the pros and cons of this?  my immediate thought was to cut the bed out
 below the cross-member supports and then free the bed panel from the
 cross-members and perimeter.  now i'm kind of inclined to buy the whole
 truck and take the bed panel off at the spot welds and curled lip of the
 perimeter.  that way i could weld diamond plate on the '60 and it could
 continue life as a flatbed and my truck would be as i want it.  it seems to
 me that i have a lot of ideas but hardly any sense or guidance.  thoughts
 please.

drilling at the spot welds would be easiest.  think you got it.  If you start 
cutting into the fram you create more work for yourself.  You can gett spot 
weld drill bits, they cut circles rather than holes- really cool.
