Subject: RE: [VB] Death of the list

I personally am fighting a slight case of VW Bus burnout. OCTO and 
the Classic was the straw for me. All those VW's together like that 
kinda made 'em seem not so special. Should have had the opposite 
affect. Did'nt though.

And then having the rebuilt head on the engine I overhauled for my 
'59 Kombi go before even having 3000 miles REALLY sucked. so now it's 
more money and another engine pull. Doesn't make for very much fun VW 
driving. Also doesn't help make me feel good about making any kind of 
long trip in my bus.

So I've been working on my wife's '70 vert bug while my bus sits 'til 
I'm ready to deal with it. I gotta spend time on my other projects so 
I'll have a back-up VW. But my spoiled '59 Kombi has monopolized my 
time for the last 2 years. No more.
