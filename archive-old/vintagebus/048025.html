&lt;&lt; What I've *never* heard is to retorque only the bolts under the rocker 
arms.  I know they're the easiest to get to but wouldn't this put  undue tilt 
to one side of the head if the hidden bolts don't get the same treatment? &gt;&gt;
Hi Ray,
Well so far this has not caused any problems for us in cracked heads, blow by 
&gt;from between the heads and cylinders, or oil leaks from the case side of the 
cylinders.  We find that at most one is retorqueing only about 2-4 Lbs..  We 
do remove the engine and strip it down to a longblock to retorque all 
fasteners on both case and heads at about 30,000-40,000 miles.  Which really 
needs it from what we have found.
Have been thinking that it would be interesting to retorque everything on the 
longblock at 300-500 miles and see what happens at the 30,000-40,000 strip 
down.
