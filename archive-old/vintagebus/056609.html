&gt;Better put some HUGE washers, or better yet a large heavy piece of metal &gt;on the back side of where ever you are bolting, and a LARGE number 8 grade
&gt;bolt, or those shoulder harnesses and belts are worthless.
------------------------------
Steel plate at least 1/8&quot; thick would be appropriate - 3/16&quot; or 1/4&quot; would be better.  About 2&quot; by 4&quot; or larger, to spread the force of a load over a wide area of the sheet metal.  Put a large radius on each corner; smooth and lightly radius all edges.  This will help prevent a sharp edge or corner from cutting into, or even piercing, the sheet metal under the load of a collision.

Mounting bolts should be a snug fit in the backing plates.  Use a large, heavy-duty washer under the bolt head or nut, sized to be a snug fit on the shank of the mounting bolt.  A lock washer wouldn't hurt.

After everything is pre-fitted and aligned, the backing plates can be bedded in your choice of stickum.  Epoxy works well, but even industrial-strength double-stick tape will do on a clean surface.  Not a safety issue - just keeps them in place when you pull the belts/harness for maintenance, etc.

Don't overlook all the other stuff inside your rig that will go flying about in a collision.  Visualize the effect of a toolbox, fire extinguisher, case of beverage, portable toilet, or some lumber crashing forward while the vehicle and attached occupants come to an abrupt stop.  Not a pleasant picture...
