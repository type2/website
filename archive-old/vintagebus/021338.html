Hello,

     Well, thanks to all the advice today my sick day was a success. I
got the bus greased. I got the non-working turn signals working. And, l
got the  windshield in!  Not a bad day for me being sick and all. The
worst part of the windshield was getting the rubber on the glass. The
rest was cake. Again, thanks for all the help. By the way I'm still
working on getting that mirror arm out. But that too will be done soon.
At least now I have an idea of how to approach it. Well, I've gotta get
out tonight and get some cruising in, this bad boy is now legal . Well
sort of.
