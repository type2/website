A source that's been around awhile with a funky website
now has their own site:  http://www.avp-worldwide_dot_com/
but it's still a funky website.  Funky, as in not much
info except pricing.  Call for details.

AVP is in Sacramento and has been doing VW engines for
quite a while now.  I had a chance to do some business
with them for my '80 Westy.  I mangled a head, and AVP
managed to weld it back together for me.  They understand
the problem of dropped seats in the 2L engines and more
importantly know what to do about it.  They even handle
engines for a 411 or 412, 40hp, but not 36.

If I needed an engine (and I might for my '67 Sqbk)
I would have no reservations about going there.

Anyone have any direct experiences with their engines?

Last time I checked (a few years ago) all they did was
stock engines, nothing fancy.
