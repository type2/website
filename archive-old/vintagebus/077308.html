Subject: Re: [VB] Update-CRRRRUUUUNNNCCHH- Toasted Tranny??

Well, I got real motivated last night and pulled the
troublesome tranny. When I drained it, there was a big
clump of metal shavings attached to the magnetic drain
plug, most of them as big or bigger than the end of a
typical pencil lead. When you turn either axle
spindle, there is a knocking noise that comes from
inside the tranny body, not out at the RGB's. So, I am
assuming this confirms my fear that this tranny is
toast?  So, so does anyone in the Midwest have an RGB
tranny for a 67 bus??
