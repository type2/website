  Check
&gt; with Jack Maynard who has a receipe for a thickener of the tranny oil so it

My &quot;Recipe&quot; comes from Wolfgang, who sold me a very nice rebuilt
steering gear. They recommend using 3 parts &quot;powerpunch&quot; brand gear oil
additive and one part black moly grease. These are stirred together and
then put in a squeeze bottle and slowly added to the steering box. This
is NOT a recipe for transmission oil! The powerpunch is available here
in the northwest. It is the consistency of honey, and is supposed to
make gear oil cling better to gears, and quiet noisy gearboxes. This
recipe for steering gear boxes uses it straight, however. 

Wolfsburg had one other product you could use instead of the powerpunch,
I think it was an stp gear oil additive, and again, used straight except
for the mixed in moly grease.

For what it is worth, I have never had to refil my steering gear
box....although filling it the first time took hours, the stuff is so
thick.
