&lt;&lt; Speaking of seat belts, does anybody know what the law reads on them....(I
 live in Oregon).  If they weren't there to begin with does the vehicle need
 them?  I'm all for safety but if you have to hack it up I'd rather not.  And
 if they are mandatory, what is the best route?
  &gt;&gt;

IN WA state they are mandatory from 72 or something, I recommend calling the 
high patrol in OR if you want to know the laws

I put seat belts in my 61 M 130 deluxe, not needed for legality, but I like 
to wear a seat belt.   used spring steel aka old torsion bars as washers so 
they wouldn't pull through in case of accident.
