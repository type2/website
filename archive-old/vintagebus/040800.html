Thought I'd chime in on this thread....In our 57 kombi with small nut tranny (not sure
what year, but not orig)going about 57-60mph we get around 27 MPG on the freeway, around
town we get about 19-21 MPG. We just made the round trip to sacramento ~700 mi round trip
and we avg 27 MPG. I've checked the speedo against a new car, and the mile markers on the
side of the road, and it's pretty darn close. No racks, but two adults and a child and
related gear for 3 days of camping....
