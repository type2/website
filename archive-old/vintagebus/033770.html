Since I started using real German clips I've never had one break


ronnie,  and even though I have the correct German rivets I still just use a
machine screw and nut to hold them on.

Got a good laugh out of this one!  Yeah,  I guess it's rather a moot point
but I do enjoy reading how everyone maintains their hubcap clips.  It's a
real issue as they break all the time and I've lot 2 vintage hubcaps down in
Kansas because of it.  They were originals too but I was too damn lazy to
fix the clips. I would actually lean out of the bus while at a stop light
and pound the hubcap back on.  Even did it while driving.   Shame on me.
The pop rivet idea is a great one and I _ALMOST_ did it for the quickness of
the installation.  But then I got these ideas of breaking a clip at a VW
show some place for from here and walking about trying to locate a pop rivet
and the tool.  Sure as hell ain't gonna buy one.  I figured I'd throw the
spare clips in the tool box and now all I need is a screw driver and my
loctite which goes with me anyway.

Funny how the simplest of topics generates the most traffic. :-)  At least
this time there weren't any flames.  :-)
