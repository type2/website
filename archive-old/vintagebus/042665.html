&gt; Thom, how was your bus brought in?
well,

the gist of it is tht any vehicle over 25 years old is exempt from safety
and emissions restrictions. This was hard for some people to believe so
here are the relevant links:

the guidelines, 
http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/import/gray0006.htm

the quote of interest from this page:
As a general rule, a motor vehicle less than 25 years old must comply with
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards (that means more
than 25 years old need not comply.)

the form you need to present to customs:
http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/import/hs799short.pdf

check box 1 on the form.

Hope this helps...

Steve
