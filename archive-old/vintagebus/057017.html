Subject: Tie fighters - clarification

&gt;Subject: Tie fighters are back!Message-ID: 
&gt;Driving around in the red 61 veedoubleyew microbus
&gt;through the snow.....  The 6V 
&gt;....snow swirls around like tie fighters attacking
&gt;the death star.

Actually Tie-Fighters and Tie-Interceptors defend the
death star.  The X-wings, B-wings, and Y-wings attack
the Death Stars.

I drove my double cab in the snow season when I lived
in Big Bear for two years.  The traction is awsome.  I
remember one time I was stuck, and my friends and I
shook our booty's in the cab and the movement was
enough to get us free.  I had broken windsheild wipers
so all I saw was the flakes like light speed coming at
me.  I coated the windows with Rain-x every week,
worked like magic.  I wore my snowboarding clothes
when I went to work.  Not often you see 4 dudeds in a
VW bundled up on their way to the moantain.  When I
went to school, down the hill, I would wear my
snowboarding jacket, a huge addidas jacket, my
snowbard gloves, a beanie.  Wow it was cold.  For some
reason many people didn't ask for me to drive.  I even
had sleeping bags for the passengers to cover up with.
 Oh well, saved gas money.
