&gt; Well, my custom '67 (ex-camper) is coming along. Now starting the interior.

&gt; headliner?

I have plans to re-do the headlining and down to the height of the
interior trim panels in the same slate grey crushed velour that the PO
of my '67 reupholstered the seats in, when I get to that stage of the
ressurection of the '63.
