Hi all,

I have a question concerning the replacement of my 1500 engine with a rebuilt
1600, possibly a turn key.  (single port or duel port) Most of my components,
carb etc.. seem to be at the end of the road.

1.) 	Pros/Cons of a S.P. / D.P.?

2.)	I'd like to find a rebuilt 1500, yet I am looking for this swap to be as
$$ painless as possible. I would like the outward appearance of the engine to
be as close to stock as possible.

3.)	Is the existing offset air filter etc. compatible with a 1600 setup ? What
about sticking with the non doghouse oil cooler?  Cooling tin conversion
problems?

4.)	I am somewhat new to this bus stuff, my 1500 is old and tired (told by
P.O. she is on her 3rd rebuild), any tips on where to find a good rebuilt
engine would be helpful.  Money is somewhat an issue,  but I do need to drive
her on a regular basis. Trying to keep that &quot; original&quot; look about her.


Thanks all,

Jeff 1964 Sundial
