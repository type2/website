Hey,

Nice find. It looks like the second one is snuggled
down, ready for a nap. someone needs to wake it up
before it goes into permanent hibernation. ;0) Good
Luck!

Have a great day!

&gt; Then today I followed a lead and found (2) Double
&gt; Door busses!!! 
&gt; They've been there a LONG time. He says ones a '58
&gt; and ones a '57. 
&gt; Don't know for sure. They are early ones though.
&gt; Here's pictures:

&gt; 
&gt; Take a look at the wheels on the second one and
&gt; it'll give you an 
&gt; idea how long it's been there!
