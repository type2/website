Actually, it's some time mid-70's when they changed, I think when they
went to the type4 motor and the smaller engine lid.

I tried that - there weren't a lotta loafs, and the hinges that
were there had the same issues mine had :(

&gt; engine lid hinges are the same thru 79...
&gt; 
&gt; just go to your local boneyard and find a nice set off a loaf.
