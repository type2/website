Subject: Re: Wiper Stuff

Thanks for the wiper arm info everyone, on and off list.  I just want my bus
to be safe to drive in the rain!  I'll try some rain-ex or similar on the
windscreen as well.  This bus won't be show vehicle any time soon, rather a
daily driver to be used and enjoyed.  I bought it because it has a solid
underbelly and has been reasonably unmolested in it's past.

While I'm new to split-windows I do have a fair bit of experience in
late-model bay-windows.  I just don't want to make assumptions with the
splittie :)
