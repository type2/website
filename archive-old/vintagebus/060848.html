Subject: competition/celestial meddling

i think jon and i are in some sort of buying competition.

last sunday, the day after jon left on his cross-country journey, i agreed to buy a ghia.  i was originally going to say that because he got a 1958 westy two weeks ago, i had to have a 1958 too.  however it seems that there is something else going on all together.

saturday when talking to the ghia's current owner, we discussed how the &quot;bus snob&quot; is a misnomer as ever since jon brought his buses to the house, the property has become more a &quot;little hanover&quot; than a &quot;little wolfsburg&quot; as the backyard once was called.

a little more than a year ago the property was littered with wolfsburg productions (not all mine), beetle and bus, 1956 to 1951, some of them just making the yard a home while they got ready to drive again, a sort of half-way house.  currently we've got all these hanover buses on the property and they're outnumbering the wolfsburg volkswagens.

now i am given to understand that monday jon entered negotiations on yet another bus.  maybe jon's working as a personal mechanic to a fleet of barndoors has made him yearn for ribbed bumpers, bubble taillights and round transmission carriers.  maybe my recent near complete lack of wrenching has affected me in some way i can't name.

perhaps it's not competition but a matter of some celestial forces working to bring about the return of &quot;little wolfsburg&quot; to the backyard with the addition of a 1958 ghia and a 1955/56 (wolfsburg transmission carrier) kombi/camper.

well whatever, buying competition or celestial forces, it is a mystery to me.  the only thing i am certain of is that everyone i know who doesn't understand this vw habit thinks we're crazy.

cheers,
