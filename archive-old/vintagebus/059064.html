Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I was under the impression that the Type 1 distributors still had the #3
timing retard even after the introduction of the doghouse cooling system.
Is that not correct?  While it is desirable for early engines how many
people know that you lose it when going to a pertronix or compufire which is
another popular mod?

009s also do not have the #3 retard that is nice on early engines
(pre-doghouse).
