thanks, this helps
&gt;  
&gt;  having just installed backup light wiring on 3 VWs, I remember this. 
&gt;  
&gt;  from the hot side of the coil (where the wire from the front goes, #15) a

&gt;  black wire goes right, then gets a inline fuse.  The fuse is important as
it 
&gt;  will blow if there is a short somewhere.  Then it disappeares forward. 
it 
&gt;  runs to the front of the tranny wher ethe switch is, then another wire
goes 
&gt;  back from the tranny and hooks up to the wires that takes it to the
reverse 
&gt;  lights.
&gt;  
&gt;  well, you have to have a switch on the nose cone of the tranny, which was
67 
&gt;  half year only, though I know they made them later.  I put nose cones
with 
&gt;  switches in my 65 and 61, cause I wanted to add reverse lights (bug style

&gt;  ones attached to the bumper at the left side.  If some PO swapped the
trans 
&gt;  and you have no switch, then you have no switch.
