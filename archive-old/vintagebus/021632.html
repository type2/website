&lt;&lt; Thanks for the info.  As I said, it's just in the trial stages.  I don't
know
 about the moisture from exhaling in the van, never gave it a thought.  I am
 not sure how much that will really mean here as contrary to the area you are
 in, a high humidity day here is 20%.  Most of the time it is in the low teens
 and everything &quot;appears&quot; to evaporate very rapidly.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
No problem you are welcome.  The thing is that buses unless driven with the
windows open/missing or sunroof open at all outside temps create there own
weater inside.  Once the differance between the warmth of the interior reaches
a certain point higher than the outside temp the water vapor begins to
condense.  So unless you live somewhere where lovers lane has no fogged
windows, you will have rust problems due to using materials that collect
moisture and holds them against the steel of your VW. 
 Hope we do not come across to badly, but we want to help keep as many buses
on the road as possible.  It would be fun to own a Tucker, but not as fun as
owning a VW.  How many times do you think they have a swap meet or news
letters, or just bump into each other during travels?  Since there were only
50 made and all but one is in running condition.  Same thing happened to the
Split Window newsletter.  Once these automobiles had pretty much been bought
up and restored there was not enough interest in keeping a newsletter and club
running.  Eric &amp; Barb
