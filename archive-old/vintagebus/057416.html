Not always true.  The airflow in the back of the bus is pretty hard to
define without a wind tunnel.


  The point was to provide additional cooling while
&gt; at stop lights etc when there would be minimal outside air/vehicle movement.
&gt; The sump is the closet part of the engine to the road.  On a nice 100+
&gt; degree day stopped at a long light on a black road at high noon I'm guessing
&gt; the temperature 12&quot; off the road would be higher than that of the air coming
&gt; off the cylinders.  Even if it isn't, it only needs to be as cool or cooler
&gt; than the sump to be effective.

That air is pretty hot coming off of the heads!  I'd much rather have
ambient air on the sump then air from the heads.
