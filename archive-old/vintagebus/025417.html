Hi Brad
Fuel gauge woes aren't that bad.  Whilst the engine's out, it's a good idea to
clean the sender contacts.  Just remember which went where.  You can do a simple
test with an ohm meter on the sending unit.  The hard part is moving the float.
I suppose you could pull the unit, just be ready to manufacture needed gaskets.
You can also check the condition of the float whilst the senders out.  I've had
some not so great experiences with modern gas and 60's era German fuel floats on
my bikes.  If the sender tests out ok and the connections are clean at the
sender then do a continuity test up the wires to the gauge.  If that tests out
then ensure the fuse the fuel gauge runs on is ok.  On second thought, do that
first as it's often the simplest things that cause the most irritating
troubles.

The oil temp gauge should work it it's installed as per the manufacturer.
Unless you live somewhere the climate is such that the engine oil never warms
up.  Again, check power and wiring.

As far as additional gauges, some folks like head temp sensors but how many
gauges do you really want to have to look at?  Oil temp is a fair indicator of
how hard your engine's working, and also it's mechanical condition.  The only
other one I run is oil pressure just because I don't trust lights, and
redundancy in this case is good.

My philosophy is that the Tinkertoy is so simple and I really prefer as much
simplicity as I can get in today's world.  Mote stuff to look at = more stuff to
maintain.

&gt; Ok. Figured out that I have seized bearing on #3. Am planning on a complete
&gt; bottom end rebuild, so I'm prepared for the worst, and whatever happens
&gt; won't be as bad if i was more of an optimist. Anyhow, while I'm in the empty
&gt; engine room, and the engine is out, I want to take this time to add some
&gt; things. What gauges should definitely be added? I have an oil temp gauge but
&gt; something tells me it doesn't work, as I have never saw it move. I read in
&gt; the archive (my browser is sending me invalid page faults or I'd be there
&gt; now) to add an oil pressure gauge as well, but what else? And how hard are
&gt; these to hook up for your average up and coming bus doctor? Also, my gas
&gt; gauge doesnt work. Is there a procedure to run, and see if it is either my
&gt; sender or the gauge itself? Thanks for any help, and I really hope to be on
&gt; the road soon.
