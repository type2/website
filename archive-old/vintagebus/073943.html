&gt; No in the fuse box I am putting together...there are the connections that 
&gt; are kind of riveted together...I am trying to solder this connection. Then 
&gt; there is the area of contact where the two metal pieces &quot;squeeze&quot; into the black 
&gt; fuse box  thingy...should I solder here as well after reconnecting 
&gt; everything...i have been hesitant to do it this way, incase there area ever any 
&gt; problems with it...it would be rather difficult to take apart to reassemble.

Hi Kevin,
Where the clips are pressed/clipped into the fuse box is where alot of 
voltage drop happens so that is where you need to solder them together.  We can 
understand your concerns about being able to dissassemble these later, but the 
only thing that could go wrong would be to have the plastic of the fuse box 
crack, break, or melt and then removing the clips will be a simple break plastic 
and remove clips if you are putting them in another post-1960 fuse box body.  As 
is when the clips loosen heat occurs and the plastic of the fuse box body 
sags and soon does not work.  Modern replacement fuse boxes have plastic that is 
nowhere near heat resistant as the OG ones!!!!
