&lt;&lt; Whoa Andre - those tie rods looks to me like they are bent big time because
 look at the tie rod where it connects to the spindle.  The tie rod is jacked
 up at an angle instead of sitting parallel to where it mounts to the
 spindle.  I wonder if this was someone's lame out way of adjusting the front
 end?  If you go to http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/67bus/67busupdate2. &gt;&gt;

When I got my 59 someone had turned the spindles upside down and switched the 
sides in order to lower the bus. They're prefered method of tierod adjust 
ment was to beat the hell out of em too. one is even cracked and welded.
