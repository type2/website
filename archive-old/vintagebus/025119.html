Hey!
Just a note to tell y'all what's up.  The tinkertoy's running better
than ever.  Since last spring when you might remember my appearing on
the list, we've accomplished the following  (I say WE because you guys
have been with me the whole time):
Replaced engine with off the shelf long block.  That had the attendant
oil cooler diverter plate leak.  We suffered through no reverse due to
my trying to apply f#^d shift pattern to a VW.  A couple 'heated
discussions' about electrical boojums. A recurring loose head that
resulted in a burned head, looked like someone took a cutting torch to
it.  A new head and 3 retorques later the valves don't change in 1500
miles (yes, I do check).  A ground fault problem in an electronic
ignitor module that acted like a gummed up carburetor until I had the
opportunity to LISTEN to my bus as it did it's best to go down the
road.  Discussions about carb settings, the stock works really well with
a 1600 sp and 009 dizzy.  Tighten the red box mount bolts like someone
suggested to get rid of the annoying CLUNK when engaging in a direction
opposite from what we were traveling in.  Replaced 2 tie rod ends and
tightened the steering box.  I now have a bus sans 'wanders'.

And so after I post this, I will unsubscribe to the list.  Not because
I'm using you and then discarding, far from it.  You see, the Coast
Guard has seen fit after 7 months of tropical hell in Miami to send me
someplace much cooler.  That's cooler to be in NOT temperature.  In 1
week, the Tinkertoy, rosebushes, Ghidorah the Iguana, Peekaboo the
parrot, Skye the parakeet, Buford D. Katt, and BJ Dogg (oh yeah wife &amp; 2
kids) depart Miami enroute Charleston SC.  We won't all be in the
tinkertoy, to maintain some semblance of sanity the wife will drive the
familymobile with part of the above mentioned load, probably the dog and
a kid, maybe Buford if he wants Air conditioned comfort.  So of course
you'll see a trip report.  Any listees in the Charleston area?

Keep an eye out for us if you're on the road next weekend (1 may).  Look
for a blue &amp; white 67 with Maine plates.

You can p-mail me for the next week to Arborman_at_hotmail_dot_com.

So happy trails to you all and thanks for all the fish (or something
like that).  See y'all in 2 weeks with tales of adentures.
Dave
