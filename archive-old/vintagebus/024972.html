Dave,

Calm down 8^). Go drive the bus around a little and get reconnected
with reality (bus content).
This isn't real. It's just wild rumors. Your congressional rep.
probably has a web site listing upcomming legislation. Go check it
out, you won't find anything like this listed. You won't find anything
about this on CNN's site either. I got this same email a while ago and
checked into it a little. I hope I have saved you (all) some time.
