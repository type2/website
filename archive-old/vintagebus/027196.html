             I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an
old transmission, and using that, but it's not real clear to me how you do that
without having the entire transmission housing hanging out there, or doing an awful
lot of cutting through thick metal.  Suggestions?

I built a test stand out of an old gutted tranny... some scrap metal I had laying
around... &amp; the top of a 74 stupid beetle... dont ask:) got a pic if your
interested. It took a whole Saturday to build it.... VERY handy to have around. &amp;
to think I used to start em on the ground.....
