&gt;&gt;&gt;My old 60 deluxe BUS (bus content) never came with seatbelts, I got a
fix it 
&gt;&gt;&gt;ticket for that along with 13 different other things.
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO speedometer
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO ebrake
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO taillights
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO headlights
&gt;&gt;&gt;CRACKED windshield
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO bumpers
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO proof of insurance in car.
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO proof of registration in car.
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO drivers licesne in car
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO seatbelts
&gt;&gt;&gt;NO turnsignals
&gt;&gt;&gt;And a few other things.....
&gt;&gt;&gt;i got EVERYTHING written off but the seatbelts.....judge told me to shut
up 
&gt;&gt;&gt;before he put me in jail. After that i paid the 35$ fine and drove away.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe I should have saved this for friday?


Or maybe you shouldn't have been driving the damn thing in that condition
in the first place?
