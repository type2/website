So this VW dealer that I met has his dealers microfiche set up.  He has =
the machine and all of the sheets that the machine reads.  He asked me =
if I was interested in buying it - but I'm not. He does have some VW =
tools though that I hope to buy.  Like a puller for the rear hubs,  and =
a tool for removing kingpins - but he is missing pieces - if he finds =
them  - yip pee.

Anyway, what kinda value does this microfiche set-up have?  He started =
business in 1960 as a VW dealer and he had a buyer for the dealership =
when he wanted to retire but VW Canada didn't approve of his potential =
buyer - too bad for him - he lost tons o' money.=20
