How about a secret handshake, or a catch phrase like &quot;My grandma dated Heinz 
Nordhoff&quot; that we could casually drop in conversation to discover who the 
listees are...

maybe this isn't such a good idea right now with the police state thread 
going around...

&gt;&quot;Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag
&gt;I have seen ,,, see me at the Yellow bus at 10..  etc,, but what if the
&gt;Yellow Bus is forced to stay in the parking lot and the Listee walks right
&gt;by you,,, you'd never know..
&gt;So ,, My question, is there a  &quot;Hi , My Name is  Mr Bus Driver &quot;   tag
&gt;available?  :-)
