Subject: Friday Topic; No VW Content! FS Hazet for Harley Davidson
Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2000 09:47:21 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

As many of you know I collect Hazet and VW Service Tools.
Currently in my possession I have one Harley Davidson Tool kit made by Hazet,
2460/19. Its complete with all 19 tools in the original black linen roll. There
are common as well as specialty tools. This kit was manufactured in 1998. I'd
like to sell or trade it for VW tools. Price is $150, I'm sure about half of
what Baum would charge you, if they even could get it. If you bought it I'm sure
you'd own the only one in the country. I used to ride an old Electroglide and I
know this would have saved my butt a time or two.

Act quick because if I don't hear by the end of the day I'm going to donate to
the local Harley Club for there summer raffle.

Sorry for the non bus content

Ty
