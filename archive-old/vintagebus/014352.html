&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Not sure we would want to try this bit of your heat riser manifold
&gt; procedure.
&gt; One would never be totally sure that the silicon would stay sealed.
&gt; If it 
&gt; did ever leak the carbonmonoxide would be sucked into the heater
&gt; system 
&gt; almost directly.  Therefore we would reccomend after drilling either
&gt; tapping 
&gt; and pluging these holes with screws or bolts or just welding them
&gt; shut.

The silicone is mostly for redundancy.  The hose clamp has a &quot;plain&quot;
portion that is a very tight fit over the round heat riser pipe.  Most
of the silicone is squeezed out in the process.  When I disassemble it,
the silicone has always sealed perfectly (no signs of leakage at all).

I trust the hose clamp a lot more than I trust the flanged connections
on the ends of the risers, at least until I file them flat! :)
