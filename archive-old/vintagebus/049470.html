Subject: Re: [VB] Do many find the Original Owner?

I have tracked the 70 back to the late 70s... that family doesn't remember
who the (deceased) father bought it from, and TexAss refuses to look any
further back - &quot;It was too much money to keep the paper title originals,
but we threw all the old stuff out. And  we had it on microfiche, but  we
threw all those out, too.&quot;

Remeber kids: Low Taxes, Low services.
Not looking forward to how far back the single cabs records go............
