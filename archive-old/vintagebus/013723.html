Hi all,

My autobody man down near Dallas,TX is pluggin' away on my 1959 Double Cab
and just called to let me know that he needs a piece of sheet metal for the
bus.  So is anyone out there parting out a '58-'62 Bus with the round tail
lights?  If so, we need to locate the sheet metal piece all the way around
the passenger side taillight assembly.  Long ago my Bus had been hit in the
rear right side corner and repaired by the PO.  The repair they made was to
pound out the metal to as close to straight as possible and fill with
(quite a bit of) Bondo.  This is a Truck, and we don't need the whole
corner (although I'd buy one if an entire pick-up corner is available). 
This piece could come from any type of model of '58-'62 Bus.  What my body
guy asked me to locate is a straight, unwrecked piece of the passenger side
taillight area with as much metal all the way around the taillight opening
as possible.  Yes, he could make up a patch piece, but he would prefer to
patch the area with the real thing in nice condition, used or NOS,
whatever!

Thanks for checking your stash, and if you've got something that might help
us out, please contact me off-list at my e-mail address or (314) 949-2455. 
I'm looking forward to getting this Transporter back on the road again next
year!
