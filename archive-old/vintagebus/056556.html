Subject: Busware truck canopys, pics posted / webbing colors

I put up some up close pics of Listmember Tom buese new truck canopy's that
hes making/selling. Go here if you want to check em out.

As far as the green webbing straps that were discussed (like tom is using),
Every og literature that I have on my site and that I have seen, shows very
dark (green?, Dark brown?) webbing straps. If you look on my site, the 6
1959 and newer adds with canvas all have *definitely* darker webbing straps
( some color, some B&amp;W) , whereas the 1 pre-59 add I have *appears* to have
tan. Perhaps it was a changed in 59 to darker straps, since that was the
most &quot;used&quot; aspect  of the canvas and it was easily dirtied.
I know of one 58 SC bought from the original owner with the og tilt, and It
had tan straps that matched the canvas. So the change must've happened
after that (if there was one). Oer maybe there were multiple suppliers?
I have never seen an og canvas in person that had anything besides tan
webbing straps.
