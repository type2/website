Subject: Re: [VB] 59' model year questions

Ah... remember that VW did not wait till the model year change to make 
changes. most changes were at odd times.

Early 59s had splitcase trannies and 36hp motors.

crashbox trannies had no synchros and were last used in buses in early 53

tunnel case trannies and bastard 40hps were used in late 59s.

you can put a 1600 in it either way. if it was a 36hp bus the wiggle to get 
the heater boxes in is tricky, but doable.   Use small diameter heater boxes or 
adaptor pipes as the bus has small heater tubes (up through 64?)  

VW said they didn't have crank aprons, but the on dit is they did through 
36hp.    early 59 i had had a crank apron. (and a 1500 w/ heat, later bumpers)   
Think a few very early 59s had stamped bumpers, most the sturdy bumpers.

Hi
couple of questions about the 59 model year:

did they have the 36hp ? was the 40hp an option ?
did they have the crank start apron?
did they all have the &quot;crashbox&quot; ( non syncro ) trannies?
can you put a 160o in and run heaterboxes ( i don't know anything about the 
36hp heater boxes) ?

did the &quot;newer&quot; style (not pressed) come in mid year or were they on all 59' 
buses ( I guess that would mean late 58' production vehicles? ) ?

are there any distinct 59' things?

thanks
