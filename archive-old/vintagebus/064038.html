Subject: Re: [VB] high pressure/Oil filter/cold issues

&gt; Is there a relief valve to bypass the filter when the pressure is too
&gt; high?  If not, there should be one built into the filter.  Perhaps the
&gt; filter isn't the right one?

The bypass valve in an oil filter only bypasses the filter media, the
pressure inside the filter will remain the same.  The bypass would have to
be before the filter if it were to help with overpressurizing the filter.
