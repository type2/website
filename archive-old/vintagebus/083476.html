Subject: Has anybody rechromed their bumpers?

Hello again,

  Has anybody recently rechromed their bumpers by any chance?  Mine are from
a 67 and have overriders.   I'm trying to get a ballpark for what I'm
looking at?  Over the phone, a Hawaii guy gave me a $1000 ballpark estimate.
That sounds nuts to me?  Should I just ship them mainland and find someone
there?  Any recommendations?  

Aloha,  --J
