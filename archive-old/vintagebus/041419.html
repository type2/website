Hey Joe,
I've been some, but not from the early days.  I think four times.
&gt; Questions from a Jerome Virgin:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. I'm clueless as to what to bring, camping/eatingwise.  Tent, sleeping
&gt; bag, water, freezedried apricots - it would help if I knew what, if any,
&gt; facilities are at the campground.  I realize a lot of what I bring
&gt; depends on who I hook up with, but a general picture would be helpful.
Well if you have to fly, don't bring too much.  People are pretty
generous.  Free beer and Tacos at Ronnie and VWHoward's
area.  Facilities are portapotties.   That's it.  Doesn't hurt to bring
extra TP just in case.  If you have to tent it there are plenty of other
people doing that too.  There's usually a bunch of them crazy kids in
slammed type 3s that have to use a tent or just pass out wherever.:)
Water, sunscreen if you are a whitey like me, and shade are good things
to bring. (I use a wide brimmed hat) It's hot.  It's cool.  It can rain
hard.

&gt; 2. Do people bring toys to share?  Stuff to swap?  Or is it mainly
&gt; communing, arrhythmic drumming, griping about what a safety nazi Thom
&gt; Fitzpatrick is?  All that's cool, just wanting an idea.
All of the above except the griping about Thom. Maybe we can start a new
tradition.  Maybe Thom should give up some money time for some free time
to defend himself.:) Uncle Jerry tends to bring quite a few toys. In the
Jeromes I have attended there have been the drums, a case burn, and don't
forget the good old-fashioned sit around the campfire penis piercing. Last
year Don drove his Harley through a DD panel. You just don't know what
will happen there, but most people seem to have a good time. There are
some great vendors there.  Ronnie, Rex, Uncle Jerry, ABC sells those
psychedelic tie-dye t-shirts. you can get souveniers of your first time.     

I'm not for sure I'm going yet.I can bring you some food if I go.  I
always seem to go.  
Barry, JP, usually cook up some corn, green chilies on the fire.  You
won't go hungry around that place.  You'll survive, just be ready for the
elements.  
Maybe you'll win a bus to drive back.
ABC does quite a job of it, and the money goes to a good cause.
Take a tour of Don's place up on the hill.  It's about $5 I think.  If you
work on VWs, you will have a great deal of appreciation for
the trucks he has restored.    
Once you're done with Jerome come on over to Route66 Splits little get
together and watch the balloons.  Oct 6&amp;7 $10 for two nights camping
3miles from the Balloon park.  More info- http://onearth_dot_com/busshow/
