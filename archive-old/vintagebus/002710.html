Thom,
While looking at Rusty VanBondo's 54
BarnAmbuCamper type thingie last
weekend, amidst all of the other BarnAmbuCamper
only parts, I noticed that
he has the antennae of which you speak. The front
view on your vintagebus
page shows it. There is also a little chrome hole
button under it like the
antennae is now screwed into the hole for the
safari wiper duck, which it
doesn't have. It is bent in the half inch-or-so
long solid portion at the
bottom of the shaft. This portion is only about
1/8 inch in diameter, while
the rest is 1/4 inch or so. The top mount doesn't
show in the picture very
well and it is on the ambulance only vent scoop.
Have been told it was off a
split-oval bug.

&gt;
&gt;It is
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it one of the Bosche antennias?  I worked a
Bill's shop so know the
&gt;&gt; antennia you are talking about.  Is there a
thinner metal area just above
the
&gt;&gt; lower base at the bottom of the antennia shaft?
If so this area is
designed
&gt;
&gt;Actually it does, it's like a little notch.  I
never figured on *bending*
&gt;the antenna!  Any other time I'd had that
happend, it wasn't pretty....
