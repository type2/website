&lt;&lt; *Tar... Is this really roofing patch cement, brand name Henry? I don't have
a tar pot to heat and mop the 'real' tar on, and would be a messy job in the
ceiling. Suspect the Henry patch has petroleum distillates, but should be out-
gassed by the time I get the other stuff in/on. Same stuff used to seal
windows, Eric?&gt;&gt;
Yes, we just bought another 5 gallon can of Henry 108 Asphalt Roof Coating And
Lap Cement, Non-fibered, Brush Grade, Solvent Based.  We have no problem if we
take it inside and let it get room temperature over night above 60 F., then it
brushes (Using cheap paint brushes.) nice and thin.  If you want it thinner
you could always mix in some kerosene, but would be worried about going too
far with that, might result in it never drying.

&lt;&lt;  Another question, will it melt and drip from the ceiling during our 110f
heat? Guess I'll have to read a can &amp; report back.&gt;&gt;
The trick is to just use enough of it for the job and avoid applying it too
thickly.  If you have a wrecking yard near you go out and inspect the 1970s
bugs for the sound deadening pad (A square piece of roofing felt with four
circles cut into it!) roofing tarred to the center of the inside of the door
skins.  If they are still there they must not have problems melting off in
your weather.  So far we have found all of these up here still in place after
20+ years and at least some of these bugs must have spent a time in your kind
of hot weather!
   Also have been thinking (Scarry is it not!) that duplicating the type 1
floor sound deadeners would not be all that hard.  They were just two layers
of roofing felt with a layer of styrofoam in between.  We would just glue the
three layers together with roofing tar and this would be better than just
styrofoam.  If the sound deadener ever needed to be removed to access the
sheet metal behind it the roofing felt would strengthen the styrofoam to
pulling it off.  After painting the sheet metal thinly then apply spots of
roofing tar to the edges and corners as glue on the duplicated type 1 sound
deadeners and Walla Walla Washington it should do the job of both sound
deadening and add insulation value to vehicle that already has problems
heating it's interior during the cold weather below 40F.  Eric &amp; Barb
