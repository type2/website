Why do you want to change it?  Do you have a specific accessory you need to
power?  Are you having trouble starting it sometimes?  If you aren't having
any problems, I don't really see a need to change it.  Unless, OTOH, you are
doing a complete restoration and need to purchase a new electrical system
(generator/alternator, battery, lights, clutch, etc.)
