&gt;griding gears.  I found out why...I was clutching with the middle of my foot

I am a tall guy too and that is the only way I can clutch any 50 to 79 Bus
so I set the 
clutch  so I dont  have to push the pedal all the way to the floor against
the advice of 
my friends,
They say adjusting it tight like that is supposed to be not good for the
clutch 
since it might slip but I dont have problems with that.
