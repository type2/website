Subject: The '66 Deluxe is home

Hi Volks,
Finally got the '66 Deluxe home today.  It was 97 degrees in Virginia
and steamy!  The PO was a life saver by spending a couple hours helping
me drag the bus out of the pole barn and loading it up on the trailer.
After 22 years of resting, the bus shifted against on of the wall.  I am
pleased to say that we got the bus out unscarred.  I said my good-byes
and was given the original VA title.  With a big grin on my face, I
headed out with the splittie in tow.  I-95 was crazy in the morning so I
decided to take the scenic route home.  On the way I got several waves
and peace signs.  I stopped at Mc D's to grab a bite and ended up
spending an hour talking with several people who were gawking at the
bus.  I enjoyed every minute.  I saw on bay widow bus on RT. 33 about
mile maker 131, is this anyone on the list?  The rest of the trip was
uneventful, with the exception of the Massive storms blowing through
Delaware.  I can't wait to start cleaning tomorrow!  Here some pics of
the bus on the trailer.
