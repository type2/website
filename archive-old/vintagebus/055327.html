Subject: Re: [VB] Jay's question on Winter Driving

Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I drive
one of my busses every day, unless I'm off to pick up
another one with my 1955 Ch&amp;vy and trailer.  Of
course, I do have more than one...

JP

Hoping to have one more (singlecab) this coming week
after Busses and Balloons.  And due to that, my 1966
Grateful Dead bus (no rust or engine) is for sale! 
(And a 1974 hardtop Westy, too.)
