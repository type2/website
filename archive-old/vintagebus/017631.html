Just a comment: I live in Napa.  Most terrifying thing I've been in. 
Half the city had major problems, the other half - you could barely tell.
 I lost a lot of valuable glass (Thank god not my stash of pre'62
taillights!) and ceramics.  A storage area in my garage that hangs over
my '59 Beetle nearly dropped a couple boxes on the hood, but I didn't
have any problems there.  Thanks for the concern.
