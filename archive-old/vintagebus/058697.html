Subject: Re: [VB] 8v battery instead of 6v???

Damn good idea.  This was a 12 volt tranny with my to-be-installed split 
case tranny sittin on the garage floor still.  To get the thing to mate, I 
took the brass bushing out and left the aluminum piece in there thinking it 
would be good enough for testing it out knowing there was some wobble.  I 
will see if I can find a 6v bushing and see what she does.  Thanks and 
thanks to all the others for their hints.  Maybe 6v aint so bad after all 
....

&gt;
&gt;How's the starter BUSHING in the trans case? The
&gt;starter relies upon it for support to keep things
&gt;centered, and if the bushing is worn even a brand-new
&gt;starter will drag and have less power. Simple to
&gt;change with the engine out or you can remove it from
&gt;the starter side (either with the &quot;correct&quot; tool or a
&gt;tap - tap through the bushing and when it bottoms out
&gt;against the engine case it'll climb right out).
&gt;There's also a correct tool for driving the new one
&gt;in, but you can improvise with a bolt and nut. Not
&gt;feeling that adventurous? At least see if putting a
&gt;dab of grease in the bushing helps any.

&gt; &gt; OK, for the specific problem that is not related to
&gt; &gt; brighter lights, etc.
&gt; &gt; What actually got the marbles rolling in my head was
&gt; &gt; I have this 36hp I was
&gt; &gt; trying to start the other night.  Picked it up at
&gt; &gt; the rama swap last year
&gt; &gt; and it has sat who knows how long. I am just curious
&gt; &gt; to see if it runs and
&gt; &gt; how well.  The end play is not excessive so I was
&gt; &gt; thinking of running it in
&gt; &gt; one of my busses as is till I get around to
&gt; &gt; rebuilding it.   The problem is,
&gt; &gt; I have three 6v starters, one a new rebuilt bosch,
&gt; &gt; brand new 6v battery full
&gt; &gt; charge and the thing turns over slow.  Slow as in
&gt; &gt; relation to 12v.  It hits
&gt; &gt; here and there, but it just seems like 6v just turns
&gt; &gt; it over too slow to
&gt; &gt; start it. I tried all three starters with the same
&gt; &gt; results and the battery
&gt; &gt; is full charged. Now I tried squirting some WD-40 in
&gt; &gt; the cyliders to see if
&gt; &gt; that would speed things up and no it didnt.  I am
&gt; &gt; jumping the solenoid at
&gt; &gt; the starter, not going thru the key.  I am 6v dumb
&gt; &gt; (amongst other things as
&gt; &gt; I am sure you will let me know) as I have never ran
&gt; &gt; it, not sure how fast
&gt; &gt; they are supposed to turn the motor over.  Maybe if
&gt; &gt; I checked the 6v RPM
&gt; &gt; while trying to start it someone could tell me if it
&gt; &gt; was correct and my
&gt; &gt; problem lies in the other 20 - 30 potential problems
&gt; &gt; it could be why it is
&gt; &gt; not starting.  I will letcha know the RPM tonight :)
&gt; &gt; Thanks.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is one of those old backyard hacks.  Fix
&gt; &gt; what's actually
&gt; &gt; &gt;wrong with your existing electrical system, rathern
&gt; &gt; than hacking
&gt; &gt; &gt;it.  What specific problem are you trying to
&gt; &gt; rectify?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A camaro enthusiest friend of mine has a stock
&gt; &gt; early 60's VW.  He said
&gt; &gt; &gt;his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanic installed a 8 volt battery (interstate)
&gt; &gt; and adjusted his
&gt; &gt; &gt;voltage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulator to just over 8v so he would have some
&gt; &gt; extra boost.  I looked
&gt; &gt; &gt;at my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 36hp's 6v regulator and did not see a way of
&gt; &gt; adjusting voltage.  Anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything of using 8 volt battery and the
&gt; &gt; particulars??  TIA
