Just to clear this up I think you mean Joe or Steve. There is no John. However
there is a Ryan, and a Mike.

I myself go to the extreme when lowering a Bus, narrowed beam, spindles AND
adjusters, properly geared tranny with *no* RGB's, boomerangs, etc. But for
someone what wants it simple I would recommend dropped spindles in the front
(nice drop, with a smooth ride) and depending on your wallet, either an IRS
conversion or a straight axle kit in the rear. From my experience both are going
to give you freeway drive ability, but the IRS will give you a much nicer
driving experience.

Rack and pinion I'd like to see pictures of myself. To avoid the nasty steering
box drag in my lowered Buses I relocate the steering box. This takes alot of
work, including cutting down the column itself...

As for putting the wheel / tires on in the back of a lowered Bus. I unbolt the
axle from the spring plate, mount the wheel, etc. to the drum, then swing
everything up into position and bolt it up.

To lower your Bus for the day (photo shoot) jack it up, pull the wheels, set the
Bus on the ground, and stick the wheels up in the fender wells. Take your
pictures and reverse the procedure. I've seen alot of these &quot;lowered&quot; Buses in
the misc. galleries on the 'net. Amusing to say the least.
