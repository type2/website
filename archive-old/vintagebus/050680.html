Subject: (Friday) Don't forget... Was Header woes

Don't forget to tighten all your lug nuts after rotations, tire changes, brake
jobs.  First ride for my roommate in my bus and the rear wheel falls off.  Had
to jog back about a block to find my wheel in the middle of the road.  Worst
part is its the third time in my VW history that I've been responsible for
tightening my lug nuts and my wheel has fallen off.

Keep um coming, it's Friday,
Aaron

&gt; &gt;garage door!

&gt; drove my recently-acquired bus and rack over to the PO's apartment... into
&gt; the parking bay. which was angled. got it in a ways, heard a BOOM, looked
&gt; in the rearview mirror and watched the spare tire suddenly drop into view
&gt; about 30 feet across the lot. it was really cartoon-like :)
&gt; PO and i spent 2 hours nailing the roof of the garage back onto the joists.
&gt; slightly twisted the front legs of the rack, but was easily fixed.
