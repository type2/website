You gotta know that I'm kidding...  =)

Back in the day the (steering wheel) Spinner knobs
used to be called Necker's knobs. &quot;Necking&quot; defined as
ancient vernacular for making out, sucking face,
kissing, pitching woo, etc.
Put them on the steering wheel of the '40 Ford with
the auto tranny and you could keep your arm around
Betty Lou and still turn the wheel with one hand.
They are outlawed partially due to the general cheap
construction quality. Have the knob pop off of the
pivot point and have your '40 Ford crash into James
Dean coming the other direction. Then they'd write
teen songs like &quot;Last Kiss&quot; about your dead behind.
