&lt;&lt; 5ft tall tanks are heavy, and awkward to move....and if you drop it and 
bust that regulator....yup.) &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
This is why we always install the valve cover before moving!  Then once to 
the work area, or transport in our bus we keep these inert gass bottles laid 
on thier side.  Do not ever do this with acetylene gas bottles!  If you do 
for transport only make sure to let the acetylene bottle set upright for 
double the time it laid sideways up to two days for one or more days or risk 
instant explosion when opening the valve.  We have modified a hand cart/truck 
for our oxy/acetlene bottle to keep them upright as much as possible.  Have 
recently found a wide, flat wheeled gollf bag cart for sale that works 
fantasticly for the inert bottles for moving them around, and this cart folds 
up in a nice tight bundle that is easy to transport also.  Costs about $40.00 
at Fred Meyer's stores, and we got ours at a second hand shop for $7.00.
