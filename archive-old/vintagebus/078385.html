&gt;Have you tried to remove the jets on the sides of the carb and check for
&gt;crud and spray out with carb cleaner using one with a nozzle.

Not yet.  I did rebuild this carb (including me dunking it in a carb
bucket, and the shop I had rebush the throttle shaft cleaning it) in
spring 2003 and it's had less than five or six tanks of gas through it
since then.  But, I don't know what the condition of my gas tank is.
The fuel filter doesn't have any obvious boulders in it, but the paper
element is dark brown.

&gt;Also why doesn't your carb have the electic cut off solenoid?? Has it
&gt;been replaced with a manual one ?

It came that way from the previous owner.  It does have a jet screwed
into the right side of the carb where I think the cutoff solenoid would
go.
