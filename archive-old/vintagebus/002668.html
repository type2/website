Hey Everyone,
    We made it back in one peice.  First off I wanted to thank all the
people who offered use a place to crash for the night, mechanical help or a
salvage yard suggestion.  The number of  responces was really unexpected.
Unfortunately we never seemed to be near a list member when it came time to
crash for the night.  Well, here's a day by day account, I'll try to keep it
short.
    Day 1---  We (My brother, Jason and I) headed out from Columbus around
12:30 pm Friday. (Note to self:  The night before a long road trip it is not
wise to visit numerous local bars and consume many beers.)  So, with my
Advil and a large bottle of water, down the road we went.  We had hoped to
hit Omaha,NE the first night, but our late start kept that from happening.
Nothing too exciting happened and we ended up staying at Jubilee College
State Park on the other side of Peoria, IL.  Nice place.
    Day 2---  Made it through Iowa and just into South Dakota.  As soom as
we hit the road my &quot;mystery problem&quot; (Me Three Re: Fuel Filter Saga)  It
cleared up after a little while.  This would happen almost every morning for
the rest of the trip.  Stayed at Union County State Park.  Camped next to
some Hippies from Missouri who were on there way to Washington state.  They
had a beat up '73 Westy.  When we pulled in looking for a campsite I spotted
the Westy and it's owner and was like &quot; Hey how's it going man?&quot;  My brother
thought I knew the guy.  He doesn't yet understand the bond we VW owners
have.  We talked for a while then hit the sack.
    Day 3 ---  I let my brother drive through a tank of gas.  Found out my
passenger seat is really uncomfortable.  I only let him drive one more time.
I really need to fix the seat or better yet throw in a pair of Vanagon
seats.  Saw a bunch of Bays and Vanagons through South Dakota.  First stop
was a drive throught the Badlands National Park.  Very Cool, I wish we had
the time to stay there for the night.  Then Wall Drug, which was neat.  Way
to touristy for me.   I picked up a bumper sticker for Sweet Pickle.  Then
we made our way near Mt. Rushmore staying at Battle Creek Campground near
Keystone.  Nice place, $14 for the night, many showers, dish washing station
and level semiprivate camp sites.
    Day 4 ---  We let Sweet Pickle warm up before heading out.  Hopeing it
would help alleiviate the mystery problem.  It did seem to help.  Stopped at
the Rushmore Caves first.  Pretty long cave, not as many stalagtites and
stalagmites as the brochure, but very cool anyhow.  Then to Mt. Rushmore.
It was pretty impressive.  Then we headed to Devils Tower in Wyoming, Close
Encounters all over again. The walk around the base was never ending, but
worth doing.  There were about 4 people climbing to the top.  Too scary for
me.  Then we headed down to Cheyenne, WY where my brother was stationed in
the Air Force.  We stayed with a buddy of his for the next two nights.
    Day 5 ---  Took a little trip down to Fort Collins, CO as soon as we got
off the highway there was a little all VW junkyard on the other side of the
road, and a block down a VW service station with about 15 Bays and Vanagons
awaiting service.  I was in VW Bus heaven.  I wanted to move there and set
up shop.  There were so many around town I couldn't keep count.  I had kind
of an odd feeling though.  For the first time I wasn't &quot;the&quot; VW bus guy in
town.  I was another one of those VW bus guys.  It did feel like I grew up
in the town, waving at so many people in there Buses, like a family
atmosphere.
    Day 6 --- We headed for home, driving through Nebraska this time.
Stayed at Pawnee State Recreation Area near Lincoln.  We must have been in
the flight path of the local airport.  Large passenger jets were flying over
all the time and people kept driving around the campground all night.  We
hit the road early the next morning.
    Day 7 --- Through Iowa again ending up at Moraine View State Park on the
other side of Bloomington, IL  Nice RV camping area and a lot of friendly
people.
    Day 8 --- The final drive home.  Pretty uneventful until after I dropped
my brother off in Columbus.  Sweet Pickle broke down on me in the middle
lane of I71 in the middle of rush hour.  The only real breakdown of the
whole trip.  I got it off to the side of the road.  She just refused to
start.  The coil was really hot, so I through on another one.  Still no go.
Popped off the fuel lines at the carbs and turned it over.  No fuel.
Checked the filters and cracked open the filter on the pump.  All clear, I
tried it again and she fired up and ran fine the whole way back home to
Orrville.  I think I have some crud in my tank, I've ruled out most
everything else.
    It was truly an adventure.  I can't wait to get out on the road again
and see some more of this country we live in.  Thanks again everyone!!!

See you down the road,
