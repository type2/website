Subject: Re: [VB] veewee clock repairs

I know it's hard to tell from this picture, but this guy in town has a '67
that was missing the block-off plate.

He got a piece of metal and flanged it to fit flush from behind and fill in
the radio hole. It looks REAL good and is an easy solution for someone
doing what you want...or someone with a '67 who wants a block-off. Real
cool to put guages in...I think.

p.s. You shoud've pulled the block-off plate from my bus when it was yours
(and when it was Red, White, &amp; Blue) to keep in your stash!

p.s.s How's the single cab coming? still got those extra lower nose pieces?
did you get the replacement nose welded in?

p.s.s.s. No, I havn't checked with the owner of the bus stash yet. I know,
I'm &quot;lame&quot;.
