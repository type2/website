&lt;&lt; all I have is a handwritten bill of sale. This was sufficient in GA, but SC
 requires a title to get a vehicle registered.  How do I go about getting a 
title for my bus? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Drive or call first to a nearby State and see if you can get it titled there. 
 There are also titleing businesses in many states (Especially Arkansas) that 
can do this for a price via the mail.
