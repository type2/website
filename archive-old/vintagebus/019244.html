Subject: Mexico-Bush/Fox and expanded NAFTA
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Forget macking on the Japanese. At least they are on
the whole a culture with money and a sembelance of
manners. 

I personally have *extemely* strong non-vw related
feelings about the recent media spin meister fodder
regarding opening the borders between the US and
Mexico, the enlightenment that the State of Arizona
(Thursday 02/15/01) narrowly approved a measure to
grant AZ State driver's licenses to illegal, oops,
&quot;undocumented&quot; residents and the general desire of
Vicente (the genius) Fox for the USA to grant amnesty
to all undocumented aliens currently living in the
USA.

My opinion is that Ross Perot had it all backwards. We
should expect a sucking sound coming North. Why aren't
the &quot;conservative&quot; patriots going ape *hit over this
subject?

Aside from that rant which could take me hours to
complete, perhaps there is an potential up side

What will all of this BS near sighted
rapid/rabid/neener-neener Republican agenda do to ease
importation of funky frankenstein buses and new issue
&quot;old generation&quot; Beetles up from Messico? Hopefully
the State of Arizona will instruct the non-taxpaying
moe-foes to drive in the right hand lane if they
insist on doing 35 on the freeways...
