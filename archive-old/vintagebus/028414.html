Hey all,

Too clarify the flywheel teeth were ingreat shape, and so were the 
starter's.  Both 12v w/ prober starter bushing.  Flywheel was torqued to 
spec.

Thanks,

eric


&gt;&gt;FW and starter have matching style teeth (both either 12V or 6V) right?
&gt;
&gt;starter has new appropriate bushing
&gt;
