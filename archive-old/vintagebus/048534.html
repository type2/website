&gt;DMV will give you the name of the last few registered owners, we'll
&gt;call them A B and C .  Your task will be to get bills of sale from
&gt;A to B, B to C.   You'll also have to get one from C to D; D is
&gt;the guy you bought it from but DMV doesn't know him from Adam
&gt;'cause he never registered the damn thing.  You're E in this example,
&gt;and you should already have a Bill o' sale from D to E.


I've heard coastal people talk about us Kansas folk as being a bit slow (we
don't have to worry so much about getting run off the road) and maybe
backward, but I can get a title on any vehicle, no matter if it has a
current title or not, with one trip to the DMV!

If the vehicle is over 35 years, you get an antique title and for that you
just need the VIN number.

If newer than 35 years, use 3 bills of sale (you can even write them to
yourself!) on 3 seporate pieces of paper, take the vehicle to the patrol
office where they check the VIN to see if it was stolen, then go to the DMV
where they issue you a new title!!

We may not have beaches, moutains, or large cultural centers, but by golly,
we can get your vehicle titled in no time!!
