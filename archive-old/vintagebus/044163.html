Howdy All!
My 66 bus would not start yesterday, it just cranked and cranked.  Upon looking under my distributor cap I discover that the little wire connected to the points inside the distributor is completely fried and melted (I think this may have been damaged a couple of weeks ago when I had my coil shorting out against the carb, when it fried some wires and I didn't look under the distributor cap, so I didn't see this wire damage)  Any way, I am assuming I need to replace the points, condenser, and what the hell, even the rotor and cap.  My question is this :  I do I remove the old points and install the new ones?  Any instructions and advice would be greatly appreciated!
