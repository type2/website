Subject: Re: [VB] temp. question

Actually, with RPMS too low or too high, the engine runs hotter.   as rpms go 
up, cooling air blown increases, and so does heat produced, but not at the 
same rate as each other.  work goes up with the square of the speed.  It all 
boils down to that 2600 to 2800 rpms is the coolest speed, according to the 
several buses I have checked this in, from 1600 sp  with early 64 gearing to fat 
2000cc motor in no rgbox bus.    below 2600 the engine runs hotter  the slower 
it goes.  above 2800rpms, the engine runs hotter the faster it goes. 
I don't tend to drive 2700 rpms, though.

Check this out for yourself, drive along at 40, then 45, then 50 till the 
numbers level off (will take a few minutes), then 55, then 60, then 65. etc  
write it all down.   If you have a tach, even better.   I'd love to get info from 
a range of people.   It would be interesting to try to compare temps w/ diff 
gearing too, but you have to take into account outside temps, humidity, etc, so 
that could be tricky.

no, I dont run  a berg dipstick, I have oil temp guages.

 I get flamed everytime I say it, but putting in gearing that is too tall
 makes a bus run too hot (4000 rpm _at_ 70mph is the limit for full
 dependability IMHO). Slow your engine down, you slow the cooling fan down.
 .....................
 Just for an example:
 I'm running a 3.88 r&amp;p, 1.26 redux boxes, with a .89 4th with 25.3&quot; diameter
 tires. This sticks me at 69mph _at_ 4000 rpm.
 If your trans has a stock 4.12 r&amp;p with a .89 4th, and were running the same
 tires as me, your cooling fan is spinning almost 20% slower than mine while
 we drive the same speed without reduction boxes. That's a big drop in
 cooling if you ask me. I hope you're not running a stock size tire. If you
 are, it might be worth a shot to try a shorter tire to get the rpm's back
 up. Do you know anyone that can lend you some tires to try out?
 
 I ran a 'freeway flier' with a 3.88 r&amp;p and .82 4th years ago in my old
 Westy. I was limited to doing 60mph or else I would run hot. I went through
 everything I could, like jetting, timing, etc, etc. I got fed up, and
 installed a stock gear box. My rpm's were higher, but I was able to drive
 65mph without overheating anymore. Imagine that, I was able to drive faster
 without a freeway flier. Ironic, isn't it?
 
 But then again, i'm one of those guys that believes my bus should run as
 cool as a bug. And it does. I floor my engine for hours at a time. If my bus
 isn't doing 65, then the pedal is to the floor. Fully loaded or not. My berg
 dipstick doesn't even light up. After a long drive up a canyon, or through
 some headwinds, the contact is still about an 1/8&quot; away from touching,
 normal driving, it is about a quarter turn away from touching. How many
 people here run a Berg dipstick? Probably not many, as it seems a lot of
 people accept that &quot;It's a bus, it runs hotter&quot;, and &quot;The Berg dipstick is
 just a worry light anyway&quot;.  The light comes on for a reason guys.  ;-)
 
 I do hear of people running fully loaded buses with freeway flier trannies
 in them, and they say it doesn't run hot at all. I ask them what the head
 and oil temps are, and they don't know. They can just 'tell' if it is.
 
 Flame away....... &gt;&gt;
