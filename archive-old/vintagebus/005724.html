Hey,

Cycle Garden in Huntington Beach, CA had one of those
gizmos. Looked great with a bus on it. Don,t know if maybe
he rents or loans it out.

Chris

&gt; OK, dollies are great, but there's a guy calling himself
Karmann Jack up
&gt; here in these parts, and he has invented something I would
expect to see on
&gt; the Red Green show (well, maybe if it had more duct tape).
It's a
&gt; ROTISSERIE for cars!!
&gt;
&gt; There is a stand at each end of the Beetle or KG body, and
a bracket which
&gt; bolts to the bumper mounts.  The bracket mounts to the
stand on a crude
&gt; bearing, and the bracket is offset so that things are
balanced, and you can
&gt; rotate the whole body on a lengthwise axis.  There is a
t-handle set screw,
&gt; like on bench-mount engine stand, to hold the car in
position.  This way
&gt; you can sandblast the bottom of you car while standing up,
with plenty of
&gt; light.  The guy actually brought a whole stripped KG body,
less floorpan,
&gt; to the West Side VW meet in Minneapolis a couple of years
back, and set the
&gt; whole thing up.  I think he was taking orders for the
contraption.  No word
&gt; on weather customers had to sign a libility release...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Seems like you could easily make a HEAVY DUTY version for
buses...
&gt;
&gt; Kabayo
&gt;
&gt; P.S. Don't forget to drain all fluids and empty the
ashtrays before
&gt; rotating your car...
&gt;
