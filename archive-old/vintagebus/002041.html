Well, on my '63 Micro the lighter was (not a typo), was right in front of
the ashtray. While working on the front I welded a piece there since I did
not like the way it was installed, sticking upwards like that. I probably
lost some big bucks because while extracting lighter from the dash I managed
to brake it. Had to throw it away. The only part left is the lighter itself.

Anybody needs it?

Later,
