It probably isn't the new bearing that's at fault. If you needed to
replace one bearing, then the rest of them are probably worn out too.
The play you feel is probably in the lower inner bearing. I recommend
that you take the whole RGB apart and replace all the bearings. It's
really kind of pointless to replace just one bearing in a RGB. Any chips
that are in the oil from the other worn out bearings will quickly ruin
your new bearing.

I've used Bower brand bearings before and didn't find them to be any
different from any other brand. Different companies will have different
part numbering systems. Some companies will just use the same system as
one of the big guys like FAG or SKF. The difference in part numbers
probably doesn't mean anything. They both have 207 in them, so they're
probably the same size.

When you take the Bower bearing back out, compare it to the used bearing
you're putting back in. If it has the same ID, OD, and width, then you
can be sure you need to completely rebuild the RGB.

Hope that helps,
