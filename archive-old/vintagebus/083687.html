Subject: Re: [VB] Speaking of Oil...

As stated before I run 20/50 as well. I think and I vaugely remember seeing VW based their recomendations on climate as well. I'd never run 30 in my bus because of where I live, It just seems too thin. I have about 50k on my motor (1600 SP, full flow, hp1, Berg pump cover, doghouse) and only use the 20/50. as a matter of fact that's all i ever use and I've never had a problem with overheating or excessive pressure (that I know of I don't use gauges, but Ive not blown a seal either)

&gt;&gt;At what temperature? &lt;&lt;
Hi Everett,
Somewhere just above 210F from what we understand. The real problem is the 
oil that goes to the heads gets much hotter and breaks down due to this even 
if you keep your oil temp below 210F!
When we used to run our engine without gauges we got a black coating 
inside the head rocker arm area. Since we now keep our oil temps below 220 F, the 
heads in that area stay nice and shiny. In other words the black coating is 
the oil being thermally broken down. This is similar to cast iron black 
coating where one heats the cast iron hot enough to burn the grease (Bacon is 
best for this) into a coating.

&gt;&gt;I've used 20/50 during the AZ summer and have had no problems. On older 
engines where the engine light would come on at idle after a highway cruise 
with straight 30wt, the 20/50 would leave the oil light off, which indicates to 
me a higher oil pressure at idle. I have seen oil temperatures as high as 
230F with no trouble.&lt;&lt;

Trouble, will be in reduce engine life span, due to less lubrication. It is 
possible that most of this problem would be circumvented by changing the 
multi weight oil every 1,500 miles, but we just prefer to avoid all that and 
just run single weight in the warmer seasons.

&gt;&gt; What was the pressure? I've started up my 36hp Bus at 30-35F with 20/50 
many times with no problems. A lighter 10/30 would be better at colder 
temperatures... &lt;&lt;

We do not remember the pressure, but it was more than the 30 WT we used. So 
thusly our comment that it acted more like 40 WT when cold. We also had no 
problems with our oil/filter pump and 30 Wt. oil in colder wether. Till we 
blew out two oil filters without internal relief valves! That is another 
thing one learns just to avoid if possible.
