from what I can tell from P.I.P.'s webpage, they've totally sold out and are
only making noo beetle racks.  Maybe they're making old beetle racks too, but
that doesnt help me either.  We have A bus and 2 T3's and they stopped making
racks for both types so screw them.  I'm sure there's others out there making
nice westy style racks.

Good luck finding them, I bet Uncle Jerry knows
