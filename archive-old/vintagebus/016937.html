Assuming you're within the load limit (probably should de-rate by 20%
or so, to allow for age, unless you've actually rebuilt the suspension
recently), I wouldn't worry about it for short periods of time.  If
you were talking about weeks, I'd be worried.  It being a '62, I'm
pretty sure that means it was a 3/4-ton load.  Knocking off 20% for
age, that comes out to 1200 pounds.

Of course, that 20% is just a Kentucky-windage figure.  The real
question is &quot;how close to bottoming out are you?&quot;.  You'll want at
least a couple of inches of suspension travel available when you go to
the dump, more if you'll be on rough roads or going quickly.
Bottoming out's not a good thing for the suspension or the frame....
