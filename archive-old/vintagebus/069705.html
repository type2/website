Subject: rear truck bumper Q

Hi All,

 

I know earlier busses and trucks have different rear bumpers but I was
recently asked whether or not the mid 60's line up had different bumpers
and I couldn't answer the question with certainty. so I post it up to
the masses for judgement.

 

 

Thoughts?

 

 

 

David
