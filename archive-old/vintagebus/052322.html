Thought about that method.  For 4 years before I entered the Air Force =
in 82 I was a trained Auto Body repairman.  I've aligned doors that way =
plenty of times, and using a floor jack.  Was just hoping someone had a =
secret that was less chancing of damaging the door.

     Due to the limited amount of room and the way the hinges face, =
shimming VW doors really is not practical.  Your gonna have to tweak the =
hinges.  Normally this should have been done before starting any panel =
replacement, but there is the acception every now and then.  You need a =
piece of 2 X 4 about 2 1/2 feet long plus another board to pry off of in =
the cargo area.  I say this, because it the rocker is rusty or missing =
you need support to pry off of.  Set the 2 X 4 on the other board and =
shut the door as far as possible.  With your pry board under the cargo =
doors left side you can pry up.  Do this a little at a time, checking =
out the doors fit as you go along. =20
     Body Shops use this technique, usually charging the customer an =
hours labor.  With practice you can align most doors and hoods in about =
10 minutes.  Also the heavier the door or hoods the longer the 2 X 4, =
but for VW stuff the 2 1/2 feet board seems to work rather well and is =
less prone to over powering the door.  You want to move things nice and =
slow.=20
