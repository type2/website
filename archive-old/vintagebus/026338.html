Yes. The cheap ones are usually stock cranks that have the
counterweights welded on. A dubious design at best. Look for a one piece
forged crank or a crank machined from a solid chunk of steel. Scat,
bernie bergman, cb performance, gene berg are all excellent quality.

I would rather have a stock non-counterweighted crank than a cheap
welded-up one...
