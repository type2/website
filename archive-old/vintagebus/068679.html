&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; There is a lot of work to be done there but if it's as
&gt; complete as it looks......in fact even if it isn't
&gt; $500 is a complete steal

Well, I don't know if I'd say &quot;complete steal&quot;.  That's a lot of holes
for 500 bucks!  Depends where you are located though.  Do you weld? 
Have a welder? Have the money for parts? Have time?  Where is the camper
interior??  

He had to be high on crack to want 1500 originally.  I'd still offer him
less...he's desperate, right?

Steve
