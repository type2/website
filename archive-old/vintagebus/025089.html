Yep, funny, i drained the first plug in the tranny and very little oil seemed to
come out.  Then I took out the second plug in the tranny and black thick stuff
came out.  When I examined the oil afterwards there was a lot of stuff in there.
Even some shinny steel.  It really didnt seem like anywhere near 2.5 litres of oil
came out.

When i did the reduction boxes there really didn't seem to be any pinhead size
particles.  Well not pinhead size in 3 dimensions anyway.  Most of the particles
looked like flakes.  Like corn flakes only black and tiny and maybe were flakes of
the casing.  Also it seem like lots of oil came out of them much more than.25
litres.

I am a little worried that I  may have put too much oil in the transmission and
reduction boxes.  I read that together they should take 3 litres total.  I may
have 3.5 litres but I can't be sure.


&gt; Mark down that you should change the tranny/reduction oil at least once
&gt; somewhere about 1,000 miles or if you really like your bus change it twice one
&gt; at 500 miles and again at 1,000 miles.  This will help get almost all of the
&gt; crud out.

Ya, I'll do it.  I did consider this when i saw how much stuff came out of the
tranny.  So I am sure that there is a tool of some sort for filling
transmissions.  Could you tell me what it is.  I'm currently using a 3/8&quot;  ID
plastic tube and a funnel attached to my SO.  The 3/8 tube is a little slow, but
the funnel works fine.  The problem is the SO insists on complaining the whole
time :).

 &quot;The clutch cable runs through a steel tube welded to the bus body with no
housing of the cable's own.  Suggest applying oil to the clutch and brake pedals
piviot area and see if that helps.&quot;

When i said &quot;housing&quot; i really should of said &quot;steel tube.&quot;  I'll try the oil.  I
Also think that the steel tubes my heater cables ride in are full o' crap,
probably sand.  The cables either jamb inside the tube, or maybe the springs in
the boxes are no longer strong enough to close completely?  Im not sure.

Anyway.  Thanks again
