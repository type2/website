&lt;&lt; To all,
 I have an old trailer hitch, the kind that attaches to the torsion bar tubes 
 with u bolts, and to the rear bumper for tongue weight.
 I looked in the archives for wisdom on the best way to make the rear bumper 
 end of this strong enough for tongue weights, and found no consensus.
 Have folks done thi &gt;&gt;

I used a tow hitch like this to tow buses short (not more than 60 miles) 
distances (and a bug 500 miles from Idaho once)   But that has virtually no 
weight on the tongue.  So I guess I can't help.
