I guess I have been lucky, I took a deposit for the 62panel and gave them 3
weeks to pay it off or it goes back on the market, the deposit paid was
clearly defined as non-refundable. I also sent a deposit to the gentelmen I
bought the 59 single cab from and he assured me that not to worry as he's
had it for years and will not sell it to another buyer. The same goes with
my other recent purchase I  sent a good will deposit as I bought this bus
site unseen and the owner honored his original selling price even though he
was informed it was worth 2 to 3 times the selling price by others who tried
to purchase it, my point, there are still good and honest people out there
who honor their word, but we will see what happens as I need to make 2 major
road trips to pick these beasties up.

Pretty common, unfortunately.  Another buyer appears and the seller
casually mentions that he already has an offer for $xxx.  The buyer
naturally offers $50 more and has cash in hand.

From the seller's point of view, cash in hand is better than a promise
over the phone.  Having been stood up by more people than I care to think
of, I can understand the seller's point of view.  

When I make a deal of
this sort, I tell the phone buyer that &quot;first cash buys&quot;, which means that
I am still free to sell to that Japanese gentleman that walks in off of
the street.  This also motivates the phone buyer to get the cash to me
toot-sweet if he is truly interested.  I don't fiddle around with deposits
either.  The simpler and quicker the transactions, the happier both
parties will be.

If I'm the buyer, It behooves me to get the cash to the seller ASAP.  This
eliminates some long-distance deals, but it also eliminates 
disappointment.  This hobby is supposed to be fun, not stressful.
