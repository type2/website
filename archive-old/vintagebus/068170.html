Subject: Re: [VB] How much pressure to grease king pin zerks?

&gt; It is super-easy to grease the link pin zerks. But I cannot get enough
&gt; pressure on the gun to grease the king pin zerks

Try jacking the bus up and put it on jack stands to relieve the pressure on
the kingpins. We have the same problems at work and this seems to do the
trick.
