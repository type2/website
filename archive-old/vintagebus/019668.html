There's a longstanding tradition that when crossing the border into Cali,
the extra passengers are hidden under the bed, or cling to the frame, or
false-bottomed vans.  In a pickup, you could probably squeeze one normal-sized
guy or 2 kids under the bed.  Modify a deluxe with lowered belly pans and no
heater tube, and you could get 3 under the floor!

&gt; sounds like a plan, but be forwarned that once you cross the boarder into CA, that
&gt; any passengers riding in a truck bed must be sitting in a anchored seat and
&gt; secured with a seat belt.  One of the laws that went into effect about 5 years
