It a snap.  4 years ago I bought my first bus.  Two
weeks later I bought a complete harness from Wolfsburg
West.  I had 0 (zero) electrical/wiring experience and
managed to take my time and complete it in 1 easy day.

Also, print up one of Thom's wiring diagrams.  They
can be intimidating, but if you follow the diagram
while pulling the old harness, it will make better
sense putting the new one in.

In short, this was one of the easiest jobs I have
attempted on my bus in the past 4 years.

Enjoy your day!
