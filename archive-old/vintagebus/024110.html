&gt; I had my steering wheel recently redone by Koch's.
&gt; 
&gt; I sent in my old wheel, which BTW had absolutely no cracks in it, and when they received it they called me right away and quoted me the price of $125.00.  I said o.k. and in about 3 weeks the wheel arrived.

I like Bob Koch. This past year at Seattle I watched him haggle with a
good acquaintance of mine over some decent early bug pop-outs. Here is a
guy who does Lots of business in VW all over the country, and he still
wanted to talk and BS and get a good deal, but a fair deal, on some
small gravy parts. I am pre-disposed to dislike him because of that
monstrosity of a splitty limo he parades about, but I have dealt with
his company a couple times and had really good luck, and have always
liked him personally whenever I see him at a vw event. I have not had
similar experiences with the owners of some of the other large vw parts
distributors/manufacturers.
