&gt; grab an old speedo cable..cut off the end, stick one end in the speedo and
&gt; one end in  a drill...find a nice television show, sit back and press the
&gt; button and enjoy.

That would take more than a television show.... more like a week or
two...
a tire with a 25&quot; diameter has about a 78 inch circumference, which is
about 6.5 feet, which is a fair bit more than 1/800th of a mile....so
you gotta spin it roughly 800 times to click over a mile.

Now what speed does your average Makita drill run?  3500 rpm is a
guess... so very roughly 4 miles per minute...( 3500/800/mile/min) so
spose you gotta click the thing 30,000miles (or maybe more??? where is
your speedo now?) to get back to zero you are gonna wait about 5 days (4
miles/min x 60 mins x 24hrs = 5,760 miles per day) at 3500 rpm drill
speed. So hey, get a really fast drill...( i'm no drill expert) and spin
that baby at 35,000 rpm and you are still gonna need Starwars trilogy,
Godfather series, and several episodes of Andy Griffith to zero that
baby.

There is a VDO repair shop in Portland, Oregon on hoyt street who will
fix and re-set speedos for about $50 a shot... I can get a beter address
if needed, but they are called Speedometer Services and are a VDO
specialist.
