Subject: A question about a bus
Date: Sat, 24 Jun 2000 20:49:10 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

A fun thing to do is to go check out a bus.  That is what Michele and I did
today.  I had noticed a '64 with fresh engine, seats, and tires in the paper
for $2250/b.o.

So I calls the guy, and it turns out to be a Kombi walkthrough with gold
paint on the lower half, six pop-out windows, a very recently and carefully
rebuilt engine and mean-looking snow tires.

I didn't know that combination existed....

The motor sounded and felt really good, but it shifted loosely, and the
steering box is cracked and way sloppy.  There is one windshield wiper that
goes really fast (he didn't change the motor when he went 12v), a cargo
floor that needs replacement, and the worst part is that someone cut out the
air intake louvers and put fiberglass scoops on both sides!  Yuck to the
hacker, although this would be a prime bus to put guages on and run with the
scoops, without the scoops, and with inverted scoops (since they're
alreadycut out).  All window, door seals except for the windshield seals
need replacement, and the rust under them of course needs fixin'.

So, if you've read this far, what do you think?  I am still hoping to get
another certain bus...a deluxe walkthrough that may or may not become
available....if I get this one, it might be really tough to convince Michele
that we need three buses......
