Subject: RE: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

With all the talk I have heard on these cases I suspect that a returned case
would be turned around and sold again. That's the reason I opted to repair my
case. That and the fact that it takes the attorney general to make things
right. No, I'll keep my attorneys fees and transfer part of them to the
block!

I would be very interested in aircooled_dot_net's list of known defects of
the new aluminum type 1 cases. There seems to be considerable confusion
regarding this, and the frequency in which they appear.

I consider myself pretty tenacious but I think I'd just have tried to get
my money back.
After you've done all of the Research and Development for the case
manufacturer you're still stuck with a May-Pop Engine because you might
still have missed something.
You may have saved them many thousands of dollars with your efforts to
use their product but you'll never get a thank you or a check and
absolutely not a case that is properly cleaned and machined.
I just could never have any faith in any part that gave this much grief.
I must admit you photography is very good and the problems are clerarly
defined.
