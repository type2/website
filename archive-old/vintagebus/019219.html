Subject: re: walkthru dblcab
To: dgilling_at_coronado-realty_dot_com, vblist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

was writ:
I think I have seen some pictures of the crew cab
someplace else. 
What was a suprise to me is that it appears to be a
walkthru!  Was 
there a walkthru crew cab produced?
.........
have another look at the rear seating picture, and you
will notice the spare tire hump protruding. those
front
seats look like bug seats to me. a fine conversion,
and
 not a hack i'm sure. ;)?
