Subject: Preliminary Mexican Engine Results

I've installed the all new engine and went through some break in
procedures.
I have run the engine for close to an hour, but I haven't driven with it
yet (will tonight).

These are my preliminary findings.

- working on a clean engine is nice.  I've never done it before.
- thermostat mount wasn't machined...I drilled and tapped it.  I called
the company I purchased the
    engine from and they checked their warehouse: about half had it
machined and half didn't; they'd
    never noticed before - those guys down south never run thermostats I
guess
- only mod I put on the engine so far is a type4 cooler (plus gauges of
course).  I will add other items (like filter)
   once I verify it runs good undressed

- I let it turn over a while to get the carb filled.  She started right
away and idled so sweet without even tuning the
    carb (34pic3)
- engine was soooo smooooth
- puffed a lot of smoke at first, but by the end of the break in
procedure (about 20min) the smoke was gone.
- I expected the engine to run hot at this point but it didn't.  I'm not
sure hot to read that.  It was cool outside.

- I changed the oil after 30 minutes and it looked a lot like metalic
paint, with microscopic metal flakes in it.  I didn't find anything in
the filter
   screen.  I presume this is normal for a fresh engine.  I'm going to
drive it again tonight and check/change the oil again.

I'll know much more after I drive it tonight.  So far so good.

Tardis seems happy.

...Markus (and Tardis)
