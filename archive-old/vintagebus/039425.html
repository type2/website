&gt;&gt; &gt;I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty 
&gt;&gt;with.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The semantics of 'best' are beyond anything.&quot; -- Muir

Porsche 911 6 cylinder air cooled 3 liter turbo.

Of course.


And then when the dream is over, go with a nice single port 1641.

Actually, all kidding aside, if you can aford a porsche 911 6, this engine 
will give you what a bus could really use. Its almost too bad that this air 
cooled option isnt more readily available.
1. Its part of the same lineage (more or less)
2. It has the torque you really could use
3. Its air cooled
4. Its proven that a well built engine like this can last and last
