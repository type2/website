Hey Rick

Been reading your post about your gas heater seminar,
so .....

I am looking to add a gas heater to my 67 Camper and
would like to pick your brain on what I should be
looking for. I do have duel batteries in the engine
compartment so I will probably have to mount somewhere
inside the Bus such as under the rear seat. Since I
travel with my family I am looking for Safety First,
heat second.
I've looked at many used BN4 but they always seem OLD
and used up. 
What can you recommend??

Thanks in advance
Chuck Notmeyer
