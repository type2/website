First off, you need a way to get the water out of them.  My personal
method is to drill small holes in the corners of each compartment.
Some people don't like this, the reply being &quot;But now you're got water on
your floor!&quot;  Like you didn't already?  I think I'm going to do the tiny
hole trick in the floors, too, to give the water a complete path to the
ground.

On to POR-15; yes, you can paint over it, but you need to lay down a 
light coat of primer when the POR-15 is still tacky, to give the
top coat something to stick to.

&gt; After the rains here in phx I noticed that I have a little rust forming in my 
&gt; parcel tray.  Damn safaris!!  Anyway, I was planning on blasting the tray and 
&gt; painting it back to L87.  I want to POR15 it if I can but need to know two 
&gt; things:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Which Product to use
&gt; 2.  Can POR15 be painted over and will the paint quality be ok?
