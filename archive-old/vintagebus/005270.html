Dan who runs Competition Engineering in AZ has one too.. supposed to be in
good shape. I was in there when a guy was beggin him to sell it one
time...its not officially for sale....price was high high but he sounded
like he'd part with it at the right $.
...everyone has their price.
good luck everett. I know he loves notches, time for a trade...... im sure
hed take your barndoor and your notch for it...how much do you REALLY want
one? :)
