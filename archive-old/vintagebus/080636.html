Subject: Re: [VB] Bill Colville

&gt; I just returned to Albuquerque from a couple nights
&gt; with the Colville family in Las Cruces, Bill and Janet
&gt; and their daughters Becca and Ely.
&gt; 
&gt; Bill and Janet have been wonderful camping partners,
&gt; and I'll miss him greatly.  Thanks for reading,
&gt; 
&gt; JP

A bunch of us including JP camped next to Bill _at_ the last Jerome Jamboree.
He had a wonderful set up in Melvan, the stickered camper, complete w/ pink
flamingos &amp; a hitchhiker that Bill picked up on the way &amp; offered to share
his hospitality to.  After hanging w/ all of us for a while, Bill went
around &amp; quickly collected $25-30 to give to the H. hiker to buy raffle
tickets with.  That is the way Bill &amp; Janet are- always interested in
helping others, living the VW bus life, &amp; passionate in environmental/
artistic &amp; political causes.

Although I have spent time at other campouts w/ Bill, I will most treasure
the 3 days we hung out right before this last period of his life began. He
is truly 1 of the most interesting volks I have ever met, &amp; the VW bus scene
will be missing 1 of it's greatest champions.

Pax to Bill &amp; Janet &amp; their daughters.
