Subject: Re:   

This virus is not being sent through the Vintage bus list server, but
rather, people that get the Re: email with outlook express, it automatically
asks you if you would like to view the attachement (I've never seen one
automatically ask this without you clicking on the attachment, but they
figured out a way).  If you click yes to view this, you have the virus, so
always, always say no, and virus scan the email attachments before reading
them (I do this to friends also).  Once you have a virus, it goes through
your outlook and emails itself to people you have in your outlook (hence the
vintage bus list).

I have received this file 6 times so far from:
Grace Casperson gcas_at_terragon_dot_com
K.JEVEC jevec_at_tcsn_dot_net
john &amp; teresa circlep_at_flash_dot_net
Sherry Cavaness scavaness_at_earthlink_dot_net
POINTSHAVER pointshaver_at_mindspring_dot_com
Keith Turner Vwrelics1_at_btopenworld_dot_com

If you see your name here, you have the virus, and keep sending it out to
people.

If not, now you know not to open any attachments.

Thank you
Charles
