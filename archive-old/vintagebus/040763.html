if it is the same filter as a toyota (it looks like it, and most likley
is) or, a toyota filter will fit on it, it will have the bypass valve.

&gt;Ehh, it seems like such a compromise when there's better and not
necessarily more expensive ways to filter.  Don't let the name fool ya, the
REAL factory puts on a filter/pump these days.
