Hey all,

I know some people have been posting trany/shifting probs so I hope this 
isn't redundant!  I've had Sprout (66 dlx hardtop) for over 4 months now and 
have probably changed the stay lube 3 times.  I have a torn axle boot but 
haven't noticed any leakage...so the explanation below could be due to lack 
of lube that has mysteriously vanished.

The bus's H pattern has always been sloppy and sketchy since I owned it.  
Not wanting to go into 1st until pretty much stopped, not going down to or 
up to any gear until it's in the range.  On flat road sometimes I can't 
shift into 4th until 40mph.  Anyway haven't been to worried util 
recently...the above problems would improve as the bus/trany warmed up, that 
is no longer the case.  Today I had to start at 4th and down shift through 
all the gears at a dead top to get into 1st to take off.  This can be a 
difficult task at stop signs and quick lights.  If I'm real patient mayby 
repeating the shifting exercise it will go into 1st with resistance, if I go 
with traffic, not being patient it'll most likely grid which I hate!

I'm thinking rear engine mount and or tranny mounts.  I haven't done 
anything to the linkage but I now the coupler is tight and doesn't move and 
all the shift rods and things have clearance.  Just wanting some advice to 
the easiest/cheapest steps to try to solve this.  Should I start with 
linkage or mounts?  I'm pretty sure I need tranny mounts!

Sorry for the Saturday morning ramble
Thanks in advance for a strategic battle plan
