Subject: where do I plug it?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Okay, please dont kill me if I sound dumb (be kind
Clara).

My bus (67 deluxe sunroof DARTHVW etc. etc.) has no
place for a cigarette lighter.

The dash has (from left to right) wiper knob, steering
pod, headlight knob, emergency light knob.
There's an ashtray sittin' up by the windshield, but
no cigarette lighter in the dash.

The reason I ask is: 
I figure I should buy one, since there's about 12 in
every single booth at every show I go to. Are they
repro-ing these things like Nikes in a Malaysian
sweatshop or what?

and

I should have a place to plug in my cel phone charger
(seein' as I live in Southern California and all).

And this is my third post today so I think I'm banned
until Saturday.

67 Deluxe sunroof DARTHVW not road-ready engine leaks
like a siv even when it's parked but I'm concerned
about getting a lighter in my dash --duh.
