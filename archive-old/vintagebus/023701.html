Subject: Keyser Pond Camping... (kinda long)

Just woke up after a sorely needed nap since returning from the LiMBO
camping trip here in Central NH...

	My apologies to any who get this on the multiple lists, but we had
Listees attending from all three...

	Guest List in order of my remembering:

	John &amp; Wendy Silva in Sea-scape ('85 Westy GL)

	Scot &amp; Jane Castle ('65 hardtop Westy, but came in the '91 Golf)

	Jon, Marianne, Vicki &amp; Murphy (the beagle) Hathaway
 	('74 Westy side tent) my '73 Westy is sidelined till I find a pair of
matching heads either 1.8L or 2.0L

	Scott &amp; Sue Deschenes(sp?) and crew ('74- Westy... sorry I didn't get
to visit more...)

	Tom Goode ('67 Westy pop-top)

	Ron and Lajiri Van Ness and Christine and Auntie ('71 Westy pop-top)

	Lloyd Perkins and crew ('85 CrewCab)

	Gene and Dawn/Donna Byers (sp?) ('73 Westy pop-top &quot;one owner with
optional Vinyl interior)

	Bill ? ('74 Westy pop-top)

	Adam &amp; Nicole Miller ('74/'76 Adventurewagen)

	Jim and daughter from the Poconos ('74- Westy pop-top)

	George Taylor ('70 Beetle w/ single wheel trailer)

	A couple from Ontario Canada (in a Split window bus, sorry I didn't
meet ya'll)

	Jim &amp; Deb? Phillips ('55 Westy at the Fairgrounds, but hung w/us till
Late &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)

	Jim &amp; Barb Digennaro and crew ('83 Westy GTI) stopped by for dinner)

	Jim? and friends (saw these folks for just a minute Sunday morning
before the show)

	The Whites from NY (wannabussers in a AstroVan w/pop-up camper)

	
	Rained like crazy Thursday night (glad I stayed home)

	Rained like crazy Friday morning...

	I arrived at the campground around noon on Friday, set-up and awaited
arrival of my Wife and Daughter...

	Hot and Humid!

	Left my wife and daughter and niece at the campgounds late that night
(had to work for a bit Staurday morning)

	Arrived back around noon Saturday (it's raining again...)

	Had a good time talking with all the folks and trying to stay dry...
finally canceled the mini-golf tourney around 3:30 due to rain...
Wendy Silva was SOOOO disappointed... &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

	Rain finally tapered off around 4pm, so we started getting things
rolling for potluck supper in the middle of the small loop where most of
us were parked... That at least was dry... Lots of Food!!

	No-one went away hungry, I hope...

	Lloyd, Scot, and Jim Phillips entertained us around the campfire till
11:30pm (quiet hours strictly enforced this year &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;) and Lots of
V-dub talk till the wee hours (around 2am or so)...

	Sorry Tom... no case chunks....

	Sunday morning I started early (5:55am) as Murphy had to go out (How I
love that dog...)
	folks started moseying around looking for Breakfast and planned for an
8am caravan to NH VW show... Caravan got under way at 9:30 with 5
vehicles...

	After I did a quick turn or two in the swap area, I returned to the
campground to Visit with Ron Van Ness and his wife while we broke camp
finally leaving around 1:30 or so...

	Traffic was fairly light in spite of the Indy Car race in nearby Loudon
NH (NH International Speedway, just recovering from 75th Anniversary of
&quot;Bike Week&quot; in Laconia NH)

	Unloaded the cars, sat down for minute and that was it (slept till 10pm
&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)

	I had a great time in spite of the wet weather and I hope others did
likewise... next year will find us in another local campground with
cleaner facilities and hopefully fewer obnoxious little gangbanger
wannabes...

	Take care...
