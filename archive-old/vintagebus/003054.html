Subject: Any1 need Subhatch Hold-downs??

Anyone need a set of the hold-downs for a Westy Subhatch?  I have a set with
black handles.  One is real nice the other has surface rust and is missing
the small spring inside.  Also have the plates they go into.  I'd like to
trade these for something I need  (ex: Striker plates 65/66, Door Handles,
Cargo Handle).  I'm open for any trades, even can put cash into the trade.

Dave
