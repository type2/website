 As far as swap spaces, as I recall you get 2 passes with each swap space, so 
 that cuts the space down to $25 extra, I am not sure how cheap you want it 
to 
 be ????
 even $15 to get in , I think it was the same last year and I think you can 
 get discounted tickets if you buy them early........
  &gt;&gt;
How cheap do I want it to be?  well, around here it is usually $5 per person 
to go in the show, and $20 for a swap space (buy 2 if you have tons of 
stuff).  AT Vintage Meet it is free to show your VW, cause we want people to 
do that.

Yes, these shows tend to be put on by volunteers.  Aren't clubs great!!!!  
Support you local VW club and put on a show or event this summer.
