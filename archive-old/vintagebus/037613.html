&lt;&lt; I'd hardly call digging a bus out of the weeds, titling in my own name,
 spending thousands of dollars and countless hours of labor fixing it up,
 then selling at a loss two years later a &quot;business&quot; &gt;&gt;

Even though you have sold to the japanese, I wasnt refering to you. I was 
refering to the vw bus scene as a whole. People who drive there buses and 
enjoy them understand where I am coming from.
