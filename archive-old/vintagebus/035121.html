Hi Wilder,
Not as far as we have seen and heard about.  The Eberspacher and especially 
the South Wind engine compartment installed gas heaters block access to this 
area.  The circular indentation was formed both for adding rigidity to this 
panel and act as a gutter to divert/drain water sucked in through the engine 
intake vents.  With such a large circle the chances of any single item 
completely blocking this draining affect was reduced.  To prevent this 
blocking of drainage holes in the battery pan VW installed two thich tar 
paper strips to raise the battery slightly to allow not only water drainage, 
but the escaped battery acid with it.  Eric&amp;Barb
