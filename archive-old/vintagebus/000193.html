Hopefully you're friendly with your neighbors.  That helps a lot

Keep all the busses registered and running or give the appearance that they 
do run.  Try to keep all wheels, doors, headlights, etc., attached to the 
bus.  Move the bus around (push if you have to) from one side of the driveway 
to the other, or nose out to back out to give the appearance that it is being 
moved.  Do your work on it during the day when it won't disturb anyone. 

Basically don't give your neighbors, the cops, or the local government any 
reason to pay any attention to you.
