Subject: Re: [VB] leaky tranny

&gt;
&gt; I would soak the area with simple green, wait an hour or so, then take the
&gt; bus to the car wash.  Idea being that you will be able to see where the
leak
&gt; is coming from.
&gt;
&gt; how much does it leak?   I once had a bus with a tranny I kept topping up,
&gt; but the tranny ended up dying.
Well... I did the simple green thing before I fixed it, so I just now went
out and poked around a little closer to see what was going on.  The area
around the plate looks dry and clean still.  It looks like the leak is
coming from around the side cover on the transmission (the part the axle
flange bolts on to).  Also it is definitely leaking from the seam just ahead
of the front drain plug, I'm guessing this is what is called the nosecone?

The other part of the equation here is that Mr. Lube put GL-5 oil into the
tranny.  They claimed they did it because it's thicker and would leak out
slower.  So maybe now that I have thinner oil in there it's coming out
faster.  I also jacked up the left side of the bus a little when I filled
the tranny so I could get more oil into it.  I haven't been able to get the
plugs out of the reduction boxes at all so I wanted to get as much oil into
the centre section as possible. All this might have accelerated the leaking,
it looks pretty bad right now.
Hopefully it'll make it to Nevada and back.
Diana
