Greetings,

Referencing this picture:

Dave &amp; I were discussing the chances of a bullet-signalled high-roof
being an OG factory item yesterday and didn't really come to a
conclusion. With that in mind, I wanted to pose the following questions
to our esteemed listees:

1) What year was the factory high-roof first available?
2) What is the M-Code for this package?
3) Were many ambulances done in a high-roof package?
4) Were the windows in a high-roof normally positioned against the
belt-line or the roof? (They were welded over on this one.)
5) How hard is it to find ambulance innards? (Besides &quot;Very VERY&quot;.)

Thanks for any info,

~Rich
