I have traveled all over Eastern Nebraska in my bus and have never seen
East Armpit. Are you sure you didn't mean Sewer City Iowa? 8) I can't
imagine anyone needing to get out of town fast here in Omaha except
maybe our Mayor 8o
Seriously now
Can anyone tell me how to remove the bezel/glass off the front of the
fuel gauge in my 65 Westy? I pulled it but I could not see a way to pull
the glass off and get to the internal parts
