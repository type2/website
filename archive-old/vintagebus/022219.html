Subject: Synthetic Oil
Mime-Version: 1.0


I blew up the transmission in the 911, so the '56 has been called back into
service as the daily driver.

Today I repacked the front wheel bearings, adjusted the brakes and changed
the oil.

I'd recently tried Mobil-1 in the 911, but have decided not to continue due
to the number of leaks that sprung up!

Since I have several quarts of mobil-1 laying around, I decided to try it
in the bus!  I know anyone that has actually done it.  At $4.19 a quart, I
can't blame them.

This stuff sucks to pour, too - the mouth is so wide on the bottle that
it's easy to pour it faster than the filler can take it, making a mess!  An
expensive mess at that!

The bus seems to run a little smoother, but other than that I haven't
noticed any major improvement.  We'll see how it goes on tomorrow's commute.
