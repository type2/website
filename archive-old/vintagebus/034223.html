a customer and I had this discussion on door repair and he referred to a VW
service bulletin that recommended welding the rivets on the door hinges to
stop any movement and cracking of the door frame.

Any ideas on how I can best repair a front door hinge?  It's starting to
give way, so the door sags when open.  I can see where the inner section is
starting to crack, but I'm sure that welding that crack is not the answer.
