&gt;There's a red generator light on. You look at the fan belt and see 
&gt;it is ready to fly off, so you remove 5 shims and tighten it. But the 
&gt;G-light keeps glowing. You vow to get her runnin' smooth and get 
&gt;that light to shut off over the weekend.

On my 58 single cab with 74 type 1 dual port and an alternator (not
generator), I drove around for 4 days with the G-light on, thinking, &quot;I'm
gonna fix that tomorrow morning&quot;.  Finally stranded my stupid ass about 15
miles from nowhere and took me 2 hours on my cell-phone to get hold of a
sympathetic friend to come rescue me.

The problem (as I already knew) was a bad connection on the big red wire
that runs from the positive connection on the top of the alternator to the
positive terminal on the battery.  So I built a new cable and now
everything's happy again.  If you're running an alternator, you can test
this theory by (carefully) hooking up a jumper cable from your positive post
to your positive post.  If it's a generator, I don't know.

I hope your problem is this simple!
