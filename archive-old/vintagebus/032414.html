I'm sure this must be directed at ME, since I brought up the possibility 
that our friend Michel may be bilingual.  I'm sure if you re-read my post 
you'll see that I didn't &quot;slam&quot; ANYONE.  If anything, I defended him.

&gt;anywhere!  And a more down to earth and unassuming people you just CANNOT
&gt;find.  They have a certain spirit that is really hard to pin down - John

&gt;Irish/English Canadian so I'm not a francophone - I'm just a bit of a
&gt;Francophile.
&gt;
&gt;I do think it is inappropriate to slam someone because the don't speak
&gt;'merican.
