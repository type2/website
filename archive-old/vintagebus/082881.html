Subject: '59 Single Cab...passenger rocker replacement done

I got my passenger side rocker replaced this week. I just got done 
spot welding the main rocker in place. I still have to clean some 
stuff up a little with the grinder, but all in all it turned out 
really good...especially for an amatuer.

I had to replace all the lower rocker on this whole side...from wheel 
well to wheel well. I used Wolfsburg West pieces for most of it and 
part of another truck for a little. Nothing is perfect, but it is 
more than I thought I'd ever do for this old truck.

I'm slowly getting the &quot;fever&quot; again. Feels good to get some solid 
work done. Here's the link for pictures of what's done so far:
