&gt; actually, they did, sort of... 019, 010  and 050

&gt; not in any kind of bus the late list is driving!
&gt; for the splitty era they were the 'factory' hop-up;
&gt; you could get em from

True. They were sold as screamer kits, the 019's, and
came with a bosch blue coil and a metalic blue 019.
I run a 010 in my bus and I like it. It is better than
a 009 from what I can feel when I drive it. The
problem with the 019 and 010 is that the tune up parts
for them are very expensive. $25+ for just the cap!
They can't be all that bad if that's what the &quot;real&quot;
racers use in their cars. (010)
