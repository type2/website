Hi Hal,
It would help to know what part of the planet you are on.  ;-)  Shipping an 
engine to a differant country is very pricey!  If you are in the USA you 
should give Butch in San Diego a call at (619) 691-8385.  He builds a 1641SP 
with new engine case and CW crank, modifies new heads with exhaust valves 
with thicker stems so they do not snap off as easily.  For about $1,400.00 
without you turning in a core engine.  Less if you have one or more core 
1500/1600 engines to trade in!  Please tell him Eric&amp;Barb said &quot;Hi!&quot;.
