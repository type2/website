&gt; Hi list.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting ready to hook-up the heater on DARTHVW and
&gt; I need a couple of parts/advice.
&gt; 
&gt; I need the &quot;breastplate&quot; engine tin, the one closest
&gt; to the bumper, which the heater hoses pass through.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed on busses at shows, the tin has a raised
&gt; portion which covers half of each heat riser exit, and
&gt; a smaller piece covers the other half.
&gt; The only breastplate tin I could find in the rags and
&gt; some on-line places had cut-outs for heat risers, not
&gt; the raised part with the extra piece.

the technical term for this is &quot;cheap aftermarket cr*p&quot;.  Since most of
the people don't know or care about how their engines cool themselves,
they will buy the junk parts, which are obviously a lot easier to make
than the real VW stuff.  My source for this stuff is the wrecking yards.
I believe that the bug tin is the same as the bus tin for this part.

&gt; Also, I have the rubber flanges and short 3&quot; tubes
&gt; which pass the heater hose through the tin, what
&gt; connects it to the &quot;egg-shaped&quot; pod on the muffler,
&gt; then what connects the bottom exit of that egg-shaped
&gt; pod to the heater box? They don't fit together (about
&gt; 1&quot; or more apart), so I imagine there's a stub or
&gt; something?
There is what amounts to a really wide hose clamp that goes over the exit
tube and the inlet of the heater box.  You could fab this yourself with a
couple of hose clamps and a strip of sheet metal.
