Subject: flicker chasing (long)
References: &lt;199809151750.KAA10768_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

     I have been chasing my generator light flicker for the past several
weeks. I guess I should begin from where I thought it began.  Driving
along the highway, the generator light would flicker but never stay
constantly on.  My first thought was that it may have been the fan belt
slipping.  I replaced the cam shaft pulley with a degree pulley and a
new belt.  I started it up and I though that I was home free.  I took it
for a spin and the flicker chase was still going.  Hmmm, I decided to
pay more attention to Muir and check the brushes and the regulator.  Let
me say that this is a 1966 bus converted to a 12 volt system.  I
purchased a new pair of brushes and looked at my old brushes.  There is
only 1/16 of an inch difference.  I consulted Muir and was going to try
the timing light but I had bad flash backs to 9th grade electronics.  I
received the full 115 volts once and have never been the same since.  I
purchased a new regulator at the local VW store instead.  My battery was
dead as a hammer so I had to jump start the bus. I drove the bus around
the block for a couple of minutes.  The flicker was gone but now I had a
solid light when I took my foot of the gas.  It eventually went away
after a couple of minutes driving.  I started with 11.4 volts before the
drive and ended up with 11.9 volts.  I then checked the voltage coming
out of the regulator and found it to be around 11.9 volts at idle but it
would jump up to around 13 volts when I accelerated the engine ( do not
know the rpms).  I believe that I have fixed my problem but I have a bad
feeling that the &quot;old gray generator ain't what she use to be&quot;.  Does a
dead battery make a difference in the voltage coming out of the
regulator?  Has any one had a similar problem like this?  I am off to
recharge the old battery and try my luck again.
