&gt; Thanks for the reply.  Are 66 and 67 keys different?  My drivers door and 
&gt; engine lid lock are different to the other locks - slightly longer keys and 
&gt; appear to be VW but aren't the cutout VW sign.

Hi Paul,
The 1967 &quot;L&quot; profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter &quot;T&quot; 
tumbler fit.  If you have &quot;L&quot; profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for 
the &quot;T&quot; ones you need.  Since the &quot;L&quot; profile parts are one year only you 
will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front door 
soon to get those parts!
