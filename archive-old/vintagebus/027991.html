Hi,

Those windows I believe are the same as on my 64 dd.  I have 5 of them
as well as part of a new one I found in an oolldd RV store. They are
made my Hehr. The company is still in existence here in the L.A. area.
I called them last year and they don't make these louvered jobs any
more. They vectored me to a large and long time distributor of their's
in either Holister or Gilroy and they laughed. Ain't seen any o them
in years.

There you have it.

Chris.
