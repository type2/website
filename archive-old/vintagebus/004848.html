Hi,

Still looking. Anyone have a 64-67 that is being cut up? I
would like to have the right front corner. Needs to be good
from the upper door hinge on down. Some rust at the bottom
is OK (its normal). I can fix that. Mostly I need the pillar
from piece between the hinges as well as the front face
including the right head light bucket.

Chris
