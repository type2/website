&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm getting ready to do my first engine build, and was wondering if 
&gt; someone could throw me a list of tools I'm going to need. &gt;&gt;

&gt; Hi Aaron,
&gt; Not know you and how many engines you plan to do here below is a complete 
&gt; listing that we can think of.  You can do without alot of these if you have a 
&gt; shop do some of the specialized work for you.

Well, my current plans only include one engine, but I may build others in
the future. Some of these tools I already have, some I knew I needed, and
others I had no idea... Thanks for the list.

&gt; Hydralic press
&gt; Engine case boring bar
&gt; Head rebuild tools and fixtures.
&gt; Crankshaft pulley puller.

These should only be needed for a rebuild, correct?

&gt; Ring compressor
&gt;  0-6&quot; dial caliper.
&gt; Dial indicator.

These I knew I needed.... suggestions for places to buy these? What kind
of scale/throw do I need on the dial indicator?

&gt; Tool to install flywheel seal
&gt; Spring retainers to hold tappets in place while you put the case halfs 
&gt; together.
&gt; Adjustable pushrod to figure the length of push rods needed for proper
&gt; rocker/valve stem geometery.
&gt; Pexiglass fixture and a way to measure liquid ccs to cc the head 
&gt; chambers.

These I hadn't thought of.... once again, where is the best place to pick
these up?

&gt; Flywheel lock.

Should I buy something, or just build one out of angle iron?

&gt; Torque wrench.
&gt; Balance beam, or scale.

Hey... I already have these... is a 0-100ft lb. torque wrench sufficient?
