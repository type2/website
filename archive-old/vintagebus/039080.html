&gt;we stood on the edge of the campsite and watched all the busses 
&gt;try and make it up the HUGE hill in 2nd gear...HA HA HA HA HA!!!  
&gt;There were a few that had to resort to letting someone else climb 
&gt;into the driver's seat and get their busses up that monster hill.  

I made it in 2nd!  Of course I was in my dual-Webered Westy, but I did
make it in 2nd.  That was one steep muther!

Jerome was rough.  It was information overload for me.  In the past 5
years, I've probably only seen 150 different buses (most of them loafs
and only 3 or 4 trucks) around the S. Texas area.  Then, in 1 day, in 1
place I saw twice that many with over half of them splitties and about a
fourth of those seemed to be single or crew cabs.  Absolutely
overwhelming!!

Anyone know what the final split/loaf/bug/other count was?????

I'll probably do Buses by the Arch next year, but I'll be back at Jerome
in 2000 or 2001.
