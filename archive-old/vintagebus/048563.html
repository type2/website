Did anyone see the big write up in Trends this month about SOTO?  It seems
Trends really supports the club and with their circulation, they may have
given the club a big boost.  In the article, they really build up the club
and one get's the feel that SOTO is the only bus club around!!  They don't
even mention NEATO.

&gt;I think you are right, Steve.  SOTO has given too many of it's members the
&gt;&quot;brush&quot; in recent years.  I think this may spell the official demise of the
&gt;old club.  I'll see you at the OCTO show also!!!

&gt;&lt;&lt; Not sure if you'll get much support for that event on this list Andrew.  I
&gt; could be wrong though.  Most people that I run into are going to support the
&gt; NEATO sanctioned O.C.T.O. event that will take place the same day down at the
&gt; Pond in Anaheim CA.   This event is being promoted as the co-event to the VW
&gt; Classic that is put on by Rich Kimball of Periscope Ent.  The O.C.T.O. event
&gt;is
&gt; Saturday the 12th and the VW Classic is the 13th.
&gt;
&gt; This &quot;head to head&quot; scheduling was done for a reason I believe.  Many people
&gt; were fed up with things that happened and didn't happen with the &quot;non-profit&quot;
&gt; SOTO club.  Turn outs to both events will tell if the people have spoken.
