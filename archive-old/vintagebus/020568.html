But, if you're by the side of the road (as I was),
just clamp your pocket vice grips (4&quot; or 5&quot; - doesn't
everyone carry a pair?) on the nipple several times to
&quot;knurl&quot; it, and use locktite.

If a nipple comes off instead of the rubber line, I
clean the nipple and its socket in the carb *squeaky*
clean with carb cleaner and let it dry.
I roll the part of the nipple that goes into the
carburator on a hard surface with a file to put a bit
of a knurl into the metal.  I then mix up a small
batch of JB-Weld (a fuel-proof epoxy).  A tiny amount
of the 
epoxy goes into the socket and the rest coats the
knurled portion of the nipple.
Tap the nipple home, leaving the small bead of epoxy
around the place where the nipple emerges from the
carburator.  Let this sit for a day or
two to cure completely.  I've never had a nipple
installed in this way pull out.
