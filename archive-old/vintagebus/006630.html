If you are looking for a seal for the overrider to bumper, try the Porsche B
or C car seals, Porsche used these on all there bumpers and they would look
factory. Chuck Notmyer from Reno has these on his Sundial camper and they
look awesome, I guess VW was to cheap to install these. They are available
from The Parts Shop in Huntington Beach, Cal. and Stoddard Import Cars in
Indiana and any Porsche supplier, If there is a big enough demand I can
stock this item

I finally got the bumpers painted and they really look nice.  They will
match my nice shinny bus :).  My question:  is it worth putting any type
of rubber seal between the overriders and the blade on the front and
rear bumper.  Does anybody have experience with using some type of seal
or just leaving it metal on metal?  I realize that VW shipped the
bumpers out of the factory with out any seals but the rust between my
overriders and the blade was pretty bad.  Thanks.
