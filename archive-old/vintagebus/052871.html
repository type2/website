Subject: Re: [VB] Fwd: Old Car Scrappage Alert

Hi Volks,
We do not like the general gist of this bill either, but have found a few 
mistakes in the Email concerned about it.  What would be really interesting 
to find out is how much would the credit be for one vehicle.  Since if the 
vehicle is running and registered the credit will have to be enticing enough 
to get people to turn in thier cars.  Of course skullduggery can happen if 
some scapper figures a way around the rules, which should not be too hard.

  One can view the bill at:

&lt;&lt;  - ignores the fact that vehicles that are turned in for scrappage often 
do not run and are not even capable of being driven or are a second or third 
vehicle that has little or no impact upon overall fuel economy.&gt;&gt;

The bill states:
(2) requires that all passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks turned in 
be currently registered in the State in order to be eligible;

(3) requires that all passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks turned in 
be operational at the time that they are turned in;

(4) restricts automobile owners (except not-for-profit organizations) from 
turning in more than one passenger automobile and one light-duty truck in a 
12-month period;
