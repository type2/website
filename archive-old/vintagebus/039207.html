Subject: '59 Kombi...it's official!!!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Message-Id: &lt;E14LqU9-00051M-00_at_mister.frogspace_dot_net&gt;

It's official. I drove my '59 Kombi to work today and just took it to get
inspected. The guy was REAL cool. He didn't even get in it and drive it or
test brakes or nothin'. He checked my lights and blinkers, which all work,
and checked my insurance...but that was it. I told him a guy in my VW club
told me that his place did inspections, and asked if I could take a stack
of his business cards for other club members. Don't know if it helped or
not. I know it seems obvious...but that's the way things work in a rural TX
town. Very &quot;technically&quot; corrupt. You gotta learn to go with the flow.

So it looks like my bus will now be transporting me to and from work,
except for bad weather days. I've got a garage for it and don't really HAVE
to drive it around in the rain...so I'm not gonna. Plus it'll hail out here
in a second if your not carefull. Does it all during spring. Very strange
weather here in west texas.

So I bought the bus over 3 years ago. I've spent the last 1 1/2 years
fixing it up on what little spare time and money I had. I learned tons and
had fun all the way.

I&quot;ve still got to do the vinyl on my Z-bed and my front bench seat. I'm
using the bench that came with my '59 truck at the moment. It's got a black
cover that's in pretty good shape. I also need to fab me some panels for
the cab roof area. After that.....I'm done with the fancy stuff. It'll be
the normal maintanence and fixing of antique vw components. 

I'm glad to finally be a vw driver again.
