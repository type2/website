Subject: Re: [VB] Stud size vs head type

&gt; something?

The cylinders are iron and grow almost the same as the studs.  The
aluminum heads grow faster than the studs and result in pull-out or
breakage.  You're right in that case growth is a minor concern, both from
a geometry standpoint and from one of temperature change.  The heads get
much hotter than the case.
