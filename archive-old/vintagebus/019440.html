Never bothered to paint mine. So much for the anal
vintage reputation...
I'd suggest airbrush frisket paper purchased from a
real art supply store. Frisket is also available in
liquid form.
I would concur with the thin coat of paint rather than
hugely thick build up. You can imagine that VW was
doing them in mass production.

Like a dummy, I passed on an offer to snag a set of
German NOS chrome caps when the bus was completed.
After spending a billion dollars on the &quot;resto&quot; I
didn't pony up the... $35.00 each for the set. Dang! I
would do it in a second at this point. On the other
hand what should be on the bus according to the M-code
plate is one color Pearlweiss body with painted greys
anyhow. Who cares? We've had tons of fun anyhow. =)
