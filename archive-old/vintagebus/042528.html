On this note:

My 61 had a problem where the drivers side rear brake was much tighter
than the passenger side.

I finally tracked it down to the flexible sheathing for the parking brake
cable not being properly seated where it hooks onto the metal tube that
goes up front... might be worth a look-see. added about an inch to the
path the cable had to take allowing too little slack etc.

take care,

Steve
