Subject: I can hear a pin drop

Well almost and in comparison with how it has been, most definitely.

Was at my local surplus house last week and found some rolls of uncompressed wet
suit material.  48&quot; x 56&quot; each roll.  the material is closed cell foam and about
1&quot; thick.  It was pushing 90 here in SoCal today so it could not have been a
better day to work on the project.  The two rolls covered the sides of the
double cab, rear and front and the roof.  I have one more roll (but not at home)
that I will use back in the rear inside the fire wall, the rear seat pedestal
and the front.  I then went to Home Depot and picked up some 1/8&quot; board and cut
some new panels to cover the doors and side.

TALK ABOUT QUIET.  I'm only half done and already the difference is remarkable.
I could actually hear myself think when I took it out for a drive tonight.  I
can't wait to get that last roll and finish up.

Once done, the next big improvement to the quiet will be to eliminate the dual
exhaust and build up a merged system and go back to one muffler.  I'll miss that
nice deep rumble of the type IV dual exhaust, but why not let the engine do some
of the work keeping it quiet.

 I'll just have to start calling it the LimoCab if it gets much quieter.

Scott
