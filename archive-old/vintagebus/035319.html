I'm not sure if parts needed is acceptable on the list, but I really need a

front floor section for my 64 bus.

I'm not looking for the reproduction side panels by the doors (though mine

are gone). I need the WHOLE front floor.

I have nothing to bolt the shifter to, or anything like that. Does anyone

know of a source that either sells a replacement panel or a good used one?

sorry, cant help.   I cut a large piece of a junked bus to get a replacement 
front floor for my 61 w/ OE safaris and thus swiss cheese front floor.

BTW, the shifter does not bolt to the floor on a 64, but to  piece under  the 
floor, through the floor.
