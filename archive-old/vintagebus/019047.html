Anyone else dealt with Kustom 1 Warehouse?

================================================

They are a few miles from me and I've stopped in to pick up a few &quot;unimportant&quot; things from them.  I've never had anything shipped.  

My impression is that they are the low end of the resellers.  They stock only the cheapest of the imported stuff.  I would not buy anything I really wanted to last, like engine/transmission parts.  They are the Johnny's Speed and Chrome of the 2000's (Southern CA ref. only).  I'll buy oil change stuff, and tune up parts from them and that is about it.  I go there in a pinch since they are the closest.  The counter staff, with few exceptions are about as sharp as butter a knife.

BTW, we are possibly going to lose a good So. CA VW shop in the near future.  Got word at Pomona that the owner of Kymco is quitting.  Selling the building too.  Possibly one of the employees will take over, but nothing was set as of the last Pomona.  Cross your fingers.

Steve
