A wood craftsman like Robert Davis would look at the
photos that JP sent and 'scipher it out in a Santa
Barbara minute.

I think that item is the deluxe super custom rarest of
the rare Westfalia toilet bucket for people who can
crouch down really small while doing their business.
That kind of covers the porta-potty topic that I
missed while camping with several incessantly
screaming pre-seven year olds. &lt;Speaking of
porta-pottys~ Oy vel!&gt; Somebody hand me &quot;Thank you for
not breeding&quot; bumpersticker. I can't wait to get back
to work to get a vacation...

Question:
&quot;Shouldn't a porta-potty more accurately be called a
Porta-pooty?&quot;
Why do they call it a porta-potty when it would be
used mostly by the pooty-ownin' crowd? The bus fellas
that I know would just as soon pull over and open the
cargo doors to 90 degrees so traffic won't see and
drop trow while hangin on to the rocker panels... I
mean that's what makes I-10 the drive that we love so
well.
