The last time I dipped a rack, here's how I did it: 

set the rack on some crates or buckets so the feet are suspended - choose
a working height that's best for you.

cleant the feet with a good solvent, let dry.  Lightly sand the surface with #100 or so to give the plastic something to cling to.  Clean again.

Put the plasti-dip in a wide, shallow container, ie cottage cheese container.

Mark how high you want to go, as once you're immersed, you won't be able to
tell how far down the plastic is.  Masking it might work for a &quot;sharper&quot;
line, but that might also give it more of an edge to catch and peel.

&quot;dunk&quot; the leg buy lifting the container up into the leg.  

lower the bowl, but hold it to let the stuff drip.

Cover the bowl with something to keep it from drying, and let the leg dry
for the allotted &quot;between coat&quot; period.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

Yes, you need several coats.  Don't put it on with a brush, it looks like
crap!  

I also did this to replace the rubber covers on the ends of the sunroof bows on the '56.
