Subject: [VB] restore or not to

	I say restore it I know some people think it is important to
keep them original to show its journey through live, but I think that
all VW's would want to be brand new. I know this is just metal on
wheels, (no flames) but it is like people most of us look back at our
younger years and say hey I wish I could be young again.  


Enough said,
