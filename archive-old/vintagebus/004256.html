East Coast people:
  I don't know if the Fresno '63 DC is still available that I posted
details about a few days ago, ... it has NO RUST! As a bonus, you can
drive it home. $4k asking price. A good Internet-connection story and
East coast &quot;they're all rusting away here&quot; story could drop that price.
I've got mine and fixed the coastal rust. *#_at_$_at_#$) Take a flight and get
a solid one. I can get someone to drive it to the Classic in SoCal if
you want.

OCTO: I'm getting my '63 DC together for the trip. Looking for any
Central/Northern CA caravans coming down 99, or meet you at the base of
the Grapevine on Interstate 5. I can leave anytime on Fri. the 11th. If
the DC isn't together, I'll have my trusty '74 Thing.
As a Left Coast tribute to Josh, after the OCTO meet, 1ish, I'm buying a
round or two at the brewpub near the duckpond in Anaheim. If it's on
Katella, it's JT Schmids.  Would bring down some of my homebrew, but who
drinks Belgian ales?
