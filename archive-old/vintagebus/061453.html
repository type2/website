Subject: Won't start with new carb.

I just ran my battery down trying to start my 67
deluxe. I had pulled the engine to fix the tranny.
While the engine was out, I replaced the original 30
PICT Solex with a new Brosol 30/31 PICT replacement.

That is the only thing I did to the engine. Honest.

I tried starting it four times, letting in turn over
for about ten seconds each time, holding down the gas
pedal.
The fuel filter filled up with gas, so the pump is
working, all electrics on the bus work. Verything
seems to be hooked up right. Does it just take a lot
of cranking to get the gas into and through a totally
empty carb?

One other thing: My old carb had three connections: 1)
Fuel line 2) Vacuum line 3) electric choke wire.

The new carb has three other additional hose inlets
(capped) and one other electrical connection.

Please refer to this labeled pic I took

http://www.geocities_dot_com/jelm2/brosol.jpg

I hooked my lines up 1 2 3 as described above, then
4,5,6 are the three other unused inlets. 7 is the
other electrical connection.
Am I missing something with this one? Or are these
additional connections for other engines. Mine's a
1500 SP 1967. 

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
