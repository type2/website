Hi all,
this was on the type 2 list, reply to Scott not me,
thanks

&gt;Hey Y'all,
&gt;..In the&quot;little Nickel&quot; a news paper in Wa state, there is a 56  Ambulance
for
&gt;sale. It is missing the engine and most of the medical equiptment, but
&gt;has the &quot;oven door&quot; rear door, side step, divider, and fans. It is
&gt;complete minus the engine as far as bus stuff. I don't have the money
&gt;to buy it myself so I pass it on to you. Pick up a &quot;Little Nickel&quot; or
&gt;mail me and I will pass on the phone #.
