Hello again...

Thanks for the uplifting responses!  We all know that there are times when
positive feedback from others can boost morale, and give a nice shove to
one's momentum.  This is the time when I need to think/rethink things
through before going forward, as the closer I come to actually painting,
every move is critical.

&gt;I was especially interested in your compressor setup.  I have a 5 HP 20 gal
portable Sears rig that I have been thinking of upgrading.  What is the deal
with your drains?  I vent mine after each use, but I have noticed,
especially when sandblasting that I get some moisture.  Is this a setup that
can be purchased, or did you make it yourself?

To which I reply:  That extensive looping of copper tubing and
filter/regulator/drain system is homemade;  the design of which came from
many a source.  In photo #3 on my rig page,
http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Rig.htm , you see the first
condenser/drains....these valves seem to get rid of a good amount of water,
but only after the tank has cooled a bit.  After these, the air flows
through approx. 50' of copper before reaching another drain spot, from which
most of the water has condensed and can be drained directly into the bucket
of cooling water that my silly loop-of-copper condenser unit lives in.  That
primary drain valve, if you look closely, is actually on the bottom of a
loop itself, so if it gets full, the passage of air will not push too much
of the water further along the lines.  After the condenser in a bucket, the
air travels to a toilet-paper filter (Motorguard) which, I must say, kicks
booty.  And then (finally) to a Devillbiss regulator/filter/trap, which I
have to occasionally drain water from (but not much...see next answer)
There are some design changes that I will be making at some point (later)
like having the horizontal piping on the ceiling tilt back towards the tank,
and putting a drain on the loopy condenser unit.

&gt;Does your compressor (looks like
a 6 hp single stage?) provide plenty of air for blasting?

Answer:  I guess it does! (barely)  It is a 6.5hp single stage 60 gal (wish
I could have afforded two stage).  With blasting, it runs about 75% of the
time (don't tell the warranty guys that!), yet with my DA sander, it runs
100%!  I have to drain the system most frequently with the DA
sander.....fortunately, it only runs 25-30% of the time with my HVLP gun set
up for high solids primer, so I don't have any problems as far as critical
volume/pressure requirements!

&gt;If you don't mind me asking, how will you set up the paint booth, and
where, and
what will it cost?  I just went to Maaco for lack of a place to use my spray
gun.

Answer:  Oh, you're gonna love this!  Check out the carport-like structure
over the bus in question at
http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Progress3.htm
That is the basis for my booth.  That particular unit was $149, and with a
large tarp underneath on the cleaned ground, with the excess folded up and
affixed to the poles, and clear plastic covering the ends and the remaining
spaces on the sides, possibly with an airlock-type door in the front, I
should be able to spray without bugs.  I'll be using a box fan or two and
several filters to provide positive pressure ventilation, with a filtered
exhaust on the other end.  Temperature control is up to the gods (let us
spray), and the big flap at the end, as well as the door for me will be
closeable with 2&quot; Velcro.  The whole thing is designed to be torn down,
packed away when not in use, but can be re-used later (with the possible
exception of the clear plastic bit.  I'll only be spraying in the day, and
hopefully, I won't have to spend a bunch on lighting.  My biggest problem
with it is that I can't open the front doors all the way.  Oh well!

&gt;just one question, why are you using the 12&quot;
square tiles for the floor as opposed to single sheet vinyl. I just
installed
single sheet vinyl floor in my bus(replacing the original single sheet) I
think
there has got to be an advantage of the single sheet. The individual tiles
leave more access points for water or other debris to get under them. With
all
the twisting and flexing of the bus, I would think that the tiles are much
more
likely to pop up

Answer:  uh....well, I guess that we are used to the individual tiles (used
them in our house), and I haven't removed the camping interior completely.
(Yet.....later, it all comes out so I can inspect/fix the cargo floor
metal).  They are cheap enough so that we can remove/fix them if necessary,
yet what you say makes sense.....I guess of now I will put a bead of clear
silicone between each tile....that'll help for now, anyway.  As far as tiles
popping up....little nails work wonders!  BTW, the interior is not something
that I am really concentrating on yet.  The Pearl White paint I got matches
well enough so that while I am spraying the outside, I can do quick little
fixes of the interior here and there....I save the dash for later, though.
I did put rust converter on the parts of the interior that have problems,
but that, and the offhand spraying will be temporary.

So long!
