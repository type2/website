Subject: Re: [VB] 63 wiper mechanisms

I recently noticed the same issue with my 65 westy.

there is supposed to be 2lbs (? if i remember right) pressure on the glass 
from the wiper.  

 you can try pulling the wiper in and out (like when you lift it off the 
glass to use the cleaner at the gas station) and squirt some wd40 at the spring in 
the wiper arm.

if that doesn't work you can bend the wiper arm to see if that adds pressure 
to the glass, like if the spring springs then,

if all else fails, get another wiper arm.

&lt;&lt; I have a 63 singlecab and the passengers side does not wipe well.
 I have changed the blades and it still is lousy.
 Is there a way to increase the pressure of the wiper on the window, this way 
I will be able to see out of both windows when I use my squirters!
