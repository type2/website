 I was wondering if anyone has replaced the push rod seals while the engine
 was still in the bus.  I have a '60 panel with a single port AE case.  The
 sucker is leaking and I want to fix it, but I had knee surgury 4 weeks ago
 and it limits me a bit.  Any ideas?
  &gt;&gt;
you can use the two part push rod tubes.   Make sure you readjust the valves
in a couple hundred miles.


That they are leaking there makes me wonder if the motor has been rebuildt so
long ago that it needs a bit of help, and if it is leaking atthe main/oil
cooler seals.  I would wash the engine to make it easier to identify leak
sources.
