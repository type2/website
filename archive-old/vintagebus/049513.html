&gt;There is no feedback, no feel through the steering wheel, power brakes
&gt;don't even give you a feel for the effort the brakes are making.  Call it
&gt;tactile feedback.  All you feel is the 'exhilarating rush of power' when
&gt;you step on the gas, centripetal force when you corner.  You're in a cushy
&gt;environment with your 6 speaker surround sound 6 cd player, air
&gt;conditioning, and cruise control.  Oh yeah, don't forget the cell phone.
&gt;All these distractions.



exactly. when the bus (or 50 chevy 1/2 ton) is at its limit, I
KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!  and i back off.
idiots who think that all those cushy safety bells and whistles will save
them in a disaster (hey, ya STILL have ta know how to control a skid, even
WITH abs!) endanger us more than the knee-breakers we call vws.

and BTW, somewhere out there on WWW there is a RPI study of vw accident
injuries - broken knees, elbows and forearms, with the occ. steering wheel
in the gut.  will definitely make you drive safer!!
