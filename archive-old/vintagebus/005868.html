&quot;hey all..
while filling up the bus today I watched the gas like always...but this&quot;

I doubt that any damage was done. Diesel is just oil, dirty oil but oil none the less. Clean the tank and the filter thoroughly. Refill with GAS and you should be fine. Perhaps you even extended the life of the engine?

Now, this is what I don't understand. Have the olfactory nerves in your town been affected by something? There is a huge difference in the smell of gasoline and the smell of diesel. The delivery guy didn't smell it? The pump jockey didn't smell it? You didn't smell it? WOW!
