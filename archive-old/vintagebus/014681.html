&gt; Hi:
&gt; Does anybody know if I can reregister my 63 bus with california
&gt; black 
&gt; dealers plates?  Thanks.

Black plates, sure, if you have the correct plate and sticker to go
with the car.  Dealer's plates?  I don't know.  Are you a dealer?

Talk to the DMV.  Best to go into a small office, not a big metro
office.  Ask nicely.
