Subject: Re: [VB] 30 Pict Jets

I believe the reply was and is valid. Why does the original poster 
question the jetting of the carb?

The series of jets in the carb are intended to provide the proper 
air/fuel mix at differing loads/RPMs.

For example, the 009 dizzy requires a larger pilot jet in the carb than 
the vaccum advance dizzy, due to the faster advance curve.

Unless they are having reportable symptoms of an improper air/fuel mix, 
why suspect the carb jetting? That's why I asked the question.

 I really doubt he's running an original, stock pre '68 engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It should come from the factory with the correct jets. Why do you question

&gt;it? &lt;&lt;
&gt;Hi Douglas,
&gt;Factory jets yes, but for what?
