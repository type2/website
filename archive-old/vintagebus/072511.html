Subject: Re: [VB] spedo cable

Take the &quot;nut&quot; off of the back of the speedo. Pop off your hubcap  and remove the &quot;C&quot; clip that holds the speedo cable to the bearing cap and bend back the clips that hold the speedo cable to the frame, taking note of how it is routed. Remove drivers side kick panel. You should be able to pull the cable up and out from your package tray. I usually pull from behind the kick panel as I can see where I need to push the new cable through while the old one is still in.Pretty easy stuff.  Sean
