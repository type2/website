Subject: Replacing Fuel Lines?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Howdy Folks..Well, I got my bus up on ramps..and
getting ready to clamp my fuel lines..However, I
thought since I'm under there and gonna be
disconnecting hoses(which are the &quot;canvas like&quot;
hoses..if that makes any since) I may as well replace
all my fuel hoses. Could someone tell me the best type
of hose to use and How many hoses I should be
replacing..I just don't want to miss any. Will this be
a difficult task? I don't want to get in over my head
here. Also, Can I just buy the type of hose I need at
say an Autozone? Thanks for all your help!..Hmmm,
Maybe if I can actually get this done...I can try to
figure out how to adjust valves..:-)

thanks,

Greg
