ANYBODY with Windows can hit the PrtScr key, go to Paint and hit Edit, =
Paste for a free copy of their screen. I use a free utility called =
PrintKey2000 to selectively scrape stuff off the screen.=20



...and disabling javascript neuters 99% of those right-click traps.

I find stuff from my site scattered all about the web, like the
pic of my '56 on the GEX web site, and I've seen the album cover
I scanned all over the place.  OTOH, I have no qualms about macking
pix from ebay and putting them up...
