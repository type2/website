Thom,

What cabinet is missing in your kit? I might know of a spare to buy or use
for a template. The kit that is installed in your 1955 is from a later 1960
campbox correct? Do you have any of the cabinets for the earlier campbox? I
know of a guy in Idaho that has a campbox out of a 1956 westy for sale if
interested. Price is kinda steep though, but that way you might be able to
get more $$$ for your westy since it has the &quot;correct&quot; kit inside.
