The best way to tell if there is a lot of rust inside the area between the
floor and belly pan is to look up underneath on the back part of the
floor/belly pan next to where the tranny nosecone (shift coupling) mounts.
On top of the outriggers and last cross beam look to see if they look okay
or are rotted through. Then go to the front of the cargo area and do the
same. Also press on the metal to see if it is hard, soft, or pushes through,
you get the idea. This is all I can think of aside of pulling the pans (not
pretty).

If you have access to an airgun there are drain holes on the outer pans
toward the center pan and the center pan should have them as well. Blow the
dirt out of there cause I'm sure there's build up and make sure they are
open so if any water gets in there it will drain properly. This blockage is
the cause of a lot of rust problems (dirt build up holds water moisture, in
turn rusts through in that area and spreads) same goes for rockers.

&gt; Is there any way to check for rust under the cargo
&gt; floor?

&gt; but the driver's side rocker needs replacing,
&gt; and the lip in the floor near the cargo door latch is
&gt; crusting away.
&gt;
&gt; I'd hate to go through the expensive paint thing and
&gt; then have it rot from the inside out.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice is appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
