&gt;I am about to restore a nice '63 Kombi, and am deciding on a beefier
&gt;engine.
(snip)
&gt;Anyway, my question to anyone is: Can you recommend the ideal engine setup,
&gt;in terms of carbs, ignition, flywheel, clutch, trans, axle setup, etc. to
&gt;make this a super-reliable, smooth-running, hill-conquering,
&gt;casual-cruising, quiet-running sweet little honey of a daily-driver Kombi?
&gt;


Sounds to me like you want a Chevy 350 with an automatic. No matter how many
modified engine and tranny components you put in it, it ain't gonna be a
Nissan. It's an antique VW. Lots of upgrades and modifications provide a
benefit in terms of power, speed, longevity, etc. but at a cost. Most of us
that fool with these things do it because we like to tinker with them on a
nearly continual basis. If your definition of super-reliable means it will
get you home almost every time under its' own power, it's possible. If it
means write a check and it will never require a second thought, forget about
the old bus. You can't get there from here.
