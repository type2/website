Subject: Re: Last year of Semaphore????

OOPPS, Just checked my serial number on my Bug's title...according to
the serial number it IS a `60 model bug...even though my US title says
it is a `61!    

Also looked in the VW Parts manual and semaphores on buses ended at
around chasis # 614000 which was May of `60...which is the `60 model
year.....

SOOO Looks like `60 was the last year for sema's after all...I stand
corrected.

Todd S


&gt; Yes, I do..I just bought a `61 European bug with semaphores...and also
&gt; my buddy in Germany has a `61 Bus with semaphores.
