Subject: is puyallup water cooler too?
Message-ID: &lt;2BDC26AF207FD211948D00805FC772E51208F3_at_FS17-NT-EX3-VAN&gt;

Just wondering if the Puyallup show is water cooled as well. If it is I may
not have to drive down alone. A friend of mine is a water cooled buff. 

Has anyone had any experience bringing dogs across the border in and out of
Canada?

Bob
