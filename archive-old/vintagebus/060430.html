Subject: DLX coat hok trades.

I bought some NOS coat hooks for a DLX, thinking I needed the metal
ones. They are pretty nice, but one has the spring steel part under the
clip slightly oxidized. I polished the metal with flitz and they look
great. Will trade for the 5? Plastic ones (OG mint or NOS preferred) a
66 DLX requires. I have no screws for these, but would request I get
screws for the plastic ones.
I would also trade for 66-67 only sienna beige/aero baleric rear kick
panel, and partially for side door lock tumbler (with key would be extra
nice).
I paid about 40.00 for the clips.


Thanks,
AL
