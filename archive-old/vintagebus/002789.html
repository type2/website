Subject: Re: [VB] B pillar repro ..not so good han!

&gt; it happen that i got a B-pillar, passenger side from Motorworks, was
ordered
&gt; before i thought of kelly at metalwizard, then today i cut my old
B-Pillar,
&gt; now figured out to put the new one, but i notice small (big) difference
...
&gt; as the original one has the corner more &quot;square&quot; .. the repro has kind of
&gt; more round corner, then the place where the door rubber go isnt equally
&gt; solded to the repro as result that the upper door rubber slot dont fit
&gt; &quot;flush&quot; with the one on the bus.

The corner being a different radius is a bad problem. You can't really use
filler there, it will probably crack and fall off. Try to hammer the corner
back to the correct radius before you weld it to the bus.

The gap in the weatherstipping runner is minor and can be fixed.

&gt; Now are they brand name in this kind of repro think, or they are all made
by
&gt; the same machine same places... how do you know when you order from place
&gt; like Motorworks or else that they have a good brand, not a cheapo one ??

They are probably made in Brazil. I've seen other repro stuff from Denmark
that Alan Shoefeld sold.

You don't know if its any good until you see it. At least RMM has a good
return policy.

Don't cry too much. This piece would be &quot;very&quot; hard to fabricate and they
don't charge harding anything for it.
