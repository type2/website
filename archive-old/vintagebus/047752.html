&lt;&lt;  I've notice a drop of  brake fluid accumilating on the under side of the 
MC casting by the mounting bolts and one drop under the looped short metal 
line to bridge the front  circuit.  When I bleed the brakes only the rear 
drivers side squirts with good pressure.  The other three wheels have a spurt 
of spray and then spit a little and stop.  &gt;&gt; snip  &lt;&gt;
Hi Eric, 
Sounds like you need to first tighten the metal line to the front brakes and 
get into the brake system that has the fluid to seal it by tightening a metal 
line there or replacing a leaky slave cylinder.
  Then bleed the whole system this way.
8.  Adust all the brake stars too tight so the brakes drag alot on each wheel.
9.  Bleed brakes begining with the one farthest from the driver's seat on the 
front axle and then the closer front brake cylinder.  
10.  Do the same with the rear brakes as #9.
11.  Adjust the brake stars so the brakes just drag here and there when hand 
spining each wheel.  Start with the fronts and get a feel for this because 
the rears are also dragged by differential in the tranny so are harder to get 
the feel for the job.
