Subject: [VB] Single cab authenticity
Message-ID: &lt;0.6de9c8b2.2597aed6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Recently I acquired a 1967 single cab, and plan an ongoing restoration 
(restification might be a better word) once it is running.  When I buy parts, 
I am concerned most with authenticity, so I don't have to do anything twice 
(or undo something I did).  Can anyone give answers to these questions:

1.  bed slats--According to Meredith's &quot;Original VW Bus,&quot; pickups came with 
wooden bed slats.  My bed has no holes where these would be screwed down.  
Were the slats optional, only on certain years, what?

2.  bumpers--Did my single cab come with the plain strips, or were there 
overriders and towel bars (it is a US model)?  Did chrome bumpers ever appear 
on trucks?  Regards repops, are there varying qualities as in beetles, or are 
they all about the same?  Are original bumpers much more desirable?

3.  I want safari windshields.  What should I know, like original vs. 
reproduction value and quality; more than one manufacturer?; also do I have 
to modify the wipers to use these windshields?

4.  Tires--I just gotta have radial whitewalls.  From what I read, they 
should be 14&quot;.  Smaller sizes are hard to find, so how big a tire can I use 
(on stock steel wheels) without modifying anything?

Thanks for reading.
