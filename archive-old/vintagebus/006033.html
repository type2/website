Hopefully interest in this hasn't waned too far, it took a bit to complete
the page with the semester coming to a close (finals + research paper +
registration + job = AUGH!).  Here's the addy:

http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/eb2k.htm

The rest of the site is sorely in need of updating, and I haven't got any
more scanning done...I'm going to spend some quality time after classes end
this week :-)  I'm still driving around with a bent torsion arm, didn't have
time to replace it this weekend!

An aside:  I have tired of repeatedly bidding on a Westfalia camper parts
list/manual on eBay...it's a copy, gets listed like every week, same dude.
I don't want to pay over $15 for it as it's just a copy.  Lost once for
$15.01 (GRR!  :-)) and the last ones have gone for well over $20 (last one
near $30).  Anybody have one they can copy for me?  I'll happily pay cost
and postage.  I'd like to put it online with the other manuals.  Please
p-mail me.

Sayonara,

Andrew W.
