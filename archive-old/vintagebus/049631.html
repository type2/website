THANK YOU to all who posted regarding my tire questions; the gist seemed to
be: Bridgestone 603s are GREAT driving tires, but you WILL have problems in
sand, mud, gravel or wet grass.

The Bridgestone 603V (also known as RD603 et al) is a 1700 lb capacity,
8-ply (sic) tire... perfect for a bus. Sadly, it is NOT Mud + Snow, and is
a Highway Rib Light Truck, which means it really ain't too hot off the
macadam, and not legal in some states for winter use.

The Bridgestone Dueler A/T, which IS  great in mild off-road performance,
had a marginal (but factory approved) load capacity of 1435lbs/tire, and 2
ply side walls. I took a deep breath, realized that in the FIRST 6 years of
owning this bus, I was offroad 2/3 the time; the last 6, maybe 4 times.

I ordered the 603s.

Yokohama Y370Gs -  the unequivocable grand champeen of Listee preference in
the archives - is no longer made.

I hope that by the time I need new tires, there will be a tire like the
Yokohamas back in production.........


I will be getting these 603s tomorrow, mounting them this weekend, and
travelling all over Texas in June - you will all get a report :).
