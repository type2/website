&gt;Hi Jason,
&gt;What RPMS are you using for cruising?

Dont know, need to tach it. But assuming the tranny is standard I was going 
60 not over so should be ok.

&gt;Check you fan width which must be at least 33mm (35mm is better.) inside
&gt;measurement and the lower pulley a 2:1 ratio both especially a must for use
&gt;with doghouse shroud!

Looks ok.

Check for relief and regulator spring proper lengths.
Long length high pressure relief.

&gt;Make sure your idle and main jets are not too small or the air correction 
&gt;jet
&gt;too big any of which will cause it to run too lean.

Modified carb for engine, runs a bit rich,

Do you have all the
&gt;engine tin and seals including the seals for the doghouse system?

Seals in place, tin in place. Put extra effort in getting good insulation 
arounf dog house.

Is your
&gt;thermostatic flaps system operating

Flaps good, no thermostat.

&gt;   We have gone to the type 4 cooler in the


Would like a type 4 cooler, have one on hand. You guys still making the 
modification?

Has a type 3 cooler on it right now, dont know if its the one you are 
suggesting.

Jason

Put in 20w50 racing oil, that helped some. Smells different then regular 
oil. Not synthetic, but has a good package of high zinc content.
