Funny, I actually responded, and the 'great appreciation' promised is still yet to show up... 
Glynn is of course right, join the SSVC without delay. Buy my bus, you'll still have 
enough change left over to paint it whatever colour you like!
It's already lowered, so no probs there, and I can throw in the original unmodified suspension 
for free, I'm generous to a fault.

  ... 
&gt; i sent an e-mail earlier enquiring about buying a '65 splitty in blue and
&gt; white. any response to that would be greatly appreciated. (see 'i need
&gt; help')

impatience wont help much simon. ;)

do you really want to spend that much --  you can have my split in blue and
white if you like--- how'd you like it - stripes, zig zags?   - cool - i'll
buy three!
