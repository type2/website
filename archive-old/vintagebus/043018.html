&gt; i have never heard of a speedo on an old bus taking the deep six, they are quite simple and pretty much bullet proof..

I do not suggest taking one apart!  I did that when my first one went

around the rotating inductive cup, and if you try and 'fix' it, you will
ruin it. As I just posted,I believe there is a place called Hollywood
Speedometer, I believe they advertize in Hemmings.
