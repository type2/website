&gt;I have to second this .     The first time I replaced a generator I did it
&gt;this way- it worked fine.   a few years later I  had to replace a generator
&gt;on another bus, and was repeatedly told it couldn't be done with motor in
&gt;situ, and to pull the motor- took me longer to get him to stopping telling me
&gt;how to do it than it did to actually do it.  &lt;grr&gt;
&gt;
&gt;but...  there may be more than one answer.  There may  well be more than one
&gt;way to do things.  Do it the way that is best for you, and keep your mind
&gt;open.    There is so much to learn from people that I seem to learn the
&gt;wierdest stuff in unexpected places.  

I wasn't going to mention this, but...

I have replaced a generator without loosening the fan shroud...

1.  Fan off front shaft.
2.  Pulley off rear shaft.
3.  Loosen two long screws holding generator together, let nuts holding
backing (fronting?) plate fall off front end.
4.  Looosen generator clamp.
5.  Slide generator out without dropping shims.

Reverse to replace, except you can't put the nuts back on.

I have done this, but:  it was in the rain, on the side of I-85, and I
fixed it right, by pulling the motor, when I got home.  Any person who
leaves it this way is a lazy slacker and deserves whatever catastophe
befalls them when the generator slips and chews up the fan and
housing...but that's my opinion.
