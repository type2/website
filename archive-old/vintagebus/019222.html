I've had really good support for the pre-63 Bentley Transporter manual 
campaign so far; as of this writing there are 67 people signed on.  
But we need more!  It's going to take more than 67 people for Bentley to 
decide to make a run of these books!  Even if you don't have a pre-63
transporter right now, don't discount the possibilty of having one in
the future, you never know what might come your way!  I know a hard core
cal-look guy who just wasn't &quot;into&quot; buses, and now drives a single cab.
