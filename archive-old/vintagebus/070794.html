Subject: VW lovers, want a Bullmastiff?

We have one Bullmastiff puppy left. Her name is Empi. (aside from the VW
&quot;Empi&quot; it's short for &quot;KDF's Empire strikes back&quot;). If there are any list
members who are looking for a Bullmastiff puppy we would love to see her go to
another VW Family. She is a beautiful very dark brindle girl. She is CKC
registered, vet checked, microchipped, had first shots, and is dewormed. Pet
price is $1000, show/breed price is $1800. Could easily be AKC registered. She
is out of our CH &quot;Only Samba For Me&quot; who was bred to the #1 Bullmastiff in
Canada &quot;Janhamers So Irresistabull&quot;.
