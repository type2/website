Paint the entire bus the bottom color then spray the
top the other....this is how all my old original paint
westys are-were......on my old `61 westy you can see a
tad of sealing wax red under the top color beige grey
in spots too....I think they did this to all two tones
up to `62 or `63....

Tds

&gt; We're finally getting close to painting the bus. 
&gt; I'm hung up on an originality paint issue, that
&gt; maybe I shouldn't concern myself with, but would
&gt; still like to know the answer if anyone knows for
&gt; sure.  I've seen mention of it before on the list,
&gt; but I searched the archives and found myself lost in
&gt; a sea of painting posts.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that with later two-tone buses, i.e. mid
&gt; '60's, the entire bus was first painted the lower
&gt; half color and then the upper half was sprayed with
&gt; the top color.  The question is, did VW do this on
&gt; all two-tone buses, even during the '50's, or was
&gt; there a year split when they started painting in
&gt; this fashion?
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line, should I paint my entire bus Mango
&gt; Green and then spray the top half with Sea Gull
&gt; Grey, or just paint below the beltline with Mango
&gt; and above the beltline with Grey?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
