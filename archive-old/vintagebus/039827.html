2 weeks to go before you can get your chili tested and proclaimed 'the 
Worlds BEST' by the internationally famous panel of secret judges.  The 
judging will be held Saturday April 21, 2001.  The not so secret location 
will be at the EveryBus campout at Hagen Stone State Park.  That's in North 
Carolina in case you were wondering.

Come camp, bring a pot of your best chili recipie, win valuable prizes, and 
help feed the hungry.  If you're not very careful, you might just have fun 
too!
