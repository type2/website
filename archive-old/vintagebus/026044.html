Richard,

Hell, boy, 25 mpg is great! Gotta remember, you are pushing a brick
through the wind.  I average 21mpg with a 1600 when I keep my foot out
of it. 
I got about 16mpg loaded to the gills running mexican gasoline at 10,000
feet and was tickled pink....or maybe that should be pickled pink from
the cheap cerveza....

&gt; just under 200 miles; that would be around 25MPG.  Is that good, bad or
&gt; sorta OK.  I have a 1500cc single port engine that I just rebuilt (the first
&gt; tank of gas to go thru the new engine) with a new carb.  This is a stock '67
&gt; with no whistles and bells.

&gt; I have never owned a type2 before, but I thought I would have had better
&gt; mileage (I suspect the fuel mixture is a bit rich but haven't had time
