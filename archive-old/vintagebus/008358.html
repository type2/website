 Need help, what is this? Found in the 66 microbus. A round brass? pin about
1 1/4&quot; in dia. Has &quot;reichstag&quot; on top with a factory or building with flags
at each end in the middle, below is &quot;besuch&quot; and below that is &quot;in&quot; and
below that is &quot;berlin&quot;. Has a funny style clasp on the back. Doesnt really
look that old, anyone know what it is?
