Bellypans... A pattern is available on the 'net, search for the recent links to the paper model SC and Deluxe. Blow it up to a wide plotter and you've got a pattern. Print it on Tyvex in color for a rust free version you can install with contact cement ;-) (hmm, add to all the sunroof toys that NEVER have a bellypan)

Radio static... Do NOT fix this with capacitors or filters or anything, it's part of the ambience. Also handy in our deadly Tule fog, you know the wipers are running, even when you can't see 'em. 

Karl and I rescued another bus from the salvage yard. A '66 walkthrough non-westy hardtop camper. I'll post pics and VIN today. No rust in the front floor, lots of woodwork, will tow it home tomorrow. Engine and a half. Also have a line on a BTS 61 camper that will be an organ donor. Trivia: Skin is the largest human organ.

Local manufacture tools?  Hot air popcorn popper to defrost engine, interior;  Pop-rivet tool for low power welding and kewl Frankenstein styling

Local club news.... Fresno, CA area, all aircooled (\X/). Meet at Bobby Salazar's Mexican restaurant in Old-town Clovis at 7 p.m. Monday, Jan. 8th.
