Hey c'mon Paul,
Those AZ guys will never know the pleasure of idling through hours of stop
and go (mostly stop) construction traffic on the Kennedy Expressway, in 90
plus degrees and humidity that's just as high. Or the pleasure of chipping
1/4 inch thick ice to get the doors open.
I drive my bus all year long, but not everyday, I've even taken it camping
in the winter. Illinois offers a variety of opportunities that those desert
guys will never know.
