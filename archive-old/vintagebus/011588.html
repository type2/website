Subject: Worthwhile Sandblaster!
Date: Wed, 12 Aug 1998 13:57:52 -0700

I have lots of useless sandblasters I've accumulated overthe years,
collecting dust.  Gravity feed blasters are all JUNK.
I just picked of a Harbor Freight-Chinese special
The key: Pressurized container
Holds maybe 5-8 gallons of sand, it is blown out under pressure, 75lbs I
believe.  Was on sale,
Half price special $99

This thing does work well on rims and bumper brackets, seat frames, small
to medium sized rust repair jobs.
I wouldn't want to do a whole bus exterior with it, a dash no problem.

Anyway, it does the job.
