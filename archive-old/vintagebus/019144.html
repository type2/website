There are a lot of LHD barndoors with the cargo doors on the left; there
are even &quot;normal&quot; buses setup that way.  Just because the doors are on
the wrong side, doesn't mean it's RHD.  In the Steinke/Sueme book, in
one picture a possibly incorrect assumption about an incomplete body shell
being RHD is made, simply because the doors were on the wrong side.

Model 213:Panel Van, Cargo Doors Left, LHD
Model 215:Panel Van, Cargo Doors Right and Left, LHD
Model 223:Standard Microbus, Cargo Doors Left, LHD
Model 233:Kombi, Cargo Doors Left, LHD
Model 263:Single Cab Pickup, Tool Compartment Lid Left, LHD
Model 267:Double Cab Pickup, Cab Door Left, LHD
Model 273:Ambulance, Cargo Doors Left, LHD

&gt; but why do you say its a LHD? loading doors are on the left ala rhd are they
&gt; not.. only looked that close myself a minute ago checking to see if i could
&gt; spot any original anti smog fittings to hint at a socal origin. got me
&gt; nearly interested enough to give them a bell and find out now. gotta stop
&gt; myself doing that! - i'll end up buying it :)
