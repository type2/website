Subject: Degreaser and a Dent for Lunch
Message-ID: &lt;374C98AC.ACC624DA_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Greetings, fellow bussers,

I had to kill a couple of hours of personal time at lunchtime today, so
I spent them on my baby...

I had a nice dent in the rear hatch from last year, when at a large
party someone moved my bus to get thier car out, and backed up into a
small tree. Much thanks to them... At any rate, I banged most of it out
today with a hammer and a piece of 1x4. It looks a lot better.

I also attacked the engine compartment with 3 bottles of professional
quality engine degreaser. It is amazing stuff, gets even thick deposits
of grease off. Also removes paint. Damn. I guess I'll be painting my
engine compartment soon. At least my engine compartment and lid are nice
and clean. Also found bolts to properly attach my rear apron. Cleaned up
the cab a little. 

Also had trouble starting my bus, so I could get it out of the way for
the cars that I had to park in the yard. Got the dizzy too wet, I
suppose. I wiped it out with a dry rag, and eventually she sputtered to
life.

This is pretty nice, having space, tools and time to fix up my long
neglected daily driver. I've depended on her for a long time now, it's
time to pay her back.

I've got a couple of hours to kill tomorrow, so I think I may fix a
stripped redux box bolt, maybe do a rear torsion adjustment... I'll keep
you posted... I have a pretty long list of things to do for her.
