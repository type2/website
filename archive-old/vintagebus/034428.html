&lt;&lt; Is there some way to get the broken pieces of screw out or have they 
permanently welded themselves to the shift rod? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
We had the same problem with our 1960 panel.  Finally after drilling out one 
of the square headed bolts we had to just cut the solid coupler with a torch. 
 Then found another coupler from Clara.  Took about four hours to get off the 
two pieces of cut coupler and the one from Clara off of the rear linkage that 
it was still attached to!
