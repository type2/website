Subject: Re: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

It's one of those large black ovally things, you push the ends together , 
twist,a dn it comes apart and there is a fuse in the middle.   Should be from the 
large red wire to the heater, which comes from ... the battery or voltage 
regulator or coil or something.

It's just that my then bf put a bn-4 in his 66 standard, years ago, and after 
a while if you moved the heat control knob the heater would die, and then 
you'ld  have to flick the reset, and not try to make the heat go up or down, 
though the on or off would work.   

I've messed with a couple bn-4s I'd like to put one in my bus, and I have 2 
that the blower works, but the fuel pump doesn't.  This is about the extent of 
my gas heater experience.

&gt; my 
&gt; problem, but I don't see one readily visible.
