Subject: Re: Package tray, under the seat, ash tray

Package and ash tray:
Factory didn't install them  ;(

Under the seat:
Clothes, spare parts (except whatever's gonna break), towel to lay on, lug
wrench, crank in case I feel like cranking, a disgusting amount of seat
padding and horsehair as my front seat disintegrates into nothingness.

Door pockets (my package tray):
Copy of owner's manual, registration, insurance, black log book of
maintenance, gas mileage, and the location of people with Buses or Type 3s
in their yards around Phoenix.

Behind the seat:
Extinguisher, &quot;traveling tools&quot;, rags to clean my hands or my dirty engine
or whatever, hub cap puller.

Other things of interest:
Roll of seat burlap and big roll of seat padding just to annoy any
passengers I pick up, spare tire I'd be scared to drive more than 1 mile on,
a very nice whisk broom to sweep the front floor mat.

Later,
Everett Barnes

======================================
&quot;Is your Bus supposed to be brown?&quot;
&quot;No, that's primer.&quot;
&quot;But.. primer is gray.&quot;
&quot;It comes in lots of colors.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot;
