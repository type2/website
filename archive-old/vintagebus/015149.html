Subject: right transmission for my 59?
Date: Thu, 10 Feb 2000 14:29:53 MST
Mime-Version: 1.0

  I read a message earlier this week that worried me.  I have a split case 
transmission in my 59 singlecab, which I was under the impression that was 
made in Nov. of 59.  The message read that transmissions were changed to 
tunnel trannys in May of 59.  I don't know my tag.  Will my Chassis # help?  
416631  Do I have the right transmission?
