Subject: [VB] Center Pivot Pin Replacement

I had the earlier post &quot;want less steering play&quot; and it was aptly suggested I look at the center pivot and replace it if bad.  Well, the cener pin wobbles around all over the place so I read the web page that was forwarded to me by steve, and I ordered a new pivot/bushing kit and have rented a reamer.  I have two concerns:

I can't find the bushing removal tool that was mentioned in the web page - anyone know where I can get it?, someone told me a chisel will work?

I asked a mechanic if he would do it for me because I didn't have the bushing remover and he said it was an awful job
and that he wouldn't do it.  This is a guy I respect, and hearing that got me a bit down, so I need some encouragement.. can I do this one ?  Keep in mind, I could tell some good stories to the Apartment dweller.  I will be doing this in a parking lot with the bus on jack stands.. There hasn't been a job I couldn't do so far, but I don't want to be half finished when it gets dark and have no way of steering the bus to get it out of the way..
thanks
