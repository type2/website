Subject: What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

I called to see how the progress was going on the bus .. The father wasn't
there, but one of the sons answered.
I said &quot;have you figured out what caused the case to crack.&quot;  He said .. &quot;that
the motor flexing.&quot;  I said &quot;huh ?? what does that mean ..&quot;  and he stumbled
around for words and basically said &quot;we are fixing it with a brace.&quot;  Anyone
have any idea what he is saying or what it means ?? I will drill the owner
better if I know what I am supposed to ask.

Diane
