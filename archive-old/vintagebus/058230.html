&lt;&lt; anybody know, or have a guess, if front beams can easily be swapped out
 between splitties? i know that some ppl do the 68-69 beam swap, but i'm
 looking at 64-67 into my 59 bus. if so, is ride height affected, as in the
 bay window beam conversion?

you can put a 64-67 beam in a 63/earlier bus with no problems.   The only 
practical difference is that the steering damper attached both end to the 
beam on the later beam, one end to the beam and one to the bus on the earlier 
style.   

Careful of the shift linkage when swapping! You'll have to take it apart at 
the forward coupler.
