&lt;&lt; The wobble is only on the side of the belt closest to carb, and is about 
1/4&quot; in movement. Even disappears above 1700rpm, but slight and noticible at 
idle. Pulleys are lined up and tight.  &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
Sounds normal.  That side of the belt is the slack side, like the lower part 
of a bicycle chain.  Though the belt is more stretchy than a metal chain and 
you do not want it too tight.  So one often does observe slight 
flexing/floping of the belt.
