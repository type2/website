Subject: Re: [VB] Brakes revisited

I t WAS strapping material that was also spring steel that he just worked
till it was the same shape as the original; and it worked just like the
original.   I will forward this to Erin also
Rob


&gt; &gt;While adjusting the brake shoes I noticed that a couple of the star
adjuster
&gt; &gt;brakes, the little sheet metal clips that toggle the star, were broke off
or
&gt; &gt;missing. These seem to be attached to the back plate and looked to be
spot
&gt; &gt;welded on. Are there replacement pieces that you can replace them with or
do
&gt; &gt;you have to replace the back plate?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   looong ago, before he got chased off the list, no quarter found some
&gt; spring steel (or was it strapping and baling steel?) that worked
&gt; great. you could rivet it, orput a bolt in... whatever.
