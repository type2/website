&lt;&lt; new product by the Coleman Co. called the &quot;Black Cat&quot;,  advertised as a 
portable propane catalytic type heater which is safe to run in enclosed 
areas.  Price was right at $50.00 and BTUs were something like 3000.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Pink,
This type of heater is only safe in a large structure with plenty of air 
holes to the outside or a small enclosed area if a windo is open.  The 
problem is that even though this type of heater does not produce carbon 
monoxide it still uses up the oxygen to produce carbon dioxide.  Which is why 
RV shops that sell this type of heater system sell at the same time oxygen 
level alarms.  All too often someone has gone to sleep with one of these on, 
never to wake again.  You would be better off to get a gas heater installed.  
Recently a fellow list member found out about a gas heater from Germany for 
semi-trucks that easily converts from desiel to gasoline.  He bought his from 
a semi-truck wrecking yard for $100.00 complete.
