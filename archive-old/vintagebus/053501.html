&lt;&lt; Why do I seem to have two pilot jets and two power fuel systems on my 
Brosol H30/31? Can anyone clue me in as to what is going on here? The thing I 
need to know most urgently is which is my pilot jet and what the is the other 
one?&gt;&gt;

Hi Joel,
You need to get a VW Official Service Manual for at least 1968-71, since it 
sounds like you are running a later engine.  The H30/31 is a Brazilian 
version of the German 1970 only 30 PICT-3, so use the info in the Service 
Manual for the proper tech info for your H30/31.  Of the two pilot jets on 
the right side of the carb the rear one (FIF!) is the true pilot jet and the 
one forward of this is an auxilary air jet.  Remeber the tech info is for use 
with the 1600cc engine with the later bigger 1968-71 air cleaner.  Using this 
carb on a 1600cc with a pre-1968 bus air cleaner it will probably run a bit 
too rich.  You probably will have to go with smaller pilot and main jets and 
a larger air correction to correct this problem.  
  Just a week ago we helped Eric's sister with her first bus a 1969 Canadian 
camper conversion.  The 1600cc engine with a H30/31 on it was running a 125 
main instead of a stock 112.5.  We were out of 112.5s so installed a 115 with 
no apparent loss of HP!  With a 55 pilot instead of the stock 65 it still 
idled well.  She thinks after gas filling yesterday for the first time since 
the carb work that it is using less fuel.  Will be interesting to see after 
four or five tank refills to make sure.

&lt;&lt; Ps. Eric and Barb - Thanks as always, I wish I could give something back. 
I want the jet size gauge / tool too, but what store do I go to to find such 
things? Same as I haven't found the parts yard with the dead busses I 
likewise haven't found the store with the specialized auto tools. For a good 
laugh you should have heard me on the phone trying to find a tool to ream the 
swing-lever bushings. I wasn't a motor-head until I got sucker-punched by a 
cute bus and needed to do what needed to be done. Dumb question as it is to 
most of ya, where do I find such specialized auto tools? &gt;&gt;

Ignorance is bliss huh!!??  ;-)  We got our jet sizing tool through Bow Wow 
Auto Parts (AKA Autovise).  A friend of our's there named Bill had to seach 
for one for three weeks and had to order it twice to get it!  Seems since 
carburetors are old stuff after the last two plus decades of fuel injection 
production cars the tools for them are getting harder to find.
