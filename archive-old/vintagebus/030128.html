Subject: stepped stud and weber carbs

Happy holidays all...
First off...I need a stepped stud for converting an earlier engine to a
doghouse oil cooler... i think its 6mm/8mm?  Would someone have one of
these?  I need one and am having trouble finding one...   Also...I went
to a friends house today and picked up some 34ICH Weber carbs for the
1600 that I'm building.  Complete with hex bar linkage, air cleaners,
and some different joints (not the snap-on kind).  Should I run a header
since I'm running bigger intake?  These will be going onto the 1600 for
my 62 bus thats waiting patiently in the garage...  any comments on
these?
Thanks!  - Isaiah....with a busted &quot;ENTER&quot; key on his keyboard...
