&gt; someone
&gt; doing this!  Am I on glue or are they?

Well, Eastwood is in the business of selling coating products, so the
more things that they can convince you to coat the more products they
can sell.

Future installments:

Powdercoating your torsion bars
Powdercoating your brake shoes
Powdercoating your wheel bearings
Powdercoating your crankshaft

and many more...
