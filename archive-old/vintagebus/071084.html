Subject: 67 deluxe fs in NC

Howdy Volks,

I am selling my daily driver in Greensboro, NC.  It is a 67 Deluxe
Walk-Through.  Below is a link to the ad on TheSamba.  I'm posting here
because I don't always look at the classifieds, but I always read this list.
I know how hard it was for me to find one this nice around these parts (took
me about 3 years).  I no longer have the luxury of attending to the
restoration.  Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Sean
