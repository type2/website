Subject: Re: [VB] Ebay item,thermos for  bus lunchbox

Link doesn't work.  Try this link:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=327915152&amp;r=0&amp;
t=0




&gt;Since it's Friday and people seem to think it's ok to post ebay crap.Here's
&gt;another
&gt;item people might be looking for.The thermos (only) for the bus lunchbox.
&gt;http://cqi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cqi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=327915152
&gt;I hope I have this link right. If not the # is 327915152
