&lt;&lt; I have a 'normal' rear seat to which I want to attach
 the aluminium luggage bar.  Do seats that originally
 came with the bar have some extra metal brackets
 or tabs on the frame that the bar attaches too?
 (I suspect they do but maybe not?) &gt;&gt;

YES. they are tabs with two threaded holes. 3, welded to the frame. I can get 
a pic if you need one.
