Subject: RE: [VB] Cleaning headlining

Cif is Jif.  I'm in the UK and its just changed its name to Cif - I am sure
I saw it in the US though.  Simple Green - what sort of product is that?

Cheers
Paul

simple green is good.   I have used a light bleach solution ( separately
from 
sg) to get out mold, but I am afraid that may make the headliner brittle. 

 Glycerin does restore suppleness to the realvinyl leatherette used for 
headliners and seat upholstery.

cif?

&lt;&lt; Hello,
 
 Any ideas on how to clean a pin hole headlining?  A friend has just bought
a
 66 bus and the headlining is still tight, but has yellowish stains in
 places.  We tried cleaning it with CIF but that didn't touch it
 unfortunately. 
 
 Cheers
