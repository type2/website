Well,

pull DP#2 out of foo-neck-(betty), and am getting ready to install DP#1.  It's
the cycle, one out-rehabilitate,install, repeat....

Anywaze, one of my axle boots wuz split.  Check the miriad of literature I
have- turns out the split-type boots should be installed with the split seam
horizontal and facing the rear.  (Not upright as I had them) Prolly the reason
why I only got about 3 years out of the old boot...

Question on the clutch.  The pins that hold the through-out bearing is scoured
and continues in an arch up on the thrust mechanism itself.  Although I didn't
measure the circumference of the scour - it prolly matches up with the spring
teeth of the newer-style pressure plate.  Me guesses I need to use the old
style, with the three pressure points.  Am I right.  This fits a newer 1600?

-later

christian
