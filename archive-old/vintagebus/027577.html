I agree w/Veewee111 about moors that have sat for ages.   When I got my 53, 
it has sat for probably 30 years by the tags, the owner who had parked it had 
died, and it had gone to someone else who I bougt it from.   Anyhow, the 
muffler was rusted to bits etc, and I was convinced to tear it down and 
rebuild.   Took a while to find new std/std/36hp main and rod bearings.   
anyway, they was an inch of sludge in the bottom of the case ick-   and god 
knows what in the oil passages- glad I had the case all cleaned out.     My 
first complete rebuild- I took some timewith it- it had (nice clean) pieces 
all over the living room for a while. runs good now.

&lt;&lt; The original owner of this bus died in '59 and the bus sat in a dirt

chattering/high pitched rattle) that I did NOT have before that last drive 
when I got her pretty overheated.&gt;&gt;

If the engine was not properly prepared by the owner for storage before he 
died and if iut was not kept up during the storage the engine is suspect and 
should be dissassembled and inspected.  When we bought our 1963 SC back in 
1986 it had sat for eight years just after having a complete engine rebuild.  
One of the long 40HP early rocker studs had pulled out of one of the heads 
causing a HP loss that the owner just gave up and parked it.  Once I got the 
engine running it ate it's bearings about 50 miles later due to the rust on 
the crank.  The oil in it during the eight years sitting was dirty, acidic, 
and had water in it!
