First thought,  Wrong list.
Second thought, Adapters
Third thought, redrill hubs
Fourth thought, How much high performance can you have with four wheel drum
brakes?
Fifth thought, convert to later front and rear end. ie the other list.
Sixth thought, Isn't &quot;high performance&quot; and &quot;bus&quot; in the same sentence an oxy
moron?

Sorry for the sarcasm, just thought it was a funny subject.
