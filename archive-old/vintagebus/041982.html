&gt; Works great for those vinyl bumperstickers that 
&gt; have been on there for a decade, stretching vinyl
&gt; upholstery, drying paint, etc.  It even includes
&gt; the amazing adjustomatic heat controlling option!
&gt; Just hold it far or near, depending on need.

These are also good &quot;pre heaters&quot; for defrosting your bus in the morning.
I use a &quot;popcorn pumper&quot; model with the top deflector removed.  It puts
out about 1500W of heat and the fan circulates the air nicely.
