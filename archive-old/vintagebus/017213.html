Subject: High oil temp = leak?
Date: Sat, 29 Jul 2000 23:58:58 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I finally got some hydrolic hoses to fix my oil leak when I removed the old 
ones I found the problem. ONe hose had bubbled up between the layers of 
rubber near the metal end. This bubble had a pin hole in it that was causing 
the trouble.

My question  is: My oil temp has seemed excessively high lately. Could high 
temp have caused my bubble? My temp has been running about 250F even at 
night on the highway.  It used to run about 230F. Could the fan have pulled 
something in that is blocking my oil cooler. I've checked the thermostat 
before and it seems to be working ok. If I suspect something blocking the 
cooler is there some EASY way of cleaning it out?

Scott
