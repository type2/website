Subject: WANTED:  Wedding Bus in MA

Hello!  I will be getting married in October of this year, and I would
love to have a bus in my wedding.  My 71 bus won't be ready by then (too
much time spent getting ready for the wedding!).

Does anyone know of busses (up to 72) that are available to participate
in my wedding?  The wedding is in Springfield, MA, USA.  I would want to
transport at least my fiance and myself from the Ceremony to the
Reception, but possibly some or all of the wedding party too.

Also, the bus(es) would be participating in our photo session (and would
be THE photo session if it was up to me....).  I am sure I could provide
a few professional photographs to the participants (of their bus, not of
me).

I am still working on the details, so any information that you can
provide would be great.

Thanks!

John Chapdelaine, 71 bus
