Subject: Re: accel. cable cut tranny case

&gt;i notice when i pulled my engine that my accelerator cable is slowly slicing
&gt;through the tranny case. [...] i was thinking of sliding some fuel line over
&gt;it, but i dont know it that will jam up or maybe not last very long.

As long as the fuel line can't slide back and forth it shouldn't jam up.
On my Bus, I didn't have the metal tube that runs through the fan housing
secured very well and my throttle would occasionally jam; I am convinced
it was because this tube was sliding around.  Once I fixed it in place
the throttle quit jamming.

The simplest way to do this is probably to use a long enough fuel line
that you can fit it over the body tube at the front and the through-the-
shroud tube at the rear.  Put a little grease on the cable as you put
it in the fuel line.
