Subject: Last Chance Midwest Campouts

Last Chance to get in some camping for this season!!  Both of these
campouts are really good.  Fall colors this year should be spectacular.
The weather may get cool at night and maybe even during the day, so come
prepared (we could even see a sprinkle or two).

There is nothing like a fall campout, so join us!!

Beautiful tall oak tree campground with a caravan to the historic German
town of Herman MO.
Lots of great shopping in small speciality shops along with great German
food.  Everyone welcome.

October 26&amp;27 -
Bustoberfest, Indian Cave State Park, Neb,

Wonderful historic campground with fall activities.  Beautiful fall colors
on the trees.  Evenings can get cool this time of year.   Plenty of fun for
the entire family.  Activities include:  haunted hay rack rides, craft
demonstrations, historic town tours. Everyone welcome, no matter what you
drive.
