Hello Volks,

It's been raining all day at work, so I did some inside work and a
little bit of exploring... I found the treasure chest in a box kept in a
loft above the showroom... All kinds of neat stuff. One of the things I
found of interest was a small, heavy black distributer with a Bosch
emblem riveted onto it. The numbers were 231 (can't remember the middle
3 digits) 010. Is this the famed &quot;010&quot; dizzy I've heard about? I thought
the 010 was a vac/centrifugal advance. This one looked strictly
centrifugal. Maybe I'm not reading the numbers right... What's so
special about the 010, anyway? The curve?
