There is a guy driving around Johannesburg with a mid sixties Kombi that has
had a late bay beam installed as is. He welded up the unused holes for
roadworthy certification purposes and had a new shift rod made up by an
engineering firm.

The rear end is from a late model bay with the necessary carriers welded
onto the splitties frame. It is powered by the antiquated Ford 3l V6 (Essex)
engine which is still manufactured here - it is a favourite of the kit car
crowd.

The radiator installation is the freakiest part of the job. There are two
radiators which have been installed on either side of the nose crease. They
are in boxes which intrude into the foot space on either side of where the
heater pipe would be. On the outside of the nose he has put together a
handmade stainless steel flush mounted radiator cowl which looks almost as
though it came off a Willys Opera coupe. Very well made and all that.

It was all very well built and the body was beatifully done, even the weird
radiator thing looked like it could have been built that way. It just wasn't
a split bus anymore and it gave me a Frankensteinish feeling.

He said that it went like a train and stopped real good but that at speeds
over 140kph(I think that is about 80mph) it would start to lose contact with
the ground.

Before seeing this car I wanted to go hog wild on my dcab, it changed my
mind and if I decide I need a high speed spacious cruiser I will get one of
the Audi powered 2.6L Vanagons that they still make here. 

My opinion for what it's worth.

Later 

Michael
