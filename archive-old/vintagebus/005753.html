I used nuts and bolts and threadlocker goo.  Get a smallish bolt with the
flat Phillips countersunk head.  You'll have to grind the excess off of the
drum side so the heads of the bolts don't interfere with positive drum to
rim contact, but otherwise, it's easy, you can make it really tight, replace
bad clips in the future with ease, etc.  If you want, I'll send pics...

&gt; OK, I just spent an hour trying put hub cap retaining clips on one wheel,
how in the H#LL do you do this (1970 &amp; earlier 5 lug wide pattern wheels)??
I was trying to pound the little rivot flat on the back that holds the clip
and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  Anybody have any tips they'd
like to share???
