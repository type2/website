Oh great...another hippy bus.  :-(  I spent a lot of
money to have hippy graphics removed from mine.  I
hate it when a nice bus is ruined by hippies, even if
it is a huge multinational company that does it.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt;     If some of you remember a few years back,
&gt; Discover Card purchased two
&gt; low mileage buses and had them painted by the Jerry
&gt; Garcia Foundation to
&gt; then be given away via a sweepstake.Well, I received
&gt; a call the other day
&gt; from a friend telling me they were for sale locally,
&gt; so I dropped everything
&gt; I was doing and went and had  a look at them.Well, I
&gt; bought them on the
&gt; spot.
&gt;     One is a 59 microbus with 22,000 original
&gt; miles(still has the 40 horse
&gt; bastard motor)
&gt; and the other is a 65 21 window with 62,000 original
&gt; miles.Both have  WILD
&gt; graphic paint jobs from bumper to bumper  and are
&gt; &quot;signed&quot; by Jerry.
&gt;     The reason I'm posting this to the list is, I'm
&gt; trying to find out the
&gt; origins of the 65 deluxe.I know the 59 came out of
&gt; Pennsylvania and was
&gt; mango green and sea gull grey and many people were
&gt; disappointed that
&gt; Discover took such an original, cheery bus to use
&gt; for the graphic paint
&gt; job.The 65, I was told, was once owned by Jerry
&gt; Garcia.But I'm unsure of
&gt; this. Does anyone out there know who owned this bus
&gt; before Discover card
&gt; bought it ?? There is a Missouri Vehicle sticker on
&gt; the Drivers windshield.
&gt; I would appreciate any info. !
&gt; I'll have pics up soon.
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS,
&gt; 
&gt;
