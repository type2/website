I don't have any production #'s , but it would be low.  I only know of a
handful of RHD  BD deluxes, and a couple kombis.

Got pix?

&gt;Does anyone know how many RHD Barndoor Panels were produced??
&gt;Thom?? Everett??
&gt;I'm thinking it was pretty low making them, dare I say, *RARE*
&gt;My reason for asking is simple I've found one (no where near
&gt;here) and am having difficulties swallowing the price (I'm cheap
&gt;anyway) But I want a long term project that will keep my
&gt;attention longer than a few months and I think this is it.
