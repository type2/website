Subject: Speedo gels and needle de-gaussing

Thanks to Ben, I now have a nice supply of colored gels for my (2) speedos
(and more when I get 'em).  I installed new gels in the unit that was
already apart....I hope I don't make anybody mad.....I have beautiful green
for the turn signal, rich red for generator, alarming green for oil pressure
(idiot!), and purple (purple!?) for the high beam indicator.  (I backed up
the blue with a bit of that red stuff you buy when some bozo smashes your
taillight....)  Hey, it looks really good!

In the new VW trends (Hi Thom's panel!) there is an article about speedo
restoration, and in it was mention of do-it-yourselfers messing up the
calibration of the speedo by de-gaussing the speedo needle?  Anybody know of
this?  I only had it apart enough to install new gels (and let moisture in,
dammit).  Do you think I messed it up?

Anyway, thanks, and Thanks again Ben!

Gene
