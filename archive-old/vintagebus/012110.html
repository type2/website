Subject: re: horn
Mime-Version: 1.0

I had previous written regarding trouble with my horn. I had ordered one from Wolfsburg West. (6v) The horn didn't have the correct clips for the boot horn wires.  I was a bit puzzled, and I went back to check the catalog, and sure enough in the picture of the horn they claim to be selling, the clips are there.  

When I called regarding this, they told me that they send out whatever they have, and I was welcome to return it for a refund. They expect me to pay for shipping. The salesman suggested it was just a cosmetic difference, HELLO, but what about protecting the wires and connection from corroding? He then said just use some sealant between the horn and the connecting wires. Damn, if I wanted to do that I would have just gotten any horn at my FLAPS. They expect me to pay for shipping!

It probably is only a couple of bucks, but it is the principle. What I mean to say is they showed a picture of one thing, and sold and shipped me another, and therefore I need to pay some money, waste some of my time making extra phone calls, and a trip to the post office, and writing cranky letters to the list.

Is it too much for me to expect them to pick up the shipping?

Is it very smart of them not to, as I have thrown them quite a bit of money, and now no longer plan on doing business with them.

I hjave since ordered the part from the Bus Depot, Ron assured me it was a NOS Horn. I'll let you know if I get the right one.
