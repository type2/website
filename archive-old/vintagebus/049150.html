Somebody please pinch me.  This has to be a dream.  The '59 Westfalia is actually home in the garage??!!!!

Yes sirree bob.  14 months and 2 weeks in the body/paint shop.  That's the only info regarding the body/paint shop I'll ever disclose.  The total price tag outta the shop is information that only I will ever know.  Like I said, it's the '59 FKR (Fort Knox Resto).

Aside from minor details like the cost, it looks great.  A few little boo-boo's that they're going to take care of later.  I armed myself with my digital camera only to discover that the photo cartridge was at home.  Doh!!!!  Luckily my buddy Joe Crockett was there packin' his video camera so he got it on film.

I'll be snappin' some first stage photos this weekend and get them posted somewhere on Monday.  Now the real fun begins.  Realistically (don't forget, I have 2 small kids) I'm shooting for Kelly Park 2001 to debut, but maybe I'll get lucky and things will fall into place for BBB in January.

It sure feels nice to have a freshly painted bus at the house again, running or not.

Robert
