Subject: [VB] nightmare steering problem

Be aware that I have seen buses that were on the road driving that when
inspected had frames cracked around the steering box area. SERIOUSLY. The
steering box will/may hide these cracks.

If the bus has ever had even minor frontend collision then it is [in my own
personal opinion] possible that the frame may be cracked in that area.

I did not say there will be cracks. I said that it might have cracks in that
area.

Anyone tearing down a bus for frontend work and/or restoration project should
carefully double check this area. Dont assume that it's all good.

Cannot say what the problem is in the bus as described in this topic's original
post. Definite need for inspection.
