&gt; Hi Woody,
&gt; We have had that happen twice in our 63 SC and next time we take it apart
&gt; will probably add a zerk fitting there.  Interestingly there is a stock
zerk
&gt; fitting to grease this area in our 1960 panel conversion and apparently
was
&gt; discontinued about 61.  Eric&amp;Barb

I was thinking of doing just that, but there is a frame member
under the pivot pin which gets in the way.I thought of drilling the frame
but decided not to.My 60 Westy has a zerk fitting also and the
 frame is not in the way.I wonder when Vw. changed there design ?
