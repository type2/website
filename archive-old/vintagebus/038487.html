Subject: Redux box repair ?s

I have observed a wobling of the left rear wheel on the '67 as well as a
minor leak in the redux box on that side. It was my intention to remove the
entire transaxle for my first ever redux box work. It is a bit messy in the
area of the transaxle becuase of bad boots and I thought it would be easier
to clean up the mess with the tranny out because my timeline is getting
shorter. I am no leaning towards rebuilding the left RBG in situ. I have
consulted the Bentley and this seem to be an acceptable practice.

Again this is my first time doing this job and the number of VW related
tools and local mfg. tools refered to in the Bentley are making me a bit
nervous. Until I get the RGB apart I will not know how many of the bearings
might be bad.

 Is it possible that the wobbley stub axle is not the result of a bad
bearing( hoping for lower outer only:)?

Can I get by with garden variety off the shelf pullers to get the bearings
off?

I am finding Brazilian and &quot;German &quot; bearing available. What to do?

Does anyone seal a complete kit with all the seals and bearings?

What should I expect the springplate to do when I remove the redux box?

Any caveats of advice would be greatly appreciated.
