I've found the best way to diagnose this is to have a friend 
sit in the cab and slowly wiggle the wheel back and forth,
while you lay underneath and watch all the parts move, and look
for slop in any of the components. 

Have them move it back and forth just past the free-play point,
which to me is the most effective way to see what's loose.
