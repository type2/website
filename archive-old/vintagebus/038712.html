    Well, here we are at the old dilemma.

    Our 65 Standard with pop-top was hit in the right rear quarter,
suffering considerable damage to sheet metal, wheel well and general shape
in the rear. The estimate on repair from a reputable local shop we trust
implicitly is in the neighborhood of $4,000. This would return the Tamale to
the shape it was in before the accident, that is with some miner dings and
needing a new paint job, interior finishing and general cosmetic repair.

    Seeking opinions on repair or not repair. I hate like hell to sacrifice
another body to the choppers, but then other bodies would live again.

    Any of you aware of ca. 65 campers in the Southwest available right now?

    Michael
