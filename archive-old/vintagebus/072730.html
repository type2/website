Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance -Good luck

I had a similar conversation with AAA when I was getting
full coverage for my '55 westy.  They looked it up in their
&quot;Gold Book&quot; and had a valuation for a '55 deluxe in showroom
condition _at_ $1500

I challened them to find *any* 1955 car - hell, even a moped -
in showroom condition for $1500

Remember, an insurance company's ultimate goal is to collect
as much in premiums as they can get away with, and pay out as
little as they can in claims.  That's what they do.
