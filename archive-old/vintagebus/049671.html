Subject: TX listees - looking for 59 kombi
Message-Id: &lt;v02130507b3620f1c917a_at_[208.240.161.25]&gt;

I've decided on a pointless quest this summer - retrieving the kombi i sold
a few years back when hard up for cash... anyone in Texas who knows where
it is, I'd appreciate a buzz.

Bus was previously painted US flag-style, starsNstripes. Had punkrock
'Clash77' stuff painted on rear bulkhead, to cover up the hippie poetry
previously there (best part about the bus was this culture clash!!)
No, I don't have the chassis #, don't recall it even having plates.
Purchased from a scooter guy named Eric; title had  Sarah somebody on it;
lost the info.
Sold it to a guy named Chad - never  learned his last name (hey, last names
are for losers!!). Got a horrid paintbrush job from Disney to be in some
movie. Think it is now light blue or white.
Subsequently sold; no-one can find Chad or remember who he sold it to.
Bus was in decent shape, considering the age, and the fact that speed freak
punkers had it for a few years.

Told you this was pointless quest!  I don't really expect much results, but
a running, fairtamiddling 59 is enough of a rarity in Texas that mebbee
I'll get lucky.
I'd at least like to see how she looks - I was very sad to see her go.
