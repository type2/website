&lt;&lt; First question: what the hell are y'all talking about when you say 'big
 nuts' ? I mean on the bus ( or, in my case, truck) I thought it was the axle
 nuts, but mine are the same size as the Ghia, real close to 11/2 &quot;
 You ain't talkin' about the driver, are you?

:)   Talking about the rear axle nuts.  The Reduction gears with the 36mm 
rear axle nut are 1.39.   The reduction for the big nuts- 46mm is 1.26.   
THis is true at least 99% of the time, but I think the 216 '63 RGs with the 
36mm nut but the 64-67 width brakes have 1.26 reduction, and there are a tiny 
amount of mountain geared buses, 
............
sounds like you have 36mm (small) nuts, which is the 1.39 reduction ratio
 -----------
 Next, I had  the trans geared to 3:88. With the reduction boxes, what does
 that make the final drive? 15&quot; wheels on the 63 double  cab.
                     thanks, bigdog
  &gt;&gt;

well, check out the post that Dave Easterwood did, you have 3.88 r&amp;p, and 
1.39 RGear , and whatever size wheels.   THink that says 62.5 mph at 3500rpms 
for your set up.    That list is nice, about the best I have seen, but you 
should get a tach and find where you have 2K , 2500,  3K, 3500 rpms in your 
bus in each gear, (well just 3K for 1st).   Just cause I have seen things 
where the math does not jive.  You can borrow one for testing, and return it, 
you don't have to install it. Write the numbers down.  my personal experience 
is that 3K is optimum cruising engine speed.   It runs cooler there than at 
3500, and better gas milage, and sounds sweeter.  some people like to drive 
with higher rpms than I do.  But get a tach to get the real skinny on YOUR 
rig.
