Forgot to mention this bus is in Augusta GA and I am asking $1600 for it.
Thanks again!

&gt; I think I may have finally found a double cab so I want to start
advertising
&gt; my 67 Westy now.
&gt;
&gt; 1967 Westy. EXCELLENT body. Let me repeat EXCELLENT body. Currently mostly
&gt; in primer. Has a new cargo lip installed. Later model 67 with reverse
lights
&gt; and dual circuit. Bus is currently up on jackstands with chassis tore
apart.
&gt; I have all the new brakes lines hoses, mc etc...for it. It still needs a
new
&gt; drag link and shocks. Also needs swing axle boots, new redux seals, and
&gt; engine and then chassis will be complete. (aside from tires). Body needs
&gt; minor, minor work. Some SLIGHT surface rust has started to appear that
will
&gt; need knocked off, and then paint. I do not, unfortunately, have the
&gt; interior. I have the one seat and the water tank and that is it. I do
&gt; however, know where a 67 westy parts bus is located with complete interior
&gt; and even roof rack. This would make an excellent project for someone
&gt; especially if they would like one partially done to finish in time for the
&gt; summer. I may accept partial trade, maybe full trade if the deal is right,
&gt; but I would prefer cash to help finance my double cab(I haven't talked to
&gt; the guy yet, but I have my hopes up). Thanks for reading and please pass
on
&gt; to anyone you know that might want a nice bus. Happy new year all and
happy
&gt; dubbin!
