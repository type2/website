Hi All,
After letting the 62 sit for a couple weeks,
I thought I'd better fire it up and take her around the
block a few times. It's got a fairly new battery (3 mos), but
it was deader than a doornail. I figured out that I had
left the radio on the last time I drove it, so It's been 
suckin juice for about 2 weeks. Now it doesn't want to
take a charge (6v _at_ 6amp). Is this battery toast??
Can it be serviced?? Or should I take it back and play 
dumb? BTW does everyone else's radio stay on when 
the key is off? Never had a VW with a radio that worked
so I'm not sure if it is wired right.
Thanks,
Larry   62 Westy Flip
