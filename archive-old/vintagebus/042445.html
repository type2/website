hi there,

i have a 67 beam in my 61...

looking at the (damaged) beam i took out, the drums are narrower, the
spindles shorter and wider.  The linkpins are also completely different
and are NLA new, so if you ever need to replace em they are $150 for
rebuilt from wolfgang VS 45.00 new for 64+ from anywhere.

Dunno if you could mix and match, but i'd say that youd have a much easier
time just finding a complete 64+beam, when people have extras they are so
big to store they can usually be had cheap/free. The hardest part of the
r&amp;r is undoing the usually frozen shift rod coupler, though new ones are
available for about $6 or so if you bugger yours beyond serviceability.

my $0.02...

peas,

Steve
