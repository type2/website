Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Alternator swap

Yes, I would agree.  Replacement Motorola Regulators I have sold over the
years have had wire colors that were not consistent.  My diagram was taken
from the Motorola installation on my 73 Ghia, which I know for a fact was
original when new.  I suppose the main thing is to be sure the connection to
the Alternator is consistent to the plug arrangement I show in my PDF.

I also agree, that most would be better off upgrading to the AL82 with the
built-in regulator, that way there's almost no wiring mistakes to be made.

Thanks

&gt;  hey Jim  I have 2 of the motrola regulators in my hand one is wired like
&gt; your diagrams brown, blue, green, red   the other has brown , red, gray,
&gt; white.   Connectors are the same aND THEY LOOK THE SAME EXCEPT FOR WIRE
&gt; COLORS.    Comparing the connectors show that the gray matches the blue and
&gt; white matches the green   kinda strange   later  mark dearing
