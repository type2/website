Brother Steve had this wild notion that he could make New Mexico by Monday
but...then the bus wouldn't start again. Finally ended up replacing the
wire from the starter solenoid to the double relay. We THINK that got it.

Fuel-injection people write that in your notebooks.

Tomorrow he says we have to fix some noise in the brakes or something.

We love having him here but he wants to go places that are even hotter than
this. Peculiar lad. He is actively avoiding the net.

He can eat a lot of fish, we surmise, and he tolerates children well, which
around here is pretty much all it takes to become a hero.
