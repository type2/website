Forgot to list one that Mr. ($10000.00) Heard  should have given out.
The long distance driven in a barndoor bus: To Everret Barnes who
drove his 55 from Phoenix Az. to Long Beach. Thats about 450 miles each
way. If Heard wont come up with a trophy we'll give you one when you
drive the 55 to Lake Havasu in Jan. 99.
