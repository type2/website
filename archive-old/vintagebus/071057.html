Subject: Re: [VB] I finally did it... I bought one. Digging in.

Bart, Susan &amp; Volk-A-Maniacs,

Thanks for the clarification of the bus being a Sundial.  And... yep, the
other windows are in the bus cubby hole under one of the seats.  They are
awaiting a good afternoon to be swapped back in place.  The interior could
use a good going over, but I have more pressing issues now.

We are still struggling with the engine.  A lot of sputter, backfire and not
a very clean idle (if I can get it to idle that is).  It ran well for a 50
mile trip to the in-laws house Saturday morning, and ran ok on the way back
on Saturday night.  Going to and from work (less than a mile) was ok
yesterday with some small backfire and rough driving (contributed it to a
cold engine at the time).  But this morning, I gave it a good 5 minute warm
up idle and then didn't even get a block before I turned around and parked
it.  This afternoon we combed through everything again and found one loose
sparkplug and the others were nasty black already (new plugs and wires from
last Thursday).  We cleaned all that up again and it still doesn't give me
that purr we all like to hear.  Given some more time, we will figure it out,
but for the time being, she is bound to the garage.

Regarding M-Codes... Here is what I gathered from the metal plate in the
engine compartment...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   VOLKSWAGENWERK  AG
   MADE IN GERMANY
   Typ 21    Farest. - Nr. 1121512
   Heizg Typ2/255A      Pruiz.~545
   zul Gesamtgeur.kg      Baujahr
   zul Adaslast vorn kg   hinten Kg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The same number (1121512) is pressed into the sheet metal to the right
(passenger side) of the engine.  Between the engine and the battery tray.
There is no plate on the passenger side of the air vent in the cab.  Not
sure if there should be one there or not.

Also, the motor has a number on it as well.  I know it's not original, but
would like to track down info on that as well.  H5009205 is the number.

If you know where to find more information given the details above, please
let me know where.  I'm interested in as much history on the bus as
possible.  The prior owner said it was 'born' in May.  Not sure I trust much
of anything that kid said at this point.

Thanks again for the info and let me know if you have any more to offer.
Greg
