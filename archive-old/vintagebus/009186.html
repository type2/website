&gt;  Do not use GL-5!  When offered to you by knowledgable FLAPS
&gt; employs make sure to mention that you are just too attached to your brass
&gt; syncros to allow the high phospherous content of the GL-4 to corrode them.
&gt; ;-)  Eric&amp;Barb

I believe the problem is GL 5 has a high sulfur and phospor content and is
very acidic. Sulfur and phosphate reactions start at a lower temperature and
is corrosive to copper bearings and BRONZE synchro rings.
