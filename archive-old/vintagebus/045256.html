In a message dated 98-08-04 02:01:00 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Remove mirror. &gt;&gt;
Why?  If it can be used to remove some of the danger of hitting some idiot who
decides to pass you on the right.  While you are trying move to the right lane
by reducing your blind spot there from having cargo or the tarp on thusly
blocking the rear window or just to get better visibility in your panel.  Does
it not make sense to use this and keep one more panel bus or truck from
getting wrecked?    Eric &amp; Barb
