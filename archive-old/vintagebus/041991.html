&gt; While i did have the motor running i did notice that my generator light
&gt; never went off.  That means either generator, regulator or wiring.

Since youve been in the wiring I will think you should check all of that 
first to be sure it is not the cause...

This can be caused by stuck (arced, burned) together contacts in the
regulator. Ive messed with these before and any attempt at repair is false
economy. If its the regulator replace it.
