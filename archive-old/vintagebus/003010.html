&gt;the second order is in the works , so if there is something you
&gt;shippment! if you have das bullis catalogue this is from the same supplier
&gt;mine will be up soon (catalogue)


Does anyone have Das Bulli's web page with the diagrams on it?  I could use
some pieces of metal around my cargo doors and along the bottom sides of my
66.  I'd try to get a catalog but I'm not sure how much time I have to get
one before the next order goes out.
