Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals

HI Rich,
I have the same problems with my window area, What I
did was cleaned it (wire wheel). Primered the area,
then applied duct tape, got a tube of roofing tar &amp;
put that over every thing, next thing to do is get the
glass ready to go in, then apply another layer of tar
&amp; install. its been over a year &amp; no sign of leaks,
thats saying alot from a bus in the PNW. granted not
the best fix for long term solutions, but its worked
for me.

as for cleaning up the mess, wd40.
