&lt;&lt; None of these seems to be a problem.  Oil temp.  stabilizes at 180F.  Any

Hi Chet,
Have you taken a good look at your relief valve/s and thier spring/s?  Also 
check that your oil pick up tube at the sump is not loose.  If it is it will 
wobble the hole in the case to the point that it sucks in more air than oil.
