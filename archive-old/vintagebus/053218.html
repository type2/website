This has been some concern to me as well. Does a shifter lock lock the
shifter only in neutral?

Somebody needs to invent an e-brake club for the bus, but then a good
thief would just cut the e-brake cable, but it would discourage the less
knowledgeable thief.

Ronnie

at least I won't have to worry about somebody stealing the fugly bus!

Is it just my imagination or has there been an dramatic increase of
thefts going on in my neck of the woods(Orange Co.)??

The camo DC, the white bug at OCTO, and one or two others are just
recent examples.  Then, last night I opened the garage late to put the
truck in and was greated with a truck door slaming and a newer blue Ford
crewcab speeding away.  Sure, could have been a neigbhor, but I asked
and they wern't expecting anyone.

Since I'm having to drive my truck on a daily basis till my water pumper
gets back, I'm going to start being more careful.  Till I get a gas
shutoff at the tank, I'm using my low tech pull the rotor, and a few
fuses technique, any other ideas?  I guess I really need to spend the
bucks on a locking shifter.  Should I spend the money on a Berg, or will
one of the
less costly bug ones work?   How about that brake &quot;club&quot; like device
thats
all over infomercial hell?  Anyone tried one on the verticle pedels of
our busses??
