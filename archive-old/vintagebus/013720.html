I did the same thing when I was trying to get my radio working. I bought a $20
speaker from radio Shack that fit the plate.  I went out and hooked it up to
the radio.  It sounded awful.  Just for grins I hooked up the original, and it
sounded better!  Pretty sad considering the original paper was completely torn
and only about a 1/3 of it was even there.  I walked back in Radio Slack and
returned the speaker.  The ratty original one has been in my bus ever since. 
Never have gotten around to replacing it but I don't listen to the radio much
anymore anyway.  I do need to find an original one for my resto though. 
Anyone know of one?

Thanks,
Richard

my new speaker sounds about the same as the original torn one, although the
bass sounds much better when played at a volume that can be heard when the bus
is running. How can you not listen to it, i love listening to the christian
preachers telling me how evil everyon in the world is
