Hi all-

For those in the San Diego area (or nearby), there is a car show sponsored
by Coronado Mainstreet on April 18th.  It is held in conjunction with the
annual Coronado Flower Show, and usually draws a pretty good crowd.
Unfortunately, I don't think I have ever seen any busses on display in
previous years.

To rectify that problem, I am planning on entering my 21 window, and
wondered if there might be some other volks in the area that would be
interested in entering.  It would be cool to have a few busses parked
together in the &quot;corral&quot;.

Pmail me if interested, and I'll see that you get an entry form.  The cost
is $10, which includes a dash plaque (which is evidently important to the
hot rod types), and a T-shirt to commemorate the event.

Dave
67 21 window
Coronado, CA

P.S. Please don't enter if your bus is really nice, I don't want to look bad!
