Hi Volks,
Could be the distributor drive and the gear on the bottom of the distributor 
are just barely touching due to incorrect shimming of the distributor drive 
gear.  When accelerating and higher RPMs this connection will slip.  Also it 
could be your air correction jets are way too big allowing too lean of 
mixture at higher RPMs.
