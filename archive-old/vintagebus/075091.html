Subject: RE: [VB] friday question - coffee names

how bout Mayes Dazzed, a very strong dark ethiopian roast. Dazzed because of
the look everyone gets looking for those tiny nuts and bolts for David and a
Dark roast because his DC has gone to the dark side, because of all the
chrome and modifications and strong blend because you have to be strong at
heart to continue the anal search for the correct parts for a bus from the
dark side

ronnie  just a thought and a good story to go behind the name!!!!

Subject: [VB] friday question - coffee names


Some of you may or may not know that I am in the process of converting my 58
panel into a mobile espresso van.  It will make it's debut at the Volksfest
in
Naches, WA September 13th.  What I need from the list is this, I need 4
names
for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW related, they do not
have
to be all bus related.  The 4 lucky winners will each get a pound of fresh
roasted coffee with their blend name.  Thanks all, come see me at Volksfest
in
September!!!!
