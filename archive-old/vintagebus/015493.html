HI All,

Just a quick note to let you know that I posted
a little update on the restoration of my US 23 window
deluxe.

The front end is in, the bus is back on its wheels (for
the first time in 18 months) and the cargo floor (made
from my patch panels) is back in.

Go to the link below and click on the 'update page'
link in the left frame for pix.

night all

RobK
