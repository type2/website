this seller calls his bus &quot;slightly custom&quot;! HaHaHaHaHa! thought you all 
would find this amusing. and i like how the airbags make it &quot;better than 
stock!&quot; :-)

living in the midwest, i dont see many busses at all, let alone custom jobs 
like this. but i see so many customs for sale (bugs and busses) for HUGE 
DOLLARS. and it appears they DON'T sell. i dont understand why people pour 
money into dubs like this and think they are going to get twenty thousand 
dollars for them?!?! like that red chop top vert Beetle that was on thesamba 
for ~$15k!


oh well,
