Hi Thom,
We say that if you want to go ahead and install late model type 2 section in 
your webpages to do so!  They are a group of VW owners whom in the coming 
years will soon vastly outnumber us pre-1968 owners and we will have to rely 
on thier wants and needs to help keep the new mechanical parts that we run in 
our earlier VWs and keep them on the road.
