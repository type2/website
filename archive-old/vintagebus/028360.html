Here's what I used for sound proofing in my '67 Westy... Keeping in mind
that these things are insulated to the hilt anyway. Put 3- 3M asphalt sound
proofing squares in each of the front doors. The result is the doors shut
with a solid Porsche thud now instead of the VW twaannng.... Four of the
same 3M squares in the nose to replace the 1/4 inch styrofoam.

1/8&quot; felt under the wood floorboard stuck onto the plywood with half dry
varathane and sealed with silicone on the aluminum trim piece along the side
door so no  moisture gets in... Big difference here!

 1/2&quot; felt cut to fit behind the rear seat bed and glued with the exception
of the bottom floor piece so I can get the bed in and out with less hassle.
Underneath the rear cushion another 1/2&quot; felt square cut which is not glued
eitherform back of the seat to rear hatch. Non-glued pieces of 1/2&quot; felt in
the side wardrobe and closet as well.

Overall result... low cost, low tech  and extremely quiet!!! Installed a
tach to see what the engine was up to back there...

&gt; &gt; DO not waste your money of that stuff (B-Quiet) I tried it on one of my
&gt; other
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  cars... It went on easy enough, a lot easier than Dynamat, BUT when it
got
&gt; &gt;  hot outside (summer) the adhesive started to melt and it would slide
&gt; around
&gt; &gt;  or down AND it bled through the vinyl backing and it's nasty when that
&gt; &gt;  happens (stains your hands and whatever clothing/interior that touches.
&gt; Just
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  spend the extra $$ on Dynamat ( I know I will when I have a bus with an
&gt; &gt;  interior) It really doesn't cost that much more.
&gt; &gt;  Thanks,

&gt; Thanks for the info, I guess that I will use Dynamat, it seems to be the
best
&gt; and when you invest your time, the $$$ saved can all be wasted if it does
not
&gt; work as you want.
