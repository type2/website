I would suspect the brake pedal return spring is broken.  THough it is 
possible to drive like this by lifting up the pedal with your toe after 
braking, it is loads nicer to have a working spring.
You have to remove the pedal that goes through the floor underneath the 
floor, , and undo some other bits that I can't remeber right now.   grease 
the moving parts well before reassembly,  Do you have a bentley for pics?

see brake pedal assembly pic in bus parts list (foot lever system)  at

 *Question*
 Brake pedal Rebuild. I know I'm lazy and haven't read any books or
 researched the archives, but strung out working on this and looking for an
 easy answer. The brake pedal won't return at all. I'm sure the spring is
 worn, but it feels like it is more than that. Any ideas? I really didn't
 look into it much as it was very late when I got this far (this was all
 yesterday, worked late today and haven't got to get back out to it). Any
 ideas or suggestions on things to look for? I'm sure this is an easy
 process, but I dont post to the list much anyway and I'm excited about
 progress so far. With any luck, I'll finish the brake system this weekend. &gt;&gt;
