After looking over this bus, I wonder why it has semiphores as well as front turn
signals?  Why would it have both, unless they were added when it was brought to the
states.

Thanks,

&gt; The correct URL for Rob's new bus is:

&gt;
&gt; He also forgot to metion it's a EURO '59 Panel with semaphores! So with my
&gt; '59 Euro SC and Gensler's Euro SC I guess there were a lot of European's or
&gt; military guys moving to Texas!
