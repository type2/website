i am trying to figure out what show to go to this weekend.i am in need of 
some misc parts for my 64 bus i just put on the road i.e a ingnition switch 
complete,a right door latch,a pop out latch,a steering dampner,some 
mirrors,and a vent window latch.i am closer to the show this sunday in 
MANASSAS VA,I havent been there in 5 years but back then it was a good 
show.but there is also a show in PA it is the  BUG MEET 4 I have never been 
there and i was wondering if anyone has been to either one and could tell me 
what one would be a show for type 2 parts.

thanx
mike(64 kombi)
