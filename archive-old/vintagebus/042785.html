Well,

i cant say on the ammounts, i just ask others ;)  but... I was going to
buy some glassurit, but it is extemely expensive.  You can take the
glasurit paint codes to other paint dealers and get pretty much the same
thing color wise, in a cheaper brand (dupont etc.)

Others may well be willing to shoulder the expense for correctness, but i
probably wont (unless i someday decide to do a full resto on something...)

take care,

Steve
