&gt;
&gt; The Bus Depot is hiring agan!
&gt;
&gt; We have openings for either full or part time, seasonal or permanent.
&gt; Position is entry-level (meaning you start in the shipping dept. and work
&gt; your way up), as we promote from within.  On the other hand there's
&gt; definately plenty of potential for advancement; we're a small company so
&gt; every employee is an important part of the whole.  Hours are weekdays 11-7
&gt; (if full-time); weekends off. No experience is neccessary. We're
&gt; conveniently located smack in the middle of nowhere - in rural Montgomery
&gt; County, Pa.,  about 30-45 miles from Philadelphia, Reading, or Allentown.
&gt;
&gt; Please p-mail me if interested, or pass this along if you know someone who
&gt; may be interested.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ron Salmon
&gt; The Bus Depot, Inc.
