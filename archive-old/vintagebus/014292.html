SCORE!
Today, with the help of fellow listee Jim Becker and
his girlfriend Kristen, I pulled a 66 Kombi out of a
yard north of Reno. The bus has been sitting for about
14 years in this side yard with about 5 Ghias several
Loafs couple of Bugs and about 3 tons of parts. It is
almost completely straight (couple of small dings)
with nothing more then light surface rust in a few
spots. The mechanicals seem tight and the underside is
totally clean. About the worst thing on the bus is the
three side windows that were shot out with a BB gun.
However, the price was right! (up to seven splits now,
must seek help) The speedo shows 63000miles, and I
feel considering the condition of the underside of the
bus and the overall stance and feel, that is indeed 63
thousand original miles(maybe 163 thousand really easy
miles). 
Anyways...
I need help on the M-Codes,

425--US Specs
002-- ?
043--Prepared for Swiss requirements.  What up with
this?
080--Walk Thru
177--Additional rear seat 
*So whats with the Swiss requirements?*

17 9
UF 2312 131383 6028687
Paint code L87

Any help out there on 043.

Thanks
