I remember one of these in Gainesville Florida. Mark Rafferty and I went to 
this yard that sounds so similar to your description. It used to be a park so 
the vegetation was prominent. But the current owner turned it into a wrecking 
yard after he bought it. In the very back corner was most of the older cars, 
including model T's and A's. The owner died and the only way to get the car 
you wanted was when they had crushed all the cars that was in the way of 
yours. What they did is they would spray paint your phone number on the car, 
and when they were getting close they gave you a ring and told you to come 
down and get your vehicle. Lots of unmolested busses in there because the 
owner would never let anyone in the yard. I even &quot;found&quot; a bus in there, it 
was hidden under vines, and the tire stack, and the bus itself was also the 
starter and generator bin. I pulled a ambo divider out of it, which is in 
pristine shape thanks to Greg Noble, who ended up with it through some horse 
trading.

&lt;&lt; OK, Picture this....a junk yard that has not seen anything but scavengers
 and onlookers for 4 to 5 years.  It's not your typical junk yard with stacks
 of bodys with a oily dirt trail between the stacks.  These are bodys that
 were stacked or placed at random starting from the back of the yard
 forward.  It's kind of a history story like the bands of a tree trunk.  Time
 does move forward.  It's kind of a maze of cars, trucks, and heavy
 contuction equipment including a railroad track and tie layer.  Most of this
 stuff is now covered with weeds and berry vines in such a way that it's art
 in its self.  &gt;&gt;
