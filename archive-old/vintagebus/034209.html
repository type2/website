Arizona -- Lake Havasu City -- Buses By the Bridge!  London Bridge!

I will be picking up my girlfriend Tristan at the Las Vegas airport Friday
morning and returning her to Vegas Friday Monday morning.  Anyone else
coming down from Seattle who wants a ride from the airport?

Those of you in Seattle... $120 round trip for a weekend of nice weather!
Think about it :)  Great bus town, great resort town.  Lots of stuff to do
here in Lake Havasu for cheap.

YOU MUST BOOK these flights before midnight Tuesday!  Friday 21, Saturday
22, Sunday 22rd are the show dates.

  Renton, Washington .. working in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.

P.S.  I am returning to Renton for New Years, leaving Wednesday morning!
