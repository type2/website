I've had excellent results using brass valves and fittings obtained at a
NAPA store, but most any FLAPS or marine supply should have what you need.
Attaching a valve directly to the fuel tank _might_ require an adapter to
match the metric threads.

I've never looked for valves and fittings with metric threads, but they're
probably available.  At worst you might have to order them or an adapter and
wait a few days.

It just occurred to me that a dealer in Japanese or European motorcycles and
parts might have what you need in stock, plus a filter setup to go with the
valve.  Wouldn't hurt to ask.....

&gt;&gt; A fuel shut-off valve will be helpful for those frequent filter changes
(not to mention a handy theft
prevention device)

Any recomendtions as to where to buy one or a specific kind that has worked
for you? &lt;&lt;
