Subject: Re: [VB] 70 westy stuff into a 61?

hi, the folding bed bolts right in, The bay folding bed it more comfy than a 
splitty one anyway.

For putting it an a standard or deluxe you will need to chop out some of the 
wooden floor under the bed to fit around the heat log, and i'd leave the door 
off to let the heat vent into the bus rather than be trapped under the bed..  
This is what I did in my 61, and it's makes the bed nice and prewarmed when 
you get to the camping space on a cool day.

The side cabinet is a little too long for a splitty.  You can take it apart 
and shorten it and put it back together to fit a split.  Dunno if there is a 
faq about it, but with a measuring tape and woodworking tools it can be done, 
not too big a deal.

&lt;&lt; Hi all, I found a 70 westy being parted out in the Dallas area today. I
 bought the z-bed for $40, now I'm kinda half-way thinking about maybe
 getting the tall side closet that goes next to it and the overhead
 cabinet that goes over the very back top area. Can someone please tell me
 if these would fit into a 61 kombi ? The z-bed looks like it'll go in
 with no problems, but do the closet and overhead cabinet fit or would
 they need modified? 

 Thanks, Chris
