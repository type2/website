Hi John,
You are welcome!  To improve on this even more you should get some small 
diameter yellow lensed trailer bulb holders and mount them on the license 
plate frame and/or use type 1 or 3 backup lights mounted on the rear bumper 
with yellow painted on the inside of the lenses.  Hook these up to the same 
wire for the signal of the tail lights.  This helps greatly since most of our 
fellow drivers do not pay much attention to the red signals as to yellow!  We 
found this out when we tried Euro yellow topped tail lights on our 12 volted 
63 KG that we had previously run with the all red American market type tail 
light lenses.  Made a huge differance on the highway for changing lanes.  
Plus as an added CYA with the extra signal filament you can have one bulb 
burn out and still have a signal light on that side.
