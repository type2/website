NQ,

Rods are typically rebuilt by shaving a bit off the big end mating surface and
honing back to the standard diameter.  .060 (not .60)/.080 (not .80) *should*
be bore oversize/thrust undersize. ie: the bore is .060 larger requiring
thicker bearings and the thrust surfaces are .080 thinner, requiring thicker
thrust washers.  You *could* measure to verify...

&gt; Tonight I measured all the journals of my crank to make sure that it's a
&gt; .10/.10 grind and it is.
&gt;
&gt; Next I measured the insides of the rebuild rods on the big end and came up
&gt; with 2.270&quot; average between the 4 but I couldn't find the spec for a rebuilt
&gt; T1 1600 rod.  Are rebuilts merely honed (per the Tom Wilson rebuild book) or
&gt; s there a spec for the large end on the rod???
&gt;
&gt; Another question is - when the case is bored .60/.80 - what order is this?
&gt; Is this align/thrust or thrust/align?  Once I know this, I an order my
&gt; bearings.  Thanks!!!
