its scary , you just need to drive slower, hit the brakes for a few seconds 
to keep your speed down, then let them cool before hitting them again.

Fun rides are going down the Grapevine towards Bakersfield, you can smell the 
big truck brakes and its a LONG downhill run,  

if you did not use your brakes or engine to slow down you would easily be 
going 80 MPH plus

I would never put in neutral going down a big hill like this, you have no 
control and in an Emergancy may not be able to get it into gear to use engine 
braking...

thats why there are signs for the trucks, I think 35mph max so they will not 
get out of control, or they may have to use the gravel emergancy truck 
pull-outs
