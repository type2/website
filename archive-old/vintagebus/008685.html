im installing rebuilt spindles in my 66,  i had new bushings put in and i
have new linkpin kits, when i put the pin in the bottom on the drivers side
, i really had to tap it hard to get it in there with the needle bearings on
it, it went in fine but very tight, the top on the drivers side just slid
right in and feels loose, even has a slight up down play in it, so my
question is how exactly is it supposed to be?
