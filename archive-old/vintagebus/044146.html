TMI is good.  I dont really like the new vinyl smell, but I suppose new vinyl 
smells like new vinyl.  They have a lot more colours available now, including 
some original style splitty upholstery.  If you wanted to have your bus seats 
similiar to what they were like when new.  Someone posted it recently, I 
think on the Wolfsberg West page they have up the original colours  (inside 
and out) the buses came with.  Maybe it is on Thoms or Everett's page too.
