Subject: Re: [VB] The benefits of women dealing on vehicles.

&gt;I've seen guys sending their girls to bargain on parts.

Yeh, I don't think it really works AS GOOD at swaps. I do like to pull this
&quot;cheap shot&quot; on individuals out in public though. Like I said before, it
works to my benefit about 90% of the time.

&gt;If you're going to &quot;use&quot; a woman for something like this, at least
&gt;*educate* her first so you don't both look like idiots.

It is true that both of you should know your stuff. BUT...as you bus
hunters know, you don't want to let on that you know TOO much...at least at
first. Then the party in question will know your a VW person and figure
you'll pay a lot more or even be intimidated or annoyed by you enough to
just blow you off (ever have one of those guys chew your ear off telling
you everything HE knows about VW's and how he's &quot;seen and done it all&quot;).
Even at a swap I think it's better that the seller not know your a &quot;bus&quot;
person or an &quot;oval bug&quot; guy or whatever. Better to be looking for a little
of this or that and not be a know-it-all I think. I get farther being a
little more subtle about a deal instead of say using &quot;official&quot; vw people
lingo. When you talk to the old farmer, your &quot;curious about that old vw van
(YES I SAID VAN) in the back&quot; &amp; not &quot;how much for the 23-window Barndoor
Deluxe Bus&quot;. I usually go into it as just interested in looking at it and
hearing stories, ect. THEN I might talk to 'em about selling it after I've
put some time into it. And like I said before, nothing breaks the ice like
a nice looking women. That's just the reality down here in the south. My
wife is REAL good at making deals ($50 set of safari's, $5 bus emblem, $1
working deluxe clock, ect., ect, ect.) and she really takes pride in the
fact that SHE got the stuff. She knows enough about vw's to have fun with
it and still be able to &quot;break out some knowledge&quot; when she needs too.
Whatever it takes! Heck, I've even asked a few folks if my 3 yr. old son
could take a look at their &quot;neat&quot; VW. I'm not lying to them. He really does
want to see their car. It's just that I wouldn't mind getting a better look
myself ;)
