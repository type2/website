&gt; I'm wanting to blaze some new personal trails with this T4 design.
&gt; Obviously I'll know more as time goes on but couldn't a guy run 34-pict-3
&gt; carbs as duals to feed a 2L engine?  Dual webers are nice but then how in
&gt; the hell can the average Joe hope to enjoy the benefits of a T4 if you don't
&gt; cheat and simplify here and there?

Why not go simpler still and run 30PICT-1's?  I've also toyed with the
idea of running Mikuni motorcycle carbs, such as the one that feeds my
Honda XR600.  They would be very tunable, but they're sidedraft, requiring
some manifold creativity.

&gt; I have a question about making my own manifold.  What are the repurcussions
&gt; of welding up your own manifold out of steel?  I suck with aluminum stuff
&gt; but I'm wondering why VW used steel intakes on SP engines and then went to
&gt; aluminum on the dual port heads of the 1600?

Well, the expansion rate is different for steel and aluminum.  When the
head heats up, the difference in expansion between the steel and manifold
would be about 10 thousandths between the manifold studs.  Not much, but
the difference could cause vacuum leaks eventually.
