&gt; Unca dave,

&gt; Eastwood sells a fancy machine to do just that!

&gt; I suspect that a couple of hours rather than all day might do it though.

&gt; &gt; I was thinking that a really good way to clean all the hardware (nuts, bolts,

Well, rock tumblers change sharp pointy rocks to smooth round rocks.
They will also change the sharp pointy threads on your bolts to nice
smooth round threads.  To a lesser extent, they will do the same thing to
those sharp pointy hex corners on the bolt heads.

I don't think that this is what you had in mind!  :)

My method is to take all the hardware and put it in a paint can with some
lacquer thinner.  Close it up and leave it for a few days and it will get
rid of all the
built-up grime.  Doesn't work for rust, though.  You might try a dip in
muriatic acid for that, but proceed cautiously with this as the acid is
nasty and will eat metal.
