Subject: RE: Front Step ups
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have front step ups on my 65. I was told by the PO that they were original.  The rubber on them is pretty worn.  I called Wolfsberg West looking for new covers, they told me that those were add-ons, but that they were not a standard size, and therefore could not sell me new covers.  The salesman reccommended basically cutting the step down, until it was small enough to be covered by the gas pedal covers.
