While you are all very right about cost...as the saying goes speed costs money or in this case power costs money no matter in what form. The throwout bearing to pressure is a tricky one but I believe Kennedy has an adapter (again spendy). There was a good solid way around this. I never like the cutting of a bus. If done properly, with an upright shroud of some kind there is no cutting and reversal back to stock is not a major issue. More involved than stock 1600 to stock 1200 but not all that bad. As for the IRS again you can do the IRS without lowering the bus. VERY costly! but have you priced a new minivan? As far as expense of a type IV motor...any time you go the high performance route, especially if done right it will at least cost double of a quality stock job usually more. You are asking a lot of an air cooled engine. Hope this helps someone. PLEASE DON'T CUT EM, I am tired of welding them back together.

PS  As for resale value you ar 100% right Clara. But like my busses each can be returned to stock and they are not for sale.
