 &gt;What I have done is liberally douse the engine compartment with simple
 &gt;green.  [...] couple hours later take it to the self swerve car wash 
 
 Is there any danger of cracking the case here?  Warm engine, cold water.
 I guess having it sit for two hours to let the cleaner work (engine not
 running) implies that the engine will get to cool somewhat.  Just
 curious...

well, I have done this a number of times, and the case hasn't cracked yet.   
I do let it soak in my driveway a while, then drive 5 miles to the self 
swerve car wash, so it gets 5 miles of warming up.

I prefer hot water as it cleans better, but too often the car wash spits cold 
instead.

I have also driven from off the freeway down the parkway and there was a huge 
puddle  I only could slow to 25 MPH before I hit it, that sprayed loads of 
water up under the motor, (up the outside of the bus too, I suppose, it did 
come in through the holes in the front floor) and promptly turned the heat 
into a fogger, causing instant lack of visibility.  oops.  that didn't crack 
the case either. 

as to clean motors, they can be too clean.  I mean if you do not have any 
oozes at all the case will corrode visibly.  best to spray some oil on it.
