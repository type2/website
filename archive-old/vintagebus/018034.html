(*sigh*)  You get what you pay for...

I bought a Kragen (chucks, checker, shucks, et-al) generator once.
I got it home looked at it, and immediately boxed it up and took it
back.  It was the crappiest rebuild I'd ever seen.  The commutator
was badly worn and scored from a previous life, the bushes barely
made contact with it.  They basically had washed it, ground down the 
commutator, installed new brushes and painted it black.  I happily spent
the extra $40 on a Real Bosch one _at_ the VW shop.

Sure it has a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; - but how many times do you want to
be going thru the hassle of changing a generator just for the sake
of saving $40?  The real-deal bosch one will last a LOT longer.  Also,
you won't get to pick when the cheepie generator takes a dive.  I
went thru 3 &quot;lifetime&quot; starters in two years in my '56 before I said 
&quot;screw it&quot; and bought a real one, which is still going in the bus today.

The whole &quot;lifetime&quot; warranty is a gimmick to get people to buy the crap,
when in real life they don't expect you to own the car long enough to
collect on it.

FWIW, my local VW-FLAPS doesn't have rebuilt generators and starters any
more - they only have new for about the same price.  Fine by me.

&gt; Thought I'de share the good deal.  If you call and ask it is listed as an
&gt; alternater.  I think the part number is 15270.  The only generator they
&gt; list is an $80 Bosch.  So if you want a good deal look for their $40
&gt; generator with a lifetime warrenty.  The one I bought was originaly made by
&gt; Bosch and rebuilt in some impoverished 3rd world country by barefoot
&gt; children.  But hay it only cost $40 and I never have to buy another one again.
