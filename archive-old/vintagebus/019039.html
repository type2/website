Have you thoroughly cleaned the case?  Sufficient grease buildup can
act very glue like.  Also, are you sure this is a split-case
transmission?

Assuming the above to all be &quot;yes&quot;, then my approach would be to get
a couple of spreader clamps (often used in woodworking; the jaws go
out instead of in).  One needs to be fairly small, so you can fit the
jaws with some wood padding into the nosecone end.  The other needs to
be large, so it can span the bellhousing (again with some wood
padding).  Open them both at the same time, very slowly.

I hate to ask this, but have you ever done tranny work before?
There's a reason most people won't touch any that they aren't familiar
with.  Don't forget to have something set up to catch all the little
springs and such when you go to fiddling with the innards....
