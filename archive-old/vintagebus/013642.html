Hello All....
 Ive been &quot;out of pocket&quot; for a while, but Im back:)
And new &amp; improved... While off the list we finally
scored our first Splitty!!! Its been in storage in San
Angelo, Texas for 12 years. Very good shape IMHO. Been
drivin it all over the back roads....
 Now for the question (yall knew I was getting to
that, right:)
 The gates are very straight, even tho it was used on
a farm (has TX farm truck plates), but when theyre
folded down, you can see the rust eating at them. Not
on the body side, but on the long channel used for the
&quot;frame&quot; of the gates. Is it possible to replace just
the channel or do I need to start lookin for gates?
 The engine isnt original, imagine that. It is a T1 AE
case, 1600 DP. Now when we were trying to get it in,
it seemed that something was in the way, so I removed
the T1 forward tin. It slide right in. Was this right,
does it get in the way, or was I just not holdin my
mouth right? It looks like it &quot;should&quot; fit. 
 Lookin for drivers side windshield (will dr &amp; pass
interchange?) Treasurechest doors, a seat in good
shape, mine need recovering, but if we can find a nice
one.... &amp; a correct outside rear view mirror. prefer
to find em in TX, OK, or AR area....
 Thanks for any help,
