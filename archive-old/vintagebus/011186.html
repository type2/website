 After about a month of them being off, I finally got spindles of stock
 height. Shimming is weird, with 3 inner and 4 outer? My offset is almost
 perfectly 5.5 to 6 on each side. Totally wrong shimming according to
 Bentley. Any place to get just shims, not a whole link pin set?
 Also, I needed to use a jack to raise the lower torsion arm up to get
 the pins even close to go in. The pins were very tight trying to go into
 the eyes, now I understand I must correctly shim first, but can I open
 up the 'eyes' of the torsion arms with a pry bar? Everything is well
 greased, and it is impossible to be even close without jack pressure.
 Bentley says not to put the link pin caps on until spindle is installed.
 Does this imply I can whack with a rubber deadblow on the link pin to
 install these? BFHing seems immennent to get this done.

I suggest rubber mallet rather than BFH.   

I also use jack to help with aligning the trailing arms

Yes you can use a big screw driver to open the trailing arms where the links 
go through
