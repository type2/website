&gt; On my 1963 VW Hearse the right side mirror is &quot;convex&quot; so i actually see more
&gt; than a regular mirror--really need that as &quot;Drakula&quot; is a little tough moving to
&gt; the right with no back window or side window. As a side note the VW Museum of
&gt; America does not want Drakula, my VW Hearse, in their museum--&quot;Too Morbid&quot;!! As
&gt; of now it looks like Japan will be the next &quot;resting spot&quot; for Drakula.   This
&gt; is one heck of a Splittie! Perhaps the most solid one i have ever driven--at
&gt; just 26,000Km there is a lot of &quot;Life&quot;
&gt; left in Drakula--TWWM, uj

Well heck, if you're looking for a museum to put it in I'll make room for it in the
&quot;Vintage Warehouse Museum of early VW Buses&quot; and on the same note I'll extend this
same offer to the '54 Barnambulator. No charge to either of you of course!!
