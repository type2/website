Subject: How much for a 67 Westy?

I'm thinking about selling my 67 Westy, how much should I ask for? The
engine was just rebuilt, so was the transmission. New shocks and brakes
all around. New front bench seat. New stereo (nothing great, but it is
&quot;better&quot; than stock). It is a California car so there is very minimal
rust, there is really only one bad place under the drivers feet. The
rest of the interior is in decent shape. The bad stuff: the front clip
has some dents and the entire car could use some paint. I plan on doing
some more work like painting the inside floor and the underside, trying
to fix some dents, and maybe even paint it. What do you all think would
be a fair price? I am selling it here in NJ, I don't know if that could
factor in since there don't seem to be as many old VWs in the rust belt.

Thanks,
Chris
