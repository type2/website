Subject: Re: [VB] Restoring heat exchangers 

Kymco (http://www.kymcovw_dot_com/Pages/special_coating.html) offer a
ceramic-coating service for exhaust stuff, including heater boxes - I had
my boxes and new muffler done, and they look incredible,
and should last a long time. The coating doesn't adversely affect threaded
holes for some reason, and goes on smooth and very chip-resistant.

They are in southern Cal, and can receive your parts and reship when done.
