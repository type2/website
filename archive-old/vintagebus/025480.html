I have read the recent discussion on oil filtering.

Have anyone of you informations on full flow oil filters like the maxi
pump 2 (?). How much are they in the states ? In Germany I can get a
full flow filter for ca 85 $.
Would you recommend a filter like this for a fresh rebuild standard 1600
engine ?
