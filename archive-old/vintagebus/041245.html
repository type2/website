The gap is due to the manufacturing process.
Try fitting sheet metal to a pipe without a gap.
Difficult, or at least time con$umming.
One of those cost of sealing vs benefit trade offs.
Betcha VW didn't factor leaky exhausts into the
equation tho!
Brian's solution seems easy for the DIY'er.

I believe the gap in the heater boxes that the article was referring to is
the one up on the flap assembly, which dumps air out towards the head when
the exchanger flap is closed.

I wouldn't worry much about having those gaps at the ends of the pipes
sealed up.  I bet they're too small to offer effective cooling when the
exchanger is closed.  I've been sealing up those gaps with RTV for years,
and never had any such &quot;meltdown&quot; problems with my heat exchangers.

Steven's reply -
Re: the process you performed below...I'm 99.9% sure that the designers of
said heat exchange system had a reason for the gap you welded shut.
