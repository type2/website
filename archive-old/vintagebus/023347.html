Subject: Safari Screwup? Help!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

I ran into a problem when switching the broken CE safaris with the 
replacement ones that they sent. The holes which were originally drilled to 
mount them were perfect. Now the new frames are slightly different as in 
having less holes and the location of them is off by anywhere from 1/4&quot; to 
1/8&quot;. One of the holes though is off by about 1/2&quot;. So what do I do? Should i 
enlongate the holes on the frames themselves to match? No i didnt install the 
plates for the mounting screws. Bummer.
