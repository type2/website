Subject: Re: [VB] Harber Freight Sandblaster

Yes, I have one, and it works great, but never choke off the valve at the
end of the hose, only full open, or full closed (you can adjust the flow at
the blaster itself), because if you don't, it washed the valve, and then it
won't shut off the sand at all. Other than that it works great, much better
than the one that sucks out of a bag (I had a sears version).

I have ran about 500lbs of sand through it, and it still works great, and
still on the first tip.

&gt; Harbor Freight has a 40 pound pressurized sand blaster on sale for $80.
&gt; Anyone have one or Used One?  Are they any good? I have one of their
venturi
&gt; type units that sucks the sand out of a bag. It sure is slow. Is the
&gt; pressurized unit better?
&gt; Time to blast out the rust from behind the nose skin.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
