hi all!  i've been contemplating the idea of a Westfalia only 'zine type
thing for a while, and would like to know if you bus folk would be
interested in something like that. this would be a printed (xerox type)
thing. i know the 2 &quot;big&quot; bus sites online have westfalia sections, but i
personally enjoy going to the mailbox(outside) and getting something new to
read/look at. i'm thinking about something along the lines of what &quot;camp
box news&quot; used to be, with mostly reader input.  i'd also like to start
(yet another, i know) very informal westfalia &quot;regisrty&quot;, just to keep
track and keep people in touch with eachother.  i am NOT doing this to try
to get great deals on stuff or undercut someone, since i have the busses i
want right now, except for that pre-58 westy i haven't found yet.  i am
wanting to do this because the national scene doesn't cover westfalias all
that much, and  info and pics are few and far between.  there would be NO
68 or newer busses, and probably a bias toward pre 64 stuff, but a split is
a split is a split...
interested?  just drop me a quick line so i can judge interest before i use
up alot of time and $$$ for nothing. 
JP, you're already on the list! :)
