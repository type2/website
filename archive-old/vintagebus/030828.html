&gt; Just to let everyone know that Flat 4 will be back in the U.S. shortly.  So
&gt; DON'T pay those crazy prices for the BRM's and the EMPI sprint stars that
&gt; everyone thinks are now worth a small fortune. The link is as follows:

&gt;

Yeah they're back, which is great if you want wheels for your New Beetle or PT
Cruiser. That a close look. That's *all* they are selling right now.

Is $800 a crazy price to pay for a set of BRM's like you say? I don't think so,
that's why I'm selling them. Have a look on my site, and original Sprint Stars
are going to cost more than repops no matter who is selling
what....................
