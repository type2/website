the taillight holes were moved in dec 59, at ch 422 670.  the height above ground was changed to 635 unladen bus, meaning 100mm lower than before, and also 12mm nearer to outside. 

one book I have says the stamped bumpers were used through ch # 384 999
another says through 384 815 (euro) and through 384 874 (for overrider countrys) 

slight discrepancy in the numbers, so so much for german perfectionism.  what did you get on your bus ch 384 923?  anyone got one?

also that the starting handle was no longer supplied as if the switch to sturdy bumpers.

not that the rest of the crankstart stuff was no longer supplied, , but doesn't exclude that (must cross refernce to check)  which is why I had said that the sturdy bumper 36hp buses were not crankstart, but maybe ou had to buy a crankstart handle as extra.  and several 36hp sturdy bumper bus people say their 59s came with the crankstart apron.  I firmly believe that. 

 I have also have a wierd crankstart apron that has the notch for the tailpipe on the side, original, not hacked in like when a bug muffler gets put on a bus.  so that was made for a bastard 40hp or later crankstart bus, which tells me you could get that as an option for your post 36hp.  It was off a 1960 SC
