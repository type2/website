That screw in the end of the thingy is resting on the half moon shaped object,
should it be resting on the stair half of this object.

yup- the stair part moves with the choke going on.  When it flips around and
the the thingy lands on the round part of the round/stair thingy it means the
pin holding it from doing that is AWOL.  Look at the left side- there should
be a slot in the round/stair thingy, a pin through it stuck into a hole in the
carb body.   I have tapped other thingys in there, such as a nail, which
worked.   find something the right size
