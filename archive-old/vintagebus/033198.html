&lt;&lt; The case # starts with &quot;f 6xxxxxx&quot; which according to Muir is a 1965 case 
for a 1300/1500 motor.  Can this case be used for a 1600?  If not, what are 
the major differences?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Yes, you can though the later DR cases are just better especially for the bus 
due to better oil passages/relief valves and certain cases have higher 
aluminum content.  The latter makes them more resistant to high engine temps 
which causes the case to soften and allow the head studs to pull out even 
when case savered.  Eric&amp;Barb
