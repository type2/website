65 Split Window Bus Camper Conversion Package

Ad By:  jewallace (0) 
Location:   Bozeman, Montana 
Category:   Vans  
Price:  $1,200.00  


1965 VW Splitwindow Bus
MINIMAL Rust--Ready for restoration


Engine has been upgraded to Case # F15528711600 with a 12 Volt system. 
Compression is strong on all four cylinders. Could use a muffler. Starts 
easily every time, even when very cold outside.

Body is very restorable, small area of rust behind the drivers side door. 
Right rear wheel cylinder seems to be leaking brake fluid so brakes are soft. 
Interior package is not Westfalia two people have suggested that it may be a 
Sundial Conversion. I would re-do it if I could keep it.
