&lt;&lt; Just got the newsletter from the Golden Gate VVWCA
 with preliminary information on the Spring Meet.  
 
 I quote from the newsletter:
 
 &quot;We are eliminating the modified classes and will no
 longer have awards for these classes...We also decided
 that we would only let show cars inside the park, this
 means no general parking, no non VW's, no dealers, no
 New Beetles, etc. We will still have swappers but will
 be more selective on sponsors and vendors.&quot;
 
 The date is set for April 22, 2001
