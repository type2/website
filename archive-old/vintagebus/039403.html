Never been before.  I am hoping to see lots of buses, and pick up a few 
parts, esp a set of dual carbs.  Should I drive my bus down?  The factory 
A/C on my '66 is broken and it sure would be nice to drive the car down.  
Just a little worried about getting stuff ripped off in LA.  Is is safe to 
park my bus there, my fron't doors don't lock and its not that secure of a 
vehicle anyway?

BTW: Just kidding about that A/C

Was goin to the campout, but the wife said no :(
