 I am trying to remove the centre cap from the front wheel bearing housings.
 
 There is an obvious cotter pin in the centre of the brake drum casing,
 presumably preventing the nut cap from comming off.
 I have removed it, but can find no way to remove the cap.  I was assuming
 that it was pressed on  and that underneath I would find a large centre nut
 in the centre of the spindle.  Unfortunately the cap is too round &amp; smooth
 to grip with anything to rotate it.
  &gt;&gt;
it sounds like you are working on the driver's side front of a 63 or earlier.
The cotter pin holds the speedo cable to the dust cap.  Remove the cotter pin
and push the speedo cable into the dust cap.

  Then You Take Two Hammers.

Put a claw tooth hammer claw side against the dust cap.  And hit the peen side
with the other hammer.  This is in order to get the angle of impact to push
the dust cap off the drum, towards you, away from the center line of the bus.
It is easy with this technique, but a PITA before I was shown it , and I hope
is makes sense the way I explain it.  Move the hammer around to tap on
different sides of teh dust cap. 

And I hope this is what you are talking about, if you had posted the year etc
of what you are doing I would be more clear.
