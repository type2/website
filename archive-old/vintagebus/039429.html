&quot;USA glass is laminated, the plastic laminate between the 2 pieces of glass 
keeps most of the pieces from getting in the car&quot;

is this why American glass has a slight green tint to it? i broke a front 
windshield from my westy delivered to the US and replaced it with a 
windshield from my westy delivered to germany and the US piece looks 
different (green) when i look through it and then the other. now im kinda 
glad the US piece is in front of the driver... me!
