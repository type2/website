Subject: All Kinds of Stuff FS

I am losing one of my storage places (ex father-in-law) and need to get
rid of a helluva lot of stuff.  Remember the thread about what's in your
garage?  Well I may not have all of you beat, but I should go into
business with all this stuff.  Here is a list of some of the stuff I can
remember at the moment.  More stuff will show up as I start moving and
selling it.  Don't hesitate to email me with a request.  90% of the
stuff is early bus.  The rest is Porsche, Volvo, Mercedes, Bug and bay
window.

Anyway, here's some bus stuff:

15&quot; slotted bus wheels
2 cargo doors (65 deluxe)
2 cargo doors (6? camper)
Dual Header (bug style)
1-5/8&quot; Merge w/side muffler set-up
2 fake Porsche Alloys 15x6
4 Porsche Alloys 15x6
Wheel Adapters for above
'56 front end, drum to drum
'67 trans - 3.88, bug 4th, super diff, large cross shaft, 0 miles
68/69 middle seat 2/3 fair condition (fits early)
68/69 middle seat full, good condition (fits early)
Air cleaner tube (left side version) good condition
Laminated Sliding Window Channels
Pedal Pans
Heater Boxes
1600cc complete core
36hp running engine
36hp cores
40hp bastard core
914 tach

There is a lot more, but can't think right now.  Pics are available of
almost everything.  Best offer takes.
