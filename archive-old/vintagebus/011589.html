&gt; I have lots of useless sandblasters I've accumulated overthe years,

I'm scared to see what your pad looks like - parts and stuff strewn all over...

&gt; I just picked of a Harbor Freight-Chinese special
&gt; The key: Pressurized container
&gt; Holds maybe 5-8 gallons of sand, it is blown out under pressure, 75lbs I
&gt; believe.  Was on sale,
&gt; Half price special $99

These have been $99 for *years*

I have one.  I wasn't happy with the performance, so I upgraded the hose and
valve to professional-quality hose with deadman-valve.  *Much* better
operation.  Cost me $225 though.  I also spent another $25 to upgrade
all the fittings and valves, so I'm intp this blaster for ~$350.  For
under $400 I could have bought a nicer unit to start with, that came with
all the nice plumbing, and has an improved design top, soyou don't need
a funnel to fill it.

You learn...

I can blast it as quick as you could paint it with a rattle-can.
