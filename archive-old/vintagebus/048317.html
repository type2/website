 &lt;&lt; Anyway, on the rearview mirror there is a flip down smoked plastic cover 
 for
  those nasty highbeams in the mirror.  Ive never seen this before and this
  thing is in excellent shape.  Is this a rare accesory, and whats its value
  you think? the mirror and shade are in great shape.   &gt;&gt;
 
 If it an original period piece it may be valuable to someone.  They are 
being 
 reproduced and available through Koch, Vintage Parts and the like. I have a 
 repo in my Single Cab and works great when you get a jacked up 4x4 behind 
you.

ya, I do believe they are still making them.  I was thinking of getting one 
myself, seem pretty useful to reduce that glare from those high beam behind 
you, or lights that look like high beams.
