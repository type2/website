I read a post from someone wanting an owner's manual and remembered a guy I 
met at a VW/Porsche 356 show in Oregon a few years back. He has an amazing 
amout of manuals and literature for sale.  They are affordable and protected 
in plactic bags. They are priced differently depending on availibility and 
condition.

Anyway, I'm more than happy to send the guy's business card info to anyone 
who is interested. I would post it on the listserv but I'm not sure if 
that's appropriate/acceptable. Any input?

Also, I recently found a perfect copy of a '79 Westfalia in an evelope in a 
bus I bought recently. (Along with a huge stash of maps). I have scanned it 
and have been thinking about posting it on my meager web page. I'm a little 
nervous because of copyright stuff. The manual is no longer in print 
obviously, but I don't know if that makes it ok or not.  Does anyone have 
any info on that kind of thing?  I read recently in HotVW's that they are 
contacting people to remove things from their pages because of copyright 
infringement.

I'd be willing to send a copy of the manual to individuals... let me know if 
you're interested.
