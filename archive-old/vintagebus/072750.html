Subject: RE: [VB] Road music or not

Had college roommates who (1)Was learning to play guitar via repetitive
attempts at Cinnamon Girl and Old Young. Over and OVer and OH-ver again.
(2) Next year was wall-to-wall Dylan. only Dylan played by a kid from upstate
Nyak. After that I tried to avoid roomies.

Amigos over the wall at my Casa de la Phoenix Centro play Ranchero with glee
all weekend. The polka beat Bomp-boomp-boompa is usally my head against the
wall. There is no &quot;as-if&quot; about how'd you like to hear only Mexican music in my hood.
