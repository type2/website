I agree that they do drink a lot of Pils, especially in the north but it is
usually of a high quaility, such as Koenig Pils or Bitburger and to to say
that Budweiser is a quality beer is a stretch of the imagination.  The only
decent Budweiser is the original one still brewed in the Czech Rep.

&lt;&lt; Paulaner is definitely from Bavaria but I dont think that
Warsteiner is.  Warsteiner, Becks and St. Pauli Girl are rather lackluster
beers by German standards but are still better than American mass-produced
swill like Miller, Bud or Old Piles.  As far as Milwaukee's
Best...arrggghhh....better lets not speak of it.  I would rather drink my
own urine.  I am not sure if WOB has a local brew.&gt;&gt;

I think you will find most Germans drink Pilsner beers.  They taste much
like
Budweiser.
This is the most common type of beer I've found in Germany.

I used to work for Budweiser, which if you care to believe it or not, is a
well made good quality beer still using the same recipe brought over from
Germany more than 100 years ago.
