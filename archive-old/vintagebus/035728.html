&lt;&lt; Don't you have one of these mysterious beasts?&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Yes we do!

&lt;&lt;What kind of info do you know about them?&gt;&gt;
Well we have an english speaking slaes brochure and a 1961-62 SO-34 Westie 
owners manual.

&lt;&lt;What years they were available, different options, why there are so few, 
etc. etc.&gt;&gt;
Well so far we have found that they were mainly made in from 1961 to 63ish 
and after that on up to 1965 they could only be special ordered.  Though we 
have heard of a 1966 or 67 highroof panel van with this style of seat factory 
installed in it.  The SO-34 came with white formica cabinets and the SO-35 
had wood ones of the same design, and both had the front flip seat that 
allowed it to be used as a rear facing seat when camping.  The only reason we 
can figure for the low production of these Westfalia campers is that the 
interior cabinets and rear seats are very complicated to manufacture and even 
more of a Chinese jigsaw puzzle to take out and install.  Plus for the 
flip-seat to be installed the body of the bus had to be built as a walk-thru 
and on top of that the support walls that would normally be behind walk-thru 
seats had to be cut down so the flip-seat would work.  All of which had to be 
done at the Hanover factory before the body was painted.  
  We are trying to find out how many of the SO-34 &amp; 35 Westies still exist 
and are running a registery to find this out.  Plus are coming up with 
interesting info by collecting the info from the M-code plates of them.  Like 
the fact that many of the campers in 1961 have SO-23 camper code stamped in 
thier M-code plates.  We also are helping fellow owners find the parts for 
thier campers.  If you or anyone else has one of these campers please contact 
us.  If anyone wants images of these buses we would be happy to Pmail them.
