Subject: My weekend: Q-pads and Kool-Patch, painting a door...

    I got my Q-pads... two different sizes are available. I got what was
there, a little of both, and the max of what i could afford. If anyone has a
Redi-Heater, they work great to heat up the pads so that they will conform
without protest to the beautifully irregular shapes within a bus :)

    The sun works as well... seeing as how the Q-pads are black anyways and
will heat up quickly out in the sunshine.

    Weeks prior, I used a quart of corroless to cover the floor of my bus
(all furniture removed)... after a week of curing, I slathered Kool-patch on
the lower floor (the corrugated part). Mr. Bulley was right... the stuff
smells nice. It was hard to get out of my hair, though... snipped a bit out
of my beard. Comes off great with a little brake cleaner, though OSHA would
have a cow.

    So this past weekend I started on the Q-pads... heat, peel, stick,
repeat... I took care of the complete rear of the bus... and started in on
the Kool-Patch... one coat to the inside of the rear... two more weekends
and I'll have my three coats done and feel happy about it.

    After you do this... you develop this odd habit of walking around your
bus &amp; smacking the panels repeatedly... the deeper thunk sound is
reassuring.... cathartic... veritably hedonistic.

    The pleasure that you will get from Q-padding your bus is easily worth
the $200-$300 it will take to properly Q-pad it...

    After all of this... I decided to knock out one of the doors... hammered
out the roll pins and popped it out of there. sandblasted the rusty spots
well, wet-sanded the whole door and rinsed clean/blew out with air... set up
the redi-heater to provide a gentle bug-free crossdraft and went to town
with the rattle can (my favorite: Rustoleum's white Refrigerator Enamel)...
this stuff gives you a finish akin to your refrigerator: glossy and hard...
good paint (somehow appropriate for a bus). After another hour in front of
the heater I moved it inside the house. It looks good enough for government
work ;)
