&gt; about these busses than most manuals contain. :) I am trying to figure
&gt; out what a ceartin replacement piece of the body is called. I have put a
&gt; picture of the actual part in question at
&gt; http://www.fament_dot_com/chip/inside.gif  . It is the part of the floor
&gt; that the lower latches for the doors go into. If you have time, please
&gt; take a look and tell me what it is called. Thanks

You should probably order a floor pan half from Das bulli, and
get the cargo door striker plate as well.  Doing the whole
half is reputed to be easier than sectioning, and the finished
product will look better.  If you have that much rust,you may also
need inner and/or out rockers, and then the inner strengthener
as well.
