I've been trying to do some research on bus glass, primarily rear corner glass.  I've been told that Sigla was used on all corner glass up until '62-ish, which means that Sekurit could have only been used 1 or 2 years as corner glass went away after '63.

Another source tells me that Sigla was the only corner glass installed at the factory, and Sekurit glass was only *replacement* glass.

My limited experience with glass is that Sekurit seems to be better glass, i.e. the laminate doesn't seem to bubble as much and doesn't seem to break as easy.

Any insights on corner glass and what is *correct*, just for curiosity sake?  I picked up a piece of Sekurit corner glass at Pomona and need another piece for the other corner.  Whether it's correct or not, if I can find another piece of Sekurit I plan on putting it in the 15 Window.
