I asked a question several weeks ago about replacing my camper pop top with a
canvas top and lowering the entire bus. I got mixed responses...some almost
condeming me of something evil, others saying both were impossible! 

For those interested, I've found Wolfgang makes a great lowering kit. The top
is simple bolt -in kit from Street Beat which fits the existing opening,
available in vinyl or canvas, and once and for all gets rid of that unslightly
box on my roof :-))

Flame suit on , shields up........
