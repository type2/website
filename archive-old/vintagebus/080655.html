Subject: RE: [VB] uneven idle

I'd check out the carb's idle circuit is clear/operating
first.....is the idle mixture screw having
any effect when you turn it? If not, there's
a blockage in the idle circuit.  Overchoking will mask this condition too.

Subject: [VB] uneven idle


I just purchased a '69 bus for my son, and I can't adjust the idle.
It's a 1641 engine just rebuilt with all new components, all standard
except that the PO said that it has a little bigger cam.  It idled OK
when we purchased it, but I think it was because the automatic choke was
always on.  After I disabled the choke, the idle became uneven with lots
of stalling.  I have set the timing and tried to adjust the carb.  It
will idle OK for about 10 seconds, then drop until it stalls.  I think
that the cause is the over-size cam, but I don't have a solution.  Any
ideas?
 
Thanks in advance
 
Jim
