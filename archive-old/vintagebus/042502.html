thanks andre,

I had heard that the POR15 was hard as a rock, but i had also heard of
people using the tie coat primer over the POR15 and sanding that... that
way the hardness of the POR15 itself isnt an issue as much.

But had not heard any testimonials or advice relating to doing so in a
visible area...

anyone? is it a bad idea?

thanks,

Steve
