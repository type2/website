Subject: re:cleaning rims

Thanks for the tips folks, I think I'm just going to leave them as they are,
get the tires mounted. Then next time I have some money-get them powder
coated. 

I will try the wheel cleaner at the local self-serve car wash-just to get
them to look clean. I don't want to waste the time painting, and have a
potential for adhesive failure.

The way I look at it-powder coating is the way to go, I can't afford it now,
when I can, just add what ever the cost of removing the tires, and then
remounting them.

I've just been concentrating on a few other things on the bus and my
squareback. I also think I'd rather spend the money now on getting some body
work done. The rust is starting to get pretty bad.

Thanks for the info.
