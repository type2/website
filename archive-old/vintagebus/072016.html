&gt; How does one pour oil into the stock oil tower without either going really

Hi Gene,
Kind of depends on what you are doing!  If you are pouring in a full quart 
then tip the oil bottle and in a swooping movement stick the neck of the oil 
bottle as deep as possible into the oil filler opening.  This way when the oil 
level in the oil filler passage gets so full, the oil from the bottle is shut 
off and can not come up and over the oil filler top.  Removing the oil dipstick 
is not going to improve things unless you are running a sand seal on the rear 
(FIF!) of the crankshaft.  If you are filling less than a quart you just have 
to take the time and pour slowly, and the colder it gets the slower you need 
to pour.  We have used the early 1960s tower type, Zelenda made baffle and the 
later louver type baffle with the same results.
