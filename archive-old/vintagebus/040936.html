&gt; how would they get there?  their unknown gear ratios, too small
&gt; tires, and all their gauges are confusing them too much for them to get
out of the
&gt; driveway!


Actually, I haven't been to the mideast since I was a teen (a bit longer
than I like to think it's been :-), but when I was there last (in Israel)
there were a fair number of busses.  You frequently saw white United Nations
bay-window busses with &quot;UN&quot; written across the side in HUGE letters (big
enough to read from from the air, I suppose), and there were more than a few
Beetles.  Then again, these may have represented the high end of the
automotive market, compared to the dometically made car, the Susita.  It had
a British made Ford Cortina engine mated to a mostly-fiberglass body.  Bad
idea!  In the mountainous regions of Israel there are wild goats, many of
whom consider fiberglass a delicacy.  Imagine filling out the insurance
claim for the damage to your car - - &quot;eaten by goat!&quot;  By comparison, a bus
may rust away over time, but at least chunks of it don't disappear in a
single afternoon. :-)
