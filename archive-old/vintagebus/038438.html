Subject: Original 66 Westy for sale


I ran into a guy this past weekend selling a 66 Westy.  It was in very
nice, unrestored condition.  Asking price is $2,995.  He said he had an
offer of $2500 but who knows what that means.  Anyway, the bus has only a
few slight problems, including some minor, shoddily-repaired body damage on
the passenger rear quarter (maybe 8&quot; wide) and a couple of cracked windows.
 The bus is white and has only minor rust - doors and floors are solid,
including the battery tray.  It is a non-walkthrough setup, front seats
look like they were redone with original upholstery.   The engine is a 1600
dual port, rebuilt, with 12V alternator.  I would appreciate it if someone
would also post this to the vintage list - I'm not on it.

Here is the contact info:

Keith Yarnold

Canadian, Tx.

That's all I know.  This bus would be an easy resto.
