The last I'd heard, the BDB (barndoor binz) had been covertly transported 
to the Washington state area, maybe to the Boeing testing grounds?  A few
civilians reported seeing it, but those reports are not confirmed and the
civilians were labelled &quot;crackpots&quot; by the government, and subsequently
disappeared under suspicious circumstances.

&gt; &gt;Did anyone ever get down to Area 51 and get spy photos of the elusive 54
&gt; Binz?  I have a special spot on my reserved just for such an animal!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Spot where? Is it irregular in shape?  Better get that checked out.  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; If by Area 51 you mean the RonnieWerks(TM) compound, I heard the government
&gt; consulted him about redoing Fort Knox security after I leaked the details
&gt; of the security surrounding his plans.
