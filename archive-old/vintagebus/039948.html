Kelly, good call on installing the wiring harness BEFORE the belly pans 
(grin)... Thanks, again, for your help with my &quot;project&quot;... (you'll probably 
be getting another call, or two, before we're finished)
I'm gonna be needing a set of your bellypans in the future so, that'll be at 
least one more call!
Adios,
Jon

&gt;I just installed one of Bobs harnesses in the 66 21 window in the shop,
Awesome quality, and a very easy install , belly pans are not installed yet&lt;
