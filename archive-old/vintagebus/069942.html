&gt; On my engine that came out of my bus, it has an original looking piece of 
&gt; sheet metal that collects hot air exiting the doghouse and routes it out 
&gt; through another original looking hole in the vertical piece of the front 
&gt; engine tin.

Hi Kevin,
That was stock on all doghouse cooled engines.  We found a strange seemingly 
factory made front DH engine tin where a round duct going out the front tin 
and is welded to the front tin!
