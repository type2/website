Subject: Re: [VB] RE: oil temp.

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I wonder whether there is a point where the engine temps increase faster
&gt; than the oil temp?

Head temps change instantly, oil is slow to react. Run head and oil temp
gauges simultaniously, and you'll see your heads can gain 50-70 degrees just
by flooring it up a freeway onramp, then see how much your oil temp changes.
Not enough to register usually. If you stick a big oil cooler on your
engine, you can overheat your heads while maintaining 180 degree oil temps.
BTDT.

This is why oil temp is not a real accurate way to tell if your engine is
running hot or not. I don't even run oil temp gauges anymore. Head temp is a
LOT faster to react to changes (instant) and is more critical. If you can
keep your head temps in line, you don't need to worry about your oil temps
in most cases.
