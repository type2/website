Subject: RE: [VB]Factory Tools (Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...)

&gt;

&gt;&gt; Is that the book whose content basically states something like &quot;You Need A
&gt;&gt; Tool Now? Here's what
&gt;&gt; it looks like and the dimensions... make it your self.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you PLEASE post that book on VintageBus?!?!  Or if anybody knows what
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about,
&gt;&gt; please post it.

This &gt;is&lt; on VBs website - VW tools of local manufacture.  What Ronnie was
talking about is the book of VW factory issue tools. THAT  would be cool to
have!  VW # US 803d= tool for framistanzing; here is a picture.

btw, 803d I have, I just forget what it does right now :)
