a few questions:
--is the shift plate in correctly now?
--did this problem start after, for some reason, you changed the shifter
itself? they are not all the same.
--is your front tranny mount broken? if it is, it'll be dificult to shift,
and feel like you're shifting &quot;through cement&quot;.
--is your clutch adjusted properly?
--is your FRONT shift coupler good? sometimes the grub screw(s) back off
and wear the shift rods. the grub screw(s) may      tighten up, but there
will still be rotational play between the rods.

these are a few things i'd check in addition to the previous ideas.

&gt; &gt;  I started having shifter problems, which I'll attempt to describe...  
&gt; &gt;  Basically, if you can get it in first or second, it's hard to get it in
&gt; &gt;  third or fourth.  If you can get it in 3rd or 4th, it's hard to 
&gt; &gt;  go back to 1st or 2nd.
