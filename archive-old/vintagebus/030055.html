There's a fella named Pat Tafta here in SC that built VW-powered
aircraft a coupla years ago... It's been awhile since I last went to his
shop, and I've heard he's gotten out of it because of liability
issues... 

Pat would cut VW engines in half and make 2 cylinder ultralight
airplanes with them. He had a very well equipped machine shop and a
foundry, and manufactured his own cylinder heads. He had several VW's in
his back yard.

The name of the biz was &quot;Christine's Aero&quot;, formerly &quot;Pat's Bug Shop&quot;.
Anyone ever heard of him?
