&gt; You guys rock. BTW, I went to Zearing in the fall and there was a guy from 
&gt; Colorado buying everything in sight. He was camping there. Hope he left 
&gt; that Blaupunkt I was eyeing alone!

Hi Bill,
That was a fun place!  Wish we could get back there again soon.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you have one of those darned repair clamped on to the cable battery
&gt; &gt; terminal?
&gt; 
&gt; I think. Does the super hot terminal indicate a bad ground? Could that 
&gt; hamper starting? I'm not tightening the clamps (I yank the negative off 
&gt; while it's parked as I'm sure there are shorts), could that be the problem? 
&gt;  Laziness?

That definitely does not help!  Though where a bad connection happens is 
exactly where one gets a great amount of heat from.

&gt; The carb is getting fuel so I'm sure it's an ignition problem. Could I buy a
&gt; universal neg ground from a parts store? Don't have time before the weekend
&gt; for BFY.

Sure, that will work.

&gt; One Mo thing. We had a big windstorm that violently threw my drivers door 
&gt; open. Now it opens too far and has to be slammed hard to close it. Nothing 
&gt; seems to be bent and the (check?) mechanism in the lower door seems to be 
&gt; alright. What gives?

Sounds like your hinges on that side got bent.  Check you passenger door 
hinges and compare them to the driver door ones.

&gt; Thanks again, E&amp;B!
&gt; 
Glad we could help.  Keep us informed on how it goes.
Eric&amp;Barb
