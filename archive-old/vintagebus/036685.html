&gt; I fear attempting to remove as im sure they have never &gt;been off in 
&gt; 37 years.  what am I in for? how should i best go about 
&gt; gettting the screws 
&gt; out...will they break? will where they are bolted in &gt;break?

The gates that I used for my '60 dcab came off the donor fairly easily ie.
15 mins with a heat gun(not even a blowtorch). This obviously shafted the
paint but I guess that if you are restoring that shouldn't matter too much.
