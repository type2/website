Subject: [VB] Rebuilding dizzies

The other day I finally managed to get sick of the loose, hesitating,
non-advancing distributor attached to the '67 Westy.  Laziness does wonders
for patience ;-)  The dizzy in question is a single-vacuum, dual-advance 
(SVDA, 043 905 205 A) that had quit its mechanical advance a couple months ago.
Vacuum advance was &quot;good enough&quot; so, lazy as I am, I let it fly.

Westies, however, are heavier and, with the poptop, even less aerodynamic than
a Kombi.  My bus also had a full subfloor (although compensated for somewhat 
by gaping holes in the front floor).  I started to lose patience, and rebuilt
another distributor.  A couple of questions from that.

I set the play in the distributor shaft by feel from handling a new 009: not
quite zero play, close but not binding.  Is there a feeler gauge setting for
this?  I'm talking about the play set with the shims at the base.

Lubricating the advance mechanism.  I dunked the disassembled dizzy in parts
cleaner, and then just oiled the shaft and put the requisite engine oil 'neath
the rotor.  The advance is beautiful a la timing light, but should I do more?

I'd like to reiterate my love of the Pertronix + CDI combo.  I swapped the
parts out (which had zero wear) from the old dizzy, and set it by eye.  
During the lifetime of the other dizzy, I _never_ had to reset the timing
and it really does run better.  The SVDAs are also good at removing any 
hesitation in your 1600DP, barring any other problems.  I have never payed
more than $10 at a swap for one (but check those vacuum cans!).  They pretty
much all need a rebuild (cleaning and reshimming usually good enough).
