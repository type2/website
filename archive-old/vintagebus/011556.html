&gt;The vintage bus list.. What are the applicable years?  Up to 71?

**It is supposed to be pre-'68 model T2's, though technically it is more
along the lines of &quot;upright&quot; engines.  I post questions but usually fail to
give the year of the bus or sometimes I lie.  I say I am working on my '69
Single Port upright out of say......my '58 Dbl Cab with original Safari's. 
You gotta stand out if you want answers....ya know?**

Secondly, it seems that there are a couple of ways to reduce oil/engine
temperature.  

1) Change the oil to straight 30w oil (I'm running 10w30 right now)
**Nope....the straight 30w will just not break down so quick.  Most folks
use 10w30 in Winter.  I hate 10w30 because it finds all my leaks.  I dont
drip a drop with straight 30w.  If you wanna really be anal, 20w50
Synthetic is what the Type4 guys use.  They say their engines were
&quot;designed&quot; to run that hot but that our uprights will burn up the oil at
those temps.  Well....kiss may _at_ss, but oil will burn at the same temp in
their engines as it will ours.  I do agree that the 20w50 Syn will last
longer.  I change my oil every 1k so I dont care if it lasts long.**

2) Add an extra sump/external oil cooler
**Yea......external works but beware where you place it.  You dont want it
to preheat the air that is cooling your cylinders.  Remember rocks bouncing
up and busting hoses and aluminum fins and crap.  Sumps leak....bad....no
one has figured out how to get em to stop.  Oil temp senders report
inaccurately and oil changing sucks....not to mention the time you lose the
whole sump by hitting a stump.**

3) Get the thermostat and associated flaps working
**on a brand new or rare engine......or because I wanted my heater to work
quickly....these are the only two reasons I would care.**

4) Rebuild the engine?&lt;
**V-dub engines are like motorcycle engines.....you can rebuild the
&quot;upper-end&quot; (ie: heads, pistons, &amp; cylinders) many times and never touch
the crank and rod bearings.  &quot;Upper-end&quot; rebuilds give good compression but
run hot.***

**Did I miss anything folks?**
