mic everything - if it is within tolerance, you have a usable part.
fussy guys will either a) get new, perfect tol part or
b) machine part to NEW spec and adjust other stuff accordingly :)

crank - if it mics w/in tolerance, the bearings will take up the rest.
furthur way from spec, tho, the lower the oil pressure/sloppier the end
play.
cam - if it looks good - not flat or too polished looking - it goes in.
don't forget to check for lash.

cam followers - ALWAYS get new ones if you can... lewis likes to reuse em
if they seem ok, but i had a used one disintegrate on my motor. course,
this WAS after 70K!!  REALLY check em... ANY flattening, pits or funny
looking stuff it goes out.

p&amp;cs - are a judgement call. again, mic em. if they seem ok, and you had
decent compression, keep em. slap is bad, worn rings is bad.
heads - valves should be done EVERY 30-50K no matter what. how far down the
range depends on how interesting you like life.
no cracks in the head, valves seem to be keeping their adjustment
(tightening up every time means stretching valve), keep em and start saving
for new heads or a rebuild. WATCH them like hawks, tho... like every 1000
miles check the valves.

case - check all the bearing seats w/ fingernails. any catches or ridges,
you should really line bore; the bearings have been pounding. otherwise,
its fine.
rods - check the play, there is  a spec in the bentley prolly. replace if
out of spec. these things can ruin yer day, so i would be cautious here.

i built a motor outta used parts; it would go 60 and get me around town
just fine, but dogged out on long runs, and i never trusted it on the
highway. it is now my emergency spare. has some obscene endplay, but works.

baby a used motor (NO keeping up w/ freeway traffic) and a half-assed motor
will last a while, it's expecting them to run like a solid rebuild that'll
nail ya.
