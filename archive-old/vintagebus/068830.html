Subject: Parts in Germany and Bad Camberg.  How are you getting them
  home????

No reply's to the last plee so here goes again.

I have found a few items in Germany that i would like
to buy.  Right now my contacts in Germany can not
help.  Does anyone have any contacts in Germany that
would be able to help me arrange to ship a few
items???

Anyone going to BC who might be stashing items to be
transported back after the show?  A container or
something like that????

Can anyone help????

thanks
