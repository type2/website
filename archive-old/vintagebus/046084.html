Hi Steve,
With keeping in mind that you are cheep, though hopefully not too sleazy.  
;-)  Best to just clean the engine case especially the case half sealing 
surfaces, and then bolt the engine case halfs together to proper torque 
specs.  Then call around in your area to local machine shops, and any VW 
repair shops to see if they have a dial bore gauge that they can measure all 
four (Especially #2, &amp;1.) bearing saddles at horizontal and vertical postions.
