Hi Clark,
The 40 HP (1200cc) was last stock for the N. American bus in  1963 model 
year.  In 1964 the 1500cc engine was stock and continued thru  1967.  1968-71 was 
the 1600cc engine.  The 1500-1600cc engines used  the same muffler.  The only 
biggie differences between these two engine  sizes is the diameter of the 
P&amp;Cs.  
  The 40 HP engine had much smaller P&amp;Cs AND shorter stroke  crank.  This 
shorter stroke allowed for a narrower engine, so thusly  slightly less distance 
between the head and heat exchangers openings in the  muffler.
  BTW in Europe and other markets the bus could be ordered  with smaller 
earlier engines as late as into the 1979 model  year!!
