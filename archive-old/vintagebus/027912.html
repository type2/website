Subject: Re: [VB] Weber 32/36 vs Solex 34

Hi, Michael,
I have one of those Weber 32/36 carb/intakes, but have not installed it,
yet, to try it out.  I got the setup cheap 'cause the choke was
missing.  It looks like it had gas in for a short time as the top gasket
is dried out and is sticking out in the bores.  The carb appears to be
identical to the Ford Motorcraft 5200 used on '72 and later
Pintos/Mustangs with the 2000cc/2300cc engines.  I was able to get a
complete choke assy for mine for $5 off a junkyard '75 Mustang that
bolts right up. The earlier versions of the Motorcraft use a water
heated choke assy, but the later models use an electric heater.  The
choke bi-metal spring from both appear to be the same. Larry's VW
Offroad Center has a good selection of small parts for the
Weber/Holley/Motorcraft 32/36 and has a partial gasket set ($9) I need
for the shrunk gasket.
