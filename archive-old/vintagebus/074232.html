Eye protection, gloves, proper ventilation. You know, I never think to mention
them because it always seems to be part of the job, but I guess there are some
that may not.

Thanks Clara

&lt;&lt; #1) Wear Gloves

I might have said this before, but do consider getting a box of latex gloves.
  It is really nice to just peel off the gloves and not have oil/scum on my
hands.   For the greasey jobs like a suspension lube I use the nitrile (blue)
gloves, as the latex gets soft and falls apart when all covered with grease.
Also nitile ones are good against solvents, like when cleaning a carb.   I
found nitrile gloves for $5 a box of 100 at Harbor Freight, and they are fine
for
people with latex allergies.

do use eye protection.  A couple years ago I got a piece of metal in my left
eye when grinding, it got past the goggles at a funny angle.   I was really
worried as that's my good eye, I have a blind spot in my right eye.    It
didn''t start bothering me until hours later.  It was girls night at my house,
and
we had kicked out the guys and were drinking Par de Sho:tz and watching Bandit
Queen and some other girl power movie and it started hurting and watering and
I was in the bathroom couldn't get the da^&amp; sliver out, even though I could
see it in the mirror,.  (there was a splinter of metal stuck in my eyeball)
when Chris came home and drug me off to the emergency room, and the doctor got
it out really quick (how'd he do that?) so it stopped hurting but watered even
more.  I was all hammered, it was pretty funny when they had me do the vision
test.   Anyway, it would have been bad if it did permanent damage.  Now I have
a face sheild.

When working with fumey chemicals for Pete's sake do it somewhere ventilated
so you share the fumes with everyone else (dilute dilute)
