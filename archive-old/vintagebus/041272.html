Interesting.... it really shouldn't work right. My understanding of the
gas guage circuit is this:

+12v-------------
		|-
		/-----
		\    |	
	    R1	/    V	
		\    |		
		|-----
		|+
		|
		/
		\&lt;----
	    R2	/	
		\
		|
		|
	       GND	
		


Where R1 is the internal guage resistance, and R2 is the sender
resistance. The gas guage itself should just be a basic voltmeter. So
basically what the gas guage is measuring is voltage across it's internal
resistance. Therefore, the equation for this is:

Vr1(voltage drop across r1) = Sv(supply voltage) * R1
                              -----------------------
				R1   +   R2

The interesting thing is: R2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;R1 most of the time.

In this case, R2 dominates the equation to some extent. For example:

Assume R1=1, R2=100(empty) -&gt; 0(full), 6v source for a correct 6v system

Vr1 = 6v * 1 ohm
      -----------	=   .06v	Full tank	
	101 ohm

Vr1 = 6v * 1 ohm
      ----------	=    6v		empty tank
	  1 ohm

If you change to 12v, but keep the 6v sender and guage:

Vr1 = 12v * 1 ohm
      -----------	=    .12v       ~1/2 tank
        101 ohm	

Vr1 = 12v * 1 ohm	=    12v	really empty tank
      -----------
          1 ohm

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen a couple posts now regarding this.  I run a 6v gauge in my 12v
&gt; car with no voltage drop at all.  The gauge works fine, it says full
&gt; when it's full. and empty when it's empty.  It does bounce around a lot
&gt; when it's about 1/2 full, but I attribute this to my sender unit.  I've
&gt; been led to believe that since the gauge only measures resistance it
&gt; doesn't matter what voltage it's using.  I'm no expert so don't flame
&gt; me, but I've been using this setup now for 3 years now with no probs.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I still have the metal parts of a westy Z bed.  The wood is gone,
&gt; but I also have the cushions.  Anyone interested? I live in Ventura, Ca
