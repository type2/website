After my last post I thought I should say something worth while:

Forgive my spelling I am typing in 26 degree weather:

Clutch, buy new. Or buy used like new, dont bother trying to fix.

I like the plexiglass idea posted earlier.
I didnt do it though. I used saran wrap. Purple plastic wrap to be exact. It
seems to be working. Looks kind of nice and kind of wrong and weird. Noise
the same but warmer so far.
