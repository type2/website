I have been trying to remember the name of the 
organization that is working to get some sense into
the smog laws, prevent unnecessary taking of old cars 
off the road, get rid of photo-radar, protect
the rights to own and drive our older vehicles, and
finally found it.  They probably have resources to 
help with the persistent neighbor trying to rid the 
neighborhood of your restoration projects, even though
they are out of out of site or covered.

From their webpage, http://www.motorists_dot_org/
The National Motorists Association is a membership
organization devoted to representing and protecting
the rights and interests of North American motorists.

This should cover a lot of ground on all four of
my vehicle email lists.
