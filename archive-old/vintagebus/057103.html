If you've nailed down and fixed all the leaks, it
could be shoe travel doe to break-in.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; My 63 crew cab is having some breaking problems. It
&gt; keeps &quot;gaining&quot; pedal. I've replaced the master
&gt; cylinder, brake hoses, and wheel cylinders on one
&gt; wheel that was obviously leaking. The other wheel
&gt; cylinders seem fine. Has anyone had this problem and
&gt; if so, can anyone tell me what the heck else I can
&gt; look for?
