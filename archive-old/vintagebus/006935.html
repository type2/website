Finally got the panel out of the Ryder truck, really a lot better then I
thought, the bummer is it's a January 1955 panel,
114 628, I was told it was a late 53 when I bought it, which would have been
a dream being todays my birthday and I've always wanted a year of birth bus,
the cargo floors are perfect and the right passenger is good and only the
drivers floor is rusted and the left rocker. Pictures to follow.

hey Everett looks like this is the earliest 55  out there? :-).
