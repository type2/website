hey all

on the saga of cleaing out my other garage (have you seen what a tercel looks
like with four bus doors stacked on top of the roof and the inside filled with
bus parts too??))

anyway does anyone have need of a metal bulkhead for a non walk thru bus (goes
behind the front seats) if yours has been hacked/modified etc. this is the
ticket

also have the metal &quot;heat tube&quot; thingie that goes under the rear seat on
passenger model busses . it is the thing that is welded to the floor and is
designed to distribute &quot;heat&quot; to the passengers. in pretty decent shape all
things considered.

both items are free for the taking provided you want to pay shipping from
toronto.

i would rather someone use them than send them to the metal recycling dudes...

p-mail if interested

michael
