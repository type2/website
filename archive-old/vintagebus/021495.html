It is a '67, but the trans isn't original.  Don't know if they used a '67
nosecone, I'll have to do some more looking in there.

&gt;  What year bus?  If you have a '67, or a bus with a 67 nose cone, or
&gt;  one of the brazilian nose cones, there will be a two-terminal switch.
&gt;  One lead goes to hot, the other to the light, doesn't matter which is 
&gt;  which.
