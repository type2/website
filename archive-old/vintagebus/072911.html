Subject: Re: [VB] Wheels are on E bay --- I got tired of haggling.

Stan,
We all appreciate the fact that you think of the list
first before posting these parts in other internet
sale opportunities.
But let's be a little objective.
Firstly, this is Vintage Bus list, not a Vanagon List
or even Type2 List &amp; those parts aren't really
suitable for most of the vehicles this list's
subscribers discuss here.
And secondly, on a more practical note, I looked for
those rims through the site map you put up as a link &amp;
couldn't find them.
If people won't pay your price, don't grumble, just
find another buyer.
You've complained about people messing you around with
orders before but it's the nature of the beast.
Everyone from folks who sell carrots by the side of
the road to huge firms trying to push major orders
through deals with a buyer's fickle nature.
At some point in time someone has to take a stand &amp; if
yours is to go for the price you stated then be proud
and stand firm.
But remember that discretion is the better part of
valour......one day you can tell everyone that you
held on &amp; got a great price for that part but for the
moment be satisfied with the knowledge that you have
what other people want but can't afford.
And also remember that the day may come when you
backed down over $30 or $40 &amp; the person who bought
from you will have something you need......whether it
be the funds to buy something big that you need to get
rid of or simply a very necessary part that they
possess.
But enough said.
Let's get back to enjoying our buses.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
Andy P

&gt; I offered these wheels at $350.00 everybody wanted
&gt; them cheaper.
&gt; Go bid them if you still want them.
