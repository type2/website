Subject: Leaky seals
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Last night I finished putting my transaxle and RGBs
together.  Put gear lube in, did some other little
thins that needed some attention.  Went to bed
figuring I would do the box install tonight.
   On the list to day someone gives the advise to get
4 GRB gsk/seal kits cause the quality of the seals are
suspect.  I think that sounds a little odd.  So what
do I find when I get home.  Thats right gear lube
leaking onto the floor.  So off I go to the parts
store to get extra gsk/seal kits.

  PS Charlie said use condoms, can I get your phone
number cause my wife will never believe me!
