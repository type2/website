I need that piece!!! Mine is missing from my '65 Standard w/Mesh gray
int. Does anyone have an extra? ...dumb question, I guess after seeing
this one, it will be up on eBay!! I do really need one, but can't
justify spending that dollar amount for one right now. If anyone has
one, maybe we could make a trade.. I have a nice little stash of NOS
wiper arms, and NOS dash switches etc...
