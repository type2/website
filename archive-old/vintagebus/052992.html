Subject: Re: [VB] problems installing rear window on double cab  help  help

Are you doing this now? outside? what is the temperature? I could not for
the life of me get a side window in my bus to fit. Would not to it. It was
chilly outside so I gave up. I went out the next when it was sunny and
warmer and the window went right in.
