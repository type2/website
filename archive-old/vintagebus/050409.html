&lt;&lt; After removal and inspection, I found that one of the mounting flanges
 on the cooler (the side with the single stud) was broken.  I have been
 to the archives, and have not found exact answers to my questions...  so
 here goes:
  1) Can I be absolutely sure that this was the cause of the leak?  Why would 
it crack there?&gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
No you can not be absolutely sure, but it is a good bet!  Stress from 
vibration, or badly installed.

&lt;&lt;2) Any notes of caution, words of wisdom, etc., before I buy another, and 
replace?&gt;&gt;
Yes, at least change to a doghouse cooler setup, or better yet install a type 
4 cooler inside of a doghouse fan shroud.

&lt;&lt;  There are 3 washers/spacers that mount between the case and cooler, 
correct?  2 seals...  Will these parts be included with my cooler purchase?&gt;&gt;
This sounds suspiciously like you have a dual relief engine case with an 
early small diameter inlet/outlet oil cooler.  The early small inlet/outlet 
oil coolers only will fit the dual relief engine cases with a special tapered 
set of green colored seals, and a set of three copper clad washers to go 
between the cooler, and the engine case.
FYI one never uses these copper clad washers for installing any other 
cooler/engine case combo.  We have installed doghouse systems on 40HP 
engines, and this would fit even on 25, &amp; 36HP engines with a aftermarket 
36HP style fanshroud.  Though only use aftermarket fanshrouds if they have 
the stock amount, and placement of directional fins spot welded inside!

&lt;&lt;3) This appears to be a good time to consider modifications to the cooling 
system.  Any thoughts? (I have already referenced the type2 library).  I live 
in the SF Bay Area, moderate temps, but the occasional trip to the Sierra 
through the Central Valley can be above 100degrees.&gt;&gt;
Take a good look at the type 4 in doghouse fanshroud, and a oilpump/filter 
combo is a good idea also.

&lt;&lt;4) The cylinders OPPOSITE the cooler are pretty dirty, and I can imagine 
this crud might diminish the efficacy of the cooling system.  Any advice on 
the best way to clean that area?&gt;&gt;
Dig most of it out with a long thin screwdriver, plug all holes into the 
engine, and then pressure wash the rest of the gunk out of the fins.  
Afterward make sure to change the engine oil before starting the engine.

&lt;&lt; 5) Should the relief valve assembly also be replaced?&gt;&gt;
Only if you have had lots of oil pressure problems, and have checked the oil 
pump for wear first.  You really should have an oil pressure gauge to see 
what the pressure is.  The aftermarket oil relief valves can often push oil 
pressure too high, and burst oil coolers, or blow forward crank seal!

&lt;&lt;6) Finally, I am considering options to decrease the noise coming from the 
engine.  Has anyone tried insulating the engine compartment with success?  
Will this make the engine too hot?&gt;&gt;
Too dangerous.  Too often doing this results in the insultaion getting sucked 
into the cooling fan!  Almost always the real solution is to rebuild the 
engine, and balance all of the moving parts.  Also check your RPMs you might 
need to get a higher geared tranny for the speeds you want to do on the 
highway.

&lt;&lt;7) My upper engine mounting bolts are held in the trans case by what 
appears to be a silcon material.  It barley holds the blot in place on the 
left side.  Any suggestions to keep it in place?&gt;&gt;
Well after 1967 there were notches in the case, and special headed bolts to 
lock them from turning.  If you tranny is a pre-1968 you can have some tabs 
welded onto the bolt heads to lock them against the tranny case from turning.

&lt;&lt;8) Anything else I should evaluate, maintenance I should perform or 
modifications to consider while the engine is out?  I know it's easy to 
remove, but, I would prefer not to do it every month!  &gt;&gt;
What width cooling fan?  What diameter lower pulley?  How does the throwout 
bearing feel, loose. worn out?  Are the throwout bearing fork arms welded 
firmly to thier shaft?  How is the thickness of the clutch disc?  At leasty 
7mm or preferably thicker.  Does the boden tube have the correct bend to it?  
Is there any wear on the clutch cable?  Does the rear end of the boden tube 
point right through the eye of the outer arm the works the clutch throwout 
fork?  Check your axle boots!  Tranny oil level.  When was the tranny oil 
changed last?  Unknown, or more than 20-25,000 miles?  How old are those 
cracking flex brake lines, and fuel lines?  Remember to replace the flex fuel 
lines about every two to three years to prevent a VW-b-cue, and do not forget 
to check often that you still have that forward through tin grommet for the 
metal fuel line to keep it from getting cut through.  If grommet is missing 
at the very least install a piece of flex fuel line over the metal line where 
it goes through the sheetmetal, and hose clamp it in place.  Beware of soft 
aftermarket grommets, the ones we tried only lasted a couple of days!
