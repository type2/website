For those of you that saw Eddie at the Octo show in
October (I think) 
and saw how freaking OLD he looked, I heard today that
today and he's turning...(drumroll)...46.
46?!?!  I would have bet big $ that he was well on his
way to 60 based on his looks that day
Poor Eddie...hopefully his new bus (if he bought one)
will help him age a bit better.
