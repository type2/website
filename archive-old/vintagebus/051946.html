Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Needed - Nixon Library

You will have to be there to find out

Thom transport and lodging fund is in the works. Private plane, helicopter
from airport, restored Delux to pick him up, a suite at the INN and a OG bus
to use for the weekend. Will that get you here?

ronnie

ps. you still have to pay your own registration fee and buy your own raffle
tickets.
