Hello All,

For those of you at BYOB and Kelley Park, I'm the guy with the doublecab 
with no bed in grey and white primer with a Sympathy Award.

So I was driving around in my 1962 DC today, and I figured I'd pull over to 
adjust the load in back.  As I stopped on the side of the road, I turned on 
the hazards and turned off the key.  Now here's the problem:  the engine 
kept running in time with the hazards.  It was keeping time with the click 
from the flasher relay.  Later, I tried to replicate the problem and noticed 
that it would only keep running when I had my foot on the brake with hazards 
on.  Also, only my rear lights work on the hazards.  I never was able to get 
the front lights to work right.

Second question.  I'm trying to recreate the gas tank cover area in the same 
DC, the area behind the rear seat pedestal, to keep the stuff under there 
from sliding around and hitting the gas tank.  I picked up two cover plate 
pieces at KP from a 1960 SC but one of my truck's PO's had cut out the 
center frame piece that these would bolt to (and everything around them as 
well) so I'll be fabbing the replacement supports.  I was looking at the 
parts manual at the obsolete air-cooled documentation project and found an 
exploded diagram of the DC, but no listings for those body panels.  It looks 
like the DC gas tank cover area is different than the SC's, being a one 
piece thing instead of two pieces.  Pictures of this area would be great, as 
I have never seen what should really be back there.

I know this is a long one, but thanks for reading,

Alex
