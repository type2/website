Subject: Volks Folks Reunion '98

There were a whole lot of very nice VWs in the show - Buses to
Brezelfensters to Bolfs, plus about 1500-2000 visitors.  You shoulda
been there.

My personal fave was a '67 pop-top Westy with a 911T engine and a full
roll cage.  The owner named it the &quot;913&quot;, but I called it bad craziness.
It was cool, and very well done.

Mark your calendar for next year &quot;Volks Folks Reunion '99&quot;, Sunday
October 17, 1999, at Fox Lake Park, Titusville Florida (they're gonna
party like it's 1999).
