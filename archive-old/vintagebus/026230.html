Subject: [VB] Oil bath air cleaner
Message-ID: &lt;38302D08.33EB129A_at_escape_dot_ca&gt;

Yeah!  Just got my new oil bath air cleaner from Thom - and of course it
is exactly as he discribed.  Thanks Thom.

I see I'm missing some sort of bracket from my engine compartment to
support the air cleaner - i thought it was supposed to be supported from
the top of my engine bay, but now i see that it is supposed to be
supported from a bracket that goes behind the coil? - no big deal, i can
fashon something till the right bracket comes along.

But what about these extra inlets?  What do i do with those?  My current
air cleaner, the round chrome thing, has an inlet on the bottom, or is
it the side, of it that has been pinched closed.  So there is the intlet
that is on the bottom of the snout - maybe 5/8 or 3/4 in dia - what goes
to this?  Then  there is the smaller inlet in the side of the oil holder
thing, prolly 1/2 or 3/8 or whatever - what goes to this?

Anyway,

TIA
