Subject: madera show this weekend
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,
Has anyone heard anything about the Madera show this weekend at the Madera 
Fairgrounds. Is this a good show to go to and would it be worth the two hour+ 
drive from the Bay Area to get there.

Is there anyone else from the Oakland/Walnut Creek area that is heading that 
way.

Keep me posted,
Dave Barnes
