Subject: Re: [VB] beware

Hi,

An old guy. I bought a rear decklid for a 67 (complete) for $1. And I 
got it in a timely fashion.

One guy I thought had stiffed me, had gotten in a motorcycle accident. 
After he was able to walk, he sent me the parts. Sometimes you have to 
be patient with people.

Conrad
