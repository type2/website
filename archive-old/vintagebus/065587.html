&gt; * I don't think this rear seat is correct:
&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2001871.JPG - it's reminiscient of
&gt; the flat seat that was in my '55 westy.  The bus came with another seat,
&gt; which is more like the one in my 60

Almost certain that is the correct one.  Looks exactly like the one in
my '62 (although the backrest seems a bit &quot;flat&quot;).

&gt; * what is this tube?
&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2001869.JPG

Like others have said its the heater outlet, but don't forget that there
is a plate that is installed over the hole/tube across the &quot;toe kick&quot;
recessed area.  I guess it was so things wouldn't fall in to the heater
duct so easily.  I took a pic of the one in my '62
