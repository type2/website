Yeah, I totally agree with Thom in saying that the Classic was boring
after OCTO.  I was disappointed that I couldn't find any decent ribbed
bumpers or correct tail lights for my '57!  I found some NOS front
bumpers, but my bus isn't that nice to put NOS parts on!

I'm bummed that I didn't know about the meeting time at OCTO.  I guess I
could have talked to Thom, but oh well.

BTW, party at Charlie's house after the Classic was unbelievable!!!  Where
else can you go to see a Cinama bus, ladder truck, sunroof Standard
barndoor, 409-mile '57 double-door, and the *nicest/earliest/lowest
milage(17,000)* original 23-window barndoor in the world all in the same
meeting place.  And those listed were just a fraction of the busses there!
Just going into the attic of his garage made the entire trip!

Anyway, the Classic weekend was everything that I had hoped for, and I'll
be there again next year for sure!
