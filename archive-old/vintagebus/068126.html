Subject: Re: [VB] drag link replacement

I got lots of great advice from the list several months ago... Here is 
a synopsis of the response.

Leave the pickle fork for making pickles out of parts.

I first tried the tool from JCWhitney, but wasn't impressed with the 
design vs. price (even though it is only $10). Its performance was 
lackluster in my opinion.

Two resellers, Pelican Parts Inc. and Samstag Sales , sell a seperator 
that is similar to the original factory tool - both suppliers price the 
tool similarly at $46 and $42 respectively.

A variation on the original theme is available that uses a fulcrom 
method to apply more force to the ball joint stud. You can also 
purchase this tool in the UK through Machine Mart and on the internet 
through the Tools Warehouse .

This is the one I got and recommend it:

A tool that is not designed for ball joint separation, but can be used 
for this purpose, is a gear puller. A small size gear puller can also 
be used to remove the pitman arm. Its flexibility in design makes it 
adaptable for various sizes of ball joints - rather than being a tool 
specifically for this purpose. This tool and most of the tools (and 
variants) mentioned above are available at the Tools Warehouse .
