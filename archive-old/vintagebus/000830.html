Importance: Normal

Evon, Haley, and I will be at the Great Blue Heron Music Festival in
Jamestown, NY this Friday thru Sunday.  It will be one-month-old Haley's
first weekend Westy camping trip, but her second long trip in the Westy (the
first was to the Furthur Festival in Virginia last week).  If you don't have
holiday weekend plans I'd highly recommend the fest.  Over 100 performers
with a huge variety of different types of music, from folk to rock to
bluegrass to world music, plus dancing, crafts, a swimming lake, and much
more, with camping all weekend.  Always a fair number of Westies in the
camping areas. http://www.servtech_dot_com/public/gbhfest/. A similar event is
in Ithaca, NY the last weekend of the month, http://www.grassrootsfest_dot_org.
We'll be in a blue '89 Westy with a side tent and screaming baby, if anyone
wants to stop by.

The Bus Depot will be open today in my absence (with limited staff), but
will be closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
