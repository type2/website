&gt; There is a 53 only and a 53/54.  I've only seen 1 53 only, it's on 
&gt; the bookshelf
&gt; of a lurker listee.  

maybe he would be a $300 kind of seller

&gt; Another listee had a '56 parts book at BBBV, I'd never seen that 
&gt; one,  awesome condition too, pardon me while I 
&gt; wipe the saliva off my shirt.

please please please 
I just don't see paying Bentley his price for the wrong book
all i humbly ask is for a tattered, greasy &quot;59 (through 62)&quot;
I promise to use it and not drool all over it or my shirt :-p''&quot;
sometimes you guys...you'd think it was the Bible that 
Bush(s) and George Washington put their hand on during inauguration.
(flame bait)

to the guy who p-mailed me asking me about 
where i found the info on the OG parts manual...
Lets keep it on the list please.
sorry to be so anal
but as a member of the vast right wing conspiracy 
and as bible thumping fundamentalist,
i belive in exposing of those things done in private
(rev. Jackson, EX pes. clinton)
things done in secret will someday be made known
to all you lurkers cherry picking the list
where is your conscience?
what good is all your hoarding doing yourself 
and the rest of the ACVW community?
will you take your booty to the grave?
(end of rant)

mahalo
