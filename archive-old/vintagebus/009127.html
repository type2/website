 I have emailed Dave to pmail me copies of ballots. My own reasons, no one
elses. Congrates to Bill B. on re-election. Want to keep all above board,
and can't wait till our first board meeting ( hopefully all can meet at the
VW Classic this year, maybe at Rich Yost's house Fri. or Sat. night.. or at
Kelly Park.
