Subject: RE: [VB] a new engine vs rebuild

experience: although dual port, and the promises of running cooler, they
have smaller valves and dished pistons, lowering compression and decreasing
air flow. they were designed for the mexican fuel injection systems,
similar to the 70's us model design. i worked at a shop that sold these,
and didn't have any major problems with them except 1.  the cam was
installed 1 tooth off, but that was easily fixed.  they were mostly
installed in bugs, too, so i can't comment on bus performance. you could
get a quality rebuild with new parts and &quot;normal&quot; flat-top pistons and new
&quot;regular&quot; single or dual port heads.  but hey, there is no guarantee that
anything will last long if abused, overstressed, or improperly maintained.



&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; i was wondering what the pros and cons are of rebuilt engines and new
ones 
&gt; from mexico. i talked to a mechanic today who said that the rebuilds he
gets 
&gt; are garrenteed for 12 months or 12,000 miles. he said that new ones are
only 
&gt; a few hundred dollars more? i just assumed the new ones were the better 
&gt; option? any advice? experiences?
