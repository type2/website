Subject: [VB] compression test results - OH NO - now what!


I did a tune-up today and received bad bad news.  3000 miles ago compression
test results were about 110 lbs all the way around.  Now #3 is at 90 lbs and
1, 2, and 4 are all at 100.  I guess problems are in the stars.  So what
should I do?

Well, I can tell you what I have been doing for twenty five years that works
everytime. At 500 miles I pull the engine, do a full retorgue, change oil,
and check all lines again, including that pesky fuel line from the tank. Of
course you have already adjusted valves, changed your engine compartment
seals and cleaned all the contacts on the starter, voltage regulator, coil,
and battery. Pop it all back in (hopefully new clutch and throwout bearing
is OK), and that should be that. Gene used to say, &quot;I build a great engine,
I know, because I check it at 500 miles.&quot; Sounded good back then, still
sounds good. My 1600dp in thumper is going strong and working hard hauling
stuff after 5,000 miles. 125lb on all cylinders. If you notice #3 going
down, you are overheating and heads are loosening up. Check your torgue.
