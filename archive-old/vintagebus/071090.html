Subject: re: axle boot doesn't fit

&quot;Thanks for the info, my 67 SC has totaled boots and need replaced

Well, Ray,
 I've just been informed that the &quot;B&quot; boots are no longer available. The
general consensus on making the &quot;A&quot; boots fit is to soak them in hot water. I
tried it and it does work.

I filled a stock pot half-full with water and heated it to just before
boiling. I then carried it out to my garage and dropped the boots in. I let
them soak for about 10 minutes. This softened them up enough to stretch. I
quickly dried them off with a towel, applied some permatex gray to the seam
channel and ends, and installed them. So far, so good. No leaks. Though, the
engine is out so I can't tell you how they do after cruising around for a
bit.

Search the archives for &quot;axle boots&quot;. There was (still is?) a review going on
as to the best brand of boot. I had ordered mine before I discovered this, so
I got what I got.
