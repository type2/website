Make your own.  Take a piece of metal tubing.  I think I
used a section of a handle off a cheapo floor jack after 
it reached the end of it's lifespan.

Use about 3-4 inches.  Cut a pair of opposing slots in the
tubing so it fits over the wings.  If this is made longer,
you can grip it with your fist too.  Then take a 3/8&quot;
square drive tool and fit it into the other end of the
tube.  Take a hammer and smash two opposing sides of the
tube to conform with the square drive tool.  This can
then be driven with any sort of ratchet, extension, or
whatever.  Choosing a tube diameter close to the size
of the square drive eases the fit.  As always, file off
sharp edges for safety's sake.

Jeff   Bussless but not useless
Any standard sunroof busses for sale out there?

&gt;   They make a nice tool that fits over the wing nut

Cool! Who's &quot;they&quot; and where can I find &quot;them&quot;?
