&gt; On friday I'm leaving from Springfield, MA to drive
&gt; my precious 71 Westy to
&gt; &gt;Colorado Springs, CO.  This is my first trip over a
&gt; couple hours that I'm
&gt; &gt;taking my baby on, and I was wondering if anyone
&gt; had any advice for me.  Any
&gt; &gt;tools/parts that may be essential to have, and also
&gt; any veteran knowledge
&gt; &gt;that may help me out on my way.  I'd love to hear
&gt; some responses!

Go to the archives, search _spare parts_, near the
bottom Thom Fitzpatrick has a list thats pretty
through. The only thing i can see he missed is the
&quot;Emergency Beer Stash&quot; :)
