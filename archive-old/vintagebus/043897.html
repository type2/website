&gt; All this talk of disc brake conversions for our splitties is getting me
&gt; curious.
&gt; 
&gt; The main points to talk about are - 
&gt; 4. effect on wheel base width (while retaining wide five)
&gt; 5. any other tid bits.

Since no one else has responded I'll give it a shot...

My split has the wheel adapters, I don't like them. The adapters increase
the distance from the contact patch to the pivot point of the wheel. So,
if the wheel hits a bump the moment it produces at the pivot is much
greater than the stock setup. Because of this it has heavier steering
(very heavy when combined with a Grant steering wheel, that is not much
bigger than a salad plate--hope to get that stock one restored soon), and
sever bumps tend to wrench the wheel from your hand =8^O

Also, my wheels (185R15) rub on the doglegs at full lock. It is lowered,
but if the adapters weren't there they would clear easily.

I suggest avoiding adapters.

Anyone know how I might put the stock wide five wheels on the T3 rear end
thats in my bus now? 

P.O.'d at the P.O.
