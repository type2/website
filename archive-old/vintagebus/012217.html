Was Upper Kids

     This is very long, and sometimes redundant.  Please read it
nonetheless as it will end all questions for early crew cabs.  Thank
you for your time.  Please write back for any extra clarification.
     I own a 1959 crew cab pick-up.  In my pick-up I have the rear
seat that came from the factory according to the original owner.  The
front seat is a full bench, and the rear seat is a full bench.
     The drivers(frontseat)  backrest is exchangeable with the
passengers(backseat) backrest.  I can go out to my truck and take up
to one full minute to completely remove the drivers backrest and
replace it with the passengers backrest then vice versa.
     The drivers(frontseat) bottomrest is exchangeable with the
passengers(backseat) bottomrest.
     To give background for those who may not know, the bottomrests
are supported differently.  The drivers bottomrest is connected by a
thick metal rod in the seat frame to the body with a u-shaped metal
catch(those with an early split window bus, or have seen one close,
should understand from looking at their own seats).  The front of the
seat frame rest on the body supported by four 1/4 inch thick rubber
stoppers riveted to the body.  Many of these are missing on busses
today.  This is where the 3 inch drop in the seat frame is that some
have already mentioned.  Yes there is a 3 inch drop on the drivers
bottomrest.
     The passengers bottomrest is connected by a thick metal rod in
the seat frame to the body with a u-shaped metal catch(those with crew
cabs or have seen one close should understand from looking at their
own seats).  This metal rod in the passengers bottomrest is not the
same rod as the one in the drivers bottom rest.  This difference is
because of the storage space under the crew cab's passenger(backseat)
bottomrest.  There is a thin removable metal seat support in the rear.
 The front of the passengers bottomrest rests on four 1/4 inch thick
rubber riveted to the thin removable metal seat support.  This is
where the 3 inch drop in the seat frame is that some have already
mentioned.  Yes there is a 3 inch drop on the passengers bottomrest.
       I can go out to my truck and take an unknown amount of time to
completely remove the drivers bottomrest and replace it with the
passengers bottomrest then vice versa.  I say an unknown time because
I have not performed the modification myself.  When I had my seats
redone, and they were apart, the upholstery guy wanted to know where
this weird bus seat came from.  I said what do you mean, and that's
when we both learned about the interchangeability at the same time.
     So for those who made it this far, a re-cap.  The drivers and
passengers backrests are easily exchangeable.  The drivers and
passengers bottomrests are exchangeable after exchanging the metal rod
that connects each to the body.  For those of you who own a VW crew
cab which is missing its rear seat.  Borrow the thin removable metal
rear support, and have a metal working person copy it.  Borrow the
rear seat metal connecting rod, and have the metal working person copy
it.  Then you have a rear seat.
     Again, Backrests no problem.  Bottomrests require modification of
each depending on where they will be installed.  Possibly, The Old
Volks Home could produce a kit, when you provide the seat frame, or
any other of you entrepreneurs.  Thank you again for your time.
