Subject: Parts Needed

I just replaced a wiring harness on a '63 Single Cab.  It went in well and I
am looking forward to getting it on the road.

I need a few electrical parts and hope someone or a few listees can help me
out:
dome light switch - the one that mounts on the left side of the speedo pod
5 wire turn signal switch
floor-mounted hi/lo beam switch
headlight relay
blinker relay

Please let me know what you have and give me a price.

Thanks for your help in advance.
