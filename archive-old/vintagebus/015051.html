Hi Volks. I have posted some more pix to my site of the neat features of
my '64 I presume EZ Camper. For now I'm looking for a front bumper for
this baby. I think I found the rear already. Am willing to pay shipping
within US.  Also, there was someone here before from Europe that was
willing to swipe the headlight units for American style units. Still
willing to do it? Write me if interested. Take a look at my site as I
will post pictures there as soon as I make any progress on the resto of
my beautiful '64 &quot;Savana&quot;.
Link is here and I hope that I got it right this time:

PS It looks like my '64 was born the same month and year as me. Hope it
was the 9th of April 1964. I can't really say for sure since the M-code
plate is missing. Should I write the factory? Address?
