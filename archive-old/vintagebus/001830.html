&gt; A waste of bandwidth - NO - wasted bandwidth is all this crap that I get
&gt; about Walmart or Ebay - or the bashing of my fellows ;).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ah well, that's my dream -
-------------------------------------
Tongue (for the most part) in cheek. :-)


I also had a dream.
I have a dream that one day  this Vw. bus nation will rise up and live out
the true meaning of it's creed:
&quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all man are created equal
&quot;.
I have a dream that one day all Vw. bus owners will be able to sit together
at a table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day the state of Ca., a desert state, sweltering
with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis
of
Westy tents and buses with owners off all different origins living together.
I have a dream that one day my two children will not be judged by the length
of their hair or the color of their buses but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream that one day the vintage bus list, whose govenor' lips are
presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will
be transformed into a situation where little hippie kids children and red
necks'  children will be able join hands and walk together as brothers and
sisters.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day all ebay posts will be on Friday.
I have a dream that all toy posts shall also be on Friday.
;-)

Free at last !
free at last !

ps.    &quot;My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of libery, of thee I sing.Land
where my fathers died,
land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring. &quot;
