Saw this ad:
1954 VOLKSWAGEN VAN, all original, runs good, $1500, 205-491-9670,
Bessemer, AL

It was actually a '58-59 Kombi, was just wondering if anyone on the list
picked it up, sounded pretty original from the phone description...
The guy has a '64 Hardtop Deluxe, for sale, too, thus the mix-up.

That was cruel but I had to do it, it's Friday!  Flame me via p-mail, if
you so desire...

Bye,
