&gt;How come my dad
&gt;says that they are hard to heat in the winter?&lt;

All,

I would put any Vw bus heater w/o a thermostat up against any watercooled
vehicle w/o its thermostat.  This is a very common misconception.  As Mr.
Bob Hoover says, &quot;Lets compare apples to apples!&quot;

Man....I hate it when people rag on perfection.....
