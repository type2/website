Hey Volks

A couple of years ago a fellow in Zimbabwe wanted me to find a buyer for a
67 RHD double-slider panelvan. Listee Matt Henricks was interested, but I
think the asking price was too high. Do you still have the pics Matt? Can
you scan them?

Apart from its interesting double-slider configuration, this bus had special
high-level engine vents, similar to, but not the same as those on Australian
buses.

Anyway, while filing stuff last night I came across the m-plate infor for
this bus. I will put it in the vintagebus registry, but here it is for all
you minutiae collectors:

VIN# 217098040
M-Plate:
212  240
411  010  012  156  162  175
RH 2166 131383 7098040

212: ??? something to do w/ walkthru/nonwalthru???
240: Low compression engine
411: ??? Rhodesian specs?
010: Dust filters for passenger compartment
012: ???
156: Larger air cleaner
162: Double sliding doors, panelvan
175: Bumper overriders

RH: Export code for Rhodesia
131383: Pearl white over Pearl white, mesh grey interior
