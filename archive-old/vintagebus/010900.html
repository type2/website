Hi Rex,
First do take all of the shifter apart to clean and grease all moving parts.  
Replace the forward shift bushing if you have a 59 or 60 and later bus.  When 
you take out both the engine a tranny do take out the rear shift rod out the 
rear of the bus and replace both rear shift bushings clean and regrease the 
rear shift tube and replace any torn dust boots on either end of this tube.
To adjust the shifter you need to make sure the reverse lock out plate is in 
it's proper position.  Do check the shop manual for this position, but from 
our memory it should be with that reverse lockout tab forward and on the 
right.  Bolt everything together which will probably take a helper to hold 
the parts up from underneath while you thread in the bolts from the top.  The 
main thing to keep in mind is that any movement you do with the shift rod is 
reversed underneath!  In otherwords if you shift forward to get first gear 
the lower under part of the shifter and the shift rod are going to the rear.  
Same goes for the left/right movents also!  So in otherwords if it feels like 
you are not able to shift forward enough to engage first gear you have to 
loosen the bolts and shift the base of the shifter to the rear.    Eric&amp;Barb
