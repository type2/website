hmmmm.
It's 12.96 in every Wworld I visited between Fresno and OCTO. There are sets with jet skis on the trailer in a similar sized box for 9.96. Wonder if the Mercedes list is scooping up their combo? Would they pay more on E-bay for a model of their $50k vehicle? 
Karl listee found 1 in Fresno, I found 2 in Bakersfield. 
Anybody know the secret inner workings of a Wworld? Do they have extra items out back? I was recruited to run the computer system for a new distribution center about 60 miles south of here 6 years back. Didn't take the job or talk to them in depth. They may have a JIT system that ships only what's needed, centralizing the warehouse duties instead of having Shorty in the back losing and mangling products. Just need to find the beer bar the super-Shortys hang out in and have 100 sets shipped to my local Wworld.....

A dilema solved. Wanted to sell my 21 window that I haven't touched in 2 years, but decided to move it to the local metal-wizard for extensive repairs, like the entire left side replaced from the windows down. Absence will make the heart grow fonder, will be ready to work on it in the spring.
