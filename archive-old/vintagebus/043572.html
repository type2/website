NQ,

If you have the money, you might invest in a copy of 
&quot;Desktop Dyno&quot; a computer program that let's you adjust
engine parameters and see where the torque and hp come out.

I have used it extensively when trying to decide what to build and
found it to be a fairly good measure of what to expect.  I started
out by putting in(as closely as I could) a stock engine configuration
and then seeing if it matched some of the specs for a stock vw engine.

It matched failry well and I then went on to change the stock
configuration and see how it affected hp and torque.  

It is really meant for the big v8 guys, but I got what I considered a good
feel for what certain engine changes meant in terms of hp and torque.

The best part is being able to plug in the specs for different cams
and see where your hp and torque go....extremely interesting!

I picked an engle 100 based on how I was going to drive and the top
rpm that I wanted the engine to &quot;see&quot;.  I am very pleased, even though
I run 1776 with engle 100 and heads almost the same as yours.

The next one I build, I am going back to 87's and an old 3/4 race 
cam that I used long ago.  Stock heads and stock stroke.  I drove
one like this many years ago and could turn in the 15's on the
drag strip and still get 33mpg with a Holley bug spray.

Read the dyno results from all the tests in the HVW and magazines,
listen to how people feel about their 1776 or 1910 or whatever and 
then make a selection.

I personally like where the torque falls from the engle 100 and 
don't expect my 1776 to ever see over 5,000 rpm.  Plenty of umph
left at 75mph! 

As the man said....there is almost no substitute for more cc's...

Your mileage may vary&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; After discussing engine theory with Lou down in Havasu and driving a
&gt; couple of healthy 1776 engines (John Howard's and Ronnie's), I've come
&gt; to the conclusion that I need to do some immediate changes to my bus
&gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, I'm tired of my engine puking oil.  I will solve this
&gt; problem by listening to the advice that the list told me way back when
&gt; and get rid of the Melling pump and switch to new stock.  Next off, my
&gt; case that Painter's Grinding did a 60/80 cut on (why in the hell a
&gt; reputable place would consider boring a case out that big is beyond me)
&gt; is either going to be replaced with a new case or one of my used ones
&gt; that I will have a reputable machinist and good friend in Lincoln look
&gt; at.
&gt; 
&gt; The other change I'm going to make is to get rid of my CB044 heads.  I
&gt; never told the list this but I had more power and snap with the stock
&gt; heads and even with the leaky cylinder.  I'm thinking of going back to
&gt; the Engle 100 cam but can anyone tell me what the difference between the
&gt; 100 and 110 are?  I think that the 100 would be more of an &quot;RV&quot; grind
&gt; where the torque is induced at lower RPM.  These are things Lou and I
&gt; discussed and after driving Ronnie's 1776SP with 100 cam, I know for a
&gt; fact his bus would simply blow mine away.  My power comes on way too
&gt; high and this really shouldn't surprise anyone.
&gt; I'm thinking that a head that has slightly bigger valves would be the
&gt; ticket.  I keep hearing that 041 and 042 heads are junk so is there a
&gt; head out there that is a little bit better than stock or would a set of
&gt; 3 angle stock heads work for me?  I tend to think that opening up the
&gt; ports mildly would help but the 044's are just too big and I've lost my
&gt; port velocity at lower RPM's.  I think I've finally learned something -
&gt; the velocity through the ports is important.  If you open up the ports
&gt; on an engine that doesn't have much displacement to start with, then the
&gt; power comes on higher.  Maybe I'm stupid but it seems to be making
&gt; sense.
&gt; 
&gt; The T4 project is still in the works - I haven't given up on it at all.
&gt; I just need to get a bus ready for a road trip that runs dry (no leaks)
&gt; and fixes the glitches that are bugging the daylights out of me.  Every
&gt; trip I take peppers the backside of my bus with oil and I'm losing it
&gt; out of the OP sender hole with bunged threads.
&gt; 
&gt; So I think I can get away moving my parts over to another case by doing
&gt; the following:
&gt; 
&gt; New bearings for the cam and crank
&gt; New or good used case (with the align/thrust bore that is within
&gt; reason.)
&gt; stock oil pump
&gt; sell off the CB heads for a set of good stock or mildly improved heads
&gt; (the CB heads have a little over 3,000 miles on them and I'm willing to
&gt; trade straight across for the heads I'm looking for.)
&gt; new gasket stuff and aviation permatex the case halves together.
&gt; New cam if the list things a 100 would work better.  The 110 I had with
&gt; stock heads sure had a lot of snap though.
&gt; Since the engine runs so cool, I'm thinking of bumping compression up a
&gt; notch like 7.1 or 7.2 instead of 6.9
&gt; 
&gt; I know all this engine crap of mine gets old (tell me about it) but I'm
&gt; thinking of doing a road trip this summer and would at least like to
&gt; have a bus I could trust.  Right now, I don't.
