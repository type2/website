Subject: Re: engine won't shut off

Done.  New rubber fuel lines, I am using a cord grip to pass my fuel  
line through the engine bay bulkhead instead of the rubber grommet,  
as I feel better about it.

took half the day off today.  tightened brakes up, adjusted drag link  
so I can look at  the speedometer without x ray vision to see through  
the steering wheel spoke, mounted front and rear bumpers, welded  
exhaust pipe and tip onto muffler (much quieter now), checked the toe  
in on the front tires (1/8&quot;) and chased some tail/brakelight gremlins  
around.  I was ready to take the bus in for a safety inspection right  
at 5:00 when everyone closed.

I'm still getting used to driving a bus. Having the front wheels  
under my butt,  and the pedals directly under me instead of out in  
front. I've got long legs, so getting in and out is also an  
adventure.  One thing that takes no adjustment at all is adopting  
that hunched over posture needed to rest on the steering wheel.  That  
just feels like home.

Soon, we get inspection, registration and plates.  Then I can start  
driving places other than my neighborhood with a sharp eye out for  
the man, and get the interior in!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Short answer: With some help from Matt Roberds and
&gt;&gt; Ronnie, Got it all figured out, and drove the bus
&gt;&gt; for the first time yesterday evening.  Nice!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good deal!  Thanks for posting back to the list with
&gt; the solution; it helps everybody calibrate their advice
&gt; to the next person.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now I've got to tackle all of the crazy things I
&gt;&gt; discovered once I got it on the road (adjust drag link,
&gt;&gt; brakes, accel cable sticks a bit, clutch needs to be a
&gt;&gt; bit tighter, aim headlghts).  Does it ever end?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You may have done this already, but: it can end in a
&gt; hurry if you don't replace the RUBBER FUEL LINES.  If
&gt; your Bus needs all of the above, it probably needs the
&gt; fuel lines replaced as well.
