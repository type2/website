Well... the Camper conversion has found a home in San Jose with someone who 
will no doubt cherish it and is planning on restoring it for use.  To the 
others I am sorry there weren't more of them laying around.  I will let the 
new owner post their good fortune if that is their desire.

I am still looking for a rear deluxe bumper.... Red Barn anyone?
