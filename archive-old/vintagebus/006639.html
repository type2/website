Subject: Anybody want a Yellow/Gray Sundial Tent
Date: Tue, 9 May 2000 07:56:19 -0700 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


  If anybody out there is looking for a Yellow/Gray Sundial tent, I know
where there's an original unused one for sale, the seller wants $500.00 for
it, I have a standing offer of $350.00 for it but some Japanese fellow
offered him $500.00 (but didn't buy it) for it so he's mentally stuck on
that price. It has all poles, bag and sides.
  It is located in So Cal and will be at the OCTO Show and if it doesn't
sell there it will be at the Classic.

Anybody have a used red striped Sundial tent for sale??? I need one for the
other side of my DD.
