There's another bumper avenue not yet discussed: the door
holders used on fire trucks and other vehicles.  I bought
a set of these _at_ OCTO - they're a aluminum pop-out prong
that mounts on one door, with a rubber receiver for the 
body (or is it the other way 'round?) and holds the door
*open*, so it doesn't flop around in the wind, or try to
close when you're parked on a hill.

When I get my digicam, I'll take some pix.
