&lt;&lt; When did the pocket stop?  I've got a '62.  Pocket or not? &gt;&gt;

I found a pair of brown and white door panels with pockets in the attic 
yesterday.  They are in pretty good shape.  Also had a few other panels from 
the same bus.  Would rather sell them than move them.  I think they were from 
a '59 +/- a few years.  Pmail if interested.
