Gang,

I have a set of the WW panels which I haven't installed yet, but *have*
coated the rear porous side and all edges with POR15 in preparation for
the install. i am waiting for a break in the never-ending search for some
proper colored vinyl (the platinum color) to finish them off with. They
are currently in the garage, and have not warped even with the moisture on
damp mornings. 

Maybe you should coat them as I did - I can't imagine water penetrating
the POR.
