i don't know, this really turns me on when rachel gets all dirty and
greasy.  i like her ripped up jeans. i just built shelves in the garage so
we could both have more room for parts.  the tings mentioned don't bug ME.

&gt; I dunno why you guys whine about the wives.  Men tend to have a real low 
&gt; tolerance for a woman with greasy hands and jeans,  and dislike me
boiling 
&gt; engine parts in the kitchen, washing my greasy hands there and complain
about 
&gt; me bogarting the garage.   Like I could park my old bus with no paint out
in 
&gt; the rain.  As if! and why are these old VWs taking up all the places to
park?
