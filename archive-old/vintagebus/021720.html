Hey list
I've got a nice set of painted original Porsche 914 (fuchs)alloy rims, caps, 
lugnuts, and studs (fit on 68-79 type 1's and 3's) I'd like to trade for a 
sloped or regular westy woody roofrack for my bus or other nice bus parts (og 
safari's/middle seat/ribbed bumpers/cool accessories, you name it)... I'll be 
at BNNTA and don't want to ship the rims so if your going and wanna 
swap---that'd be a good place to do it!!!
I've got a few other parts I might bring If interested... ('59 front bumper, 
aprons (1 crankstart), Rear seat caramel brown kick panel...)

Lets talk!!!
Take care-Pete
'59 panel
'74 super vert
