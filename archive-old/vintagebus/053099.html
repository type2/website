Subject: M code 002? Z bed Q

On the subject of M codes, my 66 DLX has a 002, a preheat flap delete.
Does this only entail the air cleaner is missing the flap? Or is the
heat exhanger, hose, tin different? I was considering the tin would have
a plug (it does) the heat exchanger would not have the extra riser, and
the tube and flap on the air cleaner would all be missing...


Also do the aftermarket Z bed kits that use the stock seats function
with the DLX heater log?
