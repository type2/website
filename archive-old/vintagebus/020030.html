Well, if you call Thom's phone number there's a message about 
recruiters. I guess in the tech field you're always on the lookout 
for another job.

But, I didn't know that Thom had already found his calling.

I just picked up a T34 Ghia at Kelly Park to be my alternate daily 
driver. It lived in Sacramento, so I contacted Thom to see if he 
could pick it up and hold on to it for a couple of weeks. He gladly 
took care of things (even put in new gas and tuned up the carbs so 
that now it idles) which I fully appreciate.

Then he sent the pix...sure there were the couple of the Ghia hanging 
out around the vintagebus_dot_com panel. But there was a gem in there. 
Thom has found a new occupation, as a cover model. I thought everyone 
might like to see his latest portfolio piece.

Enjoy!
