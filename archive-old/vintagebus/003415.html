The reason that engines run cooler at lower mph is that the load goes
up witht the cube of the speed and the cooling ability only increases
in direct proportion to the engine rpm.

&gt; &lt;&lt;  On both drives to Kelley Park and Sac Bugorama,
&gt;  my Berg temp dipstick would turn the light on if I sustained speeds
of 65mph
&gt;  or faster.  If I slowed down to 55 and stayed there, the light
would go out
&gt;  and stay out.  But driving 55 seems to defeat the purpose of going
the type1
&gt;  route for lower Rs on the highway.  It has also crossed my mind
that perhaps
&gt;  the Rs are too low thereby not turning the fan fast enough at given
freeway
&gt;  speeds but then why would slowing down cool it down.  I've backed
the timing
&gt;  off some with no difference but want to fiddle with it some more as
well as
&gt;  check the air/fuel mix.  I'm interested to find out if it's the
phat motor
&gt;  that makes the difference too. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It is my belief that there is a cooling curve.  Meaning that the
cooling
&gt; factor goes up with rpms (fan going faster) until a certain point.
At that
&gt; point the heat generated by the motor and pushing the bus along goes
up more
&gt; with rpms that the cooling does.   Meaning that there will be a
speed/rpms
&gt; which does the most cooling.   This probably varies depending on the
set up
&gt; in each bus somewhat.
&gt;
&gt;  I have found that my westy runs coolest around 2600/2700
rpms,(~50-55mph in
&gt; this bus) and higher temps at higher rpms.  It has a guage, not a
berg
&gt; dipstick blinky unit, so I can tell the differences before it starts
&gt; overheating.
&gt;
&gt; Found a similar situation in another bus which had a completely
different set
&gt; up (that one was lowered and had a big motor) - that buses highest
cooling
&gt; rpms was 2600, bus when the outside temp was resonable it would
happily
&gt; cruise at 70 or more without blinking.
&gt;
&gt; Lower geared buses would seem to have an optimal cooling rpms which
would be
&gt; at a lower road speed, therefore if your bus had lower gears seems
you would
&gt; need to slow down even more to get that light to go off.
&gt;
&gt; Had driven at different speeds on flat road steadily till the guage
stayed
&gt; still, then switched a couple hundred rpms and stayed there till the
guage
&gt; settled, etc, to figure this out.
&gt;
&gt; would be interesting if someone else with guages would post their
findings
&gt; about oil temp/speed/rpm interactions.
