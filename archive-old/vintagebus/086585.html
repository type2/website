Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Leak

Seth,
Is the new oil pump of the same size as the old oil pump ? It should
be (don't ask me how I know...)

Did you use an oil pump puller to remove the old oil pump ? Inserting
tools between the pump body and the case is leak prone.

Did you install the two gaskets properly ? One between the pump and
case, one between the pump and cover.

Is the pump torqued to spec?

Is the pump cover true / flat ? Did you use sealant on the nuts ?

Best luck - Arnaud
