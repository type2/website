Subject: Re: [VB] Rheostat wiper control

I had one in my dormobile, it didn't replace the stock switch, it went in
line after it. So it had an extra little black knob on the dash. one of the
companies with a 2-3 page ad in hot vw's had them at the time. It was awsome
for winter driving in the NW.



&gt; &gt; JP found a stylee rheostat switch you could put in your12V VW w/  6V
wiper
&gt; motor, then you could have adjustable speed wipers!!!!  think you have a
non
&gt; stock wiper knob though.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on a part number or where to get it?
