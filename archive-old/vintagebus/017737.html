Well, just got off the phone with Hagerty Insurance, and full coverage for my 62 double cab with an agreed value of 9K is only $87 bucks a year!

Beats the hell out of the 20th Century policy I had it under which was well over $200 a year with only liability.

Like Tom mentioned the only restriction was a garage and 5K a year max.  Hey I consider my Price Club cover with vinyl  sides a garage ;-)
