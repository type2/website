Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Question

&gt; &gt; I already know that the used trans came out of a bus. What I don't know
is
&gt; &gt; whether it has a bus center section or a bug center section with a
reversed
&gt; &gt; R&amp;P.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; The only way to find out is to take it apart or at least turn the input
shaft
&gt; so many rotations and count the rotation of one of the wheels/axles while
the
&gt; other wheel/axle is locked up somehow.  Then figure out the tranny gearing
&gt; ratio.
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;

Actually, I learned a bit of tranny trivia today from Rick Long at Long
Enterprises. The third and forth gears in a bus trans has a groove machined
into the edge of each tooth running perpendicular to the length of the
tooth. These were the only pre-IRS gears made with a groove.

You can see third gear by taking the drain plug out of the bottom gear case.
With the plug out, look or feel inside the plug hole for the groove. If
you've got the groove, its a bus third (and most likely a bus forth). No
groove and its a bug third ( and most likely a forth).
