Subject: [VB] Rear wheel bearing oil seal excitement
Date: Mon, 22 May 2000 04:06:27 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

On Saturday I replaced the rear wheel bearing oil seal on the driver's side
of the Kombi.  It sprang a leak and make quite a mess on the wheel driving
home Friday, so I decided not to risk driving it to the show the next day.
Darn.  Got a new oil seal kit (thanks Dave!) and fixed it up.

On tearing it all down, I noticed the axle had slight push-pull play.  I
think I remember this being a &quot;bad thing,&quot; and I was worried 'cuz the
history of the driver's side box is unknown (pass. side was fairly recently
gone through).  There was a seal in the kit that was _not_ sitting in my
bearing cover.  It was a large o-ring (about 3&quot; diameter) that seemed like
it was supposed to sit in the wide inner (towards the gearbox) rim of the
bearing cover.  So that's where I put it, and I'm kinda wondering if that
was a good idea.  The reason I question it is that another o-ring was not in
the kit that was on my spacer ring (kinda in between the small o-ring that
slides over the axle to the bearing and that big o-ring in size), so I had
to reuse my old one.  There was also a big flat washer that had no place on
mine, so I didn't use it.  So I'm missing one o-ring and I've got an extra
washer and big o-ring.  And when I torqued the cover bolts down, the play in
the axle was gone.

I'm hoping the play is gone because I torqued down the cover bolts correctly
(45 ft/lbs).  I'm worried it may be gone because of the extra o-ring.  The
tranny makes no new noises, and after 150 miles of driving at an average
speed of 60mph there's no leakage.  I checked to see how easily I could turn
the axle by hand when I noticed the play was gone, and noticed no difference
from when there was play.  What do you think?

And while you're reading, I'm wondering where to find a kit that has that
middle-sized o-ring I was missing.  I probably shouldn't count on the old
one being good forever.

A side note, the big 46mm nut came off far too easily, seems like it was
just over finger tight (but with the pin)!

Torque, torque, torque!
