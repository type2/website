If they are truly 100W lamps they will draw 7.7A at 13V.

I've run some of those &quot;hot&quot; 100W high beams and note two things.  Make
sure that they are made by a reputable maker and have a ceramic (not
plastic) insulator.  I have had cheaper 100W H4s overheat and ruin the
headlight connector, right before melting their own internal connections
and failing.  Not fun.
