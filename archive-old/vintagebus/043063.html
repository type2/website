Subject: [VB] installing wcm door rubber
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.3.96.991226124741.14916A-100000_at_slip-3.slip_dot_net&gt;

The rubber I am replacing was incorrect so I am uncertain about how to
install the wcm door rubber. From what I can tell from thier diagram, the
moulded part faces the car and the flat side faces the door for all pieces
except the lower front piece. The piece that looks like wood trim. For
that piece the flat edge is against the body, the wider edge to the front
and the skinnier edge to the back? Can anybody tell me if I am correct.
Also any tips would be nice.

Thanks,
Josh
