I've been fielding problems from AO-Hell users who 
suddendly found that they could not post to the list.
Turns out that the new &quot;Easier to Use&quot; 6.0 will
ONLY do html email, according to one listmember who
took the time to deal with their tech support, and
from discussion on the Porsche list.

So, if you wish to post to the list, you will NOT
be able to do it with 6.0 at this time.  AOL told
this listmember to use 5.x instead.

If you have any questions, please contact me off-list.

Thom
