Subject: Re: [VB] '64-'71 TypeII beam wanted&gt;Phx AZ

And I am wanting to do the exact same thing!! but here in Nebraska so if
anyone in NE/IA/MO/KS/SD/CO/WY/UT/ID/MT/Canada? has one and is coming
through here before late July bring it please!  Also I don't have a big
Nutter tranny and want one of those too!  After Late July I will be in
NE/IA/MO/KS/SD/CO/WY/UT/ID/MT/Canada? and can pick it up there!  I know that
there are a few of us Midwestern Bussers that want to go toward Glacier
National park before the Colorado shows on August 9th and 10th and than hit
those shows on the way home like we did last year!  and the year before!  If
any one is interested in meeting up with us somewhere on the road (last week
of July and first in Aug) please let me know and We'll try
Ellis??

&gt; Now that it's incredibly hot in Phoenix and makes no sense to work outside
I am
&gt; gearing up to work on my '63 EZ Camper. I have a Big Nutter tranny to
slide
&gt; into it but am trolling for a large brake front end.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone in the SoCal/AZ/NM area who might be coming through Phx this summer
is
&gt; encouraged to contact me in this regard.
&gt;
&gt; I am also entertaining a balljoint beam with discs as a possible upgrade.
&gt; Willing to make adjustments to recover stock splittie height. I might
adjust
&gt; back to go up! =) Drop spindles need not apply. If you are going low and
want
&gt; to junk that stock height shight well then dump it here! I intend to do up
a
&gt; SouthAfrican off-roadermobile hamshack. BFGoodrich here I come! =)
&gt;
&gt; Please Pmail me at ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com Reasonable prices only please.
