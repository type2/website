that bites.

do check your oil pressure relief springs.  I am sure this has been mentioned 
in re to your oil cooler footballs.     Check them check them check them.  
make sure you have stock springs, not the heavy duty ones.  Make sure they 
have not been stretched out.   Yes 20/50 is too thick when it is 40* in the 
morning.  What kind of oil pump do you have?

I have a typeIVdoghouse on my AE case (large oil passages)1600 in my bus, am 
running 30wt castrol, it is 25-40*F  in the morning, and when I first start 
up the bus the oil pressure is 50--60psi at idle.     It shortly drops down 
to 40, but has to warm up to get a more reasonable oil pressure than that.  
This is normal for this time of year here, and I have not had problems.  Not 
sure when sie pump it is, but it is not one of those heavy duty ones.  I 
think if your oil pressure is over 90psi that is when you get over-pressure 
problems.

Check your oil pressur ereleif spring (s)
