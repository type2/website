Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Valve Gap!

the gap should be .006 on intake and exhaust with stock aluminum pushrods,
but also if you have steel pushrods it should be about .002 to .003. intake
and exhaust. And of course always set them with the engine cold. The reason
for the larger gap with aluminum rods is for the larger expansion from them
when they heat up.

.006 both intake and exaust. Used to be .004 intake, .006 exaust but the
general consensus is that .006 works just fine.

	Can someone tell me what the valve gap should be on a 1600dp
engine?  I want to run down and get a feeler gauge I have seemed to have
lost mine.





Thanks,
