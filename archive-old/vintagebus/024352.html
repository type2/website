Subject: RE: What Ever Happened to Will Wood

Robert,
I kind of lost touch with Will last December after a we had a small
&quot;issue&quot;, but I'm told by another local VW nut (Tim) that he was moving
from Utah. This was last summer, he was headed back to California, if I
was told correctly. I think he was having a rough time, but was in good
health when Tim talked to him.

He had quite the collection (keeping the weeds down), and I imagine he
unloaded the parts mobiles, but I hope he hung onto his double-cab, his
wife's bug, and his '61 convert (sweet cars).

If you're out there lurking, Will, I could still use a rear fender for
the bus!

pd

&gt; I'm hoping Will just got busy and had to get off the list as opposed to something no quite so pleasant.  I always considered Will to be one of the list *elders*.  I hope everything is fine and he's still active in the VW community.
