Hi list,
I am in the midst of rebuilding my first motor and am running into a problem 
(other than the shop taking four weeks to get my heads done). I'm at the case 
mantling stage, and when I torque the case perimeter hardware, the crank gets 
harder to turn with the rods. It is fine when I torque the two small nuts by 
the flywheel and the six big ones, but torquing the outer ones seem to bind 
things up a tad. I can still spin the crank with the rods, but there is some 
initial stickiness, and the idiot book says to stop if any binding happens. I 
took the whole schmutz apart once already, and didn't find anything wrong. 
Any ideas on what's up??
