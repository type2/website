I think it's because hippies are basically slow to start with,
what with all the strange chemical reactions going on.

OTOH, when you shove the dipstick in, you have to give the
fluid time to climb the dipstick, kinda like sticking a knife
into pancake syrup (better analogies had sprung to mind, but
this is a family list).  

You didn't say if they all had the same brand and viscosity of oil and 
were all checked at the same temperature, which has much more relevance 
than the make and coachwork modifications.  When I check the oil
on my 1955 westfalia european camper complete with tent, kph speedo,
semaphores, NOS headlights and campbox interior, I do it
warm, and check a couple times in a row, letting the stick sit
for a few seconds before each reading, to make sure that my
freshly-painted dove blue hatch top westy with really nice seats has 
the amount of oil I think it should.  Then I drive on in my
super rare bus and don't worry about it for a while.

The number of miles on that batch of oil will also affect it's 
viscosity.  Nasty old oil flows better than clean new oil.

You should be checking the oil with the motor warm, but after it's
sat a little to let it flow back down into the sump.
