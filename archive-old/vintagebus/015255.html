I've been noticing a trend in automotive lighting: everyone
wants bigger, brighter headlights.  It's like an arms race.
I was at the FLAPS a while back bying a 9004 for the 911,
and everything they had was n% brighter than anything else.

The new dilithuim crystal beams on the newe BMW/Mercedes/Porsche/Audi
are INTENSE - too intense.  They blind you across 6 lanes of freeway.
Sure, the *driver* of that car can see just great, but after he passes
going the other way, you feel like stevie wonder during alunar eclipse.

And don't get me started on daytime running lights.  Grrr.

It doesn't appear that many people - headlight makers included -
have given any thought to the other side of the coin: the super
bright lights screw up everyone elses night vision.  Like an arms race,
others have to go out and get brighter lights to overcome 
Mr Calalysed-Neodymium-beam blue-light special.

And the SUV's, which have to be n feet off the ground, which 
puts their headlights right in my back window on the 911, and dead
smack in my mirrors.  Sometimes I wonder if it's a F*rd Excursion 
behind me, or am I about to get abducted by aliens.

Yeah, it's one thing when you'r eout boondockin, and you need to
see, but do you really need that much candlepower in downtown metro?
I've heard some european cities actually don't let you use your
headlights in town at night.  And France has those cool yellow
headlight bulbs (I have a set, need to find a use for them)
