You can also try to find a recycler where they have dismantled a restaurant 
or fast food place and get the work table tops to put on the bench.  My 
brother scored me a couple of these about 4-feet long that have a raised 
side along 3-edges and are stainless... very cool.  Helps to contain the 
oily stuff from working on car parts while preserving the table top for 
other house type projects for your young lady, if you have one, which do not 
necessary like oily work surfaces.  You don't attach them just put them up 
on the bench when the job calls for it.  They lean against the wall nicely.
