 The current owner thinks the rubber floor mats encourage condensation and
thus leading to rust under the mat.  I'm not so sure.  What says the list?

Hi,
99% of the rust there is caused by not using sealant between the rubber and
glass and between the rubber and frame.  Just using new seals will give you
leaks in about 6 months.  We use roofing tar for our buses for two other
reasons.  1. The roofing tar is the only sealant that we know of that will
reseal when the sun comes out if you really knock your VW around from
offroading or just bad roads.  2. The roofing tar repels rust even if water
sits there.     Eric &amp; Barb
