Subject: euro taillights

I have a nice pair of OG euro housings I'd sell for $65. If anybody is
interested I could send pictures, they are from a 65 bus. I also have a
complete pair of matching euro headlights from the same bus for $200. The
headlights are mint. I'm also willing to do some partial trading for CE
or OG safaris, short sunroof tracks, barndoor horn button, middle seat
wing nuts, full length roof rack ( yeah, I'm dreamin : ) , painted front
emblem ( not dinged ), good 15&quot; bus rims, shift rods for a 61, rear
window jail bars for a 21w, or ???? anybody interested ?
