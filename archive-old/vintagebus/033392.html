There has been some talk the last few days about the paper gaskets used for
the oil strainer/plate.  But I'm surprized that no one mentioned 'reverse
dimpling' the 6 holes in the plate.  Over time the cap nuts will pull the area
around themselves up forming a high spot which, in turn forms low areas
inbetween that don't squeeze the gaskets tightly enough.  I don't remember
where I read about this but it was many years ago and I always check/correct
for this at each oil change.  All you need is two ball peen hammers and a
concrete floor.  You hold the ball end of one hammer on a 'high hole' and
strike it with the other hammer.  The object is to level the sealing surface
of the plate giving you a better (more even) seal.  Works for me.  Now if I
could get all the rest of the leaks fixed......
