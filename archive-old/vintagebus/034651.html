 Hello everyone,
   The Bus as I said is a '67 camper, but it is
 not a Westy, the top is a Hanover, the interior
 is Gone. There are only a few beatup items left
 of the old interior. The Top is real nice and I....

   This leads me to the next question. Has anyone
 build there own camper interior? Do you have any
 pic's? I don't think I will be able to find any
 Hanover interior parts, so I ill be building my
 own and want to see some custom built stuff so I
 can plan out my own. I would love to see good and
 bad, so I know what to and what not to do. I'd
 like to do something in a Birch or Oak
 plywood(cheaper and lighter than the real stuff).
 As for the sink and stove(if I use one) I will go
 with modern RV store or salvage stuff.
   I will also need a rear bumper, don't need the
 over riders. Are the '67's the same rear bumper
 as the '68-'71? I know the brakets on the '72 are
 different, but the bumper is the same as '68-71.
  &gt;&gt;

1.  no idea on the top you have

2.  Dont have pics, but different camper kits I've had include the full so 42 
westy (the cabinet on door is very useful) a riveria which had copied the 
concept from so 42 westy (cabinet on door very useful)   Also have had a 
platform in the back behind the back doors for a bed  THis one was just up to 
the rear cargo door, and though many people said, isn't that bed short?,  I 
didn't have a problem., also that extended  with or without hinge to make a 
hidden storage under neath.  Or just an so 42 westy Z bed in the back.  You 
could take a Z-bed and widen it to make it full width bench/Z bed.    Also a 
homemade kit, that is really hard to explain, but makes a lot of cabinets 
including one behind the driver with a pad  behind head in case of whip lash, 
and drawers you have to lift to open, but though that was okay as a camper, 
it was difficult to move large object in there.  Anyway, you can make really 
nice panels with 1/8 inch birch veneer, just think abot which way the grain 
goes before you cut.

3. rear bumper- through 71 will fit, but the bumper blade is different.  yes 
I have put a bay window bumper on a splitty, better than nothing.  THink a 
bright white rear bumper makes you more visable at night, safety safety.  
After I painted the bumper for my westy, I was told it was so much more 
visable.
