&gt; I went over those pics with a fine
&gt; tooth comb...considerable incorrect or molested items
&gt; and details...either it is original paint and had a
&gt; bunch of detail work done and incorrectly I add...or
&gt; it has been redone all together and being pawned off
&gt; as original, 

I know the bus well, the current owner and the guy who found it in 
Italy. I've seen all the paperwork and documentation relating to it 
(including a personal log from the original owner concerning every part 
he ever had changed on the bus!) There is paperwork corresponding to 
all the options fitted on the bus. Honest. I can see why it looks 
unbelievable though, but it really is genuine. Should it be in a 
museum......?? Possibly, but it's great to see it out on the road! 

&gt; Also that paint just looks too fresh to me...I have
&gt; owned several low mileage all original vehicles
&gt; anywhere from 11K-40K original miles and even with
&gt; spectacular paint they do have a certain &quot;patina&quot; to
&gt; them.  That paint looks almost right outta the
&gt; gun...if the paint was that nice I can't see why so
&gt; much other stuff was detailed.

Just some good polish. Look closer (perhaps not visible in the mag
pictures), and there are stone chips on the front panel, the odd small 
ding - this bus is used!  But, original used. 

Yes, the tent has been repro'd by the current owner (perhaps the one 
thing the bus didn't come with!) But it's made to a correct pattern 
from an original (cost about 600 pounds sterling I think) and does not 
detract at all. He needs a tent because he uses this bus to go camping 
all over Europe. In fact, it should be at Hannover for the 50th 
Anniversary event.

&gt; Anyhoo...it is a very nice bus!

It certainly is!!
