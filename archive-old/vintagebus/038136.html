&lt;&lt; I just replaced all the wheel cylinders and brake hardware including the 
shoes but my front passenger side cries out in a high pitched shrill voice 
when I brake fairly hard at the end of a stop. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
Definitely you need to just wear in the shoes and this requires adjusting the 
brakes two if not three times in the first mont when ever you install new 
shoes.  If the noise does not stop after the shoes are worn in you might need 
to champher the brake shoes ends to a 45 degree angle.   Eric&amp;Barb
