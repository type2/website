Trust me - I've been to Dan's house/garage/bus ranch and it would be all too
easy to start missing stuff.  There is literally just that much stuff there.
Heck, even half the big droors in his toolbox are full of just rare and hard
to find bus parts.  It was always fun having to &quot;search&quot; for a tool in his
box (or so he thought!) hee hee hee.... :-)  (I just had to look...)
