Subject: Re: [VB] External Cooler revised

I did run a little experiment with my 65 deluxe a couple of years ago. I
blocked off one corner of the engine compartment with a sheet of
aluminum.  I cut 2 small holes in it for fans (mounted on the engine
side of the aluminum).  Then I mounted an 8-pass oil cooler on the other
side of the sheet.  To enhance airflow, I used plastic scoups on the
vents.  The scoup on the oil cooler side was facing rearward and the
other forward.  What can I say, I had too much time on my hands!!  The
result was that the engine oil temp was less with no oil cooler at all!

In fact, the only time it ran cooler was when I removed the decklid
altogether!  Even then it was only 5-10 degrees.  

Thankfully, the only cost involved was the aluminum sheet.  I had one
stock engine (no cooler) and one 1641cc with cooler.

Strangely enough, with the stock motor and the decklid removed, it ran
the coolest.  Of course then I spent hours cleaning it after a Baja surf
trip!

&gt; Has anyone on the list tried using an external cooler (located in the
&gt; engine compartment) cooled by a electric fan? If so what was the
&gt; results? Was it cool enough or not? Did you have to make any duct work
&gt; for it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Rocky
