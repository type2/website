&gt;&gt;Would this help to keep the brights clicked on.  I have the bright
&gt;&gt;in the turnsignal switch so should I start there.  When I raise my
&gt;&gt;signal layer bright click on but will not stay engaged.   
&gt;
&gt;Sounds more like a nine prong relay problem or possibly a wiring 
&gt;problem to this.

Not sure what the original question was but it looks like the
nine-prong relay doesn't have anything to do with the high beams -
just the turn and hazard signals.  The high/low beam switching
for '66 and up does use a relay, but it is only a 5-prong ('66)
or 4-prong ('67) relay, at least according to the '63-'67 Bentley.

I don't know if this is a &quot;latching&quot; relay or not.  In other words,
does the dimmer contact turn signal switch have to be continuously
&quot;made&quot; to switch it to high beam, or is a momentary &quot;make&quot; at
the turn signal switch supposed to cause the relay to change states?

If the relay is supposed to be latching, but only goes to high beam
when the turn signal is held, the problem is probably in the relay.
If the is not supposed to be latching, and only goes to high beam
when the turn singal is held, the problem is probably in the
turn signal switch.

If this wasn't what he was asking then please pardon the rude
interruption.  :)
