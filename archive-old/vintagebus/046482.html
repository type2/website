&lt;&lt; i have a 69 bus that has a doner engine + tranny if possible. i would like
 to take out the rear end of my 69 and put it into my 60. does anyone know if
this is possible. &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
The engine sure.  The tranny is longer and from what we hear requires body 
modification to fit it into a pre-1968 bus.  Almost anything is possible for 
the right price!   Eric&amp;Barb
