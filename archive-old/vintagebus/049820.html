&gt;Another caveat, one which I myself fell into: those NOS accessory
&gt;plugs that are being sold, for &quot;westy lamps&quot; and spotlights, etc -
&gt;they're $9 at wolfsburg west...

OTOH, you can score some good stuff sometimes.  I just got a pair of NOS
Hella headlight units from a guy in Germany.  He sold five sets of them for
$150 per pair.  Wolfsburg West get $150 EACH for them.  I'm satisfied.  Now
I just need some 6v H4 bulbs...
