Subject: Re: [VB] Reno Air Races

What a great idea!

This particular splittie driver used his vacation and worked intimately over
various years providing supplemental medical triage and CFR (crash / fire /
rescue) communications as an amateur
(ham) radio operator on the flight line every year for about 10 years
(...not bad for a &quot;commie hippie pinko,&quot; as the phrase went and still
sometimes goes, eh) -- until I no longer had the opportunity to do so in
that capacity.

Having no interest
in instead languishing in the bleachers as a program-grasping ticket buyer
(as much, far much more is happening than the spectator ever experiences), I
haven't been back since to the event I loved most about the Reno area, since
the participatory aspect and the public safety aspect I had excelled at was
supplanted by other concerns.

But a bus event... hmmm!

My questions are: where would you have the bus'es convene (as it's pretty
congested on-site re parking)?

Would this gathering, then, be held residentially?

And by &quot;flight path,&quot; do you mean west of the runway (Silver Knolls area) or
east (Lemmon Valley)?

If there's not time to get this thing together for this year (races start in
just a little over a week from now), there's plenty of time for people to
schedule time off for next year, and I would most assuredly be one of them.

As I've said, I haven't been out there for a while, only because I really
couldn't stomach just being a spectator after being in the thick of things
for some time.

But being a spectator among fellow splittie drivers, that'd be different!

Thanks. This is a really cool idea.

Craig Ayres-Sevier, N7CAS
