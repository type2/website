&gt; OK, I got the '66 Camper a new carb and now she purrs, well, &quot;rumbles&quot; might be the more appropriate word!  Anyway this bus has a 71 engine in it (I think) and the engine looks exactly like the one in my 71 Super beetle except for the position of the little plastic fuel filter.  I suspect the one on the 66 bus is in the wrong place, but I want to confirm this fact before I go changing it.  On the beetle the filter is on the fuel line between the fuel pump and the carb, however, on the bus it is located on the fuel line between the tank and the fuel pump BEFORE the line enters the fuel pump.  Which of these is right\wrong.  My bet is that it goes AFTER the fuel pump BEFORE the carb, but I want to be sure.  And if it is in the wrong place, is this likely to affect performance at all??

Those little plastic filters between the pump and carb aren't all that
good of an idea.  They can break and douse the sparking bits of your
engine with gas.  They aren't all that good of filters anyway.

Better to use a larger filter mounted under the bus.  LEss danger and
better filtering.  You can even get spin-on gas filters if you're so
inclined.

George, who wonders if I could find one of those nice sediment bowls with
a drain like my dad had on his 'ol tractor?
