Subject: German Bearings?

I tried BAP for new German front bearings for my 62.
They claimed they're not avaialable, and only have
Japanese.  I am *not* putting Japanese bearings on 
my bus, unless it really is the only choice.  I did
get FAG inner bearings.

Looking for the driver side grease cap.  If I knew how
to punch a square hole, I could modify a passenger side
cap.  The speedo is working right now because the cable
is epoxied to the cap :-)

Also, I wonder if my question about hydraulic lifters
is inappropriate for the vintage list.  I either have
hydraulic lifters, or I have funky rocker adjusters
and valves that are deathly tight and won't adjust to
.006...

Adjusting the valve train is one of the things I enjoy
about having a vw.  I may have to put in stock lifters.
Doesn't that mean different valves, springs, rockers, 
and pushrod tubes?  

Perhaps I can get a good close-up photo so someone with 
experience can tell me how bad my situation is.  I figure
the worst case is to replace the heads, which might be
timely anyway.  These heads were put on in 94, and it's
had a lot of miles since then.  Seems premature, since they
do work real well.


As ever, advice is welcomed.


James
