Subject: Re: [VB] Sound deadener, was  Re: [VB] Urethane tranee mounts

Hi Seth,
Tar seals out water AND repels rust.  So using it to seal the  edges of the 
tar sound deadening pads hopefully would help.
  As for using any plastic type of undercoating, if any rust gets  under this 
material the plastic coating turns into a green house like structure  for it. 
 The rust will suck moisture under the coating due to capillary  action and 
form vein like tunnels of rust under it.  Until the rust spreads  and 
undercoating bubbles off....
