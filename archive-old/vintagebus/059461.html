Subject: Re: [VB] Where to cut to make SC truck

Ric,

Cut just behind the B-pillars. I suggest you use OSB or even marine 
grade plywood for your conversion. You can tear the headliner out of 
the bus and use spray adhesive to attach it to the plywood to 
creative an all weather protective coating.

&gt;My efforts to find a &quot;pristine&quot; single cab split truck had gone nowhere.
&gt;Anyway, I wonder where I need to make the cut to make it a single cab. I
&gt;might take it a little back and make a double cab &quot;binz&quot; whatever that is. I
&gt;will need to cut some plywood just right to seal up the rear. Looks like
&gt;those upper windows might get in the way of the cutting. Any ideas about
&gt;what type of caulk to apply to the wood for a good seal?
