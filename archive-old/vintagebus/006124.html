Hi Russ
[not to sound like a smart mouth]
I have found that the show starts when you get there.....  that said.. I
frequently get there around 5 am or 6 am and the line has been waaaaaaay
down the street,,, the near by parking lot is full of  people wanting to
take their car inside.
So as soon as the sun is up,,, everyone is out talking ,swapping, looking at
the cars on the pavement,, as you see em driving!!!  hear em running!!
ya,!

My opinion ,, I find that the best.

The gates usually open at about  7.30  Rain or shine!   But NOT during a
HURRICANE !!!  Inside joke&gt;&gt;  last year a bunch of dumb a** Canadians [me
included] drove the 10 hrs to the show to Have Billy Cancel it cause of a
little Hurricane!  grrrr.
But there again,, we had a great time outside the show!  With all the others
who came!

Anyways ,,, Have fun!  I am sure you will,  I won't be able to make it this
time tho,,,
I just had MY fun at Auburn Hills VWoA  show..
more to come on that!
Later
