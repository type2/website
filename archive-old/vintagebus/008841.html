Hi y'all...

I've achieved much in the last week, and have updated my web pages to show
what I've done.  I'm now preparing for the final re-assembly, and as usual,
I'm finding that this process will take a much larger amount of time than
planned....maybe I shouldn't plan...that way, everything will roll along on
schedule.

www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Paint2.htm

Follow the link(s) at the bottom of the page.....

In the meantime, I find myself doing really important stuff, like cleaning
and polishing the spring metal engine hatch holder-upper, and the special
bolt which attaches it to the lid.  Have you noticed that that particular
bolt has the VW logo in relief on the head?  Well, to me, that means it
needs a polishing....

What should I use to keep the metal from oxidizing?  Should I coat it with
clear?  I plan to be shining up all the fasteners as I put them back on, and
replacing the more common ones with stainless.  Any comments?

Thanks,  Gene
