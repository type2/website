Subject: Re: [VB] pulley stuff w/ freeway flyer

&gt; I was doing a bit of math and it seems that running a power pully w/
&gt; the 356 gen pulley will result in about 2:1 ratio. That really seems
&gt; ideal, but has anyone run this combination?

one consideration
there can be a pretty wide variance in the ratio depending on where the
belt rides in the upper pulley.
