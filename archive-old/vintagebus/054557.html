Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ..speaking of Pucks

Mike &lt;turkisbus_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; asked:
Why is it that almost everyone who has a puck, seems
to tow it behind a camper of some sorts?? If your bus
is a camper, why do you need to pull one too?
-----------------------
Trust me, Get yourself a wife and a Westy even without children in the scene
you will soon be talked into getting a porta potty or endlessly needled about
it. 

Start with a ratty single cab, an agreeable girlfriend who is a &quot;sport&quot; a
make-shift blue tarp and PVC pipe tilt, grab the keys, one sleeping bag, a
bottle of tickle pink and some Iron City beer, and go camping. Cook over a fire
pit. Have lots of fun. Go camping all of the time. Have lots and lots of fun.
Write about all of the fun and send stories to OBR and Splitzine.

Have so much fun that you get married. Buy one more sleeping bag. Try to find
better job. Work more, worry more. Go camping less often. 

Attend a campout next to a Westy or (God forbid) a beautiful Dormobile...
Experience local microbrew beer and smooth collector wine from Dormie owners.
Meet more folks. Have some fun. Write about it on the the Lenti list.

Now you have to have a Westy. Next you will have to have a portapotti... Add
more comfortable and &quot;practical&quot; camping gear. Eventually the little two burner
LP stove on the ground or flip out table attached to the Westy's icebox isn't
good enough. The hanging little 1 liter LP can isn't good enough. Add one of
the big assed &quot;on the ground&quot; LP tanks and a long hose. Add a lantern tree. Now
you have a lantern tree, big tank, lpstove, portapotti, Westy and a wife. You
will soon &quot;need&quot; a collapsible camping table. Add a over sized hairy endlessly
shedding dog. Next you will have to have a tent and all of the poles. Now you
&quot;must&quot; have a roof rack. Eventually you collectively decide that stowing the
stuff in a trailer would be good. Finding a trailer in which you can sleep is
even better. Add a larger motor to haul the trailer, dog, wife and all of the
gear. Grab Fat Tire Amber Ale and a few bottles of the legendary Angelus 1989
(Stock# 058). Write about the adventures on the email lists. Meet even more
friends. Piss off the Californian VintageVW crowd by sweeping the awards. Get
published in the magazines. Answer questions via email and web sites.

More stress, more irritation. More over time to hang onto high pressure job.
See wife less often.  Go camping less often because it's such of a &quot;hassle&quot; to
prepare, clean and load all of the must have items. Go camping spend all
weekend setting up and tearing down all of the equipment and try to have fun.
Get insights from the cable channels.

Add a new baby. Add camp gear. Add baby gear (trust me). Disconnect cable TV.
Go camping less often. Sell spare buses. Enjoy hauling trailer while dog jumps,
baby cries, adults whine and stress. Pretend to have fun. Worry about layoffs.
Write short note to the email list before grabbing the red-eye to client
meetings. Call the wife when you can.

Have more kids, Buy more camp gear. Get laid off. Sell sacred parts stash.
Eventually nab job that keeps you home more often. Pay rent. Try to keep in
touch with your network of former clients and co workers. Go camping even less
often. Cover trailer and Westy with car covers. Read about campouts and car
shows on email. Sell TV at pawnshop.

Tell your new boss at the second job how you used to go camping. Sell remaining
camp gear at yard sale. Stay home and watch NASCAR. Drink beer. Wear
headphones. Disconnect web access to save money. Drink beer- what ever is on
sale- when you can escape to the market. Advertise Puck on VWPlanet. Dream
about owning a ratty single cab.
