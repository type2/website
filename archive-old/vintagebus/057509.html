Subject: RE: [VB] Not promoting a sale, just wondering...

Hello,

I bet I know what happened to this bus. I would be
willing to bet that this bus fell off the shop lift at
the place where it was being restored. At first I
thought that someone had rolled it but If it had been,
most of the windows would have been smashed and the
entire roof warped. I bet that this vehicle was
totaled by the insurance company and these guys bought
it from the scrap yard for a couple hundred bucks or
so. That is probably why they don't have a title. This
would explain such low miles as well. All this is just
speculation but it is my theory. Any way, have a great
day!

&gt; This is bad luck...looks like it used to be nice.
&gt; Check it out, anyone know who it belonged to, and
&gt; how
&gt; it happened, and where did the title go? item #
