&gt; First off, I need to get a gas tank with a sending unit for my 66 bus.  If I
&gt; get a baywindow tank, I'm going to have to modify the filler neck I've been
&gt; told.  Can I simply cut the next off of my old tank or on the bay window
&gt; tank and use a piece of rubber tubing (like on the bugs) to hold the filler
&gt; tubes together where they need to be?

Ok.  I can attest that a 69 tank fits near perfect with very little
trouble.

use the 69 tank, filler neck, hose between, clamps...also take those
straps that held it down with you.  and the sender.

also take the metal tube that connects to tthe top vent port.  disconnect
it where it goes into the filler neck compartment.  

filler neck unbolts, you'll see it.  take the gas cap too.  the
aftermarket caps suck major.  if its an old style cap, get it and put a
new gasket on it.

ok.

pull the 66 tank.  there is a trick to getting it out but i dont recall it
off thetop of my head. Dont try it with 8 gallons of gas and a crushed
tank....lots of fun, i tell ya...;)

So.

take the new tank and side it in there.  look at how it fits, etc.  see
how sort the straps are?  you need to lengthen them.    I used parts of
the other straps to do it.  sectioned ~2 inches onto the end of the old
straps (welding/brazing will work..i didnt have that option, so i screwed
it together, then ground the screw tips flush..)

take the neck, and look at how it fits.  close the door so you know how
much room you have.  It will .not. fit right up against the opening.  it
will sit a good bit more horizontal. look at the andle required, etc, and
see how the hose fits in with it all.  To attach the filler neck to the
bus i used bolts and nuts.  i used large fender washers at the bolt end
and squeezed it all together.  find/make a spacer for the lower bolt to
keep it from coming up as far.  once you get it all in, its kinda obvious
what it needs.;)


also, the vent tube.  attach as was attached before, then attach another
section of metal line to the end of it...i ran this line back into the
filler door area, with a loop-over at the end to keep water out...be sure
the end is higher then the filler.  secure as you see fit.

thats it.  I pulled the tanks from both buses, the engine from the 66,
installed the tank, and reinstalled the engine on a sunday afternoon,
taking my time.;)

grab the felt pads and glue them onto the tank, too, to keep the rattles
down...
