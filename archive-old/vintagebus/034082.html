Mag-fire is a Taiwan copy of the Compufire (made is U.S.A.) again this is a
product which I carry both brands. The importer of the Mag-Fire has told me
that they have been doing durability test on they're unit for 2 years, to
see how well they last. This is the same unit now being sold by EMPI and
most of the mag ads. I have recently installed one in one of my buses to
test, as i have a compufire in another of my buses,which hasn't presented
nay problems in approx. 6000 miles, I will keep the list and others informed
on this product.

ps. in my opinion it's a matter of dollars and cents! the Mag-Fire is almost
half as much as the Compu-Fire, it's your choice.

Hi, 
I just bought a breakerless points system called &quot;MagFire&quot;. The FLAPS was
out of Pertronix and since I was there anyway I bought it. Before I install
it I want some feedback if any is available. Has anyone had any experience
with this product?  If it has a bad reputation I will bring it back. 
Bob
