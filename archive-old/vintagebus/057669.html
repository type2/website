Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment

Costco has a great product called &quot;Oil Eater&quot; or &quot;Grease Eater&quot; don't remember which.  It a scrub brush, and some rubber gloves worked great for me.  Combine it with the hot water from the water heater, as Thom said, and be done in no time.

&gt; wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk out of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple green and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a little paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats left of the original paint.
