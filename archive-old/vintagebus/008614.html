Subject: Trailer hitch for the bus
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 2000 13:38:48 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

When I set about putting a trailer hitch on the 74 Super, I was stuck with a
hitch for an early bug.  This hitch was given to my by a guy who died from
cancer so I felt obligated to use it.  I used come C channel and fastened
the hitch on per Mr.VW's trick.  It works well.  2 bolts hold it to the
bumper and the other end fastens underneath the gizmo that goes between the
tranny horns.

About a month ago, an old guy by the name of Bob Sanders stopped by.  He's
an avid gun collector and an old VW lover from years past.  He gave me a 4
lug T3 rim and wheel and and hitch that he used to have mounted on the back
of his Squareback.

Last night after removing the bumper from the 67, I decided to size up the
hitch and it's about an inch or so too wide so I'm going to just put some
big old pipe on the metal pieces which will bend them into position.  The
hitch will fasten on via the bumper to frame bolts (I'll use an extra long
bolt) and then I can drill a hole or 2 in the bottom of the 67's bumper and
this will hold the hitch up.  I like this approach as once again, the frame
takes the pulling power and the bumper takes the tongue weight.  Sure it
won't be like a Westy hitch but at least I can make something work that I
got for free.  I won't even have to do any welding to make it work and I
like that.
