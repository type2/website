races  and having a place to get out of the wind. &lt;&lt;
Hi Clark,
She should come about shortly.  It is just so nice to go someplace for  the 
day and have the ability when you poop out to just be able to take a  nap, so 
the rest of the day you are not dragging.

&gt;&gt;I'm very interested in what you guys are doing for engines and  
transmissions.&lt;&lt;
We will Pmail you the modified tranny info we have.

&gt;&gt;  My bus did 65 to 70 the whole trip, but I've never  experienced being 
peened around by trucks passing me at 80.  I  don't know what I can do for 
stability, but I felt like I was on Mr. Toad's  Wild Ride much of the time.  Believe 
it or not, I got used to it and  learned to time the repelling and retraction 
that each truck brought with  it.  There is a lot of slop in the steering, so 
 I learned to start  all my steering before the crosswinds actually  
happened.  &lt;&lt;
That could be due to several factors.  FIRST buy a Bentley reprint of  the 
&quot;Workshop Manual Volkswagen Transporter&quot; for the 1963-67 bus.  Cost is  anywhere 
from about $70.00 to $100.00 depending on where you buy it.  Worth  every 
cent, it will save you so much time if you work on your own VW or even if  you 
have a shop do the work because you will have a much better idea if  they are 
trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  
  With the manual you should look into adjusting the steering  box.  Then 
check your tires to see if they are wieght rated for at  least 1525 Lbs., also 
going to KYB GR-2 shocks will help stiffen the suspension  and cut down on 
swaying and automatic instant lane changes.
  Also check out the type2_dot_com library and archives for a ton of info  there 
on subjects you have questions on, before posting the questions to the  list.  

&gt;&gt;This bus has an uncut dash, which was a nice surprise.   I want to find a 
period radio, so there will be no cutting I assure all of  you.&lt;&lt;
 
Sapphire radios were for the most part here in the USA the main radio  
installed at the VOA dearships and come in AM &amp; AM/FM flavors.   There were many, 
many other manufactures of radios of that era that fitted  VW and other Euro 
automobile manufactures dashes.  Blaupunkts are a  favorite of our's and came in 
in up to four bands (IE AM/FM/SW/LW or  some others like Marine), and most 
could have a push button under dash add  on for another band!

&gt;&gt;The mystery that remains for me is one related to my serial  number.  I 
looked through David Eccles book and found that all 1967s  started with 217.  
Mine starts with 237.  So I don't know what to  think.  The plate in the front 
matches the stamping by the engine, the M  plate is all there.... You guys 
probably know.&lt;&lt;
 
Chassi #s and part #s all have info deciferable only with  a secret decoder 
ring.  ;-)  The &quot;2&quot; means it is a type 2  (bus) model.  The &quot;3&quot; indicates it is 
a Kombi, not a deluxe, panel,  truck, etc....  The &quot;7&quot; means it is a 1967 
model built between AUG 66 and  AUG 67.  Check out Thom's Vintagebus_dot_com website, 
and enter your bus Mcode  plate in the registery there and you should get a 
much better idea about  your bus.
