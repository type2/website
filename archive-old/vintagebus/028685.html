Well, I'll let you all know my solution.
First off, I can't use the bay window heater boxes because they are beat to h_at_ll.  I had 2 beetle boxes in excellent shape, so I figured I would rig these to work.
I removed the lever arm and cut the short arm off with a dremel. I then made a small notch in the heater box under the pivot shaft, and drilled a small hole thru the lever and the pin. Now I'm going to spot weld the arm back on.  It's identical to the bay window box, and didn't require more than about 20 minutes to do.
So now I have two good heater boxes, i'm considering doing the other box with an arm on both sides, sort of a universal heater box. 
Why don't they make them that way in the first place?

&lt;&lt; Hey list,
 
 I am attempting to use early heater boxes with the long lever on a later, 
(71) van.  It appears to me that the short lever is just on the opposite side 
of the control box.  How do I get the box apart to flip the lever over?
 Thanks

I dont know if it works that way

either find some bay window heater boxes, or used bug/splitty ones and tye 
the heat on

did you all know the diff between split annd bug heater boxes is the down 
facing lever has two holes an dthe the slightly upper hole is where you 
attach the clip for the bolt for the splitty heat cables.  Using the other 
place wont give you the ability to turn the heat on or off all the way.
