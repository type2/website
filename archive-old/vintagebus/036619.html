OK. Maybe only one. I started tearing it apart tonight. Got it up on 
jackstands, all wheels removed. Then realized I should've broken the rear 
drums loose first! Oh, well, I'll get to them later. Worked on teh front. Got 
it tore down to the bare spindles(which wasn't too difficult being as 
everything except teh drum was gone!). Then I began chiseling away 33 years 
of crud. My question stems there. What kind of front end is this and what is 
the usual resto process for this? I have done nothing but type 1's and 
hummers the last 4 years, and this looks like a combination of ball joint, 
link pin, and jeep front end. What exactly am I looking at under there under 
all that dirt grime etc...I want to do this right, but I'm not rich either. 
If I can fix/rebuild it, that is what i will do. I don't want to replace 
everything with new  parts! TIA!
