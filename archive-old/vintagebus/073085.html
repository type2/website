Subject: Tail Light housing needed (1961)

Does anyone have a single tail light housing they
would like to sell for a 1961 bus?  Don't need the
bezel or glass, just the housing.  Mine has the wire
terminal missing on one side and very poor continuity
on the opposite side.  

I would even consider one that is broken but has the
electrical terminals in tact to try and repair mine.

Thanks

Matthew
