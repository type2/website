Eric,

Actually, you could quantify the colored water in a tube pressure 
measurement by first taping the tube to, say the b pillar.  make a mark with 
a sharpie where the water is with the engine off, then make another mark for 
the water level when haulin' down the freeway.  Subtract the two distances, 
then convert: 1 inch of h20 = 0.249 kPa.

Mike A.

&gt;This can be checked by us 'non-college' folk as well.
&gt;
&gt;Run some small clear tubing (fish store would be ideal), and run the hose
&gt;from the driver seat, back to the engine bay. Put the end of the hose in a
&gt;jar filled with colored water and haul ass down the freeway. The more the
&gt;water sucks up the clear tube, the more vacuum there is. (the smaller the
&gt;tube the better). Bad part is, this gives no 'numbers' to reference for
&gt;other people. We can just say &quot;it pulled up this high on the hose&quot;. Not 
&gt;very
&gt;scientific, BUT, it could tell you if any mods you made reduced engine bay
&gt;vacuum or not, and by how much.
