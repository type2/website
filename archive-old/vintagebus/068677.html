Hi Ray,
The problem apparently is that the stock 34 PICT-3 DP carb and upper section 
of the intake manifold both have larger diameter venturi and tubing.  This 
actually slows the flow going through the carb and lessens the carb ability 
at sensing the flow of the air and its reactions are not as accurate.  This 
is why all DP engines really came into thier own with FI which was able to 
meter the air flow much better and supply fuel much better increasing HP, 
torque and even MPG.
  To make carbs accurate and versatile as near as possible to FI, one would 
have to invent a carb and possibly intake manifold that could change internal 
diameter throughout the entire length in response to RPM and internal vaccum 
changes.  That way at lower RPMs the flow would be kept up and the vaccum in 
the venturi high enough for the carb to meter it properly.  Then in much 
higher RPMs open the diameter up for more volume of flow and keeping the 
vaccum in the manifold not too high and restrictive for the much higher RPM 
HP increase.
  For short and/or not so steep hills having the higher HP probably will do, 
but on steeper and/or longer hills torque is what will crank you up there.  
Take a look at the graph in the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual, section M-30, 
page 5 for a very interesting example of when RPM wise HP and torque peak and 
how seperate in the RPMS they are.  Now if only we could find simular graphs 
for SP and DP 1600 engines....
