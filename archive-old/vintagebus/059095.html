Subject: Re: [VB] My trip to Time-Fastener

EZ-Lok company makes an insert 5/8&quot;-18 on the outside, M12x? on the inside.
Their online catalogue only lists 1/2&quot; and 3/4&quot; depths, I'll call them and see
if they have anything deeper hidden away. They also list VW case-savers among
their products, and have a photo of a bug on their website (don't tell VW).
Anyone familiar with their inserts?

&gt; Darned, we we afraid that might be the case!  If the oversized holes in your
&gt; RGBs have threads you can have a machine shop drill and tap a set of 5/8&quot;
&gt; bolts with 12x1.5 tapped holes through them.  Wrench these bolts into place
&gt; and mark for cutting to be slightly below the surface of the RGBs.  Back out
&gt; the bolts and hacksaw each about 2/3 of the thickness of the bolts thickness.
&gt;  Wrench the bolts back down and bend off the heads.  File/Dremil any high
&gt; points and make sure to drill and pin the 5/8&quot; threads to prevent these solid
&gt; inserts from backing out.
