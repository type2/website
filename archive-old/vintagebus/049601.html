Subject: Re: [VB] type3 cooler

&gt;It's interesting to compare the VW cooling concept (and listen to the relative
&gt;arguments) and then compare them to the equivalent Porsche ideas.  The major
&gt;break in the two was at the 911, of course.  For instance, VW people argue
&gt;incessantly about cooling flaps, and how you doom your engine to a certain
&gt;death without them.  The 911 engine doesn't use them, and people get upwards
&gt;of 300k on those engines.  Or the talk about cylinder fin attributes - the
&gt;larger 911 engines don't have fins on top of the cylinders - they're smooth.
&gt;The cylinders on my 2.7 have merely a token of finnage
&gt;Thom

yes, but... the porsche is built to MUCH higher/tighter tolerances. i
wonder if the differences could be related to that, ie, for the $$$ vw was
willing to sink into each motor, certain items were compromises that
porsche didn't take; maybe thermo flaps help a CHEAP vw motor warm/cool
properly, and the expensive porsche motor has engineered them out?

i'd still love to see some hard #s on what oil cooler and tin mods REALLY
work - i'd be out in the yard with tin snips in a second!
