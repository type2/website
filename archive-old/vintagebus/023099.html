Do you have gas?  Did you try taking the gas cap off see if the tank burps?
 Didja check the fuel filter?  How about emptying the bowl on the carb and
seeing what comes out?

&gt;Tried to take my Kombi for a drive down the street, and it died on me. I

&gt;and see if I can get it running again enough to drive it back home.
&gt;So....if it wasn't doing it before, and it's doing it now, do you think
&gt;I've got junk in the line, filter, or carb? Or does this sound like
&gt;something else. It didn't do it until the engine was warmed up, and even
&gt;then it had been running for a little bit. It seems to have enough fuel as
&gt;well. Any ideas would be appreciated before I get into it.
