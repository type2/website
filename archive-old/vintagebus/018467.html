Subject: Re: [VB] Recovering Front Seats-Doesn't Look Easy

this may be a chickensh*t answer.  i reupholstered the seats in my '67 beetle.  i got burlap sacking stuff, wolfsburg west horsehair pads and tmi seat covers.  i took the seats down to their components - back separated from seat.  i spent a weekend on the project - prolly 10 to 15 hours.  it was a pain in the ass.  my hands were sore and raw from about a week afterward.  having a day job as a librarian does not lend itself to work of this nature.

two weeks ago i took the seat from my single cab to a local upholstery shop.  for $180 i received a reupholstered seat that is, in my opinion, a work of art.  the professional used the original as a pattern and material that very closely approximates what had been on the seat.  for the older vehicles, he seems to take a &quot;restoration&quot; approach.

i get a lot more pleasure out of sitting in my truck than i do sitting in my beetle.  duh, it's a type2 you might be thinking and perhaps that is why.  it's also that when i look at or sit in the '67's seats and remember the weekend spent reupholstering them, my hands twinge with remembered pain and i frown with remembered frustration.  the truck doesn't have any of those negatives associated... except in writing the check but for me vw related money spent takes precedence even over food.
