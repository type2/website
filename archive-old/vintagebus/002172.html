&gt;  I couldn't agree more! Dove Blue was never in question, just whether or
&gt;not I should go for total authenticity and just primer the cargo area, even
&gt;though it's covered by wood.


Okay...now you've managed to get me thoroughly confused....not hard to
do....so your cargo area isn't primered under the wood?  Did someone go in
and paint it?  'Cause stock the campers came as Kombi's (cab painted, but
primered and bare in the cargo area) and then the wood panelling and camper
stuff went in.......right?  So what's up with your camper?  Please clarify
for me...unless you thik I'm too far lost!  *8-)
