&gt; When I bought my 1967 Kombi it was already lowered. I am not sure if I
&gt; like it or not. I seems like a bumpy, uncompherable ride. But then on
&gt; the other side, it won't roll as easy.
&gt; Should I keep it? What should I do?

How about finding someone who wants to lower the bus they have and either
swap buses or parts?
