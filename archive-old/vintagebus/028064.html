Subject: Re: [VB] Do side scoops work????

Didn't Hoover or somebody do tests last year about wether or not those things
helped.  Whomever it was found that at low speeds the bus wasn't causing
enough turbulence that more air was actually getting in, but at higher speeds
there was a turbulence that forced the air in better straight into the vent
and the scoops actually inhibited air flow at high speed.  There was
something about a 4&quot;, 6&quot;, or 8&quot; ???? turbulent zone down the sides coming off
the front of the bus cutting ever so fluently through the air, that inhibited
the scoops from being effective for getting air into the engine compartment.
Don't quote me on any of this, but it made sense at the time.  Somebody must
have the archives from back then.

Later,
Aaron

&gt; Someone should test the engine compartment air pressure with/without

&gt; almost junk that scoops help a lot.  That has been my experience.  When
&gt; the engine is running the way it should the scoops only help direct dirt
&gt; and crud into the engine compartment.
