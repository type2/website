I am not sure who made the seals I got for my bus...I got them from Bus Depot,
it doesn't say WW anywhere on the bag they came in. They are basically a
square profile, black, and not solid all the way through(hollow center).

Anyway, when installed my doors do not shut all the way. They seem to be
latching appropriately, but when you look at the door from the outside they
are not flush with the outside of the body. hope that gives you some info
about them...I am going to try to salvage my old seals.
