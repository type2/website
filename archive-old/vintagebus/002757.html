 1- The 58 Binz was primer inside the engine area, just like under the
ashtray and radio plate.
 2- Can't make it to Mark's wild July 4th weekend this year, sorry Mark,
hope you miss us, be there next year!
 3- The local sheriff just closed down the SAND BAR for July 4th weekend.
Where will all the 1500 boats and their drunkin drivers and passengers go
this year? Thats why We can't make Marks 4th this year, they put all of us
on standby callout for the weekend.
Plus going to see the daughter and son-in-law in Baltimore 1st week of Aug.
so saving time and $$. Anyone from SoCal knows what the sand bar is. Crazy
place on big weekends. Free sex, pornos being filmed, Jeremy somebody was
there last holiday, stabings, all kinds of crap going on. The chamber of
commerence loves it. We locals stand back and watch.
 4- Loaded up and going to the anything with a motor show Sat morning at the
Avi casino in Laughlin. Think I will be the only VW bus there, should be
fun. Hoping some old dude comes up and says &quot; Hey I got one of those in the
barn, but it has a bunch of windows and a hole in the roof and I want it
towed out and you can have it for free&quot;. Will be cooking breakfast and
chicken sturfry for lunch. Gota beat Ronnie out of some of these local
buses.
 5- Bye


 John ( on the show circut ) Howard
