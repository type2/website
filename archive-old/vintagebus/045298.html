   Since my registration, tire guage, and other junk that 
 accumulates on the tray under my dash seems to roll 
 around and collect behind the pod where I can't reach 
 it, and goes swimming when it rains,
====
get some new window seals -clean up the rust, reseal with roofing tar!  
.........
 I'm considering 
 making a vacuum formed, ABS organizer tray that fits 
 there, keeping stuff tidy and dry (I'm the Operations 
 Manager for a plastics company). 
  Another idea of mine are caps that fit snugly over the 
 fresh air vents to seal out drafts and water. 
============
either duct tape over the intake grill or take the fresh air vent aparts and 
install new seals.
....................
  If your interested in either, or have any other ideas 
 for formed, fabricated or machined plastic parts let me 
 know. I am going to try to get started on drawings and 
 molds in my spare time this weekend.

hm- I can't think of anything right now.  knobs?   Someone was making plastic 
air deflectors you attach either side of the fresh air vent- to direct the 
air in a more cooling fashion, are those still made?
