Thanks all for all the help so far.
Wish list is a little smaller now.
Still a few questions.

Are all five headliner bows the same length?  I have four, three are the same
one is a little shorter.  Where do I get the missing one?  I have
both cab shorties.

When installing Euro taillights where do you run the extra wire for
turn signals?  I am going to cheat off the front ones.  I need to run
two wires to rear.

If some kind soul could do this for me I will send you 20 bucks.
I need a pattern for all interior panels.  Right now I need the two
pieces above windshields behind sunvisors.  Then I can at least put
in the headliner.
I don't want to try to make the around headlight bucket kick panels
without a pattern.  The rest I could figure out, but I have nothing
to start from.
Where do the chrome strips go?  How wide is the ivory insert on the panels?
How much Grey above and below?  I need help with the panels.
Trace them on some butcher paper and send them to me.

How do you get the grab handles off of the middle seat?  I figured
out the two screws in the middle.  How are they held into the seat
tubes?

Wish list:

two thumb nuts for fuel guage.
Rear seat back with bar.
Middle and rear Seat hold down thingys.  Bolts and wing nuts would be nice too.
Cargo door stop straps with hardware.
I need four pop-out window hinges.  (Mounted on body.) I have latches.
Wiper everything.  I have motor and all inside parts. Two shafts
poking through front now with out anything but zip ties keeping them
&gt;from falling inside.
I have no arms blades nuts rubbers etc...
Front chrome &quot;VW&quot; clips.  Keeps falling off...
Front and cargo rubber mats.
Door handles.
Key thing for gas flap and engine lid.
Ideas on best place to get all door rubbers and slider felts, etc...

Thanx so much for all the help so far!
