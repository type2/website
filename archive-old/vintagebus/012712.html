&gt; This week, a number of teachers including myself got
&gt; together to do an
&gt; inter disciplinary unit for earth day that would
&gt; last all week.  We
&gt; scheduled the kids so that we would have all 600 in
&gt; rotations.  We did the
&gt; same 2 hour presentation 10 times this week!

If we had more instructors like you, Id bet we would
have much better schools producing a much higher
educated student. Its a shame some of the students
loose interest in a subject because of it being
boring, but a good teacher with a head on there
shoulder could make a pile of cow sh*t interesting:)
How do I know your asking yourself.... At our high
school we had a math instructor, Mr Zapata, man he was
cool!!! Would talk to ya like a human, was concerned
if ya had a problem, be it at school, home, whatever.
Nearly everyone made it out of there with a good
grade, not because he gave em to us, but because we
earned it:) Its not that math is boring, just not
interesting to some folks, but he could make ya like
it without you knowing what hes up to:)
 When Rick &amp; I got into our carb rebuilding
discussion, you could tell by the tone of his voice he
was sincere in what he was saying. He &quot;made&quot; me want
to go to the house &amp; pull every plug out of my carb to
vat it the right way:) Most people would either 1. try
to blow ya off, or 2. try to blow smoke up your a**. I
have a good feeling that he would show the same zeal &amp;
enthusiasm with his students weather it be working on
a VW, or building there first tool box:)
 Sorry about the bandwith, Im just a firm beliver in a
good teacher:) Mabey next time Im &quot;smack dab in the
middle of the USA&quot; i could set in on a class or two:)
I can always stand to learn something new:)
 Oh, bus content... Rick, when are we gonna get a
formal invite for &quot;Buses By the Barn&quot;.....:)

Later,
David Pierce KD5FVM
Ft Worth, TX         wishing my spelling teacher was
                     as good as my math teacher:)
