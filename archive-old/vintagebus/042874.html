Sounds to me that the bus you're talking about could be a Sundial Camper
conversion.  If the windows crank out like awnings, then it's probably a
Sundial or EZ Camper.  It seems even more likely to be a camper because it
comes with a back seat you said.  I don't think any panel ever came with
any back seats unless it was a conversion.  And I agree with Thom, if it's
missing just the taillights and headlights, count on it missing more.  I
should know, I have been screwed on more than one occasion.  Good luck!

&gt; seat for it. That is the good part. The bad is that the PO cut 3 westy style 
&gt; windows on each side, with one on both doors. It has all the glass for these, 
&gt; but I would probably have these fixed. Does anybody know how difficult or it
