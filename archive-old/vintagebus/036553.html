   Good post Fred, even if some of our brethen are calling it a 
  story you told your wife . . :-)
  
   A nylon stocking obviously can be stretched or not for a different
  degree of air flow . . oiled , it would stop even more . .
  
   Can be used as a temp fan belt . . a temp cover for a bad CV Boot.
  
   In our recent Gulf War, wives were being asked to send pantyhose
  to our troopies in the Dirt . . . they make an excellent &quot;gun sock&quot;
   . . you can even shoot thru them . . keeps the grit out of the
  action . . for all I know they were using them on their vehicles too.
  
   It wouldn't hurt to have a pair in the emergency kit . .

Mike (and the Mailing List),

Don't overlook the obvious -- you can wear the things too.  

Panty-hose are standard items in most pilot's survival kit.

(At Inuvik, while working on a fellow's front wheel bearings, I had my kit
sorta strewn around.  Several people noticed the packages of  Queen-sized
(tall) panty-hose... but nobody said nothing :-)

-Bob Hoover

PS -- One chore panti-hose aren't up to is replacing the traditional sock &amp;
rope 'sling-refrigerator'.  (ie, insert can, tie sock to rope, soak with
gasoline &amp; swing around your head...  If nothing catches fire, the contents of
the can will become cooler)

Reason it don't work:  This new gasoline dissolves panti hose.  (Baja now gets
it's gas from the refinery in Long Beach, California.  [Usta come over on the
ferry.])
