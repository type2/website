Hans I remeber you are of Canadian desent right?

But &quot;Hans&quot; is that Canadian or US 2 cents??....If Canadian it is not
worth as much in the US..methinks about only  .08 of a cent?? 

To Jeff--

BUS CONTENET...I have a very clean and working speedo correct for a `67 
$20 shipped in the US if you need it...it reads 69,000 miles and is
correct original miles....so you could actually lose a bit of mileage in
your bus..
