 Hi steve, I have a '65 Crew Cab as well!  When I bought mine it came with a bed full of parts, including 2 aprons.  One is a push button one (anyone need one? its red) and the other I don't know what it's home was, but it won't fit either.  I don't remember if it is b/c I have a be*tle engine in there or what.  So, I guess all I can really contribute is that, I'm in the same boat.  

Benj.

&gt;I have a 65 Crew Cab. The apron on it looks funky. Is the apron on the 65 Crew different from the 65 Transporter?
