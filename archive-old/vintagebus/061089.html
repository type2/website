&gt;    My wife has wanted a new car for a long time now. It's to hot for her to
&gt; drive her rag top beetle, she won't drive any of my buses, so I went out and
&gt; bought her a NEW car. I really would of liked to get her a VW product, but
&gt; with all the BS that VW is doing I followed suit and bought her a PT Cruiser
&gt; (at least it looks retro) instead of a VW product (I really wanted a
&gt; Eurovan).. I am going to take a pic of it in front of my 6 buses and her bug
&gt; at my house and send it to VWoA customer relations with a note saying &quot; I
&gt; would have bought one of your products, but with no support of VWoA in the
&gt; vintage community I refuse to help support you (VWoA)
