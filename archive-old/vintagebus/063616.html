&gt; Brakes are not trivial. Yours are unknown. I haven't looked at them, and you

Hi Tom,
We agree with Dave!  If it does not stop, steer, or wheels roll properly it 
is an accident waiting to happen.  We have seen steering tie rods worn so 
badly they were ready to pop apart.  Front wheel bearings so badly damaged 
due to lack of lubrication from ancient gunked up grease that even one of the 
inner bearings was mostly dust.  So, drain and refill your tranny and RGBs.  
Grease the front wheel bearings and pump the zerk fittings full of grease.  
Replace all flex brake lines and change brake fluid completely.  Write all 
these repairs and maintance in a log book for the bus, and of course most of 
all inspect everything, with the help of the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual!
