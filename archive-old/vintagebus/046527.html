&gt; &lt;&lt;p.s. The reason why I'm asking is that bugs are 
&gt;EVERYWHERE around here.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thats why probably over 2/3rds of the early Type 2 redux
&gt;transaxles that I do are actually converted Beetle boxes.
&gt;For the most part they are identical but do have a different
&gt;3rd and 4th gear ratio.  You want the Type 2's ratios as
&gt;with a late Bug 3.875 ring and pinion (vs. the 4.375 or 4.125 
&gt;that your Split has) and the post-'64 redux box ratios you
&gt;can cruise down the highway at 3200 +/- rpm at 65mph
&gt;all day long.  Once you've been in one of those converted
&gt;Type 2s you'll never want to got back to the old 'stock'
&gt;ratio'd gearboxes- its as different as night and day.  Have
&gt;you been in an Split-window and actually passed someone
&gt;on the highway without worrying about punching a rod 
&gt;through the case??  You can with these gearboxes.

DITTO... Yeah, what he said... Uh Huh!!... Agreed... Two thumbs way
up... Believe it dude...  Nuthin' better that actually being able to
pass someone IF you want to or hold a civil conversation since you can
hear your what your companion is saying without yelling!!  And think of
it this way; since you have lowered the hwy RPMs, you'll have a whole
stable full of extra ponies in reserve to blow by the other
under-powered cars on the road...  O.K., maybe that's pushing the
reality envelope a bit but you get the idea.  Good luck with the bus!!
