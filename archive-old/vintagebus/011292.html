Subject: Need help - Chassis # vs. Body #
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Trying to do some production dating.  VW's &quot;Progressive refinements...&quot;  1964 
edition lists both chassis and body numbers for a given production month.  
Which is the one behind the passenger side of the front seat on a single cab? 
 Where is the other one?

Thanks,
Dan
