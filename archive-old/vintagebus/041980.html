&gt; &gt;Even Ace has &quot;sold out&quot; and is becoming more &quot;home depot-esque&quot; - all of
&gt; &gt;their tools are now the cheepie taiwanese crap, and more and more of their
&gt; &gt;fasteners are baggie-ware.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this is a regional thing.  Here in Oklahoma I haven't found this
&gt; as much.  Also, I think Ace has at least two kinds of stores - the
&gt; big Home Depot-type &quot;Ace&quot; ones which I think are &quot;company owned&quot; and the
&gt; smaller ones like &quot;Bob's Ace Hardware&quot; which I think are some kind
&gt; of &quot;franchise&quot; or &quot;associate&quot; deal.  The latter are the ones I'm
&gt; talking about. 

The proliferation of big box home centers has really put a dent in local
hardware stores, but it seems that there is always one or two survivors in
a given area where you go when you need to find that really odd fastener
and you really don't care what it costs.  In my neck of the woods the
place is called &quot;Newhall Hardware&quot; and has been in business for 50+ years
without affiliation to any chain at all.  I have to turn sideways to
walk down the aisles, but they will likely have what I need.
