Subject: FINALLY: 55-58 Deluxe door panels in stock
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

That's right you heard it here first 55-58 Deluxe door panels (with the heat 
seams) and seat material are now in stock. Correct color and texture 
material. However, there are only 9 sets. So, if your doing a 55-58, now is 
the time to buy, we will not be producing more. Email for details.
