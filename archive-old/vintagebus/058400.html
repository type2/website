Subject: RE: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

Flaps without a thermostat is just louvered holes. Good luck to your
longevity.

I know conventional wisdom these days is to run both
thermostat and flaps, but I have had good luck running
only flaps, no thermostat (even in North Country
temperatures decades below zeros).  That is,
everything in its place except the bellows.  You might
have to let her warm up a bit, but one of the selling
points of an air cooled engine is how fast it warms
up.

&gt; Thermostat and flaps, don't leave home without them.
&gt; I always search the
&gt; wrecking yards and various places for brackets,
&gt; flaps, push bars, and
&gt; attachment hardware. I get a lot of engines with all
&gt; of this removed and if
&gt; it's going back in stock, I always insist on
&gt; replacing everything for the
&gt; cooling that was missing. The thermostats are only
&gt; $4 mail order, cheap for
&gt; the life you add to your motor.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Dan,
&gt; Install a thermostat if carburetored.  If you have
&gt; the complete engine with 
&gt; Mexi FI which helps control oil temp via leaning out
&gt; the fuel mixture and 
&gt; sensing this with temp sensors.  Plus as you say
&gt; much of Mexico does not get
&gt; 
&gt; as cold as the USA does.  Also the flaps help to aim
&gt; cooling air to the 
&gt; proper places and if you ever leave you state and
&gt; end up in weather lower 
&gt; than 70F the thermostat will help keep your engine
&gt; happy and keep you warmer
&gt; 
&gt; with more heat exchanger output.  Especially since
&gt; you Floridians tend to 
&gt; freeze once the outside temps drop below 70F!  ;-)
