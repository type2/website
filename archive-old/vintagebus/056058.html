Subject: Re: [VB] somebody stop me

I know, I've looked around and in some places (like SoCal) you can buy new
cheaper than used. I was used to paying like 50$ bucks for a dolly but last
time in Cali they nailed me for 350$ for a one way, seems everyone is
leaving SoCal so they raise the rate. In this case the guy just wants to get
rid of it so its cheaper to buy it than a trailer. This way I can haul one
or more.

&gt; &gt;You know your buying too many buses when you start adding up how many
times
&gt; &gt;you've rented a tow dolly.
&gt;
&gt; That's exactly why I just put up the cash for a trailer. I got a NEW
&gt; 16 ft. double axle trailer with ramps for around $850.00. Funny thing
&gt; is used ones don't sell for much cheaper than that around here. Made
&gt; sense for me and much safer. I've gotten way more than my money back
&gt; on it. I use it all the time for stuff other than hauling VW's. I
&gt; help friends retrieve VW's as well. Even towed my brothers '55 Ch*vy
&gt; 2-door home on it. Money well spent.
