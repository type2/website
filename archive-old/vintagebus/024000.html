    My 1966 bus was recently converted to 6 volts and everything runs
smooth except the emegency flashers and the fuel guage.  I think that I
have the emergency flasher problem licked thanks to Wolfsburg West
(great bunch of people).  I have attempted to find the problem with the
fuel guage but to no avail.  I have 12 volts coming to the guage and
proper grounding but she no work.  I have tried another 6 volt guage but
it did not work.  Can you use a 6 volt guage in a 12 volt system?
