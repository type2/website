&lt;&lt; Hey there guys and gals..
 While the motor is out of the 62...I thought I'd take the opportunity to
 clean all of the crud out of the engine compartment.  The gas tank is
 turquoise, and the rest is black.  Is this the common color
 configuration?  What determined what color the gas tank was painted?
 Are all engine bays painted black?  I borrowed a pressure washer and
 some environmentally friendly degreaser.  Can I spray out the engine
 compartment with this?  I don't want to have the degreaser wreck any of
 the paint...and I will read all of the applications for use before
 hand....  Has anyone else done this before?  How does it turn out?  I'll
 tape off the voltage regulator to keep it dry...
 
 Another license plate possibility which I am really liking... (just
 thought of it) is DRIVEIT ....yeahhhhh... :)

I always though the gas tanks were grey and the engine compartment the same 
color as the bottom half as the bus.  

only vw paint that seemed to wear off for me was in the engine compartmnet of 
my 53.  but I really think they changed paint since then, or maybe those 
colours are bad (the chocolate and vanilla combo) or maybe the acid rain 
damaged them, but every other VW paint has seemed robust and sturdy.
