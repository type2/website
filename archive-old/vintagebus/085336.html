Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] RGB's

&gt; Buy the one gallon gear oil bottle with the accessory hand pump from
&gt; Sta-Lube and make sure it is GL-4 not GL-5 rated.  &gt; : 5/9/2006

Thx all, in spite of probably a dozen buses, this is my first split so first
time serviceing rgb's
and the manual threw me calling for .5pints plus a discussion on samba about
not wanting too much oil in the rgb's. I waaay prefer the lists, too bad
v-list has been so quiet.

I did know enough to make sure the fills would open before I drained it ; 0
The one thing that drives me nuts liveing in the GWN as opposed to living in
SoCal, is the stupid little things we dont get. Luckily when I went over to
Port Angeles I pu'd a bottle pump to replace the one that was lost in
moveing, but a non GL-5 oil is not to be found from any vendor, even after
letting them know that the crc products they carried also made sta-lube,
they were told its not made anymore! I think I'll have to make due with
whats available and grab some straight 90wt next time I'm in Port Angeles.
