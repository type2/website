Subject: friday Q

Okay, since it's friday:

If you would have ordered a panel from the factory with the sliding door 
option, would it be a sliding door with no windows?  Did VW make such a 
door?

If they didn't, hopefully this post will not spawn a super-kewl 
never-been-done-before-custom job. ;-)

Just wondering...
