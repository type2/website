&gt;&gt;Gentlepersons-
                      Not to be too negative. but I strongly suspect that VW
is only inter-
ested in selling new VW's. Proof positive; quick poll, how many aircooled
owners have
had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with service/parts?



I have two water cooled VWs currently on the road; a 98 NB that gets
serviced at the dealer and a 93 EV that has only been to the dealer once in
over 100k miles.  I'd rate the service at the shop near me as slightly above
average.  My drivers side power window (I hate power windows BTW) in the NB
has broken in the down position twice and the switch inside has also broken
twice.  The first time they fixed the window, they forgot to hook up the
speaker.  The EV has the typical voltage regulator problem in the dash that
controls the gas gauge.  This was replaced about 3 months ago but didn't fix
the problem 100%... problems yes but the people at the dealership seem ok.
I have friends with D*dge and F*rd mini vans that seem to have way more
problems than me...  With all the crap in the new vehicles, what can you
expect.  That's why I like the early ACVWs and my 75 scirocco (the scirocco
is not on the road right now :-(  ).  They're simple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But, on long trips I'd always choose the newer cars for the comfort, speed,
reliability, and mileage.
