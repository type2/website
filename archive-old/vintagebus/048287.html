I think I need the crankshaft oil seal changing as 
there's a bit of a persistent drip at idle. However, I 
know this can be a symptom of much worse in terms of 
crank bearings.....what kind of play should I have on 
the crank? I can shift it about 2mm at the moment.

actually the main seal leaking is a sign of.....a bad main seal.   It doesn't
neccesarily mean anything else.  However, the end play is a bad sign.   the
play should be .4 to .6 off the top of my head- think that's inches- like for
setting the valves.   Just a hair of movement.  Is that 2mm just the crank or
also flexing the pulley?  If you hear a thunk the main bearings are worn badly
and you should seriously consider a rebuild.   Depending on your time and
money available you can just pull the motor and change the seal and re shim
the crank to reduce play- reduce further wear.   Change the oil cooler seals
while the motor is out.    But with that much play- how worn is the rest of
the motor?   Something to think about.  Baby that bus and you will get more
life out of the motor,  but set up that rebuild fund right away.
