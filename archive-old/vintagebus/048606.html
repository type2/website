Subject: Fastest Growing Bus Club?

Fastest Growing Bus Club?

I've got to tell you about a new bus club that got it's start less than a
year ago at Busses No Where Near the Arch (thanks Bill Bowman for a
wonderful campout).

This small group of 3 rag tag corn feed Nebraska boys (the N on the
football helmets stands for knowledge) got together and decided they needed
a club of their own.  And since there were just 3 of them, they decided to
call themselves the Buskatiers!

They had the idea, but needed something to get them jump started, they just
couldn't decide when and where, so another old bus person and myself from
the KC Kombies decided we would get the ball rolling and scouted out a
place for their inaugural event which was to be a campout.  We scouted the
campground, decided on a date and told them we would be there camping if
they wanted to join us.  That was all it took and they were off and
running!!  In no time they had planned the event, drew up a logo for their
new club, made up some great event signs, created some nice iron on tee
shirt logos and even had the neatest magnetic stickers made up to give away
at the campout!  Did I say these guys have some energy!!  The campout was a
great success and loads of fun.

Since that first campout, this group has drawn together some wonderful
people.  At first they were sending messages around by email and listing
everyone's address.  Then just a couple months ago, I introduced a person
to the group who works with computers and servers from his house.  He has
been able to set up a dedicated server for their own list serve!!  Still
another talented person has recently come on board to create a web page
that rivals some of the best and is constantly being updated it with trip
reports and pictures.

In just 8 months this group has grown from 3 to over 30 people from all
over the US, added their own list serve and created their own web page
along with doing some really fun activities!!  This is a good bunch of bus
people and a lot of fun to be with.

This is a really nice bunch of men and women.  Check out their (I guess I
should say our, as I am proud to me counted as one of them) web page at:
