Subject: RE:  shipping two pallets of VW interior parts

&gt;What's the most cost-efficient way to accomplish this? One 
&gt;shipper wants $1,000 (for $400 of parts!?) to move two pallets 
&gt;from Ohio to San Diego... Toldeo, even, which is a hub city. 

Could the parts be re-packaged into more managable size containers?
Possibly part of your cost is due to the necessity of having a fork-lift
there to load the things onto a truck.

A few years ago I had a complete (large) bedroom suite shipped from
Amarillo, TX to San Antonio.  I called a few shipping companies and had
quotes like $500, $700, etc.  One moving company suggested that if time
was not of the essence that they could schedule them to be on the next
truck coming my way for only $125 (I think they called it
'drop-shipping'??).  That included house-to-house delivery!  A few weeks
later they called and asked if they could send the truck by a few days
later - no problem.

Just a few thoughts...
