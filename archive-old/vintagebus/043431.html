Hey all!

A friend of mine always gets his oil changed (in his non-VW) at the 
local &quot;Qwiki-Loob&quot; place.  On one hand I don't understand why anybody
would do that as opposed to changing their own oil, but on the other
hand, at least it gets changed this way.  I was looking at the receipt
from a recent change and noticed a few interesting items...

 1. Chassis Lube... SEALED
 3. Oil Filter..... COMPLETE
11. BatteryWater... MainFree

Not too unusual for a late-model, FWD car.  This got me to thinking,
I wonder what kind of meltdown they'd go into if you took a Bus in
there?  Nine zerks (to be greased with the wheels off the ground), 
three gear oil places, battery, no oil filter...Make 'em *earn*
their $19.95!  :)  Bonus points if it takes them more than five
minutes to figure out how to open the church-key engine lid...

Note that I am *not* suggesting that anyone actually subject their
primo barndoor or Westy to the local Qwiki-Loob!  Just sitting here
on Friday wondering about such things.
