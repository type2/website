Subject: RE: [VB] 2 buses parting out 1967s- NOT MINE

DOH! Number is 610-965-8989(VWVW)

Al, What is the complete phone #? Thanks...

Marc L.

 Found two buses, a camper and dlx, both 67s being parted. Call
610-965-8989, and ask for bill or tim. Located in eastern pa. Now you
 know what I do. I saw them, some good metal, some glass, dlx trim,
 chrome, westy pop top, westy rear seat, headlights. No guages or dlx
 interior panels. Al
