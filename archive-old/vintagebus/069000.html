Subject: 36 and 40 hp crud for sale

its a long shot... but i have to lighten my stash for my upcoming 
move, and i am NOT likely to build a 36 or 40 hp engine before 
june... shoot, i'm still trying to get the 1679 together!!

so i took all i had, laid it out, and snapped some photos. what i 
would LIKE to do is get someone to take it all, or all the 36 or all 
the 40 hp items - give me a fair offer, i'll box and tally shipping, 
and off we go; i'm not interested in cherrypicking, but if no-one 
ponies up for all of it i'll consider it as a last resort (well, 
ebarf is the last resort).
i understand that much of this stuff might be considered junk or easy 
to find in your neck of the woods, but YMMV.
i aslo have a few 40hp cases, but those seem easier to find... pmail 
if interested.

if you ARE serious about buying, pmail me and i can dig the stuff 
back out of the boxes and provide details.
