Subject: Bus meeting in 10 days-June 30th in Long Beach
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

OK.....yes it is the SOTO meet........

Yes its the &quot;big&quot; one at Long Beach Vets Stadium

Admission is a can of pet food
(if you want to complain about it not going to a homeless shelter, Do not 
waste your time here, just donate something to the homeless shelter)

I think part of the deal to get the place was that it was free or for a 
charity
and I would rather give something to charity then to Dave....(oops) 

Anyway its a bus meet, it basically free, they have real bathrooms and a 
concession stand, its easy to get too as it right off the 405 freeway

Lots of OCTO guys are going (are there any SOTO members left in SoCal ?)

So fire up the bus and come out.....

PS....if you are going to send me any anti-Soto hate mail, I may just forward 
it to the list.....
PSS.........hey its a bus meet, just come and have some fun.....as Rodney 
said &quot;can't we all just get along&quot;.......
