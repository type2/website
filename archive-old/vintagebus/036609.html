&lt;&lt; My 55 (non barn door) pickup has front turnsignals that look like late 50s
 repros but I suspect didnt come originally.  I didnt find any evidence of
 semaphores.  Should I get rid of them when I restore it or keep them in the
 spirit of safety?
  &gt;&gt;
euro spec buses came with semaphores through about 1959.   if yours has the 
pointy turnsignals and nary a trace of a semaphore, odds are you have a N 
American  spec truck.     Means the taillights are harder to find (plastic 
bulby lens w/ two screw terminals for wires rather than the flat glass  
version with one screw terminal that there are quite a few around NOS ) but 
it really is safer and you dont have to find those pesky semaphores.
