&gt; I have a bent right side tie rod. I am looking at the replacement options and
&gt; see that there is an adjustable tie rod available. But the existing tie rod is
&gt; non adjustable. Should I stick with the non adjustable? Also is it a good idea
&gt; to replace both tie rods at the same time? The left one looks fine.
Mark,
You should be able to get one from any decent vw parts supplier. Do use
the correct non-adjustable one, with integral ends, as it is the correct
size. Halsey Automotive in Portland has them, and any vw shop that gets
parts from IMC or WAWD should be able to procure one. 
If the left looks good, and then ends are also good, leave it be.
