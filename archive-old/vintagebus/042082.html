Your roommate was a bit optomistic.  A check of the VW de Mexico website
yields a price of just under 75,000 pesos.  Using the oanda_dot_com converter
for today's rate this comes in at $7750US.

( a lot cheaper than the 13,000 those
&gt; importers ask for the new ones on old pans!) it seems logical that buying a
&gt; powerplant there for one would have to be less than the $1200 companies
&gt; charge here just for the long block.

Logic seldom prevails.  Many times I have found that the price of items in
their country of origin is higher than it is elsewhere.  People come form
Japan to buy Japanese cameras in the US!
