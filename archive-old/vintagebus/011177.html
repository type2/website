Hello all,
     Just got back from vacation in California, man am I tired.  I won't take
up time with long road trip story, in fact I'm too burnt out anyway.  I did
want to mention an incident that happened while towing my newly acquired '59
Single Cab back up to Washington (home).  While stopped for the night in a
small town called Corning, Calif. my 7 year old son Sebastian was &quot;scared&quot; by
a couple of guys eyeing the Single Cab.  Apparently while I was getting
something out of the Budget rental truck, a couple of gentlemen pulled up and
stopped to check out the bus in tow.  They drove on and Sebastian informed me
that, while stopped, they had cursed as they looked at the Single Cab on the
trailer.  When I asked him what they had said he told me &quot;BAD ASS!!&quot;  Needless
to say I explained that they probably meant it as a compliment. ;o)

Out!
