You have two options: get the &quot;closing strip&quot; that Alan sells, or do what
I've done and lay a bead all the way across the seam, fusing the two
pieces, then grinding and shaping it to make it look right.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I found that the WW lower sheet that fits behind the bumper
&gt;is almost an exact replica of the VW part including the
&gt;little angle that the upper sheet is supposed to fold over,
&gt;however, the part is not bent in the correct curve. In fact
&gt;it is dead straight. Any suggestions on a good way to bend
&gt;it down to fit the curve of the nose?
&gt;
&gt;The Schofield lower part wasn't right but Schofields repair
&gt;part for the last rusty 4 inches of the upper nose sheet
&gt;fits right onto the WW part except that S's part only has a
&gt;right angle at the bottom, not a fold over as would be
&gt;correct. Well beggars can't be choosers so I will use the
&gt;parts.  Now I need to find a way to seal the seam when I
&gt;spot weld the 2 parts together. Any suggestions?
