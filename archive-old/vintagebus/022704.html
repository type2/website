Check the rubber...if it is the expanded foam type you may be assorbing
moisture into the foam itself. This could make it less likely to compress.
It does sound like everything needs to be adjusted (seems like PO's just
readjusted the doors to compensate for failing seals instead of replacing
them)

&gt;All my rubber is new, completely around the bus.  My passenger door
&gt;closes tight.  My driver's side door closes tight but has just a little 
&gt;alignment problem in that it sticks out maybe 1/8&quot; from the body.
