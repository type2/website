Subject: Re: [VB] Which Heater?

The second heater you listed would be correct, but it's 6volt and is 
missing all the duct work that goes in to the bus. That and the switch 
are kinda hard to find. I also think that it's overpriced. I make 
replacement diaphrams for the pumps if you ever need one.

They are ads for gas powered heaters and I'm not sure which one would either be the right one for my 63 or the one that has the best track record as far as reliability? Wondering if anybody with heater experience had any input?
