Arrrgggggh,  I just got of the phone with a wrecking yard that was
supposedly had some parts that I needed but after a month of waiting and
calling and waiting and calling, they claim they lost all the parts and
can't help me out anymore... So, I look to you people...

All parts for my 59 double cab:

- front shift rod.  My bus has the shifter close to the front seat as
opposed to those after about '60 I think were the shifter is further away
from the seat.
- passenger side front door mechanism.  I have all the handles... just need
the mechanism.
- passenger door lock mechanism.  again, I have the handles, just need the
mechanism.  I believe the mechanism from a normal bus is the same.
- 2 front turn signal indicator screws (4x10 mm) with the correct clear
start portion on the screw.
- a few of the small brass screws used in the older screw terminal
electrical parts.


Can you help?

Thanks
David
