&gt; Yes. Might be a good idea to put the later model disc brakes (72 and
&gt; on) on
&gt; there when you find some in a bone yard. One year parts are more
&gt; expensive
&gt; than the multi-year and the later ones are bigger meaning a little
&gt; more
&gt; braking power.

Minor nit-picks:

'72 brakes are the same as '71, so the hot setup is '73-up.

The size and shape of the brake pads are the same for the late
calipers, so the braking power is the same.  The only difference is in
the thickness of the pads, which give longer life between pad changes. 
Unfortunately, this required changes to the spindles and rotors to make
everything fit.  Just get everything from the spindles out and you'll
do fine.

Of course, now you'll have to carry two spare tires, one wide-five and
one narrow-five.
