Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Gauge hook up

Fuse farthest to the right has power always, one fuse to the left of
this only has power when the ignition is on. That is probably the one
you want. Remember you have a bunch of ignition switch controlled
power running all over the back of the speedo, those (little black?)
wires running to the idiot lights, turn signal indicator, and then on
to the fuel gauge, I think - I don't have a wiring diagram here.
What is your chosen location for the gauge?

Subject: [VB] Oil Gauge hook up


I just received the oil temp gauge and sender from busdepot (Thanks
Ron &amp; Staff).  I have a question for those of you who use these or
have installed these.  Where do you normally hook up the hot wire from
the gauge?  I hate just splicing into a wire I pull out from behind
the dash, is there a tab on the fuse box where this can be connected
so that it only gets power when the ignition switch is on.  The last
time I hooked one of these up on my old 66, the bus had this generic
after market ignition switch with an &quot;accessory&quot; contact point hookup,
so it was easy on this one.  But we are all stock on the new 71, so
WHAT WOULD YOU DO??
