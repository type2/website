I have a couple of really great deals on buses for sale at this time.
They have to go.

1967 Westfalia Camper. Small pop top. New rebuilt 1776cc and trans.
Fresh inexpensive paint job. Only minor rust inside double doors on
entry floor. Never hit, clean body. Walk thru. Drive anywhere. $4,500
firm. A customer of mine moved back east and couldn't take this with
him. I am always reading about rusty buses that are being restored and
for the money, this non rusty bus is a killer deal. Drive now or
restore. Fly in, I will pick you up at the airport.

1967 Double cab. Please someone come with $2,500 and an engine and drive
this nice looking double cab outta here. Needs rust repair but will
serve its purpose until you can get to it. Gates are super nice and the
body is straight as an arrow. Has original seat covers and is complete.
You will be surprised at how nice this one is.

&quot;Now you know as much as I do.&quot;

Gary
