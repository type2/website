hi all,

First, the questions:

where is the best place to support the bus when you cant support it by
the beam?  I was figuring the frame crossmeber behind the beam, maybe
using a 4x4 between 2 jackstands? pad the jackstands??

also:

I have made some progress toward getting my 67 beam put in my 61 :)

i have the new beam stripped of drums, shocks and backing plates to make
it easier for me to put in weight wise. (plus i have to tear into them
anyway)

I got to the dreaded coupler and not only was it stuck, but a PO somewhere
down the line snapped off the heads of the bolts :(

I plan on welding nuts onto the ends of the remainder of the bolt  and
getting it out that way. I have been soaking them in kroil, heating,
soaking etc.

Im thinking about por15ing the undercarriage while the beam is out of the
way.  itll be the easiest time to do it as the master cylinder etc. are
all out already. I hope to get the old beam out and do the paint tomorrow,
and put the other beam in sunday.

also, i took out my glass shop cut windshields, and checked out the lower
edge of the windshield channel that tends to rust.  Happily a few minor
pits (1/32 deep max) but no holes. My friend has some spare paint of
seagull grey, so that will be nice to paint it with the right color. (i
think ill just do the windshield area, too much work to do and i want to
get it on the road.)

movin right along. got a line on some nicer interior panels &amp; a rear
seat. Ill use the rear seat for now, but i think i'll be buying a camper
bed in the near future.  Hope to get started on the engine in the next
couple of weeks, but time will tell.

peas,

Steve
