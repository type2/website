Subject: Toy alert (friday topic)

this is a friday topic, but I thought I mention it since it's such a cool deal.

Wal-Mart has a 1:24 (medium size) set called show stoppers that has a 
21-window deluxe pulling a car trailer carrying a matching '73 bug. 
REALLY cool looking and only costs $9.99!!!! There was only one at 
the Wal-Mart here &amp; I don't think they'll last long. Since it's a 
bus, it seems like the bus owners would want to grab one before the 
eBay crooks get a hold of them all. Here's a picture of mine that I'm 
gonna put up right after I send this:

p.s. See Thom, I told you I was a hypocrite.
