Subject: another engine # question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while im on this quest for the origins of my case, does anyone know of any 
links 
that break down the engine differences and specs thru the years.
im not up on the early stuff yet but trying for example , when the 40hp was 
offered.
and the 36hp, and is a 25hp a 1200?
that kind of basic info that still makes me feel stupid at times.
thanks
