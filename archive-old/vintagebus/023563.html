Southeast Bus Events

A reminder of some upcoming Southeast events.

&quot;EveryBus&quot; near Greensboro, NC next month. If you knew about this before,
recheck as there has been a change of location.

&quot;OKTOBERBUS&quot; this October near Statesville, NC. This page is getting old but
will be updated when some new details are known. Looking at adding some new
stuff this year, but not going to announce until known. Might turn out to be
very cool. :-)

Great location, great turnout, wonderful relaxing event.
