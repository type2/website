&gt; Hi Dominic,
&gt; We have seen factory bulletians pertaining to not using GL-5 as late as
when
&gt; VW owned AUDI in the 70s.    Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;

I'm using Amsoil - synthetic GL-4, expensive as h*ll actually, but cheaper
than a new tranny.  I person once suggested to me that I try a local vw
dealer or audi dealer because they should have the stuff by the drum and
should sell you a gallon at a reasonable price - I never did call one just
went with the Amsoil.
