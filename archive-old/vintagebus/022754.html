I'm sure he had up-to-date insurance and a current driver's license, too.
This is ridiculous.  Either I'm an old fogey, or there's people with too
much time on their hands or chemicals in the bloodstream.

Sorry, but I don't see how driving a bus magically absolves you of the
responibilities of the usual driver.  It's people like this piloting
garbage with a VW badge on the front that's given the hobby the bad rap.
If this is what's on the road to AZ, then I guess I should just stay home.

*This* is the bus driver of the new millenium?  Time to go Kia shopping I
guess.  

&gt;The LBB clubs choice and the Jerry Jess trophy went to Brian! (VTO) He found
&gt;a bus (57? double door) put it together,
&gt;(in 4 days)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
&gt;and drove out solo to BBB IV (350 miles one way) on. expired tags, since
&gt;1983? or thereabouts, no mirrors
&gt;or drivers seat, he sat on a chair cushion, the engine came out of his bug ,
&gt;which is his daily driver and hadn't had a tune-up since Jerome in
&gt;September, his fuel line plugged on the way out, so he punched a hole in his
&gt;gas tank and ran the fuel line trough it, front pressed bumper was there but
&gt;not bolted and 4 miss matched tires, but he made it, Now there is a loyal
&gt;BBB follower, he'd make it no matter what and he did. There's more but I'm
&gt;sure the stories will get around, like the cop who let him off for expired
&gt;tags after he heard his stories. A huge KUDOS for Brian the bus driver of
&gt;the new millennium.
