Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Notch your rods, install a windage tray, use a large remote oil filter
and add a remote oil cooler.
You can also add a 1.5 Oil Pan to your existing pan.
Install a Oil Pressure Gauge, Oil Temperature Gauge, Cylinder Head
Temperature Gauge.
All of these things should cost in the neighborhood of $250.00 but well
worth the effort and investment.
I have these things on a 1776 that I'm running.
