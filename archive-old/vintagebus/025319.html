The Beverly Hippies’ Great Adventure
~Or~
On the Road Again
Dave Jersey:
As promised, 1 trip report.

Did the small going away lunch, got my final evals from the Miami gig,
and took the train to where the Tinkertoy waited, loaded with all the
Wife’s roses &amp; other plants, 1 parrot, 1 iguana (with pen), and basic
road spares.  Body Bags with sleeping bags etc. secured to the roof
rack.  Waited around for the wife to arrive with kids freshly sprung
&gt;from school.  Good-byes all around to the neighbors who were home, and
on the road again!  With my daughter running co-pilot we chuffled off to
the north.

Took the Florida Turnpike to avoid traffic (yeah right).  Paid the
required small fortune in quarters until we took the ticket to ride.
Just get settled in, running 60 – 65 M.P.H., oil temp a happy 190.  Then
the light show happened.  Condestruction on a bridge, everybody’s
supposed to merge to the right lane.  Unfortunately, merge in Miami
means go as far and as fast as you can in the closed lane then zoom into
the open one.  Of course that means that nobody goes anywhere until the
trucker in the brown Freighthauler took up both lanes.  Gave him homage
on the CB and off we went again. Weather wasn’t too bad, clear skies but
a fair headwind that worked itself up to 25 mph.  As time went by, oil
temp began creeping up.  Had to give her more pedal too.  Gas stops
every 170 miles (running out sucks).  Noticed the body bags had fluffed
up into sails so the combination of 25 mph headwind and extra sails
meant more pedal, and more work meaning more heat in the oil.  Tucked
them back down as best I could, only another 45 minutes to go until we
stop for the night anyway.  Hit the Motel 6, dinner and argue about how
to repack the Tinkertoy.  The motel almost got 8 free rosebushes.

Next day, up early, check points gap and timing.  Points closed .001”,
timing spot on once points set properly.  Repacked the Tinkertoy so that
the only thing on top was the propane tank for the grill.  Didn’t bring
the grill though.  Waffle House for breakfast and off we go.  Still got
the headwind but without the sail the Tinkertoy’s much happier.
Overcast and threatening rain, real cool so oil temp about 160 running a
steady 65 mph.  Weather keeps getting worse, the rain hits.  Knew I
shoulda hooked up the heat while I was up in Ct.  Heidi and I getting
cold, the rain isn’t coming in through the windshield seals, but it sure
does rain in everywhere else.  Ought to fix that huh?  Hit the 1st Motel
I see in Charleston, jump in a hot shower, put the Iguana in the tub to
warm her up, and we’re here!  Uneventful trip huh?

Heidi Jersey:
Day 1: Hey!  I get to decipher incomprehensible messages from the
truckers, who give us useful information concerning traffic and road
conditions.  This was originally recorded in a small book of mine when
Dad asked me to write it down.  Said something about promising the
buddies in the VW club a report on the Tinkertoy’s status down the
road.  Stays 55-60 mostly, we can’t do much better (it’s a ’67 bus,
recently restored with a 1600 cc single port.  They don’t go too
fast.).  Same malfuscitation Dad spoke about, cleared up pretty quick.
Honestly, with the wind in my hair, amusement from Dad’s and the
Trucker’s comments, and absolute lack of boredom, I wouldn’t trade this
for whatever anyone’s going to trade with me.  Heard about a problem
around Palm City, cleared it for Dad and heard Mom ask if the
Hippiemobile needed gas.  Sure enough, we stopped to fill it up.

Pine has rapidly replaced palm, an old friend I haven’t seen much since
leaving the North.  Few palms here and there, not frequent, though.
There’s a dark overcast, but I don’t think it’ll rain, though I’m
probably wrong.

Dad screamed his favorite motto over the CB, and someone replied.  Dad’s
motto?  “Yeehaw!”  I couldn’t quite figure out what our friend said, but
he was in good spirits.  The Bus is doing well, much better than it did
when we took it to Miami from Massachusetts.  We towed it on that little
adventure.  We passed a grapefruit orchard, the wind shifted as well.
Being pushed in all directions, from trucks passing to natural airflow.

Day 2: Started about 9:00 AM, discovered the great fabled “Palm City
Problem” that was short but just enough to make the bad drivers worse.
Ease through it and everything will be okay, right people?  They seem to
be immune to common sense, which my family and I have found to be not
very common at all.

Houston, we have rain, our lucky streak has just left us in the dust.
But lo and behold, we have our little back up pot o’ luck- Dad’s magic
Rain-X (highly recommended for leakers, batteries not included.) that
prevented us some heartache.  ?  Glad for my sweater, but I am still
colder than a frozen headless chicken.

Wind forces Westerly, the drop of temperature only makes us happy
because it signifies a ? Bus and the North, but that’s about it.  Ours
is a wind-cooled engine.  Saw an old Karmann Ghia convertible, that’s
pretty cool (jiggy, dude!).  Gosh, that wind plays with us like a
pinball.

Got through Georgia, but it didn’t warm up.  Gas stops; 2 so far.
Exited for gas again, got to the Econo Lodge in Goose Creek, South
Cacalacie.  This is my new home?  I’m not complaining, far from it, in
fact.  Y’all have a nice life now, Y’hear?
