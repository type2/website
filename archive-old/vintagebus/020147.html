Prepping the 67 bus for this weekend's Flat Four
Fetish sponsored Prescott show. 

Our brakes are *embarrassingly* loud. 

Tonight I will be &lt;again&gt; tearing down the front my
family &lt;my wallet&gt; paid phenomenal dollars to a local
big deal high dollar resto/race vw shop to do the
brakes and clutch on the bus. My health and time were
non-existent at that moment. The wife impressed upon
me that I shouldn't have to do ALL of the maintenance
on all of the buses and to give myself a break. &lt;no
pun intended&gt;. I have taken it back three times for
mushy brake pedal, clutch readjust and front brakes
that howl at the moon when applied.
The answer that I got from the shop is that due to the
lack of asbestos and increased metal content in the
shoes &quot;they all howl like that&quot;.
I have torn it down once before to find glazed shoes
and drums. Took rough sand paper to the drum and shoes
and cleaned,reassembled,readjusted and put the bus
back into service. The noise was minimized but not
eliminated. I have not had the time to get back into
it prior to tonight's planned exercise.

Question 1: Given that the drums were turned with
fresh shoes, grease seals plus correct
adjustment-bleeding what &lt;besides riding the brakes or
too close of an adjustment&gt; would cause the apparent
glazing of the shoes and resultant noises?

Question 2: Are the shoes on most of your buses front
brakes howling/screaming like dusty Volvo disc brakes?

Question 3: Am I normal? ;-) Oops, I mean is this
noise the now typical/acceptable norm of your buses?

Common sense tells me that this is not right or
acceptable. What's the consensus?
