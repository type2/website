&gt; Hey all, I had the same problem for years with having to crawl
&gt; under my DC to start it.  I tried bebuilt starters one after the other.
&gt; I was finally told of a relay, made by Bosch, that would solve the
problem.
&gt; I don't know the part number.  Anyone out there know off hand what it is?



The 12 volt version is a WR1, the 6 volt version a 113 998 911.  Both are on
my website.
