Subject: Sperrwolf gear shift lock.....

The original Sperrwolf gear shift lock is the way to go in my opinion.

Can be disassembled, but you need it unlocked by the key to do so if the
memory serves me correctly. You lose the key and I think you'll need a
sledgehammer or equivalent to get it apart. So a little more classy then a
bolt that shears the head.

I was lucky to find and acquire an NOS unit many years ago for my convertible
where it still resides to this day. So still have the spacer needed for a bus
application. You definitely need the spacer for to install in a bus if you
should find one of these locks.
