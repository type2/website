&gt;Subject: redux box questions
(snip)
&gt;I began the extremely arduous task of tapping the holes for the 
&gt;bigger bolts which went off okay until on the last hole (the furthest front 
&gt;one) on the last turn of the tap, the tap snapped off in the hole. 
&gt;
&gt;Now the next week was spent trying to remove that tap, there is a special 
&gt;tool for that with 4 rods that slide up the side of the tap etc, but nothing 
&gt;would work. Bits would just shatter. The special tool also broke.

Chris,

	I have found from e-z outing many bolts at work (and having a fair
amount of e-z outs break off) that all that is often needed is to apply
some heat from a small propane torch prior to trying to drill through
it.  After getting it nice and hot, let it cool off on it's own.  By
doing this you've in effect &quot;de-tempered&quot; the e-z out/tap and now you
should be able to drill through it as easily as any normal steel with a
good drill bit (&quot;easily&quot; being used VERY loosely ;-) ).  I've never had
the pleasure(?) of drilling out a tap before, but the process I
described should work the same since e-z outs and taps are virtually
made from the same type of kryptonite.  I personally use carbide drill
bits.  While they are initially pricey, you couldn't pay me to go back
to those standard ol' black things.  As always, YMMV  Good luck.
