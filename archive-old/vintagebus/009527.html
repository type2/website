It seams that mine would take as long probably. Time and money are two very
important factors when you work on a Bus. Got to have both. It looks as
though as soon as Thom lays his eyes on a nice resto candidate he can't stop
working 'round the clock 'till it's finished. I wish I had this much free
time on my hands. Being your own boss is not easy you know. I just got some
sheet metal from BFY today, my welder is on it's way and I already bought a
twelve pack of Heineken for this coming weekend so me and my friend - former
body man can continue our task of getting rid of all the rust holes and
dents on my '63 Micro. I'd say that this would be the most difficult part of
all. I'm working on the engine in the meantime and on all the small parts I
took off the bus and bought so far. It all should be ready when body is
done. Hope to have it done soon. Though I'm going with a slightly different
color (why is everybody going RED on their buses??), mine is gonna be
Porsche Red and only at $50.00 a gallon. Not too bad. Keep progress updates
coming, it's getting interesting. This Japanese guy might be just watching
the list for them and then try and buy our buses for his exporting
business???? Heck, I wouldn't sell after all the work!!!!

('63 Micro - Magic)

&gt; Hey list---
&gt; With the recent popularity of bus updates, I thought I'd share a bit of my
&gt; story with you!
&gt;
&gt; I've had my '59 panel since Oct. '98 and it really got me into the vintage
&gt; thing. So it sat in my garage for a few months while I admired the PO
attempt
&gt; at a house on wheels. We are talking hacked corner windows (not the VW,
but
&gt; the bubble '70's windows), a hacked bubble window hatch, an air
conditioner
&gt; on the roof, a skylight vent, hacked flared wheel wells, hacked late model
&gt; taillights, a smashed rear bumper/apron/corner, newspaper filled rockers
and
&gt; the list goes on . . . A big project huh?  Thank god my buddy Neil is a
body
&gt; man and he decided to take on the resto as I'm not a body man(You'll prob
&gt; give me some grief but I'm learning!)  Anyway----
&gt;
&gt; With 9 months on and off of metal work and block sanding (and ALOTof
working
&gt; for the $), finally the bus is paint ready. So off to the paint shop we
went
&gt; last week. I about had a coronary when I found out the price on my PPG
&gt; products. Oh my goodness is Sealing Wax Red expensive(thanks for the PPG
code
&gt; lou (vwdragon)!
&gt; I left w/ 2 gallons of Sealing Wax Red, 2 gallons of clear, 1 qt of
&gt; silver/white, 2 quarts of grey for interior, 1 qt of black, and all the
&gt; neccessary reducers/hardeners. . . Even the guy at the paint store looked
so
&gt; suprised at the total that he cut 15% off of the cost so I wouldn't
choke!!:)
&gt;
&gt; So now the time has come to have the fun in the resto------
&gt;
&gt; I'll keep you posted and hopefully get a small pic site up when it's
&gt; complete!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for venting but I needed it and I like reading about others restos
&gt; BTW----Thom? How the hell do you do it ?  You've whipped out 2 before
mines
&gt; even painted!:)
&gt;
&gt; Take care everyone---
&gt; Pete
