Thanks again, Clara.  It's funny that you mention computer problems, mine went
up in smoke soon after I emailed you and others!  I smelled this electronic
burning smell, and then I couldn't make the mouse or keyboard work.

The info as always was very detailed and should point me in the right
direction.  My bus is a '66, so I'll be able to glean what I need based on
this.  I have to get my engine number now...

Hi Paul, due to computer problems, I unfortunately do not have the ability to

look at pictures.

So, if I understand, you want to know whether the prehat pickup should be on 
the right or the left, and 
where you can find the pickup tube.
