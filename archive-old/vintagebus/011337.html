I am on a business trip in Thailand.  I have come across a couple
cool buses that the owners are willing to sell.  One is a 66
Kombi the other is a 67 deluxe.  They are both Right Hand Drive
(RHD) as Thailand is a RHD country.  They also have a sliding
cargo door on the left hand side rather than the standard swinging
cargo doors.  Both are complete including the middle seats. The
Kombi is a daily driver, the deluxe is without a motor. The only
hack is to the bumpers and apron for a beetle exhaust.  I'll
try to get pictures posted soon.

I have researched shipping out of Thailand, but have not checked
on the US for import.  Does anyone know what the requirements
are for importing these RHD buses into the US (california)? 
Thom, how was your bus brought in?

Thanks,

Jeff Grant - San Diego (now in Hat Yai) 63 Deluxe
