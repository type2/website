 Hello list,
 Before we let this thread die....
 what was the last air/oil cooled production engine and what oil did it
 run?
 Were synthetics available at the time?
 It doesn't seem that the oil manufactures would research such an esoteric
 use of their product; unless a automotive manufacturer worked with them. 
 Thanks
 Ken
