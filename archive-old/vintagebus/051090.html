Subject: RE:  Delivery Date Camper and Commercial Mag

  WOW, Camper and Commercial is sold out again. I have 25 copies coming and
will try to up the order again. Everyone who has e-mailed me is on the list
and will be receiving there's when they arrive around March 18th. I will
notify those that have e-mailed me after 11;00 am AZ. time today and let you
know if I can still get more. I don't see any problem. 
   This will be ongoing and I will also be receiving issue 7 when available
and will notify all that purchased number 6.
   I also will be receiving the NEW BUS SPEC guides when ready


PS the new Split Bus spec guide in full colour hardback 92pp is out in May!
WOW..just sorting the final colour proof..400+ piccies...lots of real new
stuff and buses not senn much as well...
