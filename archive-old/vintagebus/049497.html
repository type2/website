Subject: Re: M 544 code--

&gt;Also the dating chart says this bus was an April bus but the build
&gt;&gt;date shows 16th of May. Does the M code plate get stamped upon completion of
&gt;&gt;the build or during?? or is it when ready for delivery?
&gt;ronnie


we've had this debate before... my single cab has an 06 4  date on the
mplate (which should be april 6, 65), yet Stiftung sent me a build date of
may 5-11, 1965. chassis # is 265 148 182, which puts it AFTER or LATE april
65 at best. so i came to the conclusion that the plate was stamped when the
vehicle was    'ordered'  by the factory (so many this month to be kombis,
so many to be campers, etc).   the plate then likely sat around while
waiting for frame completion, or was affixed the the body, but the work was
not done till later. this would explain why the 'build date' is later.  i
do wonder if this only applies to specialty models - anyone else have a lag
between date stamp and Stiftung dates?

other speculations: hans punched the wrong number  when making the plate
(too mach lager at break), Stiftung is wrong, or sumpin' else!
