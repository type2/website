Oh Brian!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shouldn't have gone there..................
You Wrote:
&quot;There are some of us out here in St. Louis, and various members of the &quot;Bus
Butts&quot; club that whole-heartedly believe in the theory that any AVAILABLE
woman who drives a Vw bus is clinically insane.&quot;

First of all as a Doctoral Candidate in Clinical Psychology. A woman or a man
for that matter can not be declared &quot;clinically insane&quot; unless the behavior or
psychosis observed and assessed is described in the DSM III or IV. This is the
&quot;shop manual&quot; for Psychologists. 

If I can make any sense out of your convoluted logic and random ramblings. It
seems that you are suggesting that if a woman appreciates Volkswagen Buses for
any other reason other than to try and trap her a man... she is insane.

It seems to me that your ramblings suggest some sort of Schizoid behavior.
Your obvious &quot;problem&quot; with women liking a hobby that you have associated with
the male architype suggests that you have some Freudian developmental problem
that causes you to question your own gender identity. You are probably lash
out at women in inappropriate ways to bolster and affirm your male ego. The
St. Louis Butthead club that you belong to probably has like members and
repressed homosexual tensions( Any Gay List members who are comfortable with
their sexuality please don't take offence). In conclusion I would like to
diagnose you as a certified A HOLE. Unfortunately that classification is not
in the DSM. So unfortunately I will have to be content with suggesting
Dellusional with Aggressive Disorder.

My suggested intervention requires the assistance of other female Listees

I will Hold him down

Barb -- you punch and Kick him 

Michelle -- you verbally abuse him

Clara -- you can finish him off with an ARC Welder!!!!

This thread is going no where fast. But at least the women of the list HAVE an
opportunity to respond to their sensless bashing unlike some others who have
recently been defamed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
