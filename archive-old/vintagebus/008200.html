I wanted to also add that at the original URL I posted, if you go to the
bottom of the page, there are more pages of documents.  The original URL
only referenced 2 pages.  I believe I look at over 40 pages of info.  It
seems that the high mileage carbs are NOT urban legend although there is a
lot of myth and legend woven in and out of the stories.  I guess one can say
that carbs that take a different approach to atomizing fuel do exists as
well as the higher mileage that comes from them.  I kind of believe the big
oil mogul stories now.  If you were one of them, you'd want to quelch this
kind of info.  Easy to do when you all the cash you could ever want.  Just
pay people to shut up. :-)
