Subject: RE: [VB] cb performance sump filter

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=202

&quot;just saw this in vwtrends... a paper filter that replaces the mesh one in
the oil sump. any thoughts on this? my first thought is restricting the
suction side of the pump is a no-no, but maybe other motors do this w/ no
probs. also, i wonder why vw didn't do this - before they went to full-flow,
that is. &quot;


I agree that it may restrict the pickup tubes suction capabilities.  After
all in a typical oil filter it is filtering under high pressure directly
from the oil pump.

If I remember correctly this product sticks out the bottom a couple of
inches which could affect ground clearance if it is a concern.

My theory is that VW did not incorporate a regular paper oil filter because
the engines would die from other causes before small crud particles would
eat it away to fail.  Also with oil changes at every 3,000 the oil will
remain very clean.

Personally I like the Maxi Pump 3:

Off of this you can run a normal oil filter adapter with SS hose...  And no
it does not leak oil like other filter pumps.  The only downfall is that the
gears are aluminum and will wear somewhat quickly compared to stock steal
gears.
