   Hello fellow volks folks. I hope everyone had a great Christmas. I
figured I would write and brag about the cool VW related gifts I
received. My sister Led the pack with some wonderful things including a
stepping stone that she meticulously hand painted bernice  (my 65 bus)
on, under my bus it says &quot;Herzlich Willkommen&quot; which you may or may not
know translates to &quot;A heartfelt welcome&quot;. She also got me a tin sighn
with the original mass transit add on it, very cool gift indeed! My mom
struck gold with a metal shift knob that looks like a little splitty,
its really neat and well detailed. Last but not least my aunt and uncle
got me two of the three &quot;Endangered Species&quot; photographs. One depicts
type 2s, the other bugs and a ghia. I already have the third in the
series showing a line up of early split window bugs.
      I hope everyone had a happy holiday season. Now get back to work!!
