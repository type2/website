&gt;Has anyone ever put a 5 speed (non porsche) tranny in their bus?  Is

I have a 5-speed tranny that I bought for a friend a couple of years ago
who was looking for one to put into his Devin that he races in vintage
races.  He decided to stick with a 4-speed, because he stays in 3rd &amp;
4th most of the time anyway.  When I bought it, I was told it was a
Berg 5-speed, but I think it is actually a CB Performance 5-speed.  I
bought it from a friend who was going to put it in a Ghia project, but he
sold the project before he put it in, so it has never been run.  It still had
the tag on it when I bought it.  I don't remember if it is swingaxle or 
irs...
I would have to dig it out of the garage &amp; see.

I would trade the 5-speed...  &quot;In trade I would like your double door seat
(for jimmy) and the sloped westy rack, a side step, and a ladder to
compliment it all if possible.&quot;

The part in quotations is a direct quote, and an inside joke that only
one person will get...  ;)

It has to be Friday somewhere in the world, but the tranny part is no joke.
