Subject: What kind of pop-top?

I salvaged a straight-up pop top from a bay window bus. It looked like a
shade-tree job, not well finished. Now, looking at the WCM glovebox
catalog, I see that there was a &quot;square&quot; pop top for 68-72 bays,
referred to as a European model.
Anyway, could someone measure their top and compare it to what I have?
I measured the very top, not the sealing edge, and got 40&quot; x 44&quot;.
Thanks,
  Oh, just put in some seat-stand mats from Wolfsburg West. Nice fit,
looks great!
