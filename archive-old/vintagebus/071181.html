Subject: RE: [VB] working bus

Routinely this summer, I've been hauling compost and wood chips from our
local 'MRF' (material recovery facility) to various friend's gardens in
the tipper.  The most I had was about 2200 lbs in it.  The first few
times the guy in the loader kept looking at me funny when I kept
motioning him to put more in.  Now they don't bat an eye but the lady at
the scales several times has told me she wont allow American made trucks
loaded to that point... seems a few have busted springs and blown tires.
I just smile and drive off... of course I keep it under 80km/hr when
it's loaded like that.

... unloading is the fun part of course when you just pump up the bed
and watch it all slide out.  Now that's working!
