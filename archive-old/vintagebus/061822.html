FYI here's a link to an MG (the British car, that is) parts supplier in
Massachusetts that sells Waxoyl:

http://www.propermg_dot_com/wax104.htm

It's available with a pump sprayer, or as an aerosol.  It seems to be
like a mixture of mineral spirits, beeswax, and machine oil.

&gt; Just get some of that waxy undercoating the Brits spray all over
&gt; the bottom of their cars.  I forget the name, but it is basically a
&gt; sprayable wax.  A light coat should work fine.  Sprayable cosmoline or
&gt; something like it should work too.

&gt; The name is Waxoil made by Finnegans I believe.
