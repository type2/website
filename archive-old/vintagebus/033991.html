&lt;&lt; I am trying to compose some Facts and opinions on Why so many T4 valve 
seats drop and T1 #3 exhaust valve heads pop off seemingly new condition 
engines  &gt;&gt;

Hi Jamie,
We think it probably is due to one or more likely a combination of:
1.  Since the freeway speed limit went from 55 MPH max speed limit to 60, 70, 
and higher the ACVW engines now are being pushed up to higher RPMs where due 
to more fuel air being burned per minute the cooling surfaces of the heads 
and cylinders can not keep up especially during warmer summer weather.  Used 
to be type 4 engines in the much heavier late model type 2s would easily go 
200,000+ miles and quite often over 300,000 miles before needing a rebuild 
when 55 MPH was the speed limit nation wide.
2.  Newer fuel are comming out with oxygenated chemistry so the engines need 
bigger idle, main jets and smaller air correction jets to keep the air/fuel 
mixture from getting too lean.  For the FI engines the AFMs and head temp 
sensors to name a few parts are getting older and more worn.  Since it is 
getting harder to find parts and mechanics who know what is what in these 
systems things are going to get worse.
3.  Engine cases and heads have more often been rebuilt several times by now 
and because of this are either worn or due to this wear have been flycut 
where the cylinders are mounted against these parts.  Resulting in higher 
compression ratios, hotter running engines and more detonation due to the 
assembler of the newly rebuilt engine not checking the head and cylinder 
measurements to establish the compression ratio.
