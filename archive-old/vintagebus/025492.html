Subject: Spiders, I hate spiders!

Hi all,

Ok, Maybe this is a little off subject, as it doesn't relate to the
mechanics of our beloved vehicles, but it is related.  As you may or may
not recall, I search and rescued a 65 standard.  And while I love
working on it and it is currently garaged, which I also like, the
spiders also seem to like it.  The most frequent incounter is the
harmless daddy long legs, I have also had two encounters with the big
red hourglass BAS#*RDS (Black Widows).  I understand the hole
occupational bus rustoration hazard, but I HATE them.  To be honest, I
couldn't even watch that Arachnophobia movie.  BLAAAAAAHHHH  Maybe this
is a little wussy and not the norm of Carbs and redux rebuilds, but it
is a bus related problem.

I planned on just buying a few of those bug bombs and letting them rip
through the garage killing everything in or around, but thought I would
consult the collective list for any tricks of the trade.  I have three
more wheels to pull and expect many more encounters.

Thanks,
Aaron,

Both in the same garage with the damn spiders.
