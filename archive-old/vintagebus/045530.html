 Any tranny with  dual side plates can accept bus reduction box

 Nope, no way.  1969-1972 were dual side cover Type I IRS.   A
 different animal from the earlier swingaxles.  Now, you can convert
 a IRS back to a Swingaxle and then the '69-'72s will work. But
 they won't work if they are still IRS.
