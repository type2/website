&gt; Scott brought up a good one.
&gt;   How many of us carry work clothes and a work mat in our buses, or do we
&gt; all believe that our buses don't break and don't need them?

I usually carry everything needed to pull the engine and transmission, on
the theory that if I carry it I won't need it.  I have made it a habit to
carry several pairs of vinyl exam gloves.  Very nice if one has to do some
minor engine work on the way to a soiree.
