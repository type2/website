Slowing down to a crawl certainly works.
The other thing you can do is pull out the light knob
so the parker lamps come on &amp; look like your braking.
A bit of a decrease in speed &amp; a few erratic flashes
of those parkers and the dude in the big block or
H_at_nda behind you will start to worry about his paint
job &amp; either get the hell around you or slow down.
Works well I've found.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
