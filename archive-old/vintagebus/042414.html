&gt; BTW, what is a good chrome polish on the market?

Hapisch Simichrome is the bomb!  Made in germany taboot!

available at any good motorcycle store and nowhere else i've veer seen, it
will make your chrome look like a mirror!

and on this subject... i have some slightly pitted chrome, i realize teh
best way to fix this is to rechrome, but i just want it to look better...
can i use steel wool or ?? to make the pits less obvious? (really right
now they are sticking up above the level of the chrome and are rust
colored... kinda like tiny bubbles.  If i can at least get the bubbles
knocked off it'd be a great step forward.)

thanks,

Steve
