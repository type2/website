Thanx for the info on the 1600 engine,  bug vs. bus.  My intention here is
to build up a spare motor so for my next question, &quot;What do you look for
when inspecting a used case and are some cases better than others?&quot;  I'll be
looking for info on tools, engine stands,  and sources for parts also.  I
have read that the single port, 1600 engine would be a good choice for my
67Westy.  Thank you all for your comments.
