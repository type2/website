&lt;&lt; Wasn't the Puck designed to be towed by a 36? Has anyone tried it? I've
 been curious about doing just that...towing a Puck with a 36. Not that I
 have a Puck, or a running 36 right now for that matter...but hopefully this
 weekend I'll solve the latter problem. &gt;&gt;

If you have a long time to get to where you are going I guess you could do 
it.  I have a 1776 in my crew cab and really wish I had more when fighting a 
headwind and going up hill while towing my Puck.
