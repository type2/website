Subject: Re: 61 S/C Teaser

A friend just called and he is towing home a 61 S/C weekend after
next ( Aug. 1st ) and it is for sale. Says it is super straight,
including gates, cargo doors on each side, new seat covers, both
bumpers. Only negatives are no motor, and cut out for large radio.
Has clean calif title and he wants $1000.00 OBO. Throw in a 1600
and you have a neat S/C for $1500.00. Email and I will forward your
phone number if you are interested, he has no computer.
SEE YOU IN HAVASU JAN 1999.
