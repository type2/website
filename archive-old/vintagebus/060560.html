Subject: Re: [VB] spare tire in a NON-Walkthrough

Hi Volks, 
Thus the reason we run a 165SR15 tire as a spare!  It fits in all bus spare 
positions wether walk thru or not.  We use the spare just to get to the next 
availible tire store in about 500 miles.  Using differant sized tires on the 
rear axle for long periods can ruin a differential, and on the front axle 
results in a little less stable handling in corners.
