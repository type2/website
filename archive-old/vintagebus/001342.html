I hope you all don't mind these nightly updates.  I'm hoping that it will
show just what goes into getting a bus running and on the road again.  Just
imagine if I was doing a show stopper bus - heck - I'd never get done!

Tonight I didn't make it over to the shop because of a stoopid store meeting
I had to attend.  Those things are long, boring, and full of the deep stuff.
The only good thing is the free pizza.

Due to my late start, I was only able to get a few things done.  Backing up
a little bit, over noon hour I managed to pull the arm off of the steering
box.  It took the 3 jaw wheel puller, wd40 and some head from the torch and
it came off.  The jaws kept slipping off of the arm so I used a couple of
hose clamps around the jaws to keep them tight on the swingarm.  Worked
great.  Then tonight I was able to clean to bare metal (due to the
protection of a lot of grease!) the clutch lever and pedal, brake lever and
pedal, misc bolts from the steering box assembly brackets, throttle &quot;L&quot;
lever, MC pushrod (ran a tap through the threads to clean them up), front
lug nuts, and various other hardware bits.  Then I took a timeout and went
out to Walmart to buy some Brakleen with which to spray the parts to prep
them for paint.  I also had to grab an AMC model of the General Lee from the
Dukes of Hazzard, some Lava soap to replenish grandma's supply, and some
latex gloves.

After getting back home, I took steering box assembly and ran the tube
through the wire wheel.  This in effect cleaned off all the scuff marks,
rust, ruined paint, etc. and now I have a bare metal steering box tube.  I
also removed the bracket on the side of the box and discovered a little lead
plate tag with a wire through it.  It read ZF which I thought was cool.
There is a blue seal in this output area of the box - I'll have to order
that as well as it is looking a bit leaky.  Using an old rag and some duct
tape, I totally sealed off the steering wheel end of the the tube and the
output shaft area of the steering box.  Tomorrow I'll get the beam, steering
box, and bracket sandblasted.  It's all prepped and ready to be worked on.

That was pretty much it.  I gotta hit the sack so goodnight...
