Subject: Re: [VB] quick tire question

&gt;&gt; tires, exotic 16-ply specialty tires, etc, what size tires should I get
&gt;for
&gt;&gt; my 15&quot; wheels?  I want to get them tomorrow or the next day in prep for
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; trip to KP.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I run 165-15, which is very close to the stock size. When I bought them (at
&gt;Costco) the guy called them Volkswagen tires.

155SR15 would be right for early 15&quot; Beetle, which came with 5.60-15 tires
(usually Continental).

165SR15 is correct for late (around '73 up) Beetle/Super Beetle, which came
with 6.00-15 (I've seeen Continental and Semperit) and then 165SR15 (late
convertibles had Continental TS771) tires.

15&quot; Split Buses came with 6.40-15 tires, so a 175SR15 should be correct.
These seem like an odd size, but a Michelin XZX 6PR tire was factory on
Volvo wagons sold here in the early 70s.  MIchelin and others must still
make such a tire, but they might not market it in the States any more.
Still, 175SR 15 will be the closest for speedo accuracy, ground clearance,
etc.

14&quot; Split Buses came with 7.00-14 tires, and there is much info on the
website about the correct 185SR14 tire to use.  No need to go into it here.

P.S.  If you're interested in wider tires, consider that tires with no
aspect ratio in the size are assumed to be about 80% as tall as they are
wide (in section).  To go from an 80 series tire to a 70 series tire, and
still maintain roughly the same diameter, add 20mm.  Example: a 165SR15 and
a 185/70SR15 tire are about the same diameter.  To go to a 60 series tire,
add another 30mm.  Example: a 165SR15, 185/70SR15, and 215/60HR15 are all
about the same diameter.

To put this into Bus perspective, look for a 175SR15, 185/75R15, or
195/70SR15 for your factory 15&quot; Bus wheels.  Look for 185SR15, 195/75R14,
or 205/70SR15 tires for your factory 14&quot; Bus wheels.  Don't worry too much
about the speed rating (the 'S', 'T', 'H', or 'V' in the size).  And keep
in mind that the so-called 'P Metric' sized tires have the speed rating
AFTER the dimensions, not in the middle of them.  Even the crappiest
non-speed rated tires are still required by the D.O.T. to meet an 85 MPH
speed standard.  More than enough for our applications.
