&gt;I have to correct one thing that NQ reported. The 1st place award for
Splitties
&gt;was not won by Brad's beautiful bus. It was won by ME! Was it a &quot;gift&quot; for
hard work?


I like Frodo better anyways Terry!

As Terry stated, he did win first place and I do stand corrected.  I wrote
the post when it was late so that was my botchup.  Terry deserved first for
the effort for sure. :-)

Later!

NQ
