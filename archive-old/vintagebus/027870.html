Subject: pushrod tubes

Hey all,
Just wondering about sprung push rod tubes.  Are these any worse than
regular push rod tubes?  I've seen plastic and metal versions, and I'd
opt for the metal ones, but maybe the plastic ones are better?  It seems
like these would be better for faster oil leak repairs be it roadside or
in the garage.  Its a real pain in the rear having to pull the motor,
and all the tin and head to replace a pushrod tube or seal.
What do you guys think?
