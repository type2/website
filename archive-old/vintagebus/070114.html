Subject: Re: [VB] Got that shift rod out!

Yay!!!! glad you busted it loose.

Just remember to put a 'dust boot&quot; at each end of your shift rod tube!!!!  If you dont feel like paying for a repro, I have successfully used old brake cylinder dust covers and a hose clamp round the big tube... cut center hole to fit rod.   

I have NEVER seen a bus with the boots in good shape unless they were replaced.  Did your bus live in a salt zone at some time?

As your bus loves grease and grease is good, liberally grease the rod and the ouside of the shuttlecock bushings before putting the rod back in.

&gt; What's crazy is 80% of the rod is nice shiny metal. It was just that 
&gt; 6-12 inches at the front that was all rusted and at least a 
&gt; part of 
&gt; it was rusted to the tube.
