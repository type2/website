Subject: Question


I had a rather detailed question I was hoping you could help me with.  It
concerns my 65 21 window.

I am in the process of refurbishing my headlight buckets.  I need to
repaint the inside of the headlight bucket and want to get the correct
color.  Wolfsburg West has a paint L91 &quot;Chrome Color&quot;; is this the correct
color?

If not, do you know the correct color and where I might be able to purchase
it.

Thanks a bunch!

Tim
