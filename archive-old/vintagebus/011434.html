Subject: door/kick panel covering needed

&gt; From: Cal Grant &lt;cjay_at_well_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Subject: door/kick panel covering needed

&gt; Has anyone out there in listland been able to find the thin vinyl
&gt; (.020&quot;) covering material used to recover the visible sides of
&gt; the kick panels and door panels. My 67 deluxe had 'platinum'
&gt; vinyl, a slightly metallic light bronze color, along with the
&gt; salt and pepper middle area on the door panels. I seek the
&gt; platinum or some similar colored vinyl covering with the same

I know the problem...same as my '67.  When I went to reupholster
mine, I spent hours in a large auto upholstery shop in Rockford,
Illinois trying to match the platinum.  I did finally find
something VERY close, both in color and thickness, to the VW
original.  Two problems with it though.  It only came in the
&quot;thin&quot; version so I couldn't use it for the seats.  Also, it was
$50/yard or something like that.  I passed.

One word of note, the guy said the reason it was so expensive is
that it was for a Cadillac of 50s vintage.  He didn't get
specific, but that may give someone a clue.

&gt; thickness (0.020&quot;), as anything thicker won't  allow the kick
&gt; panels to fit properly into the lower flanges and still get
&gt; around the headlights. I am using the Wolfsburg West panels and
&gt; don't want to settle for the grey finish they come with.

I understand the &quot;don't want to settle&quot; idea.  If you do find the
right color, the panels can be sanded down around the headlight
buckets and the channel at the bottom can be widened a bit to get
a good fit.  If the panel goes down far enough to &quot;seat&quot;, the
headlight hole will align properly.
