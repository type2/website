&gt;Wade, what part of the world do you live in?
Arizona USA

&gt;Those sound like good prices for what I want.
Well actually it was the most expensive bumper shop in my area &quot;Metro
plating®&quot;. I was hoping the price would match the quality....(Although they
told me &quot; Its just a f*ckin VW!!!  It doesn't have to be perfect!!! &quot; like
the other 2 other places i went said) They claimed they had the patterns for
it (uh-huh) but i gave it back 3 times cause the rear was tweaked everytime
and still had dents in it. They also said over and over &quot; oh your lucky we
saved it!!! &quot; ....yah ok.

&gt;I don't want chrome, but I assume that a chrome shop is the best place to
go to get them as smooth as they should be.
Thats where i went. But i seemed to not be so important to them cause I
didnt want it chromed.

&gt;Also, what style bumpers did you have straightened?
Ribbed pressed bumpers for my 57 single cab

And no i wont go back. Which also means im out of bumper shops in AZ. Time
to start takin my stuff down to cali like the rest of the ppl I know are
doin to get some quality work.
