Yeah, I've heard nothing but good things about BBB and I really want to 
make it this year.  But with a new engine going in barely a month before 
the event and classes starting right after the event, I may not make it.

However, the atmosphere I've seen at shows like this is something I'd like 
to replicate for our possible pre-KP Bus show in April.  If anyone's ever 
attended SV2's Familienfest, it's the same club putting it on, so I'd 
expect a similar atmosphere to that (but Buses only).  :)
