&gt;&lt;&lt; What are the short- and long-term consequences of overheating? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
I want to add that overheating really stresses the case. My worries are more 
about case life then internal parts so I have done some research. Eric and 
Barb are correct about valve stretch and bearing problems, but the 
additional downside to overheating the vw engine is reduced case life. The 
magnesium/alumimum alloy is soft to begin with and becomes brittle with high 
heat. Its not so much a worry about a crack but more that the areas holding 
the bearings start to break down and wear.
