Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to open pop outs

Look at the surface they seal against. Is it rough? Try 
smoothing it with some wax or rubbing compound. Might 
help to rub the paint with some candle wax or parafin. 
Talcum powder will lubricate the rubber without making a 
mess.

&gt; &gt; So what was decided as working the best.  I recently replaced the top door
&gt; &gt; seal on my '67 Deluxe, and now the doors are really hard to open.  I've
&gt; &gt; tried White Lithium Grease, WD-40, 3-in-1 All Purpose Grease, Vaseline, and
&gt; &gt; Silicone Spray.  None lasted longer than an hour.  Any ideas???
