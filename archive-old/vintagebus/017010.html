Hey all,

Hope everyone had a good weekend.  How difficult is it to change a tranny 
boot with the engine still in (66 bignut)?  Also how much have people seen 
side steps going for.  Sorry for that question, I'm sure I'll get heckled, I 
just haven't been to a swap meet or ever seen one for sale but have one!  
I've heard they've never been supplied by the aftermarket...only a dealer 
option back in the day.   I'd like to keep it but no someone who's bus 
deserves it more...and the cash would help me get my beater 
going...hopefully in the next 3 weeks for High Country, me and sprouts first 
event.  I'm hoping a tranny boot and MC will do the trick!


Thanks,

Eric
66 deluxe
