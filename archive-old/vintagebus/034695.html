Subject: Re: [VB] Westy birch and bus roof racks
To: Turkisbus_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The roof does have two pieces.  There is a metal molding that covers the 
joint on our '67 Westy.  We had the whole thing apart last summer to find all 
of the mouse houses - you wouldn't believe where they set up housekeeping.  
We gutted the bus and put it back together.  Some of the birch is damaged so 
we are happy to hear there are replacements now available.  However it may be 
awhile before we feel like getting into that again!  We didn't damage it - 
the mice did.

I want to thank everyone who wrote with suggestions about our daughter and 
her friend who are moving to Seattle.  Kate has decided to sell here '93 Fox 
before she leaves.  It helped hearing from people who have made the trip - 
who have shipped cars - and who know what might be available out there in her 
price range.  VW people are the best!
