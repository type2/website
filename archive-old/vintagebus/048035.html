&lt;&lt; behind the flywheel nut.  Is this 'o' ring a regular part and easily
 available from the usual outlets ? &gt;&gt;
Hi Lee,
Since this O-ring is of 40HP- 1500cc engines mostly they are getting harder 
to find.  So if you find some you might want to pick up some extras.  Before 
taking out the engine check your endplay and if it is too much you should 
invest in quite a few differant thicknesses unless you are in walking range 
of your VW FLAPS escpecially if what you are running is a 40HP engine.
