&lt;&lt; What is the best method of repainting the VW enblem onto the hubcaps ( 
this 
 is a commercial vehicle with painted hubcaps- I matched the color of the 
 hubcaps to the interior grey/primer and I now want to paint-in the VW emblem 
 on the hubcap using L257 to match the front emblem and the bumpers).
 Do I try to free-hand it or mask it off and spray it?

freehand.  Just like the cross line in the emblem on the two tone buses.  
Dont worry too much, you see original ones that aren't perfect.
