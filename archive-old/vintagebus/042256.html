&gt; hear it's good stuff.Ya just squeeze it into your tire

&gt; guess you might have to keep an eye on your tires for
&gt; nails and such and remove them to avoid more damage.

I've had excellent luck with Slime in motorcycle tubed tires.  I use it
both on the street and off road.  I've only had one flat with the stuff (a
nail absolutely shredded the inner aspect of the inner tube, nothing would
have sealed it!) installed and I've pulled lots of nasty stuff out of the
tires. If the vehicle stays in one place for several weeks, a sealed hole
might dry out and let the air escape.  On the dirt bikes I just rolled the
tire over a couple of times and it resealed fine.  I'm a bit fussier on
the street, so whenever I discoved a puncturing object I would replace the
tube and slime.

I've not tried Slime in a car tire or in a tubeless tire, but I'd expect
that it would work the same.  The caution I stated earlier about sealants
attacking existing patches does apply to Slime.  I probably wouldn't put
it in my bus tires, but it would be good if I was planning extended
off-road adventures.
