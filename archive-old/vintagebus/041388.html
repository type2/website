&gt; choke adjustment as you mentioned. Another problem is that the new 34 PICT 3
&gt; carbs have a different accelerator pump configuration and it hits the
&gt; alternator and requires some tweeking for clearance, if you have an old
&gt; alternator 34 PICT 3 carb, i would suggest switching the accelerator pump
&gt; lever and rod to clear the alternator. 
I have had to get alternator linkage for using the 34pict3 carbs. It goes
inward towards the manifold downtube rather than outward towards the
alternator.  The new 34pict3 comes with generator linkage for the
accelerator pump.  
Using an H30/31 carburetor on a dual port engine has produced a noticeable
drop in hill climbing power for me.  I switched back to a 34pict3 and felt
better going up hill with the pedal on the floor.  This was on a bug, but
I climbed a big hill every day with it at freeway speeds.  The 30/31 carbs
don't flow as much as a 34pict3.  If running dual port heads use a
34pict3.  If running single ports use 30/31 in general.  In Ronnie's case
run 34pict3 with single ports.  I like the sound of that set up. (big
intake single ports) 
There is a guy with that set up here that says it is great in his bay
bus.  He climbs that big hill every day and puts it to the test.
I've never had much trouble with the 34pict3 except the flat spot with 009
which is more noticeable in the winter.
