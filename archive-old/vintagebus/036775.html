hours or more it all depends on what you see or find on the way, if
your following me in the swap panel, about 3 hrs. unless you hit a
headwind, in my double door 4 hours,
if you come with the barndoor boys (everette, earl, shawn etc. ) it
could take up to 6 hours, if you follow rustybus richard or greg it
took them 24 hours to get here, so whatever way you travel it WILL be
fun.

Anyone in the Phoenix area leaving Friday for BBB?  Early to mid
morningish maybe?  Does anyone know how long it takes to get there for
that matter?  I'm guessing about 4 hours, maybe a lil less with the
2016, but we dont mind slow.  

If anyone is planning on leaving Friday we'd love to tag along.

Also, we recently picked up a nice early Sundial tent and it came with
the long metal piece that's supposed to attach to the roof via about 20
screws and the back of the roof panel slides into the groove in this
piece of metal. Any suggestions as to what type of screws we should use
and should any sort of sealer be used too?  Silicone or something?  We
want to attach that part to the bus after we get there.....VW Howard's
gonna help us......right? and I need to pick up all the necessary
supplies beforehand 

Thanks
