&gt;There is a wierd noise in the back, though, noticable when I take it out of

it
&gt;not be there.    It does not make a difference if I step on the brake or
not.
&gt;The fulcrum plates had been changed, to have less play, and I wonder if
that

&gt;Ps if anyone has ideas on that rear thunky noise please say so.

Sure it isn't the throwout bearing? Otherwise, when I changed out the center
in the singlecab for a 3:88 Rancho, I got a thunky noise from the right
axle. With the bus up on jackstands I ran through the gears and when I hit
third it started jumping around and clunking. Put it on the ground and it
didn't do it at all. Figured it for the new fulcrum plates. I had set out
for .006 lash as in the Bentley, but got .004 on the right side which was
supposedly acceptable. After 100 miles I put it back on the stands prior to
dumping the oil, and it did not do it anymore. Probably took a minute of
driving to work the oil in good. Van Bondo and myself changed out his tranny
for a 3:88 Rancho here a week or so ago, and on the advice of AZ. Transaxle
went for .008 lash on the fulcrum plates. Got .006 on one side and .008 on
the other. No clunkies at all to my knowledge. Seems to like a little lash
to let the oil in. To tight and it'll bind when the axles aren't dead flat.
So, if your rear is high or low and the axle tubes are at an angle, it's
probably the fulcrum stuff getting to know each other. If it hasn't gone
away after a short bit, you better tear in there again.
