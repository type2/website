I was the driver of Thom's 'other' bus, the '55 Camp Box Westy.
Three and a half hours behind the wheel of a bus.  It's been a
long time since I've driven a bus that far.  I miss having a
bus of my own.  I mean one that runs.  I've had a couple in
the recent past but, not one that drove nicely.

Thom did a great job on that bus, it tracked nicely, no wandering,
VERY tight brakes, crisp handling, it was good to behind the wheel.
Pedal to the metal the whole way.  I even HAD to pass a few people,
including a Merc*des, on an uphill, cool.

I took my 12 year old son as co-pilot and we had a great time 
looking for stuff.  Found some shirts, some non-VW Hot Wheel toys,
just hung around.  

Met a few listees, but didn't meet all that were there.
Saw a smooth gate singlecab with a HUGE center-above-the-cab light
that needed serious left rear metal work.  Love the smooth gate
trucks.  I'd love to rescue that truck from the current owner.

We didn't get the camper into the show, but my son gives it the
thumbs up.  He slept the whole way home in the back.

Somebody find Thom the correct latches for the hatch, I had to
reach back and grab the bungee holding it down at the same time
as fighting the cross winds, yee-ha!
