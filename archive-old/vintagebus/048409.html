the exception of the right tail light.  I hooked up a jumper from the right 
tailight (thats working fine) to the right...no light. If the bulb is fine 
and the jumper is properly attached to the right does this mean my  right 
repro tailight bucket is jank and has a short or something.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Eric,
You mention jumpering the right tail light to the right tailight that was 
working....  We are guessing you mean your left or right tailight is not 
working and you have tried jumpering to the nonworking one to get both 
working.  If one tailight is not working and has voltage going to it through 
the wires to it then you have a bad ground most likely.  ALL pre-1970ish bus 
tail lights need ground wires attached to them and run to the battery ground 
strap for proper functioning.  Even Vw finally figured this out and about 
1970 started to include a ground tab and wiring for the tailights!   Eric&amp;Barb
