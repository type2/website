Subject: What's In Your Garage?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In my garage are  2 1500 H series rebuildable engine cases,  3 or 4 1600 AJ &amp; 
AK rebuildable bug cases, a mexican and AE 1600 bus case,  a 73 super beetle 
trans, a 69 bus trans, an 80 vanagon trans, a 66 big nut tranny that needs 
rebuilding, an assortment of  fan housings, engine tin, 28 thru 34 pict 
carbs, a 66 steering box with a bit of play, a 73 front bus beam, a pair of 
vanagon sliders, a 73-79 access panel, and about 30 milk crates full of 
engine guts. In fact, I'm holding a garage sale, so contact me if you're 
interested in any of the items mentioned above. I am looking to make some 
room to work, and I''m selling the stuff reasonable or would be happy to swap 
for fuel injection parts, particularly but not limited to 75-77 buses.
