Wait didn't he just get that bus? And wasn't he losing sleep cause it wasn't 
at his shop when it was supposed to be. It is sad to see someone give up hope 
on a project, but to go ahead and try to sell it only after owning it a 
couple of days is incredible. Ronnies bus was told to of cost him 1,500.00, 
and transport cost prolly no more that a 1,000.00, so where does that extra 
5,000.00 of bus come from. It looks like it would be a 1500.00 project, not a 
7500.00 project. Might as well put it on ebay? This is what I dont 
understand, is that bus that valuable, looks like the BD that got cut up in 
PA..
