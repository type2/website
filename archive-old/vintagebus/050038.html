Subject: NOS Parts - Barndoor cargo doors?

As long as TRhom is talking about NOS stuff--

I've got a couple of odd cargo doors.  I bought them from a VW parts
distributor some years ago in Connecticut.  The guy must be out of business
by now.

Anyway, they are different than the doors I had on my '62 23 window, and
they are different than the doors on my '65 standard and '67 kombi.  They
were different in a way that made them look older.  You know - simpler,
more primitive.  They are probably from some kind of split bus which was
being produced in Brazil while the baywindows were still being built in
Germany.  They may be bardoor doors, or they may be something unique to the
Brazilian buses.  Does anyone know what they might be?  If you want to send
me pix of the insides of barndoor cargo doors, preferably with the inside
panels removed, I can ID these things.  They REALLY ARE NOS.  Never been
installed, still in red oxide factory primer (a tip off that they are NOT
german).
