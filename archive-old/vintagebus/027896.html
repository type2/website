&lt;&lt; Why is everyone seem to be so anti-Kustom. &gt;&gt;


I can only speak for my self, and I have seen people on the list like custom 
VWs.  But I think they tend to be ugly.    And hacks.   Even a hack done with 
quality workmanship is a hack.  Makes me think they have good skills, poor 
taste.   A waste of effort.   If it is a practical mod, it can make sense.  
It takes a rare individual to drive it in style.  But most of the things 
people do are pretty bad, and painted in messed up colours.  Like neon green/ 
hot pink lowered buses.   Not just a bad hair day.   You need an operation to 
fix that.
