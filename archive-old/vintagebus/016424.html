Impact is the way to go...

&gt; the plastic plugs in the door jambs- about 1 in  dia, remove those- there are 
&gt; two big screws per hinge or 4/door.    yes they can be a bear.  dont tweak 
&gt; the screw or you get to drill them out :(

Also be careful of beating too hard, and breaking the retaining plate loose in
the back.

On the '54, someone had already tried, and failed to remove the screws.
They had even used a torch, much to the detriment of the paint...  I
had to drill and tap them.  I was &quot;on&quot; that day, and got all of them
perfectly drilled, so I only had to chase the threads to clean them up.
