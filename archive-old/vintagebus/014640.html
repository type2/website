&lt;&lt; &gt;I believe that one of the conversions available for Type 2's was a van 
that
 &gt;could be expanded(?) to show movies or at least public
 &gt;information/instruction films.
 
 &gt;I have looked through my various books and never been able to find out
 &gt;details of this conversion apart from the fact that it existed. Does anyone
 &gt;have any pictures of such a van on-line ? or better still a drawing ? or is
 &gt;able to tell me of a book with these in ?
 
 &gt;At the moment the most I am likely to do is make a model of one, bit who
 &gt;knows perhaps someone might consider building the real thing. How about
 that
 &gt;for an unusual project !

Well, who else would have one, except good ol Charlie Hammil, highroof 
version.
