After using a spectrometer, a sphygmometer, a rectal thermometer and a
couple shots of jack daniels, I came to the conclusion that Krylon 
&quot;Battleship Gray&quot; works fine for me.  It has a bit of a gloss to it, 
that one could either kill with a mist of primer, or simply let
Father Time and Mother Nature work on it for a couple months.  I did the front
and rear wheel arches and front underbelly with this; never got around to
doing the belly pans.

&gt; t*yota 'Taupe' if my memory serves me correctly...  if this is true, I can
&gt; just see the VW committee on 'undercarriage color' deciding on the *correct*
&gt; hue of primer to use :-O
