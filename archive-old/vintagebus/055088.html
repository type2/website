Subject: Re: [VB] Need AJ case (concluded)

&gt;Am I wrong?

I basically agree....though I'd throw in that there is a lot of day 
to day maintenance and repairs. Stuff just always seems to be coming 
up. I drive my '59 Kombi at least 50 miles a day...most of it on the 
highway. I tore down and overhauled the engine myself. I spent less 
on that than I did for a set of tires on my '88 Suburban. If I spent 
the kind of money it takes to maintain a &quot;newer&quot; used car...or even 
to make payments on a new car.... on my bus, it'd be show quality. 
But I'm cheap and don't have tons of extra time, so I complain about 
having to do anything. I'm spoiled 'cause my first VW, a '74 super 
beetle, required almost no work. All I did was dump oil in it and 
drive it 75 miles a day at 85MPH in the Texas heat. Other than losing 
the altenator, it never let me down. Did that for about 2 or 3 years. 
So it's all relative I guess. Main complaint from me is the time. I'd 
rather be working on another VW then spending all the time keeping up 
with my daily driver. But, you can't always get what you want!

p.s. That engine I mentioned that I overhauled for my bus is based on 
a '75 fuel injected AJ case.._dot_came with the bus. I've been told the 
same thing your mechanic told you. Guess I got lucky with that one!
