Quick question for the list...
When I was working on my bus a couple months ago I replaced the tubing in the
engine compartment, black paper/accordion like, i think it went intot he
heater boxes(sorry i forget?) 
Anyway i noticed a piece of metal tubing in the middle, where the tubing
passed through the engine tin to outside or below the engine compartment. I,
being the rocket scientist that i am, didn't put those metal pieces back(I
left them in boston). I now realize that those metal sections prevent the
tubing from getting cut from the engine tin. Does anyone have some dimensions
of that part? I am currently taking a milling class, and thought it might be a
pretty easy part to make for a beginner. 

thanks
