Hi all
I was just reading a HOT VW's may 99 article  about Sal Bernadine..
it reads...about guys buying a new car from the dealer and actuallt
getting the dealer to switch interiors! So ... wouldn't that make
people argue over who had the correct parts,,,
just thought this would add a perspective to the mix!
Hope it helps!

Enjoy your bus for
&gt;what it is and back up your opinions (and unless you bought the bus
new
&gt;and no one else has ever touched your bus it IS only an opinion)
with
&gt;whatever facts you have to back up your opinion without resorting to
&gt;insults.  (wow, was that a long sentence or what?)
&gt;( &lt;snip&gt; ...and alot more good stuff)
