So Woody, when are we going to see some pix?!? Anybody who pmailed you and
flamed you isn't worthy of a response. I bet if they saw you and the buses
in person they wouldn't say a thing to your face.

Personally I'd much rather see a bus painted up that way than to see one
slammed, primered, BRMs, fake safari's, and a sub woofer the size of a
Great Dane. At least the &quot;hippy&quot; paint scheme has a creative, artistic
element to it. Also, you can repaint a bus, but it's sure hard to fix all
of the road damage that lowering can do when it's not done corect (which I
would assume is most of the time).

Of course if I had my choice I, like you Woody, would much rather look at a
nice vintage, stock restoration.

Well, screw the losers Woody! If they're so up in arms about it, let them
send you the money to do a repaint! :)

Scott
