I have a 1641 in my '67 Deluxe.  I could use a little more oomph getting up
the CO mountains, so I've done some investigation into the possibilities.
(There's nothing like tooling along in 2nd gear on I-70 while the Lexii
blast by at 75+ MPH!  Fortunately, the semis aren't going any faster, so
I've got some big company in the climbing lane.)

The advice I've gotten, from two experienced (pro) builders, is that if
you're going bigger, go all the way to 1914 (or is it 1915?).  (And go for a
good CW crank &amp; good balancing, while you're at it.) Apparently the 1914
P&amp;Cs are more robust than those for 1776.  However, both builders
recommended staying with the 34 PICT on DP that I have now.  (BTW, neither
had anything but contempt for the 1776, which was my first thought, too.)

What you really want is more torque (esp. low-end).  According to these
guys, most people who think they want more horsepower really want more
torque.  The 1914 with stock DP components is supposed to be a cheap (w/good
gas mileage), powerful, reliable combination for the bus.

I've seen opinions online saying that the 34 PICT will run out of gas at
high revs with such a big displacement, resulting in potentially bad
leaning-out.  But these guys dismissed that possibility as very unlikely in
sane bus use.  The overall combination would probably be more driveable than
my current 1641 with the &quot;mild&quot; (110 clone) cam, 34PICT, DP, 009 and
extactor:  currently there just isn't enough flow to make optimal use of the
more open intake and exhaust.  Especially in the thin Colorado air I live
in.

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I am about to embark on having an engine built for my panel.  I'd like to
&gt; query you all on what size(s) everyone has had good luck with.
&gt;
&gt; First some background.:
&gt;
&gt; 1963' Panel, lowered with a beetle tranny, and drop spindles.(Please no
&gt; grips on this one)
&gt; I currently have a 1600 SP
&gt; I have just started the wheels turning to have a 1776cc built from
scratch.
&gt; Carburation will be a Progressive.
&gt;
&gt; This engine will have a balanced crank, and mild cam., Alternator(from a
&gt; previous engine), and .044 heads.
&gt;
&gt; The builder pointed me twards a 1641, and to keep my stock carburation,
but
&gt; I am building a motor, because I want some power.  The price for the 1641,
&gt; Would be only a hair less to build, and I figure if I am going through
this
&gt; trouble, why stop with a smaller motor.
&gt;
&gt; This engine will definitly be a driver, that I want to get many miles
from.
&gt; I had an 1835, in my last bus, but that engine was a headache.
Overheated,
&gt; due to too high of compression, and thin cylinders. Then a cracked case,
to
&gt; keep me diligent with the oil.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone who has had good luck with a similar setup?  Bad luck?  I think the
&gt; 1776cc will be a good descision, if it is built correctly, and I have
&gt; confidence in the builders.
&gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate any feedback.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt;
