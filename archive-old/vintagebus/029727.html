&gt;I have a question for everyone.  Last week I had my bus on ebay that sucessfully
reached the reserve and the high bidder said that I misrepresented my ad
my question for everyone is this.  After reading the ad  would you assume
that the bus is running?

&gt;
It's hard for a Bus to run with &quot;1600DP motor complete not installed condition
unknown&quot;.  :)

I always assume &quot;condition unknown&quot; means it is blown or frozen, any other
condition is a nice surprise.

Jeez, how can anyone complain about a bullet-nose 15-window for $2k?!?
