&gt;My neighbor wants me to buy his 66 panel, but the only problem is that he
is
&gt;having trouble pulling the engine to fix the clutch. Seems he has the bolts
&gt;unbolted, but can not find where to hook the &quot;hook&quot; on the cherry picker.
On
&gt;the manifold? Or would this rip out the studs on the heads? Asking for a
&gt;friend.

Cherry picker? Leave the cherry picker over in the corner by the
anti-freeze. If there's cherries on there the clutch is the least of his
worries. Buy the John Muir book How to Repair Your Volkswagen for Compleat
Idiots. Read the procedures. Buy his bus right quick before he rips all the
dang cherries off. Remove rear apron. Disconnect battery + cable (and ground
cable if bolted to generator stand as is sometimes the case),  fuel line
(plugging it is a darn good idea), coil hot lead, generator wires (I told
you to disconnect that durn battery hot lead), and accelerator cable.
FINALLY, remove the four bolts holding the engine to the tranny. And have
him put those two great big bolts back in there, they hold the tranny in and
that's a different procedure. Use a floor jack under the oil drain plate.
Neither lift on the motor or set it too low. Rolls right out. Getting it
back in is another story, takes a spud gun, a pair of nail clippers, a five
dollar bill.
