I made an entire interior out of hardboard material.  It's basically like a 
cardboard/wood.  Would have worked great for making my interior.  
Unfortunatley, after cutting all the pieces from the old patterns and 
fitting them in my bus perfectly, I got online and tried to find some prices 
on vinyl.  Turns out, it was almost cheaper to buy an entire interior set 
from RMM than to finish the panels I spent a week on.
Anyway, if anyone is interested it these pieces, write me up.  They're just 
sitting in my garage right now.
