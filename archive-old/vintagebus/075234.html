Subject: RECAP:  2 of 2

2 of 2 was so darn big that it got bounced by the server .. Not really
important ..  just goes on and on and on ... the entire
story I think .. from almost day one.  Trying to get it straight for when I go
to court.  It has probably all .. or most .. has been said before.

But if you are interested .. it is here .. the whole UGLY story.
