&gt; do i need to have the inside of the drums resurfaced?
&gt; they're a little pitted and rusty, but still about 50% shiny surface...

Hi Ventwing,
We really prefer to not resurface drums unless absolutely needed because VW 
drums just do not have alot of material to them to be removed unlike vintage 
USA automotive brake drums!!!  Plus since nowadays it is hard to find good drums 
and aftermarket ones can be a nightmare...  You might want to just install 
the drums and drive slowly around the block a couple of times and see if that 
loosens up the drum by wearing the brake shoes down a bit.  VW used to sell 
brake shoes in a standard size and oversize linings.  Todays replacement shoes are 
sometimes much thicker then even the original oversized VW shoes.
  If that works make sure to adjust the the brake stars again and at least 
twice more this month if you drive it daily!!
