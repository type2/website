&gt; Well with Travelocity_dot_com, I was able to make it from Omaha to Phoenix with
&gt; 3 to 4 layovers.  Doesn't really bother me much to layover - I keep myself
&gt; occupied by reading dub mags and playing the Gameboy.  But even then, these
&gt; tickets are around $250.
&gt;
&gt; For this price I would be able to see the likes of Memphis, Denver,
&gt; Minneapolis, Fort Worth, St. Louis, and Salt Lake City.
