Subject: Re: [VB] high mileage engines

hi ronnie.  all i drive is air-cooled vws.  i drive approximately 200 miles a week.  however, in a year that's only 10,400 miles and then that gets broken up (unevenly) by which vw i happen to be driving.  (i color coordinate my vw with my outfits!)  these miles are not including shows.

all my vws still have their original-to-when-we-started-going-around-together engines.  at a guess, i'd say that the engines all have about 50,000 on them and they are still providing good service.  this is after between four and six years of service.  these engines are all low-performance 1600 single ports with stockish carbs.

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://www.stanford_dot_edu/%7Erahaha/pig.html
