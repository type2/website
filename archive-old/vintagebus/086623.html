Subject: Engine full of gas it was the fuel pump.

The fine Brosol 20 dollar fuel pump failed within the first month.  Gas 
flowed right through into the engine and out the drain plug when hooked up with no 
carb in place, no engine running, just the fuel lines hooked onto the pump.  
Correct length rod, etc. etc.  BAP gave me a new one but I am not sure I want 
it......   NYUK NYUK NYUK

Anybody getting the old German ones anymore????
