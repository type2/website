&gt; Thanks to everyone who replied to our request for info and help..we used
&gt; &quot;varsol cleaner&quot; along with brushes and putty scrapper and a lot of &quot;elbow
&gt; grease&quot; (grin).
&gt; But it finally did come clean enough so that we could get to the changing
of
&gt; the brake parts.
&gt;
&gt; BTW..I am looking for the lower aluminum molding ...drivers side for a 66
&gt; Deluxe in good useable condition, ours has been done away with by PO at
some
&gt; point.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again
&gt; &quot;sunbuggy&quot;
&gt;
&gt;   Ira
