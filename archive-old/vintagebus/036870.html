Subject: Replacement Steering Wheels
Message-ID: &lt;881b542f.245b4252_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Everyone,
I am wanting to replace my worn/badly worn off white steering wheel in my 67
Westy. Much of the rest of the bus has been fixed up/restored. Since the
wheel is in my hands the entire time that I drive, the irritation is
persistent. And perhaps worth a significant investment. I have a restored one
listed at BFY (bfyobsoleteparts_dot_com) for $225 and note that Kochs doesn't
list a price, just send yours and they will quote. Does anyone have
experience with either or another good vendor. I think I will be too critical
of the job if I try to do it myself.
TIA
