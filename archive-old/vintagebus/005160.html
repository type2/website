Subject: Panel  Van Question

Ok, since I started a lynch mob on the lowering a bus subject, I'm going to
try and ask something that hopefully won't cause such a stir :)

I have a '64 double door panel bus (walkthrough). I'm in the process of
collecting parts for it because I want to get it driving for spring.  My
question is this.  I want to replace all of the metal brake lines. But since
my panel has what seems to be a full undercarriage skid plate (it's factory,
I'm guessing for bracing of the double doors on the bus, kinda like the
'vert rails on a bug or Ghia) what's the best way of doing this? It doesn't
seem to bolt on, it looks to be spot welded in place.  Has anyone ever done
this before?? I ALWAYS, replace the complete braking system when I restore a
VW. Being able to go is nice, but being able to STOP is the most important
thing to me.

Pictures of my bus can be seen at:

Thanks
