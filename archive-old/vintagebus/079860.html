&gt; Hi I went ahead with the type 4 oil cooler conversion. What with this and
&gt; cleaning out the fan housing and the wider fan I found I could cruise at 65 all

&gt;  flicker.

Keep in mind that oil temperature is only half of the story.  You also
need to watch CHT as well, as this is what causes pulled studs and other
nasty problems.
