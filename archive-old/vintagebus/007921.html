Oh i dont blame you nor do i disagree. I've pulled mine for an exchange so
many times, that the manager said &quot; one more time, and were gonna have to
give you back your money. there CANT be something wrong with the starter
THAT many times&quot;....Guess hes got alot of faith in his product. Gimme Bosch
over Duralast any day, but the real pupose of this convo is Bosch aint gonna
be makin them noh moh (according to whoever posted that) so Duralast is plan
B. Gotta get lucky and get a good one that wasn't rebuilt on a friday...

&gt;I have a well-earned distrust of Chief/Kragen/AutoZone &quot;rebuilt&quot;
&gt;parts such as generators and starters.  Sure, they offer a lifetime
&gt;warranty, but how many times do you really want to pull that muther
&gt;out?  The last time I bought a Kragen generator, I got the thing
&gt;home, took one look at it, and took it right back.  The commutator
&gt;was in such crappy condition, and had been oversprayed black, that
&gt;I knew this thing wasn't going to last.  I took it right back and
&gt;paid - gladly - twice as much for a real Bosch unit from the VWFLAPS.
