BTW, if you go to Poor Richard's web page, the shirt graphics have a certain
&quot;drawn with magic marker&quot; quality that is not fair to the artwork. This is
probably due to scanning and compression for the web. Richard's stuff is
very clean in real life.

The Aircooled Search &amp; Rescue shirts in particular are legendary, the
artwork is absolutely immaculate and I believe they've been out of
production for at least two years. He won't sub-license these (believe me I
have tried =^ ) so if you don't get one when he feels like making them, then
you ain't getting one at all. At $15 you're crazy if you don't IMO.

No, we are not getting a cut in any way, I just know well-done volk art when
I see it and RP is an artist who deserves to succeed. =^ )

&gt; 
&gt; Hi. I just wanted to re-post the t-shirt order information, as well as a
&gt; reminder that the deadline for me RECEIVING your orders is fast approaching. I
&gt; must have your orders in hand by the first week of April, so I can make the
&gt; correct order from the printer. Thanks to those that have already sent orders.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a while since I did a run of t-shirts, but folks have been
&gt; asking about them, and so I'm doing another run along with the EVERYBUS shirts
&gt; for this year. Pictures are on my t-shirt page, at:
&gt; http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/tshirts.html
&gt; 
&gt; I am doing the &quot;All new Netvergnu:gen shirts&quot;, the official list t-shirt of
&gt; the
&gt; Vintagebus and Type2 lists, and Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts, as
&gt; seen
&gt; toward the bottom of the page. Now
&gt; you can have something stylish to wear to bus events or to the office, to show
&gt; others your true VW-coolness, and also easily recognize other listmembers at
&gt; events.
&gt; These have been officially sanctioned by list and domain masters Ken Hooper,
&gt; Thom Fitzpatrick, and Steve Dolan.
&gt; Shirts will again be $15.00, and are available by pre-order in sizes of kids'
&gt; large through adult XL. For an extra $5, XXL or XXXL are available. Long
&gt; sleeve
&gt; shirts are also available for an extra $5. I will try to print up a few extras
&gt; to sell later on, but please do us both a favor and pre-order if possible. The
&gt; deadline to pre-order is April 1, which means I must have your order in my
&gt; hand
&gt; by then, as that is when I will be placing the final order. If you are going
&gt; to
&gt; EVERYBUS, you can pick them up there. Otherwise, shipping is $5.00 per shirt,
&gt; which will be shipped out Priority Mail.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I need from you-
&gt; 
&gt; -check or money order for your order $15.00 per shirt
&gt; +$ 5.00 per each XXL or XXXL
&gt; +$ 5.00 per each Long Sleeve
&gt; +$ 5.00 each for shipping/handling
&gt; 
&gt; -index card with your name, mailing address, e-mail, and SIZE,QUANTITY, and
&gt; DESIGN of shirts ordered.
&gt; 
&gt; Send to:
&gt; Poor Richard Palmer
&gt; 121-C Park Ave.
&gt; Raleigh, NC, 27605-1832
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again, and hope to see you at EVERYBUS!
