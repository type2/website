Jon, I tend to agree with whoever it was who suspected
the wire to #2.  Do you routinely check resistance
from the terminal inside the dist to the plug end when
tuning cars?  We used to do that all the time when I
was a professional (ha, ha) mechanic, and sold lots of
plug wires.

Good luck,

JP

PS  When I was working at Small Car People years ago,
one fellow brought in a non-running vehicle he had
tuned up himself, and my boss wrote &quot;make run&quot; on the
work order, which he always thought would result in
big bucks.  I pulled the distributor cap, shined up
the contacts inside, and it started right up.
