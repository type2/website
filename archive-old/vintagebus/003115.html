Your mcodes would be great to see !!
You should have a mcode #SO25 for the side loading single cab with ramp and
possibly a SO31 for being shipped in primer. Also I would imagine the side
loading conversion would
have been done in good old Germany and probably by Westfalia ? No ?
How about  seeing the mcodes Ronnie ?!!?

Der Busbesitzer Gruppe's home page, a Neato chapter
64 kombi   slow (big nut)
61 panel    slower (small nut)
60 westy    slowest (no nut)

&gt; conclusion is/was that this bus was shipped to the U.S. unpainted (kind of
&gt; like a Binz) than shipped to the conversion people to be made into the
side
&gt; loader! I could be wrong, I have been before, but this is just the
&gt; observation I made.
&gt; Conclusion, has anybody else ever heard of or seen a bus shipped to the
U.S.
&gt; this way?? I would like to pull out the original headliner pieces but I
&gt; don't want to take a chace breaking them, they are perfect originals.
