Subject: Bigger rubber bump-stops on axels...how do they mount?

I have both rubber bumpers that sit on the axels, but one came off in my
hand.

Was there a shaft or something that was in the center of the dish that
the bumper sat one?

If there was, said shaft is no more.

Any ideas on how to fix that?

Its on a '66 bus.

Thanks,
...Markus
