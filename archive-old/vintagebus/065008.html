Subject: Radio Wiring

 I have a Sapphire II am/fm radio that I want to install in a '65 bus.
The radio has several wires that I need some help to identify: 
 
1)One brown wire that is double stranded comes from the right side of
the radio. 
2)On the left side of the radio is three single wires, two of them
are black and one is brown.
Can anybody help me identify what is what?
