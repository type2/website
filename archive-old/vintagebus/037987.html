Hi:
Thanks for all your input.  I went to sears and walmart today.  Walmart 
doesn't have the jack combo anymore and sears doesn't have torque wrench in 
stock (man, it's really expensive!$99.99)8^(.  Maybe I'll just order the jack 
from Harbor freight and use the weight method to tighten the axle nut.
Thanks again,
Michael
