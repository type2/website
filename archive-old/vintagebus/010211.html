i went by a sign supply place today to get some corrugated plastic/vinyl
sheets, if your not familar with them, they are just like cardboard but they
are plastic, comes in many colors, great for kickpanels, and only $10 a
4'x8' sheet, anyway the plan was to redo the door panels too, i showed the
lady what i was making and the old door panel and she said 'oh thats the
stuff they pack our shipments in', and she gave me 4 4'x8' sheets of that
masonite paneling stuff, they throw it out all the time,it is almost
identical to the orignal door panel material, same texture and thickness,
and moor than enought to redo the whole bus, it was cool, you might want to
check out your local sign supply company.
