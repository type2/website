Subject: front tranny mount

hey list,
im pretty sure that my front tranny mount is bad on my '65, due to a =
clunking sound when i let out the clutch.  is there any way to replace =
this without pulling the tranny out?  im also leaking some oil and it =
looks like its coming from between the nosecone and tranny case.  i also =
see some oil up near my shift coupler which i just replaced.  hopefully =
this is all related to the same problem, but i just wanted some opinions =
or advice before i dive into this.  thanks!
