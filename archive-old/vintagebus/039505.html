Went camping last weekend in St. Augustine and ran across the Franklin Mint 
model bus.  Has anyone actually purchased one of these wallet behemoths.  
($135.00)  Just interested to know if anyone has them for sale, maybe $20 or 
$25.  Just asking, reply only to me, I don't want anyone else to get my 
deal.......  Good thing it is Friday, limited technological expertise and 
all I get a day.

Thanks
