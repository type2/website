I picked up an interior of a camper type set up, last august. I thought I was
going to be buying a passenger type vehicle and converting it into a camper.
But as I bought a camper I would like to get rid of this interior. It is all
original. The seats have orginal plaid-type fabric. It includes the sink,
icebox, cabinets, the paneling for the walls, the pullout bed and maybe some
more stuff, I haven't really loked at it for a while. It is in pretty good
shape. Anyone living near boston, want to make me an offer, I am eager to get
it off my hands, and I would rather have a list member get it than have to put
it on ebay or something.

Thanks
-kevin

oh yeah if you have any questions please p-mail me.
