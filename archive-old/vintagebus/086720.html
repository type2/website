Subject: Re: [VB] Suitable engine???

Hi Dave,
If you want longevity and reliabilty, build that engine to a 1500, or  1600.  
Any bigger than that, and you should get an AE or later  case.  The more you 
bore out the areas in the engine case where the  pistons go into you weaken 
the area in front of #3 cylinder.  Due to  this the case can crack and pump oil 
all over the clutch.  So to prevent  this from happening the engine case 
filled/welded in front of #3  cylinder or finding a later brazilian case with this 
area cast thicker.   Even with an AE case much above 1776, you should look 
into an all aluminum  engine case.  Though there have been problems with those!  
See  the archives for more info about that.
