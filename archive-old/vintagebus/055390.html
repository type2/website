Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Headlight Eye Brows

Hey kosmic karma guy,
 I do have them, go park your bus in front of a wall
and fix them lights. Don't make excuses. Eyebrows are
not for H-4's, VW's didnt come with H-4's. And dont
tell me they are to keep the rain off the headlights
either. If you run them, I have no problem with that,
just dont make stuff up.
 Mike

&gt; 
&gt; Mike,
&gt;      My head light adjustment is fine, thank you. 
&gt; Maybe your not up on 
&gt; H-4's, they put out quite a lot more light than the
&gt; sealed beams your 
&gt; running.  I guess we could say, compared to H-4's,
&gt; your a little on the dim 
&gt; side.  Maybe you should consider a set.
&gt;                                                     
&gt;                          
&gt;     Peace,
&gt;                                                     
&gt;
