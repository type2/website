One thing I forgot to post about on my previous step #4 post, is that I'm
having a hell of a time seeing when I weld.  I can have a nice seem all set
up, and then when I'm done tacking it, I didn't do a bit of good because I
proceeded to tack weld out in the middle of nowheresville.  Is there a
product made like a crayon that glows when it receives UV light?  Or should
I get one of those LCD shields?  Anyone else have this problem?  Thanks for
any advice you can lend...
