All this talk of Muir on the Type2 list lately has kept me motivated--that, and the cold, damp weather has kept me inside. 

I sat down this morning and put together a color-coded reproduction of Muir's diagnostic flowchart that came with the engine sounds tape. I also have permission to reproduce this. It's a 124 KB gif image that spans about 3 printed pages. I know I could have used layers and HTML to do this, but I didn't have the time or the tools that would automate the process.

See http://www.volks_dot_net/muir/index.htm

for the sounds and a link to the diagnostic flowchart.

Again, if you're going to link to this location, please do so at: http://www.volks_dot_net/muir/index.htm or http://www.volks_dot_net. Otherwise, people won't see the copyright notices, etc. If you do link to the site from yours, I'd like to know (just out of curiosity).

Thanks! Joe
