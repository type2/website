Subject: The wife made a deal on Safari's

My wife made a deal on a used set of Safari windows. They are complete with
the glass &amp; everything. They're a little rusty, but for $50 they were a
steal!!! Just in budget for the '59 Kombi I'm making into my daily driver.
She's a keeper...the wife that is.
