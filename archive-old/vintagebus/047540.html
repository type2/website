Subject: Elevation Carb Problem????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello good Volks,
This is the first time I've been stumped this year, and here is my story;
I live in Flagstaff AZ. (ABC member #420) at 7100ft elevation and few weeks 
ago drove down to Phoenix 2000ft? to see a show, blew and seized the 
previously great running engine in the Zebrabus (66 Westy) and promptly 
replaced it with a BAP 1600sp rebuild longblock.  It ran great, pretty happy, 
cruised around to break it in and headed up the hill.  Got to 5000ft and it 
started to bog and lack power.  I got out and advanced the timing a few 
degrees, helped a bit but still sluggish.  Got into town an it would barely 
do 20mph REAL sluggish.  Pulled a plug real sooty black and smelling like 
gas.  Turned the idle mixture screw almost off and increased the idle speed 
(air) screw to try and lean it out.  This improved things a bit but it's 
still a dog, no power at all.  
What am I doing wrong???  Could my carb (30/31 Solex) be bad, it looks pretty 
old?  Wrong jets for this altitude?  Could I have hurt my new engine? Ill buy 
a new carb or jets or whatever I just want my bus running strong again...
Big Thanks
Eric
