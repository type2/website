I don't really know, but this weekend at a show here in the Northwest a guy had one complete and all rebuilt in the back of his truck. He even ran it! It was super silky and the cost...only $500. This seemed cheap to me. It was even a bus numbered case. Oh to have some extra cash.

Hope this helps,
