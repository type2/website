What he is looking for is the rust free, straight panel bus for under 1000
dollars. He passed on an almost perfect 60 DD Panel that ended up in Havasu
with cab divider that was purchased for well under 2000 dollars. He also
passed on a 59 panel that just needed a torsion rewelded in that was
included for 300 dollars that also ended up in Havasu. Also passed on my old
62 panel that was straight, O rust and had over 3000 invested in the
drivetrain which I would have removed and sold the bus for a lesser price to
him and he could have bought VWHowards 57 DD for way under a 1000. I have
been looking for over a year for a CHEAP bus for him and still can't seem to
find one that will fit in the budget. I hope he finds what he's looking for
becuse if it's done up like his other LOGOED bus it will be a very nice
looking bus.

ps. I will have a 57 DD here soon for around 2000 if your interested.

&gt;There's that nice '56 on Everett's site that has TV Logo's on the side
of it.  It was up for sale for 5K awhile ago, and now another guy has it
up for 3,900.00 looks like a deal to me.

I have seen this Bus and can comment via pmail to those interested.
