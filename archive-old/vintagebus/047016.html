The fliers are ready for Bulli Brigade 5, the Split window bus show in Tampa
Florida. If you would like to recive a mailing, and you dont think your on the
mailing list, please p-mail me. This show is a laid back event with a few
trophies and a free swap to those that enter in a 67 and earlier bus. After
the event we will gather for a group photo and then caravan to the show hotel
and campground for the following days event, The Florida Bug Jam. There are
groups who are planning trips south from NC and GA, as well as mentions of TN
and MO. Hope to see you there.
