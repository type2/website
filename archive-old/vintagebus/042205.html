Get a gopher trap, open up a fresh tunnel, put the trap in, cover the hole
with a pie pan upside down with a brick on top.

Gophers, for some reason, will want to repair the damage you did and will
get themselves caught in the trap.

I have tried to off the little critters by piping exhaust from my bus into
their tunnel system, but they seem to like it!  :)
