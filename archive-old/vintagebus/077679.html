Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [BSKA] Update on the BBB burned bus

&gt;To add further fuel to the fire (so to speak), I'm of the opinion that a
&gt;fire extinguisher is a very good thing to carry in *any* car.

I was looking for some brass fittings this weekend at the local home 
improvement store for my remote oil filter setup on my Corvair engine. 
Found everything I needed but also found some nice little brass ball valves 
for less than $10.

How about installing one in the fuel line right under the gas tank and 
connecting a generic choke cable allowing the driver to shut off the fuel 
flow in case of fire. A more elaborate version would be to use a power lock 
solenoid to do the same job.

The whole idea being to shut off fuel to the engine where the fire is. 
Further advantage would be theft prevention. With a carb'ed engine, the 
vehicle could be hot wired and driven a short ways before the carb ran out 
of gas (valve closed) and the engine stalled. I'd bet a thief would bail 
rather than try to troubleshoot this vehicle.

Whole project should be under $25 for the valve and the choke cable.

Question: anyone aware of a tool that would allow me to flare the ends of 
the metal line on the bottom of the gas tank so I could add ALL steel fuel 
lines to the fuel system?

In each bus fire story it the source has been the same: rubber lines that 
have rotted, popped off, or the little brass inlet popping off. There is 
alot of damage done thanks to the gravity feed design of the gas tank.
