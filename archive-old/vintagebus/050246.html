Subject: FS:'57 Single Cab in TX...pix up!
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b3aac65508d6_at_[192.168.0.9]&gt;

I got some pictures of the '57 Single-Cab I've got for sale up on the web.
You can get there from a link on my site or go directly to:

BEWARE: lots of pictures resulting in slow loading. I thought it'd be
alright so people can get a good idea of the condition of the truck. Just
go grab a drink (or a smoke, or your wife, or whatever turns you on) while
you let the pages load.

I don't know how much to ask. Email me what you think it's worth. I'd like
to hear from people who even arent' gonna buy so I can get an idea of
value. I'm trying to find out what would be a fair price so I can drop down
a little from that to make it a good deal for someone.

Take it easy!
