&lt;&lt; The one I bought at the FLAPS is crappy and just refuses to hold one of 
the bolts in tightly (after very few miles). &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
You might be able to fix that by center punching around the threaded hole 
while the bolt is in there.  Whichever way you go make sure to not only 
safety wire the bolts, but make sure the safety wires are actually wound in 
such a way as to tighten the bolts and not loosen them!   Eric&amp;Barb
