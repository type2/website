i have been taking a german class this fall, just to help me get a little
closer to my bus. I feel my bus, although it has been in the country longer
than me, is still having trouble witht he language, so i will try to learn a
little german.

anyway i was just talking to my teacher about old vws, and she told me her dad
had an old one(I think 1970). Original paint, it was originally a volunteer
fire truck. great shape, basically no rust(maybe a little) Body straight, some
electrical problems came up, and he didn't drive it in the winter, insurance
real high....so he sold it. 

for 2000 DM, which is under $1000 dollars....is it me or is that cheap? She
said it was in great shape and had a new motor in it...i told her to ask her
dad to find one for me, and i'll be over next summer to pick it up...
