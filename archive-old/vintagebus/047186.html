Message-ID: &lt;dbeb6f0c.247db672_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Ok Last call....The dinner will be held Saturday night at 8pm at the 
Spaghetti Factory off highway 50 at 8pm...Pacific Time. Everyone is welcome! 
Ramva or not...this will be a casual get together of VW lovers. You don't 
have to RSVP with me but you may..It will be a good time good food and just 
good old BS about VW's. Who knows might have a good little pre-bugorama car 
show in the parking lot!! I think we'll call it a night at about 9:30 or 9:45 
because the gates at the track close at 10pm for all of us &quot;cheap bastards 
(me included) who will be camping there. Hope to see everyone there...!!!
