Chris,
&quot;I am poor&quot; != &quot;1835 built right&quot;

This does not add up.  A built up 1835 will be a couple grand easy, very
easy.  If you are poor I would seek other options.  Maybe snatch a 1.7 or
1.8 type 4 for cheap and get the conversion kit to drop into a bus for
$500ish.  Cheap reliable horsepower.

Also to do a proper 1835 you will need to get everything balanced and the
case machined properly... Which most people cannot do at home.  In addition
you will need to get a C/W crank, Berg Equalizer (6.5lb) pulley, lightened
flywheel, a non-stock cam, forged P&amp;Cs, $400 on good heads(SS valves,
polished, mild port, perf springs), a few hundred for the complicated oil
cooler you want to run, and the time to weld up engine tin that fits
properly.   This is a large under taking to get right.  I think Ronnie is
building a hot motor right now and you may want to talk to him to get some
better idea of the scope of work ahead of you.

Sure you can slap one together and have it blow up in a year or two, but
that would be waste of your time and money.

Also I think the external oil cooler is a huge overkill.  See my previous
ramblings.  A clean efficient doghouse motor should not get that hot.  The
ROI on a external fan setup is low compared to the available alternatives.

You may be surprised by the power of a well built 1600.  This would be with
a non-stock torque grind cam, polished DP heads w/ SS valves, extractor
exhaust, dual baby Dells or baby Weber's, C/W crank, doghouse cooler, etc..
You get the picture.  Not a cheap rebuild, but one that you can do easily
and will last a long time.  I would guess a good setup 1600 would bring
65-75 HP, given that a stock DP should be 55-60 HP.   Also with the baby
Weber's you can still run a vacuum dizzy!  


Begin Ramblings:

Last night was the local Peachstate Transporters bus club meeting.  I rode
with my buddy who has a '71 bay westi with a 1600 with 30PICT-3 carb and 009
dizzy.  It ran like crap!  I built the motor for him so I know it is good,
but that stinking 009 was killing him.  I think it makes a huge difference
in drivability to add a vacuum dizzy.  That stock dizzy will make the motor
'feel' like 10 more HP.  Okay the motor is a hack because he did not spring$
for many new parts, but it is still strong...  Not my best work but it runs.
Hey Bob, I did fart in the bus a couple times too ;)  LOL

Also on temps run a VDO gauge and see what you are running before spending
the time on an external cooler.  Here are the general Porsche numbers (356,
914, and 911):
176-210 running cool
220 Normal 
230 Warm
240 Hot
250 Too Hot

These are at the gauge readings per Bruce Anderson, a noted authority in
Porsche circles.  So do not flame at me with head oil temperatures being 25
degrees hotter BS.

One thing that is interesting is that Bruce Anderson recommends dino juice
for pre '74 Porsche engines(pre 2.7L) due to different seal material in the
earlier cars.  He recommends 15W-40 winter and 20W-50 summer in dino juice.
From my experience with crappy VW aftermarket seals I would tend to agree
and stay dino juice on these VW type 1 motors.

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl

were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
