Subject: Re: [VB] Aircon applications for buses

----- Original Message -----

&gt; In a boat magazine a couple days ago I saw an eberspacher advertisement.
they are still around and making heaters.

Yep, here they are:
www.espar_dot_com

They look to be focusing on boats and tractor trailors applications (which
makes sense).

I looked into the cost a little while ago, and the small unit was going for
roughly $900. 7500 BTU's on high. Probably work alright if you didn't live
in really cold climates.

Up here in SLC, you probably want something similar to a BN4 or a Bus SW. My
SW is rated 20,000 BTU's, and when it gets down to 30 degree's, you'll need
it, otherwise it would take way too long to warm up the interior. There's a
whole lot of cold steel, upholstry, and glass to warm up in a bus! Espar
makes one now that kicks out 18,800 BTU's, and is around the same size as
the old gas heaters we're using now. I've heard they cost around $1600.
(ouch!). But the nice thing is, you can get cool accesories for them like a
7 day digital timer, so the heater starts warming up before you leave in the
morning, or before you leave to go home after work, and thermostats so you
aren't playing with a lever or knob to keep the temperature comfortable. Set
it at 75 and forget it. Or hotter or colder, whatever your taste is.

If someone gave me one, I would take it in a heartbeat, but I don't make
enough money to justify the purchase. (especially now that I just installed
one).  I'm still trying to figure out how to hook up an inexpensive timer on
mine so I have a toasty bus in the morning without having to fire it up
beforehand.
