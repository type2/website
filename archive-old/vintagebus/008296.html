&gt; I guess if nobody could afford a house in the USA, we'd pay $20k for a Bus
&gt; too.  Of course, it's getting that way, most people can't afford one
without
&gt; 2 incomes.


&gt;
&gt; There's always somebody out there that'll pay more than you for something,
&gt; the trick is finding that guy when you're selling and keeping him away
when
&gt; you're buying.

&gt; P.S. I always laugh when I see people use &quot;A$$&quot;.  So you're saying you
have
&gt; an expensive ass?  Or maybe cheap, that's only 2 figures...  ;)
&gt;
&gt;I'm a &quot;cheap ass&quot; when I have to pay for something, an &quot;expensive ass&quot; when
I have something to sell. You're right about someone always willing to pay
more, but more to my point is the fact that it seems like everytime I get
interested in something for a hobby, it's right at the time that particular
object takes off in popularity. Pedal cars, Porsches and Harley's come to
mind, and the same thing has happened with buses. I just wish I could get
into things early enough to be able to afford what I want and then let the
prices go nuts.
