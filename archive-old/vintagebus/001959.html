Yeah, I don't know who offered it either, and there are always special
cases.  I'm just saying that spending 2 hours and some nail polish to fix
and old Blaupunkt speaker because someone thinks it sounds better than new
speakers is amusing.  I actually used the nail polish trick to fix a home
speaker (AR401) that's about 15 years old - and it worked exactly as it had
been described.  Awesome!

david f martin rebuked...
&gt;nail polish... I was installing expensive new Blaupunct (sp?) speakers
&gt;on a 98 MexiBeetle, my screwdriver slipped, and I used the procedure to
&gt;fix the speaker. Much cheaper than replacing a $50 speaker...
