Subject: [VB] blowby concern
Message-ID: &lt;0.14b6e21e.2569dc06_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

   I recently rebuilt my 1600 dual port and am now discovering what I think 
is blowby coming from behind the crankshaft pulley.
   I did the 20 min at 2000rpm break-in then ran it, afterward changed the 
oil and checked valves. We then took it on a camping trip of about a 150 mile 
round trip. When I got it home I noticed a fine oil mist all over the engine 
compartment. It does look like it came from behind the pulley. I read through 
the archieve to get some more ideas as to what all could be the cause here. 
  Is it possible that the rings just haven't had time to seat yet or is it 
more likely i didn't stagger the ring gaps properly. This was my first time 
so please be gentle.
