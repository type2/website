My buddy did this to his single cab.He bought it from Radio Shack.He says it
doesn't work as well as a normal antenna .So he installed a antenna booster
from Radio Shack.Then it works well.
        Good Luck,

&gt; Robert,
&gt; I just remembered about some hidden antennas that I had seen.  Generally,
they are a short piece of wire that you stick &quot;somewhere&quot; out of sight and
it is connected to an active amplifier that is tuned for the broadcast bands
