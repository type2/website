&gt; OK,  A guy wants to trade my b*g for his '65 double door panel. I wanted to 
&gt; know if the '65 panle had the big window in back. I know that any other '65 
&gt; would, but I have never noticed any panels having the big window in back. The 
&gt; only thing that the list would probably not approve of is that the bus has a 
&gt; 1776 with dual 40mm webers, and dropped spindles. But to me it is still a 
&gt; bus. I can fix it when I want to.

A 65 panel would have the big window in back unless it is a) fitted with a
special and rare no rear window option or b) a highroof, those had small
hatches until end of splitty production.

As for wether or not the list will &quot;approve&quot; of a modified bus... dont
even think about that.  Its your bus do with it what you will.  This list
was formed with the intention of being for all 67 and older busses,
period.

On this lists predecessor, people put 74+ westy tops on their splits and
told others how to do it.  Some grumbled but it was understood i think
that the lists are for bus owners, not one particular temprament of bus
owner.

Vintage nazi's are a part of the list, but are not the reason for the
list. (thom, oh great vintage nazi, correct me if i am wrong, hehe)

enjoy your panel bus :)

peas,

Steve

p.s. one of my good friends from my bus club has a slammed 67.  Not what
i'd do to my bus, i like to go offroading, but he likes it and it does
look cool.  It has a flame-job even...
