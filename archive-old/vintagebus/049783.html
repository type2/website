&gt;&gt;Kabayo
&gt;&gt;Had enough of being ruled by others?  Want to begin to regain lost

&gt;Since it's Friday, I had a question:
&gt;
&gt;Isn't Kabayo slang for Heroin?

Well, 'kabayo' is Tagalog for 'horse', and I've heard heroine referred to
as horse.

My nickname was given to me by my first Filipina fiancee, whose
pronunciation of 'stallion' sounded like 'Stallone', so she switched to
Kabayo.  I was her first caucasian lover...


 That would appear to undermine your position
&gt;as a proponent of an underdog political party.

How exactly?

[Maybe you know already that the Libertarian Party supports the repeal of
all laws regarding consensual ('victimless') crimes, including drug laws.]


&gt;
&gt;Bus content:
&gt;On the scale of chrome quality, where does original Bus chrome rate?  I'm
&gt;curious what sort of quality is appropriate for a restoration.
&gt;Triple-plating to be sure!


I wouldn't know about this one.
