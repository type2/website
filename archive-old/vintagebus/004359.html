 Quote from Dave Cormack in the March 2000 issue of VW Treands page 10
bottom right.

  They (SVII's) along with national Bus organizations, such as SOTO and OCTO
( read the rest for yourself) .  I guess NEATO is not a national Bus
organization. And I thought OCTO was a CHAPTER OF NEATO !!! Oh well. Maybe
this is why BBB and Jerome never get any press as well as the many great bus
shows each year. We do have a great time though. See all of you I hope at
BBB this weekend. Just my thoughts, No offence to STV's , soto or octo.
