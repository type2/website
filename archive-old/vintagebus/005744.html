Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Kombi 1600cc engine rebuild

            I just started work on my motor and I'm about ready to split the
case. My wife is in our garage every time I'm there, going through Idiot
Book to make sure I'm doing everything &quot;by the book&quot;. It's kind of nice this
way. She doesn't even know yet that we will pick up another bus next
weekend. I know she suspects something but she would never spoil it for me.
Rebuilding this engine kind of feels good already. I hope it will all work
after putting it in the bus since this is the first time I'm doing it. Well,
we usually learn from our mistakes, right??

Good luck with it Rex.

Andre
