&gt; But George, you are not an insulator. You are full of ionic solutions.

A balloon isn't full of ionic solutions.  Inflate a balloon, rub it on
your hair, stick it to the wall electrostatically.

Conduction isn't required to charge an object.  In fact, you don't want
conduction.  In order to get a good charge built up for a really good
'fro, I have to stand on a plastic bucket to prevent charge from leaking
to ground (via 1&quot; sparks from the side of my shoes!)
