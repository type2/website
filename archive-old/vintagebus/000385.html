Hi Craig,
That size of engine will work fine with either sized air cleaner if you plan 
not to drag race your bus, or do RPMs in excess of 4,000 RPM.  Though you 
will have to set up the carb. jets properly whichever way you go.  Right now 
we are running a 1641cc single port engine with an even earlier 40 HP air 
cleaner with no problems.
