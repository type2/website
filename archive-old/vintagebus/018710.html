There's someone (can't recall the name or web site) who set up an operation
to specifically pull buses out of california and aridzona and ship them to the UK.

Geeze, with so many RHD barndoor deluxes in the California now, I should just
part mine out.  Put the roof on the 60 DD...

&gt; What is going to England?  We just brought the three nicest buses that were in 
&gt; England to the US. A 54 RHD deluxe, a 53 swedish cargo door panel, and a 54 
&gt; RHD DD panel.  It seems that as of recently, we have been winning this 
&gt; import/export battle thanks to the value of the dollar.
