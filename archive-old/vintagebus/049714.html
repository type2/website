&gt;I have pretty much already decided that I am not going to replace any of
&gt;the atual gears in the reduction boxes unless the are absolutely
&gt;terrible. They are all straight-cut, and therefore relatively
&gt;bullet-proof, albeit noisy.
&gt;

Usually when there is any bearing wear in the reduction boxes, the oil
carries a lot of metal bits, which then increases the wear rate throughout.
If one bearing has significant wear, they all will.

The bulk of the work even to replace the outer bearings is in dismantling
the rear brakes. Once you've got far enough into the job to expose the
outer bearings, you might as well do it properly and replace the lot.
Bearings are cheap, and you don't want to repeat this job unnecessarily in
a few months. Although the inner bearings are slightly more difficult to
replace than the outers, the whole redux box R&amp;R job is not *that*
difficult, just messy. If you have the correct pullers, the job is quite
straightforward. The only real difficulties are:

1) Top inner bearing can be a bit recalcitrant. Proper puller makes it a
doddle though.
2) Bottom inner bearing cover plate -- if you have metal cover plates, they
can be difficult to remove without destroying them. Use a factory-type
puller, though, and they ease right out. If you have plastic cover plates,
then they just pry out with a screwdriver.

Dismantling the brakes and everything required to get the redux boxes
stripped down is a real pain and very messy. Correct pullers here makes the
differnece between a straightforward job and a lot of cursing and skinned
knuckles. It is also very rewarding to see your redux boxes reassembled and
*clean*. And you shouldn't have to do the job again for another few years.

Redux box overhaul is the one bit of transmission work that you *can* do
yourself. I say go for it.
