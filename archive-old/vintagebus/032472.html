&lt;&lt;The path of least resistance would be to get a set of the brazilian ones,
and a set of the make-up pieces that kelly sells, and have your body guy
fix 'em up.  Your chances of finding really nice 3-piece doglegs are
slender.  Isn't you bus 10/56 or so?  Does it have 3-piece doglegs now?
&gt;&gt;

I rather find original ones, then section in the seam.
Not expecting to find original barndoor ones, just need some clean 56-62 ones.
Yes, its 10-55 and needs barndoor ones.
