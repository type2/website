&gt; I just complelted a brake job on my 66 new shoes, turned drums, wheel
&gt; cylinder's and hose's. Cost me about 200.00 for everything. It stops on a
&gt; dime.

I have just had the same experience - rebuilt(replaced) drums, shoes,
hoses, new cups in cylinders - 1&quot; of free pedal, stops on a rupee! Feels
like a power brake! I didnt know 64's came with power brakes.
