  Schofield rockers are the best out there, WW/Brazilian are WAY WRONG.

I do not like to use the reference of &quot; WW sheet metal&quot; as all the Brazilian stuff is crap from any vendor that sells it, 
including me (type2parts), except I tell you up front what to expect when using it

Here is my preferences
1. rocker;   scohfields     both sides and the short ones even. At least his cargo door rockers have/had the correct edge and depth for the seal.
 Use Brazilian and when you close the doors they will stick out 3/8 of an inch from the bottom. You need to highly modify the Brazilian to fit even close
2. Jack points;  MET WIZ
3. Cargo floors; ya right OG, patch your old ones or beg Schofield for some of his OE VW Brazilian ones
4 Front floors;  WW or any vendor that sells parts from  Brazil, just a note that their AREN'T any good aftermarket Brazilian
 sheet metal  pieces, reguardless of which vendor they come from.
5. Try to find VANG (Denmark) or IPG (Italy), very hard to find, but they both made/make some split bus sheet metal or have somebody in Mexico and/or Brazil go to 
the dealer and get it for you

6. I now have 3 buses to use for sheet metal (unless someone buys the 15 window$$$) it is worth more to me for rust 
free sheet metal then what the bus restored would take to do.

7 Save one bus or cut up a couple to help save a bunch of buses

&gt;..........
&gt;&gt; buy a WW body metal part. WW/brazilian parts dont fit worth crap.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; WW jackpoints= junk
&gt;&gt; WW rockers= junk
&gt;&gt; WW short rocker = junk
&gt;&gt; WW top hats = junk
&gt;&gt; WW cargo floor = junk
&gt;&gt; Same story every time. Spend 5 times the amount of time making it fit right
&gt;&gt; and modifying it and
&gt;&gt; when you get done, you wonder why you didnt just make it from scratch.
&gt;&gt; -Wade..............
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, just getting ready to order WW rockers, jack points, outriggers, etc.
&gt;for my 65 Deluxe Westy(?). What about Alan Scofield's products-2-3 times the
&gt;cost (_at_ Bus Depot), but worth it???? I know Kelly makes his up to order, so
&gt;looking for something off the shelf. I did compare an inner rocker side by
&gt;between WW &amp; Scofield &amp; it appeared they were slightly different depth,
&gt;corner radius, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Inquiring minds need to know,
