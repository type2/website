Subject: re:speaking of '67 master cylinders

was writ:
&gt; The master cylinder pushrod looks okay to me as well. So, I took a look at
&gt; the master cylinder and found it to be a very, very old looking ATE one.
&gt; Could this be my problem? How would I know if so?

What I have found with my master cylinder-is that it looks really old, very
quickly. The fluid inside(the brake fluid) is hygroscopic and super toxic(i
think that is what it's called) anyway I think this stuf causes the master
cylinder to rust in an aggresssive fashion, which makes them appear older
than they are....
