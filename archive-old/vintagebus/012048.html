&gt;I'll throw my self-absorbed hat in the ring too with a question, how do
&gt;you volks deal with local ordinances having to do with old,
&gt;&quot;junker/eyesore&quot; vehicles, especially in multiples? I'd love to get 
hold
&gt;of parts vehicles to do with as I please but the &quot;Nice Looking
&gt;Neighborhood&quot; Nazis have been at me before, and I don't want to go 
there
&gt;now.    Mark   Saginaw, Mich.                               '66 SC

Some have pink flamingos, some have bondo busses. 
Its not a junker its just retro, neo modern, classic period, tactile, 
ART.
Hell, its Friday.

Or available for a limited time: the all over bus cover. It is painted 
with windows, tires, everything you need to cover that &quot;neighbor 
annoyer&quot; and fool them into thinking you have a fully restored classic 
vw! Also available, bus cover &quot;hedges&quot;. Yes they will think you have 
just re-landscaped!

BTW, I wish I had more space. My yard is full. When I bought my house 
and went to move in, (two months later) the previous owner and I had an 
argument (he wouldn't get out!), and said I would ruin the neighbor hood 
with my TWO, count them TWO busses in the drive. Since then the 
neighbors two houses down have gotton one, as well as three houses down. 
So much for ruining the neighborhood. I guess the disease is spreading!
