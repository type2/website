&gt; all outside handles                 100.00
&gt;
No way!   Everything else I agree with.

&gt; these are conservative estimates (forgot the shelves)
&gt;
The shelves are the sh!t, rarest of the rare, factory installed, never seen
before outside factory literature, I'd kill my own mother to get a hold of
them, hahaha.

&gt; I hope my 55 deluxe isn't as bad as this or maybe I'll just part it out,
arrival date is a week from next Wednesday.
&gt;
Dibs! :)   So it's being shipped to ya?
