  I must say Thankyou to John, (vwhoward), and his most understanding wife,
Denise, on taking the time on Easter Sunday to come and tow my SC home.
I know John was very busy prepping his bus for KP and Denise needed her truck
returned in order to visit friends.
  &quot;THANKYOU BOTH&quot;
  Lou in soot
PS. John I'll get you a couple of NA beers on me!
