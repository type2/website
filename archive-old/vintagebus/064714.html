&gt; There is a &quot;bright&quot; and a &quot;dim&quot; filament and it is possible to install them 
&gt; backwards - the bulbs are keyed but some sockets make it easy to install 
&gt; them the wrong way.  The bright filament is nominally 7 times as bright as 
&gt; the dim filament, so you should notice quite a difference between dim and 
&gt; dim+bright when the bulbs are installed correctly.

Hi Volks,
Possibly could be the wires are switched on each taillight!

&gt;&gt;Possibly normal at idle.  If it goes out when you rev the engine a little
then it's probably OK.&lt;&lt;

If the generator idiot light does not dim down to at least barely noticable 
at night with the headlights on, check out the proceedure for rectifying the 
problem in the VW bus 1963-67 shop manual section E-2, page 14.
