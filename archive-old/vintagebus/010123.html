Ok. I am tired of getting home after 12 hours of slaving for the government
and having 50 emails of everyone wanting the same parts. I like to help, but
I can't handle all this. I dont do this to make money, this is a hobby. I
couldn't keep track of all these emails if I wanted to. Call me a pos I
really dont care, I dont feel like putting up with it. Parts I promised to
Greg and Everett are going to them as I have been chatting with them from
the get go. thatvwguy, the roof is yours if you still want it. Not that I
haven't been chatting with anyone else, but I honestly (no offense)dont
remember. I know I mustve promised that Berlin Tag to 3 different people.
Its going up for auction. Plain and simple. If you are one of teh three
people I told could have it, sorry. Like I said I can't keep up with it,
especially that darn Berlin tag. I dont know what the deal is with that. If
you want it, bid on it. It'll be on ebarf tonight. I know I have been
talking to you Steve, and if you email me again, I will try to square you
away as well. There is one other person who wanted interior trim for $50 and
berlin tag. You can still have the trim if you want it, but no tag. If you
dont want it, i understand. If I promised anyone else any parts, and you
really need them, email me again and I'll try to help. Anyone else, sorry
but I can't help unless your bus is broke down for this part or something.
Whatever is left I will have my wife ebay for me. Everyone mentioned please
email to my aol addy. Sorry if I pissed anyone off. Dont flame me, I'll
delete. I dont want to hear it. I'm not a business and dont need anyones
money. You dont like me, put yourself in my shoes. This has just been way
too much. I understand when you need parts, but damn, there must be 1000
lurkers on this list all looking for early parts. ..then again, I guess
there probably is. Anyways, good luck with all of your searches, and I
apologize once again if I can't follow through with any deals.
