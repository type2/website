Thom wrot:

I am in the middle of negotiating the purchase of a double-door panel with
the famed mcode 199.  What would this bus be worth &quot;done&quot;

What it boils down to is this: this would be a cool, unique bus to restore,
but do I really need a *4th* bus?  How rare is the 199 option?  What is the
360 option?  It also has 175.
------
199 is very rare, I have never seen one in person, and have heard of only a
few (3?).    Sliding sunroof standard micros are more common. (I have seen 4
or 5)
It beats the beans out of a 23/21 window for rarity
360 is an import to us code
175 in overriders on the bumpers

yes it would be a cool unique bus to restore.   Double door panel with swivel
seat.  Very cool. No idea of worth.  The guys into the commericals would be
psyched.   ?ask charlie hamil?  Think it has a pass seat, but I don't know-
someone on this list has a 199 bus, he should know.   Whether or not you need
another project is what you should figure out.     Wonder what happened to the
rusty weinie wagon (67 panel with sales flap on one side, sliding door on the
other, and steering/ig lock) I saw in oregon.
