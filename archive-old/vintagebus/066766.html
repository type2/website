Subject: Re: [VB] fixing a rusty gas tank??

If Clara's way is too easy for you, here's the hard way:
Go to the aviation supply store and buy a quart of Alcohol-Resistant Sloshing
Sealer. Follow the directions, which will lead you to remove the tank and do a
bunch more work too. Good stuff, but a quart of it will set you back $20 to $30.
It lines the tank in vinyl, repeat application to build up a thicker lining. The
solvent is pretty nasty stuff, take real safety precautions, read the
instructions on the can. Don't pour the used solvent down the drain, please.
The aircraft supply store has all sorts of other goodies. If you need high
pressure hoses and fittings for an oil filter/cooler or the like, they have some
of the best stuff. They do know aircooled engines...
