DO not waste your money of that stuff (B-Quiet) I tried it on one of my other 
cars... It went on easy enough, a lot easier than Dynamat, BUT when it got 
hot outside (summer) the adhesive started to melt and it would slide around 
or down AND it bled through the vinyl backing and it's nasty when that 
happens (stains your hands and whatever clothing/interior that touches. Just 
spend the extra $$ on Dynamat ( I know I will when I have a bus with an 
interior) It really doesn't cost that much more.
Thanks,
Brian
