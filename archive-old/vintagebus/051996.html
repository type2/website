&lt;&lt; ohn,
      I to have noticed the change too, who'd would have thought a baywindow 
 camper would sell for 4 grand.  When I first got into the world of cyber 
VW's 
 back in the early 90's things were way different.  On Prodigy there was a 
 group of maybe 20 of us, this was before IM's, free website hosting,and 
 Prodigy gods would pull your post if you tried to sell anything.  Hence, 
most 
 of us were there just because we loved VW's.  It was major cool, but time 
has 
 this thing about moving forward. &gt;&gt;

In the late 80s a guy I knew sold his bay window camper for  $4 grand.  It 
was a nice, clean camper.
