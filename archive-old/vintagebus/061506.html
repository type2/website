&gt; &gt;Now that we are coming into another rainy season, what do you think about
&gt; &gt;applying silicone seal to the cans, will the seal siphon into the cans
&gt; &gt;during the dry period or do you think it will be OK ?

Trying to seal up a component completely is usually not a good idea unless
you design it specifically that way.  Normal changes in air pressure and
temperature conspire to break the seal.  Condensation will be trapped
within, another bad thing.

Also, RTV tends to liberate acetic acid upon curing, which is why it
smells like vinegar.  This can also promote corrosion unless the vapors
are vented.

Just make sure that there is a vent on the bottom of the housing and
everyone will be happy.

George
