Subject: wanted/sell/trade at BBTA - New Tents/Carver P4's too?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I'm going to be at BBTA and I would love to find a camp stool for my '74
Campmobile.  It does not have to match my blue/green plaid, since I have extra
material and can recover.  If you got one, e-mail me with what you want for
it.

Also wanted:

Rear upper storage cabinet.  I'm not sure what year, but '76 -'79 maybe?  I
want to put one of these in my '74 Campmobile

For trade:

1 (Still in wrapper) Vanagon Camper Model kit.
1 Weber progressive carb kit for '72- up bus (slightly used)

New Tents?
Partial trade for camp stool, if they arrive on time.  I have an order of 10
new German Side tents on the way, but I'm not sure it will arrive before the
weekend.  There is always hope.  I have 7 Tramp tents, and 3 Nizza tents on
the way.
Tents can be seen at:

Carver P4 Heater.

I'll have one on display and will be taking deposits if you want to order one.
I doubt I'll have it installed in time.  I guess I'll just have to hope the
weather doesn't turn cold this weekend.

I hope to see lots of you this weekend, and I encourage everyone who has one
of the New German tents to come out.  It would be really cool to see a bunch
setup.  I'll have my new huge Casa Royal tent if I can find enough room to put
it up.  Look for the Yosemite Yellow '74 Campmobile next to the huge tent.
Stop by for a FREE BEER.
