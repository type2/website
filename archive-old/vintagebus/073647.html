Subject: Re: [VB] pre-heat

I got mine from Interstate VW Used Parts.  Got tired of striking out at 
the swaps.  They had a bunch of preheat tubes a couple years ago when I 
was there, you might give them a try.  (They were in Escondido then, 
address says Lakeside now.)

You can also inquire online, here's the link:
