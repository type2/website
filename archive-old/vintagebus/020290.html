Ellis agrees that caravaning sucks. Yeah, yeah, all of
the people as individuals are alright but all of this
linear cluster *ucking and endless circling of the
wagons drives me out of my mind. The caravan is either
so fast that you can't possibly keep up as happened on
the way from the Classic back to Rich Yosts when we
were driving the loaded down 36hp barndoor or too
freaking slow when we drive the hopped up trophy
whore. Someone is always either tailgating, begging to
be tailgated or blowing oil all over the buses behind
them. 

No offense to others but I like going my own pace.
Just give me good directions and see me there. 

BTW: Remember to put cotter pins in your rear axle
nuts this year. Two years ago some yutz lost his whole
drum/wheel combo on I-10 in a caravan to the Classic
from Phoenix. Now THAT was a clusterf saved by a
caravan.

---------------
No Classic this year for the Ellis brood. Y'all have
fun!
