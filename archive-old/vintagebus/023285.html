I removed the dash on the '54 a couple nights ago as part of the
dismembering process, and noticed a few things, and have some questions:

Questions:

Anyone know how to remove the colored bubbles for the idiot lights?
Anyone know how to remove the switches from the speedo plate?

Observations:

* My bus was built 12/54; the clock is dated 10/54 and the speedo 7/54.  I
think this should put paid to the phreaks that think everything on the car
must bear the same date code.

* A couple years ago I'd removed the clock to try and get it working.  I
broke something internally, although I can't recall what.  When I put it in
the dash, it would work for about 15-20 minutes, sometimes as much as an
hour, then stall.  I removed it, placed it face down on the table with all
the other stuff, and it's run perfectly ever since! (anyone have a really
nice or NOS clock FS?)

* I found where the Magic Speaker Wire comes out in the dash.  This one is
really wacky!  It comes thru a small channel (no pun intended) in the dash
stampings.  I don't know how one would feed a new one thru; given the
horrendous route this poor wire must take, fishing a new one would be
difficult at best.

* Andrew: yes, the pods *were* white; the previously unexposed sections of
the bakelight panels are white, and the rest of it eroded.
