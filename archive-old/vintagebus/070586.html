Subject: Re: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

Shame on you. Posting a non-bus related message on a Saturday! Shame!!

Be careful now, the speech nazis will get you.

Now I will talk about my bus. Its cool.  I only wish it were a'runnin'.
Anybody got a motor they want to give me? I ain't got the money to fix it.

Hmmmm.  Remember that statement old timers, I think my dad had a key
chain that said that in the late 60's??  Funny how small minded
statements never die....somethings never change.

Leave it, no way!  Question it, suspect it, challenge it, make it
better, you bet!!
&quot;IT&quot; was founded on descent.  Be a sheep and follow the corporate heard
if you want, just don't call me un-American for questioning the
corporation's motives.
