&gt;i also have a 62 do you know what code 195   is??

no . 

 no one knows what m 195 is. 

  I wondered about this a lot.   I got some parts of a dead 62 that had m code
195.  I purused various lists of m-codes, published my VW and also published
by other people and confusingly paraphrased form the lists published by VW.
I consulted with D Easterwood who was compiling the neato m code survey and he
had listed I think about 8 with m 195 all f which were around 61 62 or 63.   I
thought it was the sliding drivers seat on the 62 walkthrough, which was odd
to me when I saw it in the 62 M195 parts bus.   Contributing to this theory is
the tendency of &quot;like&quot; modifications to be grouped with each other, and the
swivel drivers seat is M199.    But some of the buses with m 195 in the neato
survey were bench seat buses, or even single cabs or double cabs.    And then
found out that a sliding drivers seat was standard on walkthroughs from july
of 61- a year before non walkthroughs got a sliding drivers seat. - with it's
own unique seat july 61 to july 62, so though it was nice to solve that puzzle
it still left the m 195 unsolved.   Bs seemed like your basic mouse grey/white
37 year old standard micro that had had a custom homemade wooden highroof aka
methlab buildt in it, then been pushed round a field with a bulldozer and
finally  left in the rain to me.   I put the kick panels in my 61, cause they
were the right colour.
