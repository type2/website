Subject: wheel and tires

due to various reasons, including, the tires on the 15&quot; bug rims on the front 
of my 61 being old and cruddy, I got the 185/70/14 tires put on a couple 
pretty powdercoated 14&quot; bus rims  (the rims for my 65) today and put them on 
the front of my 61.   
It does handle better.  And jeez louise! the difference in size between the 
rear tires (205/75/15s) and the front is incredible.    I am over 15 by the 
speedo before I shift into 2nd, almost 35 when I shift into 3rd, and about 
&quot;50&quot; when I go to 4th (which was about 40 on the speedo when all 4 tires were 
the same size).    This is a great way of giving an illusion of going 
fast!!!!     also gives it that kewl tilted down in the front look.   Now I 
am very unclear on my actual speed when I look at the speedo.   Well, I can 
tell by the motor sound.    

In any case, I am very happy with the shiny wheels.   They make my ratty bus 
look great.  If I had rivets handy I would have put the hubcap clips on, and 
polished up some hubcaps for it. 

  Who had bolted the clips on?  There is not much clearance on the inner side 
of the rim there- what kind of bolts did you use?  They must have had flat 
heads.

Happy Birthday Thom!
