&gt;I am contemplating putting a 5 speed trans into one of my Buses. Probably a
Porsche unit.  guessing a 914, 912, or early 911 trans would do the trick&lt;

Ummmm.... Why?

The 914s tranny is a four speed anyway and I think the 912 is also.

The 911 came with two mainstream trannies, a 901 and 915.  The 915 is
considered superior to the 901, but the 915 is a PITA to shift and would
likely break the bus linkage in no time at all.  Also the 915 likes to shift
at high RPMs that the bus motor cannot touch.  Plus do you have $1500-2500
sitting around for a good rebuilt 915 tranny?  They only last 50-80K miles
when treated nicely, first gear syncho dies.

The stock VW tranny should be able to handle up to 150HP without problems.
Is your engine killing trannies or something?  If you are using that much
juice then you would have already dropped the reduction boxes anyway so I am
guessing you have a mild engine.

Maybe look into the Gene Berg 5-speed.  Or just get a freeway flier trans
with a taller 4th gear.

This query perplexes me...
