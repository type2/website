I used a 35 gallon plastic garbage bucket, TSP, water, and a $6.00 water
heater element and some wire and a plug.  Just don't submerge the
connectors from the element and you have a rockin' parts boiler.  If yer
careful ya don't even burn a hole in the side of the garbage barrel.  If
you were REALLY clever you could add a water tank thermostat and just
leave it plugged in instead of having to check on it every hour or so.
