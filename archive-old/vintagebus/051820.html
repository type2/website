Subject: Re: [VB] Newbie alert!

Thanks, Matt!

You're right, admitting I have a problem is the first step.... hehe...

Tell your friend that the only way a 1970s R100 can hit 140 is by driving
off a pretty high cliff; they were only ever rated at about 127 mph. Of
course, I only know this from literature.... And it's blank, but still
pretty cool looking with the &quot;S&quot; fairing.

BTW, I've had the Bentley's for a few years, it's pretty damn handy. Any
comments from anyone re: usefulness of VW parts manuals CDs I've seen on
ebay? It says that it has a few different manuals plus ads, wiring diagrams,
brochures, etc. Thanks for the tips on checking in while on the road and
color diagrams on the web; I wasn't aware of those. See, I'm learning stuff
already!!

way too many friggin' vehicles for a 1 car garage.....

&gt; &gt;My name is Alex Vieira and I've been involved with VWs since I was
&gt; &gt;a teenager.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Alex!
&gt;
&gt; Remember, admitting you have a Bus is the first step.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm also into aircooled BMW twins
&gt;
&gt; Toaster or blank?  (Or is that just a /5 thing?)  :)  My roommate has
&gt; a '76 R75/6.  According to him, his won't get all the numbers on the
&gt; 140 MPH speedo, but your R100 will.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;So, I guess I should ask right off the bat, are there any subjects that
&gt; &gt;generally cause nothing but strife and disagreements on this list, e.g.
&gt; &gt;which oil to use, whether to do custom or stock restos, etc.?
&gt;
&gt; You picked two of them right off the bat.  The charter
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebuscharter.html has a little more information.
&gt; Some other &quot;hot topics&quot; are tires (what size, load rating, etc), 009
&gt; distributors pro and con, complete bonestock restos with NOS Wolfsburg
&gt; air in the tires vs pop-rivets and Bondo, etc, etc.  Most of these topics
&gt; don't cause flame wars so much as they are discussions that come around
&gt; periodically - sometimes new info comes out with each iteration but
&gt; sometimes not.
&gt;
&gt; You have probably found these resources already but here they are:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect/  Web reflector for the
&gt; vintagebus list.  You can't post but you can read all you like.  Handy
&gt; to use if you're traveling or whatever and can't get to your regular
&gt; e-mail account.
&gt;
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/search-vintagebus.html  Archive of the
&gt; mailing list.  Lots of good info here.
&gt;
&gt; http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/  Lots more good info.  This site is run
&gt; by the moderator of the vintagebus list, Thom Fitzpatrick.
&gt;
&gt; The reprint of the Bentley workshop manual for '63-'67 Buses.  If you
&gt; don't have one, get one - it answers _many_ questions.  The only thing
&gt; it lacks is color - you can the wiring diagrams in color (scanned out of
&gt; original manuals) at vintagebus_dot_com .
&gt;
&gt; http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/  Scanned parts manuals and
&gt; literature, including Bus parts manuals covering '50-'54 and '58-'67.
&gt;
&gt; Welcome!
