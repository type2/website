This is a general question about daily driving.  

I have recently acquired (as you know by now) a 1966 Standard Microbus 
outfitted with a 67 tranny and 71 dual port beetle engine.  I am currently 
using a 1970 Westy as a daily driver.  I mean EVERY day and EVERYWHERE from 
20 miles a day to 200 miles a day.  It is a beater and leaks oil like a sieve 
but gets me everywhere I need to go and with regular maintenance with brakes, 
bearings and struts has never let me down.  Now, can I expect the same 
results from my 66?  I hear about people replacing the standard trannys with 
later models for better freeway use.  Is this necessary?  Can I expect the 67 
tranny to have a reasonable lifespan with highway driving?  Can it handle 
speeds of 60-65 MPH for long periods of time?  I would like to scale my 
collection down to one bus (for economical reasons mostly) but don't want to 
stifle my wandering spirit.  Do other early sixties bus owners drive their 
buses daily?  Do you put tons of mileage on them and are they stock or did 
you modify?  I like stock but I prefer functionality.
