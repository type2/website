&gt; that is forcing the main needles off their seats and allowing excessive
fuel
&gt; into the carb bowls. He asked about the size of the main needle and seat
and
&gt; I'm afraid I couldn't remember. I DO remember looking at the number on the
&gt; side of the seat one of the times the carb top was off, but I don't
remember
&gt; the number that was there. He also made the suggestion of placing another
&gt; gasket beneath the fuel pump to reduce the pressire a bit.

    fwiw, berg sells a ball-type needle and seat replacement for idf carbs,
but i don't know if that would fix the problem. you may have to see what
size needle and seat is currently being used, so you can get the proper
replacement.
