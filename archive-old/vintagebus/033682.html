Subject: RE: Jerome/Bunch of Stories

You know I changed everything on the bus. New hoses (brake) rgb stub axle
and bearings, all new brake shoes, seals, cylinders, hoses, gear oil. Lubed
her up good, new fuel tap and screen, new fuse block, fixed all the wiring,
new tailight assemblies. Everthing was beautiful, TILL the only two things I
didn't change failed!!! The trans imput shaft seal and the shift coupler,
live and learn. So after driving sooooo sloooow I ordered a 3.88 trans for
her today (will still use the small nut RGB's) and am building a 1600 single
port. New crank, rods, p/l and heads with an airplane grind cam.

One way we discovered was he probably passed us
while we were changing my shift coupler at a gas stop.
