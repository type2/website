I prefer just using standard foam and cutting it to fit.  I get 30&quot; x 60&quot; x
1&quot; foam and hog-tie it to the frame.  I put almost 50K on my bus before I
sold it and they still looked new.  I do prefer the TMI seat covers though,
they fit good and the qualityis nice.

Rumor has it that the WCM seat covers are supposed to be pretty nice too, but
haven't actually seen any yet.  Last I heard they had rented another building
a few doors down and started to buy machines to make interiors.

I used to work for TMI and although the owners are a bit screwy, they do make
a really nice product.  It's amazing what daddy's money can buy nowadays!!
