Subject: More Info on VW Camper &amp; Commercial Magazine

&gt; As promised, I now have the current Issue # 3 of Volkswagen
&gt; Camper &amp; Commercial Magazine in stock. To recap, this is a
&gt; British magazine devoted exclusively to VW Campers. It has until
&gt; now been available only via overseas maiil directly from the UK.
&gt;
&gt; The price is $5.95 for an issue. (It's about $8 if you order from the
&gt; publisher and you have to wait 3-4 weeks for delivery from England.)
&gt;
&gt; Part number is CAMPERMAG . On the website, or order toll-free.


A few people had emailed me asking for some idea of the content of the
Volkswagen Camper &amp; Commercial Issue #3.  I had assumed that their website
would cover this, but apparantly it doesn't show much beyond a snapshot of
the cover.  So, here's a brief but incomplete listing....

An article on VW Bulli Sonderausfuhrengen (&quot;Special Models&quot;) trucks, with
pictures and ad copy
A feature on a '66 poptop camper (a Canturbury's-Pitt Motor-Caravan
conversion)
A feature on an '89 Reimo-conversion poptop camper
Part 2 in a series on rebuilding the wasserboxer engine
An article with color photos of a complete frame-up restoration of a '72 bus
An article on repairing body rot on Busses
Coverage of several VW shows with a ton of pics of VW campers of all ages
that are unlike any sold here
Tons of color photos throughout, plus the requisite classifieds, letters,
etc.
ads from European parts houses (maybe you can give me some ideas of what to
import!)

This magazine is definately enjoyable reading, even if just to see what our
lucky friends &quot;across the pond&quot; get to enjoy.
Highly recommended..
