 I have the same type of rack but for a beetle.  When you hear about the cups, please let me know.  Thanks!  I was told to try RV/camper type places, but haven't been able to find anything.

&gt;I purchased a roof rack this weekend that has 10 suction cup type feet on 
&gt;it. The cups screw on and are about 3&quot; across where the meet the roof. Has 
&gt;anyone ever seen this style or know where I can get some of the cups ? I 
&gt;should have a picture of it soon, so if you want to see what I am talking 
&gt;about, just email me off list.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
