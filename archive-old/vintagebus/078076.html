Subject: RE: [VB] Redux Boxes?

  Kyle of Westfailure fame is running a 2180 or bigger in the FuBarVee (the
59 deluxe motor home) with a Rancho Pro Street center with small nut RGB.
The bus has been to Burning man and back. Havasu and back and is now on a
Journey into Mexico. Mind you this is an extremely over weight bus and he
pulls a trailer  with it also and has not hurt the RGB's yet.
  I have put as large as a 2054 with RGB and the 1800 strokers I build make
as much HP and torque as Jakes mild T4 bus engines and I have never had a
RGB problem.
   If you were drag racing you might hurt them (I'll let you know next drag
season) 
as I am building a 2332 or there abouts to use in a Hot VW's DRAG DAY bus I
am going to try and have together for the 2004 1/8 mile drag season


ronnieps. The only RGB I have seen handgernaded was a off road car and they
had lost a bearing, it got between the gears and was shot through the
housing like a bullet, the GEARS did not have a mark!

Well, I was talking to Jake Raby at a show a few months ago, telling him
about putting a type 4 in my bus; and he said that I would need to do
something about the redux boxes because the gears aren't all that strong and
will shatter with all the torque that a type 4 engine has.  Any truth to
that?

&gt; Yes,
&gt; The redux boxes are extremely stout if all of the bearings in them
&gt; are fine.  They will deal with most any motor.  People change out the
&gt; reduction gear boxes when they want to change the final gearing on their
&gt; bus and when lowering.  I like redux boxes!  Gary Gibson
