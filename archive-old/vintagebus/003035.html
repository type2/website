I drilled my rivets off and had the pieces re chromed... I kinda wish I
would have tried to save the rivets as I spent around $40 to make the two
rivets.. ouch!  Actually, I think if others needed the rivets, we could have
them made for around $5. each.... things are always cheaper when you make
multiples.

The springs are easy to wind once you know what to make... so if you could
send me a picture or tell me what the springs look like, that would be
great.

Speaking of making things... anyone need some empi camber compensator
cushions???? This is another item I would be interested in reproing...

Thanks much!

i'll try to take a look at mine this weekend...currently i still have both
of
them. The one on the gas cap
door works properly, the one to the engine compartment is kind of stuck in
the
open position. the
spring is still in there, so it springs back and forth...it just doesn't
stop
in the right spot. i bought a
replacement, but it was such thin piece of crap, i never replaced it.  your
question may be the
incentive to try and fix the one i have...although i am a little worried
about
breaking it..
