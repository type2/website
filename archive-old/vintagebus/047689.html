&gt;How does one go about joining NEATO now that their website has ceased to 
&gt;exist? The site was starting to be pretty good and then financial 
&gt;responsibilities made them pull the plug. Does anybody know if they plan to 
&gt;put a site back up?

The site should be back up soon.  If you would like information, contact me, 
Neil Pickett at npbusguy_at_aol_dot_com I am the North Carolina NEATO chapter rep. 
and can mail you or put you in touch with the info.  
Looking forward to hearing from you and other folks interested in joining the 
club.
Neil Pickett
