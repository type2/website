Subject: Re: [VB] bus jams

&gt;I never found a five disk magazine that I could hide properly and as
&gt;rough as my vans ride a low end player would skip a lot....
&gt;Oh! By the way, my front doors don't lock.

i finally bit the bullet and bought a used ipod with an accessory  fm 
transmitter unit.
stores a coupla hours of music as mp3s, broadcasts over my radio.

that is, if i HAD a radio! i'm going to get a cheap one and stick it 
under the seat, as all i need it for is to pick up the ipod signal 
and power speakers. might even consider a sapphire if i can find a 
working one :)
