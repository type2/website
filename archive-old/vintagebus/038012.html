Subject: BBB BREAKDOWN!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Former list-lurker and fellow club member Chris Burke took my brothers 67 
SO42 to Havasu this morning.  Didn't make it.

He currently is at a pay phone in Parker.  The bus is sitting at mile marker 
16 on Hwy 72 about 3 miles east of the 95.

According to him there was a loud noise that had occured. Possibly a rod.  
Anyone on the list know of a way to contact anyone at the BBB show?  Cell 
phone or whatnot?

Dan Howard
