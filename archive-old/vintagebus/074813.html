Subject: Re: [VB] Fall OCTO

&gt; Hmmm.  No mention of OCTO last Sunday, so I'll do the Readers Digest version.
&gt; 
&gt; Great weather as usual
&gt; Average to small attendance (bug stock was going on so some people left early)
&gt; Small to non existent swap (didn't even pull out my wallet)

&gt; Fun as usual...if you weren't there you should have been.

Yeah, I had planned to go, but family obligations kept me home.  But 2 out
of 3 OCTO's this year isn't bad. 8 out of state shows this year is my limit.
Plan to go to the Winter OCTO show but BBB8 will be the next. Bring/Save
some goodies for us out of towners.
