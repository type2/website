Subject: Re: [VB] That bus at Barrett-Jackson

I am very familiar with this bus--as I know the owner who restored it--In
fact I sold the seller the roof rack--This was a restoration from Hell!!  It
took well over a year to complete the bus.  A total ground up
restoration---the restorer was Glenn, a dear friend of mine that had a LOT
of trouble getting the bus done   and his son died while this was going
on--it is VWonderful bus--, uj
