&gt; Let's talk about, oh.... HEAT IN A BUS?  

Perfect!


I need the heat tube for under ther rearmost bench
seat. The one that goes from left to right, it fits
onto the heat pipe which comes through the tranny hump
(or whatever you call that part of the rear cargo
floor which turns upwards to eventually become the
luggage area)

Anyway, my bus has the tube coming out of the
firewalll area and that's it. How does the sideways
(underseat) tube fit on that? And does anyone have
one?
