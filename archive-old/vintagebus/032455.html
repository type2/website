Hi Folks - from Dre:

&gt;... I was thinking about covering the entire underbody with POR-15 but how 
&gt;to prep the surface?? I've got a guy that does sand blasting.... he tells 
&gt;me to blast it with plastic........ any
&gt;thoughts? anybody done that? We here in the Midwest (Chicago) don't have 
&gt;too many choices....


 From Por-15's web site I note that although they sell two different metal 
preps they say that the paint itself doesn't mind seeing some rust left 
behind - gives it a little tooth to bond with.  Painters likely cringe at 
this approach, but I'll try this out on the top and inside beds of the '61 
SC.  I've convinced myself that my Metabo grinder and a couple of braided 
wire wheels will take down the rust and grime just fine thank you.  I'll 
use one of the metal preps next and, finally, their top coat as Por-15 
itself apparently breaks down under our Sonoran UV.  This looks like ~$180 
worth and a good mask/ventilation needed when I go after the inside.  Btw, 
they now make a putty consistency version which I'm going to try to plug 
small holes with.  I'm hoping for a durable and decent looking fix.

But... no sandblasting needed - and perhaps not for your application 
either.  Wash it down with whatever needed to get rid of any other road 
dirt, grease, etc.  Comm'l plastic scrubbers and hot soapy water, the local 
car wash, maybe some sanding on the rust.  By this time you might decide to 
undercoat it with asphalt emulsion - it's messy to apply by brush but cheap 
and two coats have lasted 20 yrs under my loaf.
Nick.
