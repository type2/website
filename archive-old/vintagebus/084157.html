Subject: shifter problem

The shift rod bushing directly underneath the shifter on my 56 bus was 
missing so I installed one tonight.  However, now I am unable to get the 
bus in to reverse.  I have the lockout plate with the ridge on the 
passenger side and the slope forward.  The bus has a tunnel tranny and 
has what appears to be a straight shifter but I am no early bus expert.  
Is there a spacer underneath the lockout plate?  I spent lots of time 
trying to get it to go but it won't.  All other gears will engage.  
Also, the early shifters have aren't peened right?

thanks
rob
