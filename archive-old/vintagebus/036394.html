 &lt;&lt;&lt; there's a lot more ways to bust rust then wheels (old school)
i first use the wire to get rid of the scale, then use my spot blaster
or don't use that at all and just use rust mort or mirachem 250 (made
in tempe az.)
technology has come a long way since the wire wheel and if you read the
directions on rust mort you will see that they DO NOT want the rust
removed or it will not convert!!!! ever try to grind a rustmorted
panel?? hard as a rock
as for mirachem 250 it's a rust remover and inhibitor that leaves a
paintable phosphat coating, i have been doing this for over 20 years
but mostly on 356 porsches and cars that i have done 15 years ago are
still rust free, why work yourself to death when there are products to
make life simpler, sometimes new school is better then old school,
thats why we use bondo instead of lead and
i still have all my leading tools, maybe i'll go back to grind and sand
and lead instead of bondo, heck we have all the time in the world

 Hi Eric&amp;Barb,
&gt; 
&gt; What sort of acid do you use?  How is it applied?  Where do you get
it?  It sounds like I could use a 55 gallon drum of it.

&gt; Exactly, that is why we alter between the acid and wire wheel.  Each
runs 
&gt; into a point where they just slow down to almost a stop at working,
but if 
&gt; you alter between the mechanical shock and chemical action, the rust
removes 
&gt; very quickly.
