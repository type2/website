&lt;&lt; i just got the new vw trends in the mail today and
 your panel bus was in there. they did an article on
 the kelly park show feauring your panel (does it have
 a name?) in a small, captionless picture. you're
 famous! &gt;&gt;

Isn't this twice for the now famous panel?

BTW,  I just picked up the August issue of Volksworld (at Barnes and Noble) 
and there is an excellent article on the recent OCTO meet in it!   Also, 
coverage of their &quot;BugJam&quot; event which is advertised as the largest VW 
festival in Europe!  The aerial view picture of this event (p.27) shows a 
HUGE show, puts the classic to shame.  Anyone on the list been to  this show? 
 For you gearheads, this issue has a great article with lots of pictures and 
drawings detailing the original development of the 1934 and 1935 prototype 
engines that Porsche designed on his way to the classic flat four we all know 
and love!
