I support the great suggestion toward Go Westy as made
by my buddy, Kyle. 
It will be debated indefinitely, but I believe that
the handles (Part #231-067-965) were originally in all
of the vertical positions whereas a more boxy
three-sided, hard plastic handle, (with the opening on
the bottom) were used in all of the horizontal
postitions. Similar, if not same push button protrudes
through the handle. This comment is only pertaining to
the SO42 interior. I have no defintive insights re:
the SO44's or any of the the earlier beasties.
The horizonal handles were used on the under Z-bed
front facing seat bottom and the horizontal drawer of
the icebox cabinet.
Westy interiors have been reworked and cobbled
together for years. I make allowances for the &quot;Westy
used what Westy had on hand that day&quot; arguments etc.
For today's world I'd say that Kyle's suggestion is
the best that you will find for the price. Keep your
eyes peeled at swaps and junkyards if you NEED to be
100% anal/correct~ or feel like you are.
I can't see paying $30+ ebay prices on these things.
Install what you can find and go camping!
