&lt;&lt; one of our redux boxes shears off bolts. &gt;&gt;
Hi, 
This could be due to several things.  Not using grade 8 hardness bolts, not
tightening the bolts properly, to the right tighteness and checking them for
tightness regularly.  Also how hard you are down shifting?  Remember that the
time to use the down shifting is on long mountian down slopes, especially with
a load.  The brakes otherwise do just fine and are easier and cheaper to
replace than wearing out your engine by down shifting constantly.   Eric &amp;
