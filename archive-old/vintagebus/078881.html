Subject: Re: [VB] poor gas mileage

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; The problem is that I'm only getting 18 mpg which can't be the best I can
do  in a '64 kombi. I've been doing a fair amount of city driving balanced
with a roughly even amount of 45-55 mph cruising at a rate of _at_ 180 miles
per week; I don't maintain speeds above 55. I've also been using high grade
gas.
&gt;
&gt; I've been considering a switch to a SVDA distro, as listed at
aircooled_dot_net, based on my research of the type2 archives. I'm hoping this
will cure my bus's gas-guzzling.
&gt;

I'd say, take the plug back out of the throttle plate (replace either the
throttle plate or the carb if you drilled it out larger to fit a rivet) and
install a vacuum dizzy. The 009 is killing your mileage, you can gain 3-4
more mpg with an SVDA.

My 64 bus, stock gear ratio's, stock size tires, got 24 1/2 mpg at 65mph,
and was able to hit 27 3/4 mpg at 60mph. This is highway mileage.  I never
measured city.
