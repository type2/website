Thanks for the help on the fuchs quest.
There are several Ways to get fuchs on the bus...some good and some bad.
For me it started with my brake upgrade... I made my own straight axel kit
at the back, and machined a type 3 hub to accept  a 911 carrera disk and had
some callipers adapters made so they bolt up where the brake shield used to
be. For hand brake I used willwood mechanical callipers. Up front I used the
Porsche hub and disk with a combination of bay/Porsche bearings and a
machined adapter for the carrera calliper. I got all my brake parts of a 84
911 Carrera. When I was done I bolted up my  6x15&quot; fuchs and was ready to
cruise...  simple really :-)

Thanks
Jon Hroar Ulstad

Jon writ:
&gt;Does anyone know where I can get a pair of old 4,5&quot; fuchs wheels? &lt;

Try:  http://www.wheelenhancement_dot_com  (sure to have them and will refinish
them for you)

Or if you want straight up used ones try: http://www.partsheaven_dot_com/


But how did you get Fuchs on your bus?  I know this question has come up
many times before, but no one gave the dirt on how to do it &quot;right&quot;.  A tech
article for the library would be very much appreciated.


Thanks,
