Question:  What is Clara's last name?   Is it Williams?  If so, I have yer
old bus!

This particular '66 walkthrough Westy is a bit rough here and there....and
there's a monster what howls like a cross between a banshee and police siren
living somewhere in the back....it doesn't like to go over thirty mph....

The motor feels great...and tonight was the first time I have ever felt a
dipstick &quot;just warm&quot; after an hour of serious driving.

After a few moments of unsteadiness, I got my splitty legs back, and I was
just so stoked that I could honk the horn...which I did....are those things
supposed to be that loud inside?!

What is the best way to remove house paint from a bus without damaging
potentially good layers underneath?

Look for a picture or two on the VintageBus gallery site.....

Later!  Gene

p.s.  We're thinking the bus's name might be Clara...(it was
Nugget....that'll be her middle name?!?)
