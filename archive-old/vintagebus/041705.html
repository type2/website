&gt; There are varying degrees of this I know, with
&gt; the barndoor at the head of the pack with the
&gt; tank above the engine, post-barndoor busses in 
&gt; the same compartment, and eventually getting
&gt; a panel barrier, and up to the Syncro Vanagons
&gt; with a firewall (sorta) between them, but still

Well, early Fords had the tank in the cowl, just aft and above the engine.
Just about every motorcycle ever built has the tank above the engine, etc.

I don't think that the tank position in a bus is as hazardous as some
think.  In a rear impact, the hard/hot parts of the engine will be pushed
under the tank and it'd take a heck of a hit to get to the tank itself.

If you get hit that hard, you have more to worry about than a punctured
gas tank!
