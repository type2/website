Hi All,

I'm still looking for a few correct bolts for the 59 double cab....  yea,
I've given up on the idea of it being done by sept. 1 2001 due to some
unexpected business travel and some other issues.   So, it just gives me
more time to find those right bolts and grommets.  :-)   My new goal is octo
2002.

I'm willing to pay 1-3 dollars a piece for the fasteners below and who knows
on NOS or good used grommets and seals...  if you got this stuff, lets
talk... I got $$$ burnin a hole in my pocket.

Anyway, here's a few current items I'd love to find.  I'm willing to pay for
peoples time to pull stuff.
**** indicates REALLY WANTED ITEMS!!!


****- 211 209 165 lever for fuel tap with Bowden cable retaining bolt and
set screw
- 211 711 169 Shift rod coupling

rubber and grommets
- NOS or nice rubber gate stops and cheese head screw hardware
****- 113 415 835 Dust seal for maintenance-free tie rod ends (see picture
on web site)
****- 211 711 167A sealing sleeve for transmission shift rod (2 needed)
- 211 721 395 Seal for clutch pedal bearing (I have a useable one but if
there is such thing as a NOS one, cool!)
- 211 721 621 Boot for accelerator pedal push rod
- 211 301 265 Bonded rubber mounting front for transaxle
- 111 301 263 Bonded rubber mounting rear for transaxle (2 needed)
- 111 209 095 Rubber cap for fuel tap
- 211 943 165B Boot, license light
- 111 721 365 Rubber sleeve – clutch cable (2 needed)
****- Original ‘one eyed duck’ for wipers
- 211 711 725 Rubber cap for bowden cable (3 needed)
- 111 711 691 Grommet for accelerator cable

- any new or good used door and window seals especially:
    engine lid seal,front door seals,cargo door seals

*** parts of certain originals gladly taken! ***

1 10 x 40 (DORN) hex bolt with washer and nut, steering stabilizer to frame
1 10 x 50 (DORN) hex bolt with washer and nut, steering stabilizer to
swinglever
2 4.8 x 13 cheese head tapping screws with washer (rear valance , I have the
speed nuts)
****2 4 x 12 cheese head screws and washers (4x15 mm also acceptable) Front
gate bumper stop
2 wavy washer for 5mm hex bolt (rear splash pan).
****3 4 x 10 0.7pitch domehead Phillips screws (window pop out latch to
body)
****3  8 x 1.0 fine thread nuts (14mm head) early tie rod clamp bolt… should
be a RIBE bolt.  I’ll take the bolts if ya got em.

Steering box bolts (don’t ask why I need these…)
  2 – 8x28 14mm head hex bolt dorn/kamax (one should have a tie wire hole)
  2 – 8x40 14mm head hex bolt dorn/kamax
  2 – 6x18 12 or 13mm head hex bolt dorn
  1 – 10x40 17mm head hex bolt kamax (I have 1)
   … I’ve noticed a discrepancy from what my box had in it vs what the
manual says as per the actual length of the 1st two bolt pairs…
