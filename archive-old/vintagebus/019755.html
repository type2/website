The original stuff was was a fribrous mat material, similar to
the horsehair padding, but much finer texture, almost like felt
in texture.  I've used plain rubber with good results.

&gt; Anyone have any suggestions on what material to use underneath the gas tank straps on the 4 top corners?  I'm not sure what the original material was, it's always too far gone in my buses to tell, looks like a horsehair type material or something.
