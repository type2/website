Those of us that have been on the list for quite some time will remember
with fondness, our dear late friend, Josh Rodgers.  Trudging thru some old
emails on a computer I don't use much anymore, I found one from him that I
had saved concerning getting some pictures scanned.  I think this message
from Josh captures his sprit:

beer.   Or..... maybe some Split parts.....
