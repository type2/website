Subject: RE: [VB] Camshaft Plug? now balancing

I have personally built at least 25 engines using the new case with the
rubber plug, My DD has the rubber plug 34,000 miles no leaks and I do have
countless Hot Rod engines out there with the same rubber plug without a
problem, so don't worry, VW Mexico has been doing this for years, I use a
thin coat of Hi Temp OEM silicon on these plugs, the only place on a VW
engine where I do use silicon (very carefully mind you). As for the
Brazilian case there are a few benefits, larger lifter (cam follower)
bosses, more and 
larger internal ribbing, 8mm case savers with deep stud No&quot;3, larger oil
pickup, and perfect cam and crank bores, build it right and 100,000 no
problem. 

Last night I broke out my Maestro book (he is the Guru of Porsche 356
engines) just to see what kind of longevity Porsche 356 engines should have,
in the back of the book he has compiled a list of Porsche owners and there
engines, miles etc. very concise, it was amazing to see how many people
averaged 150,000 miles on the top end and there were some up to 500,000
before a total rebuild. He attributed part of this to the old rule of OIL
CHANGE every 2000 miles and these engines had oil filters and to the
balancing of the major internal engine components by the FACTORY, so in
essence, building an engine have it BALANCED and CHANGE your oil. It should
last a long time.

Now when you have your rods sized or buy a set of rebuilt rods, check the
balance! even if who you bought them from say they are balanced, check them
again.(I furnish rod weights when I sell a set of balanced rods) Most places
just check the rod weights and make sure there within 3 I said yes 3 grams
of each other and if you get a set that's right on check the END to END
balance. The last set of rods I had balanced (for my 1776 single port) all
weighed the same but when we checked the END to END balance they were out up
to 1 1/2 grams, after a half hour of grinding and reweighing we got all rods
within 1/10 of a gram overall and END to END, this is only one of many
things that helps make for engine longevity.

  Hope I don't live to regret it.

One thing concerns me.  One of you mentioned &quot;glue&quot; for this plug.  Is
there something besides the Permatex case sealer I should be using to
hold the rubber plug in?
