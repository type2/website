Charles, List, 

&gt; I'm looking for a cross reference for the following 
&gt; paint codes into a base coat
&gt; clear coat system:
&gt; L380 Turquoise/L289 Blue white
&gt; L325 Mouse grey/L87 Pearl white

Glasurit's 2 stage finishes are 55 line and 90 line (low VOC).  
You can try to find the current formulas at Glasurit's web site:
http://www.glasuritnet_dot_com/glasurit/english/start.htm
and click on &quot;Color-Online&quot;.  Best to just contact a Glasurit dealer.  

It is of little help, since you want two stage, but in single stage (Glasurit 
22 line) some of the formulas are:
Mouse Gray L325 = Grau SK 9713 61-01 VW CL547921
Pearl White L87 = Pearlweiss 58-70 VW WH1849

Of course, if you have good origninal samples, any paint shop can color match 
in any of their lines.  If you want to go to the trouble of matching the 
original paint apprearance, single stage may be a better match, not as deep 
and shiny of course.  Just a thought.
