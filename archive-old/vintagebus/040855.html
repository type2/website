I had difficulty bleeding brakes one time, replaced the
rubber hoses, and still had problems.  I gave up and
sold it instead (other reasons too).  Current owner
informed me that it turned out to be the master cylinder,
so don't overlook that possibility, it bled strangely
so I replaced the hoses to no avail.

As for Kelly Park, my son &amp; I will be there looking
for T3 stuff for our resurrection of our '67 Sqbk,
drooling over the T34's, I REALLY like them, and
checking out the busses, for I still love them.

I'll be the 'other' guy with one of Thom's busses,
trailing around with a just barely pre-teen.

Jeff &amp; Neal '67 Sqbk resurrection &amp; no more busses (for now)
