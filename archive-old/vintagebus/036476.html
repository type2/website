&lt;&lt; Altho, from I5 out of the North you probably want to go West on Hwy 580, 
 then South on Hwy 680, then South again on Hwy 101.  The Tully Road exit 
 will be what you want to take west (right) to Senter Road.  Left on Senter 
 and Kelley Park will be at the corner of Phelan Ave on the left.  Now, I'm 
 trying to remember exactly, but 680 to 101 South might actually drop you 
 one exit too far south.  Just loop back onto 101 North if need be and exit 
 at Tully.

eeeesh, that'd get me lost.  If you're comming from So Cal or points there 
about, the easiest way to get to San Jose is to take the 5 north to the 152 
west to the 101 north to Tully road west and left on senter.

I dunno where Red Barn is, but it sounds like you'd take 101 south off the 
152 west.  Both sound relatively easy to find
