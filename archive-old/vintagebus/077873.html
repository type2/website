Subject: Re: [VB] re:bus stalling

hmm.. no, it wouldn't spontaneously rust up, though you could have a bad tank 
of gas.

the black (hot)  wire to the coil... if it is loose the engine wont have go.  
Could be loose in the back or up at the fuse box or to ig switch.

clogged fuel filters, as well as seeing just the orangey yellow paper filter 
in there, you see trapped crud through the plastic.     If you have a filter 
under the tank, check it.   I dislike filters under the tank... harder to 
check, annoying to change.   

Been driving my 67round town on &amp; off recently... put about 800 miles on it 
since it sat w/ PO a long time (since 96?), it's still getting dirty filters, 
but not stalling.

I've gotten a lot of suggestions that my tank is probably dirty or that I

Clara what do you mean by a loose wire? Any wire in particular to look at?

I believe I have two filters, one between the tank and pump (right under the
tank) and one between the pump and carb. It the filter between the pump and
carb is clogged I imagine I would see a lot of fuel in it (because the pump
would be jamming it with fuel and) so since that is not the case, it could
be the filter I have under the tank...although I don't remember if the last
time I replaced the fuel line if I used two filters...
