Thermostado de Sao Paolo

Opera Man ( Bye Bye:)

The currently available engine thermostat for type 1 engines
listed in catalogs as 040 119 059 and delivered as 111 119 159A
does not fit on a VW engine, neither in the original bracket nor
on the flaps rod, as the length is wrong.
It is more easily identified as not stock-looking, but as a coiled
brass wire with an exposed inner brass plunger, 80-85 C
replacement for the stock 65-70C unit also listed as 111 119 159A.
This item has been in the catalogs for many years.
I forwarded my discovery to RMMW a few months ago and
they claimed to be removing it from sale at that time.

Subject: [T2] Have thermostats changed on us?


&gt; After all these years without one, I decided to put in a thermostat on my
'71.
&gt; However some of the parts I have don't match the pictures and description
in
&gt; Bentley.
&gt;
&gt; First, I bought a new thermostat from one of the standard VW suppliers.
The
&gt; number marked on the box is 111.119.159A which matches the catalog for a
'71
&gt; bus. The number marked on the unit is 040.119.159.1 (this number is also
&gt; marked in fine print elsewhere on the box). This thermostat does not have
the
&gt; flat sided boss on the bottom so it can mate with the flat sided hole on
the
&gt; bottom of the bracket. It has about an 8mm stud coming out the bottom and
a
&gt; small bent down tab about 1/4 inch away from the stud. The supplied
nut/washer
&gt; barely overlaps the flat sided hole making secure attachment virtually
&gt; impossible. Am I missing something here or do I have an incorrect
thermostat?
&gt;
&gt; Second, my bracket looks like the photo in Bentley except the very bottom
of
&gt; the bracket folds under the case below the where the bracket mounts to the
&gt; case. The bracket mounting hole is not elongated so as to make adjustment
&gt; possible. I have maybe 1/16 inch at the most of up down movement on the
&gt; bracket. Does this sound right?
&gt;
&gt; Sincere thanks,
&gt; Bill Moon
