Subject: Question for you BBTB travelers

I've been doing some research and debating whether or not to go to the BBTB
event.  I wanted to go last year but I was in the middle of working on my
bus.

I've managed to find a round trip ticket from Omaha to Las Vegas, NV for
$168 and that is dirt cheap.  The price doubles if you want them to fly you
any closer to Havasu.  It's even more to go to Phoenix.

So I guess all that is left is to ask if any one is coming down through Las
Vegas or would like to shuttle me to the event and back (I'd be in Vegas on
the 18th and have to head home that Monday afterwards 22nd).  If I get the
ticket, then it says I would arrive at the Vegas airport at Thursday night
at midnight.  Then I'd have to be at the airport like late Sunday night at
midnight.

I know it would be a major sacrifice for anyone to haul me around down there
but you can bet I'd help on gas and food.

Anyway, if anyone can help, pmail me and we can discuss details.  If I can
get this part of the plans taken care of, I'll buy the tickets and go for
it. What the hell...
