The &quot;proper&quot; tool works great if the nut has perfectly formed slots, but
if there is the least defect in the slots (or on the lugs of the tool) it
won't work.  It also demands exact alignment of the tool or you will gotch
up the nut.

I use the &quot;proper&quot; tool when I can, but the internal wrench
will work even on a chewed-up nut.  I don't see many perfect nuts these
days!

An any case, a dab of anti-sieze when reassembling will make life much
easier for the next disassembly.
