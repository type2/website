&gt;Hi All
&gt;
&gt;Im getting feed up off lying on my back under my bus trying to get it =
&gt;clean. So I have now desided to make a rotiserie(???) so I can turn the =
&gt;bus around its lenght axis.
&gt;There has been some talking on the list about these before, so here is =
&gt;my question:
&gt;Where is the centre of gravity point on a empty kombi shell (without =
&gt;engine suspension's interior and gearbox)?  I want to make the bus as =
&gt;easy to turn as I possibly can.
&gt;Could somebody who owns somting like this give me the messure from the =
&gt;bumper-mounting holes to the &quot;turning point&quot;?


Jon,

On my first couple of attempts at making a rotisserie, I welded the head
that attaches to the bus in one solid piece, guessing at where the CG was.
But the CG changes if you leave in, or take out the front end, tranny and
engine.

So you want to make the part that attaches to the bus then fits into the
head adjustable.  You will not be able to adjust it while the weight of the
bus is hanging on it, but by supporting the bus, you can make the
adjustments, then put the weight back on.  You will also need to make the
head adjustable for height.

Making a rotisserie is a challenging job at best, if all you need to do is
roll the bus on it's side, I have made some &quot;bus rockers&quot; shaped like an L
that bolt onto the hubs.  They allow the bus to lay over, resting on the
upper part of the L.  The side of the bus is about 1 foot above the ground
when laying on it's side.  This allows you to weld, sandblast, paint or
whatever under the bus.  The only thing I wouldn't do is try to work on the
mechanics in this position, you might drop something out.

The only thing you have to do to get the bus ready is take out the battery,
drain the oil out of the engine and make sure the brake fluid will not leak
out.  It's best then to lift the bus up and put it on 4 jack stands, remove
both wheels on one side, take the bus back off the jack stands, and with
the help of a friend, roll the bus on it's side.  The L shaped rocker will
put the side to side CG almost to the center of the bus, so it doesn't take
as much to push it over as if it still had the wheels on it.

The advantage of the rotisserie over the bus rocker is you can work on the
underside without the mechanicals in place.
