Well as Thom said, you don't air out dirty laundry on the list - period.
Hey Thom - does it say this in the subscribe info?  Might be worth adding
since it seems to happen here occasionally.  Maybe it already is since
people can't read.

Anyway, I know Dan personally and can't help but think that there is a
misunderstanding somewhere.  Dan's been most kind and patient with me when
it comes to payment and he's really prompt when it comes to ordering my RMMW
stuff through him.
Try a personal phone call and keep your voice down - don't shout.  This can
really work wonders.  If you need the info, all you gotta do is discreetly
ask the list and someone can help you out.  I can't help but think this can
all be resolved because Dan is one of the most easy going guys I've ever
known.
