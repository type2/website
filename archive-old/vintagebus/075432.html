&gt; Last time I installed my new trans, I couldn't get it to shift gears and I was leaking gear oil.

&gt; 1. didn't know the paper shims between the axle tube ring and the trans case needed sealant. Okay, rookie manuever #1. I bought a caulking gun size tube of permatex blue silicone #6XX.

I hope you imaculately cleaned off all the oil from the surfaces before
you applied the silicone sealant - it won't stick to oily surfaces. I
recommend the Ultra-Grey or Black, as it's high-temp rated and resists oil
well -also sets up in 20 minutes, and it's a high density silicone
compound, not loose and rubbery. Permatex makes it, sold at all FLAPS.

&gt; 2. checked out the nosecone last night. I was able to activate each gear, one by one manually by pulling/pushing the sliders. I had them set up properly the first time. this means there's something in the linkage, either my mistake or maybe it's just so sloppy with age that it lacks the torque to move this tight new trans around.

You must be sure that your linkage can deal out the required leverage and
force, until the tranny lubes up and break in. It will be somewhat
difficult and stiff at the beginning - but shouldn't be unusually stiff or
really difficult. If you can set the gears using the sliders manually, you
should be alright. As Ronnie said, replace the coupler if it isn't stiff.
BE SURE that the two bolt holes are EXACTLY lined up - 1/16 th inch off is
a entire shift from 1-2 to 3-4. Find a coupler that 's made properly.
Don't settle for anything less. It won't work. I've seen couplers that
were so sloppily made, they couldn't possibly work. Ask me how I know!

Make sure that the entire shifting mechanism can take the load of the
stiff new tranny, and won't buckle anywhere. New bushings, solid coupler.
Make sure that the bottom stuff on the shifter up front works - the spring
loaded pin, lots of grease down in that area. Be sure that the
reverse-locking plate is installed properly. Use grease anywhere you feel
you need to.
