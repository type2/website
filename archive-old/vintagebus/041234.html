The one claiming it originally came with just one seat,
is a walkthru with the bulkheads cut out, very cleanly,
but nevertheless cut-out.  VW would never send
out a bus with double doors and no bulkheads!
Thery're much smarter than that.

If one truly wanted a single seat bus, remove every
bit of metal used for the passenger seat, and the
only bit left would be the wheel well, thereby leaving
lots of room for long items as implied.  Still left to
do is the necessary reinforcements.
