Subject: [VB] Decisions, Decisions... Found a restorable '67

Volks,

It has been a long time since I have had reason to post to vintagebus, but
today I looked hard at a rough but savable '67. It is a white hard-top,
non-walkthru Westfalia weekender (no pop-top).  The good parts are:

* Everything is present.  Got mirrors on both sides, stupid box for the
  turn signals is there, jalousie windows are good, etc., etc,
* Roof is straight and not rusted at all
* Nose is straight! 
* Bumpers are straight!
* Doglegs are not rotty!
* all cabinets are present (but see below)
* steering wheel has only one split in it

The bad parts:

* no title
* rocker under the double door is *toast*!
* bottom 3&quot; of the other side panel is no prize either :-(
* front floor looks dangerous
* sitting on the rims, so no look at the frame condition
* much delamination in the interior cabinets
* both windshield panes are smashed

Good Philosophical Bits:

* I get an excuse to start paying attention to the vintagebus list and
  reconnecting with all the volks I lost when we split (Craig, Clara,
  Thom, etc. :-(
* I get to own a bus from each generation
* I get a *SPLITTIE*!!!

Bad Philosophical bits:

* I can't store it.  Alexandria VA wants all vehicles to have tags, county
  sticker, and inspection sticker before it will stop putting &quot;love notes&quot;
  on the car.
* I already have two vans, and the '73 is in parlous condition and
  needing inspection as it is.
* The asking price ($500) is trivial compared to the &quot;on road&quot; price (I
  estimate close to $5K)
* I have tried this before (bought a '67 from Richard Palmer) and got
  caught in a bind and had to sell it :-(
* I am likely to be caught in the same bind again because my garage is
  going away.  My parents, having retired, are anxious to sell all their
  property in this area and that includes my garage (which is currently
  under contract to be sold).

Basically, this is a plea for help (THOM! Ban me from vintagebus so I can
get all pissed off and drop this silly idea!!! :-)  Not monetary help, but
rather commitment help.  There is no step in the process of bringing a bus
back that I have not either done or helped with.  I am walking wide-eyed
in this venture and it scares me.  It is not the individual steps, but
rather that there are a *lot* of steps!

The steps as I see it:

Stripping out.  I can do this.  I have done it before and figure 2-3 weeks
part-time.

Body work - Well, first, without a shop, I stand no chance of doing the
necessary body work myself.  It all has to be farmed out.  The frame
condition is unknown, the rockers are surely in bad, and the floors are
pretty toasty too.  I figure at least $2K and probably $3K for rust
removal.  Second, even if I had a shop, I have seen enough body work done
that I have this theory:  There are body people and there are mechanical
people and never the twain shall meet!  I am, frankly, a mechanical people
:-) If it works and the tolerances are within spec, I couldn't care less
what it looks like. Body people have concepts of both &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;time&quot;
that I just cannot understand :-)

Engine - The original engine is in the bus.  Rebuilt how many times?  I
dunno!  Rebuildable?  same answer.  I can certainly handle a standard
rebuild but I worry about restoration... with a bus of this vintage, I
would prefer restoration and a &quot;same year&quot; block would be nice :-) Am I
becoming a &quot;vintage pervert?  what do you mean &quot;becoming&quot;???

Other mechanicals... a mystery 'til I get a look under the bus.  As I said
above, there is nothing beyond my capabilities, tho there are some &quot;bits&quot;
(master cylinder, etc.) that have me a bit scared on availability.

Lastly, a couple questions...
I thought that the &quot;M-code&quot; plate was located behind the driver's seat...
looked and saw none.  saw no paint marks, tho that would have indicated
removal, nor rivet holes.

Replacement glass...  Problem?  are good used pieces available or are we
talking aftermarket-only at a reasonable price?

Other than the Master cylinder and turn signal box, what are the '67 only
parts?

I don't think this is the deluxe interior... bed/seat in the back and
seat/cooler cabinet behind the divider with a flip up table between.
&quot;Spice rack&quot; on the rear double door, tho.  What is it?  SO-wise?

I'll be on the chat server later on (irc.type2_dot_com, #buslist) If you wanna
talk about it.
