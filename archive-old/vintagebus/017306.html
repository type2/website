Subject: Carcover info needed (buscover)
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Ellis wants to buy another bus cover...

Longtime listees might remember back to the
&quot;type2_at_lenti&quot; days. There once was a source given for
factory second slight blem quality bus covers out of
California. I bought one and was extremely happy with
the purchase. My blem was that it was dusty on one
corner. Alas, I lost the source info and wish to
purchase another one. The source wasn't WolfsbWest,
RMMW, WCM or the regular &quot;value added marketeers&quot; this
was the real manufacturer.

Can anyone privately send the info to:
ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com.
Cross posting this question to the the Vanagon list
would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
