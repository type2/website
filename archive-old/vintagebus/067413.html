Some of the plants are using cooling water run through miles of ABS pipe in
wheat fields to extend the growing season into late fall and early spring.

The best solution is to build as many nukes as required to choke the arabs
into submission. The French did it. I believe I read that they get 70% of
their electric power from nukes. We should be able to do it too. No air
polution to boot. California's salvation is that over the last 15-20 years
the utilities have worked the bugs out of the few nukes we have and up time
has gone from sub-50% to over 95%. San Onofre and Diablo Canyon are really
big plants so that was a huge injection into the power grid. Save the spent
fuel so we can reuse it later in breeder reactors. Let's see if we can talk
Exxon into the nuke business.

We then could all afford to drive EV's.
