    I have been on the search for a 65 - 67 Westfalia PopTop camper for
about 6 months now.  If anyone on the list knows were one is, or has one
for sale, I would be interested.  I live in Indiana  and would be
interested within about a 2 state radius.  I am not looking for a show
winner. A  driver that needs some work is my ideal  find.

I would appreciate any leads.
 

Thanks
