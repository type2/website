Dear Folks,

Since the list folks (specifically Ken Hooper, many, many thanks to him!)
have been kind enough to donate some space on the Type 2 web page, it looks
like the bus tour will be getting back on track. From North Georgia the tour
is supposed to head into Alabama and from there go north into the Mid-west.

There is a small problem, though, as I have no clue as to who has the baton
and box with goodies or where it is. Will whoever has it now please e-mail
me at pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net or call me at (404) 351-3011 and let me know
you've got it. I will be happy to drive to get the sacred hubcap or will be
glad to pay postage/shipping to have it and the box of goodies sent to me
for the ceremony of resetting the sacred compass and getting it back on the
Great Highway (ought to be good for a great party!).

Will Greg Schmidt of Lanett, AL, Sami Daklia of Tuscaloosa, AL and Bill
McKinney of  Prattville, AL please e-mail or call me within the next week if
you are still interested in participating? Also, if any of you are in
Alabama, Middle Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, or Indiana and you would like
to drive, please let me know by e-mail and we will try to let everyone, who
wants to participate, drive this next part of the route.

To all others who would like to participate, please let me know soon so we
can set the route which is *entirely dependant* upon the location of people
wanting to drive. If not enough people sign up in one area there will be no
route through those states so don't be shy!  The details seem to work
themselves out the closer we get to any given leg so if you're remotely
interested please let me know and we'll do our best to see that all who want
to have a part in this get to do so.

For all those who have signed up and are listed on the remnants of Leo's web
page, please let me know if you're still interested. If I don't hear from
you, I will assume that you don't want to drive so let me know affirmatively
if you still want to play.

I will try to have some kind of informational page up and running in about
two weeks time (hope to goodness I will have most of this in paw by then)
and will post the address to the list then.

Thanks to all who have expressed an interest in this fun and spiritually
enriching experience! I will try to keep things moving and keep you all
informed.

Chris and Gus the &quot;Oh boy, we get to meet more neat people!&quot; Bus
