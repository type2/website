Not exactly vintage related, but pulley related. For hovercraft use where two
belts are needed, we have welded a second stock pulley with the center hub ct
out to a stock pulley. After balancing with a touch of arc weld here and there
we discovered that the heavier pulley acted as a vibration dampener and seemed
to add a quantity more hours to the engine. No empirical data, but of some
interest to those who are thinking of running a heavier pulley.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

  Almost every after market degree pully I have seen uses a 10 width belt
and after there are used up to an 11. Most of the aftermarket degree pulleys
have a different angle and width V groove in them. I have found that Gene
Bergs and SCATS are the best. EMPI, Bugpack and all the rags mag ad ones are
pure crap. Latest Rages heavy degree pully is awesome with the correct
groove and depth and also are balanced perfect
