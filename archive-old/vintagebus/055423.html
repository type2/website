&gt;&gt;Does anyone know how hard it would be to fit a split bus with the &quot;European&quot; SO-69 Westfalia kit&lt;&lt; 

I put a Westy interior from a '75 into a '66 and here's what I discovered: 1) The rear hatch area cabinets are about 4-5 inches taller on the bay window, cutting of cabinets is required.  2)The split is about 3-4 inches wider inside, leaving a small gap between seat and wall.  3)The contour of the wall where it meets the roofline is a little different angle or arc, leaving a little bit of a gap between the cabinets and wall toward the top of the cabinet.  Other than these issues. it actually came out pretty decent, as long as you're not hung up on being &quot;perfect&quot;.  BTW, I have since installed the correct vintage SO-33 interior into this '66 and it does look better;^)
