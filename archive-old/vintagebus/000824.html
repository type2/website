Hi Howard!

I have a front bumper and I think that I might have a back one too the front 
they would both be off an early 60's (60 to 61 or so) I don't know if they 
will fit your or not but you can have them if you like Make me an offer. I 
also have some taillight assembly's they are off a 65 I don't know if they 
would fit either but the same thing make me an offer.

If you are in a real hurry I am travelling about 1600km away from my home 
visiting my Mom it is freezing up here!  god thing I got              some 
good heat. just reflectix insulated the whole van yesterday and sealed up the 
doors all around to keep the wind out.  nice and toasty now and more quiet. I 
was wondering also if any one knew how to noise proof the engine comp?

anywise i will be back in about a week or so if you can wait that long.

let me know.
