Lets think about this before we go off half cocked.  This club must have 
been called on the carpet for the things which did go on last year and they 
are attempting to respond to these events to keep the show, and Vintage VWs 
there.  They put it well.. if you want a different type of shoe organize 
one.  If you had a barbeque and people trashed your house and yard how would 
you feel?  No flame... try their their shoes on.  The alternative, no shows, 
or strictly corporate affairs might not be desirable... after the thread on 
the &quot;new bus&quot; we should keep a solid front.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As has been discussed in this newsgroup a couple weeks ago, there
&gt;
&gt; &gt;are some major changes to the show, including:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - No modified show classes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - Show cars only will be allowed to enter the park.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - All show cars must park with their class.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - All show cars must remain parked until after 3pm.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - No fires or BBQ's.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - No Alcohol.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;    - No pets.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
