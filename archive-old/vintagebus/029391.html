Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?
References: &lt;01d201c01f2b$4e6d13c0$660110ac_at_0017429058&gt; &lt;39C2F508.4A7FB32C_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

My garage is dark with lots of spiders living in a few milkcrates full of junk I
never look at. The floor is clean, but there's lots of dust along the walls from
the wood slats that are not air tight and grass grows in the corners (same reason,
woodslats). I have an attic too with more spiders, I just leave them alone cause I
don't want to put anything up there anyway. Did I mention it floods in the rainy
season.

On one side is the only running Type 3 Ghia with a working factory electric sunroof
in California and on the other side is a soon to be, beautifully restored 57 23
window Deluxe. The parts to put it back together are in the house where it is clean
and dry. Looks like I'll need to do some work on the garage.
