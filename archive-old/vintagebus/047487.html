&gt; Just got back from Walmart 

I too got a few of these things.  One for me, one for my bodyshop lady (my 
'62 panel is in for new paint - cool!), and one donated to the club for the 
next cruise raffle.

Nobody has mentioned that the scales are different for the two vehicles, so 
the bug is too big in relation to the bus (1:24 &amp; 1:25).

Doesn't seem like much of a difference, but it does look a little weird.
