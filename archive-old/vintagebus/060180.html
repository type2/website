Beter luck with &quot; just ask Jeeves &quot; for compatibility regarding mismatched product.
Nobody with integrity will tell you to do that. The use of a non-spec primer with
mismatched reducer is an unknown at best.
The alternative is to apply the unknown material and make three wishes.
As for applying topcoat over old material, your supplier will suggest an array
of sealers, both to secure the substrate, and to provide a secure base for the color.
Then wait five years for the problems to surface.( delamination, color fade, etc. )
The PPG website includes a paint defects chart.

&gt;You need to ask the people that will sell you the Valu-Pro paint these questions.
&gt;
&gt;****************************************************************************************************
&gt;
&gt;My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?  I have some CIL acrylic enamel primer surfacer that I
&gt;plan on using.  I had that around for a while but I don't have the reducer for it.  Should my
&gt;valu-pro reducer work for that CIL stuff as well - both are acrylic enamel. The valu-pro paint is
&gt;ICI or PPG?  This stuff is Acrylic Enamel and I hear that is a very good choice for someone who has
&gt;never painted before.
