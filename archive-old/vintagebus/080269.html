Subject: Re: [BSKA] Toe-in Adjust (Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!)

Hi Gene -

Don't know if this has been suggested to you yet, but I had very similar 
issues with my single cab after installing 15&quot; wheels at the rear with 
larger tires, while leaving the 14&quot; wheels on the front until they wear out.

This change in attitude, made the steering feel unsafe at any speed with 
sudden darting about.

The cure in this case was a careful front wheel bearing adjustment - making 
sure to snug them up to spec.  This essentially resolved the problem.

Nick
