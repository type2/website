&lt;&lt; Not that it really matters, I'm still looking at having to pull the engine

Hi Zac,
Whoa, stop the presses!  First get out the Idiot's manual by John Muir and
read on how to drive without a clutch.  Yes, you could just tow it, but this
is the best time to learn so you do not have to later abandon your bus
sometime just because the clutch goes.  Barb was driving Nermal (1960 panel
camper conversion.) to the MGM studios in Los Angelos right on the highway in
rush hour traffic and learned the hard way of how to do without a clutch.
She did fine with me coaching her and we made the ten miles to the studios
with no problem.

&lt;&lt; I'm getting to the point slowly.  After fighting to maintain a positive
attitude I figured I might as well fix or maintain whatever else I can while
the engines out.  That is whatever is significantly easier to fix once the
engines out anyway. And that's pretty much my question. I haven't had the
engine out of this one yet so is there anything I should be doing or looking
for while I'm down there? Wiring, fuel lines, anything like that. &gt;&gt;
Good idea, you might want to strip the engine to the long block stage, and
torque all of the case and head nuts and bolts to proper torque values.  Then
clean out all of the cooling fins of any junk or casting flash in them.  It
is amazing what gets through the cooling fan and gets stuck in there.  Plus
how often the head fins are clogged with casting flash.   Install a doghouse
cooling system if it is a fresh air 40 HP or later engine.  Repair or install
the thermostatic bellows and flaps system.  Clean and make sure all cooling
tin is complete, in good condition and fits proper to the other tin on the
engine.  Make sure to replace all flex fuel lines if more than two or three
years old (Or who knows when?).  Check metal fuel line and make sure that
where it goes throught the forward tin that the grommet is in place or
replace missing grommet with a 2-3&quot; section of slit fuel line slid into place
through the hole and hose clamped onto the metal fuel line to prevent having
the metal fuel line getting cut through from vibration and rubbing.  Of
course clean everthing and inspect for wear and repair or replace if needed.
