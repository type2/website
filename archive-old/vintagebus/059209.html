&gt;Well, this evening I went about doing all that.  First, I pulled the
&gt;upper drivers side torsion arm.  Replaced with unit from bus boys,
&gt;and checked the alignment.  Still 5.0 mm, so I then assumed that it
&gt;must be the bottom arm that is bent.  Remove sway bar, undo lower
&gt;shock bolt, and pull off lower torsion arm and replace.  Measure
&gt;again, and I'm at 5.3 mm.  WTF?

From the example on page V-5 3, you could theoretically round 5.3
up to 5.5 and go with it.  (They round 8.3 to 8.5).

Did you compare the new arms from Bus Boys with the ones that were
on your Bus?  If the part number is cast in, is it the same part
number?  Do they look like the same parts?  (Tip: Label the torsion
arms - existing vs new - because you _will_ forget :) ).

Have you tried flopping the passenger side arms over to the driver's
side to see what the offset is that way?  If it moves to 7 mm you
can probably suspect some bent arms; if it also goes to 5.3 then
you can probably suspect the beam.

Are you sure that both torsion arms are seating all the way down
over the leaves?  Like, there isn't a leaf sticking out a couple
of mm on the driver's side or something, and there isn't lots of
old crappy grease in the torsion arms etc. 

Just some thoughts and ideas.  Good luck!
