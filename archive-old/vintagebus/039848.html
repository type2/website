Hey Rex,

This is how I was told to time w/ a light and it works for me.  Look for the 
notch in your crank pulley this is top dead center.  Make a dot w/ paint so 
its more visiable.  Measure 28-30 degrees after top (to the right of the 
notch) dead center, this will be for your advance.  Take your dizzy cap off 
and look for the notch in the rim of the canister.  Turn your engine by hand 
untill the rotor button points at the notch (#1) and the crank pulley is 
closest to the vertical crack in the case.  Hook up the pos/neg from the 
timing light to the battery and put the clip on the #1 plug wire and start 
him up.  Make sure you have already loosened the 10mm nut on the dizzy 
clamp.  Rev him up and make sure the advance mark goes to the case split.  
It may not idle exactly at TDC but make sure it does advance completely at 
2500-300 RPM.  There may be some errors in this but my bus likes it!  Hop it 
helps!

&gt;
&gt;Wanted to ask again how to time at full advance. I've read the archives and
&gt;see that I need a timing analyzer. I take it I can't do it with a standard
&gt;strobe light. Is this correct?
&gt;
&gt;I've got a vacume advance disty and a 34 PICT carb.
&gt;
&gt;So do I rev the engine to 3000 RPMS and time at 28-30 BTDC ? How do I
&gt;figure out where on the pulley that 28-30 mark is?
&gt;
&gt;Since I've got a '75 FI case, with a 34 PICT carb, and a vacume advance
&gt;disty from a 60's model vehicle (can't seem to figure out what it actually
&gt;is) , I'm just not sure where to time at idle.  So I figure the best
&gt;solution is to time at full advance and let it be where it's gonna be. Does
&gt;this sound right?
&gt;
&gt;A nice to the point and simple explanation of the procedure would help
&gt;tremendously. As well as what I need to look for in a timing analyzer (if I
&gt;need on that is). I've read enough of &quot;how disty's work&quot; in the archives.
&gt;So I'm not really looking for a discussion (or debate) on that. Thanks for
&gt;the help.
