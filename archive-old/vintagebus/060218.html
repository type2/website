Subject: 40 hp cylinders????

So thanks to all who have provided info and offers to help - I'm still =
trying to figure out what I need.  The PO told me that my 40 hp engine =
had a big bore kit - hmmm - I now suspect he was wrong.  I measured the =
inside diameter of my pistons and they seem to be 77 mm (the outside =
diameter is 90 mm but I guess that is irrelevant.)  Anyway,  could these =
be pistons from a 1300 cc motor installed in a 1200 cc motor with 1200 =
cc heads?  I think I measured the stoke and I get 65 mm - but that can't =
be right - I guess I measured incorrectly and the stroke is actually 64 =
mm and that makes my engine 1200 - but I would like to be sure that =
these are not 1300 cc cylinders.

Anyone around Ontario have a set of 113 101 373 reconditioned heads they =
wanna sell.  Of 371 A, B, C, D, or F reconditioned heads with short =
studs that they wanna sell. =20

TIA
