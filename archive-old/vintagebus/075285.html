Subject: Re: [VB] PLF highroof accident

In 1995 on my way home from work I was driving my '67 kombi when at 40+ mph
I had a Nissan Sentra mak a left in front of me and I was in the
intersection. I had no time to hit the brakes and only enough time to jerk
the wheel to keep from t-boning. It did tuck the front drivers side bumper
(all sheet metal too) behind the front tire. Totaled the Nissan and totaled
my Kombi.  I suffered a broken toe, bruised ribs (from the door handle) and
a cut on the bridge of my nose (from sun glasses when my head hit the door.
I walked away and the driver of the Nissan.... ambo ride for her.

It is like I tell my daughter about flying on a plane.... when it is your
time to go and God calls you, your gone and nothing you do can stop that. So
go on that plane, drive your bus because fearing them, you are going to miss
out on the fun and adventure. And it won't shorten your life 1 second less
than the time you have been alloted to be here on earth.
