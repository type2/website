Subject: 62 parts needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,I went out and did an assesment of teh things i
needed for the single cab. I need the following for a
1962 specificly.

-Driver and passenger side doglegs NOS or cut from
another bus 
-singlecab rockers, both sides,
-rear apron
-driverside door, Must have good hinges and be rot
free
-engine lid
- mirrors with arms , prefer &quot;elephant ears&quot; 
- 15 inch bus rims ,all 5
- lower part of the rear corners

I saw that the repro doglegs are for 63-67 . is there
any wat to make these fit like 62 and earlier? 

How hard is it to modify the bus rocker to fit a
single caB? can I just switch the lock base thats on
the rocker itself?

Is the lower part of the rear corners the same as the
truck ? All I nees is a little below the tail lights
around the battery pan area.

Thanks
---Bryan
