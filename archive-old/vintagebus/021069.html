&gt; The first adjustment was the 009 dizzy. The timing
&gt; was about 28 max advance
&gt; degrees but seemed to advance slowly. I thought this
&gt; was a normal 009 thing
&gt; as I always have a flat spot with these dizzys.  We
&gt; took it apart and found
&gt; only one return spring. Is this normal? It looks
&gt; like there is a place for
&gt; two springs, but it appears to only have one from
&gt; the factory. 

I don't know about the rest of your problems (I'm
running a little too hot also), but I can tell you
that the 009 does only have one advance return spring.
 I had the same question you did, and found that there
was only one to start with.
