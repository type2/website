Subject: Re: [VB] re: windshield leak

On most years (US spec) everything but the windsheilds is tempered sekurit.   
You can safely kick , pry or pop it out.   If you have tempered sekurit 
windsheilds ditto, and reuse the seals.  You can kick the back window out of your 
friends bug to put long boxes in it when you went to costco and he decided he 
needed one of those shelters to put a bus under, and a bunch of other stuff, 
and you get back to the car and go ... hm, hows this going to fit?

 The many nail trick might do it w/ laminated, I guess he can bet the glass 
on it and tell us how it goes.   

   which kind was yours,  tempered or laminated?

No need to cut your seals to remove windows. When my cargo door glass was
broken out I watched the guy at the glass shop pull my other cargo glass to
get a template. He took alot of little tack nails and pushed them under the
inside seal until the got above the glass. Then he lifted up on the nail and
pushed it into the rubber slightly. He used about 20 nails about an inch 
apartand finally had the seal lifted away from the glass on one corner. Then he
patted firmly on that corner of the glass and it moved past the rest of the
seal. I have new seals which is a bonus, old seals might not like this
treatment.  I have done this method to remove all my stationary glass and
POR-15 the channels, then put the glass back using the wire/Windex method.
