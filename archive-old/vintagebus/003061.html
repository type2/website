Subject: Re: what kind of side windows are these.

&gt;I'm looking at purchasing this '62 and I was wondering what kind of side
&gt;windows these are ( they have cranks on the inside of the bus ) and if the
&gt;stipping is still available or if I can convert them back to the fixed
style
&gt;of side windows.
&gt;Thanks, Dan

They're Sundial or another American style of camper conversion. I have seen
them and the parts for them in RV shops within the last few years, they are
right off the shelf. No, you cannot convert them back to fixed because there
were never any windows there. Those kind are mounted in a hole sawed in the
side. American camper conversions were most commonly made out of the less
expensive panel vans. See Josh's camper pages in the reference section of
the type 2 home page.
