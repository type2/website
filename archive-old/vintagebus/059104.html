Hey List,

             I have had quite a few people inquire about the safari's.  T=
he only reason I am selling them is I have a third child on the way and I=
 need the money.  I went ahead and put them up on e-bay even though I thi=
nk the hole e-bay thing is a hassle.   I had a guy bid on a bus I was sel=
ling recently  only to flake out.  I put them up for $200 even though som=
eone already offered 400 for them.  Good luck and I hope they go to a goo=
d home.

Thanks =20
