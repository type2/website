&gt;anyway this one had the brown paper stuff strewn all over the inside.
&gt;it appears that one of the capacitors exploded. well something labeled
&gt;C2 on the circuit board, and labeled T1, 4 7 0 MFD, 16 VDC85degC, 7640,
&gt;then an arrow pointing away from a neg sign. I am not sure if this is
&gt;a capacitor or not.

Yep, that's a capacitor.  470 microfarad, 16 volt, 85 degrees C, made
in the 40th week of 1976.  Spewing guts like that is a fairly typical
failure mode for electrolytic capacitors, which is what that is.  The
arrow is pointing to one of the leads on the bottom of the capacitor
to tell you it's the negative one - most electrolytic capacitors have
to be hooked up with the right polarity.

&gt;what is the likely hood of finding another capacitor like this?

Would you believe Radio Shack?  That's one of the parts they still
sell.  Either a 272-957 (470 uF, 16 V) or 272-1030 (470 uF, 35 V)
will work, and either should be about $1.

Since caps do dry out with time, changing out the blown cap may just
fix it.  If it does, replace the other capacitor in there too.

&gt;this is Archer voltage inverter catalog number 22-129A.
&gt;this is archer voltage inverter, catalog number 22-129B.

You have exactly the same two converters I have.  On the 22-129B, the
black wire is 6 V in, the red wire is 12 V out, and the green wire is
ground.  On mine, there is an inline fuse holder on the black wire.

&gt;the black and green appear to attach to wires which in turn attach to
&gt;this donut shaped coil of red green and copper wires.

That's the transformer.  The two flat black plastic things with metal
tabs (129B) or metal buttons with an oval flange (129A) bolted to the
aluminum case are the transistors.  There should be some resistors -
little beads with colored stripes on them - too.

&gt;I think i need inline fuses somewhere, but i am not sure where.

Put one on the input to the converter - the black wire on the 129B
converter.  The radio will have its own fuse.

&gt;also i was thinking of putting the radio some what remotely from the
&gt;fuse box, would this cause potential problems?

Not really.  If you can, put the converter near the fuse box.  That
way there will be less voltage drop on the 6 V feed wire to the
converter.

Your radio will probably have a &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;battery&quot; power wire and a
&quot;main&quot; or &quot;ignition&quot; power wire.  If it has a &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;battery&quot;
power wire, you'll need to wire the converter to the battery (i.e.,
not switched) and connect both power wires from the radio to the
converter output.  If it doesn't have a &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;battery&quot; power
wire, you can use a toggle switch in the input wire to the converter
if you like.

&gt;if i hang it under the parcel tray-i think it would be difficult to
&gt;secure it well without it getting in the way of the shifter, or in
&gt;the way of knees.

I have seen people install them on top of the parcel shelf, between the
dash and the official radio hole.  I think they drill holes in the parcel
shelf to do this, though.
