Well I don't know if you remember but I pulled my radio, and had it all packed
up to be sent off to this guy Brad who I had heard good things about.

Unfortunately he just shut down for the summer, I guess he is trying to catch
up to a backlog. 

Anyone else out there to fix an old radio? I had heard it would be possible to
have them fixed at a show, so I am on the lookout for a show.
