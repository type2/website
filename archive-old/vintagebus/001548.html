Subject: Sunroof Threaded Sleeves

Hi, We're wondering if anyone who has done a sunroof has found a source for,
or found something that works as a replacement for the threaded sleeves that
hold the ends of the sunroof bows together. About half of ours broke as we
were trying to get them apart. Your thoughts on this are appreciated. Chris
