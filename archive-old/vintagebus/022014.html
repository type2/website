Subject: Does anyone have a good used or new choke cable?
Message-ID: &lt;2d0ef16c.246d9fd0_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks,
We are looking for a 1955-61 choke cable including it's tubing for our 1960
panel camper.  We have found a ZVW accessory kit for converting the 40HP
engine to manual choke.  Since the 1641cc engine uses a simular style
caburator we want to see if we can make the kit work with this setup.
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
