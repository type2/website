Subject: Obscure Reduction Gearbox Leak

I managed to convince my local NAPA in Ardmore Pa. that they could get
Sta-Lube GL-4 gear oil (I had to convince them that &quot;GL4/GL5&quot; oil is not the
same thing, and then look it up for them in their catalog -- CRC Corp. is
the parent company, by the way) and they ordered it. Got into removing the
fill and drain sockets and found my transmission oil level was low. Couldn't
feel it with my finger in the side fill opening. So I drained and refilled
everything.

The next night I spied a very small puddle just inside the left rear tire.
Turned out the oil was seeping out gradually where the front edge of the
reduction gearbox meets the spring plate. There was no leakage at the axle
or at the seam between the RGB halves. From the manuals, I concluded that
the big round metal assembly plug on the inner side of the RGB might be
leaking, so I tore into everything, and that appears to be the case. I don't
want to get deeply into playing with the metal plug, so my plan is to clean
the area well and cover the plug (and a bit beyond its diameter) with some
RTV silicone gasket-maker and rebolt the box to the spring plate, hopefully
sealing it.

Any other ideas? By the way, anyone have two magnetic drain plugs I can put
on the RGBs?
