&lt;&lt; Car companies have been hugely successful at duping the American car

100k  miles the car is junk. Ludicrous! &gt;&gt;

Not to stray to far from bus content but I also have h20 vw's...drive them in 
inclement weather and when the salt is on the road so the Binz and the Panel 
stay (relatively) solid...anyway, when buying a H20 VW I make a point not to 
look at anything with under 100K miles when I buy one.  Many folks have 
bought in to the myth a car with 100K miles is worthless.  I love it!!  You 
can pick up a good Jetta or Golf for around $2K that will last you another 
80K - 100K with minimal problems.  Beats the hell out of $20K for a new 
one...and you can put all the $$$ you save into your bus!  8-)
