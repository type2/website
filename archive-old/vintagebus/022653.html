Subject: [VB] Decoding years - the fine line...

I'm trying to figger out if my panel is a '59 or a '60.

My chassis # is 533736

One source of Numbers, on which I based the Registry tables, says Nov '59,
1959 Model year.  The M-tag agrees somewhat with a build date of 11/11/59.
The Neato Guide isn't much more specific.

I guess what I'm trying to get at, is do I call this a 1960 model or a 1959
model?  I'm trying really hard to avoid the stigma of owning a 60's bus...

BTW, the VintageBus_dot_com Registry is up to 928 entries, and I'm really close
to having all of the color decoding figured out.
