&quot;My first experience with Safari type windshields was with a Model A
Ford!!!&quot;


My first experience with the crank-out front windshield was a 39 Chevy Pick-up I
drove it on an off up till a few years ago, it had repop seals and it didn't
leak at all. I've never owned a VW that didn't leak. Its why the engineers added
the built in towel bar on all models (I mean grab bar)
