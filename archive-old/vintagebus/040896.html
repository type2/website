Thanks, you can't argue with the numbers.  But a previous question now
resurfaces from early December-See below.   No numbers on this one.  It's
long enough to clear most any bumper but doesn't fit the crank start nut. It
was determined to be an industrial engine crank also.  Were there different
industrial cranks?

&quot; I have a '56 bus, which came with a crank start handle. The handle is
different from others I have seen. The end of the handle that engages the
crank start nut has a smaller diameter shaft about 1 1/4 inches long beyond
the crosspiece. It appears that this extension might be spring loaded, i.e.
slides back into the main crank handle. &quot;
