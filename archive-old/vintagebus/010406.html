I prefer my block-off plate.

Who needs music when you have the melodic tones of your valve
train in harmony with the whistle of air through the closed safari
windows.  Not to mention the baseline hum from the reduction
boxes when your purring down the freeway.

There is no better music to the ear than a fine running bus.
