&gt;  More slats would help when setting down a beer

    ARE WE TALKING GERMAN BEER?

&gt; My 3 year old slats are gray and warped, I used indoor
&gt; urethane instead of marine varnish/urethane and it's
&gt; pretty much all gone. The truck is always parked outside
&gt; too. I can sand 'em down to the pretty wood and varnish
&gt; again, but...

The slat dilemma is a dammed if you do dammed if you don't situation!
In order to have the slats resist chipping/dents/etc. they need to be a hard
wood.  Unfortunately most hardwoods do not weather well outside except for
teak &amp; other exotic hardwoods which are not very sustainable woods or
inexpensive. If you use a wood that is resistant to the weather like
Redwood, Alaskan Yellow Cedar, Cypress, etc. they are not very hard, or
politically correct!
Back in the days when VW was making slats, white oak was very inexpensive
but hard so they probably used it because it could be cheaply replaced when
the finish/wood wore out after a couple of years.  Little did they know that
some geeks would be trying to keep it pristine and able to set their beer on
it 30-50 years later!!!

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has considered synthetic slats
&gt; as in the new decking material made from recylcled
&gt; plastic? 
   &quot;Trex&quot; is probably the best brand name for this material.  I have
specified tons of it for projects, but never in the thin profiles that the
slats are made to. Not sure how it will mill as it is made of a composite of
recycled plastic grocery bags and wood fibers!

I just looked at a Google search for recycled
&gt; decking and found a bunch of sources. There's a few
&gt; choices of color and uses the same tools and fasteners
&gt; as wood.
    Yes you can cut it/drill it like wood, but it dulls the hell out of your
tools, so I'd be careful when I took an expensive shaper or router blade to
it to make the correct profile?

 Guess I could get dimensions and have some
&gt; milled. Anybody interested in a set?

I'd be interested in the experiment, especially if you could create spaces
to hold your beer in place.

P.S. One way to protect your slats from weathering is to keep them under an
easily replaceable tilt canopy where they aren't exposed to the weather.
