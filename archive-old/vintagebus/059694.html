Subject: Overriders - Not Overriders

What is the deal with overriders on DC's and SC's?

I've seen pictures of &quot;unrestored&quot; and &quot;original&quot; trucks, some have
overriders front and back, some have them on front and not on back, etc,
etc.

Were they originally sold with an overrider as an option?
