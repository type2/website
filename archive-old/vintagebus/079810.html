Subject: Info on Split Bus dash cut-out for radio needed

Haven't picked up my bus yet, but I'm looking for a radio on eBay and
TheSamba. I need to know the distance between the center of the shaft
holes, and the size of the rectangular cut-out for the face of the
radio. Does the bus use a different faceplate than sedans use, maybe
curved a bit? In general will radios for any given year fit various
models of VWs, or were the radios specific for each model?

Thanks in advance,
