Hey, I just got a new toy!!
Unfortionatly, i need to complete mine.
I need to locate a single &quot;cyclone&quot; air cleaner.
Ill take a nice pair if I can find them.
I also need to locate the &quot;fuel filter&quot; you can see in the picture.
Im wondering if it has other aplications outside of this kit.
Perhaps a porsche one would be similar? Thom? Ronnie? Any suggestions?
My kit is missing the fuel line and one cyclone.
And help is apreciated.
Please feel free to forward this to any Vintage lists, or 356 lists or 
whatever.
Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
Regards, Greg Noble
