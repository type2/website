Subject: Re: [VB] are the keys the same?

The 67 bus came with one key for doors and ignition.   barndoors had separate 
keys for doors than ignition, and so did buses with steering locks through 
66.  non steeringlock buses 55-66 had one key for ig and doors.  when new.

Whether that is still the case depends on whether any handles have been 
replaced.   the 67 cargo door handle is notoriously subject to breaking, as the key 
is longer, making the handle weaker, so often gets replaced.  In fact, 99% of 
buses missing the cargo door handle are 67s, use this trick to amaze your 
friends with your year identification skills!

also, if the ignition was replaced,  they do wear out occasionally, it would 
take a differnt key.

So to check, remove handles, and look for code.  a 67 code would be ##L###, 
such as 20L123.  If the code says T####, such as T1111, the handel is from a 
54-66 bus.
There is yet another key for 54-63 buses, and the doors of 53 and earlier 
buses used yet another style key.   SO if you have a couple differnt L locks, you 
can get them rekeyed to fit one key, but a T or other series lock wont work 
with a L key, nor can you fit the key tumbler into a L handle.

The code is on the square shaft (usually) of the cargo door handle, on the 
thingy that screws to the end of the cylinder (usually, but maybe not on 67s, 
but on the inside of the handle somewhere) of the front door handles (must pull 
panels back and use small allen to remove the handle) and on the ig switch 
base (must remove ig switch to see).   

a good locksmith will be able to cut keys to code.   Check your local 
phonebook
