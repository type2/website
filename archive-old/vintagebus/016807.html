Hi- On my 61 standard bus I was going to replace the shift rod guide
bushing (or sleeve).  When I tried to undo the coupler with the two
square headed screws, one of the square heads was broken off, I guess by
a PO.  After struggling to loosen the other square headed screw I had the
great pleasure of breaking it off as well.  (It was a team effort between
me and the PO =o).  So my question is, where do I go from here?  Is there
some way to get the broken pieces of screw out or have they permanently
welded themselves to the shift rod?  Thanks for any help you can offer.
