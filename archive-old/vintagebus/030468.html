My buses are:

53 LHD LHDoor grey Swedish panel, in restored condition but has some
rust coming through again. Will eventually address that but having fun
for now.

56 DD panel, dove blue in very complete OG condition with ambulance fan
option. Daily junk runner for now. Very straight and little rust.

58 23 window SWR/CB in full resto process. Body to be done in a couple
of months. Will need a slew of good parts to make this one complete but
I have the majority already.

... Also have owned...

54 Single Cab dove blue surface rust only.
60 DD panel grey, very rusty underneath but made a drive from Colo. to LA
67 hardtop deluxe velvet green and white. no rust very straight but
funky wheelwell cuts.
