Hi,
My son and I will be going to Germany in June for Bad Camberg,we have a few
weeks to take in all the rest  of the country and would like to do it in a
VW Camper if possible.
My question is :Does ANYONE have any info for European Rentals of Westys ??
ANY and all info would be very much appreciated !!
Hopefully we can get one secured for the trip,I believe it will be just that
much more enjoyable....
Thnak you in advance for your help !!
