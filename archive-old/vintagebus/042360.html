&gt;  Hi Steve,
&gt; 614455 would have been built at the end of MAY60 which would have been about 
&gt; 3/4 the way through the 60 model year.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;In the archives i found that low hinge doors started mid-late 61 at chassis 
&gt; # 705619.&gt;&gt;
&gt; That would have been built DEC60 which would have been almost 1/2 way through 
&gt; the 61 model year.
&gt;  
&gt; &lt;&lt;So does that mean all 61's with low hinge doors have gas gagues, or that 
&gt; they all have a one year only reserve tap cable?(if indeed the gague became 
&gt; standard in 62....)  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Just because the cargo door upper hindges got lower did not lengthen the bus. 
&gt;  Since the fuel reserve cable runs under the bus it probably did not change 
&gt; due to this hindge change.  According to our parts manual the only three 
&gt; changes in length was wether it was a truck or a kombi/micro or a walkthru.
&gt;   The fuel gauge was standard 31JULY61 in chassi # 802 986.

hello,

i guess my confusion was this, why does wolfsburg west only list a fuel
reserve tap cable up to chassis built in late 60, but the fuel gague
doesnt become standard until a year later?  Either there is a one year
only fuel tap cable or WW dropped the ball??

thanks,

Steve

p.s. i didnt think the hinging of the doors had anything to do with the
gas gague or reserve cable, im just looking to buy a low hinge 61 and
trying to figure out if it likely has a gas gague or not, and if it
doesnt, wether or not the tap cable is one year only.
