As we all know the internet is full of wierdos and con-men. When I built my
truck site www.dropgates_dot_com , I was lookin for information on &quot;Randy's
woodslats&quot;, I emailed him and the email address didnt work. So I put an add
out askin for anyone who was makin them, so I could have a contact person to
put on the site to buy from. Well I received an email from Bryan Cook of CA
stating that he was basically in charge of Randy's business now, and Randy
was too old and grouchy to really make the sets anymore. So I should put all
Bryan's info as the contact info including &quot;make all checks payable to
B.cook&quot;... A few weeks of correspondence went back and forth between me and
Bryan about what to charge and what options I thought people would want and
etc. He would tell me &quot; oh lemme ask Randy about that, ill get back to you&quot;
etc.When in reality he wasn't even discussing it with Randy.
A few days ago Randy happened to be surfin the net when he came upon my site
and went into the Bed slat area........
Shortly after, I get an email askin WTF is goin on and why do I have someone
elses name for his business!
Turns out Bryan was a friend of Randy's, and was doin this in secret without
Randy's knowledge. He's been tellin Randy &quot;hey i know of a couple of more
people who wants slats..make me up a few more sets&quot; etc etc.
To make a long story short, Randy is still the Bed slat king and is still
the owner/runner/maker etc, so I have updated the info on the site. Randy is
a good guy with a great rep that makes a killer product. Bad vibes go out to
Bryan Cook the loser con-man
