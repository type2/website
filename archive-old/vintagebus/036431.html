Subject: Update on 63 singlecab, Bedslats &amp; Radio

This is the link to my new page, I apologize about the banners and will do 
something to fix that soon.
I had help from Roger Nang &amp; got in the truck bedslats that I bought a long 
time ago.
They were rivets in with closed end pop rivets, not too easy to find but they 
do exist. We will see how much it leaks in the rain.
There are also pictures of the radio installation, Clara's engine compartment 
light, and a run to the dump using it as a real working truck.
I guess that it will never be a show truck, but I am mighty proud of it.
