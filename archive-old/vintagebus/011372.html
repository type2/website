&gt; I have heard that there is a auto insurance policy available called an &quot;agreed
&gt; to value&quot; or something like that.  Basically you and the insurance company
&gt; decide on the value of the vehicle when it is insured.  I believe this is
&gt; mainly for antiques.  Seems like a good thing, especially for folks with
&gt; emotional / sentimental attachments inanimate objects, not that I would know
&gt; any ;-)

AAA doesn't offer that.  The flip side of those policies is the 
list of restrictions on what you can and can't do with the car.
