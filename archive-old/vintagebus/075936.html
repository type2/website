&gt; Hello Eric&amp;Barb
&gt; 
&gt;   I have a couple of tumblers in front of me right now. I have a 67 key with 
&gt; a v78g number that works in the ignition but it is not the right one. I am 
&gt; going to buy a new $20 ignition switch but how do I find out what type 
&gt; tumblers I have. I know all are 64-66 but the 65 tumblers seem not to fit a key I do 
&gt; have that is a V2. One of my spare tumblers works with this key but they 
&gt; don't have any markings on them from what I can see.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; Eric

Hi Eric,
The keys you mention are aftermarket keys so do not have the stock VW letter 
code on them.  Do you have a key manufacture embossed on them?  The 1967 and 
later keys are cut on two side where the pre-1967 keys are only cut on one 
edge.  You mention that you have some tumblers, but do not mention having handles. 
 The handles will have the Letter and numeral code stamped into them.  You 
need to find this stamping on the handles to find out what key series you have 
and thusly you can fit an aftermarket key to the tumbler.  Unless of course the 
tumber is so worn out that one could stick in a popsicle stick!  BTDT.....
