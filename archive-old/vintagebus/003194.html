Here, here!

Find the same enjoyment, though I use my pride and joy for the 2 miles or so
to work, so I get hit with the uplifting power when I walk out of my office
and see Gretchen, sitting there smiling, begging to have her safari's opened
for the 5 minute cruise home.  Ah, to drive comfortably as everyone else
during rush hour expresses their rage, to smile and wave.  To wait for
people to cross the street.  To stop for a yellow light.  Ah.  The stress
wittles away.
