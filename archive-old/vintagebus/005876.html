Tonight I was working on the bus a little bit when stark reality hit home.
My bus looks like crap.

I've been working hard on a daily basis on my VWs since 1993.  I never have
really considered any of my work on my VWs a restoration because it never
has been.  A true restoration with a bug involves a pan-off and with a bus,
you really should strip the shell and go over it completely such as Thom
Fitzpatrick does.  So I end up with good running VWs but under the surface
they are rusting away.  Really then, what good is my mechanical work, if I
don't thoroughly go through a vehicle completely and restore it?

I piddled around tonight and realized that this bus really deserves to be
stripped down and done right.  It's solid for a Midwest bus but it's got the
rocker rust and holes behind the front wheels.  I also attempted to work on
one of the popouts in the forward cargo door and stripped out a screw head
so I just put all the screws back in and called it a night.  I actually sat
there in the shop in the chair - totally disgusted with myself for whatever
reason.  I realized that I can do the mechanical work on a vehicle well but
other than that, I really don't have good restoration skills.  I don't know
how to do body work nor can I afford it.  I actually started thinking of how
much money I have tied up in this bus and just how cheaply I could afford to
sell it.  I simply think I spread my resources too thin.  I've got a rusted
out battery tray in Li'l Red, my 74 Super Beetle, that has needed to be
replaced for 3 years and I've never got around to welding in a replacement.
I've got a nasty oil leak due to bad pushrod tubes and shot tranny mounts
that I've sworn off now for over 2 years on Li'l Red.  Even though it's a
Super Beater, Li'l Red deserves more attention.

I visited with Mike Carroll in Omaha this past weekend.  He's a great guy
and has 2 of the most coolest looking dubs you'll ever see.  One is his
daily driver - a dropped yellow beetle with dual carbs.  Everything about
that bug is just simply sweet.  I realize that I want a nice looking daily
driver VW.  After 15 straight months of centering my life around a bus to
drive, I'm tickled pink to have actually driven one.  They aren't speed
demons or performance vehicles but it's one of the coolest rides you'll ever
drive.

It's kind of dumb to be thinking about selling off this bus as I've worked
really darn hard to put it on the road but it really irks me to look at it.
I see all the flaws such as the torn headliner, the rust spots, the dents,
the scrapes and it dawns on me - I don't know how to fix it.  I just don't
know how to keep my bus from rusting away without making it look like crap
with a pile of POR15 all over.

I fix VWs but I can't restore them because I don't know how.

Before I take such a drastic step, I discussed things with mom as she's
always got a level head about her and she had a really good suggestion that
I'm willing to take a shot at.  She said, &quot;Well your talent is the
mechanical work.  Surely there is someone on you list who does body work but
can't seem to handle mechanical work.  It'd be nice if you could work out a
trade.&quot;

So I guess that's what I'm offering.  Is there anyone who'd like to tackle
the body work on this 67 in exchange for me doing some mechanical work on
their dub?  Since body work is such an intensive thing I would fully expect
that whatever I rebuild be it an engine, front end, (no transmissions), etc.
that I would foot the total bill for the parts and labor in exchange for the
body work.

It's a shot in the dark but one I'm willing to take before I do the
unthinkable.
