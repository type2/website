&gt; Can I disable the cylinder, ie, remove plug, pushrods, and get back (600

Hi Cal,
If you remove just the spark plug wire you will have about a 50% drop in HP.  
If you remove the rocker arms to that cylinder, the piston and connecting rod 
and figure a way to hose clamp the oil port from the crank shut you will 
loose about 33% HP.  Check your ignition system and if that does not do the trick 
you really need to drop the engine and have a set of heads ready to replace 
your old ones.  Otherwise if it is a strecthing valve it could take out the rest 
of the engine at any time!
