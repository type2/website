THOM...the man named &quot;Yoshiyasu Ito&quot; sent a file to the mailing list named
&quot;HAPPY99&quot;...IT IS A VIRUS AND DID INFECT MY COMPUTER &quot;WITHOUT&quot; OPENING
IT...you need to remove it from the archives as well, if theres still
time..subject heading reads &quot;Need help!!&quot; ...he IS gonna need help if I ever
catch his ass...im sure you are now at the classic and everyone on the list
will get the attachment..which is prolly exactly what he wanted. This virus
also attaches itself to all outgoing mail but I have cleaned my computer of
it already
