&gt;Anyone ever remove their own tires?
&gt;  I heard a guy once say he used a utility knife and just cut
&gt;the tires off?  Could it be that simple?

Well, no. there is a steel cord inside the bead area.
But you could remove the carcass with a knife, then wedge
the bead off to the inside and cut it with a grinder. half an hour.
might as well do one so you'll know.
