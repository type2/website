Hi!

I have a request:  While Michele and I are stripping the paint off of our
'66 Westy, we keep ourselves going by visualizing the way she'll look upon
completion(the bus, not Michele!)...does anyone have a picture of a bus with
a Sea Blue lower half?  What would it take to get you to send it to us?
Several pics in different light would really be handy, as the nature of that
hue is to change dramatically depending upon the lighting.

We are going to stay with Pearl White for the top and interior ( I am busy
trying to figure out how not to re-paint the entire interior!).  I realize
that this is not proper, but, well, uh....hmm.

At any rate, I would really appreciate a photog or two...

TIA,

Gene
