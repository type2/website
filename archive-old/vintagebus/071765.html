Subject: point gap - who is right???

So ive always thought the 009 point gap should be .016. Thats just always what ive been told and
seen in all the manuals, so thats how ive always done it.
Then im surfin the net the other night and i notice someone is calling out points get set at .019.
So i do a search in the VB archive and see someone is saying &quot;i set the point gap at proper .018&quot;
although he didnt mention what distributor......

So which is it and why? .016, .018, .019?
Or this another one of those opinion subjects?

Thanks for any input
-Wade
