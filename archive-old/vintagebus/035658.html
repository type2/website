&lt;&lt; Normally I try to have outdoor projects completed by this time of
 year...but I ended up last night stringing tarps over/around the Westy and
 performing a front brake job and some sheet metal repairs while snowflakes
 were falling ever so slightly around my little camp enclosure.  Had it not
 been for the 3-500 watt halogen light fixtures I had strategically placed
 nearby, I think I would have just said to hell with it!
 So what do ya think about that NQ!  And I've got about another 6 or 7 days
 work do do out there yet.
 I'm thinking about cutting up my electric blanket and sewing it into a
 body suit I can wear...then running an extension cord to it and cranking
 it up to 10!  Maybe I won't mind the working conditions that way.
 Work ten minutes...warm up the hands for 5.  Almost getting work done now.
 later

I have a propane heater- the thing screws onto a refillable bottle- cost me 
$40 at Homedepot- and worth every penny.    I use it in the garage, and can 
carry it around, great for instant heat, and propane is cheap.  You can tote 
it outside and point it which way you want, warm your hands, dry your wet 
clothes, etc.   Just be careful, it does get hot don't burn your self or 
catch anything on fire.
