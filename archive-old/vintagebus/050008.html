Subject: Re: [VB] Error in the Tom Wilson rebuild book...

I think the John Muir book gives a good explanation of the case assembly
procedure.

&gt;I was browsing the type2 list from the web (egroups_dot_com) looking for
&gt;help and I noticed a post indicating you were once in the same boat as
&gt;I now find myself in!  I'm hoping maybe you can provide some advice.
&gt;I'm in the process of rebuilding my bus motor and am just about done.
&gt;I've been primarily using the Wilson book and specifically used it to
&gt;orient the dizzy... basically straddle the bottom case seam with the
&gt;two dots on the crank gear, dot on the can gear fits between and rotor
&gt;points  to the notch on the distributor body... hmm.  Well, when I did
&gt;it I thought, this makes no sense, the rod for #1 is in mid throw,
&gt;nowhere near TDC.  But, I decided okey dokey, who am I to question
&gt;Doc. Wilson?  Well, now that I've built the engine up to the valve
&gt;train I *know* that what he describes is just plain wrong.  Hence, my
&gt;search and up pops your message.  I'm guessing you were using Wilson
&gt;too ;-).  Did you pull the gear and reorient?  If so, how?  My biggest
&gt;nightmare is trying to do this and losing those shims at the bottom of
&gt;the gear in the case.  Following is your message to jog your memory.
&gt;If you have any suggestions, please respond directly to me as I'm not
&gt;currently described to the list.........................
&gt;===================================================
&gt;
&gt;The reason I bring this up is I had the exact same problem.  The book is
&gt;either vague or wrong in this area and it has caused yet another VW engine
&gt;rebuilder to make a mistake.  I think the problem deserves correcting - does
&gt;anyone have any thoughts on this?
