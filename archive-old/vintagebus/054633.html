Subject: [VB] Doc project stuff

I updated the site.  No big deal, no new docs, but I added a page for
contributors to the project and cleaned up a little bit.  Since most (all?)
of the contributors (10!) are on this list, I was hoping I could get them
to make sure I got their names in the right spots and etc.  So, if you have
(or think you have ;-)) contributed to the project, please check out the
new layout and make sure you're where you deserve to be.  In particular, 
check:

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/thanks.html

And if you feel like it, check the manuals you've contributed to to be sure
I didn't goof.  It's been several months in some cases, so please forgive me
if I left something out and let me know about it.  

Added a &quot;mirrors&quot; section.  Thanks VintageBus!

Finally, it's &quot;scanning season&quot;...in other words, I'll be out of school pretty
soon.  If you'd like to have something scanned for the project over the winter
break please let me know.  Of course, we _really_ like pre-scanned stuff :-)

Bus content: The other day I went to adjust the passenger mirror and it
broke off!!  I also discovered that my steering box is a little loose, and
I have no toe-in whatsoever.  Looking forward to Bulli Brigade!
