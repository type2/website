Subject: Re: [VB] Bowden Tube

&gt;A few on the list were helping me with this, but didn't know the answer
&gt;so I'll post to everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Was there ever a change in length for the bowden tube?  The one I took
&gt;off my big nut tranny (in a 62 crew cab) seemed to have too much swage
&gt;in it.  Almost an inch more than the Bentley said it should have.  I
&gt;couldn't find anyway to adjust it out, am I wrong?  I could see how
&gt;adding washers would induce more bend in the tube, but the one I took
&gt;off didn't have any in there.    Anyone know how long in inches the tube
&gt;should be?
&gt;
&gt;BTW my parts book only shows one tube with no years designation.
&gt;
&gt;Sleeve - Clutch Cable 311 721 365
&gt;
&gt;Is this correct???


Here's my info:

Bus, '50-'67              311 721 361
Beetle, Ghia, '46-71      311 721 361
Beetle, Ghia, some '74    311 721 361
Type 3, '62-'73           311 721 361
Bus, '68-79               211 721 361D
Beetle, Ghia, '72-'74     211 721 361D
Beetle, Ghia, '74-'79     111 721 361E


Above is from WW and RMMW catalogs.  Unfortunately, dimensions are not
indicated.  Perhaps Bentley lists lengths?
