Subject: RE: brakes - strange problem

&gt; &gt;and i didn't slow down (almost time to panic).  i pushed a bit harder and my
&gt; &gt;left front wheel locked up pulling me to the left.  thun the wheel like crazy
&gt; &gt;to the right to compensate then all of a sudden the right front brake
&gt; locks up
&gt; &gt;and whips me to the right extreemely hard, all the way into the next lane! 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;can anyone offer an explanation as to what happened and why it isn't
&gt; happening
&gt; &gt;now?
&gt; 
&gt; I vote for replacing the rubber brake hoses...
&gt; 
I'll second Jeff's vote (along with half the list postees). Clara's
right, do all four while you're thinking about it.

Keep in mind, also, that if you drive through a deep puddle or just pull
out of the car wash your brakes will act _really_funky_ until they dry
out. This can cause them to brake slow or pull to one side or the other
temporarily; give everyone lots of room and test frequently until
they're dry.
