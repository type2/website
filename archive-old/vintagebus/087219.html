Subject: Re: [VB] Suggestions for tap/die set

The threads for installing pop-out windows are in the frame; you don't need to thread the bus.
the hinges and piece for the pop-out latches to screw into?need to be sourced from a parts bus and welded onto your bus.
I needed a tap for the bolts that hold the RGBs onto the spring plates.?? i went to Sears and compared prices on one tap versus a whole set, ?and bought a metric tap and die set.?? It is so useful.
?? I've replaced a couple here and there... the more common ones that I use more often.

................................

I want to clean up threads, as well as create new threads for additional pop-outs. My Standard-Deluxe (European spec) came with only two pop-outs and I want to put in pop-outs all the way back. 3.5 mm x .6 mm pitch is right (sorry). Doesn't look like HBF has that size. Sears doesn't tell you what you get. So building my own looks like the way to go...?
