 Got a neat alum bottle ( like the screw on Coca Cola ones) opener out of a
50's westy that had about 4 coats of white house paint on it. Put it in carb
cleaner for an hour and got all the paint off. Don't look to vintage, but
who knows, might be that unheard of early Westy acces that even Greg don't
have. Has W. Germany cast in 2 places on the back and PROGRESSUS cast on the
front lower area.  Anyone know what it is? If it is vintage, Greg gets 1st
shot.

 Also watch out for the epoxy primers, they work to good most times. A stock
bus had &quot;ripples&quot; on the long side where side panel was tacked on from
factory ( at upright braces) about every 2 feet or so. If a bus has the side
perfectly smooth it is wrong ( flame me if you want, but look at any
unrestored bus)  The epoxy primer is so thick ( deep ) that it takes out the
ripples with a hand long board, looks great, but wrong. If you look close
this is always a give away on a restored bus,  harder to see on double doors
though

 By the way, Kyle was 1st to email on the single cab spare tire treasure
chest mounts so they go to Phoenix March 23.

 Glad the archive tiff seems to be over, was almost hoping someone would
bring up tire size and rpm's again, almost more interesting.

 Whats a fair price for a good Judson supercharger only, no lower pulley or
oiler, just the supercharger unit with pully mounted?
