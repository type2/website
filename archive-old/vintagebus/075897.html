Subject: wiper motor brushes Q.

The windshield wipers in my 67 only worked in low so I pulled the motor 
assembly out and when I removed the cover one brush and spring fell out. The other 
two look in sad shape. Can anyone guide me in a direction to find some 
replacement brushes or other sources of knowledge in this area? Thanks in advance.
