Subject: Re: [VB] RE:transporter restoration books

I've got some good howtos on my site, and MetWiz has been uploading
pix and descriptions of one of the most intense teardowns a bus
has ever seen: http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/metwiz.html

&gt; Try J.C. Whitney catalog and look for the Transporter restoration and
&gt; customizing manual. costs about $18 and is ONLY a preliminary. I have NEVER
&gt; seen a nose to tail restoraion book, although so many on the list have done
&gt; so and thoughtlessly never took detailed pictures and wrote a book for the
&gt; rest of us! heheh
