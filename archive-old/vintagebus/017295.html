Hey Jerry,
Let me know and we can take my &quot;worthless&quot; '54 6v 36hp
full crashbox (1st and reverse) tranny and tow it home
with it's Brink brand assy hitch if your bus breaks
down =) The '54 made it to the Classic and back two
years running. I found this year that a trailer was
mostly an inconvenience.
We could pop the RAF barn era safaris and enjoy those
killer hills.
