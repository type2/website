Running lights and license light are on the same circuit.  In fact,
the license light is usually strung off of the right-side running
light.

Single bulbs, two filaments each.  One filament is the running light,
the other is the brake/turn light.

Do you have turn signals?  If so, then the problem is in the turn
signal switch, the brake switch (on the master cylinder), or the
wiring in between those items.

If you don't have turn signals in the rear, then the problem's in the
turn signal switch, a blown fuse, up-front wiring, or bad grounds in
the back.

This is, of course, somewhat simplified, but covers the bulk of the
situations....
