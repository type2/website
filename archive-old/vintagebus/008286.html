well, almost done, these last few weeks have been h#_at_l
but the bus is almost done (1960 double door, bus rescue)
started with 60 double door shell, no rear hatch, no pass door
no tranny, no steering , rusty rocker, rusty rear quarters
no speedo, switchs, handels etc, and lo and behold i drove her
today, with new paint, speedo, latching doors (all doors), switchs, gauges
glass, (still need 2 of those single pane camper windows),
new tires, brakes etc. even rebuilt 1 of the reduction boxes
after her maiden voyage this morning, with vw howard and beto
there witnessing and doing the photo work, always take the photo of
the buses first voyage out of the shop door, look for me at the octo
and the classic in the almost sealing wax red double door next to
vw howards green ez camp with the matching single tire trailer (way cool)

and the next adventure begins (redo the 66 westy walkthru for colorado shows
in auqust)

61 single cab for trade ( 15 window delux)
64 kombi  500.00
