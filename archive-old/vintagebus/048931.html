Naturally, after spending a few hours crawling around the bus I've better determined its condition.  Happy to say my first prognosis wasn't too far off, but it does have a few things that will need to be dealt with.  First, name plate data:

21 01 9 = 21 January 1959
378 = ????????
130 = Type 24 without sunroof &amp; roof windows
175 = Overriders all models
U = USA
L = ??????? (Los Angeles?)
241 = Deluxe Microbus, cargo doors right, LHD
BGR = Beige Grey (yippee)
SR = Sealing Wax Red  (yippee again)
431172 = Chassis #

It also has the crashbox tranny which I was stoked about, only for value reasons, not for practicality.

Anyone know what M Code 378 is?

Looks like the front floorpan corners will need to be replaced, surprise, surprise.  Also, the area where the cargo area floorpans meet the bulkhead wall is pretty thin, especially in the center of the floor.  Not much daylight but its soft.  At this point it looks as though only about 12&quot; wide and the center 2 to 3 feet is the extent of it.  Wheelwells, and all jackpoints are very solid.  Right side outer rocker has been replaced at some point in time, fortunately done correctly.  The floorpan sill at the cargo door opening is very solid which was a surprise.  All frame members are straight and solid, absolutely no dents or bends.  Both cab doors and both cargo doors are solid.  The left cargo door lock mechanism is bent so the lower lock post won't pull up.  I'll have to disassemble.  Right cargo door hinge has a small amount of movement in it when the door is opened and closed so that will have to be looked into.  Rear hatch works great but the glass is cracked, arrgghhh &gt;:(  Going to need a new rear apron and deck lid.  New battery tray as well.  The front nose appears to have been dinged, but very minor.  Rain gutters are all sound.  Roofline has a few small bubbles but nothing close to being through.  Left side dogleg looks like it's had some work where it meets the side skin.  Looks like collision, not rust.  Should be easy to straighten back out.  The whole left side skin looks like replacement.  It's perfect, but from the inside when you pull the interior panels back the color of the inside of the skin is primer grey, not SWR like the other side.  None of the side rails/ribs have been bent (as far as I can tell) so I'm not sure whats up.  There are some places where the skin isn't tack welded to the rails/ribs so that will have to be addressed. From the outside it's one piece, all the way down from the beltline to the bottom edge of the outer rocker, NOS replacement?  Bumpers are toast.  No beltline moulding but I already knew that and accumulated a set over the summer.

Interior: dash opening has been slightly cut, basically the rounded corners are now square.  Post holes are the same original diameter.  Rear and middle seats are there but no bars on top.  Being a commercail guy, I'm not too up on Deluxes, but I have a feeling there should be bars on both seats.  The middle seat is full length with a split seat at the cargo doors.  All panels are there but showing their age.  Headliner gone, not that it would have stayed.  Coat hooks were in a box in the back, along with half of the engine vent trim.  Visors are toast.  Jailbars are there.

This weekend might reveal more, but I think this bus is quite solid for it's age and will be a fairly straight forward restoration, except for the usual 1000 things that will need to be addressed.  My wife already has dibs on it.  She's slowly getting the VW virus also, which I'm really happy about.  She wants it for her daily driver.  I'll always be in a SC or DC so what the hell.  I'll drive it on weekends.
