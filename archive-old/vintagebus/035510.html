If Manson had a bus he probably STOLE it!. Besides how could a bus be &quot;evil&quot;? 
 I'm sure that whatever bus he was in had enough &quot;Groovy Vibes&quot; to offset the 
evil that his butt had on the seat.

I beg to differ.  There was a particular 67 westy I had that had evil vibes.  
I think it was partly  from association with the PO who had had it for many 
years .  It was a very abused and sick twisted (spiritually, not physically) 
bus, and was not a happy  or groovy  at all.  I tried to heal it, and to some 
extent succeeded.   But not completely.  In fact its evil aura came out in a 
photograph.  I was glad to see that bus go away.

Think I'll go douse my self in patchouli and burn some incense now.
