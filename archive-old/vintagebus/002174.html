&gt;But my brother says that you can remove the axle
&gt;tubes(redux and all) without tapin' into the breaks. I
&gt;told him he was full of it(he's a bug guy himself). So, can you do this?
&gt;If so how?
&gt;


In short, no. Brake backing plate, lower outer bearing and bearing retainer
must come off to split the redux boxes, so you can get the top gear off. The
circlip on the axle end holds the top gear on the axle, the gear holds the
axle tube and inner redux box half, etc. You have to remove the tube to get
the big snap-ring that holds the side gears in and so on. Not like a bug if
that is what he is thinking of.
