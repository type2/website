My experience with this is problem fresh enough that my blood pressure is
still recovering, so here's my tale of woe:

Bad News: An anonymous neighbor complains to the county about my junk
vehicles ['66 crewcab on jacks in the garage, '73 insect-type VW in the
driveway]. S/He didn't come talk to me, say something like &quot;Hi neighbor,
nice to meet ya, how's about movin' your POS's?&quot; Went straight to The Man.
So at the end of another 10 hours chained to my cubicle, I come home to find
a WARNING taped to my door, giving me 10 days to remove the &quot;abandoned
vehicles&quot; from my property before the 60 days in jail &amp;/or $1000 fine per
day kicks in. Bummer mas grande.

Good News: The next morning, I call the inspector named on my guvmint
warning. &quot;Look,&quot; he says, &quot;if somebody complains, we gotta do an inspection,
and if there's something there to write up, we gotta write it up. Sorry.&quot;
But he is surprisingly sympathetic to my problem. I ask him what I can do
short of selling off my VWs that will make him happy, and he says that if a
vehicle is tagged and *appears* to be operable in the inspector's opinion,
wink-wink-nudge-nudge, then it's not a junk vehicle. The insect is tagged
and running, so my only problem is getting the crewcab kosher. After a day
spent in tag lines, several days hunting desperately for a set of bus wheels
[thanks BFY and Vintage Warehouse], and several very late nights of
reassembly, all is well.

Conclusions: This could've turned out much worse than it did. In my
area --Atlanta 'burbs--my new inspector buddy tells me, the zoning rules
prohibit practically any automotive work at a residence, up to &amp; including
oil changes. The philosophy seems to be to outlaw everything, so when they
do decide to throw the book at a guy, it's a hefty book. I do agree with
Thom that we don't have the right to an eyesore that offends our community,
but if a neighbor has to go out of his way, even trespass, to find my
eyesore, then it should be _his_  problem. But that's not the way the laws
are written. What offends me most about this whole episode is that my
[assumptions follow] yuppie, new to _my_ neighborhood [I've been here since
'65] neighbor couldn't take the time to introduce himself and make his
problems known to me. If he'd done so, I would've happily done all the
things I ended up doing anyway, and we could've left the guvmint out of it.
Maybe we'd even be friends by now. Stranger things have happened.

Ultimate Conclusion: The world has too few volkswagen people and too many
yuppies, with disastrous karmic consequences for the planet. Old news.

I feel much better for having gotten this off my chest. Sorry for the
bandwidth.

Jim
