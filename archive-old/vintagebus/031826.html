Subject: [VB] Binz Blueprints?


Just for the heck of it, I emailed Binz and asked them if they can still
convert a single cab over to a Binz or if they had blueprints they could
sell that would detail the conversion.  (I know it was a long shot but what
the hell?)

Here is the cryptic reply I got:

We are extremely sorry but cannot help you in this matter. It's too long.
Sorry.
Kind regards
Ingrid Floruss



Whatever that means...
