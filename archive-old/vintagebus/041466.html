something i can tell you, from working with various similar (and
dissimilar) seals in the automotive sunroof industry..  if you stretch it,
it will only shrink back later.  Maybe 6 days, maybe 6 months, but i'll
guaruntee it will return to its current size, or smaller.

ask Ford about the Webasto seals it has had to replace ove rthe
years...they still havent figured out how (i guess!) to get their machines
to _dot_compress. the seal, not stretch it...


g'luck, eh?
