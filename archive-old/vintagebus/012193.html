1) I purchase a 65´ Kombi the last week, i want to repaint it but i dont 
know if i need to disamble all the kombi, i mean to put off the engine, 
transmision, wheels, suspension, etc...
 
2) do i need to put something under the paint to make durable the 
painting job. What paints do you recomend.
 
 
P.D. Excuse my english.
