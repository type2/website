Subject: Re: [VB] dizzy's &amp; TX listee's

2 problems here:
1) AE engines are 71 to 73 bug engines. They use a dual vacuum dual advance
distributor.

2) almost all distributor rebuilders lump a dozen or so engines under one
'rebuilt' part number without caring what the specs were for each engine.
A prime example is the second link below. The Philbin Group says #10-0907 is
suitable for bugs and buses. WRONG! [the 10-0907 is a vacuum advance only
dizzy]
The 1st one they list, 1584 cc, 67-68 1600 bus originally used a 0 231 137 021
with a 07 024 vacuum unit. This vacuum unit is timed at 0 degrees and gives
17-19 degrees _at_ 1.3 in.hg and 32-35 degrees _at_ 3.2 in.hg. This same 0 231 137
021 dist. was used on the 68 type 1 w/MT.
The 66-67 1500 bus they also say this 10-0907 dizzy fits originally came with
a 0 231 137 011 with a 07 017 vacuum unit. This vacuum unit timed at 7.5
before TDC and gives 17-19 degrees _at_ 1.3 in.hg. and 24-28 degrees _at_ 3.2 in.hg.
The 66-67 type 1 with the 1300 and the 1500 used  0 231 137 009 with the same
07 017 vacuum unit as above.

Type 1 crank pulleys were a strange mess. Some have one mark, some have 2,
some have 3. One mark could be 5 after or TDC or 7.5 before. Let's say you
happen to have one mark and it is 7.5 before. Then you install the 10-0907
from above or a 0 231 137 021 [113 905 205M or T] with a 07 024 [279 on the
arm]. Adding the 7.5 initial + the 32-35 gives you a total advance of 40 to 43
degrees. Way too much for a type 1 engine. If the mark was 5 after, you would
wonder where your power went!

And their #10-0908 is the same as the 1st dist they list under 10-0907!!!


&gt; &gt;  Just lookin to see if anyone within a few hours from here has one of
those
&gt; &gt; nasty vac dizzys they might want to trade for a 009... or a couple of
009s...
&gt; &gt; or whatever:)... those vac advance things aint worth a flip no ways....
&gt; &gt; right:)  Need one for a AE 1600 case or newer...
&gt; &gt;  If one cant be found here near (yes, a few hours is near) Ill broadin the
&gt; &gt; search:)
&gt;
&gt; Oddly enough you can buy a rebuilt for cheap.
