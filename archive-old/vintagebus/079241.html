  You cannot buy halon extinquishers any longer (in the U S). My fire service store can still recharge and keep the dates
 current, but doesn't sell new.

&gt;&gt; I thought Halon was a CFC and NLA.  I was led to
&gt;&gt; believe it's been unavailable for years.
&gt;
&gt;I had thought halon was a issue too. I was kind of surprised last week,
&gt;the guys who do our extinguishers at the studio came in with a bunch of
&gt;recharged and tested halon bottles.
