Subject: another lurker peeks out from behind the bushes

Since we're all chiming in here, I have been on this list for a couple years.
Ever since I got rid of the fatchik 71 westie for the 58 single cab.

Its comforting to know the community is out there, even if it is quiet at
times...

Bus Content:  Drove the sc up to the mountains above Boulder on a camping trip
couple of weekends ago, an area called Jonnie Park (a valley due east of Longs
Peak).
Gnarly dirt road, lots of J**ps, F*rds, t*y*t*s, and  me, the grinning hippy
in the old VW.
Made up no problem, the reduction gears allow me to climb purt near anything.
Even fully loaded to the gunwales with wood, coolers, tents etc....

Monday AM, pre-dawn, down the mtn to get to wrk on time.  Driving in the dark
made the road all that much more fun....OOOOOPPPPS off comes the stinger
exhaust on a rock.  Well not off, off, but sticking out straight behind me,
like a pointers tail.  Bending it back got me home, and a few days later I'm
bolting on the stock german muffler.
Thanks Ronnie!  (btw, when are the heat exchange collars coming to me in the
mail?)

Then yesterday a guy who runs a body shop in town gives me his card and says:
Lemme know when you want to sell your truck.
Dream On, Bro.

So, We're out here, keeping these moving museums on the road!

Keep the split view alive!
