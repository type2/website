 ...The two what?  Chrome or not chrome?  usually chrome is shiny, sort of like a mirror, unless it is my cat Chrome who is black except for the shiny spiked leather collar. Not chrome is generally another colour. In the case of cooling tin it came black, unless someone else repainted it.  In terms of functioanlity black is best.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sorry, but you must phrase that in the form of a question.
