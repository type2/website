They are found as the drain plugs in the center section of the tranny.  same 
hex 17mm size and everything (except split case came with the outie 19mm 
ones).  BUildt in magnet inside (hey Steve when did you last change you gear 
oil?   you should clean the magnets when you do)

 New- I never bought one new, unlike fuel pumps, but they may well be out 
there.
