BALL CAPS, BALL CAPS, BALL CAPS

Thing about baseball caps is
1) It isn't being done - there are at least 2 people doing t-shirts so why
cut into there business and lots of people have t-shirts but no-one has an
AIRS or Type2_dot_com ball cap
2) go to a show and you would recognize list members from a distance
3) can't think of 3 now but got to be other advantages of caps over tees
