A few of us from Fresno are going down to the pre-OCTO campout Saturday. Anybody from the O's? Sacrament, Modest? Anybody stuck in Lodi? We could meet up with NorCalsat thebase of the Grapevine. Karl will probably take his most recent &quot;IT'S ALIVE&quot; bus so the pace won't be 75 mph. (well it could be, junkyard find withkadrons)Nate, Craig, Thom, Brett?Andrew Stockton's daughters? 

If you're interested in a speedometer overlay, check out a veryslick program that prints all kinds of graph paper. Begware from www.marquis-soft_dot_com , was featured in the ZDnet download of the day. Look under Misc., Dials. Change the arc, radius, divisions, scale, etc. Very cool, you'll get lost in all the stuff. 
He has other tools for maintenance scheduling ofequipment, statistical analysis, medical stuff. 
BTW, one of the best free utilities I've seen is called PrintKey 2000, available at www.zdnet_dot_com . Press the PrtSc key and select portions of the screen to capture, edit or print. Great screen scraper.
