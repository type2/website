I was told those numbers on the diagram have to do with amps or  ohms or
something

&gt;Everett,
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering that myself while sitting on the couch memorizing my wiring
diagrams.  I thought that maybe it was a diameter in mm or something, but
that still didn't add up completely.  I would love to know the origins of
those numbers as well.  For now I know how thick a tail light wire and brake
light wire are so I just compare to those.
&gt;
&gt;You mention buying wire at the store.  You aren't going to do the whole
harness in red wire like the PO of every bus I have ever bought, are you?  I
was thinking of doing Roberts panel in all dove blue wiring.  Wouldn't that
be a snazzy car show eye catcher and a pain for any future owner.  Actually,
I just rebuilt the original harness with the original color of wire and it
looks great and works great.
&gt;
