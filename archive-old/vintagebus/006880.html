There are a lot of different processes of chromeing, the key is in the prep.
Taiwan cheap chrome uses a single dip method, bassicaly clean and polish the
steel and dip in the chrome vat. Quality chrome uses a few more processes,
1. polish and clean the metal.  2. first dip in copper. 3. polish again, if
any imperfections polish and dip in copper again. 4. dip the copper coated
piece in nickel, this gives it a dull finish, 5. dip in the chrome solution
then you have a finished product, this is what is so called triple plated
chrome which in reality is the old school way of doing it, but they had to
name it to make quality chrome sound special. If you have cheap chrome
that's rusting best to just replace the part as you will peobally never stop
the rust.

Sounds like cheep chrome plating to me.  Now days many repop trim items have
hardly any chrome on them.  Replace or re-chrome these items.  Is the rust
only showing up on chromed items?  Most hubcaps you get from the vendor
whores are horrible with regards to plating.
