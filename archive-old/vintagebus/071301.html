Subject: Re: [VB] Tire size question

----- Original Message -----
&gt; Anyways.....On my 63 I run 215/75/15's (rear) with no probs whatsoever.
Another SV2's friend of mine runs 215's on his 59 DD panel.  He says it's
tight getting them on, but once on, no issues whatsoever.

On our bus cruise/campout last weekend, Dave and his 66 bus were sporting
215/75r15's on all four corners of his bus. Rears cleared fine, but when
going through some rough articulation and the wheels turned, he did dig one
front tire in the wheel well.

I've got a set of 15&quot; bug rims laying around, and have thought of getting
some all-terrain tires, 205 for the front, and 215 for the rear, just for
camping, but for now, there are other things i'm buying for my bus (just
replaced all the door seals last night!), so they'll have to wait. Maybe
i'll have em for next season.......
