Subject: Spraying POR-15

After finishing off the front window frames and inside the front doors I
have started stripping the bed in preparation for a coating of POR-15.
Since it is a large area I would like to spray on the two coats.  I am
looking for suggestions on what type of spray gun to use for this?  This
time I will also be using the Tie-Coat as a primer and have some solvent to
clean up with.

Regards,

Thomas
