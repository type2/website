In a message dated 98-10-22 15:32:35 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I would think in the pre '71 models that the bearing is always in constant
 contact with the pressure plate, even if it is just the top or bottom edge --
 just touching, not under any pressure.  Unless the bearing is magically
 balanced, it will tilt forward and backward, bringing one edge in contact.
&gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
Well with the proper clips sprung onto the throw out arm the bearing retains
the angle last encountered with the clutch pressure plate.  Due to the surface
friction between the throw out forks and the areas of the bearing that
countact the throw out arm.  Otherwise VW would have had volks set the play of
the clutch pedal to 0 instead of about 1/2&quot;.   Eric &amp; Barb
