Greetings,

Melbourne Cup Today.  I think Australis is the only
place to have a public holiday in honour of a horse race 8-)!!

Anyway, a question.  I'm about to RECO my first set of
big nut reduction boxes (done a few early RGBs) and I 
noticed that the N207E roller bearing is the first to tackle.
I hadn't really thought about this ....... the puller
I made for the 6206 ball bearing on the early boxes (like
flat sided balls that you stick in and rotate to
grab the inner race) doesn't look like it's going to fit
in the N207E because of the cage...in fact I can't really
see how any 'inner' puller could fit in there?  Do you sacrifice
the bearing and trash the cage in order to get it out?  

Thanks

RobK
