Subject: RE: stereo that fits without any cutting

 I to went this way but with a little twist. I took an Pioneer 8-track
player, took the face plate off and gutted the insides. I then installed a
small piano hinge along the bottom of the face plate and the 8 track body.
with the insides hollowed out I was able to mount a CD player in side very
nicely. I have showed the bus numerous times at local shows and only the
people I have showed how it works have ever known it was anything more than
a 8-track player.

I mounted a detachable-face CD player on the package tray right below the
radio and some surface-mount speakers on the underside the tray.  Then I
used a stock block off plate on the dash.  I managed to do all this and only
had to drill about 3 small holes in the tray, all easily fixed or replaced
with another tray.
