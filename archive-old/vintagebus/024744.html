I have been going stir crazy with this darn flu the last few days and snuck out
today for a quick trip to the junk yard.  I picked up two Fuel Pump relays, one
out of an Audi and one out of a VW, both with Bosch CIS FI.  After experimenting
with them, I have a circuit that will allow the fuel pump to run while the
engine is turning.  One half second after the engine stops turning, the fuel
pump shuts off.  I could not believe how simple the circuit ends up being.
One wire (heavy) directly to the battery
One wire to the coil (+)
One wire to the coil (-)
One wire to ground
One wire (heavy) to the fuel pump (+)

That's it.  I experimented with it and it works just as described.  I even went
further and opened up the box and drew out the circuit.

I put together a page describing all of this, providing connections and a
schematic.  The schematic is a little fuzzy due to trying to save space.  I can
email a larger JPG to anybody wanting a very clear schematic of the relay.  In
reality though, the circuit is so simple, a schematic is not needed.

All the info can be found at
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/relay.html

In case anybody was wondering, I will be using this relay to power the CIS Fuel
Injection Fuel Pump that I am putting on my Type IV 2.0L motor that is going
into my '60 Double Cab.

   Passing Thought -
        If at first you don't succeed.....get new batteries.
