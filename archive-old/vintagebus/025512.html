Hello listies,

here a request (absolutely no commercial reasons) whereby I would like
to have responce from owners of busses of '50 and earlier.
The reason is that a fellow bus owner ('50) is making an inventory of
owners of such busses worldwide. (I offered to try via this list)

I would appreciate to recieve your (busses) name, bus type/year/model,
country/state.


Hope you will not let me and my Dutch fellow busowner, down.

Thanks in advance

'Will'
