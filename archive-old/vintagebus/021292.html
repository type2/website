I was looking through Thom's really cool registry and M-codes and I saw that 
there is a code for a 1 ton bus. (M215) I was wondering what is done 
different to make it handle the extra load. I know they come with the 1500 
(after Jan '63?) , so are the brakes bigger or anything or transmission 
beefier? I drive a 1 ton Ford van daily for my job and I know everything is 
different than the Ford passenger van my dad has (is used to be a camper too!)
 ==============
through 63 the type II were considered 3/4 ton.    in 64 they came with a 
beefier suspesion and bigger brakes.    THis and a 1500 motor were the 1 ton 
package.


I was looking at some spinndle/kingpins the other day looking for a good left 
one to replace the one on my65 camper (rather than pay for a rebuild)   and 
found one in my stash, Cleaning it up I realised the link pin bshings and 
their holes were smaller.  THis spindle fwith the later threads for the later 
brakes was set  up to us ethe 63 and earlier link pins   looking in the parts 
list and there it lists one kind for hrough 63, another for 64 and later, 
with out any m 215 exceptions.  Anyone plled apart their m215 63 and found it 
this way.???   

ANyway I had to dig further and fin a regular stlye spindle,
