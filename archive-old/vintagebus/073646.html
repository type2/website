Bill,

While not in the &quot;I know Bob or at least I bought a bus from Bob&quot; club,
my wife and I are going over to enjoy the event and the country after
the show.  Flying in to Frankfurt on the 18th.  Count us in for at least
a stein or two. I'd be interested in the pre show events that are on the
schedule.  

Though I love the slow(bus) lane, I have to admit I'm really looking
forward to blasting around the autobahn in the Audi were renting... now
if it were only an M3:-0

Steve
