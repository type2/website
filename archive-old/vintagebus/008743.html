Really, want some snow? We've had about enough already, 21 inches total so
far in December and it's still on the ground and temps are pretty wintry
too, near 0 degrees for the last week with some days going down to 10 below.
Cool ha?? Hope the brake in the weather comes soon, I got to pick-up my bus.

Talking about Chicago area.

All the best to all!!!!

&gt; I smiled when I saw these pics.  Highs in Phoenix are around 70.
&gt;
&gt; Happy Holidays one and all.
