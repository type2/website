Subject: [VB] '60 panel trade
Message-ID: &lt;0.684ba15f.25529829_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hey everyone, I am the guy who has been asking everyone if they want to trade 
a split bus for a '54 bug. I have received a lot of responses, but I can't 
send pictures yet, and I started to get picky. Anyway, there is a guy in WAY 
Northern Cal who really wants to trade a '60 panel for my bug. I need advice 
though on whether or not I should go through with it. The bus is a '60 
walk-thru panel. All it is missing are the taillights, and the headlights, 
housing and all. Other than that, it is complete. He also said he has a back 
seat for it. That is the good part. The bad is that the PO cut 3 westy style 
windows on each side, with one on both doors. It has all the glass for these, 
but I would probably have these fixed. Does anybody know how difficult or it 
is or how to do this? The other bad part is that he took the motor out to put 
into something else.  He will give me a spare motor, but he said it leaks 
really bad. The bus itself is completely rust free, and only has a small dent 
in the nose that looks like it has bondo in it. DOes this seem like a good 
bus to you guys? Basically, I just want some feedback. THANKS!!!
