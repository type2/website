Just a little more real life experiences:  I lived in my bus for two years,
traveling around the NW, carried all the required stuff, and when things
went bad all I had to do was buy two new tires and rebuild the motor cause
the head came off via pulling the bolts.  With the new motor with case
savers and tires it was good for over 100K until an engine fire finnally
took her down.  But, I felt very comfortable carrying a good supply of spare
parts and actually you don't need that many tools.
