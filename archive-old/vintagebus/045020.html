&lt;&lt; To suggest, as you did in your last post, that you can't buy the bus 
because it is now off of the internet and that the bus was withdrawn from the 
market based on email discussions is not logical. &gt;&gt;

The bus was withdrawn because it looks like the '56 Oval he had up for sale 
is sold (Well, probably)  He only needed to sell one.
