Hi Carl,
Do you mean the oil light never comes on when you turn off the ignition 
switch?  This is normal only the gen/alt light will go on while the engine is 
RPMing down.  The oil pressure light only should turn on when you first turn 
on the ignition switch after it has been shut off for a few minutes or more.
