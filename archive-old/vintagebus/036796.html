Subject: powdercoating in los angeles
To: getsmarx_at_hotmail_dot_com, VintagVW_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Can anyone really recommend a good powdercoating facility in the Los Angeles 
or Ventura counties?
Im looking to get a set of 5 15&quot; bus rims sandblasted and powdercoated 
semi-gloss black.
Then I was going to follow up and paint the faces L311/L312 sand green/palm 
green.
Any sugestions? Hints?
Im right thinking that VW powdercoated early rims and then simply painted the 
faces correct?
Or am I going about this the wrong way?
Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
Did VW use metal tire valves? Or just the cheap old k-mart rubber ones? 
Anyone got a picture of an original tire valve?
Does anyone aside from Firestone make a nice all blackwall 6.40X15&quot; biased 
ply tire?
Regards, Greg
