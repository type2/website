WOW!!  Way more work than I would do....

Subject: Body off restoration


Some of you may remember me writing about someone in Holland who is doing a
complete 'body off' resto of a split window bus. Since the basic build-up of
a bay is not too different of that of a split the pictures of this resto are
giving some insights you would never otherwise get.

I have recently added two more pages (bodywork 1 and 2) so you may want to
come back and have a look.

Goto to http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus and click on &quot;T1 restoration&quot; (under
the heading &quot;Technical&quot;) to get the full story.

Since I don't own any splits myself I'm not on the vintagelist. maybe
someone could cross post this message there. Might be of interest to these
guys (and gals) as well.

(who will never ever be able to do something like that himself)
