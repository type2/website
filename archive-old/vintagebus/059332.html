&gt; .  the m/c i got from the donor bus has one good spring plate, and the other 
&gt; has two tabs broken off.  

Chris,
We are just not sure what you are referring to as a spring plate in or on the 
67 MC!  Spring plate just brings to mind the rear suspension.  Can you take a 
image of the part, and post it on a website or Pmail it to us?
