Subject: more 61 progress....
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003061142560.30485-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

the last couple of weeks i have made some progress on my 61.

I have taken my wire wheel and prep sol and knocked all the chunkies out
of where the beam goes... gotten rid of all the loose flaky surface rust.

Then i went back with POR15 and coated everything that was rusty forward
of the first frame crossmember.  Well, almost... i have a bit yet left to
do on the doglegs.  But i can do that after i get the beam back in, i just
wanted to make sure to do anything thats easier with the beam removed,
front end stuff disassembled.

Except for near the gas pedal area, there werent any big holes in the
front floors, so i am going to use the POR15 sytem to fix the little
ones... some of that putty.

Tonight, i am using their tie coat primer to prep the por15 for later
painting and make it light grey instead of black...  Also i bought some
seam sealer to properly seal up all of the seams as volkswagen did from
the factory.  Any seam i removed old chunky bits of sealer from will be
getting the new 3m stuff...

I hope to do that tonight, then put the beam in tomorrow and start on
brakes.

I might build a new engine, but i currently have one engine with bad
valves and another with a bad bottom end... i might do a head transplant
so i can drive it while i build a killer reliable motor :)

more to come....

Steve

p.s. i just shaved my beard so the respirator would seal, i have given up
for now on positive pressure... i'd rather work on my bus and once its
running play with pumps and hoods :)

p.p.s. i have no afilliation with the por15 people, i just have used it on
my 71 and where i put that stuff the rust stopped.  Where i didnt, it has
continued to worsen... so my experience sez it does good.
