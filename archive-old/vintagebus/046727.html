hello, i am very new to the vintage bus list as i am prospectively looking at
a 58 single-cab pickup, just a few questions if i may
1. where can i find 6v batteries? i would like to restore and keep as stock as
possible. would golf cart 6v work?
- -  -- - 
I dont know what kind a golf cart takes, but I did get a 6V battery at Sears 
for my 53 bus.
resistance is a problem in old VWs, if you clean up all the connections 
(including in the fuse box) and grounds  on the bus you will find the lights 
are much brighter.    VeeWee111 are sold on the taking apart and cleaning up 
and reassembly of the headlight switch for bright headlights, which also 
results in the switch not getting hot.   I have not done this yet, but the 
headlight switch in my 53 gets hot  to the point I dont want to use them and 
the lights are dim, will tell you all when I do that or have a disasterous 
electrical meltdown due to procrastination and almost 50 years of corrosion.  
 They also had asked if the 54 I used to have was 12V, as the lights were so 
bright.  (no it wasn't, just  had boringly cleaned all the connections).
..............
2. where might i be able to find a bently or bently-esque manual, as i have
only worked on watercooled vws before.
-------------- - -- --
get an Idiot Book by John Muir, available at any VW shop, through the mail,  
book shops on line,   and many second hand book stores as it has been in 
print for 30 years.   (How To Keep Your Volswagen Alive, a Manual of Step by 
Step Procedures for the Compleat [sic] Idiot.   Go rent Apollo 13, and when 
they get to the Procedure part, you will see where Muir stole his idea 
from...VW s in space!!!!)  I saw one in a used bookstore for $10 the other 
day, clean even.   I am sure some one will say where to get the Bentley 
reprint of the Transporter Workshop Manual, 1963 edition,  which gives more 
info on a split that any other shop manual available today.    It will not 
cover  some stuff for a 58,  as there were changes,  (like the wiring harness 
and taillight shape) but it will help quite a lot.  This is a reprint of the 
book VW wrote and  gave to each dealership  for them to use in working on the 
buses, and is amazingly complete ...the body section is incomparable.    If 
you are wanting something more specific, you would have to find an original 
older edition.    which is more difficult, but sometimes you can find them at 
VW swaps.  The 59 edition, which is not reprinted,  was for  March 59 through 
Nov 62 buses, the 55 edition would be ideal for you if you are keeping it 
bone stock, being specific for  March 55 through April 59 buses, meaning post 
barndoors with the splitcase tranny and 36hp motor.  that 55 one is 
hardcover, not the 6 ring binder type.  
- - - - - - --- - 
3. is there any difference in front floor pannels between standard bus,
double-cab, and single-cab?
......
no, but as you have a 58, the placement of the shift stick was moved forward 
in Aug 59 at chassis 501 707, so if you are needed to replace the entire 
floor you have the difficult task of finding one from a 50s bus.    (what 
year was that cheap SF bus and did anyone get it?)  I believe the patch 
pieces available for the corners of the front floor which tend to be where it 
 rusts out are universal for 3/55 through 67 buses.

bus trucks are cool  :)
