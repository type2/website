Subject: Help with basics of fuel reserve....
Mime-Version: 1.0

So...I went to fill the tank with my 5 gallons of gas. I had got less than
a gallon in when the gas started over-flowing out of the spout! (right on
my shiney paint job). I was pretty confused. So I turned over the engine
and it fired right up and ran fine. Now, my fuel reserve cable is not
hooked up, and I'm not sure exactly where it hooks or how the reserve
works. But my guess is that I've somehow got it in the reserve setting or
something and it's just running out of gas. Does this sound right?

Does the Bentley reprint cover fuel reserve set-up? If not, could someone
give me a quick (and hopefully detailed) tutorial on how it works and what
parts should be there?

I've got the cable found underneath, but can't see ANYTHING to hook it too.
Maybe a previous owner removed the part I need. But the tank definatly
LOOKS original. Am I on the right track here, or am I getting it all wrong? 

Thanks for any help.
