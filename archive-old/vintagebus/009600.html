I have to recommend against using the PH8A... you risk ballooning,
blowouts, and general filter failure with them. They are *much* more
affordable than the Fram HP-1 filters, but they do not have the burst
capacity (and, I imagine, the flow rate) that the HP-1 does, which is
why Gene Berg wouldn't sell them with his full-flow kits. The extra
money that I pay gives me peace of mind, FWIW. I've found them here in
Knoxville for between $6.50 and $9.00 or so.

I agree.  Local guy here was showing someone his new engine for his baha bug
using a PH8A.  Temps were fairly cold, but it was raining so it wasn't all
that cold.  Revved the engine a couple times (not all that high of rpm)  and
the filter split open draining all over the street.
I've run HP1, O-berg filters in winter with temps around zero F with no
problem  except the price.  Last time I got HP1s a few weeks ago Checker had
them for around $5.  I wanted to buy a few, but they only stock 2 a week or
something like that.
