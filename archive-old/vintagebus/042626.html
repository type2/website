hi all,

i have decided to plan a fall campout the weekend before thanksgiving.
Sorry for the late notice but i think it'll be a lot of fun :)

i couldnt think of a name, but maybe &quot;are you crazy enough to go camping
in the middle of november&quot; or something like that...  here is an
opportunity to prove your mettle as a bus-nut... 

The campout will be located at Cuivre River State park... in Troy Missouri
the park is northwest of saint louis about 45 minutes/1 hour... convenient
to kansas city springfield and st. louis... but not too far from anywhere
:)  I must warn you all that the showers/toilets will be turned off and
we'll have to use primitive facilities... can you take it? (pit toilets
and water only at one central location.)

camping fees are $5 per site for non-electric and $10-11 per site for
electric.(space heater??)  Doubling up is permitted so if you have a buddy
to share with it'd be as little as $2.50 a person.  I will be there after
work on friday (around 6) but anyone wanting to arrive earlier feel free,
just look for busses when you get there...

for more info and phone numbers:

to get there from st louis:

take i-70 west 21.6 miles
take US-61 north 14.7 miles
Take the MO-47 ramp towards TROY/WINFIELD
turn left onto SR-47
go 3 miles east of Troy on Hwy. 47 in Lincoln County.

to get there from Kansas City:

take i-70 east 
take US-61 north 14.7 miles
Take the MO-47 ramp towards TROY/WINFIELD
turn left onto SR-47
go 3 miles east of Troy on Hwy. 47 in Lincoln County.  

thanks and let me know if you think you might come, it'll be nice to know
i wont be alone in the woods :)

peas,

Steve

p.s. feel free to forward this post to any other mailing list/person who
might be interested.(dbg??)
