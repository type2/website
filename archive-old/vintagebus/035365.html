Subject: Broken brake bleeder valve
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Need the lists advice on a broken bleeder valve. The nipple on my left rear 
wheel is broken off past the point of no return. I need to bleed my brakes. 
Can I just have this bored out and retapped? What happens if I just bleed and 
adjust the remaining 3 brakes. It makes me sick to think that I will need to 
get this to the shop to get machined out. Help!!!!
