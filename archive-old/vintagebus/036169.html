&lt;&lt;  I know.
  
  A 185 tire is aproximatly 185mm across at the widest point of its bulge,
  unloaded, mounted on the &quot;optimal&quot; size rim.;)
  
  What i was saying is that i dont have the metric (mm) to standard (inches)
  conversion formula on hand to get the exact (aprox) dimension...I never
  can remember it, and the calculator i had that does it is dead.
  
  Of course, all of that varies from manufactures to manufactures, as well
  as model to model.
  
 ============================================================ 
  
  As far as I can remeber there are 2.54 cm per inch so that'd be 25.4 mm per 
inch.  We all occasionally have to use our 13mm wrenches on 1/2&quot; bolts right? 
 so if calculating this in my head (and keep in mind it's clogged and 
dripping snot like there's no tomorrow) 1 &quot; =  25.4mm so 1/2&quot; = 0.5*25.4 = 
12.7&quot; which is roughly 13mm
 
 continuing this...
 
 185mm = 7.28&quot;
 195mm = 7.67&quot;
 205mm = 8.07&quot;
 
 I think 205 (205/75/15) is the biggest tire you can run with uncut wheel 
wells, but (and we've been over this a thousand times) it's easier to find 
the Loch Ness monster than it is to find a nice 8 ply, reinforced sidewall, 
C/D rated tire.  
 
 If the original poster is looking for a better handling bus and is looking 
towards tires to aid in that, 14&quot; are the way to go.
