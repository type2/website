Subject: RE: [VB] Bad-word, BAD-word

Reverse is one all by itself and is the only one I would attempt to change.
Just don't set the throw to much as the gears will hit. Ask me at OCTO.

PS. drove the frankingfrugly truck out the shop door last night. Am have
fuel problems so I am setting up a gravity feed fuel tank to the carb of the
awesome OPEL  engine (don't ask, you just have to see to believe)

Subject: [VB] Bad-word, BAD-word


So the non-stock type 1 IRS tranny in the'63 DC won't 
stay in 4 and is leaking bad from the right hip socket. 
Pick up a nice '70 AH tranny from the local salvage yard 
to replace it. Pull the engine and see a sleeved shaft 
on the '70 AH tranny in the DC, the 'new' tranny is 
bare. Bad-word. Buy a new pressure plate. Get a nosecone 
gasket at noon yesterday and go home to put it all 
together. Hmmm, transaxle that was at working height on 
the big plastic garbage can is now on the driveway 
cement. BAD-word. Karl comes by to not bring me some 
fuel line and we try to put the forks in neutral to 
install the nosecone. Reverse has become a theft 
protection feature, it won't move unless a long crowbar 
is applied. The tranny fell on the actuator and bent it. 
Pried the seal off the shaft and installed it on the old 
tranny. Will finish the job tonight on the hottest day 
this year for the Classic trip and hope it holds 
together with the thicker GL4 while I try and replace 
the actuators. 
Is is beyond the skill of the mortals to replace the 
actuators? Anybody know the procedure in 5,000 words or 
less? Or do I start looking for another cheap and 
plentiful T1 transaxle?
