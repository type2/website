I can add further support of the vacuum/centrifugal advance distributors.  I
have been running one that I found in a boneyard and rebuilt for a year or
so after driving 009 equipped engines in the years before that.  The
difference in drivability is immediately noticeable.

Another improvement that is slightly non-stock is the addition of a
Pertronix Ignitor and a CDI module.  I'll spare the details, which Mr.
Hoover covered in a very well written post to RAMVA (do a Deja search for
&quot;Re: Capacitive discharge ignitions--info requested&quot;, 24 Sept. 1999), but
this upgrade resulted in an even more noticeable improvement!  There's a
noticeable increase in power, and the engine smoothed out across the entire
RPM range.  Starts on the first crank and idles steadily right away.  I had
to adjust the idle speed down so far that the bypass screw nearly bottomed
out (34 PICT-3)!  The Kombi really purrs now.  This is a very worthwhile
upgrade for any daily-driven bus IMHO.  Even works on buses with 3 degrees
of positive front wheel camber!  ;-)

&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Also installed the Aircooled_dot_com vacuum advance 009 dist. that was in VW
&gt; Trends today. Been setting on the bench for a couple of weeks. Talked to
the
&gt; Aircooled_dot_com guys at BOR and learned a few things. They say 3 to 4 MPG
gain
&gt; off the bat. Got 20.4 to and from Phoenix with full load and single wheel
&gt; trailor running 60 MPH +-. Will check MPG to and from KP and see what I
get.
&gt; Will report back. It this thing works it will pay for itself in 1 or 2
&gt; trips. 1st trip around the block was great, lost the 009 flat spot off
idle
&gt; and seemed to pull better up the hill
