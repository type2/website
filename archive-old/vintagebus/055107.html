Subject: RE: [VB] LEAKING TRANNY

&gt;No washer, the drain plugs go into a hole that gets narrower as it goes
inward. So if you over tighten it, you could crack the tranny case. 

Also it is a good practice to clean the threads out very well before
reinstalling the plugs.  

For some reason my tranny plugs all were covered in schmigma that was hard
as a rock to get out of the threads.  I used a table mounted 5&quot; wire wheel
to clean the threads out, very nice tool to have.  The plugs came out
looking brand new!...  Well except that one the PO decided to remove with
vise-grips :(  luckily still usable though.   

Also I learned that the Brazilian swing axle boot kits contain o-clamps that
are worthless!  Under the stresses of use they pull apart and break, leaving
your tranny fluid to leak out of the boot.  I went back to my packrat shelf
and put on the original German 30some year old ones back on, which still
work perfectly.

I agree with Everett, try the Teflon tape.  It is very inexpensive at Home
Depot (less than a $1), but not at the FLAPS.


Good luck,
