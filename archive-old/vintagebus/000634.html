 YEs; you also need to strip some of the paint, and then leave it
 parked either in the PNW during the Rain Festival (Jan 1st - Dec 31st)
 so you get some good rust streaking.  Hack the front beam up, too.
 
 Sure the speedwell beastie rides like new; a new Cat T8 maybe...

Hey Thom, it doesn'r rain the entire time here, it was really dry this summer 
actually and must have been weeks and weeks without any at all.

Anyway, you could always park your bus downwind of an acid rain producing 
factory.   Good for making that surface rust patina.
