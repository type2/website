Hey Thom,
Check out about the forth guy down on the petition, Neil Pickett, says he has an original '55 workshop manual that he would make available for use as a reference.  This could be useful for your guy at Bentley.
     Considering the speciality nature of the books, I don't think that $105 bucks is unreasonable, after all, this is Bentley Publishing were talking about here, not Joe Shmoe Shadtree publishers.
     As far as a CD Rom, I would rather have a book, with the CD Rom packaged in it like many computer reference books. Check out this scenario, your doing the brakes on your 61 kombi, with your nice new manual out, when suddenly brake fluid leaks all over your investment! Ruined? Hah, just go inside and print out a new page from your well protected CD.
Just my thoughts.
Jon
