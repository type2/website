Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

You are right, I did forget to mention that part.

I ducted the air off the doghouse cooler out the back of the bus. You can
use the regular 1 7/8&quot; silver aluminum hose to duct it. The amount of air
flowing through the doghouse oil cooler is very minimal.

&gt; &gt; So I pulled the tin from the motor that straddled where the engine and
trans
&gt; &gt; meet and repeated the test. I had to get just inches away from the
louvers
&gt; &gt; before it pulled the shop towel toward the louvers.
&gt;
&gt; thats a bad tin to pull from a doghouse though because the hot air dumped
&gt; through the cooler to the front of the engine will be pulled back in
&gt; rather than passing under and out.
