 the singing mechanic suggested that i put a paper air cleaner in place of
 the old oil bath for the winter months because of the oil in the bath
 freezing up. do any of you have any thoughts/suggestions?
  &gt;&gt;

remember= change the oil in the oil bath every 3000 miles- at every oil 
change, and clean the gurk/dirt out.   oil freezing?  is the oil in your 
engine freezing?   Oil bath helps the pre heat too, paper filters are garbage
