&gt; I think maybe your problem is not electrical.  From
&gt; 1885, when cars
&gt; first existed, to about 1985-1990, when it became
&gt; economical for
&gt; people to have a TV and VCR in their cars, kids took
&gt; long trips in
&gt; cars without the benefit of video.  They took part
&gt; in now-obscure
&gt; pastimes such as looking out the windows,..&lt;&lt;

Oh Matt, you have obviously never driven 10 hours to a
bus campout in North Carolina (from Ohio) with a 10,
4, and 2 year old!!  Remember when you were a kid, how
long did it take you to get bored with &quot;I Spy&quot; and
looking out the window? I remember being bored about
30 minutes into the trip.  That's about the time I
started poking my little brother and holding my finger
about 1\8 inch from his face saying &quot;I'm not touching
you!!&quot; Then he'd do that trick where he farted in his
hand and threw it at me. These are the games I
remember!!
I just can't yell as well as my Dad could, so I see
this as a peaceful solution for those long trips,
don't worry the TV\VCR will not turn on unless it is
at least a 2 hour trip ;^)

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
