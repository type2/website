&gt; I'm in the process of buying a different house.  This one will have some
&gt; space for a shop off the ally.  I should think 3 bays plus some
&gt; parking.  I'd like some input on what people like about their shops or
&gt; wish they had or had built when they had the chance.  I'm in Southern
&gt; CA, so heating and air are not major concerns, storage, space, and
&gt; efficiency are though.  What do you like about your shop....don't
&gt; like???
&gt;
&gt; Questions like lift or pit or both?  Roll up or swing out doors?
&gt; Separate work shop from main work bays?  Upstairs storage or storage in
&gt; an underground area or a outside shed?  Air of course, but what type of
&gt; pipe?  How much power?  8 foot or 4 foot lights? ect.
&gt;
&gt; Any input will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

You will definitely need a live-in workshop manager.

When can I move in?

 (well, you said &quot;any input&quot;)  :)
