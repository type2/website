The point is, you CAN NOT &quot;push&quot; a stock setup beyond the
&quot;safe&quot; limit in 4th gear. I don't know why your engine gave
up, but it was not because you went to fast in 4th gear;&lt;)

&gt; Never said I was trying to run WOT.  :)  That's why I only go about 60mph
&gt; and not 65.  I pushed a Bus engine once and it twasn't pretty!  That was
&gt; before I knew better.  Now I just get in the slow lane, relax, and laugh at
&gt; all the Bay Area people who are rushing to get places.
