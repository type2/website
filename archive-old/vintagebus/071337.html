Subject: RE: Restorations, rebuilds, customs and DNA

Its YOUR car !!! Build it the way YOU like it.  Never worry about what other
people think !! &quot;they&quot; have been ragging on my two VWs for years--Herbey and
Bessie--With all the accessories on them-- Funny how when I go to a NON-VW
show Everyone loves my VWs !! Yet at a VW show  -- the &quot;know-it-alls&quot;
continue to rip my VWs-- Bessie right now is doing her 2nd movie appearance,
right here in Phoenix--
The &quot;Bikers&quot; that were hired for the movie, love Bessie--in fact we had to
have pictures taken all together--Sometime a lot of people take the VW
Hobby, WAY to serious--Drive your VW and enjoy it--Remember YOU are building
the car for YOU--Not for some &quot;Know-it all&quot;,
Who has nothing better to do then rip other peoples rides--
