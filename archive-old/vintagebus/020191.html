From: Matthew Henricks &lt;mjhenks_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
Subject: A few bus question (65 Samba)
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Anyone have any info on the following:

My seatbelts are a bit worse for wear.  Both teh
webbing and the chrome pieces.  Can the webbing be
bought and re-stitched?  anyone have a source?

What are you all using for rear bumper splash pan
seals?

who has the best price on OEM round outside mirrors? 
(Not the repro's, i already have these and am very
unhappy with them)

What have you found works to keep TMI's sun visors (65
padded type) in place.  Mine want to travle down into
my face all the time.  Very irritating.

Anyone have any first hand knowledge with westfalia
tow bars for type 1's.  (email me off list for this
one)  i need some info on compatability for pre 68 and
post 68 units.

thanks for the help.
Matthew
