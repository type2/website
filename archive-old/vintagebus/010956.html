&gt;I've been giving this some thought, actually.  Beyond the minor detail
&gt;of cost (hey, that's what the lottery's for), can anyone think of a
&gt;good reason *not* to do this?

I am also a big fan of the Shiny Black Stuff(Por 15)but it is intended to be
applied under paint onto the metal. It's like black superglue. While working 
on the Batmobile I got some of the Por 15 overlapping onto some primer. 
It peeled like cheap latex 8( If you are going to paint over it be sure 
to primer it while it is still tacky.
