&quot;This was taken last week in Waldorf by a Transportation Supervisor for
a
company that delivers building materials for 84 Lumber.  When he saw it
there in the parking lot of IHOP, he went and bought a camera to take
pictures.

The car is still running as can be witnessed by the exhaust. A woman is
either asleep or otherwise out in the front seat passenger side.  The
guy driving it was over jogging up and down on Rt. 925 in the
background.

The witnesses said their physical state was OTHER than normal and the
police just shook their heads in amazement.  The driver finally came
back after
the police were there and was getting down at the back to cut the twine
around the load.  They told him to get back until it was taken off.

The materials were loaded at Home Depot.  Their store manager said they
had the customer sign a waiver!  Both back tires are trashed.  The back
shocks were driven up through the floorboard.  In the back seat are are
10
bags, 80 lbs. each of concrete.  On the roof is many 2X4s, 4X4s and OSL
sheets of lumber.  They estimated the load weight at 3000 lbs.  The car
is a VW
Jetta with FL plates and the guy said he was headed for Annapolis.  JUST

UNBELIEVABLE!!!! &quot;
