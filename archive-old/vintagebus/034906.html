&lt;&lt; How does one extract the stub end that is now nestled neatly in the crank 
without bunging up the end if the crank????? &gt;&gt;
Hi Nate &amp; Denia,
Any machine shop should have a large easy out to remove it for you.  This 
would be a OK way to do it because of the large diameter size makes it a low 
risk of breaking off.  Unless you get a complete dolt to do the job!
Otherwise you could have someone with a wirefeed welder weld a piece of flat 
stock to the remains and turn them out that way.
Most likely you could do it yourself with a hammer, and center punch.  Just 
use these tools to convince the remains of the gland bolt to turn 
couterclockwise.
