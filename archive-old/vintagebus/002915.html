Sounds interesting, I might know someone. Where is it Damon?? RHD? Kombi?
As I'm sure most people on the list would agree, you can't have too many
projects sitting in your garden!!

By the way, it's interesting to read the magazine debate going on with the
American listees, as there is a bit of a debate in the UK as to the quality
and rivalry between some of the mags. The more the merrier in my view!!!

&gt; Of interest to Brits mainly...
&gt; A friend of mine has run out of cash on a restoration. Looking at the
pics,
&gt; he's replaced almost the entire floor, Schofield panels all over, there
&gt; must be a pound of Schofield stickers on the thing...  The floor itself
&gt; isn't there yet, bitten off more than he could chew it seems. I expect
&gt; he'll want to offload cheap. It's a '57 from Portugal, Safaris (condition
&gt; unknown) It must owe him at least 1500 quid.
&gt; I can get his number if anyones interested.
