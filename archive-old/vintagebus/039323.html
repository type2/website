Steve, 

John is right. The AE case, all things being equal, is a far superior case. It has larger oil passages, dual pressure relief valves, and is made of a better allow of magnesium than the H case. Since you're not building a stock engine, count your blessings and carry on. 

You wouldn't, in my opinion, want to build an H case up as you have described. The H case was designed for the smaller oil cooler, and even though the doghouse cooler can be retrofitted to the H case, you'll never get the full benefit because your oil passages in the case are smaller.

BTW, the AE case was intended for dual-port heads. I don't think it makes any difference to the case, but I would consider going back to DP heads. I *believe*, but do not know for sure, that they will give you better power and better cooling of the heads (equalling longer life).

If you're absolutely crazy and insist on going to an H case, let me talk to you about a trade. I have a good running H case with less than 2,000 miles on it in my bus. I'd much rather have an AE case...of course, my wife would be pissed if I started on another rebuild right now. ;)

Good luck! Joe
