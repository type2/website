Subject: Re: [VB] Truck Rear View Mirror?
References: &lt;3B04BF6E.47D54B1E_at_qwest_dot_net&gt;

We have a &quot;baby mirror&quot; from Target, for mothers to check on the child
somewhere in the car. It has a suction cup that sticks on. It does fall
off, maybe once a month at most.  depends on heat and how clean the
glass was.  We did not want to drill holes in our panel/camper either. 
Only down part is the convex design which makes things in the rear
window a little small, but you can see cars/trucks behind you etc. Could
not find a flat one with the suction cup.

Considered hanging off the airvent plate but it was too far to the rear
to be useful and concerns about hitting it because we have the walk
thru.

Also looking at using one of the stick on mirrors like they use as an
add-on mirror for blind spots to enhance viewing.

P &amp; C
59 ddr w/t with 65 EZ camper off and running again to Del Mar for a week
for a rally and SV2 club bus work weekend.


 
&gt; My 1960 Double cab does not have a rear view mirror--But i would like to install
&gt; one--Without drilling any holes--I understand it was a dealer install--Was thinking of
&gt; using one of the screws that holds the fresh airvent plate to hold a mirror?
