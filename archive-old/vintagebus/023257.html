I don't see what issues the greenies would have with the dishwasher idea.
I think it's a dang site better than a) chemdip b) carb cleaner in the
driveway

The best parts cleaning solution I've had - which could be extrapolated to
engine cases with the right bits - was a small harbor frieght parts cleaner
with a small amount with laquer thinner.  I sealed the lid with  good
quality, closed-cell weatherstripping, and duct-taped the holes in the
sides.  The vapors *alone* will strip an emblem to bare metal in a few
hours!  2 days stripped an old tranny nosecone to near-nos condition.

The secret - you don't have to immerse the part - the vapors will work as
well or better, if you trap them in there with it!  Seal it up and let it
stew.  Caution: it's going to stink real bad when you open it!

&gt;Good ideas Thom!  I already have a dish washer and when I used it to wash
&gt;parts with and announced it to the list, I was promptly knocked of my
&gt;pedestal by project greenworthy.  It seems I offended some pro-bio people.
&gt;Now I just wash my parts in secret.
