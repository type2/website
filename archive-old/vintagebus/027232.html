Bubbles in the paint filled with water. . .

My bet is it is from your compressor. You probably don't have a moisture
trap. The water builds up in the line and final rolls into the paint.

That is the reason, when doing airbrush work, I use a CO2 tank. The
&quot;air&quot; is completely dry. Even a moisture trap with sometimes let water
by and, when doing airbrush, it will cause it to spit. and that is the
last thing I need because fixing it takes so much time.

But, of course, you cannot use CO2 for painting cars.
