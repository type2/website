Subject: re:tires at Vallejo show

Roger Nang posted:

I was at the VW show in Vallejo, CA yesterday and passed up the
chance to purchase two **NEW** wolfsburg mud and snow tires for the bus.

They were 7.14 x 14 biasply tires labeled WOLFSBURG and made in the
U.S.A.

The guy who had the tires is a good friend of mine.  So if you are
interested I would be happy to pass on your name and number to him.  I
do not know if he still has them or not.  He did say that they are still
available to get two more to complete a set.
