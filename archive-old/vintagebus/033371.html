&lt;&lt; With the brakes nearly done, I was looking today at the new and old heater 
boxes I have for my '64 Standard.  The right new one is Dansk and the left 
new one is VW.  Both old ones appear to be aftermarket; no internal ribs on 
the exhaust pipe and no &quot;VW&quot; stamp.
On the right old one, the long lever that has the cable connection at one end 
and the short lever for the flap at the other end is retained in the center 
by an E-clip in a groove on the pivot shaft. The new one has the pivot shaft, 
but no groove in the end.  Do I file a groove into it, or is there some other 
way that this lever is retained?&gt;&gt;
|Hi Matt,
Sounds like you will need to do some filing!
 
&lt;&lt;Also, on the right old one, there is a torsion spring around the center 
pivot.  One end bears on the lever and the other end goes into a small hole 
in the heater box casing.  The new one doesn't have a hole...is there any 
reason why I shouldn't just carefully drill one?&gt;&gt;
Drill away!
 
&lt;&lt;On the left side it gets more interesting.  The small lever for the flap 
comes out on the wrong side.  Also, there is no pivot shaft for the middle of 
the big lever.  There's a flat spot for it, but no shaft.  Can I flip the 
small lever/flap axle around if I take apart the control box?  Is there a 
standard part/kit for putting the pivot shaft on a non-pivot-shaft box? &gt;&gt;
Does not sound like it.  What you describe sounds like it is designed for 
1968-71 bus and we do not know how one can rig those to really work with the 
pre-1968 bus heating system other than just wiring that one side open all the 
time or cutting off the sheetmetal skin and doing the same to an earlier 
model hear box and fitting welding the skin from that onto the new heater box 
J-tube.   Eric&amp;Barb
