Subject: Re: [VB] Forsale 69 bug

It has a leaky main seal, a dented front left fender, and the master
cylinder is shot. Runs though. I have a bus that I need to devote my time
and money on, so this thing has to go. It is located in Seattle.

Thanks,
Justin C&lt;&gt;

Subject: RE: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto


&gt;   I have more then 50 hours alone into the just the undercarriage of my
DC.
&gt; The time included removing everything from the undercarriage, spending
&gt; countless hours wire brushing it, then taping off what I didn't want
&gt; sprayed, rust morting the under carriage, then painting it. This time does
&gt; not include any rust repair (none was needed) or straightening anything. I
&gt; now have a completely painted under carriage and figure another 100 plus
&gt; hours in rebuilding and painting the front end and trans, doing the
brakes,
&gt; wiring harness etc. That puts just the undercarriage alone at $7500.00
&gt; dollars labor not counting any parts or materials. Thank god my labor is
&gt; free (or is it). Then I will add the estimated 300 hours in body work
(again
&gt; no rust repair or metal replacement) that adds another $15,000 in body and
&gt; paint, again not counting materials.
&gt;   Then I have upholstery and interior stuff, that should be cheap I figure
&gt; $1000.00 dollars for that.
&gt;   So all in all I figure I will have at least $25000.00 or so in my DC, it
&gt; should be nice though and I would be lucky to sell it for $10,000.00 when
&gt; it's done.
&gt;   But at least I know I won't have probably 1/3 of what Dave has in his 59
!
&gt;
&gt; Ronnie  it'll be done some day
&gt;
&gt; ps. all bassed on an average of 50 dollars an hour
&gt; pps; and it's not going to be VN stock

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have never paid for a full on restoration but a close friend of mine
&gt; just got a bid on his 67 Double Cab and I was going to see if any of you
&gt; had some input on cost and maybe some other places he should look into.
&gt; He has all of the welding completed and the quote is for sandblasting
&gt; and then POR 15 the whole double cab and then bodywork and primer. The
&gt; bodywork is the smoothing process not welding in major panels as that
&gt; has been done already. The quote was for $4700. This would still need a
&gt; good paint job on top of that number. It seems a little high to me since
&gt; I know this guy is not looking for a show truck just a really nice
&gt; driver. Anyone have any recommendations for shops in the Seattle area? I
&gt; would bet he would be willing to go as far as Portland OR if there was a
&gt; good shop for the right price. He has more money than time, with two
&gt; little kids and a more than full time job so you can skip the learn to
&gt; do it yourself advice. We have done a couple together and I know he does
&gt; not want to go that way this time.
&gt; thanks in advance,
