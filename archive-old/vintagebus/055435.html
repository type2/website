Subject: Re: [VB] Automatic Choke Question

Whoa! The autochoke, as it heats up, should OPEN the upper butterfly,
not close it. That's what you meant, right?

I've heard stories of a manual choke carb still in production. Is this
carb any good?

Subject: [VB] Automatic Choke Question


...This afternoon I disconnected the automatic choke so the ceramic
heater
doesn't warm up and close the butterfly valve.  Drove it around just
fine.  Parked, reconnected the automatic choke and within a minute it
died at idle.  It goes without saying that I'd prefer not to drive
around with the choke on....
