Subject: [VB] Re: 15&quot; Wheels

I stand corrected.

The 15&quot; bus wheel is 4.5&quot; wide.

The 14&quot; bus wheel is 5.5&quot; wide. 

Verified this at Dave Easterwood's house last night.  He had a set of each
nicely redone and powder coated waiting on completed busses to put them on
:)  Threw a measuring stick on them and that was that.

...  Granted you can still run 215/75/15s on them...  Just looks like BIG
tires :)
