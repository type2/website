Subject: Zorm's still not running right - no power.

ARRRG!  I'm running out of ideas here.  I've fixed all the stupid things
(like #2,#4 plug wires swapped), but still can't get this thing to run
right.

Here's the problem:  In the driveway, the engine sounds and runs great.
Idles smooth at 900 rpm, revs easily to 4000 rpm.  When I take it for a
test drive, it's VERY sluggish.  Feels like it can't get out of it's own
way.  Going up the very mild hill in front of my house (the kind of hill
that a bicyclist doesn't break a sweat on), I can't even get up to
30mph.  For all the world, it feels like the thing is running on 2 or 3
cylinders.  With patience, I can get up to 3000 rpms for the shift to
each gear, but it doesn't matter how long I keep my foot on the gas, it
just won't get much past that.  When I get impatient and push the gas
pedal to the floor, the tone of the engine changes and sounds like it is
spluttering.

Setup:  1776 with new p&amp;c, reground stock cam, counterweighted crank.
New Brazilian heads with 39mm intake, 32mm exhaust, combustion chamber
ground out to accomodate bigger valves (what's the term for that?), and
cc'ed.  7.4-1 compression ratio.  Stock rockers, reground lifters.  009
distributor set for 30 degrees max advance.  Used, untried dual baby
Webers (34 ICT's).

Things I've checked:  Compression is 150 psi across the board.  Swapped
all 4 plugs and wires with no change.  Swapped 009 dist for another,
known good one complete with points and condensor - no change.  With the
engine running at 2200 rpms, I pulled each plug wire in sequence and
noted an appropriate drop in engine speed for all 4.  All valves are set
at .006.  Carbs are balanced at idle and balance holds true up to at
least 2600 rpm (that's as high as my synchrometer will read them),
balance tube connected, checked for intake leaks and found none.

At this point, I can't think of anything I haven't checked.  My only
thoughts are that the carbs are junk.  I'm loathe to remove them and
re-install my old 34pict because it wasn't working that great on my old
engine, but it's starting to look like that's the only thing left.

Any suggestions?  Anything obvious I'm overlooking?

Thanks.
