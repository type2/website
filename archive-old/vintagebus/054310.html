Subject: Re: [VB] Vehicle registration in Calif

well, you could go in with the vin numer to get the statement of how much back fees are owed. if there are slot, the eassiest and best way to do it ( ive dont this,its a good loophole) is to sell it to a junkyard and buy it right back from them. that is only if there are ALOT of back fees..like if it was sitting without a non op. my 62 had 300 in back fees- i sold it to a pick and pull (for 200 bucks) and bouaght it back for 250. then you get a clean salvagfe title.
