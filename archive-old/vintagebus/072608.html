Subject: Re: [VB] 21 window shirt

I figured it was one of those. I do hope no one near me gets it though.
Those cats are out every weekend taking up half the road and If I saw

Wonder if the Germans knew they invented the first solar oven with the 21
window bus?
I worked for an Olds Dealer back in 1962 and the Olds vista cruiser could
cook raw hamberger in about an hour in the Texas sun.
