Subject: Closeout Deal on Sheet Metal, Exhaust, &amp; More!

Importance: Normal

I have a few closeouts that just arrived which I can offer special
Listmember pricing on.  Please note that these are special Listmember deals,
so when ordering you MUST specify that you're a listmember to get these
prices.

Sheet Metal - this was a purchase of bankrupt stock from a European
distributor (although it is actually Brazilian made). A VERY minor dot of
surface rust here or there on a handful of them, but nothing that a piece of
steel wool wouldn't get rid of in just a few minutes.  Prices are about 50%
off of my already-discounted prices.  Quantities are limited, so first come
first serve.

Rear lower corner, left or right (our part # 211 813 355X)  Was $25.95, now
$12.95
Battery tray, right (our part # 95 50 690)  Was $24.95, now $12.95
Outer rocker panel, right (part # 95 50 022)  Was $16.95, now $7.95
Inner rocker panel, left or right (part # 88512)  Was $18.95, now $8.95
Front outrigger, left or right (part # 95 50 790)  Was $15.95, now $7.95
Rear outrigger, left or right (part # 95 50 810)  Was $16.95, now $8.95
Front jacking point, left (part # 88508)  Was $17.95, now $8.95
Front jacking point, right (part # 88509)  Was $17.95, now $8.95

Carbs
I have 4 Genuine Volkswagen (Brazil) 30 pict carbs for single-port engine,
manual choke. $99.95 each (113 129 027K).

Mufflers
I have German 40HP Stale-Air Mufflers (211 251 053C) for $59.95 each, and
40HP Fresh-Air Mufflers (211 251 053J) for $39.95 each.  About 7 of each, no
more when they're gone.

Heat Exchangers
I have Danish 1200-1600 cc (fresh air) heat exchangers (the heavy duty ones,
not the flimsy &quot;econo&quot; ones that some of the mail order places in the VW
mags sell) for $74.95 each.  Part number 043 255 107H (left) or 043 255 108H
(right).
I also have N.O.S. genuine VW German right side heat exchangers for $99.95
(part # 043 255 108HG). This is a great deal on a serious heat exchanger.
However, unlike the Danish ones, these N.O.S. ones have the '68-71 bus
linkage on them, which means that to make them work with your heater lever
you'd have to fabricate a tab for the cable to connect to (or just wire it
open if you're in a cold region); the actual heater box is the same, only
the linkage is different.

Heads
And finally, I have the &quot;German&quot; 1600 dual-port heads mentioned on the list
the other day (complete heads; genuine VW/Brazil head with German components
installed).  $99.95 each (part #  043 101 355CK ).

Again, be sure to specify your list membership&quot; to get these prices. You can
order toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT, or via the website.  (Any items not yet
on the website will be added tomorrow.)  This is first come, first serve,
and prices may go up as quantities near depletion.
