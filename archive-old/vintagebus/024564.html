Subject: FS: '65 Camper in OR

Hi all-

A friend of mine would like to sell her bus and has asked me to pass the
info along to ya'll. I have recently been to see this bus on the hopes
of buying it for myself... however, circumstances have changed since
then and I no longer am able to add one more to my 'herd' of Volksies. 

Basic Elements: 
*all work identified as 'recently' done is w/in 2yrs (20K mi - I'm
pretty certain but you can check w/ owner)*

1965 American Conversion Camper - very likely EZ Camper
M codes:425 002 025 043 116, 2112 3833883 &lt;delete serial#&gt;

Mechanical Stuff:
1600 AH series recently installed w/ paperwork
Solid running
Brakes recently *completely* overhauled w/ new lines, etc..
Tranny sounded good on test drive - no difficulites shifting nor any
weak spots

Body stuff:
Velvet Green over velvet green (paint in good cond)
Split bench seat (mesh grey)
Body work done by  p.p.o.- new foot wells
Dozen small paint blisters on pass side by rear cargo door
Rust localized to side cargo doors &amp; doorway - entire door assembly
needed new rubber &amp; was never taken care of. The rest of the body is
amazingly clean, especially the undercarriage.

Electrical:
Starter a bit weak
Everything else fine

Interior:
Seats in good condition (brown vinyl) w/ few tears.
Wood paneling in fair condition (some peeling on back cabinets)
Missing inside paneling in cab area (firewall and doors)
Original tile lineoleum in fair cond.
'Refrig' unit in good cond.
Fold out table tops in good cond.
No spice rack(utility shelf) 

Misc:
Sapphire radio
Original tent in good cond

I have .jpg's of the bus that clearly show it's condition (ea. jpg is
under 30K), just ask me to send them to you.
This is a particularly nice bus that I am loathe to share, but I guess
I'll be helpful.

Contact owner about price, location, etc..

-have a good day, 
Melissa
