Subject: Re: [VB] Cargo door handle

&gt; We do not know if the later tumbler will fit at all, but if you want the 
&gt; later key to work properly you need the later suffixed handle for it to work. 
&gt; The earlier used pins going only one way where the &quot;T&quot; and later keys have 
&gt; pins going two ways to make it much more difficult to pick the lock.  
&gt; Fortunitly the later E handle is probably the easiest to find of the pre-1968 
&gt; bus handles.

Thanks for the reply.  Are 66 and 67 keys different?  My drivers door and engine lid lock are different to the other locks - slightly longer keys and appear to be VW but aren't the cutout VW sign.
Would a barrel from a 66 lock fit in a 67 door handle?  I have got a NOS engine lid lock on the way so the only bad handle is the cargo handle, and the lock on the drivers door is of a different style but I think must of been NOS when it was fitted 6 years ago.

Thanks
Paul
