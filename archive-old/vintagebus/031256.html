Subject: I Pushed my Bus!!

Monday--Phoenix---Temp a &quot;Cool&quot; 107---After driving my 1960DC around town doing various
errands--and testing the rebuilt carb--everything seemed fine--Then --my last stop was the
drive -thru bank--After making the deposit--I turned the key to start and the motor hardly
turned over and then just quit!! Battery dead?  i tried again same thing--turned over, but
no start and , just quit and died! Called Magoo--Bring jumper cables--hooked up jumper
cables from the A*tro--Still would not start--samething--turned over and then quit??--So
after just less then two months after hip replacement --I put Magoo into the DC and
Push--Nothing--Try again and i push--&quot;Rudy&quot; now finally starts!! So --no power to
starter--The battery was just tested and is fine!  What the heck--Must be starter or
starter bushing?  Starter bushing was the problem--A nice work out on blacktop parking lot
--no shade and 107 what ever degrees and a healing new hip replacement!! --Why do we do
this to ourselves?--Well &quot;Rudy&quot; is now just fine--Question now is--Which old Splittie
should i drive today??
TWWM, uj
