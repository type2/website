Just finished pulling my engine and changing alternator, amazing how guiet
my engine is now. This was done in record time of just a little over 1 hour.
R/R  bumper, rear valance and engine. Swapping alternators, installing new
fan and hub and reinstalling it all, now I'm down the road with lights.
Should role into Firebird around 10;30 PM, will be in the gravel lot, east
of the track.
