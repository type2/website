Subject: [VB] this has gone to far , isn't the customer always right
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 2000 08:44:36 -0800

Can't help it, one more:

I've dealt with many suppliers over the 15+ years I've been restoring my
cars as a hobby.  I have not found one company, not one, that I have been
happy with every single time.  Everything from items not being exactly what
I ordered, not complete, not for my car, etc.

I also work with the public, and can concur that &quot;the customer is always
right&quot; is not a license for the customer to do whatever they want, without
responsibility.  I also own two businesses, and in this state find that it
is impossible to please every customer.  And, like Ron says, sometimes you
do mess up.  You hope to be able to make everything right, but no matter how
hard you try, some people are just as happy to be upset with you and tell
about it, rather than allow you to set it straight.

We have a unique group of people, and we're all different, different skills,
different goals, different attitudes.  We need to try to work within this
and realize we're all here for the same reason: to keep our Volksies on the
road so we can enjoy them, and hopefully to preserve the feeling we get
while doing so for others to experience.
