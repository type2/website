Hi, just back from Prescott.  Hope everybody had a good time, I sure did!

It was my first trip &quot;anywhere&quot; in my 62, and my first real highway miles
on my new 1600DP BAP motor.  According to the gauge it got pretty warm
back there, and I'd appreciate opinions.

I have a VDO gauge, the sender is tapped into the case on the bottom.
My gauge reads 120-180-210-250-300, usually hangs around in the 210
range in town.  It got to 250 at the top of the hill, I stopped at the
rest area (sunset pt.) and touched the dipstick, no bandages required,
but I would have wanted a rag or an oven mitt to check the oil (which
it's not consuming yet).

Oh yeah, allow me to deliver an anti-testimonial about BAP.

They put a little tag on the block, with a drop of solder in the center.
Block gets to oh, 225, solder melts, warranty void.  Well, guess that
frees me to change whatever I want to on my motor, since compliance
for warranty purposes is no longer an issue!  I don't think there's any
way up that hill without getting just as hot as I did today.  Now I'm
almost tempted to drive like a maniac and see how hot I can get it...
If it melts down I'm putting the old 1641 that came out of it - back in...

Then again, I don't know my head temps, nor do I know what kind of
temperatures lead to actual damage...  It was 89 degrees today on I-17.
I'm kind-of dreading what will happen to my bus when I try that run in
the middle of a 104 degree day...

In my old bus, which had no such things as gauges and new motors and so
forth, I would never have worried about any of this.  And heck, I look
at some of the hippybuses that make it all over the western hemisphere
on dumb luck wishfulthinking and ducktape, and I wonder why I'm all
uptight about it.  And I made it home just fine, (Trip report: Phoenix
to the campground, to Prescott to Cottonwood, to like 20 miles of fun
dirtroading, to Verde Valley to look at a 57 vw truck, back to Prescott
all the way to the campground, all over town, did the show on the lawn,
and back to Phoenix...)

So, questions that are answered 1000 times in the archive, but I'm
wondering still;

Is &quot;250&quot; by the VDO oil temp gauge &quot;overheated?&quot;  

What are the short- and long-term consequences of overheating?


Other than looking at the gauge and saying &quot;sh.. the gauge reads 250&quot;
what are the symptoms that would tell &quot;vw is overheating?&quot;  (My old 
bus had a certain smell to it, and when you stopped, a certain ticking
sound that was peculiar to being very hot and tired.)


Thanks for reading my silly trip report and specially to everybody I
pestered about squeaky wheels and so on!
