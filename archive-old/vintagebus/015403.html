&gt; 1.  Was this bumper painted in single or base/clear coat?  I said it
&gt; should of been single stage.  I was not sure about that.

Single stage.
 
&gt; 2.  Is this paint a metallic color?  I said that it is a very silverish
&gt; white-blue color but it did not have any metallic in it.  (please
&gt; correct me if I am wrong).

No, it's a solid color.
 
&gt; 3. How shinny is the final product?  I really could not answer this
&gt; question.  I did not think that it was a gloss finish nor a flat
&gt; finish.  He said that he would have to add a flattener if the final coat
&gt; was not shinny.

You add flattener to make it *less* shiny.  What's the other bumper look like?
How anal are you wanting to be?  I don't know the gloss factor, but I'm guess
~80% gloss.

&gt; 4. He stated that all they make now are eurothane paints and they used
&gt; acrylic paints originally on the VWs.  I stated that it was painted in
&gt; the &quot;21&quot; series of paint.  He then said that they make the &quot;22&quot; line to
&gt; match this.  (Ask you can tell it is the blind leading the blind).

Urethane.  Yes, you can't get the other stuff any more, but it's not big
deal.  I have no idea what &quot;21&quot; series paint is - anyone? anyone? Ferris?

&gt; Any suggestions for me?  I told him that I would need to talk to some
&gt; &quot;friends&quot; and then I would give him a call on Wednesday. TIA.

I rattle-canned mine with Rustoleum Gloss White and never looked back...
