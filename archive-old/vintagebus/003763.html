This is your last chance to request pre-printed color name tags to identify
yourself as a VintageBus listee for the OCTO/VW Classic weekend. As
described before, these are large name tags (4 in. diameter) printed on
CD-ROM labels with VintageBus_dot_com across the top, color logos of the OCTO
and VW Classic, and your name and whatever will fit across the bottom. These
tags will be easily recognizable, even from a distance. I will be leaving
for the show Friday morning, so if I haven't received your order by Thursday
night, you will have to settle for the black and white Xeroxed version which
I will bring to the show. Pre-show requests are also receiving a similarly
styled 8-1/2 x 11 placard printed on heavy card stock to put in their bus.
This will make identification of listees vehicles equally easy. Last call,
get 'em while you can.

Hope to see you all there.
