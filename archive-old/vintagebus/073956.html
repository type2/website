Subject: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

I had a pretty long list of stuff to order after deciding to get my 
Ebay camper on the road after letting it sit since I bought it two 
years ago.

I spent two days comparing prices, checking if the stuff was in stock, 
etc, and wound up ordering from the following four vendors: Go Westy, 
Bus Depot, Kustom 1, and Wolfburg West.  Following is my experience 
with these vendors so far, rated on a one to five star system:


Go Westy ****

The only thing I ordered from this vendor was a bottle of miracle stuff 
to rejuvinate my pop-up top.  Don't know if it will really work as 
claimed, but I thought it would be worth a try, considering the cost 
and effort of properly refinishing the top.  Anyway, I used their 
online ordering system, which charged $8.95 for shipping a 16 oz bottle 
of stuff which cost $12.95.  I thought this was overcharging on 
shipping, and I sent Go Westy an email telling them so.  They responded 
within an hour with a nice email, telling me they would just mail it 
Priority for $5.95.  Still more than actual postage, but I did 
appreciate their attitude.

By the close of business yesterday, Go Westy had already sent me an 
email to tell me that my order had been shipped!


Bus Depot: **

I had a long list of stuff to order from Bus Depot, after comparing 
their prices and availability of various parts, using their website.  
There is a note on their site which said that a telephoned order would 
be processed more quickly, so I phoned in my order.  I asked the man 
who took my order to tell me which items were actually in stock.  He 
told me that would not be possible while he was taking my order.  I 
told him that I needed to know, so that I could order the other items 
from another vendor, as I needed the stuff to ship ASAP.  He seemed to 
be annoyed by this request, but then said he could check to see what 
was in stock after taking my order.  After giving the man my order, he 
put me on hold for a couple of minutes, then told me that he had all 
but three or four items.  I told him to delete those items from the 
order, and I would order them elsewhere.  He then tried to convince me 
to keep them on the order, that he could probably get them in one to 
three days, and it would not be a problem.  I told him that I needed 
the order to ship right away, and not be held up while waiting for 
parts to come in.  He told me it would not be a problem, and I would 
still get my order in &quot;seven to ten business days&quot;.  I asked when my 
order would actually ship, and he answered &quot;in time for you to get it 
in seven to ten business days&quot;.  I was getting frustrated, as ten 
business days means two weeks - longer with the holiday coming up, and 
he was not answering my question.  I again asked when the order would 
actually ship.  Answer: when we finish the 100 orders ahead of you.  I 
told him that that didn't answer my question, as I had no idea how many 
orders they could process in one day.  He asked if I wanted expedited 
shipping.  I said, not if it means paying extra for air shipping.  He 
again told me that he would guarantee that I would get my order in 
seven to ten business days, which he said was &quot;normal for ground 
shipping&quot;.  Well, no it isn't (3 days from the east coast to the 
midwest is normal), but I didn't want to argue with him.  I gave him my 
cc info and got off the phone, irritated with the whole experience, and 
wondering why this place gets such good reviews.  Maybe the parts will 
arrive quickly and I'll be happier then.


Kustom 1 Warehouse: ***

This is one of the big advertisers in the mags, selling volume stuff a 
rock bottom prices, with a lot of really inferior stuff thrown in with 
some regular name-brand stuff.  I ordered some KYB GR2s, some fuel line 
($1/ft), fresh air hoses, front wheel grease seals, and push rod tubes. 
  The guy took my order quickly and told me that everything &quot;should be 
in stock&quot;, as it was all common stuff.  True enough, so I let it pass 
without pressing.  I asked if I could call back in a day or two to get 
a tracking number (and then I could also see if everything actually was 
in stock), and he told me no problem.

I give Kustom 1 a qualified three star rating, because past orders have 
arrived with parts missing, poor quality stuff, wrong parts, etc.  The 
three stars is for this ordering experience ONLY.


Wolfsburg West *****

I used their website to place my order.  The site is very good, with 
clear diagrams and fairly good part descriptions.  They site tells you 
which items are in stock and which are not.  This was the only vendor I 
tried which had my front seat upholstery in stock.  All I would change 
would be to list the brand name and country of origin in every part 
description.  I quickly got an order confirmation by email, and it said 
that my order would ship within 24 hours.  Based upon past experience 
with WW, I believe this.


I will post a followup when all of the parts actually arrive, and let 
you know if the orders were filled properly, well packed, how long it 
actually took each firm to process each order, and if they marked up 
the shipping charges above published rates.
