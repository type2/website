Subject: [VB] Re: Castrol and BP

At the moment Mobil1 15-50, but no real advantage except emptying my wallet. 
  Next up is the HD30 Wal-Mart el cheapo brand to try it out.  If that is 
junk back to HD30 Pennzoil or Castrol.  No bat guano in my oil for additives 
either ;)

In my next motor (the T5 oxy-boxer) I will try out the diesel blends.  
Rotella from Shell 15-40 and/or the Mobil synthetic diesel blend which brand 
is escaping me at the moment...

As for tires.  The Kumho KH11s 205/65/R15 seem to be doing well on the 15x7 
Phones.

Beer.  That Michelob Ultra is pretty nice.  (since Miller is now owned by a 
South African company I have slowed my Miller Lite consumption drastically, 
which has helped out Johnny Walker and Anhieser-Busch a lot)

Ahhh that was fun,
Adrian Pillow

Disclaimer: I run Castrol GTX straight 30 weight in my Bus, along with
a semi-sekrit additive blend (cockatoo poop, among other things).  And
like the High Performance chapter in later editions of the Idiot manual
says, &quot;Asking people what kind of oil they use is like asking what beer
they drink.&quot;

If anyone has anything to add, please speak up quick.  The &quot;what tires
should I use&quot; thread is scheduled next.  :)
