I haven't driven my 58 SC much lately because the generator needs replacing
and I haven't gotten to it yet.  But I decided to drive it to work this
morning.  I hopped in and the first thought in my head was, &quot;do I have
enough gas?&quot;.  I looked at the mileage and compared it to my &quot;fill-up log&quot;
and saw I had only gone about 75 miles since the last fill up.  No problem.


So there I was, driving along at about 55 and enjoying the feeling of a
splitty when the 'ol beast hiccuped a few times.  It came to me in a flash
of brilliance that my speedo cable broke about 2 months ago and that &quot;DUH!!&quot;
the odometer hadn't moved since then.  About then the motor died.  But I was
within coasting distance of a gas station (where I pumped over 15 gallons
into my retro-fit loaf tank).

Just thought I'd share this little anecdote with ya'll.  Since it's Friday
and all.
