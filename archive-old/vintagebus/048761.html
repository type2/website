Subject: '59 Kombi...clutch fixed!!!

As you may remember, after overhauling the engine in my '59 Kombi and 
installing it, I realized the clutch needed to be replaced. So I 
pulled the engine and ordered the parts from Ronnie at 
http://www.oldvolks_dot_com .

Got the clutch parts in real quick. I ordered them Tuesday and 
recieved them Friday. Pretty cool considering it was so closed to 
X-Mas and all. I installed them on the motor this week and did a few 
other things before eventually installing the engine. I just got done 
connecting all my new wires and fuel lines (had to move the fuel pump 
to make room for my heating system). Fired up the engine. As usual it 
fired up fine without even having to touch the gas pedal. But then it 
stopped. I tried to start it again. It would fire, but wouldn't stay 
going.

Learning from mistakes of the past, I started simple first and put 
some gas in the tank. Fired it up and it kept running. OUT OF GAS. 
Easy fix.

So I let it warm a bit and then headed out for a 1 mile test drive. 
First thing I noticed was I could no longer put the bus in first the 
way I did before. Before I could almost let the clutch out without 
any gas and it would start moving. That killed the engine this time 
with the new parts. So I tried it the more normal way and then took 
off.

New clutch parts seemed to be working great. That was definatly the 
problem No more slipping at all. I got up into 4th and cruised just 
fine. Speedo said 45mph, but I don't know how accurate it actually 
is. I'm gonna get my wife to follow me in the Ch*vy to compare.

Gotta bleed the brakes. I'm gonna get registration tommarrow or early 
next week. Then it'll be time for the good 'ol inspection. Hopefully 
one of the small time local gas garages will have mercy on me and my 
old bus.

When I got the bus, it had one of those green outlined type of 
stickers on the rear window. This one is of &quot;STIMPY&quot; from The Ren &amp; 
Stimpy show. When I put the window back in, I left it on. The colors 
of my bus is kind of a red/orange and white. Close enough I think. So 
the name of the bus is &quot;Stimpy&quot;. Fits for sure.
