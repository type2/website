Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] VDO Oil Pressure sender

Hi Volks,
We prefer the one terminal type pressure sender and we use a T-fitting to 
pipe it and the idiot light sender to the engine.  If the pressure sender for 
the gauge goes bad we have a seperate idiot light sender.  If both gauge and 
idiot light use the same sender there is a good chance if the single sender 
goes bad, both the pressure guage and idiot light will not work properly.  At 
least that is the way we figured it!
