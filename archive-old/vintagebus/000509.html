&lt;&lt; I'm too tired to look in the archives tonight.  I will tomorrow.  But in
 the short term, can anyone give me the hot tip to getting a rear drum
 unstuck from the stub axle??  I've tried liquid wrench type stuff,
 heat/water/heat cycles, tapping &amp; pounding, and using a mondo US made
 two arm puller my old mechanic neighbor has.
 
 Not even a budge!   Yes I backed the adjusters off all the way.  The
 drum spins freely.  Is there anything I'm missing???

rust on the splines it seems like, gluing drum to stub axle, so be sure to 
grease it when you put it together.  Get liquid wrench and spray at the end 
of the stub axle.  Get sturdy screwdriver suitable for pounding on, and the 
BFH, and hit the side of the brake shoe through the hole in the drum, 
alternate sides to hit it evenly.  do make sure the screwdriver end is 
resting on the shoe.  I have an all metal BFSD for this and similar purposes. 
  This is a socially acceptable way to vent your aggressions, yelling and 
cussing helps.  Be creative.  Include the person who put it together without 
grease.
