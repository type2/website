Was written...................
&quot;&quot;When I realized that ALL my local flaps now carried
nothing but GL5 tranny oil, I went on a panicky search
at the local wholesalers... almost bought a 120lb KEG
of GL4!&quot;&quot;   ......................................

Just a note
I was at my local Raleys Supermarket today and I was
walking down the auto section looking for a can of
Carb cleaner when I noticed that they actually carry
pint containers of Sta-Lube 90wt GL4 Tranny fluid.
And this is market isn't even in town.
 Man-o-man, who would have figured that.....
