Subject: more brake light problems

D*mn

First I want to thank all of those helpful list members who got me this far
..... this wiring stuff is a confusing for a poor simple minded guy like me.

So now I have both brake lights working and the lil' bulbs in the headlight
buckets and both head lights high and low - and a new problem has developed.
Now the rear tail-lights don't work.  The rear signal lights and brake
lights both work fine but the tail lights don't come on when the headlight
switch is pulled out.  It's dark now so I can't fiddle with it but I've
checked the fuses and they appear to be fine though I don't recall them
being that thin - I think I'll change em ... but that can't be the problem -
I wouldn't think.

And a stereo - how should I wire that.  I currently have it just plugged
into a fuse but what is the right way.  And a cigarette lighter.  I
currently have that just plugged into a fuse but what is the right way for
that.  The cigarette lighter is just this cheapo thing I picked up to plug
my cooler into, I only rarely use it but does keep the drinks cold

TIA
