Speaking of said latches... anybody need some?

I have a whole pile of them... at least 1 set that is primo and no pits,
another that is so-so, and some that have the little latch part broke off.
Maybe a few others as well.

I started collecting them when I thought my 59 should have them but decided
the through hole types were the correct ones.

BTW, I have no rails... just the latches.

Let me know.

David
