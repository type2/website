Scott,
      You are one busy guy!!  That's a good idea on the sock screen in the
tank, my local parts lady, well okay she's a goddess sells the sock screen and
a new washer for a buck.   And I imagine that any VW parts place should have
these or be able to get them.  So if anyone decides to do their tank it's
sorta nice to have the parts on hand, before hand.
   Peace, Love, and Happiness is a smooth sliding door,
       Mr. Bubble Head
