I recently received a vehicle tax notice from the county that I live
in.  I new it was for  my recently purhcased bus so I knew that it would
not be expensive.  I looked at the cost of the tax and I was amazed. It
said that it was $105.94 for the 1998-99 fiscal year.  I thought that it
was a little step since my girlfriends new toyota was 80 bucks but so
what.  I then looked at the estimated &quot;vehicle value&quot; and it said
$8,200.  I was very impressed, I guess.  I mean my bus is special to me
and we are becoming better friends everyday but that is a lot of bread
for my splitty.  Well, just curious if any one has had a similar
experience.  For those wondering, I live in Cary, NC.

* one quick question, is 90 weight hypoid gear oil used in the
transmission? thanks.

1966 Deluxe  (soon to be named)
