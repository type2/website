&lt;&lt; Apparently cylinders 1 and 2 aren't functioning properly.  Hmm... guess =

Hi Diana,
If the lobes of the cam wear down too much either due to a bad cam or all too 
often due to too high of engine temps which thin out the oil too much and 
this robs it of it's lubrication properties which in turn allows the cam 
lobes to be ground down.  When this happens the valves are not opened enough 
to allow the piston/s to suck in air fuel mixture or push out the exhaust 
gases properly.   

  FWIW, I put on new pistons and cylinders and new heads in the spring, but I 
didn't do anything to the bottom end at all, mostly due to fear of the 
unknown.  I figured that was as far as I wanted to go for the time being, but 
I knew it would come back to haunt me and it has. &gt;&gt;
BTDT!  If it is worth doing, it worth doing the right way the first time.  ;-)

&lt;&lt;The linkage appears fine, nothing amiss in the front shifter area or the 
rear coupling.  Is this a sign of a dying tranny?&gt;&gt;
Are you sure all three or four of the coupler bolts are tight.  Had simular 
loose play and even a rattle which turned out to be one of these bolts which 
had been safety wired in such a way that it allowed the bolt to loosen

&lt;&lt;Can anyone tell me what the symptoms of a worn throw-out bearing are?  A 
friend suggested that might be why my engine seems to emit a loud(er) 
thudding sound when the clutch pedal is depressed.&gt;&gt;
Might be that the throw out bearing is not aligned equally side to side in 
relation to the tranny input shaft.  This results in the bearing being shoved 
to one side and drawn back toward center buy the clutch pressure plate.  This 
in turn wears out the throw out arms with the shuffling side to side of the 
TO bearing.

&lt;&lt;Any advice on what to do with the tranny?  rebuild?  try to buy a used 
one?&gt;&gt;
If your linkage is ship shape then tach your present tranny and start 
thinking about a rebuilt tranny and your choices of gearing and R&amp;P.
