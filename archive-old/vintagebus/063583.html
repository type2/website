Subject: Re: [VB] Front Beam Identification

gerneral rule is that if the can pry the axle nut covers off easily because 
they have a handy lip, it's a later beam.  the 63 and earliers dont have 
lips.  For the earliers the steering damper is attached one end to the frame, 
the laters both ends are on the beam assembly

&lt;&lt; Just picked up a '60 Single Cab.  My first Splitty!  I'm trying to figure 
this thing out.  It's a bit of a hodge podge of different years.  I was told 
the front beam was from a '67?  From checking various parts vendors lists I 
can see there is a difference in beams from '64 and up?  I need to order a 
few things and wanted to verify that I have a '67 beam.  Here's a pic from 
the torsion arm/drum area (you may have to cut&amp;paste)...
