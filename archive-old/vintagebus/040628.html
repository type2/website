Subject: Deal on Boge shocks!

I just got a closeout deal on Boge shocks that might interest some list
members.

These are genuine Boge original-equipment shocks, made by Boge/Mexico to
Boge/Germany specs.  (Sachs/Boge has had an affiliate factory in Mexico for
some time, which builds much of their Sachs and Boge branded product.)
Supposedly they're as good as the German ones and have to meet the German
Boge specs according to the terms of their contract with Germany. But even
if they just come close, the're a heck of a lot of shock for the money,
since they're now priced at what you'd normally pay for an &quot;off brand&quot;
shock.

Price is $16.95 each (plus shipping).  Applications are:

Rear,  '65-67 bus    211 513 031H  (Boge claims this shock is also for front
of '66-67??)
Front, '68-79 bus    211 413 031P  (Boge lists it as '70-79, but others list
same part # as '68-79.)
Rear,  '68-79 bus    211 513 031R


The reason for the bargain price is that they are boxed under the a brand
name that Boge is no longer going to use, which is Technum.  They had been
using this name in certain international markets, and apparantly their
marketing arm has now decided to use the Boge name in those markets as well.
So I bought out the Technum branded ones at a closeout price. These are the
same shocks that are being shipped under the Boge name. I got them directly
from Sachs/Boge themselves, along with a memo confirming their pedigree.

These are an oil filled, not a gas-charged shock, just like the stock ones
that Boge made for VW.  They would be just the ticket for someone who wants
to maintain his bus's stock ride, rather than opting for the somewhat
stiffer ride (and higher price) of a performance gas shock like the KYB
Gas-Adjust.

They will hopefully be on the website Saturday morning.  In the meantime,
you can always e-mail me to order, or give us a call at the shop on Monday
(by which time they will definately be on the website anyway).

This was a limited-quantity buy, so it will be first-come first-served.
(Splitty shocks particularly are in short supply.)
