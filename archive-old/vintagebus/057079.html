Subject: Re: [VB] My new 62 15 window deluxe

If red and white, the colors would be Sealing Wax Red and Beige Grey.  I
think the colors are L53 and L472.  I have a 1961 SWR and BG 15-window
walk-through.  I also have an old VW advertisement from a Life magazine
from 1962 showing both the SWR and BG Deluxe, and a Mouse Gray standard,
those being the same colors of my 62 Standard.  Hey, those are my busses
in the ad!  Too bad mine don't look that good!

1962 Standard Micro - Gretchen
1961 Deluxe Micro - Jessel
1959 Deluxe Beetle - Uncle Horst

There may be 3 of us, but the VW's are all mine.  Mine!  MINE I tell you!
