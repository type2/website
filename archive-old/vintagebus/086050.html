Subject: Short Block Cleaning

I've got my engine down to almost a short block (P&amp;Cs still on) and want to know from the list what is the general consensus on cleaning the old dirt, oil and grime from the engine? Also what would everyone recommend to clean the carbon off of the piston tops?

Lastly I have a case stud (two above oil pump right next to big funky plug) that has stripped and the PO had put in a helicoil and now the helicoild has failed and the stud no longer tightens down. Found that out in and attempt to re-torque the case. What does the collective mind of Vee Dub land think about that one?

I'm trying to get this old 67 H case ready for a cross country trip (NC to San Dog) and want it as good as it gets.
