&gt; Interesting.  I've never had much problem on either side, with the

&gt; Well, I did have problems on the left when I had a gas heater, but
&gt; that was slightly-incorrect installation of the heater's fault.

On an early bus with teh bent arm that is on the throwout shaft, they bent
it so it puts the clutch cable right into that bolt, makes it dang hard to
get a wrench on it, at least it was for me.

take care,

Steve
