The search for a split screen bus officially ended this morning in Chapel
Hill, NC. During the last few weeks I have been on the &quot;looking for a bus
roller coaster.&quot; The ride came to an end when a bus found me! 

I had looked into several local buses for sale the were in need of the kind
of love that we just could not afoard to give. Others slipped between my
fingers of were just not realistically priced. There was a very interesting
'65 EZ in Tenn. that I was gathering info on via a local listmember. I was
also seriously considering a bus in the PNW: a 1965 sunroof standard. Local
listmember Craig Spaeth checked the bus out for me and even scanned some
pics. I really liked the bus and was looking into transportation options
back to the rusty east when it happened. I received an email from longtime
local busfreak, NEATO member and all around great person, Judy Neville. 

Judy was well aware of the situation with our wrecked '69 and knew we were
looking for a split screen bus to use as a daily driver and family transport
vehilce. She was also considering thinning her heard and wanted her dearly
loved first ever bus to go to a good home. Judy got the '67 twenty years ago
and has loved and enjoyed it since the day she bought it. I know it was hard
for her to sell and I can assure her that the bus will be well loved by us
and taken good care of!!!!!!!

The bus is resting peacefully in the yard now. It has been quite a day for
the two of us. My search for a bus to replace the smashed up '69 is over and
the '67 will be prepped during the next few weeks to daily driver status. 

The NC state inspection lasped several months ago due to some minor problems
with windsheild wipers and I have discovered a few electrical bugs that
should be easy to straighten out. The only major problem with the bus is a
the drivers side rocker and the 4&quot; of metal above it. This will have to be
replaced in the very near future. I keep thinking how lucky I am to live
within 20 miles of Kelly Brown(a.k.a MetWiz :)&gt;

I am going to order an Bentley tonite and get that NEATO membership check in
the mail too! And of course I will be posting lotsa questions( after
thouroughly checking the archives of course:)&gt;

Along with the bus I also was gifted a complete set of six popouts from a
1958 bus. Judy had stashed these for eventual replcement of the rusty ones
on the '67. They are in good shape. Will these fit without mods ot the later
'67 bus?
