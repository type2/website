&lt;&lt; Alright, i did it. I think i found TDC, it was about an inch of space where
 it was at its highest point. In between is TDC? ok. It was a little ways
 away from the notches, but i was told to ignore those by several.&gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
Great!  It should be to the left of those marks most likely.

&lt;&lt;If the fuel pump is working, should there be gas inside of it, when i take
the top off?&gt;&gt;
Yes, most definitely!

&lt;&lt; I am getting gas to the fuel pump, as i took the line off, and it filled
up a coffee can while i wasnt looking :)&gt;&gt;
Good that at the least means that your fuel line is hopefully clear.  Did the
fuel come out at a good rate?  If not there might be some clog partly closing
off the flow and starving the engine.

&lt;&lt; oops. Anyhow, i dont think its getting from the pump to the carb. The line
on the carb WILL NOT come off. Is there a trick, or a special tool i can
design or buy?&gt;&gt;
    Okay, hopefully you have good German fuel line.  To get it moving instead
of just pulling try pulling and at the same time give it a twist.  The German
cloth covered fuel line has a tendancy to act like those Chinese finger cuffs
and just pulling tightens them on tighter!

&lt;&lt; (tricks first, tools second, know what i mean? ) Anything to
 stop driving this godforsaken toyota.&gt;&gt;
Here is a good trick you might want to try.  Except for the single cab truck
the rest of the buses have thier fuel tank just forward and higher than the
engine case.  If you have a bad fuel pump and a fuel tank fuller than half
full you can do this trick just to get back on the road.  Remove the fuel
line from the carburator.  Then with some of your spare fuel line run it from
the metal fuel line that is comming from the tank to the fuel pump to the
carburator directly bypassing the fuel pump completely.  This will supply
fuel by gravity feed as long as you keep the tank fuller than half!  Then to
prevent fire possibily run a short section of fuel line from the inlet of the
fuel pump to it's outlet to prevent any fuel in it from being sprayed out
while the engine is running.  If the engine now runs fine then you need to
replace the fuel pump and/or the fuel pump push rod is not tall enough and it
needs replacement, and/or the drive geart below might be bad.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Thanks again for all the help, and being tolerant of newbies :). &gt;&gt;
You are welcome, hope you are on the road soon.  Eric&amp;Barb
