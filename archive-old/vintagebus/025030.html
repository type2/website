Joe,
      I was thinking like the drive away tents but made for a Single Cab, I
guess the Bed could also be used as part of the setup if it was covered or
attached to the tent securely somehow.

Thanks,
Nathan

&gt; &gt;a tilt would work but access climbing in and out would be a pain.  Ideas

&gt;
&gt; Neat idea.  Do you mean a tent for the bed (like those canvas covers) or
&gt; a side/rear tent?
&gt;
&gt; What's a tilt?
&gt;
&gt; You might could hang an awning-type tent or screen-room off the side
&gt; from the *frame* of one of those canvas cover things, or something like
&gt; that.  Hmmm.... Or you could adapt a &quot;foyer&quot; tent to the pasenger side
&gt; door. :-)
