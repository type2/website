&lt;&lt;  Is it a bad thing to just dump 80-90 wt gear oil (like the wal-mart 
brand) into the tranny &amp; rgb's??  Someone on the list said that gl-5 is bad, 
well what is gl 4, 5, 6, really mean? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve &amp; Rachelle,
Yes, it is bad if you just dump anytype of GL trans oil in there, and it 
turns out later that you ruined your syncros.  The GLs mean differant 
formulations, so unless you are a chemist it is best to just remember to use 
only GL-4!
