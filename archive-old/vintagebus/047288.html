Well, my third BBB show is under my belt.
728 miles worth of driving.
All this for a three hour stay in lake havasu, AZ.
I was gone a total of 13 hours which included two one hour naps on the side 
of the road.
Thanks to ronnie, john, terry, and all of LBB for a great show.
Cant wait to do it again next year.
Regards, Greg Noble

&lt;&lt; holly moly what a turn out, over 150 registered buses and at least another

50 that didn't.

chili cook off was great and you could smell that around the campsites

later.

first and second raffle also went well with some great stuff.

the 66 westy walkthrough camper is up to 975.00 in the auction, it's the

zebra striped one in some of the pictures.

the redhead lady in some of the pictures is my wife, how could someone like

me have someone like that? I'm the one on the stage with the balding head

and the goatee.

found a great little accessory there, an original VDO foot operated

windshield washer foot pump with a switch that turns on

the wiper when you pump it!

the BBQ dinner went great with over 150 people eating, not bad for for first

attempt at this, not as many as our FREE taco's Friday, at least 300 people

for that event.

the kids had a great time with the piñata and they got to play with

play-dough and painted a square back (couldn't find a bus for it this year)

so Sunday we'll wind down and everyone will head home, with nothing but a

good memory of a very good time,  A lot of listys here so there should be

some interesting stories in a few days.


I'm tired so good night
