Well gang i bught this here bus on a whim, You just dont see splits
running around the northeast. I saw the ad at 9 am bought at 12pm.
The truck came up from fl. Fairly decent, the rust worm has reared
its ugly head, however, the frame rails and body supports are 100%.
The side windows are shot , but fortune has it that it came with 2 
front doors and complete set of side windows, just sand and paint
and dump the rusty frames. Did a tune up WOW the mech advance
 was stuck. Replaced the master, no more add the fluid and dbl pump 
to stop. Fixed the clock, lubed the front end, changed the rear fluids.
  The funny thing about all this, i own a body resto shop up here in 
New Hampshire and play with all sorts of oddities, love 911's, worked
worked on REO's to Geo's, Deux Cheveux's to .......whatever drives in!
Any way bought myself a nice Saab Conv. for the summer to replace my 
4 door ski saab, and start pluggin away at a 69 911E, welding here and 
there. Buy the bus, work on the 911 has literally ground to a halt! I parked
the Saab in the garage w/ the top down no less, And drive this bus now.
Is this a real sickness or what? Ibrought my daughter home last weekend,
shes 10 loves it, supposed to be 2.25 hrs highway, took longer. Drove
back from the top of Vermont down to the mid of NH all back roads,
what a blast, took 4.5 hrs with stoppin and lookin at the scenery. But 
anyways what a blast. 

  SO ANYWAY PARTS WISH
rt side rear window jailbars
top bows for headliner?
mid seat
rear seat
front and rear bumpers and bkts
splash panel for front pedal area (under neath)
cargo door latch assm. (handle on ouside busted off)
freakin vw emblem on nose (i used striping tape! to rename her)
 a new 09 distrib ( Wobbles)

 so what is this stuff worth, do i wait for swaps(missed one locally)
i trust from what i have seen  so far on the list the answers lie within...

HEY THOM The girlfriends surfboard is just as sexy a tail on the bus
as a whaletail on a &quot;flared&quot; 911 !!! *LOL*
