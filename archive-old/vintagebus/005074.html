Subject: seat belt for 1967

My 1967 Deluxe is being restored at the moment.  One dilemma I have is
whether to use the standard lap belt or a 3-point harness.  I have read
messages in the achieve discussing the pros &amp; cons.  My local VW shop here
sells EMPI 3-point retractable harness.  They claim that it is long enough
for putting into a bus, but are not 100% sure.

Just curious if anyone has had any success with these?

Thank You,
HK
