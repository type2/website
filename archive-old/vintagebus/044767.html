&lt;&lt; I think I understand what they're talking about for a spacer to make the 
pushrod easier to adjust.  Does anyone sell this piece as a ready-made part?  
How about just cutting the mounting flange off a junk (or cheap non-original 
repop) master cylinder
 and using that as a spacer...?&gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Last time we checked you could get an aluminum one with the rubber boot for 
$50.00 from Wolfgang Int. in Redding CA..  As for cutting off the forward 
piece of stock pre-1968 MC you would need a lathe to do it properly or take 
all day to use a hand file and calipers to hand machine it evenly.
 
&lt;&lt;Some of the original brake line is kinda rusty on the outside, so who knows 
what it looks like on the inside.  WW and probably other vendors sell a 
&quot;brake line kit&quot; of all the steel lines on the car.  I think I'll use almost 
all of the lines in the kit, even after the conversion - is this true?  Or 
would I be better off buying individual steel lines?  (I already plan to 
replace all the flex lines.)&gt;&gt;
Good idea!  We have talked to a fellow who had his all rebuilt brake single 
circuit MC system fail due to the metal line running to the rear having blown 
out due to interior corrosion.  For this reason he was converting over to 
dual circuit MC even though he had since then replaced all of his metal brake 
lines.
 
&lt;&lt;Finally, will the dual-circuit MC still be appropriate if I swap to disks 
later?  I know this is a lot more work and involves more parts changes, but 
if I can upgrade to dual-circuit now and leave an easy upgrade path to discs 
later I want to do that. &gt;&gt;
The conversion we wrote up and is now in the library uses a bus 1972 and 
later MC.  Guess what was stock for front brakes during that time.  You will 
only need to install a proportion valve when you do the disc conversion.
