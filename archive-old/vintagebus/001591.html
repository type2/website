Not that I'm not talking about heat in a bus (I WILL figure out how to
efficiently heat a bus when stationary...someday), but I am now referring to
keeping heat (once established) in a bus....that is:  insulation.

Specifically:  The panels that curve around the upper back ....have cavities
that you could reach into if you had really long arms.  Is there an
agreed-upon method of insulating these?  Foam (the squirty kind) insulation
seems a bit risky, if not downright bad news, and although I'll be
insulating the spaces directly behind the curved wood Westie panels, I want
to make sure that all space not being used for storage, etc. is filled with
some kind of noise- and heat loss reducing substance
