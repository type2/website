Subject: Re: [VB] Thanks from Wink, 1600 overheating problem
References: &lt;98.7e04657.26ab19b2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

We have a 59 panel with a ???65 1600 ??   F1998808  block  with fresh air heater
How do we check if the valves for the heater are opening up to release the air
over the
heat exchangers Our heat to the interior works good when the valves are turned on
and is off when off.
We still have a temp of 225 to 235 degs at 45 to 50 mph at 2800 to 3000 rpms at
85 degs day
As noted before all tin is in place and holes plugged with doghouse with type 4
cooler.

thanks

&gt; &lt;&lt; The fan housing tubes are/were closed off. We have taped the holes from
&gt; the heat risers with alum. tape. The guy at Oval's said the heat would not go
&gt; into the engine compartment and get pushed away from the van, but I wondered.
&gt; Anyway the temp seems to be unaffected after putting the heater boxes on,
&gt; either hotter or cooler. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Wink,
&gt; Right!  With the tubes sealed off to the heaters the pre-1972 bus heat
&gt; exchangers just heat up and up.  They are designed so that cooling air goes
&gt; through them not only when you have the interior heat on, but even when the
&gt; interior heat is off.  The valve that turns on/off the heat to the interior
&gt; of your VW is a double flapper valve that also opens (When closing off the
&gt; heat to the interior.) a cooling opening in the back of the head that is
&gt; shaped kind of like a shell of each heater cooling the exhaust.  Without this
&gt; cooling of the heater tubes the exhaust gases are not cooled and condensed.
&gt; Instead the gasses stay hot and continue to expand causing extreme back
&gt; pressure against #1 &amp; #3 cylinders which in turn causes more heat to be
&gt; transfered to the heads and into the engine.
