Hi Brian,  you wrote:




I've owned 2 '64's, both &quot;late&quot; 64's.. one of them a 21 window, the other a

Westy, and neither one of these had windshield squiters...



A friend of mine had an early '64 21 window, and his didn't have the things

either..



guess the &quot;standard in 64&quot; rule doesn't quite apply...  I didn't think they

were ever standard equipment..

okay- well the impression I had that is they were standard from 64.    Most
times the bottle is missing and/or the cap is cracked and unusuable.   My
early 65 camper has the squirter bits unde rhe wipers and the tubes running to
where h bottle mounts (botle gone)    There is a differnt kind of squirter bit
for 66-67, I believe.   Now I look in the book.    Where is it ? - looking and
looking through section 8 (body).  Aha - It is listed with the wiper motors in
section 9- electrical.  there is a listing for the squirter bottle, and a the
squirter jets (aka nozzles on nose) are changed for 66/67 models (as of 216
000 001).  But no listing of from chassis no, and not listed as a M code or
specific body style, which means at the time this was published (early 67)
they were standard.

Another book- the progressive changes lists a windsheild washer as of ch #215
000 001.  So oops, it is standard as of the *65* model year.  You're right-
they weren't standard on 64s.   There is also  a differnet style that I have
seen (two of) that I believe is optional on earlier buses.
