Both the shuttle, and the apollo capsules were/are rotated &quot;rotisserie&quot; 
style to keep the heat even all over, since one side faces the sun and the 
other faces, well, away from the sun.  When they were testing the apollo 
capsules back in the early sixties, they built a huge vacuum chamber at JSC 
that could accomodate a full size apollo CM and SM, and baked one side of it 
with heat lamps, and poured liquid nitrogen down the other side to make sure 
that the structure could handle the thermal stresses.  Sorry, no numbers, 
just worthless anecdotes you could share around the water cooler.

The shuttle also has panels on the inside of its cargo doors that are used 
for heat exchange to vent heat.  I don't know the exact mechanism used.  
There have been a couple of shuttle missions that almost had to return to 
earth just after reaching orbit because of difficulty getting the cargo bay 
doors open, and hence difficulty dissipating heat.  On the 4th shuttle 
mission, as nasa was still playing around with the rotisserie turning (on 
which axis?  how fast?, etc.) at the conclusion of the mission the cargo bay 
doors would not close because they had expanded by a couple of inches.  They 
had to slow down the rotation, and rotate on a different axis to cool them 
down enough to close them

I guess this probably should have waited for friday.

&gt; &gt;It had to be really efficient, right?  And its COLD out there!!
&gt;
&gt;In space you have extreme heat on one side of the ship and extreme cold
&gt;on the other. I believe they had a system to transfer the thermal energy
&gt;to even it out. I know that the Space Shuttle has a system for expelling
&gt;exessive heat out through the open cargo bay.
