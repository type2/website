&gt;Ok listees,
&gt;
&gt;How do we identify each other at OCTO? or do we just remain a bunch of
&gt;faceless computer nerds showing off/looking at the busses?
&gt;


I'll be dragging the 1999 Arizona Bus club raffle bus (1965 doublecab)
behind the Westfailure. It should stand out like a turd in a punch bowl, so
if any of you all get lost and need help finding your mommies, or wanna hang
out and see who shows up, you are more than welcome. We will probably be
setting up a club booth there so it should be manned or womanned pretty much
continuously. I'll hang a vintagebus sign in the windshield just in case any
other stretched V8 Westies show up pulling doublecabs so there won't be any
confusion. We'll have shade and chairs, so if you all want to meet there
you're more than welcome. See you there!
