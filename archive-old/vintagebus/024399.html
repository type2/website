Subject: More Mexican engine update

I drove it for about 50 miles last night.  It is pretty cold here, about
40oF.

I didn't take the bus over 50mph, or about 3000RPM.  I just put heavy
duty 205/75R14s on her
and that lowered RPMs considerably (ok, about 100rpm at 50) over
185/75R14.

At the beginning of the drive, she didn't run so good.  Had to get rpms
up before moving, and died
when I took foot off gas suddenly.  My guess is that this was a
combination of my carb adjust and
maybe things not sitting 100%.

By the end of the hour long drive she had plenty of power, and no
trouble idling (idle was very slow
at about 700rpm, more evidence that I adjusted the carb wrong, plus the
choke isn't right for this
temperature).  I've got a feeling this carb is running lean.

I saw oil temps up to 190oF (usually after hitting a stop light) but the
temp would plunge the
minute I started driving again which must be an artifact of having a
completely stock engine
(no sump yet, no filter yet).  It seemed to settle at about 180oF which
still seems high
given the outside temp and the fact that I'm driving slow.

Tonight I will:
adjust valves (1st time since engine installation)
change oil (2nd time since engine installation)
hook up heat (brrrr)
drive some more!
