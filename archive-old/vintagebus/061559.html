Subject: Re: [VB] engine bolts

The threaded bit is an insert.    You can tap it out of the case.
I have heard that some folks want the inserts.

I have this great tool that has a magnetic 17mm socket bit, and two ears.  
you set it on the end of the bolt at the tranny end, then can put the nut on 
the engine side esily.  Before that I did the vise grip thing.  For the 
starter side I'd get the bolt through, then start the nut on the bolt.  put 
vise grips on the nut, and then use a couple extensions to reachy past the 
starter and tighten it down with a ratchet from under neath.

 i was thinking of drilling out the hole-so it is not threaded, then just
 having a nut inside the engine compartment. that way i could just slip the
 bolt in, try to clamp a vise grip on it, then put the nut in from the engine
 compartment side. this is what i need to do for the passenger side top. the
 half moon bolt does not work with my starter/solenoid. i guess the 6volt
 starter has a different shape.
