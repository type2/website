We are currently using Netscape 4.75 mail program.  Our vintage bus sub
folder currently contains over 3500 messages.  We do selective deletes
on emails (not many).  There are also many other folders with large
numbers of email close to 8000 messages total.  Close to 100 MB of mail
storage.  The folders need to be compacted occasionally.  This is
usually done automatically when you empty the trash.  Also easy to back
up.  We have never lost any email with netscape.  We have not used
version 6 as AOL seems to have created problems when they took over
netscape.  We would suggest staying with the more stable 4.75 until they
come up with at least version 6.2.  

You can import your outlook express mail to netscape.
