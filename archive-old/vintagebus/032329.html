&lt;&lt;  I just remembered that I bought a new, bigger oil pump and went to
 put it on.  Trying to get the old one off, I pried on it with the big 
screwdriver
 and the edge of it broke off. &gt;&gt;
Hi Diana,
Naughty, naughty!  You definitely need to buy an oil pump puller, and loosen 
the case nuts bolts around that area.  Once you have the old pump off make 
sure you did not cut a nice groove in the case all the way across the paper 
gasket area to allow a nice oil leak there.   Eric&amp;Barb
