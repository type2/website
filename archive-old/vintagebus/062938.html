Anyone have a new., or used in good condition, accelerator pump diaphragm
they'd part with for a price.  My Dells were rebuilt about a year ago.  Was
putting them on the Motor a couple of nights ago.  When I installed the
Linkage I noticed that one of the  accelerator pumps wasn't working.  I took
off the cover and noticed it was just stuck and that the diaphragm had a
tear.  Hate to have to buy a whole rebuilt kit.
