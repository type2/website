&gt; I have a space reserved for swapping parts and will have the '66 Bug up
&gt; for sale there.  Looking forward to it!

I will have a very nice deluxe middle seat for a 65-67 bus, with
original salt and peppah. $350 takes it away. Anyone want to make a deal
before the swap and save me the $15 for the swap spot?
