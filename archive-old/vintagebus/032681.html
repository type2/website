i apparently sold it to a middle man.  the lhd, left cargo door bus, model
233.  i was lied to by him about his intentions for the bus, plain and
simple. it was on the japanese site before he even had the bus. i was
pissed about this, but nothing i could do, a deal is a deal. 
by selling it though, i was able to purchase my current bus, a 61 westy,
and have some change.  i don't like to see things go to japan. from what i
understand, they cannot be re-imported here if they go there.  am i wrong?
anyway, i did hear of a fleet of model 233's in chicago, back in the 60's. 
supposedly the streets down town or something were alot of one ways, and it
was easier to load out otf the left of the vehicles.  this akron thing may
be true.
