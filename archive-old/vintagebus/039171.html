Michael did you ever get the safaris?

hi, phil and list

I'm afraid I didn't. 

My 3 000 mile road trip/parts mission ended 300 miles from home when
some paper (not left there by me and denied by the builder) was sucked
into the fan housing of my very new and very expensive engineer built
engine. There was massive overheating and cylinder three siezed.

I was so over budget after repairing the engine that I wasn't left with
enough cash to make the trip the kind of no holds barred blowout that I
had planned. 

So rather than returning with a doublecab load of rare and exciting
parts I have the same full of whiskey and beer bottles.

The engine builder denied responsibility for leaving the paper in the
engine bay and given that the stuff is of the same type as is to be
found at every service station in the country I can't really push it. 

Just so that you all don't think I'm a complete fool, I was doing an
anal run in procedure and apart from many oil changes I was cheking the
engine out every 50 miles or so for signs of overheating or leaks. I was
in and out of the engine bay 6 times at least before the overheting hit
and there wasn't a scrap of paper to be found.

I suspect that one of the engine builder's workers was tasked to do an
oil change when I brought the bus in for the mandatory inspection
service 50 miles after I had installed the new engine.

After spilling oil out of the filler neck he would have mopped the oil
up and then to save time he would have flung it over the top of the fan
housing. This would explain why I didn't see the stuff after carrying
out three oil changes as well as his extremely sheepish look as the
offending paper was hauled out in front of his boss. 

Think of this as a cautionary tale or something!

later 

Michael
