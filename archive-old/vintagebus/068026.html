Subject: NOS door - more pics

Thanks Karl and Ronnie for the input. I think both of
you are right. I popped the door panel off DARTH (67)
and it looks like I either need a diferent door, or
some mods.

Check out the comparison of the latches:

And the NOS door has the hole in the jamb for the door
limiter/hold open, but no inside bracket for the
mechanism

The flat part on the outside handle cove is curious
for sure. Maybe VW only made that skin after 64, and
the inner half of the door was different depending on
early/late.

Anyone want to trade me for a 67 dry, straight door
with good hinges?
