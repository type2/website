Subject: FAO Schwartz new toy.

Hi All,

This weekend the girlfriend drug me to the mall.  As I dragged my feet
through the mall, and she complained about me dragging her to bus shows
and she didn't complain, we happened to go into FAO Schwartz.  If you
haven't seen an FAO before it is incredible.  I cruzed through all of
the stuffed muppets, to the car toy section.  Meandering through the 10
different new beetle remote controlled cars (one was about 2.5 - 3 FEET
long, and about a 1.5 FEET wide), I came to the FAO mechanics shop.  (A
cabinet full of the top of the line new Hot wheels and Match box).  And
there it was, an FAO Matchbox box set that I hadn't heard of or ever
seen before.  It has an early bug, a new beetle, and aconvertible new
beetle, so what you say!!  It also had a

Turquoise and white 23 window.

Freakin cool.  I was stoked.  Girl friend was pissed, because they also
had the Radar set with the 23 window (I bought both), and my B-day and
Christmas are both coming up.

Have fun,
Aaron
