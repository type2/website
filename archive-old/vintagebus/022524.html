Hi All,

I'm still catching up on my email as my trip around the country has netted me
over 3,000 emails to catch up on.  As I've gone through the mail I noticed
the &quot;Restoration Observations&quot; thread and I had sent a quick quip to Erin &quot;No
Quarter&quot; that most restorers keep multiple projects going at one time.    I
was
sort of jesting, but it is true.  Most businesses work this way to stay
afloat.
They like to call it multitasking.  If a business were to wait on one project 
only, it wouldn't take long for them to go belly up.  And believe me, my
business
likes its employees to multitask like mad!  :[   So when you're waiting for
that all important part from BFE to arrive, you can be sanding down that panel
on your other project or find something else to do on the same one you think
is stalled.  Or, you can maybe help someone else work on their VW and maybe
gain some knowledge in the process.  They'll probably want to come back and
help you with yours when you're ready to move on with it.   I'm sure most
of you can find something to do with your project(s) when you are stalled
on a given task.    Speaking of which, I know many people try to keep all
of what they have to do in their heads.  This just isn't practical.  That's
why you forget the other tasks you have to do.  Sooo, make a task list of
things that have to be done on the project and post them on a big &quot;To do&quot; list
in your garage, your office or your bedroom.  Keep a copy of the list with
you in your wallet or whatever so that you can glance at it when you need
to.  This way, you are managing your time and project yourself without
someone else having to tell you what's next.  It keeps the project(s) on
track.   And if they all happen to get done at the same time?  So much
the better.

Now, if I could only follow my own advice.  Trouble is, my work load over
the past few years has been astronomical.  I have a list a mile long, but
work keeps me there 10 - 12 hours a day.  Does anybody out there have a
solution for not needing any sleep?    ;)

Steven

&gt;I agree totally.  First step in a resto is through out any and all
schedules.  they will not be  made for many different reasons.
Organization, patience and time are the key ingrediance.
