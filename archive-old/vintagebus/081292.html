Subject: Re: [VB] manual choke

This is the carb that Clara installed in her 65 a while ago - manual choke -
but there is an electrical connection on it - maybe for the 12V idle jet?
I'm wondering where that wire should go to - coil?

I've been having trouble getting my bus started.  It hasn't run in about a
year.  I just noticed that wire on the carb isn't hooked up - think that
could be my problem?

TIA

&gt; Hi Jdd,
&gt; If your carb is a manual choke it will have a spot on the forward left 
&gt; side
&gt; for the choke cable sheath to be clamped to the side of the carb.
&gt;  If you have an electric choke there is a wire connection on the rear, 
&gt; right
&gt; side of the carb.  this wire comes from the ignition switch to the 
&gt; electric
&gt; choke and goes onto the the coil.
