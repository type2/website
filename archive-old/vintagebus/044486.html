&lt;&lt; Are these washer bottles unique to Buses? I've been looking for one for my 
Super Beetle, and I haven't found one. I saw one once that sold for $250 or 
so. It had all the attachments for use, and I thought it was neat. But not 
$250 neat. What do these bus bottles look like? &gt;&gt;
Hi Don,
Yes they are.  
Try      http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260476211
for a view of one used in 1964-67 buses.  The style used from ? to 1964 had 
scalloped instead of straight knurls on the black plastic top ring.  Also try 
Ebay by entering VW washer bottle for a bottle for your super.  Eric&amp;Barb
