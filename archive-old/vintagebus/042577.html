hi all,

I was sick of my clutch acting up and wanted to install my thermostat, so
i pulled my engine out sunday.

Put in one of those bugpack super heavy duty throwout operating shafts...
this was a pain in the ass.  the new bushing that came with the kit was
the wrong size (too long) and didnt fit well in the transaxle so i had to
grind it a bunch to get everything to fit back right.

I have the pinch bolt style clutch shaft, and it turns out that the new
arm the groove for the pinch bolt was in the wrong place, so i had a
splined curved arm laying around (luckily) and got everything back
together, now my clutch works perfectly :)  Before i couldnt get it
remotely close to adjusted right without shimming the clutch adjusting nut 
like 3/4 inch away from the arm.  Nor its spot on! and i got a diaphraghm
pressure plate, so no more knee busting 9 spring...

So i get the thermostat stuff all installed, and put the engine back in.

I rock the bus back and forth and hear a loud clunk from the transaxle
pushing forward and reverse, and it doesnt sound good.  It _could_ be due
to having a loose drum (car moves a bit due to loose drum and bad splines
then ring gear goes clack when it catches) but this is probably being
optimistic :(

So anyway i say *sigh* and start it.  Instant unholy racket!  i stop the
engine... look for anything amiss, and start it again, again instant
unholy racket. No more starting till i figure this one out!

Im *hoping* i just left a nut in the bellhousing, or maybe my new pressure
plate is hitting something in there etc. but turning the engine
by hand it feels an awful lot like a screw fell down the carb and worked
its way into the cylinder. Then again, i've never had that happen before
so im not sure what it would feel like, heh.

Anyhow, if i have time tonight i'll remove the engine and take a look...
but i'd say i may have a bit of work ahead of me this week :(

take care,

Steve
