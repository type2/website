&gt; Q: Do I maybe have an odd wheel that requires a different seal, and if so, 
&gt; how do I find out what I've Got? 

Hi Don,
You could have a 1968-71 bus drum which needs a special seal to adapt it to 
the earlier spindle or you drum had been damaged or aftermarket junk that was 
machined improperly.  Measure with a 6&quot; calipher and check with your local VW 
FLAPS to see which it is.   Eric&amp;Barb
