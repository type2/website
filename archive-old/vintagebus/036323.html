&gt;From everything I've read, I think I'd like to try a vac-adv dist in our new '67 Micro Bus (to replace the existing 009).  I'm hoping it will improve the idle, since, from memory, the vac-adv dizzies adv at idle.  This is a DP 1600 with 34 PICT-3 and headers and breathed-on cam.  She barely idles with the 009 set to 34 degrees total, but twisting the dist towards adv certainly helps at idle, but not at runtime.

My question is, where to find these vacuum advance dizzies?  If I get one from a junkyard, can I test it on the spot by sucking on the tubes (to see if the plate moves) and checking for play in the shaft?  Are replacement diaphram units available?  Where?
