After being here for the past eleven years driving my
'67 Squareback, then a '80 Westi, and occasionally
my strange '64 Ford F100 CrewCab, the folks here
think it weird that I am currently driving a plain old
Subaru, a few times a minivan, and now once in 
a while a real mainstream 4Runner.

They all know I would rather be in a bus!
