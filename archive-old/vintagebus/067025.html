Subject: Ghia Wanted

I apologize for this marginal subject matter but if I wait til Friday she may
change her mind, anyway...Yesterday, I still can't believe it happened, my
wife actually said to me: &quot;I think you need another VW project, can you find
me a Karmann Ghia?&quot; (My 71 Westy hasn't needed work for a long time so I've
been kinda bored, theres some mandatory bus content!) As I stood there
stunned, she went on to tell me that it would be nice to have a really cool
Ghia to cruise around in after she finishes her Doctoral program in about two
and a half years, and that that would give me time to restore one for her
really nicely.
So anybody in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee,
Illinois, Pennsylvania, or anywhere else in that general region have a PROJECT
ghia for sale?  Condition is not too important, engine is even less important.
Ideally it would be something 68 and up and not have fatal rust plus
relatively cheap, other than that, I'm pretty much open to anything, after all
I am going to have two and half years to finish it. I also have some bus and
bug parts that can be included as bartering pieces. As part of a deal I can
also help you out with mechanical stuff you may need (T1 engine)such as engine
R&amp;R, clutch replacement, brakes, etc. Let me know if you got something!

Peace, John Baker

headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
