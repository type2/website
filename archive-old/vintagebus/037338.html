Hi Volks,
Just below is a small, but pertinent part of a report on High Content Zinc 
Rich Primers.  Below that is just the first two pages of the NASA corrosion 
report on High Content Zinc Primers called ZRP's (Zinc Rich Primers.) in this 
report 63 pages long!   Eric&amp;Barb


For over 25 years, the process of coating testing at KSC to identify 
materials for the long-term protection of carbon steel structures has taken 
place at the Beach Corrosion Test Site near the Space Shuttle launch complex. 
The atmosphere atthe launch pad is highly corrosive due to the proximity of 
the ocean, heat from rocket exhaust, and now with the Space Shuttle, the 
acidic combustion products from the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB’s). As a 
result of previous long-term.
94-2082 2 exposure tests, ZRP’s were identified as the best choice to provide 
long-term protection of launch structures and ground support equipment at KSC.
Testing requires 18 months for prehminary approval, and continued good 
performance for 5 years for final approval.

1.0 SUMMARY
This investigation explored the use of EIS in combination with atmospheric 
exposure at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Beach Corrosion Test Site near the 
Space Shuttle launch complex as a short-term method for analyzing the 
performance of 21 commercially available ZRP’s. EIS measurements were 
collected afkr different times of atmospheric exposure and analyzed by 
finding an equivalent circuit to simulate the data. This analysis yielded 
several parameters indicative of physical and chemical behavior for the new 
and aged primer ti. These parameters were analyzed and summarked to help 
categorize the behavior of each material. A correlation was found between the 
long-term performance of ZRP’s and several parameters loom the EIS 
measurements; work will continue to xfine the evaluation process and improve 
the
prediction capabii of this technique.
2.0 FOREWORD
2.1 For over 25 years, the process of coating testing at KSC to identify 
materials for the long-term protection of carbon steel structures has taken 
place at the Beach Corrosion Test Site near the Space Shuttle launch complex. 
The atmosphere atthe launch pad is highly corrosive due to the proximity of 
the ocean, heat from rocket exhaust, and now with the Space Shuttle, the 
acidic combustion products from the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB’s). As a 
result of previous long-term.
94-2082 2 exposure tests, ZRP’s were identified as the best choice to provide 
long-term protection of launch structures and ground support equipment at KSC.
Testing requires 18 months for prehminary approval, and continued good 
performance for 5 years for final approval. EIS has been used previously in 
the LO-MSD laboratories on bare metals and on ZRP’s. The samples formerly used
for testing were flat, 0.16 cm (l/16 in) thick carbon steel coupons, 1.59 cm 
(5/8 in) in diameter. These previous EIS measurements were collected afbx 
various immersion times in 3.55% NaCl and did not include atmospheric 
exposure. This investigation explores the use of EIS in combination with 
atmospheric exposure at the beach corrosion test site as a short-term method 
for analyzing the performance of ZRP’S.
2.3 Paints containing zinc dust have been used since the middle of the last 
century.’
The zinc dust was originally combined with zinc oxide as a graying pigment. 
The basic nature of zinc and its oxides caused reactions with acid sites 
present in the natural polymers used as bonding materials at that time. These 
reactions resulted in premature polymerization. The advent of synthetic, 
non-acid functional binders made possible the high pigment loading of tic.2 
This development gave rise to a class of coatings referred to as zinc-rich 
paints. These coatings contain a high percentage by weight of zinc particles 
(between 75% and 95%). The binder may be either organic (e.g., epoxy, 
chlorinated rubber), or inorganic (e.g., a solvent-based ethyl silicate or a 
water-based inorganic silicate). Initially, the zinc provides cathodic 
protection to the steel substrate (galvanic effect); whenever there is a 
break in the coating, the cathodic action tends to protect the steel 
substrate from corrosion. Many times, where scratches or damage to an 
inorganic zinc coating have occurred, the zinc reaction products have 
proceeded to fill in the damaged area and seal it against fbrther exposure.” 
As exposure time increases, however, the galvanic action becomes less 
effective. The deposition of inhibiting zinc compounds at the base of the 
coating pores, followed by the sealing of the porous
structure by the zinc corrosion products, results in what is referred to as 
the barrier mechanism of protection. The galvanic and the barrier effect both 
must undoubtedly occur to ensure long-term protection of the steel 
substrate.4*s

3.1 A model 378 electrochemical impedance system manuf&amp;tured by EG&amp;G 
Princeton Applied Research Corporation was used for all electrochemical 
measurements. Electrochemical measurements were performed on 10.16 cm x
15.24 cm x 0.32 cm (4 in x 6 in x l/8 in) carbon steel test panels. 
Twenty-one panels were coated with the ZRP’s listed in Table 1. The materials 
included in this investigation had been rated previously at the 36-month 
exposure point to
determine their degree of corrosion performance on a scale of 1 to 10 
according to ASTM D610, with 10 being the highest rating; this rating is 
included in Table 1.
