OK, some oil info to start:

oil viscosities are determined by putting the oil into a container,
bringing the oil to a specific temperature, and then opening a measured
hole in the bottom of the container.  The longer the oil takes to drain
from the container, the greater the viscosity index number.  Each index
number implies that the oil falls into a certain range of viscosity
measured in &quot;Saybolt Universal Seconds&quot;.

There are two different viscosity indices, one for summer measured at 210F
and one for winter measured at 0F.  The winter viscosities are designated
by the letter &quot;W&quot; after the viscosity number.

Multi-viscosity oil has been modified chemically so that it doesn't
thicken as much when it gets cold.  It is designated by both the summer
and winter measurements such as &quot;10W-30&quot;.  This indicates that the oil
meets both the specifications for 10W winter oil and 30 summer oil

The only viscosity index that exists in both the summer and winter scales
is 20, but 20W is a completely different specification than 20.  All oils
get thinner as they are warmed up, but multi-viscosity don't thin out as
fast.

That being said, I've been using 10W-40 oil in my new mexican engines.  In
looser engines, I use 20W-50.  This is in a mild SoCal environment with
occasional forays up north.

You really can't go far wrong, considering what they had for motor oil in
1938!
