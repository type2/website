Subject: Re: [VB] 79 Westy - Cleaning the Fiberglas Top

...
After you wash it try using a polish made for
fiberglass like those made for boats. The NAPA near
murder burger might have some! The only other options
available would be to paint it or re-gel coat it.
Gelcoat is expensive and very cost prohibitive.
Interlux makes good paint from what I have heard and
it is stocked at most marine stores, but try the
polish first it works great.

&gt; Hi Folks:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really new to this list and to VW Bus ownership.
&gt;  This Spring I 
&gt; picked up a 78 Westy which had been serving a
&gt; colleague well for two 
&gt; years as a tool shed.   The bus was in surprisingly
&gt; good shape, runs 
&gt; great and has almost no rust.   One problem, the top
&gt; is pitted and 
&gt; faded a dirty streaked gray.  I will be washing it
&gt; this weekend but 
&gt; was wondering if anyone had an idea what to use to
&gt; re-whiten and 
&gt; re-seal it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; BEN
