Subject: brake progress (was moaning and clicking)

Thanks to all who offered advice on my brake dilemma.  After backing 
off the e-brake, and re-adjusting all the pads, setting the 1mm play on 
the mc push rod, and a third round of bleeding, I've now got brakes 
that are working, and my pedal now travels 1/2 way before stopping on 
first pump.  (before, it went to the floor, and only pumping away could 
get it to this point)  I'd still like the pedal to be higher, so I 
guess I will have to remove and inspect the mc.

Question:  What part of the mc would be causing this delay in the 
brakes taking hold?  (I've got the Bentley as a resource)

...one day and half a brake pedal closer,
