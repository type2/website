 anyone help out here?  These are all for a stock 65 Samba
restoration i am working on.

1.  Did the middle and rear seat clamps have wing nut's or regular hex
nut's?
 -- - -   -- 
passenger buses like yours have hex nuts, only kombis had wingnuts.
////////////////

2.  Did the front and side door inner handle bezzles have a spring
behind them the take up the slack from the door handle post?  I have
room there but do not remember taking any springs out.  I know my 60
crew cab had them.
. . . .. .. . . 
the cab door handles for a 65 had a square of foam (about an inch thick?)  
with a hole in the middle beween the door and the panel.   earlier buses 
(from the pin handles I beleive perhaps that was the change) had a thick 
spring.

before  attaching your cab door panels, make sure that the front part of the 
door mechanism (which you had already removed, cleaned, re-greased and 
re-installed)   is correctly oriented, so that you lift the handle up to open 
the door, otherwise someone will lean on the handle, and open the door while 
the bus is in motion, and think it spontaneously opened itself.     If the 
handle opens the wrong way, reach inside the door and flip the front piec of 
the mechansim around so the rod is either below or above the mech I forget 
which, but opposite of the way you had it when it opened by pushing down.     
makes sure it opens nice before assembling the door panel. the bit by the 
door handle can require slight positioning before the screws are tightened 
down.   

Trivia question:  Anyone know when they went to phillips screws from slotted 
ones there?

  Do use plastic between the panel and door, tucking the plastic in the 
bottom of the doors, to keep the panel from warping.  then put the foam 
square on, then the panel.


The cargo door handles have a thin spring between the door and the chrome 
ring.   The cargo doors had chromed rings, the cab doors plastic rings, 
regardless of it being a deluxe or not.

3.  Did the rear seat have the metal protector strip screwed to the
outer top edge along with the aluminum luggage bar or just the aluminum
bar?
. . . . . . .  .
think just the bar, would have to check for that
//////////////

4.  What do you all use to clean up original floor mat's?  Armorall?
. .  . .. . .  .
simple green and a scrub brush.    If the mat is dry, I use glycerin.   
Glycerin really restores rubber items, and even works on the VW buses' real 
vinyl leatherette seats.     Good for your hands too.      they say armoral 
is evil.
////////////////
5.  Anyone have a source for German Square weave grey S&amp;P carpet for the
rear cargo area besides Wolfsberg West?
...............
I dunno, please tell me when you do. 
////////////////

6.  What do you all use for the carpet spacer under the carpet in the
cargo area in between the metal reinforcement rib's?  (To make the
carpet even back there)
...........
strips of the black thick tar paper felt stuff-   perhaps it is sound 
deadening too.
/////////////////////////

7.  What direction did the inner door handles face?  Both front and
rear?  I think straight down for the rear and back for the front doors.
Theses are the long crome handles
. . . .. . 
the cargo door ones are straight up when the doors are latched closed.

The front ones point forward and slightly up.
