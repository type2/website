Subject: Parting out '56 Kombi

I picked up a '56 Kombi over the weekend and will be parting it out. The
rear fender wells and front turn signal metal is already spoken for, but
the rest is up for grabs. I'll have sheet metal, tranny, suspension, og
cloth and rings for the heater tube (Mr. Mayes) as well as some glass,
and electrical pieces. Pictures tomorrow. Let me know if anyone needs
anything.........
