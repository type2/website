The 15th annual Spokane Bugfair is June 27th at the Spokane fairgrounds
&gt;from 10am-3pm.  Don't know about the entry fee, but I think it's something
like $10, but don't quote me on that.  Neat swap area, with lots of cool
stuff, but nothin' like those big Calif. shows!
The day before is an autocross at the Dakota Direct parking lot (don't ask
me where that's at).
Everything is going smooth as far as I know.
