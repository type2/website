&gt; That's it.  I think that's even how the manuals describe it.

Yeah, me too... I've never had a lug loosen or tighten, and I just use the
above technique - I invented it myself as it seemed sensible. I added
anti-sieze to the procedure after one lug stuck one time decades ago.

Maybe this is the proper way of doing it.
