Posting this again.  After what I saw people trying to sell at Bug-Out,
this is a good deal.

	I guess I'm going though one of my &quot;be honest with yourself&quot; phases.
Here's the scoop-     I've had this bus for almost a year and haven't
gotten around to doing anything on it.  Tired of listening to my wife gripe
about it, and don't know when I'll ever honestly get the time to give it
the attention it deserves with all my other ongoing projects.  Might as
well sell it for what I've got in it.  Maybe one of you guys will have more
time than I do for it.  Here's the details:

1965 13 window Deluxe Microbus for sale: Good shape overall, frame good.
Rust around bottom sides and front.  New tires and some parts for
restoration, working 12v refrig. Good restoration project.    $800
