David &quot;psycho wheel collector&quot; ;) (Those Raders looked neat!) writ:
&gt;While in SanDiego a month ago, I spotted a bug with what looked like Fuchs
but upon closer inspection, they were of the wide 5 205 mm bolt pattern and
not the closer later style Porsche pattern. Anyone know if these are real
Fuchs or are they some repop item.&lt;

I am sure those are some sort of knock off wheel.  There have been many
repos done of the Fuchs wheel and are super cheap to pickup used because
they are junk compared to a real Fuchs.  Fuchs wheels are forged and are a
very durable wheel, great for racing.

Real Fuchs will have a fox head symbol on the back of them next to all the
serial number junk.  Also some, maybe all, have a &quot;born on date&quot; stamped
back there also which is neat.  Fuchs were way ahead of their time, I
believe introduced as an option on the 911 in 1969 or 1970, and no one else
made forged alloy wheels at this time... And for many years after that.   If
you are interested in the whole story Excellence did a history of the Fuchs
article sometime in late 2000. 

Basically the repos are great for the busses since there is no speed or
cornering concerns, it is all for looks.  Save your money and get the repos,
99.9% of people cannot tell the difference.  Keep the real Fuchs for Porsche
cars.
