Subject: got the trans and motor in today

we got the motor put in my single cab today. we had rebuilt thre trans, put kits in the dual kadrons and just a general clean up of the engine compartment. i went with the sta lube 80/90wt. gl 4. it fired up on the first crank just like it always has ,so i guess we did everything alright.i also installed a empi steering wheel {the type they made for datsuns and tiotees} it looks pretty kool even if i do say so myself. we will get all the little things done tomorrow {change oil ect}still waiting for my berge shifter to come in. we have a cruise this saturday to westphalia texas , the temp just dropped from around 80 to 65 so it should be awsom weather for a cruise
