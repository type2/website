Sorry, don't have any for sale.  I'm beginning my search for some but thre were zero curtains in my bus when I bought it.  Of course I would love it if someone out there had a source for it, but I'm assuming that is a long shot.  What would be very helpful is if anyone had some original yellow curtain fabric that was beyond use, but could send me a swatch of it so that I know exactly what I'm looking for.  A piece near a hemline would be prefered, so that I could open it up and hopefully find a less sundrenched piece that had a *truer* color.

If there are any other SO-23 owners out there with the yellow/black color scheme looking for curtain fabric let me know and I'll keep you informed of my search.

TIA.

Robert
