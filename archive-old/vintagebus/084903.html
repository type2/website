Subject: Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg dipstick oil temp
  sensor

Aircoolers,
I can turn on the oil temp light (the oil reaches 227 degrees) after
driving 4 miles uphill floored at 60mph when the engine is warm at the
bottom. It is a pretty serious hill and when I do the test I pass the
big rigs which climb at about 45mph loaded.


At the top the VDO gauge gives heads temp of ~375degrees. Since
outdoor temp is ~80, heads temp is more like 385degrees. This is not
necessarily exact since VDO gages are not always precise.

I'm wondering whether this is called overheating or whether this is
what you get when you drive a type2 camper with a type1 engine. Please
share your opinion/experience. Is anything wrong with my baby ??

When I drive normally (i.e. 55-60 on the flat, whatever less uphill)
the oil temp stays below 227 degrees. Head says about 350.


Some infos on the setup
I have checked the GB sensor for accuracy, it triggers right around 227
degrees.
