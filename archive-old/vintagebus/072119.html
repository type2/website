&lt;&lt; Once an old bus
 has been brought up to spec, it should last forever with minimal
 maintenance. If they didn't I wouldn't own one. &gt;&gt;

yes they sure do!   However, I have never bought a bus that didn't have lots 
of delayed maintenace to deal with.  Sounds like she knows this and is willing 
to pay to get it fixed, but got the pits for a mechanics.   I really hope she 
gets a good one soon.

talking of delayed maintenace, I replaced the shift coupler in my 67 riviera 
today.    It has been parked since vintage meet, due to hard to shift to 2nd,  
and popping out of 1st, 3rd, and even once 4th.  Since one day it was fine, 
and a few days later it was crud, I hoped a shift coupler would fix it and it 
wasn't the tranny.   The 67 deal is I had to disconnect the front coiupler to 
slide the rods forward enough to remove the old rear coupler, and the front 
bolt broke off!   curses!!!

So I drove it up on ramps today to get lots of room under there.  I blocked 
the back wheels, ebrake on. put the bus in 3rd,  disconnected rear coupler and 
pulled shift stick back and undid teh stick in teh cab.  Then got out the 
grinder and face sheild and ear muffs, and sliced the front coupler lengthwise, 
then turned the tubes and did it again.   pulled the pieces off. 

drilled down into middle of broken off bolt, then got needle nose vise grips 
on it and pulled off the nub in there.   Torched where the front and rear rod 
were stuck together, squirted water on it.  repeat torch, rinse.   Vise grips 
on rear rod (which is solid) and another pair more gently on front (which is 
hollow) and they twisted apart.  :)   removed front rod.   old rear shift 
coupler (sandwich type) now came off easily.

Made hokey dust covers out of old brake cylinder dust covers, which get hose 
clamps on to the shift tube ends.  the old ones were toast.   installed rear 
coupler.   wire brushed rust off front rod, and used a piece of old clutch 
cable on a drill to knock as much out of the tube as I could (turn drill 
backwards)   Blew tube out with shop vac.   All this rust coloured dust blew out the 
back.    installed missing middle bushing, front bushing was fine.  greased it 
all up and put it all back together.   

Whew!!!

Test drive to the package store revealed tighter shifting, easy to shift to 
2nd, and no popping out of gear.   :)

okay, I guess I'll drive it around again now.   Hm, better wire the little 
square 8mm nuts though.

This took MUCH MUCH longer than the book time would have said it should.   
Once the delayed maintenace it done, it should be easy.  This bus is still 
getting there, though.
