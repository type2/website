Good ole VW, making more enemies everyday.....

They are selfish jerks these days, I would love to have a conversation with
the head honcho, but I'm afraid it would be hard to keep from getting
physical with him...What ungrateful people they are....

The &quot;People's Car&quot; has turned into a car just like all the others, offered
by a company with no support tyo those who got them where they are today...
I would not own one if it was the last form of transportation, other than
horseback......

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Well Volkwagen of Amercia hit me with a cease and desist  legal warning
&gt; this morning. ...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Hopefully for awhile that will satisfy their need to harass people trying
&gt; to keep alive the very vehicles that they show virtually no support for.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Kelly, you know, I think Volkswagen is just wasting their time chasing
&gt; all the small-time users of their name.  The truth is that the Volkswagen
&gt; name is out of date, what with its 1930's lumpenproletariat overtones.  VW
&gt; would do much better just to let everyone use their present trademarks and
&gt; pick a new name, more in touch with their present corporate identity, and
&gt; which no one else would want to use.
&gt;
&gt; How about, say, Philip Morris?  Its present owner doesn't want the name
&gt; anymore, it has built-in brand recognition, and nobody else will want to
use
&gt; it.  And best of all, it fits their new corporate style.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Grant
