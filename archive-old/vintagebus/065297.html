&gt; At this point, it looks like _delving deeper into full timing_ is where we

&gt; next rig:  A vintage Bluebird Wanderlodge bus!  Massive and needs lots of
&gt; attention.  The &quot;True American&quot; way of approaching the &quot;German Westy&quot; :)
&gt; Engine in rear, special engine that needs special care (two stroke diesel),
&gt; requires few but very strong tires, known to leak oil, etc.   A few notable
&gt; philosophical differences:  Living with everything you need instead of just
&gt; essentials, plus 80 gauges instead of zero.  Obviously travel is more
&gt; limited more by both expense and space.


&gt; Quick disconnect / Folding Towbar
&gt; ====================================
&gt; Anyone have experience / recommendations on a quick connect/disconnect tow
&gt; setup for a splitty?  Something you can fold in and hook-up/disconnect in
&gt; only a few minutes?

With a huge rig like a Wanderlodge, I would seriously consider a trailer
for the towed vehicle.  You can unload a trailer faster than you can
disconnect and fold a towbar

Advantages:
No wear and tear on the bus drivetrain.
You can back up with a trailer, not with a towbar.
The trailer will handle better.
Separate brake and light systems on trailer.
Less damage from thrown objects with the bus on a trailer

Disadvantages:
Added cost for trailer
Added registration fees (though some states are very inexpensive)
More tow weight (not really an issue with the Bluebird)

If the Bluebird can handle the tongue weight, I would consider a T-trailer
like the dune buggy folks use.  This is a skeleton trailer that consists
of an axle and long tongue.  Two platforms are attached just aft of the
axle to hold the rear wheels of the bus.  A roller will have to be
fabricated under the axle to ride up the tongue and lift the front wheels
of the bus as the bus is driven onto the trailer.  This trailer is very
simple, tows like a dream and is very easy to back up with.  The
disadvantage is a lot of tongue weight (probably 1000-1200 pounds with a
bus).  A T-trailer would be a lot easier to disconnect and handle by hand
than a regular trailer.

&gt; The brakes might also be an issue, especially if we load up the Westy.
&gt; Anyone have experience linking the brakes?  Is it even possible on a
&gt; splitty?  I've never towed anything before, so excuse my ignorance.

I wouldn't even consider it.  The Wanderlodge is so heavy that the bus
will be fine even without brakes.
