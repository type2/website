Hey Volks!

This mail is a little overdue. Two African bus news events: Firstly, a
couple of weeks back I entered my splitscreen panelvan in a rally!

The rally is the second running of an annual event called the Africa Beetle
Rally. Check out their website at www.beetlerally_dot_com It is an all-out race
over about 7500km around Southern Africa, taking in South Africa, Swaziland,
Botswana and Namibia.

The rally is open to any carburettor-fed air-cooled Volkswagen. The serious
players treat it as a race, while the rest use the event as an excuse for an
air-cooled VW touring holiday, with full parts and tech back-up. I won't be
racing my splittie, and we'll probably make full use of the 15 days allowed
to complete the route.

The second bit of bus news is that in April I met a young Norwegian who was
just leaving Pretoria on a trans-Africa journey in a stock 1959 Kombi. His
name is Espen Svensen and he had already spent the past few months touring
Southern Africa and working as a diving instructor on Lake Malawi.

His current journey is Cape Agulhas to North Cape, or the southernmost point
in Africa to the northernmost point in Europe. The bus is a 1959 RHD Kombi,
completely stock apart from a 1600 engine. The journey is scheduled to take
just two months with a projected cost of US$2000.

I'll file his first trip report separately.

Enjoy!
