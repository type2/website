Hi Seth, 
Depends!  1963 model year offer as standard the 1200 40 HP engine with  air 
cleaner slung on left side of engine via a bracket bolted to the shroud by  the 
coil bracket bolts.  Unless Eberspacher heater was installed and then  this 
air cleaner was slung to right side and bracket bolted to gen tin  bolts.  This 
air cleaner would use a all metal tube from carb to air  cleaner.
 If one wanted in 1963 one could special order the 1500 engine  and this came 
with rubber tubed air cleaner that hung from a bracket welded to  the engine 
compartment ceiling and to the right of the engine.  This style  air cleaner 
was standard here in N. America in the 1964-67  years.
