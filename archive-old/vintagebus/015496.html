:  buy a 14mm spanner, cut it in half, and use the shortened spanner to tighten

Would it be possible to get one of those ratcheting wrenches in there?
I mean the box end wrneches with a rotating mechanism, not a &quot;normal&quot;
ratchet.  Haven't had to deal with this problem on the '60 yet, so
thought I'd check first.
