I'm viewing the BBB photos page right now.  Man - it's absolutely awesome
that these pictures are being shared with us.  You almost get the sense that
you are there yourself even though in many cases we're thousands of miles
away.  Thanks to whoever took these photos and posted them - was it you
Ronnie?  What a great way to share this event with others in an almost
realtime fashion...
