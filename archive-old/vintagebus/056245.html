Subject: RE: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

It's all relative.
I guess you could even have an 'All Original Repop Parts Restored Bus'

I would venture to state:

    term               meaning
1. factory original:   unrestored... this wouldn't necessarily mean restored
2. restored original:  used original parts (note I didn't say nos)
3. restored vintage:   used vintage parts during resto (i.e. like the 59 dc)
4. restored            used what ever.

I'd say that '64 dc falls under the 'Restored' category.

John pondered:
Am I the one that's confused? On Everett's site there's a 1964 crew cab for
sale from Georgia.
The owner states: &quot;It was restored about 8 years ago and garage kept since.&quot;
Then in the same paragraph he writes &quot;It's all original and about as nice as
they come.&quot;
As far as I know, &quot;restored&quot; and &quot;original&quot; are contradictory terms.
Or has this changed since I left school?
