Hi Curt,
Yes it is!  Though to grommet it properly you more likely will need to remove 
the engine.  We tried standard hardware store gommets and they only lasted 
about two weeks before letting the metal fuel line touch the engine sheet 
metal when the new grommet cut in two from the vibration.  Need to find 
harder sturdier grommets.  For now we take a 2-3&quot; length of fuel line slit it 
lengthwise, and then slip it around the metal fuel line and through the hole 
in the forward engine tin with slit upward.  To secure this in place you hose 
clamp the fuel line and it take the vibration.  After two+ years the fuel 
line just starts to show wear from the tin.
