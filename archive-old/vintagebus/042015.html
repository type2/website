&gt; 
&gt; I actually take exception to this statement that mechanics and dealers are
&gt;&gt; the biggest supporters of &quot;clunker laws.&quot;

Well, here in California they were quite prominent in the fight to crush
cars for &quot;pollution credits&quot;.  When their organization is called the &quot;New
Car Dealers Association&quot; It's kind of hard to hide their intent.  They
also made sure that cars taken under the program would not be parted
out, but would have to be destroyed.  I've seen several buses in running
condition go to the crusher this way.

I don't doubt that there are individual dealers who don't agree with their
association, but their voice seems to be unheard in the quest for profit.

&gt; As far as inspections go, for the most part here in NC, they are somewhat
&gt; of a farce. We regularly see cars that are in nowhere near &quot;passing&quot;
&gt; condition, with new stickers on them. I believe that if they are
&gt; properly done, they can be a benefit,

Why?  What makes the inspector more knowledgeable about my vehicle than I
am?  Why should I have pay someone else every year or two to prove that I
am innocent of driving an illegal vehicle?

&gt; but few are done that way. We are instructed by our state Division of
Motor Vehicles to raise every car in the air and inspect suspension,
&gt; steering and exhaust systems, as well as tires,  for potential hazards.
These components are more of the inspection than is the emissions at this
&gt; point since only a few areas in NC are classified as emissions areas,
requiring the hookup of analyzers for inspection. At this point we are only
&gt; required in Asheville to verify the existence of emissions control
devices on the cars. The real problem is that the state mandates a charge
&gt; of $8.25 for an inspection, plus $1 for the sticker for non-emission
&gt; applications. Do do the inspection properly would take more than 30
minutes.
&gt; Most shops around here charge $50-70 per hour of labor. $8.25 does not
begin
&gt; to cover expenses, resulting in less ethical shops just glancing the car
&gt; over and putting on a sticker. Hence the farce.
&gt; South Carolina recently repealed annual inspections, and we have
supported
&gt; either doing the same in NC, or revising the system to make it uniform
and
&gt; practical.

So, it seems that if you were allowed to charge $50 for an inspection you
would be all for them.  Your only objection seems to be that you aren't
allowed to charge enought for them.
 
&gt; Just my two cents, but it is too easy to vilify automotive professionals,
 when most of us are collectors ourselves and we are on the same side.

Well, when they're pushing laws that are hazardous to my enjoyment of my
vehicle it is very easy.  Why should I have to make an unneeded trip, let
a stranger fiddle with, and possibly damage, my bus, and pay them to tell
me something I already
know just to line the pockets of the &quot;inspector&quot;?
