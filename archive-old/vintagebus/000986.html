This message is a public thank-you to &quot;Uncle Jerry&quot; Jess for his suggestion that  I contact Michael Steinke while  I was in Frankfurt recently. As it happens; I visited with Michael on the afternoon beore he and his club &quot;Bulli Kartai&quot; left on their 15th annual relief trip to eastern europe. This year a group of split-screen through EuroVan buses, led byMichael's well-cared for 67 Westy will be delivering medicine, blankets, childrens toys,clothing and other donated supplies to .....Romania.  I'm sure many listees have heard of the Bulli  Kartai's convoys in the past; they have delivered materials to such devastated areas as Sarajevo and Croatia. As Michael told me during our brief visit. &quot;When you see people this poor; you can't help but take ownership of {their situation}
and want to do something.&quot; Michael owns the blue 1955 school bus that has been published in....as well as a 19++..., a 19++,and a 19++ in addition to the Westfalia he's driving on this year's &quot;Bulli's......&quot; (&quot;Bulli's Bringing Joy&quot;).
