Plumbers use shiny chrome discs with a bolt hole in
the center to cover small holes in a wall where access
to a cleanout or fitting is needed.  Two of these of
appropriate diameter, installed one on each side of
the tin, held together with bolt and nut and washers,
might be satisfactory,  with maybe some thin
weatherstripping or silicone caulk behind them as a
seal and cushion.
