While installing new seals on my 21 Window, I now have a large crack on =
my drivers side window.  Would you know it, the other window was not =
near as good shape (bubbles between the glass) as this one was!  I =
always seems to work out that way.

Oh well... now to find spare glass.

On ebay found spare glass for the skylight windows _at_ current bid of =
$2.11 for those whom might be looking for them:
