Subject: Re: Polarizing new generator?

&gt;
&gt;The diagrams i see indicate DF and D+ are towards the back when they
&gt;really are towards the pulley.

The pulley *is* the back.  Front is front...

&gt;Hook DF to some D- screw located on the generator body towards the
&gt;pulley. I do see a ground screw towards the rear of the generator.
&gt;From the D- screw to the battery. Is this the right screw?

That ground screw is D- .  It should be screwed into a tapped hole right
in the casing of the generator.

&gt;And to run for &quot;HOW LONG&quot;

Bentley says &quot;a short time&quot; and Muir says to just &quot;touch&quot; the connection.
I'd guess that five or ten seconds is probably good.  When you do this the
generator shaft should spin - you might disconnect it when the shaft seems
to have reached a constant speed.

&gt;Is this the correct procedure.

Yes.
