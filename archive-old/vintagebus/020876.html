I had my bus sodablasted and it works great, although
they must use sand on any of the rusty areas.  Soda
stripping removes the paint without etching the metal.
 They blast baking soda at high pressure and the soda
explodes when it hits the surface, taking the paint
with it.  It will not harm chrome trim or rubber
however.  The City of Chicago has a fleet of trucks
with soda blasters to remove grafitti because it
removes paint without damaging the bricks of
buildings.
