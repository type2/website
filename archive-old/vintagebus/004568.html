Unfotunately, in the auto industy, saftey is the &quot;in&quot; thing.  People want to
be so safe when they drive, they end up with air bags, side impact
protection, jelly bean cars, and generic eggs on wheels - the pinnacle of
Ralph Nader's reign.

You have to be an adventurous person to want to drive a VW bus.  The risks
presented are very real but you have to be that much more of a defensive
driver.  Imagine your ancestors in covered wagons - they were the true
pioneers.  They didn't go very fast in their wagons unless they went down
hill, spooked the horses, or got washed down stream and sure - some if not a
lot of them died but it was an adventure they lived for and couldn't be
satisified without.  All this not to mention they needed wagons for
transportation.

The risks of driving a non-jellybean vehicle are real but that is what makes
owning an old vehicle an adventure.  Like in flying - there are risks if you
are not a safe pilot.  As far as I know, airplanes don't have side or
frontal impact protection - you've got to keep your eyes open, don't fly if
you don't feel well/capable, and be a damn good flyer.  Likewise when you
drive your bus, you've got to keep your eyes open, don't drive if you don't
feel well/capable, and be a damn good driver.  Even in a nasty head on
collision, you're gonna die no matter what you are riding in.  So if your
vehicle isn't safe, don't drive it.  If your vehicle is safe, drive safe,
drive slow (hey - no problem in a bus right?), and you otta be okay.
