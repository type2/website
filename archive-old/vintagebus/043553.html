&gt;I've gotten jumps from 12 volt cars into my 6v bus....no problems that
&gt;have come to light yet. Although I have heard you need to make sure all
&gt;your electrical stuff is off when you try to start (except for the
&gt;ignition)

I have done this a couple of times to my '64 and it works.  Now that
I have changed the battery cables I won't need to anymore.  :)  Some
points:

* The last jumper cable you hook up WILL spark.  The usual order
is + dead, + good, - good, block dead.  On a Bus it's harder to
hit the block, although you *might* be able to get one of the
rear generator pedestal bolts or rearmost case half bolt - 
careful of the belt!  Or, clip to the bolt on the right rear
opening brace where the ground strap is.  The idea is to have
this spark not happen right over the battery where there is
potentially hydrogen gas.  It's a pretty decent spark...there's
quite a bit of current flowing.

* Have everything in your Bus off.  When you put the key to the
first click your warning lights will be bright!  Crank it over
and try to have the other person unhook one of the cables (usually
the negative one on your Bus) as soon as the Bus lights off.  This
cable will spark again when unhooked - don't worry, just get it
unhooked promptly.  The oil light will go out but the generator
light will flash brightly until the jumper cable is unhooked.

* If the car giving you the jump is a newer model, say 1990 on
up, there may be a plastic cap like a milk bottle cap over the
side-terminal battery bolt.  Just pull it off and hook up your
jumper cable.  Also, on some cars, the positive battery post 
isn't accessible with the battery installed.  Usually there will
be a clearly marked terminal, covered in red plastic, marked
&quot;JUMP START&quot; or &quot;AUX BATTERY&quot; or just &quot;+&quot; somewhere in the
engine compartment near the battery.  This is where your red
jumper cable goes (possibly after removing a plastic or rubber
cap).
