&gt; &lt;&lt; Why is there a different fuel pump for the 1600 DP depending on whether
&gt;  you have an alternator or generator?  Is one interchangeable with the
&gt;  other?

The exact reason is that if you look at the difference between the diameter
of the alternator and the generator and take into consideration that the
alternator stand is shorter than the generator stand, the alternator will
hit top of the generator type of fuel pump.  The shorter squattier fuel pump
allows for the alternator to hog up all the space it needs.

Interesting to note though is that if you take the top off of a generator
fuel pump, all it consists of is brass dome with a fuel spiggot on it.  I've
very carefully taken a ball peen hammer and dented this &quot;dome&quot; to clear the
alternator before and ran it quite successfully.  You can run an alternator
fuel pump on a generator equipped engine and and the generator fuel pump
will fit in a tight pinch on an alternator equipped engine (using the
ballpeen hammer method).  Keep in mind that it is a tight fit when you
modify the pump and depending on how tall the studs are in your case will
depend on whether the modificiation works well or not.

Whenever you swap fuel pump types, the fuel pump pushrod must go with it.  I
believe the alt. fuel pump pushrod is 100mm and the gen. version is 108mm.
