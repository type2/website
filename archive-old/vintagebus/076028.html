&gt;Hi Craig,
&gt;It could be the oil cooler is blocked up internally. ...Perhaps the
&gt;passage to the oil cooler is partly blocked.  Did you remove all the oil
&gt;passage plugs and inspect for properly cast/drilled passages??  Not sure which
&gt;side of the type 3 cooler the oil pressure hole is but it could be on the side
&gt;that is coolest.  You really want to measure oil temp before it is cooled to
&gt;know what is going on inside the engine.  You might want to try a 
&gt;type 4 cooler
&gt;and 356 Porsche generator pulley.

  thanks for all the responses!  as of the build up, the oil cooler 
was fine; i have a pressure tester to check for leaks, and i ran 
parts cleaner thru a medium pressure hose through it to look for 
restriction - fine on both counts.  when i first cranked it over, i 
pulled the sender to make sure oil was flowing through the cooler 
before firing it up.
the plugs on the case were all pulled and internal passages were 
cleaned, but that doesn't mean sumpin isn't wack inside a passage i 
couldn't see. i'll have to dig out my spare T3 cooler, but i'm pretty 
sure the sender hole is on the cooled (exit) side; i wanted it that 
way specifically to see oil temp at the bearings. just another data 
point i thought i'd look at; i have other senders i can try on oil 
sump, etc. so it IS possible that a short drive is heating my case, 
but the oil cooler is doing a good job... maybe a longer drive would 
raise that temp. this would imply that the aluminum case is absorbing 
more oil heat faster than the stock al/mag case, and just doesn't let 
it go as quickly. a longer drive would heat up the oil eventually in 
that situation.

i'm still not sure about the pressure tho. at start, i get 90 PSI, 
and it usually stays that way for a while at speed (3600 rpm); it 
will eventually drop to 75 or so. idle speed (2000rpm) will yield 
pressures from 15 - 30, usually higher than not. i am running 
valvoline 20-50 racing oil - the stuff in the silver bottle.  i was 
happy with it in my last motor. the pump is a berg blueprinted 28mm 
with a pressure relief cover, so  i need to check with tim at berg to 
see if he finds this pressure acceptable.  if not i would expect the 
oil pressure piston is stuck, and is bypassing the cooler. the other 
oil piston would result in LOW pressures, so it must be working... or 
at least stuck closed :P i have built one other (stock) engine that 
had nice high oil pressure, but it would drop from 90 to say, 60, 
within a few minutes.

the head temp readings make perfect sense, which is what throws me 
off; 325 to 375 depending on speed and road conditions, creeping to 
400 or more on long hills or in a strong head wind. this gauge has 
NEVER varied from these readings in 10 years  and i trust it 
completely (when the sender starts to go bad, i get readings more 
like 250 - 300 and i know it is time to order a new one). USUALLY the 
3 things work in concert: head temps creep up, then the oil pressure 
reading starts to fall, then the berg sender comes on. i can monitor 
all three and drive to keep em where i want em (i drive to the head 
temps, not the speedometer), but in this case one variable is solid, 
one is possibly too high and another is way out of line.
  if i had NO oil cooling, the pressure reading should drop like crazy 
as the oil overheats.
if i have an intake leak, the head temps should be higher, and again, 
the oil pressure should start to fall. also, my air/fuel meter should 
be reading lean, whereas it now reads just a tad rich at speed.
  if the bypass in the pump is stuck open, it should be sending oil 
right back to the inlet side, and i would expect lower pressure again 
- i could be wrong here, tho.
if the aluminum case IS absorbing heat from the oil  faster than 
normal, then i may be just dandy - at least for short trips!  if this 
is the case, i'd have to disconnect the berg sender. by the way, this 
is a berg shorty, which goes in a plate where the T3 dipstick would 
go... i'm going to try the dipstick sender this weekend and see if it 
makes a difference.
if the AL cases simply run 220 rather than 200 degrees, i'd have to 
try and modify the berg sender to go off just a little later.

again, any other things to look at would be cool... and if you know 
someone running an AL case, have em contact me :)
