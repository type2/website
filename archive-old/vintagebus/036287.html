I wouldnt want to sell any of mine to someone oversees because i would surely 
love to see the bus finished sometime down the road but if that means that 
someone across the pond may be losing out on the enjoyment of my bus, I would 
surely offer it up. If it was just a VW dealer or something I would rather 
keep it at home.

So i guess it all comes down to money like always. Its just like at the swap 
meets. I find a part I have been looking for forever that I need badly and 
have just enough money for it and someone comes and offers more than I have 
and they get it, Jerks!

Do whatever you want, it's your bus! though if you put on fender flares or a 
tire on the front ill make fun of it ;) oh boy
