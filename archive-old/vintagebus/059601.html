Subject: Re: [VB] REV LIMITER?

&gt;Hm, not sure how they work, but they do cut your revs from going over a
&gt;certain amount, which you can adjust.

if i recall from the various workshop bulletin copies listees sent me, they
work on manifold vacuum pulling against a spring or diaphragm or
something.... basically, it turns a vane to choke off flow thru the
manifold below it, choking the engine.  i'll try and dig em out
tonight............
