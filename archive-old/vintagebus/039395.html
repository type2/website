Hi everyone,

     Does anyone know if the hardware on a popout window (on the sides of 
busses) will operate on pop outs on a bug?

Also, How often are listees looking for those little triangles for the back 
of trailors?  I have found a whole mess of them, and would be willing to 
sell some.  I also have a place that I can get them.  I'll up load a picture 
if anyone is really interested, but They are the small triangle, and are a 
red reflector (like on a bicycle)

Thanks,

Matt in Pa
