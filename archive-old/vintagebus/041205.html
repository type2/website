Good weekend buslist,
I should just pretend that today never happened. This morning, as I
sunk my hiney into the freshly reupholstered bench of my 1964 Sundial,
the day seemed ripe with promise of fun, relaxed, activity that had
nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with wrenching on the damn bus. My
dreams quickly faded when I turned key in ignition and sat there
listening to the sounds of my starter doing its work, but nothing else
rising to the call. That's just not right.
Got gas because I can smell it. Got air because I think I would have
noticed the lack of it. Don't have spark. Juice enters coil but won't
leave. Get new coil. Easy to write, but took me a while. Upon return,
in a frenzy of eager carelessness I reverse wires to compufire and
make compuembers. Dammit there goes my stupid $. I am back to points.
Now the bus is pretty much microcircuitry free, given the absence of
radio, cell-phone, CB, computer, GPS, and whatever else.
I try so hard with the points. I do. Dizzy on workbench I would swear
they are at 0.016. Dizzy in car, the little digital dwell / tach thing
says right about 0.42. Did it again with identical results. Gave up.
What do I listen to, feeler gauge or digital meter? Can someone please
give me a little primer on the use and care of points?
Thermostat system seems to work great. I watched the little bellows
expand as the engine warmed, maybe 5-10 mins. I watched the bellows
contract as the engine cooled, much longer.
Oil bath air cleaner didn't work out. The fitting for the carb that I
have is for an air cleaner on the right side, and my hanging bracket
is on the left. I just couldn't make them meet up. It is good that I
have patience because otherwise a certain over-valued big bucket of VW
metal would find itself rusting in the river right now. I am going to
some show in Angel's Camp CA (near home) and can maybe find the right
bits there. Otherwise its chrome city for me. Oh please no.
I have one of those VDO tachometers. So maybe my bus isn't really high
tech free. I bought it a while back thinking it was important for
something, I forget exactly what. Today I find that while the digital
meter says I idle at about 850rpm, the VDO says 1200. I have been
concerned about over-revving my engine, since the VDO says maybe
4500+rpms at 60mph. But now I don't think so much of the accuracy of
the VDO and would like to ditch it. Never could figure out a good
place to put it either. But maybe it is the little digimeter thing
that's the problem? I am certainly not having a digitally successful
day. I am right at the point where I don't want to deal with it
anymore. So I ask you volks, who I trust more than cheap electronics
(I don't know if it's a compliment either):
How fast can I drive my bus? How fast can I cruise my bus on level
ground without putting undue wear and tear on that little engine? Is
60mph for hours on end a reasonable request?
The bus is 1145666 with 15&quot; wheels and a 1600dp single carb motor. No
overheating problems or any of that. I have the stock tranny with the
RGBs, clearly designed to allow a little motor to pick up and move a
big load, not to go fast on the interstate.
Thanks everybody, rant concluded, 10 days to Alaska trip, not even
close to ready, goodnight, have a great Sunday.
Joel and the _____ 1964 Sundial
Ps. I have good days too.
