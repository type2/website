Subject: bought a '57 micro!

Hey gang!  Just got back from picking up my new bus!  It's a 1957 micro
and it's the most rust-free Volkswagen I've ever owned.  The front floor
is a little cheesy, but the rest of the bus is almost perfect, since the
previous owner had replaced the cargo floor and probably the rockers (very
professional).  It's missing the middle seat, has the wrong bumpers, and
doesn't have the original tail lights, but it sure is cool!  It came with
a 1600cc sp that runs really good, and it has a custom gauge cluster with
oil temp, amp, and fuel gauge.  And this is the first bench seat bus that
I have owned so my babe can snuggle next to me while I'm driving 
:) :)!  Pics will be available soon on my website.
