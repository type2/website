&gt; You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
&gt; take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17 Sept 01
&gt; and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to get the
&gt; magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed in 2
&gt; weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came in.
&gt; Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the wait.  A
&gt; month to a month and a half would have been understandable.

Most of the stuff I've ordered from Bus depot have arrived in short order.
There has been an occasional delay for one part or another, but that is to
be expected with parts for 30-year-old vehicles.  Why don't you ask Ron
about the delay?  He can probably explain what is going on to your
satisfaction.
