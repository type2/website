I had a good time too, once I got there. After telling everyone to look for
the 'original' Zebra bus, it ended up sucking a valve in San Clemente (that
place STILL has the bad Nixon vibes I guess) and I sat on the side of the
freeway. Well, luckily I was caravaning with about 12 other SV2s members,
so one of them stayed with me while I called the tow truck. Thanks to
Stupor Bowl Sunday, no one wanted to tow me all the way home, so they
offered to store the bus up there and tow it down home today. Still no word
on status, though. I've called and this was the conversation...

&quot;Can you describe it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah...it's a big Zebra lookin' VW Bus!&quot;
&quot;Oh...&quot;

So, I'll be calling in a minute. sheesh! I ended up winning a really nice
single cab toy at the raffle though! So, like I said...I had fun.
