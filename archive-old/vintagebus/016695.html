Hey all,

I adjusted my valves sundays and put in a new set of points 2 days ago as 
well as set my timing.  Yesterday bus ran like a champ with the absence of 
brakes like usual.  About 8th of a mile from my house I ran out of gas on 
the top of a hill and rolled backwards a 100 yards or so parked and got gas. 
  I kept my accessory lights on for the coast backwards.  I have been real 
careful not to use the accessory due to past experiences with frying points. 
  Do you think that short of a time is exceptible to fry a brand new set of 
point.  Due I have a super hot coil?  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Eric
