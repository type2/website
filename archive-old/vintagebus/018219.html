Ok, we're getting into a very delicate issue here.  I've tried to
let the thread run it's course, but now I'm seeing people doing
&quot;me too's&quot; but with the wrong shop name!   I don't want to
squelch the complaining, nor do I want to appear to be taking
sides.  I have my own opinions and favorites about online ordering,
but I have to have a bit of &quot;separation of church and state&quot;
when it comes to administering the list.

People: if you're going to bitch, fine.  But before you do,
please walk thru a gripe &quot;checklist&quot; first:

#1 do everything humanly possible to resolve the issue before 
taking it to the list.  I mean everything.  So don't automatically
assume that if someone doesn't respond to your email within 
/n/ hours that you've been blown off.  From what I've seen, the people
who run these shows are not necessary the most computer-literate
that I've known.   Don't hold that against them.  When in doubt,
go analog and pick up the phone.

#2 please allow enough time for #1

#3 if you do decide to escalate to the list, couch the first 
query as a &quot;does anyone have any experience dealing with XYZ&quot; -
the replies to this post will help give you an idea if yours is an 
isolated experience, or if you're dealing with a chronic deadbeat.
You should also encourage replies via pmail instead of to the list.

#4 if you decide to go for the Big Time and pitch a complaint
(which is perfectly OK) then PLEASE make sure that you have
all of your ducks in a row.  When you write your complaint, read it back
to yourself, imagining being challenged on each point.  If you
can't substantiate a given charge, then perhaps you should drop it, 
or at least soften it.  Make it a point to accurately describe
the time frames involved, the specifics of the order, and what
you felt was wrong.  For instance if you ordered $2500 worth of
rubber, and they sent you 1 windshield seal instead of two,
that's worth making a note of.  Likewise if you ordered a windshield
seal and they sent you a super beetle taillight lense, that's
also noteworthy in a different way.  Both examples would help your
audience determine the degree of error.

Lastly, figure out - before you post - what you'd want the 
shop to do about it, because I can almost guarantee they will contact you.

But by golly, if you do nothing else properly, you'd better at least
get the name of the business right!

Thom
