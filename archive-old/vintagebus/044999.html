It may have come off the arm for the TO bearing.   I have had this happen, and pulled the motor to fix it as it was too awkward for me to do it elsewise, though I am sure some skinny armed doublejointed person who can see around corners can.   But you can check to make sure the ciclip is still on the TO shaft, holding on the arm the clutch cable goes through on the tranny.   if it is gonr the arm may well work its way loose and it will feel like the clutch cable is broken, but it is not.

oh, wait you were talking about the front of the bus, ignotr what i just wrote
