&gt;No offense meant, but why didn't you directly talk to Randy himself before
changing the information based on hearsay??
&gt;Steve

The conversations went on for weeks between me and Bryan and I could tell
from comments made that Bryan knew him well (which he does) And Bryan put
all his contact info which is authentic. Plus the fact that Randy's email no
longer worked, and despite my adds posted, and attempts made to contact
Randy, no response. So of course how can you contact a guy that is
uncontactable? Randy used to put up adds every week on thesamba_dot_com then
they just dissapeared.  It just all made sense I guess......
Anyways, all straight now. Just a friday story for your listening pleasure.
