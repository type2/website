Subject: Help with 64 Westie Interior
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My husband and I just bought our first splitty, a 64 Westie in ruby red with a vent roof. It is fairly complete but  has lower rocker panels that are rusted out. The interior is fairly complete. We have begun a restoration and are facing a few challenges. Does anyone know where we can get repro fabric for the interior ( plum, yellow, white plaid or red curtains.) My couch fabric is original but is pretty dirty my curtains are shot and need to be replaced. I am also looking for replacement trim for the edge of the cabinet door openings. A friend of mine said that he once saw a guy at a swap meet that made aluminum reproductions of the trim. Any ideas???? I also need a table and the associated hardware. Naturally, I like everyone else am looking for a tent (Red/white stripe please ;-)  ) If anyone has any leads please post or e-mail me. I am willing to pay top dollar for original Westie parts in excellent condition
