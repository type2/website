Subject: engine probs

 hello i was wondering if anyone had any advice concerning my particular engine problems. i have a 1600 single port completly stock woke up to go finish my christmas shopping and it would run fine for 10 to 15 seconds and then stall. i took out the carb and tore it apart everything is working fine there, no fuel delivery problems at all. adusted the valves the intake 1 &amp; 3 cylinders was closed and the exhaust #2 cylinder was closed rather odd cause it is a brand new engine about 2300 miles and i just did a valve adjustment about 600 miles ago. but after the valve adjustment it ran really crappy sounded bad and now the engine wont even start but it will turn over. i just adjusted the timing yesterday, and all the electrical connections seem to be fine, i just redid alot of the wiring about 2 weeks ago. anyhoo any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated and thank you very much in advance, i got to get home for the holidays so i am in kind of a bind. merry christmas to all
 and a happy new year and be safe out there on the road. 
 
 sincerely
 isaac tait
