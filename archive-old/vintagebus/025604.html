&gt; One thing I forgot to post about on my previous step #4 post, is that I'm
&gt; having a hell of a time seeing when I weld.  I can have a nice seem all set
&gt; up, and then when I'm done tacking it, I didn't do a bit of good because I
&gt; proceeded to tack weld out in the middle of nowheresville.  Is there a
&gt; product made like a crayon that glows when it receives UV light?  Or should
&gt; I get one of those LCD shields?  Anyone else have this problem?  Thanks for
&gt; any advice you can lend...

I switched over to the instant darkening lens and my welding improved about
100%, I could see where I am starting and don't have the false starts 1/4&quot;
away. When I turned down the current to the lowest level (for body metal)
there was another improvement. Practice on metal coupons also helped greatly.

Good luck on the welding
