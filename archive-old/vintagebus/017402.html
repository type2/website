Two-tone is where two different colors are used; in buses, it's 
traditionally one color above and including the beltline, and 
a different color below.  Earlier buses would have the dark color
on top, later buses had the light color on top.

There are also irridescent colors out there now, various pearl clear coats,
and this wacky metalic/perl/??? from BASF that's pretty cool.  But now
we're talking about lowrider and riceboy paint jobs...
