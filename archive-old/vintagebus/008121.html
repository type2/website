Thanks Woody for the invitation. I had no idea there are so many VW nuts in
my area. As far as parts and prices, I'm surprised to hear that prices here
would be lower. I'd assume that So. Cal. should have lower prices since
there are more of parts and buses there. Here you don't see too many. Well,
I'm sure I'll be at the shows and meets although for the time being in my
F*rd at least up until the time my bus rolls off the assembly line. I hope I
get to meet you all. Thanks.

Later,

&gt;         Hey Andre,
&gt;
&gt;             With all due respect,once show season begins( May)there is a
&gt; show every weekend,pretty much,and every show has a swap meet. Now, every
&gt; show may not have a huge swap meet but many do!
&gt; Also my experience is that here in the midwest you may not have the
&gt; abundance of used parts,as Ca. does, but you also won't pay &quot;inflated&quot;
&gt; prices as I have seen being paid for items at Ca. swap meets.
&gt;         Also if you would consider joining our bus club &quot;Der Busbesitzer
&gt; Gruppe&quot; you would have the added advantage of bartering with fellow
&gt; members.We are now over 80 members strong and growing!
&gt;         I look forward to seeing you at some shows this summer!
&gt; Go to our clubs website and look at 2000
&gt; events,the list of happenings is long!  http://www.dreamwater_dot_com/dbg
