Subject: Re: [VB] 21/23 Split manual question

For the '67s there appear to be two manuals.  A fellow on eBay sold a
mint condition '67 deluxe owners manual last year and it went for around
$140.  The cover photo was tinted an orange-yellow color, I believe. 
Whereas with my '67 doublecab I got a commercial manual (cover bus looks
like a panelvan) that has a cover photo tinted blue-green.

&gt; There is a guy on ^Bay that is selling a 63 23 Window manual. I was
&gt; asked by someone if this was the last year (i think it was) for a
&gt; sunroof specific manual. Or if you bought a 21 split in 64-67 did you
&gt; get a unique manual? If so, was it in addition to the standard
&gt; transporter manual - or was it the only manual you got.
