Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing front window rubber

I have not used por 15 to do this or anything, so I have no clue on how good 
it is.  The crucial idea to to get rid of rust, and leave a smooth sealing 
surface.   no granular surfaces.  so I tend to use some spot putty to fill in 
little dimples after removing rust and priming.

ALso, you'll want some masking tape and newspaper, to tape off the buses dash 
before you start spraying things near it.In a message dated 10/11/2002

 I have is whether I should use the POR-15 on the surface of the dash which
 is visible.  Will it be really thick and noticeable if I only cover the
 ~2&quot;x2&quot; rusted area?  I know POR-15 is supposed to be hard as a rock but when
 I do get the bus paint redone can it be sanded down with reasonable effort
 so that the dash is smooth again?  Would I be better off not using the
 POR-15 in that area?
