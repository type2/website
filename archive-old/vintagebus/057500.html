&gt; This is FANTASTIC!! actual, real results!!... i am into tuning turbo
&gt; vehicles using dyno's and there are so many little things that can change

&gt; many different opinions as to what is right and what isn't, it will be
&gt; really nice to finally have info backed up by Ronnie's data logging instead
&gt; of what someones brothers, cousins, great-uncle's bus runs!
&gt;
&gt; HATS OFF TO RONNIE FOR SPENDING ALL THE TIME IT TAKES TO SET-UP, RUN, LOG,
&gt; CHANGE PARTS, SET-UP, RUN, LOG.... and on and on and on!

Of course he had that nice dyno.  Did y'all expect Ronnie to just polish
it?  :)

Thanks for the real world info, Ronnie!

Any chance of running one of those stock Mexican engines?  I want to know
if my seat of the pants estimates are accurate!
