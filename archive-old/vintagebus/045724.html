&lt;&lt; How different/similar is the tar to the spray on undercoating?  It was my
impression that at least some of the spray on undercoatings are basically
diluted tar.&gt;&gt;
Hi Rob,
All of the present day undercoatings that are spay as far as we have seen are
made of plastic and/or rubber type of materials.

&lt;&lt;  I suppose others are plastic based materials.  I agree that the plastic
based materials will do as you say and eventually let moisture in.&gt;&gt;
Right they in the end will turn into real nightmares.  Plus if there is an
accident and body work needs to be done the tar just removes with a little
kerosene.  While the plastic/rubber undercoating is much harder to remove and
we have not heard of any easy remover for them.

  &lt;&lt;If I were to use tar, does it have a smell? &gt;&gt;
Yes, and no.  We paint the floor pans inside and outside of our type 1s.
There is a tar smell for about two months.  After that it seals up and no
longer smells at all.  Have tar in our restored 1963 K. Ghia and never get any
comments about tar smell from those who get the nickel tour in it.
