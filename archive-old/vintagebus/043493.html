Hello all!

While shopping at the local ACVW junkyard today, I grabbed the 9
prong box off of a 12v Bug.  Tonight I took it apart and satisfied
my few lingering curiosities about it.  It's a well-made little
device.  Most importantly, I found it can be replaced by four relays
and a generic turn signal flasher - you can even leave out one of
the relays if you're not a purist (the effect will be that your
turn signals will work even with the key off).  Suitable 12v and 5v
(for 6v Buses) relays can be found brand new for about $3 each,
and a turn signal flasher should run $2-$5.  For the 6v version,
you'll also need a resistor or voltage regulator for the coils
(another $1-$2).  Add some wire, push-ons, and a mounting arrangement,
and you're looking at about $15 to $25 for a 9-prong box replacement
that will do everything the original box (and the $50 and $70 replacements)
do.

If anyone is interested, let me know, and I'll work up a detailed
wiring diagram and specs.  Thanks!
