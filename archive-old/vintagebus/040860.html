Hi there OC Bus Owners,
I would just like to invite you all to join OC Vintage Vee's, an aircooled
club for residents of the Orange County area.  Membership is free and there
are no fees whatsoever.  For more information visit www.ocvv_dot_org.

We will be having a meeting this Sunday (the 11th) at the In-N-Out in the
Tustin Marketplace.  Anyone is invited to join us.
