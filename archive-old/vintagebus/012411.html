I wanted to end this thread before it actually began; Friday
is OK, but if it turns out anything like the one on RAMVA or
the Porsche list, it isn't pretty.

What in the hell am I talking about?  VW and Porsche are
on a rampage, shutting down all sites with VW or Porsche in
the name.  There's lawyers involved.  It's ugly.
