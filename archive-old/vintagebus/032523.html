[...] no negativity, i just gathered since he want to know what they were
supposed to be, he might like to know that they weren't white.  anyway,
isn't a vast majority of reflection/refraction done by the bulb? what one
person thinks &quot;looks good&quot; drives other people nuts. so, yes, variety is
good, but if wanting stock info and not getting it from a &quot;vintage&quot; site, 
where else to turn?

&gt; Yeh, and some people don't. But we don't hear from the &quot;non-stock&quot; people 
&gt; enough on this list. Seems like if you mention something that's
&quot;non-stock&quot; 
&gt; a negative vibe is sent your way.
