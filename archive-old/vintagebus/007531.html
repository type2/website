The engine I posted about a few days ago that I was given has the same tin
with the cylinder numbers, but it has been determined it is a 1600 single
port....could it have the tin from a 40 h.p.? I'll have to look at my 60
single cab with the stock bastard 40 to see if it has the same tin....just a
curiosity.

&lt;&lt;Bastard 40 h.p. only!


&lt;&lt; Also the cylinder tin has humps on it with the cylinder markings on

them 1 2  3 4 are stamped on raised humps, I have never seen this before,

enlighten me. &gt;&gt;
