apart from the rims and the running gear, yes it is original.  I saw that bus 
before it was dumped, an amazingly low milage (kmage?) bus that used to be an 
airport bus, I believe for hauling luggage out to the planes.   Note the 220 
m code- for mountain gearing, if you're hauling lots of weight at low speed 
give it low gearing.   

I've seen a couple double slider splitty sunroof deluxes that were normal 
paint and interior. and a double slider 63? panel.

franken-bus??
