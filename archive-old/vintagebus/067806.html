Subject: Re: [VB] inside the aluminum case from hades

possibly - it would have happened during breakin, maybe during cranking?
------------------------------ Clip ----------------------
Oil foaming normally happens at High RPMs, High Heat or overfilled crank
case.
Consider a windage tray when you put it back together to control some of
the crankcase oil issues.
When you get ready to restart this engine, leave the spark plugs out,
crank it over until you get oil pressure and I think I'd put a tube on
the oil pressure port and pump some oil into a jar and see if I was
getting anything like trash passing through the galleries.
I build my engines with assembly lube but prime the oil pumps with STP,
seems to be thick enough to pull the initial vacuum to get the oil flow
going and build pressure quickly. Others say pack it with Vaseline and I
agree that would work fine too.
I notice that your oil pickup tube is still in the block ...............
pull it out and be sure the O ring is in good shape and the bore it fits
into is smooth. (A little air coming in at that point would cause
foaming, low oil volume although you might still have good pressure.)
