&lt;&lt; -it is an original paint decklid and the emblem even has those stock 
little O-rings on the inside. Is this a decklid an original for those 1500 
optioned busses in the earlier 60's-(it is a church key lid?) It's 
interesting and I just wan't some info? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
It was issued as an accessory for the special Mcoded, and those owners who 
had installed the 1500cc engine in 1963.  The bus 1500 emblem has a more 
ovalized &quot;0&quot; in than the type three 1500 emblem.  Then for sale here in N. 
America (Not certain about Mexico.) the bus had the 1500 installed at the 
factory as standard, but in Europe and other parts of the world that were not 
oil producing countries (Where petrol prices were, and still are four to five 
times higher than in the US.) the 1300 was the standard engine in the bus.  
Somewhere about 1964-65 the 1600 engine was an option for some Euro countries 
buses, and so the 1500 emblem for the bus was altered to 1600.  We have seen 
quite a few of the 1500 emblems, and only two of the 1600 over all the years 
we have been in VWs.   Eric&amp;Barb
