Subject: Re: [VB] '61 deluxe pics-dash colour

My April 61 15 window has a red dash.    I am not sure of the exact date of 
the change, but the 61 and earlier two tone buses had the dash the lower body 
colour.   Also the insides of the doors- that area above the door panel below 
the window frame- is the lower body colour.  My 61 was hit a few years ago 
and the $&amp;*%$* smashed the drivers door- It now has a door off a 62 (3?) with 
the area there just above the panel beige grey.   The 62 (63?) bus it came 
off was a SWR/BG 23 window (that had had the sunroof left open in the rain 
for over ten years- sorry dead) with a BG dash.

This was a topic before - and I tried to do a survey on 61/62/63 bus owners 
whether the dash was originally top or bottom colour- I think it was around 
the 62 model years beginning, I'd have to dig up the numbers- though there 
were gaps.   all the 63s had dash the upper colour I believe

&gt;  OK, now I'm thoroughly confused.  I took a look at Adam Bruno's '61 pics
&gt;  as I'm working on Jessel soon, (also a '61 15 window) and I noticed the
&gt;  dash was red.  I asked him about it and he said that it was originial. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Now just last week I saw my buddy's '60 23 window at his shop, also with
&gt;  a red dash.  He said it was repainted and should be white.
&gt;  
&gt;  What is the deal?
