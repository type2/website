Subject: Re: [VB] Re:  coffee names

&gt; Checking in before hand and getting an EPA disposal permit for the coffee
&gt; you don't sell might not be a bad idea.

Is coffee toxic  :)  Since I already have an established coffee shop /
espresso bar / coffee roaster in Spokane, WA.  Any unsed beans will come
back here to be used in shop.

&gt; You are also subject to inspection by local health department officials
&gt; and those can be trying times

Indeed.  Some of the local &quot;authorites&quot; regulations are a bit silly
somethimes, but I understand they have the interst of the public in mind.  I
have a book of regulations for Spokane county ( we are pretty tough here)
and i think I will be OK around the west side of the US.    I plan on
getting all needed permits.

&gt; The coffee truck conversion sounds like great fun but you may find that
&gt; all preparation and sales under a portable tent are the most financially
&gt; practical way to go ................

The actual coffee / espresso making will take place out of the back hatch
area of the bus.  The bus in essence will act as a counter for the macine
and a storage area for water, supples, sinks etc.  All other activites will
actually take place under a portable tent setup.    Most of the whole &quot;bus&quot;
thing is really jsut the novelty of the vehicle.

&gt; Best of luck on your endeavor.

Thank you.  I actually have a pretty decent set of VW customers the frequent
my shop.  Some come to look at my bus, others just think I make the best
coffee in town.  It does not surprise me that you don't see any busses in
front of Starbux.  You also don't see beat-up ford pintos either.  I think
that the drivers of busses in general have better taste than to go to the
McDonalds of coffee houses :)  Just my .02, but I am a little biased.
