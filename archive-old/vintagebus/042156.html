&gt; There has recently(last couple of years) been a setup created by a guy in
&gt; Everett Washington that allows you to attach a spin on Oil filter setup that
&gt; attaches to the stock oil cooler location and sticks out through the lower
&gt; front part of the Fan Shroud.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure why these have not caught on much yet, but I expect it will.

Several problems that might pop up:

1. If it is in the cooler circuit it will not be a full-flow setup.  It
will filter the oil that passes through the cooler only.

2. If it is in series with the cooler, it will restrict oil flow through
the cooler, raising temperatures.

3. If the spin-on filter sticks horizontally out of the fan shroud, how do
you remove it without giving your engine a major oil bath?
