So the replacing of the front wheel bearings went pretty well, they were
all discoloured and a couple were pitted really badly, tho now I seem to
notice more sloppyness in the steering.  I haven't really looked to
closely at it, maybe I will today.  Maybe I should replace the fluid in
the steering box - I topped it up last fall with 80-90w and I read
somewhere only 90w should be used?

Anyway, I'm wondering about my rear bearings.  I was told they should be
repacked and I do notice a &quot;howl&quot; sound from back there.  But the &quot;howl&quot;
is about 30% of what it was before the front bearing replacement :).
The Mango has no interior or insulation and tires (205/65/15's - I
think) that need replacing soon and I'm very inexperienced with
diagnosis via sound.  So I should just go in as far as the first set of
bearings in the rear, right?  No need for me to go near the reduction
boxes, right? *gulp* Other than to check fluid levels, right?  Do I need
a puller of some sort to get the ball bearing out?

So should a bearing be replaced if it shows any discolouration at all,
or is very minor discolouration and a very small pit or two, OK?  I
guess I know the answer to that.

anyway thanks in advance
