&gt; Hi George,
&gt; We use a product called Brake Kleen on both our brake shoes and
clutch discs
&gt; when affected by oil.  This product gets out all of the grease/oil
from the
&gt; friction material

Brake cleaner is basically alcohol, and I wasn't aware that it would
clean oil out of friction material.  Good stuff if it can!  For clutch
friction plates I tend to replace them whenever it's open so I seldom
face the cleaning problem.  Pretty much the same situation with brake
pads/shoes.

Back in the bad old days I tried using Muir's advice of soaking oily
brake shoes in white gas and lighting them afire.  This seemed to work
fine on the old riveted asbestos brake shoes, but I wouldn't try it on
modern bonded organic brake shoes.

&gt; and we have found that it will drop instantly wasps when
&gt; encountered in the junk yards.

Now _that's_ a unique usage!  

George Lyle
