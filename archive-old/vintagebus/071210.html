Subject: Thank you

I've been a fellow &quot;listee&quot; for over a year now and I've made a few
observations.  First, I want to send a special &quot;thank you&quot; to those of you who
answer our questions on a regular basis.  (Erick and Barb, Clara, Ray, Ronnie,
Matt, etc.)  Many of us realize that you spend a great deal of thought and
time in responding to our questions.  It's people like you that keep this
hobby (obsession?) going!  I hope to meet you all some day and personally
thank you for your contributions.  With much appreciation....Steve (66 SAMBA)
