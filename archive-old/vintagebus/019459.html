In reality, my '54 has very little rust left.  There's the rear corners,
the area above the engine lid, the passenger windshield pillar, and
a couple spots on the seat pedestal.  That's it.  Everything else
has been removed.  The singlecab I brought home a few weeks ago has more
rust than the '54 does, by volume.
