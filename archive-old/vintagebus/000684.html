 I'm gonna be doing the carpet thing in my '59 Kombi. It'll be on the area
 over the engine, down the hump, and on the floor of the cargo area. It'll
 also be on the area the front seat sits over, down that hump, and on the
 cab floor........

I would stay away from carpet and any padding that can be spongelike and hold 
water, particularly if your bus seeps or leaks water -at all-, or it rains 
where you are, unless you mind rust and mustyness.

just MOPBO
