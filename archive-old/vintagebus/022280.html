Subject: Litchfield show
Mime-Version: 1.0

Always seems alittle strange that the north east events never get mentioned
here....Litchfield was a wonderful show, perfect place, beautiful day, till
the ride home.   A split windshield bus that I believe was a vendor's bus
was in a very bad accident near the show.  Does anyone know if the folks
were OK? Somebody out there must have some information.   thanks, Jim
