Subject: Seal for rear brake line to reduction box brackets?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone have a photo of what these look like?
Some kind of seal that goes on the little brackets attached to the spring 
plate bolt to hold the metal brake line in place.
Anyone know what bolt that piece should be attached to? Top? Bottom? Middle?
I need these seals!
Greg
