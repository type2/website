Subject: Re: [VB]ooops Clutch Pedal

never mind, I was thinking of the forward spring at the brake pedal.

But if you are bored one afternoon, you might take the pedal assemblys out 
and regrease them, they can get pretty crusty and cause problems.  Grease is 
your buses friend.   The older buses have grease fittings  there at the 
pedals, why did they stop doing that?
