Just in case I need the following parts, does anyone have these?

Good set of stock heads (new or used accepted as long as they are GOOD)

Set of stock P/C's for a 1600DP engine.

Thanks for letting me know.  I fear the worst on this engine of mine but
man, I'm ready to tear into her and make it run - whatever it takes.  Gotta
keep tackling the problems as they come up.
