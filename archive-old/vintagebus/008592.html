Subject: Trying out some 14&quot; rims.

Well I'm sure you all remember way back when, when I wanted to go with 15&quot;
tires because they looked more vintage and filled the wheel well up nicer.
The only draw back to using them as I later found out was that running a
freeway flyer and tall tires makes for one helluva tall gear ratio.

Today when I went out to fire up the scooter to go to work, I rooted through
my tire pile in the shed (consists of all wide 5 rims) and all I found were
old bug rims, all narrow, and a couple with their original B.F. Goodrich
tires on them.  Well shoot I thought.  I looked out around beside the shed
and there were a couple of tires that came originally on the 1967 bus.  The
rims look pretty bad - layers of paint chipped here and there and half the
clips missing but both tires still held air and look pretty decent.  I
looked over at the 66 still sitting on the back porch and the front tires
still have their air.  Well here the answer to my problem had lay right in
front of me all along.  I've got 4 tires good enough to drive around on (All
of them are p205's) but the rims just look like utter crap.  I can put these
tires on, drive around, and see how it affects my cruising and my overall
gear ratio.  I think I have the other tire and rim laying around here
someplace because I use to cruise around with the 14&quot; spare bolted to my
front bumper.

So when the weather turns off nice on a weekend, I'll get all the tires all
swapped around and drive on these crappy rims with halfway decent tires on
them and see how they work.  If all goes well, I'll try Terry Wolfe's method
of bolting hubcap clips on instead of riveting them on and then off to the
powder coaters.
