Subject: New WCM &quot;Felts&quot;???

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


i just ordered some WCM &quot;felt channels&quot; for the front door 
windows, and they are drastically different than the ones i've got in the 
past. first of all, it came as one solid roll that you have to cut yourself, 
rather than the 6 pieces listed in the catalog. not a real big deal to 
me.

the strange thing is that there is NO FELT on the rubber!! 
yes, there is a very thin layer of some kind of material on the rubber, but 
that's what the old ones look like after 40 years!

i called WCM, and a guy supposedly went to the warehouse 
to look, and said they were indeed &quot;fuzzy&quot; textured. i called the shop i ordered 
them from, and they said the other sets they had in stock were NOT 
&quot;fuzzy&quot;.

has anyone else received the non &quot;fuzzy&quot; type from WCM? i 
want to (and am going to, regardless) return them, but if i keep getting the non 
&quot;fuzzy&quot; type, why bother? i'll have more i shipping than they cost!

anyone purchased them from Wolfsburg West lately? are they 
&quot;fuzzy&quot;?

jon
