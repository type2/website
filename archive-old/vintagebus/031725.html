  Today 2 things have happened. I just got off the phone with the person
doing the sheet metal stamping here in the U S.  He received a NOS complete
front floor, late 59 to 65, but as we all know will work on later also.
He will have it scanned and ready to go to die making by Wednesday of next
week and should have the first stamping within 2 weeks, ready to unveil at
the CLASSIC&gt; This will be the complete front floor section with the proper
cut outs and the correct front lip, about as close as you can get to an NOS
front floor. I am sending off the rockers and inner pieces on Tuesday to
have copied also, followed by DOGLEGS. These will be made in pieces,
example; early and late outer skins with the top and molding groove in them,
with the inner structure available as an extra piece!  We are still looking
for NOS rear corner piece to copy, will either purchase outright  or
rent/borrow to scan, we would like to go from the beltline down, seam to
seam. We also discussed cargo doors and they will picking those up here to
ship back CLASSIC weekend, on these we discussed making just the lower half
and all the inner structure to go with these and the possibility of doing
the whole outer skin. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope it all works
out, finally some quality local sheet metal.

  On a second note, I am in the process of installing 1.25 ratio rockers on
my DD panel, hope to gain a little more power to pull the 3.88/77 fourth
gear, will use this Yuma trip as the test run, wish me luck.

Have a good weekend.
