&gt;One more question....is there anywhere on the bus besides the tag that
&gt;is on the fresh air thing above the drivers seat where I can find the
&gt;VIN number. I thought there was supposed to be a tag in the engine
&gt;compartment to the right of the engine and below where the gas tank is.
&gt;Atleast thats where it is on my 62 Kombi.  There are no holes that
&gt;would mean one was even there.


On the right side of the engine bay where the angled edge of the apron goes
towards the engine. Stamped in the sheetmetal in half inch letters right in
front of the edge of the apron.
