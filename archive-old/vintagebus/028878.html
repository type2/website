It sounds like the seal is still leaking. The leak you see on the inside
of the backing plate is probably where the GL is running out the drain
hole that drains any GL that gets past the seal. This keeps it from
getting on your brakes, at least for a little while. The way to get the
seal off the race is to destroy it. Just pry the whole 4 bolt deal right
off the axle. Don't be careful with the seal, you're going to replace it
anyway. The race sometimes needs some heat to expand it a little bit so
it will slide off.

Have fun. 8^)

John
