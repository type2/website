To the list,
Porsche 356s are not rare and very few that need significant work can be sold
for what it cost to restore them (Kinda like busses). Just like a bus,
consider one only if you want to fix up and DRIVE IT. I have a friend who has
over $10,000 in his 356, and it is still at the paint shop. The engine is in
parts in his garage and the seats need recovering and the rest of the interior
is trash. It will be a fair weather driver not a concours car when done. The
only reason he is doing it is that he bought the car in Europe when he was in
his early 20's and has many pleasant memories over the last 30 years that he
has owned it.
