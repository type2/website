&lt;&lt; Is there a difference between a 1600 engine out of a bug and the engine out
 of a bus?  The exhaust is obvious but other than that I a curious what else
 may be different. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Well there are a lot of little differances, but for the most part not worth
talking about mechanically.  Like the late bug has the alternator instead of
the earlier generator.  The main differances are the muffler, the intake
cleaner, and the proper jets in the carburator.  The post-1967 bug and bus
use the same carburator jets.  The pre-1968 bus, bug, and K. Ghia using the
same size engines use differant jets from each other and are completely
differant from the later VWs.  This is due to how different the pre-1968 VWs
are able to suck air into thier engine compartments and aircleaners.
