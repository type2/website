Deluxes do seem to be the E ticket these days, but look out, I predict Westfalias will hold a very close second in the very close future.  Of course I think that, I've sunk everything I own into the '59 Westfalia.

Remember RVB's '67 Westy, the RFH = resto from hell.  Well, I've named the '59 Westy the FKR = Fort Knox Resto.  Need I say more?

Correct and thorough restorations are anything but cheap, especially on the Left Coast.  Obviously there's a whole discussion on original vs. restored.  I personally enjoy both types of buses.  I think I would prefer original, but nice original buses are becoming harder and harder to find, and when you do.....$$$$.  Still cheaper than restoring, and I can say that from experience.
