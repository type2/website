Subject: NEATO Raffle motor

I don't know if all of you know, but NEATO is raffling
a complete turnkey 1600 singleport motor and we're
going to pull the ticket at the June OCTO meet before
the classic.  There will be a MAXIMUM of 300 tickets
sold at ten bucks a ticket.  So far the odds are
pretty good, and we have to sell more tickets.

This engine will be delivered to the winner, so anyone
from the middle part of the country or back east won't
have to worry about transportation.

Send your info and $10 (checks to be made out to
NEATO) to me at the address below and I'll return your
ticket.  This is a lot better deal than $.50 a ticket
at a large show.  Please support NEATO and win
yourself an engine!
