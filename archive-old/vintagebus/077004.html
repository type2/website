Subject: Help needed: unusual pushrod &amp; implications

Hi. 1600 SP, stock, but unknown builder. Doing the
usual torque lower bolts and valve adjust, but when I
looked at the pushrods, they have weird ends on them.
I cannot remember seeing any like this. Is this
indicative of maybe a hydraulic cam/lifter set up?
Yes, I looked down the pushrod tubes and did not see
any tell-tale signs of hydraulics like circlips in the
lifters. Yes, I tried pressing very hard on the
pushrods to try to get some kind of movement out of
the lifters (if it were hydraulic) and there was none,
at least none that I could feel. They have no knurled
lines on the one end like stock. Maybe they are just
&quot;high performance&quot; pushrods? They do seem a tad bit
larger in diameter than stock pushrods. Nothing else
on the engine appears to be &quot;high performance&quot;.
I am just wondering if anyone else has seen these, and
how they were used if so (like &quot;yes, hyrdaulic only,
or just &quot;high performance&quot;, whatever).
Here's a link to the pic of the end of one of them:

If it is for hydraulics, I don't want to booger up the
valve adjustment. If not hydraulic, it's no big deal.
I need to get this all back together today, so any
help appreciated. Thanks.
