Subject: Came with the bus..67 owners book

Hey real Bus people   Mine came with my bus and a copy
for the idiot....I mean a copy of the idiot book from
the 70's.The owners book for my 67 looks as if it did
the dog paddle from Germany.First 6 pages and the
cover are missing and the rest are faded but I can
sort of make them out.I like the copy from Thom's site
better....Now back to the show!

=====
Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
