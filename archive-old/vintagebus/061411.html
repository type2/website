Subject: Re: [VB] door locks don't work

In my experience with these locks and handles,
sometimes the diameter of the pin on the back of the
handle is worn and won't quite lock the mechanism.  I
would try enlarging the pin with a close fitting tube
and see if that helps.

JP 

&gt; The mechanism seems to work smoothly when all
&gt; disassembled.  And, if 
&gt; I reinstall the outside door handle very loosely
&gt; (don't tighten the 
&gt; allen-head bolts very tight, so the handle is
&gt; literally loose with a 
&gt; gap between it and the car), it will lock!
