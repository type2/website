Subject: Re: [VB] Weekend salvage yard experience

Gary,
  Not as sad as seeing a splitty in a busy self serve salvage yard knowing that 
it will be crushed in a month or less! We've saved a couple of splitties before 
they hit the yard and rescued a lot of good parts off the unfortunate. 

 -Harry
&gt;  Is just me or is
&gt; it just sad to see all those Buses just wasting away out in the yard.
