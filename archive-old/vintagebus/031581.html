Subject: Re: [VB] To Cut or Not to Cut???

Thats right. . . it was you Scott. No more problems?? Did you do anything
about the torque issue besides welding first and second? Or did you even weld
em?

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Type 4 is the way to go for more power and retain reliability. Search
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When this type 4 engine discussion first came up, I emailed the grand
&gt; &gt; guru Bob Hoover to find out what he thought. One dooood on the list had
&gt; &gt; already done the conversion and had glowing revues that it was the best
&gt; &gt; thing since sliced bread. And it sounded so nice, all that power and
&gt; &gt; reliability. But then Bob Hoover threw his big ole monkey wrench into
&gt; &gt; the gears. He said that due to the increased torque that the
&gt; &gt; transmission would not hold up unless modifications where made to it.
&gt; &gt; Low and behold, a few weeks later the same dooood posted that his
&gt; &gt; transmission now had a crack in it. So Bob was right again.
&gt;
&gt; Well.... since you be pointing the finger at this dooood, let me tell the
&gt; whole story but in short form.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I plunked down $300 deposit to a now defuct listee for a BUILT up trans
&gt; that never showed up, nor did my money ever materialize.
&gt; (http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/toddhill.html )
&gt; 2. City threatened with removal of my DC
&gt; 3. I threw in a condition unknown, stock 74 thing transaxle and drove it
&gt; with the 2L type IV.
&gt; 4. I got one year on the trans (not a few weeks) before 1st gear broke.
&gt; 5. Having the city off my back, I pulled the trans and sent it down to
&gt; Rancho Performance for the proper rebuild/buildup as originally planned.
&gt; (details easily found in the archives)
&gt; 6. 12K miles later, I'm still glowing and eating sliced bread every day.
&gt; :-))
&gt;
&gt; gotta go jump into the DC and blast off to school.
&gt;
&gt; Scott
