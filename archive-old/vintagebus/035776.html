It's not very tricky to rebuild a Solex 30-pict.   

you need some carb cleaner, a wiped out oil drain bucket, some thick rubber 
gloves, an rebuild kit and some screwdrivers.  Also there is the question of 
jetting-I find that motorcycle shops have main jets, and they cost about a 
quarter.  Okay, the dont SAY solex, but no one will point and laugh.  Ask the 
list for the carb jettings (Veewee111?)

I take the carb off and put it in the oil drain pan.  I keep all the bits in 
there so I dont drop them.  The rebuild kits come with assembly instructions, 
which are for several models, but pictures help.  The main thing is when you 
are done there are no pieces left over, and as each piece only fits one place 
you are okay.    Even the screws for each part are diff- the screws holding 
the top on are one kind- the ones for the choke another, etc.  You unscrew 
all the bits from each other.   The little brass things with holes in are 
jets- they have a number stamped in like 130 or 125 or 127.5.  the long thin 
one with holes like a reed pipe that pokes staright down into the lower half 
of the carb is the aircorrection jet- it has a  number too.  You basically 
have that and the main jet in terms of jets- the main jet is accessaable from 
the left of the carb.   when everthing is apart you put the rubber gloves on 
and  spray carb cleaner through all the little holes (passages in the carb)   
it will come out in unexpected places.   It's nice to let them soak overnight 
if you have a friend with a solvent tank.  clean the scuz out of the bowl, if 
there is some.    


I had to do this on my bug a few montths ago- I had bought the carb new about 
8 years and many K miles before, and it just had deposits.

but- maybe your timing is off or you carb needs adjustment?   It probably 
isn;t clogged if it runs great at altitude, it might have the timing off.

er- what exactly does it do at sea level that it didn't in Alburquerque?   
Splutter?  hesitate?  stall at idle?  feel unsmooth?

also- does it do it after you have driven 20 minutes?  On sunny afternoons?   
if it clears up after the truck is warmed up, it may be a carb icing problem 
which occurs when it is cool and damp (in the morning on the coast?)   and I 
wonder if you have a pre heat tube?
