Subject: RE: Ebay stuff...OK we can read Ebay ourselves
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    If I remember correctly if you make a post about something on Ebay, the 
agreement is that you have to say that in the subject line. That way the 
listees who don't care for that sort of thing can delete it.    
    I think that some of the stuff people post about is neat. The speaker 
bus, the bus with the 707 cockpit, strange parts, things like that. A lot of 
stuff on Ebay is crap, but I appreciate when someone points out something 
that is cool.
