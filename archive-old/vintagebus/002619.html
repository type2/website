Subject: Re: Drakula's rear end

&gt;all i DO know--is that this is the rear Bumper that came with
&gt;Drakula when he left the Frickinger coachworks--BUT it does NOT mean it
&gt;is the bumper that left the VW plant!!! The VW German bus friend that i
&gt;purchased Drakula from has given me the complete history of Drakula--all
&gt;that can be said about Drakhla's rear end is &quot;That's the way it came&quot;!!


An interesting thing, and one pointed out by Barb and Eric, is that the
truck and bus bumpers had the same part number. This is true, it is an
identical number. However, they are not identical, and even though grinding
them to fit has been done, there is more difference than just the inside
radius. The whole corner is more square on a truck bumper. On the ribbed
that I saw the bumper bends in about a 2 or 3 inch inside radius at the
corners. On the buses it's closer to a 6 inch radius. Same thing on the
slash i saw, the curve radius is tighter. I think the bus bumper has a
gentle arc from end to end also, although this may be due more to age and
abuse than design. The truck bumpers I've seen are dead straight from end to
end. If the bumper for Drakula were ordered seperately from the factory, I
don't know how they would have distinguished it's truck or bus use. With the
information I've seen, there is no designation for the difference.
