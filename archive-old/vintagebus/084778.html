&gt;I just recently installed a 205M distributor on my '67.

Like Jason said, compare the full part number to the listings at
oldvolkshome_dot_com .

&gt;I have the vacuum line connected to the port just above the fuel
&gt;shut-off solenoid.

Can you figure out where the other end of this port is, inside the
carburetor?  (If it doesn't have a check valve, you might be able to blow
into the port through a length of tube and figure out where the air
comes out, or squirt WD-40 or carb cleaner into it and see where it
drips out, etc.)  If it comes out well below the throttle plate, it's
essentially manifold vacuum.  Some ports come out right above the
throttle plate, so that there's no vacuum (no advance) until the
throttle opens a little bit.  If you have a vacuum gauge, you can hook
that to the various ports on your carb and see how each one behaves.
Make sure any ports you aren't using are capped off with snug-fitting
rubber or vinyl caps.  I have mixed feelings about the sealing
properties of sticking a sheetmetal screw into a short length of tubing.

&gt;Points are gapped at .016,

Again, I agree with Jason... buy, beg, borrow, or steal a meter and check
the actual dwell angle.  Setting the points at 0.016&quot; comes from a time
when everybody had feeler gauges and nobody had a dwell meter.

FWIW, I have adjusted the points on two VWs (my '64 Bus-1500 SP-009,
Dad's '74 Bug-1600 DP-stock dizzy) often enough to see this pattern:
the setting the makes the dwell come out right is usually quite a bit
less than 0.016&quot;; it's generally around 0.014&quot; and sometimes as little
as 0.012&quot;.  Your mileage may vary.

&gt;timing is at 32 degrees at full advance and TDC _at_ 800rpm with the vacuum
&gt;line unplugged at the dizzy.

Since it sounds like you have a way to measure the timing while running,
if you also have a hand vacuum pump, you can apply different amounts of
vacuum to the distributor and see if it is within spec.
