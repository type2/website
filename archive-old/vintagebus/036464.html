Subject: WTB: nice ribbed rear truck bumper
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey all,
I'm looking for a good used ribbed rear truck bumper for my good friends 
newly acquired '55 single cab... Anyone have one for sale?
Also, what color lens semaphore is correct on this? orange non-ribbed i 
assume?

Thanks,
Pete
