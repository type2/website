Subject: [VB] bad luck message from last Thur

Rex,

The best way to touch up the paint is with an airbrush and preferably, a

double action one. This just means that there are controls for the paint

and for the air. But if I didn't have one, this is how I might do it.

I would prep the surface. I know you know how to do that!!!

Then I would cut a paper mask just slightly larger than the scratch out
of fairly stiff paper. I would shoot my primer through this hole,
holding it about an inch from the scrath. A spray bomb should work.

After some very careful wet sanding, I would then cut a new mask slighly

larger than the last. I would repeat the previous steps using white. By
doing it this way, you will eliminate a lot of overspray, and you can
really control just where the paint is going.

You should be able to make the repair and nobody will know the diff.

Les
