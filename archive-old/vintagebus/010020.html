Ronnie set me up with kits w/seals and a DIFFERENT seal that he said was the
proper one,he said save the seal from the kit for a bug.I have had no
problems with them on the 59(2500 miles) with a small nut gearbox.The seal I
used looked wider than the seals in the kit.

&gt; I'm having a chronic leakage problem - does that mean I'm not seated?
&gt;
&gt; Is there something fundamentally different with the Mexian seals available
&gt; now?  I've done axle seals many times over my VW life, both mine and
others,
&gt; and it's only recently that I've had issues.  With the '55 it took 3 tries
&gt; on one side to get the seal to not leak. On the 60 I just replaced the
seal
&gt; for the 4th time yesterday afternoon.

&gt; &gt; Not really.  If you have no leakage to speak of the bearing must have
seated.
