Subject: Bus Chicks and Bob
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To Brian and the List:

I've been lusting after bus chicks myself for the last couple of years, and guess what? I finally caught one!

Ok, so I'm a splitty kinda guy, and she's the cushy late model (74) kinda chick (the bus is cushy, Kim's pretty sleek), but actually, taking her bus on a camping trip is pretty nice. 

Like you, Brian, I've done what I could to get the attention of the girls on the list (Kim thought that was pretty silly), but I would suggest to you to go to the camp-ins and shows, bat your eyes a few times at one, and see what happens! Kim would suggest a more subtle approach. Whatever works for you...

BTW, Kim won't admit that she's insane, but I think she is for being with a nut like me.

As for Bob, I have the utmost respect for him. He's helped me out a couple of times on things that I SHOULD have found elsewhere, after a reminder that I COULD have found them elsewhere. After all, Bob didn't accumulate all of his knowledge sitting in front of a computer asking dumb questions; he's a busy man.
