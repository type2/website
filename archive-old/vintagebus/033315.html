&lt;&lt; Anyone have a photo of what these look like?
 Some kind of seal that goes on the little brackets attached to the spring 
 plate bolt to hold the metal brake line in place.
 Anyone know what bolt that piece should be attached to? Top? Bottom? Middle?
 I need these seals!

I use a piece of old fuel line to grommet it, dunno about repro bits, they 
look like the ones that are around the metal line from from to back where it 
goes through metal.  They are slit  so really a C rather than a circle, so 
you can slip them over the brake line w/o opening the line.   Bottom bolt, I 
believe.  early buses use those flat double washer things. one bent to hold 
the brake line.
