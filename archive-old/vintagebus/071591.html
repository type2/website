Subject: Re: [VB] 60 single cab wheels Q

50 singlecab? That doesnt exist (according to the factory).
If you meant &quot;50's&quot; single cab, then it would have 16's if it was pre march 55. And 15's if it was
later 50's.
some post mar55's also have been seen og with 16's . 16's do have a &quot;smoothie&quot; appearance to them
unlike the 15's, but its the rim width that makes it a bus 16 as opposed to a bug 16.

 guessing 15 inches.
