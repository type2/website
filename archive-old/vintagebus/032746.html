Digging a little deeper in the garage in preparation for the move and I found 
a few more things:

Brake light engine lid.  Very good, but not perfect, condition.

2 pair - Head light buckets complete with trim ring, glass, and head light.  
I have a pair of both screw terminal and spade terminal.  Screw terminal set 
has the VW logo on the glass cover.  All pieces on both sets are in excellent 
condition.

Complete set of deluxe belt line trim

Deluxe front bumper with trim, overrider bar, and bumper guard. Point style.

NOS front bumper blade.  Point style
