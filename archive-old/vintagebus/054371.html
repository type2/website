Subject: Camshaft selection?

... Another tried and failed aftermarket part.

Well after running a mild CB Performance grind camshaft... I am going back
to stock!  For my needs I think the stock cam will be perfect for better low
end torque (I never see past 4000 RPM anyway and the CB cam lives above 3500
RPM which gives me little use).

I am guessing I will have to order a new Brazilian cam..?  Are German
regrinds alright or better?  What would the cost difference be?

Also what is the best timing offset?  They seem to come in +2, +1, 0, -1,
and -2 formats.  I am thinking that 0 is the best choice  or would something
more aggressive be better like +2?

Is there a grinder that makes a decent &quot;torque/bus&quot; grind cam?  I used to
see a few advertised, but never heard a personal testimony about it.

I have a 3 bolt flat cam oil pump currently so dished cams are not an
option.

Sorry for the simplistic questions, but I am pretty naive when it comes to
camshaft grinds and timing.  They are easy to replace and put in, but hard
to pick :)

* On side note take the time in the next few weeks to go camping.  We went
this weekend in the north Georgia mountains and it was wonderful.  The
trails are beautiful this time of year and it is not too cold yet.  My wife
claims it was one of the best campouts yet (she still likes the Hanging Dog
event in Murphy NC the best though) * 

TIA,
