&lt;&lt; So what are the possible causes of this. Is it normal wear and tear?  Or 
is this a symptom of another problem? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
Yes!  The problem with wanting a clear cut reason for this, is way over two 
dozen reasons we can think of!  The only way to tell if there is a cause is 
to thoughly clean, inspect and measure everything!  Eric&amp;Barb
