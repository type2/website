You might try Sound Starter Rebuild, in Ruston [on Pearl St., near Pt.
Defiance park].  This is a small shop with only 3 or 4 people, and they do
lots of custom work.

They've been doing rebuilds/repairs on all sorts of peculiar and obscure
automotive and marine stuff for many years.  Their quality is excellent and
their prices are reasonable.
