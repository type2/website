Subject: Apron Questions

Hi , A few questions. I searched the Archive, but couldn't quite get the
info that I wanted...
Is the crank apron on my 2/59 correct? (it sure looks like it)
Should a 65' apron work?
If so, it doesn't. I can't seem to latch the engine lid. Can I shim it from
behind or something?
Is the cut-away for the tailpipe the same shape on the two aprons?
    In case anyone is wondering, I want to use my spare 65' until  I can get
my 59' welded. Someone welded the ident on the left, and made a new one on
the right!
TIA !
