Eric,   
Where are you reading this number from?  It sounds to me that your looking at 
the casting numbers instead of the serial number.  I'm wondering since it 
starts out with AS41 which was a type of case material, and because of all 
the ones and zeroes.  If you read the numbers from the side of the case, 
underneath where the pushrod tubes go in, you're in the wrong place.    

If this number is from under where the generator stand is mounted, the info 
Jack gave would be correct. 

Just making sure,
