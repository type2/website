I was planning on autocrossing my 911 this weekend, but on Thursday the
alternator went out (I have all the receipts for the car, and there isn't
an alternator in them, so it could have been OG - with 200k+ miles) Not
wanting to miss out, I decided to take the bus along as a support vehicle,
and use it to charge the 911 battery between sessions.  It worked.  I
hooked up jumper cables and ran the bus at a high idle, and I could
hear the change in the engine when I made the last connection.  It also helped
that I had Optima batteries in both cars, and if I had to, I could have just
switched batteries.

It was also nice having the westy tent - there is only one tiny little &quot;grandstand&quot; with shade
out there.  It was also fun to have people with 50k-100k into their various Porsches go
gaga over my simple bus!
