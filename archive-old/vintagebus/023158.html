Subject: '54 home, need some parts...
Mime-Version: 1.0

	
I rented a truck and trailer today and pulled the '54 home.  Ah, something
to do this winter!

I spent some time looking over the bus, trying to re-aquaint myself.
There's a few things I still need:

* nose clip 
* doglegs - 3-piece doglegs would be GREAT, but willing to compromise.
* rear corners - barndoor corners would be GREAT, but willing to compromise.  

I need good, clean, dry (rust free) pieces.  Have cash on hand.
