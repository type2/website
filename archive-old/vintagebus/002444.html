Hey Pete,
    I had to trim mine on the outer forward edges to get them to fit.
I ran into the same problem,where they then got stuck and
wouldn't go in any more.Then they were stuck so I had a hard
time getting them out without fudging them up.So go slow.

&gt; Hey guys---
&gt; I've got some cab roof panels from WW just about in my '59.  they need to
go
&gt; just an inch further on the middle corners and will be ready for screws,
but,
&gt; they aren't budging a bit??? I've worked for an hour to no avail?? any
tips??
&gt;
&gt; BTW---I've asked before, but, what size and type of fastener do cab
dividers
&gt; use???
&gt; I need to get some to mount it up this weekend!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks--Pete
&gt; '59 panel
