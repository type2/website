Subject: Gearshift advice

All,

Some advice on your gearshift.  If it's working, don't take it apart.
If you take it apart, here's how to put it back together:

1.  Clean off old grease.
2.  Get grease gun, squirt grease all over your hands and the front
    seat of the Bus.  That's where it'll end up anyway.
3.  Grab the gearshift near the bend with the first hand.
4.  Compress the cone spring with the second hand.
5.  Push the spring-loaded pin in the ball in with the third hand.
6.  Hold the reverse lockout plate steady with the fourth hand.
7.  Under the Bus, the fifth hand should be holding up the shift
    rod bracket.  A sixth hand may be useful to hold the shift rod
    in the right place. 
8.  &quot;Installation is the reverse of removal.&quot;  If there's only one
    person it takes a couple of hours.  If there's two people the
    time can be reduce to 1:59:30.
