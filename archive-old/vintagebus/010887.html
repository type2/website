The 63 I am driving daily in Oly WA is a good runner. I havent timed it,
tuned, or messed with it at all for two years except fixing the horn. Many
thanks to Clara for letting me play with her horn stash. (LOL) Aside from
how that sounds (pun, pun) Fixing a horn that has screws isnt that hard.
File the points.

Anyway.....

My 63 gets from here to there and looks ugly and is even worse inside.
Something has died in there. Literally. Smells terrible.

The point is that there are nice busses here. The panel van yellow on white
is awesome. Dual cargo doors, right and left, decent paint, no observable
rust or dimples, just nice.

Just had to say that for no good reason.
Dont post often enough I guess.

Jason
