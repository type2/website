Subject: Trade?: My 63 OG Workshop Manual vol2 for your Bentley 63-67?

Hi,

Before I put this up on eBay, anyone out there want a 63 vol2 of the 
Workshop Manual?

This covers electrical and body, including deluxe, kombi, pick-up and 
ambulance. No special vehicle inserts. Very nice - excellent condition 
(very little yellowing, no rips, no folds, no writing, photos are 
blue-tinted). The cover is in +excellent shape. The only negative is the 
first cover divider has slight mildew and is warped (but could be 
straightened out).

I'd like to trade for a Bentley repro 63-67 workshop manual. Your manual 
can be dirty, I don't care, as long as I can read the text and the 
pictures aren't all smudgy.

The problem with an original is that I don't want to get it dirty! And I 
also need to complete my front end (this year) which this doesn't cover.

Thanks,
Conrad
