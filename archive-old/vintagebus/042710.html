&gt; So with these new findings can someone shed new light on it for me? Any
&gt; one know of a good photo of a Drag link so I can compare mine?

If the draglink is rubbing on the floor it is bent, no need to compare.

being bent weakens the metal, you cant bend it back (well you can, but it
may weaken to the point it'll give way unexpectedly no way to know when
and how it'll give)

A new draglink is cheaper and less painful than the surgery neccecary
after the damaged one breaks and you go careening out of control into ?

Put in a new one ($30 or so) recenter it and rest easy. (if you must
verify yours is bent, compare it to the new one you just bought.)

While you are there make sure your tierods are straight, ends tight.  You
_should_ also check to see if your trailing arms are bent, but this is a
pain that involves diassembling your linkpins. I've never done it so i
cant comment directly. 

take care,

Steve
