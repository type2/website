Subject: [VB] Re: Disc Brakes on Front??

&gt;That's why VW service-replaced splitty brakes with 944 discs starting in 
&gt;1955.&lt;

In 1971 they put discs on it.  Call it evolution.

Back in the 60s only all out performance cars had discs.

Anyways, I like the disc brake system and it works very well for me.  YMMV.

Later,
Adrian
