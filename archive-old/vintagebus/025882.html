I made it back to Phoenix, AZ at 8 p.m. last night.  My '55 Barndoor Kombi
and I traveled exactly 1000 miles over the 4 day period from a 4:30 a.m.
start to meet the London Bridge Bullis mid-desert at Chiriaco Summit to
Christmas Tree Island to the NEATO/OCTO meet to the listee get-together to
Irvine Lake to the Classic to Charlie's house to a late night cruise through
the bad and good of LA to Greg's crib and back across the 110F desert home
to Phoenix.

My Bus ran great the whole time with the exception of blowing the regulator
on the way home.  I stared at the gen. light for the last 250 miles rather
than stop in the 110F desert and perform a swap, round regulators are a
bitch.  On the 10-hour return trip, the Kombi oil ran 197F through LA for
the first ~100 miles and about 227F up the hills in the desert at 30-40 mph,
mostly in 4th gear.

Highlights of the trip:
o Bus caravan to the OCTO show - at least 40 Buses?  I was in the middle and
I could not see the beginning or ending for most of the 1 hr. drive.
o &gt;30 Barndoors at the OCTO meet, insane!
o I was offered a Barndoor decklid in the listee mtg. parking lot, it pays
to meet your listee brethren.  Price could could not be agreed on but I
turned it around and sold him a crank tin breast plate.
o Irvine Lake - nice view, VW Howard won big.  ;)
o The Classic - HUGE, they still need to get their act together on the line
to get in, the swaps were big but most stuff was ridiculous, that's normal I
guess.  It looked like everyone took most of their stuff home with them.  I
walked around at the end and picked up a few cheap Barndoor parts but I only
dropped $200, how sad for me.  ;(
o Charlie's House - Saw the low-mileage '52 Deluxe for the first time, sweet
Bus.  I say drive it to the show next year.
o Greg/Frankie/Calvin's crib - His '57 is coming along nicely, I was nice
and didn't make him shove it over to park my Barndoor inside, heh-heh.  I
think he had all his parts hidden away, I know you have some serious
hoarding going on there...

Memorable quote of the trip came from a guy who, when asked if he wanted to
ride in another car instead of squeezing in between all the crap in my cargo
area, said:
&quot;I only ride in Barndoors.&quot;

I met A LOT of people, thanks go out to all for the web site compliments.  A
few people got blown off, please try again whenever you see me, it was not
intentional.
