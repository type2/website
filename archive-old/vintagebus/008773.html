Im trying to get the housing and the generator back together (so its more
generator related; sorry).  Im looking at the generator, the cover plates,
the infamous woodruf key, and the squirrel cage.  Im looking exploded
pictures in catalogs as well (the $%#^ documentation Ive got in these books
are vague at best)
