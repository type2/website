Hi Jeff,
The best thing for suspension parts is to degrease them and find a reasonable
powder coating place in your area.  They should have the sand and/or bead
blasting capabilities and have them high zinc primer and then semigloss black
podwer coat your parts.  Powder coating is chip proof and scratch resistant.
Our powder coating place coats zinc plated electrical conduit and then as a
demo will hammer one of these short sections flat with no signs of the powder
coating chipping or flaking.  We are having our suspension coated this way and
a year and 25,000 miles later it is holding up perfectly.  Our powder coater
does the sanding, zinc primer, and semigloss black coating for $10.00 each
brake backing plate.    Eric &amp; Barb
