Hi All,

I'm still considering the Okrasa setup in my double cab.... the thought by
Thom of the Porche is tempting but....

Anyway, due to time constraints, I don't want to tackle the building of such
at this time and I want to do a few shows this summer in the PNW.  I have
found two builders and would appreciate any feedback from listees that might
have a comment.   Joe Ruiz is one and Richard Troy is the other.  (I either
one of you are subscribers.... I'm just checking...)  Anybody know these
people????


Thanks
David
