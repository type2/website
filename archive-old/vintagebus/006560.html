Hello Everyone...

Methinks it is appropriate now to order the plethora of rubber for windows,
doors, latches, hatches, and lights...etc.  I need it all!   I am two days
or less of work before spraying the lower part of the '66 Westy that has
occupied me for this last summer and fall.  I have successfully completed
the top half and roof, and upon the imminent colorization of the rest, I
re-assemble.

My question (although redundant, sorry) is as follows:

Who is the best supplier for ordering all these parts (price is less
important than the quality factor).  I would like to get everything from one
place to save time and minimize error.  Your experiences and opinions are of
great value to me.

Thanks a whole hell of a lot!

Later,

Gene
