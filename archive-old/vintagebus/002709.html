Here's my trip report. Walked down the street about a block, gave the PO
a fist full of $20's and pushed the '65 blue/green-velvet green 21
window Deluxe to my house. It got really good mileage, and emissions
were super low.

Anyway, the Deluxe is finally in captivity, the loaf westy fiberglass
top has been removed and the restoration starts. Who's got mesh grey
deluxe interior panels?

Thanks to Karl and Todd for their evaluations and suggestions.

      -HH in Fresno, CA (not sure if we're 'stat'ed in NorCA or SoCA)
