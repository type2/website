Subject: Re: [VB] (friday) the truth about our VW's

&gt;When I attempted to look at the new VW's at the local dealer I was
&gt;asked  &quot;Do you REALLY think you can afford a VW&quot; (in a very condescending
&gt;tone). Then the salesman refused to unlock any of the cars. That and he
&gt;commented on the &quot;Crappy&quot; appearance of my &quot;61 Singlecab...he didn't
&gt;believe that someone would hack up a bus to make a pick-up. Needless to say
&gt;I will never give that dealership any business or referrals.


I hope you took a moment to tell the guy what a moron he was.  He was
probably selling Yugos a few years back, and Fiats before that.
