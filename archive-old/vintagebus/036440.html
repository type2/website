Sunroof (And dormobile?) and double door busses came with &quot;belly pans&quot; for 
extra structural integrity. Just like little skid plates welded to the bottom.
You no longer have a view of the frame in the center of the bus.

&lt;&lt; I learned a new thing while reading the posts about the slide out step:  I

don't know what a subfloor or belly pan on a bus is.  Regular, I've

got....did they lower the floor in some buses?  As far as belly pan

goes....my imaginings look like the regular cargo floor, with insulation

underneath, and then a panel to protect the insulation.  I think that sounds

like a good idea..


Please relieve me of my ignorance!


Thanks, Gene &gt;&gt;
