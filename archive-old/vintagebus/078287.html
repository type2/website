Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

E n'B,

I'm starting to think there could be a bad main bearing on the input shaft
of the tranny. How would I check that without disassembly? I guess I'd
have to start the engine outside of the bus. Anyone want to hold the
starter motor against the engine for me?

&gt; best step next is to remove engine and setup so you can start it outside of
&gt; your VW.  If the noise goes away it is not the engine then.
