Subject: Re: [T2] George is broken down in Paradise (Utah), cylinder
  stud

George,
I FOUND a place that is probably 100 miles from you (25 as the crow files)
south in Ogden UT. The guy wants to know exactly which stud it is and he
most likely has one.

Vee Dub Service - 880 West 2100 South, Ogden, UT. 84401 (801) 392-0212

&gt;The bad:
&gt;I don't know how much of the stud remains in the case.  If there isn't
&gt;much poking out it could be a bear to remove.
&gt;I'm in Utah on a Sunday.  Not many parts houses open.
&gt;
&gt;What we need:
&gt;A source for a cylinder stud for a 1600DP Mexican engine.  I think that
&gt;this engine has the small studs.
&gt;Advice on how to get the remaining stud out of the case.
