Holey-moley!!! He wants the elusive car show dee-lucks kit. MX code 1002. I
believe this unit lists for about $1000.00+ at swap meets everywhere. NOS
kits with all of the pieces are becoming extremely rare, but most of the
parts can be had in the $100 to $500 range separately. Should probably get
some louver trim, a functioning windshield squirter bottle, and one of them
crying child dolls to stick on the bumper, too.
