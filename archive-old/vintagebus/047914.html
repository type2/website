&lt;&lt;someone emailed me today looking for some clear skylight glass

I looked and the set I have is green, and it came from 3 seperate buses......

ummmm.....did they ever make clear ones ?
&gt;&gt;

The Laminated glass always tentds to have a green tint to it.
This I believe is form the glue that holds the lamiates together.
Both early and late styles (sekurit) have a blue tint to them.
Different manufacturer, different glass!
I think the 53 and older PLEXIGLASS ones are straight clear......cept they 
crack!
DOGG!
