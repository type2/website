In my humble opinion, supercharging an aircooled engine is just plain
and simple a bad idea. These engines are already operating at the outer
envelope in displacing heat. And then here ya go with a supercharger,
which is just like blowing on a camp fire. I just dont think it can
handle it except for a brief  few seconds, and even then you are just
asking for it. My father had a turbo charged Corvair. It ran like a bat
out of hell. But one day it stopped running. One piston had cracked
around the entire circumference. I can't imagine any other possible
cause except for overheating. I know they do it with Porshe engines, but
then those doooods seem to have the bucks for frequent expensive
repairs.
