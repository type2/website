Both Bob Hoover and George Lyle made some excellent points in their
comments on lubricating the transmission mainshaft splines.  I can add
only a little to their already thorough discussion. 

[Bob]:

&gt;&gt;A TINY amount of grease applied to the splines will prevent the
&gt;&gt;mainshaft and clutch-disk from rusting together.  (You've never really
&gt;&gt;played mechanic until you're asked to separate an engine &amp; tranny that
&gt;&gt;have rusted together :-) 

Most vehicles have much coarser splines on the mainshaft and clutch 
hub.  I suspect that the fineness of the VW splines makes rust a 
greater potential problem.  While a coarse splined shaft might also 
rust, probably that would be less likely to cause things to stick 
together.

[Bob]:

&gt;&gt;The problem here is that grease really isn't the best stuff to use, and
&gt;&gt;most folks use too much of it anyway. 

&gt;&gt;The VW clutch-disk is pretty small to begin with.  It doesn't take much
&gt;&gt;grease to ruin it.  Most of the ones I see have a pattern of greasy
&gt;&gt;radial rays around the hub indicating the thing was installed with a
&gt;&gt;glob of grease... which then flung itself all over. 

I think that too much grease on the flywheel pilot bearing will also 
wind up spattered around the clutch disk.  By all means lube the pilot 
bearing, but a little goes a long way.

[Bob]:

&gt;&gt;in that regard it's best to treat this junction as you would the
&gt;&gt;junction between your rear axles and your brake drums, which is to
&gt;&gt;scrub a high-quality metallic-based anti-sieze compound into the
&gt;&gt;splines in both components, being careful to wipe off any residue 

&gt;&gt;I use that copper-based stuff and an old toothbrush, then I wipe it
&gt;&gt;down hard -- you can't get that copper-stuff out of the splines...
&gt;&gt;which is exactly where you want it. 

[George]:

&gt;&gt;Since I consider my VWs to be &quot;forever cars&quot;, It seems prudent to
&gt;&gt;lubricate the splines sparingly whenever the engine is out.  At the
&gt;&gt;least it will prevent the shaft from sticking to the disk, and there
&gt;&gt;is the possibility that it might reduce mainshaft wear as well.  

&gt;&gt;My choice of distributor point grease is due to its high viscosity. 
&gt;&gt;Anti-sieze would probably work as well, but I'm fearful that this
&gt;&gt;relatively thin grease would get onto the clutch disk.

I have had good success using a moderate amount of &quot;Never-Seez&quot; on VW 
mainshaft splines.  It is available as both a spray and brush-on.  
Never-Seez contains aluminum powder, copper powder, zinc oxide, and 
methylene chloride.

It used to be manufactured by the Bostik Company in Littleton, 
Massachusetts, but I think they made be part of whoever owns Permatex &amp; 
Loctite nowadays.  I don't recall seeing it in auto parts stores, but 
some industrial fastener companies that specialize in nuts &amp; bolts 
carry it.

Aside from using it on mainshaft splines, Never-Seez works extremely
well in preventing frozen nuts and bolts, without affecting torque 
settings.  I use it on the lug nuts of my own personal cars, and on 
exhaust system fasteners on any car.

Never-Seez effectively prevents frozen or broken exhaust studs on VW
engines, and I highly recommend it.  It's not cheap, but pulling 
engines to drill out broken exhaust studs isn't cheap (or fun) either.
