Subject: Re: [VB] Rap on distributors

For 1600 sp with a 24mm venturi Solex or similar carb** I think you want a 113
905 205 M or T, simple single vacuum advance, used on a lot of type 1 engine
baywindow busses. They are all pretty old at this point, check it out well
before plugging it in. 009 maybe isn't the best choice, but for $50 new and
unwornout it is not a bad choice either.
I think carb and dizzy go hand-in-hand, a different set for each different
engine displacement. 30PICT2 and 3 carbs were designed for 1600sp, M and T
(interchangeable, I think?) dizzy completes the set. I have come to consider the
Brosol H30/31 to be the 30PICT4 carb and treat it much like a 30PICT3, that's my
opinion.
** All bets are off if you have a hot cam or webber carb or the like.

I recently got a pile of M and T dizzies from a listee in NY, I am interested in
rebuilding them, seeing how many I can save. Does anyone have any advice for me
on rebuilding these, what parts are still available for them?

Subject: [VB] Rap on distributors


&gt; The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year? Is it
&gt; the case? Is it the number of ports? Is it the crank? What changes on the
&gt; 1600 engine occurred over the years to require a different distributor???
&gt;
&gt; History:
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help at Everybus to everyone that had input on my hot engine
&gt; problem. The ride there was long as I could not go over 50 mph and keep the
&gt; oil temp (VDO dip stick sender) below 250 degrees. I radioed the carabussers
&gt; and told them to pass me, but my buddies from the TN Mechanized and my best
&gt; friend Chris Slaymaker refused to leave me.
&gt;
&gt; One initial comment: If you ask 20 bus owners about oil temp reading, you
&gt; will get 20 different answers. I had one guy nervous about his high
&gt; temperature getting to 190 and one guy with worlds more VW experience than
&gt; me running at 280 and not concerned in the least.  My gut tells me to cool
&gt; off at 240, but I had just put in 20-50 synthetic so I figured I would not
&gt; go past 250 and stay safe.
&gt;
&gt; I had retarded the timing a bit with no help and no power so I advanced the
&gt; timing just before the trip. I had much better power, and stayed at
&gt; comfortable temps in the mountains, but the Interstate driving nearly killed
&gt; me (literally as if that outraged redneck truck driver had had a gun, I
&gt; would have been shot for slowing him down- another story for another day).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, Steve Dolan putzed with the timing at EB and said it was too far
&gt; advanced, and anyway, that was the wrong distributor for that year. He
&gt; retarded it a bit but that did not help and did lead to a loss of power
&gt; coming back of the mountain.
&gt;
&gt; I ask The Big Question because this engine is a bit of a Frankenstein as I
&gt; built it on the case from the 71 DP. The case was stamped &quot;Mexico&quot; so all I
&gt; know is that it was in the bus when I bought it in 1983. It was DP when I
&gt; tore it down, but I put on SP heads. The crank was also from the 71, but I
&gt; have no idea if it was the original one. So when I look at distributor
&gt; charts, what year engine do I have?
&gt;
&gt; Dolan was right. I found out today that this distributor is from a 1972 MT
&gt; Beetle, and as confused as I am, I am sure I do not have one of those. :-)
&gt;
&gt; I have four distributors in front of me and none look close to what I need.
&gt; Dolan and I went butt sniffing (engine lid lifting) at EB, and found all the
&gt; early bays that we looked at were running 009s. I have one of those but a
&gt; friend was messing with it and broke the return spring. We found a spring
&gt; that would fit, but I assume that it is important to put the exactly correct
&gt; one back in for it to advance correctly. How can I get this one fixed?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all for any input.
&gt;
&gt; PS: One good thing happened. Many listened to the engine and thought it
&gt; sounded great. I guess the vibration thing is not as bad a I perceived it to
&gt; be.
