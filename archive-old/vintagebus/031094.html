Subject: OCTO: Bring your Hangovers to my DC

OK all you far flung OCTO attendees.  Due to other commitments, I will most likely
have to miss the pre-OCTO/Classic events.  So, I would like to invite listees to
stop by my Double Cab and nurse their hangovers on a nice hot bowl of homemade
menudo and some corn tortillas..  I'll have a big batch brewing on the camp stove,
so there should be enough to go around.  Unless of course,  the party Friday night
causes more damage than expected. :-))

On that note, don't leave the DDs at home.  They don't need a hangover to have
some menudo either.
