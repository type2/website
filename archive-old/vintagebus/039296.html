Subject: Front Axel Nuts, Lube Job
Date: Mon, 31 Aug 1998 11:58:43 -0700

When was the transition from the Allen head bolt
nut to double nut and a bend over washer made?

I replaced the grease in the front end of my bus this 
weekend, and removed the front wheels to gain access
and to check things out.

I found one missing grease nipple, and one loose.
Over all this job went well.  I didn't just top off the grease, 
I skooshed until new grease came out of the joints.
Not as messy as I thought it would be.

On my '64 (long ago) I remember I had the Allen bolt style
nut on the front axle.  I had an early '64 (pull door handles)
so in keeping with that theme I guess I had the early axle nuts.

The '67 had (on the left), the bendy lock washer and ONE nut.
As I was unbending the washer, it was obvious that the single nut 
could move easily enough to affect the bearing loading.  Not good.

The right was worse.  There was an awful style nut on this side.
Machined as part of the one nut (no bendy washer) is a thin
wall sleeve, threaded as a nut.  The idea here is to tighten the 
nut and when adjusted, hammer on the sleeve to mush it into
the slot on the axle to lock it into position.  This works OK to 
lock it into position, but not only is it a one time only adjustment,
(remember you should adjust front bearings about every 10K)
WHEN the PO doesn't know that it is that type of nut, and 
attempts to remove the nut, the threads on the spindle get shredded.  
Looks like I'm in the market for a right spindle, bummer.
Most of the threads are cut real low.

Watch out for this style of nut, it can ruin a spindle.

Found a rubber brake line a little kinked, cracking and looking old,
but not leaking, yet, but I'll replace all the flexible brake lines, 
but the live in accountant SO says I can't spend anything for a 
couple of weeks, so I have a bus-on-blocks.

Items currently needed:
One axle nut for left side (left thread)
Pair of nuts for right side &amp; Bendy lock washer for front axle.
Eventually a spindle for right side.
