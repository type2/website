If you had problems with shafts as I can remember you can adjust these by
just loosening the large nut on the shaft and repositioning it. If you had a
problem fitting the body through the opening then, well, nothing you can
really do about it. I think though that all you have to do is to reposition
the shafts. Hope that works.

&gt; I went to Radio Shack and bought the one they had listed for VW buses and
it
&gt; didn't fit.  Not without some cramming, which I wasn't gonna do.  Maybe
that
&gt; other one you mentioned might fit.
