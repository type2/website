Subject: Another Steering Box Cover question
Date: Sat, 8 Apr 2000 10:28:58 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Tonight I pulled off square bottom plate of the steering box and out came
this long tube that the horn wire goes through.  I adjusted the play in the
steering box and all seems well in this department.

What I'm wondering is if the bottom plate of this ZF steering box needs to
have gaskets, o-rings, or both installed.  When I pulled off the bottom of
the steering box, there was no gasket or paper of any sort but there was a
groove in the steering box where an o-ring could have gone.  If it was there
way back when, it sure wasn't now.  I pulled some gummy sticky remains out
and now I'm retty sure that this box takes on o-ring on the bottom plate and
the Bentley says nothing about this.  Can any verify the O-Ring theory?
