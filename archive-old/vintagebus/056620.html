Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome '02 dates?

Jerome Jamboree XII is scheduled for September 14, 15 this year.

We'll be raffleing off a 1966 single cab for our $0.50 raffle ticket price!!

The SC is living with the body man at the moment and is in need of a pair of 
fender wells incase anyone out there has a pair they could donate or sell 
cheap to the club.

Thanks in advance,

Jon Stanton
President, ABC
