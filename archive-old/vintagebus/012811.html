You've probably found the problem.  The top of the air filter on one
carb doesn't have as much constant vacuum as the inlet duct of an oil
bath air cleaner.

Unfortunately, you seem to want the dual carbs, so the original oil
filter is probably not what you want to use.

My suggestion is to go to a paper or oiled-foam filter element.  It
might increase vacuum just enough to solve your problem.

Comment on K&amp;N filters:  Gauze filters are very popular with the
racing crowd, as they are low restriction and don't clog up.  They
stop sand grains and small birds, but are not very good at filtering
out small particulates.  The racers don't care about this since small
particulates won't affect their engine's continued running for the
duration of a race, and race engines will probably be rebuilt
frequently anyway.

For street use, the small particulates are detrimental to long engine
life.  Since the air is generally cleaner in street use, you don't
need to worry about clogging, so there is no reason to use a gauze
filter.  For stock installations, the oil bath filter is best.  If you
are running non-stock carbs, then you should run either paper or
oiled-foam.
