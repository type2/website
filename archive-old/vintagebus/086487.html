These links work fine.  The contents are text only, no pictures.

These links are to messages in the vintagebus mailing list archive...these
are messages that were sent to the mailing list in the past.  Since the
list is text only email, the archived messages are the same. ;)

I'll be the first to admit that the archive could use some sprucing up
though. (and I spent many many many many hours a few years ago building a
system to doit, but never got it finished....)
