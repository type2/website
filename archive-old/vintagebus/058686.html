Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver, Newer truck parked


Not looking for flames but...

I bought one of those kits and was not pleased.  The fan was extremely 
noisey, although it worked okay, and the switch was lousy since it became 
very hot during operation.  This was installed by the book.  I deinstalled 
it and put it away.  Perhaps the boat fan would work better but I haven't 
seen them so I couldn't say.

&gt;
&gt;It is a small fan that fits onto the 3&quot; heater channel that goes from the
&gt;engine to the defrost/heater vents. You cut out a section and clamp this 
&gt;fan
&gt;in and run a switch to the dashboard. It improves the heat flow by about a
&gt;million percent. It blows heat even when you are at an idle.
&gt;
&gt;There is a company that sells a kit advertised in Hot VWs that is not 
&gt;wildly
&gt;overpriced, but it is available at any good boating store. Just ask for a 
&gt;3&quot;
&gt;inline fan.

&gt; &gt; What is &quot; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT
&gt;IDEA!!!!) &quot; as Denis Dodson wrote?
&gt; &gt; P &amp; C
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!) and
&gt;drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this 
&gt;month.
&gt;Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their raingutter
&gt;towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on top.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes fun out of driving.
