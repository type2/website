I have two elephant ear side view mirrors just waiting to be installed on my
66' bus, however, the pins that are currently in the hinges are completely
rusted in.  I have attempted to knock them out but no luck.  Instead, I have
decided that my best bet it to find a set of hinges for both front doors and
simply swap them out with the existing ones.  Any idea on where I can find
these?  I have checked with WCM and other after market shops but they don't
seem to be in production.  If anyone has a good pair of hinges, I am
interested.  Thanks.
