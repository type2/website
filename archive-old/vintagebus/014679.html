Well, I didn't exactly ask for the dogs to be let loose....  But, since you
mentioned it.  The radio worked when it was removed from the car.  Therefore
I believe that the radio works.  I wouldn't have kept the radio if it
didn't.  But, since it was removed a while ago I am not making ANY promises
for reasons you have already stated.

The only reason that I listed it here is that I have those and many other vw
items (a barn full) in good shape that I thought some of the listees might
be interested in.  I am perfectly happy selling through e-bay and locally,
but was willing to sell to the listees that may want some of the items.

For those of you who are interested, I am slowly cataloging all of the parts
that I have and will be eventually (prolly this summer) posting them at
www2.50megs_dot_com/veedubparts .

For those of you who like to badger about things like this.....  JUST IGNORE
THIS MESSAGE!!!!

I always wonder why people criticize when all the intention was to let
people know what was out there and try and help people.....

Anyway....  Back to more important things.
Mike

&gt;&lt;&lt;This radio is in excellent condition and is a rare find. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Mike,
&gt;Actually this model is one of the easiest to find though what you have
&gt;looks
&gt;to be in great condition.  Used between 1955-60 in the bus.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt;There is no guarantees on the working condition of the radio, but I
&gt;believe
&gt;that it operates just fine. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Oh please!  Unless you are some kind of electronic faith healer, just state
&gt;that you do not know!  Foil type Condensors unlaminate and many other parts
&gt;can and will go bad due to age/corrosion.  Plus this is a tube type radio,
&gt;which tubes are well known to go bad at any time.  Even with the later
&gt;Sapphire radios from the 1960s being all transistor if you by good
&gt;condition
&gt;used, but unknown radios of this type you are lucky to get a working one
&gt;out
&gt;of buying ten.
