Subject: 34pict3 madness!!!!!

OK,

10 days ago with the help of John, I thought we had the carb problem 
beat. 9 days ago it started all over again - stalling out on 
deceleration and wavery idle usually ending in a stall. I have become 
the zen master of jumping out of the bus at stop lights to adjust the 
carb ( all to the the delight and dismay of rush hour traffic. ) I 
have re-tuned the bus twice and replaced all the ignition components. 
I have sprayed the new manifold boots and the manifold to head 
connections to test for vac leaks and found none. I also checked the 
throttle bushing and vac connections to the carb and found no leaks. 
I was sure that I did not botch the carb rebuild but I am a crappy 
mechanic so ...........

This morning I arrived at work early and changed the points and 
condenser just to be sure. Nothing.

On Monday I called Foreign accents to inquire about a new carb. 
Scott, the owner went ahead and ordered one for me and it was to 
arrive later this week. At lunch it was pouring down rain so I drove 
up the street to the self car wash and pulled in. Out came to the 
tools, tach dwell and timing light. After serious fussing I was able 
to obtain and idle but it was wandering between 800 and 1000 and 
would not hold steady. Gotta be a vac leak but where?

I called Scott for some free advice. Instead Scott told me to come by 
the shop after work and he would have a look pro bono.

I want to interject that I have carefully read and studied the 68 to 
79 bus Bentley as it pertains to the 34 pict 3 carb. The carb is most 
likely from a 71 to 73 beetle.

I drove to FA without stalling was but running rich. I pulled into 
the bay and told Scott all I had done. He listened looked and 
searched for just the right screwdriver. He asked me If I had 
adjusted the air idle jet on the right side of the carb? No. 
Honestly, I could not find any reference to that anywhere in my books 
or rebuild kit instructions. I did not even look like a jet to me. I 
had it screwed all the way in. He backed it out and got a smooth 
idle. Then he pinged it so it would not move.

Where did I miss this this? I followed the Bentley instructions to 
the T and no deal. Scott, who has worked on AC VW s for 25 years 
grabs a screwdriver and fixes in seconds what I have struggled with 
for over a week. Dont get me wrong I am overjoyed that Scott it 
running for me but can some one run down what the Bentley is leaving 
out about turning screws?

As soon as I get my engine lid fixed I am gonna bring a 12pack over 
to Foreign accents to say thanks!

Thanks
