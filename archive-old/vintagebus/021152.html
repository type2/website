Subject: Valve adjustment!

Yesterday I did my 3000mi regular service on my
Sundial Camper and I just had to share this to the
list.
I bought a NEW Mexican 1600 engine from Ronnie of
Havasu (Thanks Ronnie) two years ago this month and
have been soo happy with the enging to date. I never
have to add oil between changes and it has never
leaked a drop anywhere. I have put on twenty five
thousand miles in the two years without ANY trouble or
concerns.
The point of all this is, yesterday as usual when
adjusting the valves, not a single valve needed any
adjustment at all! And this is the hottest summer on
record with temps averaging 95+ all summer.
The engine sounds the same as day one and is still
smooth as ever.

Just had to share this with the list....
