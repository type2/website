The problem with trailer tires is that they are speed rated for 55 only, if
they seperate on you and distroy your wheel wells and/or your bus I hope you
have good insurance as the tire manufacturer will not warrenty a trailer
tire on a passenger vehical. A trailer tire has a totally different ply
construction as a passenger tire as the are made to go straight and not take
the abuse of turning as on the front of a bus. I looked into trailer tire as
there is the correct size and ply rateing but after researching as to why
they are trailer tires I got an education from people in the know. Good Luck

Firestone makes a 6 ply 205 75/15 which is about as close as you'll get to
the original size. I do have access to 195/15 8 ply tires but the problem is
they are an export tire and do not have a DOT stamping on them and they are
tube type, but was told again by the person in the know that they will run
tubeless. In India and third world countrys 195.15 6 or 8 ply tires are very
common, now if we could only get some one to go to Mexico and get some!!!!

ps. the export tires are around 45.00 dollars a piece and are in stock in L

Hi Mario,
We just got a pair (See info below.) of these about two weeks ago and have 
installed them on the rear of our 1963 SC.  They have worked very well under

heavy loads and do not produce the tire noise/whine that some of other tires

we have previously tried.  We also had them swedged for more traction.  
Bought these from Discount Tires for a little over $100.00 each and they are

warrentied for 40,000 miles on a much larger heavier vehicle which should 
mean they will last about 60,000 - 80,000 miles on a bus.  Eric&amp;Barb

ST 205/75R15  For Trailer Use Only  Load Range C
Max Load 826 KG (1820 LBS.)  At 345 KPA (50 PSI) Cold
Carlise Radial ST  Tubless  Made In USA
4 Plies Under Tread (2 Plies Polyester, 2 Plies Steel.)
Sidewall: 2 Plies Polyester.
They look to be about 26.5&quot; in diameter measure at the shoulders of the 
tread, the websight for this tire company lists them as 27&quot; diameter
mounted. 
 The profile looks to be very flat sided so these probably will be very good

for use in pre-1963 bus shorter and narrower rear wheel wells.  We will be 
checking this out on our 1960 panel bus sometime soon to see how they work
on 
both the front and rear axles.  EEE&amp;B
