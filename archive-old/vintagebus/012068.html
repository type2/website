Subject: re:valve cover gaskets
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have only had to do this operation once(I've only had the bus for a few months). I believe my gaskets were cork, so I replaced them(also reccomended by Muir.

The Fel-Pro Neoprene Gasket sounds like a great solution, where can you get these, should FLAPS have them?
