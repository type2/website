&gt;Ok. Heres the deal. I got the red light to go off, changed the generator
&gt;brushes. Now the van stays running, sort of. Sometimes when I start it up
it
&gt;revs up real high, then dies down. It won't idle, it jsut bogs out. Only
&gt;stays running if I keep the throttle partway down, and I really have to rev
&gt;it up if it starts to bog out to keep it running.
(snipazoid)
&gt;I have a 1971 beetle block,
&gt;w/ other parts from god knows where, so I don't know where to set my
timing.
&gt;I have two notches on my pulley, if that helps.

Sounds more like a vacuum leak. A big one, and the screwed up carb
adjustments that go with it. Single port or dual port? Check the gaskets
and/or boots on the intake. Timing may well be off too, what distributor do
you have? Block (case) doesn't matter. Timing goes with the dizzy.
