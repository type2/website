Subject: Repainting a bus with unoriginal colors, decrease in value?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone. Quick question. I am greatly considering getting my bus 
painted. Right now it has the original paint on it which is in good 
condition. It is Pearl White/Green color scheme. I have always liked the 
Chestnut Brown/Sealing wax red colors and I am considering these for the new 
paint job. How will this affect the value of the bus in the end? I do plan on 
keeping it but you never know what could happen. So, original or unoriginal? 
I am very curious to know.. Thanks in advance for your replies.

    Best wishes,
