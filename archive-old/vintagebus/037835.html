&gt; If you have a bus long enough and handle things this way, i can see 8k coming around after about 2 1776 motors and a tranny replace... mebbe 5-6 years?
&gt; 
That's lame, you can't count replacement of the same components, otherwise, I've spent like $5k on tune-ups over the years.  I could say my Notchback has about $30 or $40k invested, too, since I have all the records back to 1967.  But I'll settle for $20k...not!  ;p

Nothing against you, Stephen, just a general comment.  :)
