Subject: Short Turning Radius on 64 SC

After Driving Eric's P. Bus Sprout I realized my turning radius on the
64 single cab is way short compaired to Eric's and what he said to all
other splits he's driven, I thought that mine was normal and that's how
all splits buses where. Any one know what the turning radius should be?
What might be the problem with mine? How can I correct it?

And you all know I appreciate any advice!

Meredith
