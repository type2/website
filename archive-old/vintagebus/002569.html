Subject: Schofield Panels in the US??

Is there a source in the US that carries most of the Schofield panels?  I've
decide to make a Camper out of my 67 Panel, since I can't find one
reasonalby priced that I like.  The thing has been hit on the left nose and
need most of the corner replaced.  If I can replace it and take most of it
out.  I can straighten the nose panel.  This thing is just to solid
underneath to not use it.  Anyone need to cargo doors from a Panel?  Trade
them for to with Windows. Oh by the way, I've looked at Rocky Mountain and
Wolfsburg.
