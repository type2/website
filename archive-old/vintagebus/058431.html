Subject: RE: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

When I rebuilt my 67 Mercedes 230 the block was also without a stamp. The
Mercedes dealer said that when they rebuild and engine they transfer the
original engines code to the new block with an extra three digit number
identifying the year it was replaced. Since I rebuilt my own, it has no
numbers on it. Whoever is driving a 67 230 straight six silver and blue
Mercedes with no engine number, that was probably mine !

If you had a Mercedes and you put a new short block in it, it comes with no
engine number. Part of the repair procedure is to stamp the original engine
number in to the new one. And yes, there is factory time guide operation
code
to do this.
Nothing illegal as far as Mercedes is concerned.


&gt; My 1500 motor for the tipper is almost complete starting from a 'no
number'
&gt; case, rimco cw crank, rods, etc, and correct tin from Ronnie (oldvolks)...
&gt; inside it won't be as correct as maybe I'd like (it's actually a 1600 due
to
&gt; shear bull headedness of Glenn who is building it... &quot;No one will be able
to
&gt; tell except you on all the mountain passes around you&quot;) but from the
outside
&gt; it will look as stock and og as possible... and if not, I'll change what
&gt; ever people complain about ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I'm tempted to stamp the case with the original serial number and
a
&gt; few people have told me this is highly illegal(!)  Accordingly, I called
&gt; both the DMV and the state police here in Oregon and both referred me to
the
&gt; other... typical bureaucracy :-)   I explained that this was a restoration
&gt; process and I wasn't doing it to hide anything, just to be retentive.
They
&gt; both responded that they didn't see anything wrong with it since they look
&gt; only at the chassis number of an older vehicle such as this.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts, suggestions, insight, or previous experience?
