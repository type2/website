Yeh, that's just the right way to do things. I've got a bus that I made a
deal to sell quite a while back. Still got it in my possession. Buyer is a
good guy &amp; I'm totally cool with whatever. I've had many oppurtunities to
sell it for much more than the deal I made on it since then though. But to
me, it's just not good business. I had one guy INSIST I sell it to him.
What a dork!

The &quot;Karma&quot; pays off. I recently scored a nice bug convertible for my wife.
Got it for a song. The owner had a few other people try to get it before I
picked it up. She stuck to her deal and even threw in a bunch of goodies
'cause as she said, &quot;it's going to a good home&quot;.
