I'm looking at buying a '67 Bug.  The lady is asking 1800 and says it has
just had a rebuild on th the engine.  

What's going rate? and where can I find it? The online Blue books that I
have found so far don't go back that far, and I understand that special
options etc make it hard to give a good estimate, but is there a guideline
out there.  I have looked online at various ones for sale, but the prices
vary so wildly it's useless for me.

Thank you,

Mark
