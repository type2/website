&gt; Any thoughts?  I guess I will be rushing out to full-flow filter the case,
&gt; and mebbe get a big oil pump....

What you want a big oil pump for? Them extra ponies making you squeamish?
You add a whole bunch of extra bearings that you need to pump oil to? If so,
then get one. If you just have a bunch of extra money you want to throw in
the street, then send it my way. For the price of that big oil pump I will
provide you with a written warranty that says the stock one will do fine. I
rarely think a big sump is a good investment, like maybe on a drag car, hill
climber, or something with godawful acceleration like my singlecab when the
2275 is running, and that is only because the pump can starve for oil when
it is all piled against the sides or back of the case. I have yet to see the
case where a big oil pump is anything but a power robbing money
redistribution system and that includes drag cars, hill climbers, and my
singlecab. I ain't saying I am any kind of authority, excepting maybe
Tequila consumption, but put your money to good use, don't waste it on
things that make the bus worse. Big pumps are for newbies, you've been
around for a minute.
