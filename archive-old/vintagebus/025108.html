My odometer says 39,000 mi.  Given that my 60 came with a bastard 40 hp, most of
which, so i've read, didn't make it past 45,000 mi., and that my 40 year old
floor mats look like they were made last week, and that the rubber on my pedals
is in better shape than on my wife's ch*v truck, and that my seats and interior
are like new (after a few hours with Simple Green - thanks Clara - i'll get a
black sabbath 8-track off to ya as soon as i find one).  I am convinced my 39,000
are original miles. I figure the bastard bit the dust and my bus was parked in
some field since the early 60's.

Given that your bus was licensed at least twice - originally and then in 80 - i
would say that makes it less that your 65,000 are original and that you are
missing an original motor (what happened to it - must of had problems if it isn't
there - would seem more likely that engine replacement problems occurred at
165,000 than 65,000.)  But of course those are only indicative and not
determinative (wow, did i say that.)
