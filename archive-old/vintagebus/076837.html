Subject: Caravan to Havasu

Finally!

The holidays are over and now the best show of the year is just around the 
corner.

Looks like a few SV2'ers and listees will be heading out to Havasu on Friday 
morning.

Anyone who wants to join in on the caravan, feel free to drop me a p-mail for 
details.

We will be leaving the Temecula area around 10am on Friday, up the I-215 to 
the I-10 then Hwy 62 to Parker then up to Havasu.

In addition, a few of us plan to outdo the dinner we had last year, so also 
p-mail if you're interested in eating or cooking.
