So all the berg trans does is tighten the spacing between gears?

&gt; Just to clear the air, the above sentence annoys the hell out of me. A Berg 5 will
&gt; not get you a true 5th gear, but another gear ratio somewhere between 2nd and 3rd.
&gt; The final drive of a Berg 5 in 5th is the same as a stock tranny in forth. My
&gt; reason for wanting to do a 5 speed tranny is basically to see what I can do. I've
&gt; done straight axle kits, IRS trans kits, late IRS trannies into Swing axle with
&gt; reduction boxes, Berg 5's into Bugs &amp; T III's, etc. What I have never done is a
&gt; true 5 speed conversion. If I am going to do this I want a *true* 5th gear not an
&gt; extra one between 2nd and 3rd.
