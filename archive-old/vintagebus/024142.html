&lt;&lt; OK, before I get too excited about a Okrasa 36 hp in my '59, I want to
 clarify what is the correct engine that should be in it in the first place.
 I know VW changed to the 40 hp late in 59 or in 60 but I can't remember.
 
 My chassis number is  469869.
 
 Also, how can I tell if I have the original engine?
  &gt;&gt;
thanks for including you VIN, as it was a mid year change.   The &quot;modified 
36hp&quot; motor aka bastard 40hp was introduced at CH # 469 447 on May 19 1959.   
There also changed at this point to the tunnel case tranny from the split 
case tranny.  So, yours is one of the very first post 36hp buses.   In the 
36hp buses it is a bit tricky installing a motor with the later heater boxes 
as they tend to hang up.   

I seriously doubt you have the original engine, as those bastard motor tended 
to self destruct, which is why they were only made a short time, very 
embarassing for VW.   Check the engine number and look in the back of your 
Idiot book and see if it is in the right area.   The original motor would not 
have a Letter before the number.
