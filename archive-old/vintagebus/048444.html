Subject: Re: Guages in fresh air box

I have this arrangement on my 60 Crew cab. You do not need to drill any
holes except in the side of the fresh air box itself. Use grommets and
drill this hole above the headliner panels. There is a hollow rail on
either side of the dash where the interior light wire runs. Find where that
goes and fish a wire through. Tie and tape your wires for the guages onto
that wire and pull them through. I have two guages up there and used larger
wire than I needed so it took running wires on both sides. It looks clean
and just pull the wires and replace the panel and no one will know what you
have done.
