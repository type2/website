Subject: RE: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

Just curious,

	How long does it take someone to swap out their tranny for one of 
these assuming they would keep their reduction boxes?

	Also, can you get trannys that are complete from redux box -&gt; 
redux box.  

	One more, is there anyplace that you can send your reduxtion boxes 
to where they can be rebuilt?

	thanks
