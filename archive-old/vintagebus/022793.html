&gt;I don't think Taylor posted his WOT speed (at least 65), but that he kept it 
&gt;to about 60, as he felt the bus was more comfortable at that speed than 
&gt;driving as fast as possible, ie that he didn't want to drive WOT 

No, I never posted my WOT speed cause I've never taken it WOT! :) I don't
think I've ever chosen to take it over 63mph!  I would much rather go easy
on the motor at 60mph and take longer to get somewhere than rush and have
to replace the motor after a while.  Maybe I'm paranoid, maybe I don't need
to drive like that...but I *want* to!  All I was looking for were some
guesses as to what a 1500 w/ 67 trans would turn at 60mph.  I didn't care
about the math or exactly what kinda tire I had, I just wanted an estimate.
 So I found an old repair manual from 67 here at the house and it gave
speeds _at_ 3800rpm for each gear.  I just did that math and was satisfied
with the results. End of story.  :)

1st gear: 253.3 rpm/mph
2nd gear: 140.74 rpm/mph
3rd gear: 82.61 rpm/mph
4th gear: 55.88 rpm/mph

So at 60mph, I'm turning about 3352rpm.  It may not be dead-on, but it
sounds about right and I'm happy with that.  :)
