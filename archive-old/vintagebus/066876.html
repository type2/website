&gt;I saw a comparison chart last week someone on the list drew up comparing
&gt;chevy, ford, dodge and our beloved vw trucks.  one thing that lept out
&gt;at me was mpg listed as 29.

I posted that message ( http://www.type2_dot_com/~splittyreflect/msg41547.html )
and the 29 mpg was a mistake.  It's 29 miles per _Imperial_ gallon, which
is 24 miles per _US_ gallon.  That's for a 1500 with 28 PICT 1, and is
measured according to DIN 70 030.

Page 145 of the '69 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; at the doc project gives more
MPG ratings.  Page 146 of the '73 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; gives the rating
for a 1600 Bus at 22.4 MPG.

&gt;What can be done to maximize mpg?

Lose weight (either you or the Bus).  Drive slower.  Make sure there is
enough air in your tires.  Use thinner oil in the engine and transmission
(may not be good for either, but will give you better mpg).  Tune it up
regularly.  Use different jets in the carb.  Use the right distributor.
Change to closed-loop fuel injection.  Add an electric motor to create
a hybrid drivetrain.
