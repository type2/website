&gt;OK, the wire with the loop that has 12 volts when you turn the key on 
&gt;goes to the bolt that sticks out of the top of the alternator right?

No.  The bolt is the alternator output and should be connected via
a fat red or red-with-some-kinda-stripe wire to the battery positive.

&gt;and this bolt should have at least 13 volts when running w/o having 
&gt;the wire hooked to it, right?

IF you have the regulator hooked up, then this bolt will have voltage
on it.  If you don't have the regulator hooked up you won't get anything
out of this bolt.  

&gt;This came out of a 73 ghia and I didn't grab the regulator before I 
&gt;sold the car, so I have a standard bosch regulator that I picked up
&gt;at the last swap for a buck.

Could be a Motorola alternator as Karl observed.  You need to get the
right regulator to match your alternator.  If the alternator says &quot;Bosch&quot;
on it, a random Bosch regulator will probably work kinda-sorta but you
may not get the maximum possible output from the alternator.  If the
alternator has the bat-wings logo on it 
http://www.motorola_dot_com/images/motologo.gif it's a Motorola and the
Bosch regulator has less of a chance of working.

&gt;I have not installed it yet.

That's a big part of your problem.  The alternator won't charge without
the regulator.

&gt;Back to the alternator, there are 3 prongs coming out of the top to
&gt;the left of the bolt that sticks up, they are labled, but when in the 
&gt;ghia they went to a female plug that snapped right on and to the 
&gt;regulator.

Right.  The plug is probably about an inch around, and the terminals are
three sides of a square.  IIRC these are just normal push-on terminals
and you can hook up to them with regular push-on female connectors.

&gt;I am befuddled and currently searching for a 73 ghia wiring diagram.

http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring has very good coverage on all wiring
diagrams for air-cooled VWs.  In your case, though, you probably want to
look at the '74 Bug diagram at
http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/1303_USA_from_August_1973-1.jpg as
it's closer to what you have.  Look at the far left side - C is the 
alternator and C1 is the regulator.  On the alternator, B+ is the bolt,
while D-, DF, and D+ are the three terminals all together.  They connect
to the corresponding terminals on the regulator, and the blue wire to
the front for the warning light connects to D+.

Get the right regulator for your alternator and wire it up as per the
diagram, _then_ try and figure out if your alternator is charging.
