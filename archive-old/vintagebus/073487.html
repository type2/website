Subject: Re: [VB] trannypull HELLLLLLP!!!! A quick answer would make us
  happy.

the tap and wait advice sounds good.  Don't be surprised when things get 
rusty and stuck after a few decades.  It's not a 12 year old car anymore.  people 
born after you bus was buildt can legally drink now.

apply grease to the area when reassebling.  grease is good. grease delays 
rust.   wipe grease all over your bus.  well, at least in the moving parts and 
fasteners you would like to be able to undo again without cusswords.  Have you 
lubed your hinges recently?

We've been trying for an hour to pull a tranny out of a '78 bus.  We followed 
the Bently procedure and removed the square head screw from the shift rod.  
Why won't the shift break free of the input shaft of the transmission?  It 
appears that there may be some rust where the two units join. We've used PB 
blaster and a hammer but can't get them apart. The tranny is level and lined 
up 
(again).
