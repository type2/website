&gt; I saw this on a local bus the other day, in the middle of the rear

the idea is that it allows you to see the tyke on a tricycle directly
behind the bus, below the window.

Putting it dead center isn't a good idea as it blocks the normal view.  It
will work just as well if you stick it in the corner of the rear window.
