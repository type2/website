Hi- Today I bought a pair of springs for my front door handles. The two
springs were identical which the guy at the VW store said is what I
needed. The one I put in the passenger side seems to fit fine but I can't
make the one for the driver's side fit into the handle. Should there be a
left side and right side spring or do I need to modify this one? Thanks
for any suggestions.
