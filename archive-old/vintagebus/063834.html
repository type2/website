Subject: RE: [VB] 009 with 30-3 Question Again!

	Being a novice at this I just put in a 1776 engine with a 110
engle cam in my bus with a 009 Dist and two 34 baby Dell carbs. I set
the timing at 5 degrees at idle but some years in the dummy book show
7.5 degrees advance. I guess my question is while everyone is on this
subject is  when at 3000-3500rpm you should be at 28-30 advance or is
that just for Eric's setup? I had good power for the first 500 miles and
then it started to drop off. I have stopped driving it so that when I
get a chance I can check the valves just to make sure that there not to
tight(hopefully tomorrow). But I want to make sure that my timing is
correct as well. I have a new coil and new electronic ignition that was
just installed after the drop off with no positive effect.

PS: Engine is a brand new Engine from BAP out of Arizona

Thanks to all that answer this because I don't want to damage this new
engine.

&gt; &gt; Best be with a 009 is to set the total advance to 28-30 degrees, and
let
it
&gt; &gt; fall where it wants at idle.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; The problem with that proceedure is that then the timing at idle can
be
&gt; anywhere, including 28-30 degrees like Eric's sister's 1969 bus which
had
a
&gt; frozen advance system.  If timed only as you recommend this would
really
have
&gt; the engine running hot at idle and including probable detonating from
being
&gt; too advanced at low RPMs.

By using a timing light to set the total advance, you would be able to
see
where the timing settles at when it goes back to idle.  If you let off
the
gas, and see that the timing doesn't go down very far, or not at all
like in
Eric's sister's bus, then you know you have a problem with the advance,
and
can fix it.  None of us drive around with known bad parts, do we?  Well,
I
have, in a pinch. lol.  :-)

At idle, there is no load on the engine, so it's not nearly as crucial
as
where the timing is at during a high load condition, such as cruising
down
the highway.  Obviously, you don't want it way out of whack, but a
'working'
009 will settle down low enough.  That's why the 009 is better suited to
be
timed for it's max advance, and let it go where it will at idle.
Running
too retarded while going down the highway, is a good way to cook the
exhaust
valves, and drop seats.  I've seen an engine turn its exhaust pipes
orange
hot while it's timing was set to 27 degrees _at_ 3000 rpm after running for
only 10 minutes during break in.  Engine was shut down, and retimed to a
total of 32 degrees max, and we finished the cam break-in with no
problems.
Too retarded at higher rpm (especially under load), will kill a motor
just
like too much advance at higher rpm (especially under load).

&gt;  Also if memory serves correctly VW stated as long
&gt; as any distributor reached 20 BTDC _at_ 2,500 RPM it was acceptable to
the
VW.

I've never heard of this before.  Sounds like bad news to me.

Of course, running the correct distributor for the engine is the ideal
solution, which in a lot of the cases, the 009 is not.
