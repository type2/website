busier than you think...
if you figure the avg bus production was 175,000 units per year 
in the mid 60s even without a vacation or holiday or power
outage they would have had to make nearly 500 busses a day

&gt; &gt; I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966 production, 874th '67
&gt; &gt; off the line).  My production plate reads:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 05 7
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm.... this presents a question:
&gt; How many buses did VW build in one day??
&gt; 
&gt; My 67 Standard was built on 05 7 also. It is #000625.  If you subtract this
&gt; from yours, 874, that means at least 250 were built/assembled on July 5th?
