hey volks,

anyone live near castle rock, co? i'm looking for someone to go and
pickup/retrieve a gas heater i sent to jb's  heater service 2 months ago. i
sent this jerk an nos, yes nos, vwoa/stewart warner gas heater for a split
window bus. it was still in the original box, even still in the original
plastic. all i asked him  do was to go over it and make sure it was ok to
use. he told me it'll take him two weeks. i said fine, lemme know the total
when you're finished. one month later, i called and he said in a couple
days. well, this has been going on since then and now the jerk just hangs up
when he here's my voice! and now it's cold here in ohio and i'm pissed. so
i'm looking for someone to go and get the damn thing and send back to me.
yep, i'll pay for the service. any guido's out there ;-) (just kidding,
really).

anyway, let this serve as a warning to anyone looking for gas heater
service. i tried ark &quot;the heaterman&quot; mirvis last year and now jb's. both
with the same end result. me with no heater. this time minus an nos one no
less! BUYER BEWARE!

sorry for the rant. but given the time of year, i thought some may benefit
from my loss.

does anyone know of an HONEST and DEPENDABLE person to service gas heaters?

btw, i'm writing an article called &quot;gas heater nazi's&quot; for a vw rag. really.

again, sorry for the rant.

tony
