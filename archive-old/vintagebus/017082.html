Today 9 passengers and I climbed into my 66 deluxe and drove about an hour 
to a town to go shopping and see a movie.  The movie was absolute trash and 
we left it but the day was still good. We must have looked like clowns all 
of us getting out of that thing. The little bus ran kinda hot with ten 
passengers but we made it just fine. All the passengers (high school and 
college kids, church group) had a great time just cruising in the bus and 
listening to our music. The power of a bus to inspire 10 people to sit 
shoulder to shoulder in 100+ degrees for an hour long drive. We were all 
sweaty but it was worth it.
