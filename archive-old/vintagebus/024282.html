Subject: re: front emblems

I have never seen the repops...anyone
compared them...

I have and they are not exactly like original.  Real close though.  The
way the edges curve is a little off.  Also the chrome plating isn't very
good.  If you are restoring a bus I would definitely try to find a
original used one and have it chromed.  It will last longer than the
repop one.
