Hello Volks!  Thanks to Don Boneau of Sandy Eggo, CA who btw is on the
VintagVW list (I'm xposting this msg.), my cylinder shims showed up
yesterday (Friday.)  Not even 2 full days had transpired and this 2nd day
package made it halfway across the country.  Sure is nice when that happens.

First thing I did was use the dial calipers to check and see if the shims
were made correctly (which they were.)   Choosing the appropriate set, I set
about putting the #1 &amp; #2 side of the engine together.  As Glen Hadley (of
the VintagVW list as well) confirmed, I had extended my pushrod tubes WAY
too far.  I had extended them to about 1 1/4&quot; longer than when fully
compressed and really, they only needed to be extended about 1/4&quot; total.
I'll make sure on the 3 &amp; 4 side to shorten them up a bit before trying to
get the head on.

Since I'm kind of jumping the gun here, lemme back track a minute.  I tipped
the engine on the stand so that the 1 &amp; 2 side was elevated (but not
straight up).  I soon found out that when installing the first P/C on
whatever side of the engine, you pretty much have clear access for
installing the wrist pin clips.  However, when installing the 2nd P/C,
access is blocked between the 2 cylinders so I had to remove one of the
P/C's, install the wristpin clip, and then put it back together.  I also
followed the Berg instructions and used a light layer of silicone sealant
(ie - orange RTV) between the shim/case and the cylinder/shim.

As mentioned above, the pushrod tubes were too long (my fault.)  After
installing the seals on the either end and kind of horn swaggling the head
on (tricky job at best!), I ended up creatively using a rubber mallet and a
ratchet strap to draw the head up until the studs were poking through.  The
rest of the snugging up was done the standard way with the head nuts and
torque pattern/spec.

After that was completed, in went the pushrods, the rocker assembly, (I've
ordered swivel foot adjusters from Bugpack and they haven't arrived yet) and
then the stock valve adjusters.  I gapped everything to .006 and then
rotated the engine and boy do I feel resistance.  This is good!  It means
I've got my compression back!!!

By this time, I was tired but wiser and turned in for the night.  Here it is
Saturday morning about 8:30CST - I'm sitting here with some toast, milk, I'm
in my PJ's (man I'm glad I don't have a webcam hooked up to this thing) and
I'm anxious as hell to get to work on this engine.  I'm sure by the end of
the day, I'll have a heck of lot more to post about so TTYL!
