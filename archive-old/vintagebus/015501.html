Thanks everyone for the updates on the gas situation
out west.  We had an awesome trip.  I think I saw more
VWs in Oregon than in Washington or NorCal.  I did see
a few splits though and countless bays.  Anyone on
list have a Single Cab in a reddish-brownish primer
with a tilt in between Pebble Beach area and Redding? 
I'm sorry I can't be more specific.  It was on I-5
though probably :).  

Benj.
