All,
    Out of a box in my shed,unopened these twenty-five years came a carby I
think might be nice for my 66 van.
    As far as I know, (Strange engine #  - BMI 4949 ) its a 1500 recon, the
shaft on the fitted carb drips.
This carb is a 32 PCI-1 and it has a manual choke. I never much liked the
auto choke as the non-functioning position is choke on, but I refuse not to
have one at all.
    The PO (now a very old man) tells me he bought it with the understanding
that it was off a stationary engine of some sort, thinks he played with the
jets and had it on his kombi for a year or two.
    Here is my problem. The studs to hold it on the manifold are about 1/4&quot;
too far apart. Is there any reason I cant file the existing holes out the
proper amount and bolt it on,assuming the throat is the same size as the
standard. manifold. The PO says the manifold he bought with the carb has
&quot;gone the way of all things, sorry&quot;.
    Is anybody familiar with this, any opinion at all really.
    Thanks, Barry Wright
