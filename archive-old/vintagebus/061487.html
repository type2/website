Subject: Putting your foot in your mouth

&gt; &gt;&gt;A man enters his favourite ritzy restaurant, and
while sitting at 
&gt; &gt;&gt;his regular table, he notices a gorgeous woman
sitting at a table 
&gt; &gt;&gt;nearby, all alone. He calls the waiter over and
asks for their most 
&gt; &gt;&gt;expensive 
&gt; &gt;&gt;bottle of Merlot to be sent over to her, knowing
that if she accepts 
it, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;she 
&gt; &gt;&gt;is his for the night. The waiter gets the bottle
and quickly sends 
it 
&gt; &gt;&gt;over to the woman, saying this is from the
gentleman at a nearby 
table. She 
&gt; &gt;&gt;looks at the man, then the wine, and decides to
send a note over to 
the 
&gt; &gt;&gt;man. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;The note read: 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;For me to accept this bottle, you need to have a
Mercedes in your 
garage, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;a 
&gt; &gt;&gt;million dollars in the bank, and 7 inches in your
pants.&quot; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;The man, after reading this note, sends a note
back to her. 
&gt; &gt;&gt;It read: 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Just so you know, I happen to have a Ferrari
Testarossa, a BMW 
&gt; &gt;&gt;850iL and 
&gt; &gt;&gt;a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage, and I have over
twenty-million 
&gt; &gt;&gt;dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman as
Beautiful as you, 
would I 
&gt; &gt;&gt;cut 
&gt; &gt;&gt;three inches off my dick. Just send the wine back,
bitch.&quot;
