Subject: [VB] re:dim headlights/voltage ?'s (plus trip to canada)


not sure if you all remember bu i was working on getting the voltage up
closer to 6 at my headlight assembly. just an update post. i have been doing
a bunch of other things trying to keep this in the back of my mind turnign
over and over...

*************************************************************
This may or may not help you. I had a 65 bug years ago that had horrible
current drops to both headlights. I tried cleaning contacts and switches but
to no avail, my lights were still yellow. I finally decided to go around the
factory wiring and run two #10 wires up to the headlights, one for each
light. At each light was a 63-67 dodge/Plymouth horn relay. The light switch
now drove both relays and the relays directed the 6 volts direct from the
battery to the headlights. I had bright headlights ever since. The guy that
bought it from me commented on the fact that he had never seen a 6 volt car
with such bright lights.
