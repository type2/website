&gt; &lt;&lt;  Except a couple of years ago you drilled the jets.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Jim,
&gt; Plus the older used jets do wear out bigger, and even the new jets can be a
&gt; size or two bigger even new!  So for any carb jetting you really need a
&gt; jetting tool to measure the jets.   Eric&amp;Barb

FWIW, Weber bases their jet numbers on flow, not size, or so they claim. 
Personally, I can't imagine the inspection process to do this though. SPC no
doubt! 

Additional info:

According to Bell, refering to IDA and DCOE carbs: &quot;...the main jet size can
be selected by multiplyingt the size of the main venturi by 3.9 to 4.3 (eg. a
32mm choke will usually have a main jet size of 125 to 135...&quot; &quot; ... siamesed
inlet ports. In this instance the multipying factor is 4.6 to 5.0.&quot;

Air Corrector: &quot;...increasing the diameter of this jet, the fuel mixture is
weakened more at high rpm than low rpm. A change in the size of the main jet
changes the mixture strength uniformly at both high and low rpm.&quot;

Suggested jetting for a pair of 40IDAs on a 1750 VW.  32mm chokes, 120 mains,
160 air, F11 emulsion, 40 pump, closed bleed, 100&amp;50F10 idle w/ 4.5 aux venturi.

Jim
