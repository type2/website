Subject: Re: [VB] dillon beach report

I couldn't agree more; great chat and good volks! I'm glad you enjoyed our tales. John and I have plenty of them, all true, albeit a little stretched for a more dramatic delivery but good tales none the less! 
I know JP beat you out of the long distance award but if there was an award for &quot;Coolest Mattell Accessory&quot; I am sure that Barbie would have won!
See you at BYOB!
 
Sean
 

&quot;If you want to be the popular one at a party, here's a good thing todo: Go up to some people who are talking and laughing and say, 'Well,technically that's illegal.'  It might fit in with what somebody justsaid.  And even if it doesn't, so what, I hate this stupid party.&quot;
