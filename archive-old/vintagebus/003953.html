  I just picked up a hitch hiker yesterday after work. I was able to get him
50 miles farther down the road. He was fairly clean cut and just looked like
someone needing to get somewhere. Not like someone needing to get away from
somewhere. I dropped him off at a truck stop and gave him all the spare
change I had. He has a nice guy. He was moving to Colorado for a job and his
car wouldn't make it that far.
  I will stop for any VW on the road. I've been stranded many times and have
walked many miles. The farthest I've walked was about 6 miles with a girl
while on our first date at about midnight. My Super Beetle ran out of gas.
We told her parents what happened and they believed it. Turned out they had
a Beetle next to a barn that they quit driving because it kept leaving them
stranded. I never did get the gauge working. But the next day I started
carrying some spare gas. I will occasionally stop for non VWs. I've changed
a few flats for people, generally older people or someone who looks physical
unable to get the lugs off, and given some a ride to the next exit.
  But when I see a vehicle on the side of the road, and I can't stop or
don't want to, I don't call the Police unless it looks like there has been
an accident or a medical emergency.
  VW drivers, I find, for the most part to be pretty self-sufficient. If
they are stuck on the highway and appear to be working on something, they
are most likely fixing the problem. If you drive by the next day and it is
still there stop and see if someone is in it. If there isn't, drive by
everyday to check on it. The highway patrol will get tired of seeing it on
the side of road and sticker it. A couple of days later they will tow it. If
you can tow it to yours house before the HP tows it off, you just might have
a new Bus. Sometimes it pays not to be a nice guy.

 Just kidding!!!

 It's best to build up VW Carma on your side.You never know when you'll
brake down. I sucks to walk. That's why we drive Busses.
