The main part of the above paragraph is that I joined this list because I 
found it the most appealing to my needs. However, I never thought I'd join a 
bus list that is bus owners bashing bus owners. The way the past few emails 
have been looking, I find that the college I go to isn't even this bad on 
bashing other people with the same interests. I though VW people were the 
coolest ever. Shall I stand to be corrected? I hope not.

 You want the truth?  You can't handle the truth.  NO truth handler you.  I 
scorn your truth handling abilities!  Sorry, the truth is we all suck.  Evil 
backbiters.  Steal other people stuff all the time.    Install flat spots in 
009 distributors.  (I have the secret  factory literature that tells how to 
do this- with pictures)  Post erroneous M-code meanings.    Go on and on and 
on about our boring trips to the grocery store and back in some crusty old 
bus.       We are only cool because old buses have wimpy heat.  In fact this 
moring I'm freezing.  Did you think this list was about peace, love and 
understanding?    Well, the sixties are over. . .  the drugs wore off...  and 
 I have a middle seat to sell you.
