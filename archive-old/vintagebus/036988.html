 These are VW's designation for the keystyles. Don't know how the
 translate to the V numbers. Go to
 http://www.sv2s_dot_com/restoration/tech009.shtml to see this.
 A -- 1950-12/51 (ignition only) 
 P -- 1/52-2/55 (ignition only) 
 E,Z,D,V,F -- 1950-12/63 (all same profile but different letters -- go
 figure!) 
===================

the door key was changed for 54.  a 54 has the same door key profile as a 63, 
but a 53 came with a differnt door key.    How long does it take to find a 53 
drivers door handle?

++++++++++++++++++++++
 T -- 1/64-1966 (Erins pic with the big VW in a circle)
============
actually I thought the T series key was used from the beginning of the model 
year, yes there were 64 drivers pull handle doors that took the T key.

+++++++++++++++

 L -- 1967-1970 
 R -- 1971-1979
