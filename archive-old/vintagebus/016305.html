This subject has come up before, and I'm willing to bet that the 
discussion will be the same as it was before.

Look at it from the other side.   While people with &quot;projects&quot; in the
driveway may think they're beautiful, the rest of the neighbors call
a spade a spade: it's a non-running, rusting hulk.  I don't care if it's
a '96 taurus or a '41 schwimmwagen.  If it's sitting in the driveway rusting,
with pieces missing, and doesn't run, it's *junk*, irrespective of it's
potential as a classic.

I'm a project car kind of guy, yet I would still object to some POS 
dismembered in a neighbors driveway.   You could drive right past my house
and not know I had a project going on unless I had the garage door open at
that exact moment.

And where is it stated that people have a &quot;right&quot; to a junk vehicle?

People do not realize that having a project car comes with a responsibilty
to keep things somewhat neat.  The basic rule of thumb is to keep
your house no worse than your neighbors.  If all of your neighbors have
junk cars on the lawn, then you can too.  If they don't, you shouldn't.
If you do not like conforming to the de facto standard of the rest of the
neighborhood - MOVE.  Find a neighborhood where everyone has their cars on
blocks and feel at home.  Or rent a shop in an industrial area,
where you can rip stuff apart any time of day or night and nobody will
give a damn.  Go in on the rent with some buddies, and you can have a grand 
old time.

A project also brings with it the responsibility, although somewhat vague,
that you'll actually do something with it.  To collect a bunch of 
&quot;cars&quot; and not do anything with any of them is more along the lines of
&quot;hoarding&quot; than &quot;restoration.&quot;

&gt; any court cases that set a precedence concerning a person's right to have a
&gt; &quot;junk vehicle.&quot;  I did a search on Northern Light and am literally shocked
