Subject: Re: [VB] Transport companies

I've had four VWs shipped from the west to NJ. Had one bad experience, and 
that was with AAA Advantage in Tempe, AZ. They brokered out the job to a 
place in Miami who damaged the car and refused to pay the claim because the 
car needed some restoration work! 

I have had good experiences with White Cloud Auto Transport out of Boise 
Idaho. Small outfit, not a broker, they use their own drivers. Very nice 
folks. I used them twice and was pleased both times.

I had a decent experience with Transcar recently. Bought my SC in Moab, UT. I 
would have used White Cloud but they don't cover southern UT. Transacr took 
forever (4-5 weeks). I bugged them daily. Finally they offered to &quot;eat&quot; the 
$200 deposit (which was to be their part of the $$$) and post it on the 
driver's board at a $200 higher rate. Guess what? Once they did that, it was 
picked up in two days.

It's a scary thing, shipping a VW. My only advice is to ask others on the 
list who they have had good experiences with before placing a shipping order. 
And don't pay in full until the car arrives and you have a chance to look it 
over.
