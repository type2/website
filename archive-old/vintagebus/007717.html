From: Scott Fraser  &gt; Anybody learn how to drive in a bus?


I did. My dad took me out in the boonies and I drove down a narrow dirt
road, focusing on shifting. The road started downhill, and soon I found
myself wanting to slow down. There were trees close to the road on both
sides, the road had curves, the hill got steeper, and I couldn't find the
brake pedal! I was too focused on trying to dodge trees to be able to think
about hunting for the brake with my foot. Finally found the pedal and slowed
down, but it was quite a scare. I came to a stop and practiced hitting the
brake many times before continuing.

Then, later, when I took my driving test, the exhaust pipe actually came
loose during the test. I drove around with it dragging on the ground. Noisy!
But the examiner didn't seem to notice.

Still have the same bus 25 years later. (Trying to sell it, though; see my
seperate post)
