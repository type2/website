The following is some e-mail communication between myself and Thom
Fitzpatrick. I'm posting it so whoever may be reading this and
contempating how they can help me :-) will know the answers I have
recieved so far. Please read through it and if you can help me out from
there that would be neat-o. Thanks in advance for your time.

I have a problem with my '67 deluxe. The right rear tire had quite a bit
of side to side movement indicating the outer bearing of the reduction
box was shot. John Muir's idiot book pretty much confirmed this. Great,
so I replaced it and the output shaft was nice and solid. I had it
pretty much back together before I realized that I had forgotten to
replace the brake backing plate between the reduction box and the oil
seal retainer. I went back and did this but now the slop of the output
shaft remains even with the new bearing and the only change has been the
addition of the backing plate. I was hoping you may have some idea's,
I'm fresh out.

Did you only do one bearing or both? YOu should have done *both* - : any
slop in the outer bearing is mirrored in the inner bearing!

I did actually do only the outside bearing. For the life of me I
couldn't figure out how to get the output shaft off to get at the inner
bearing. I thought that may have been a possibility but considering my
dilemma getting at it I just did the outer and crossed my fingers.
Perhaps you could enlighten me?

Did you split the reduction box? That's how you get the shaft out.
: Split the box; remove the circlip on the top  shaft, remove the gear,
and then you can get the shaft off.
:
: Check the condition of the top bearings; they rarely go bad unless
you've run low on oil...

I split the case and removed the clip to find that the bearing was
stubborn trying to get it off. It looked fine so I just left it.
Assuming the inner, lower bearing is bad is it just a matter of elbow
grease to get the top bearing and gear off or are there
more mystery clips that I should be aware of?

No; the only other clip will be *way* inside the axle tube, and you will
not encounter it unless you're trying to remove the axles.
:
: To get the bearing off, either buy a small 3-arm puller, or use
: two screwdrivers, one on each side of the bearing, and pry it off.
: It's hard to hurt the bearing. The gear should just slide off at that
point.
:
: To get the stub axle out, you'll probably have to bang on the shaft
with a soft mallet - don't bung up the shaft! and work it back and
forth.  Sometimes they just pull out.
:
: Wait: what year bus is this again? If it's a '64 or later, then the
previous paragraph is not valid: it's a lot more complicated - I forgot
that &quot;bignut&quot; trannies you have to remove the &quot;freeze plug&quot; from the
backside of the reduction box; you have to weld a nut to the plug, use
that to pull it off, then remove it from the inside.  This also means
undoing the reduxtion box from the spring plate...

Lucky me, I have a '67. I actually did unbolt it from the spring plate
last night thinking that there was something back there that I was
missing and needed to get at. Of course I already put it all back
together. I don't have a welder... - yet. Is it
possible to get the reduction box off of the axle tube and take it to a
shop and have them tackle the freeze plug problem? Or will I need to put
it back together and drive it there and have them tear it all down
again. Do I have any options at this point?

Well, that's it. He suggested that I solicite the help of tranny
expert's at this point through the vintage bus mailing list. He assures
me that there are a number of qualified tranny guy's here. So, by all
means, speak up.

Thanks again,
Zac T. Meltzer
