Okay volks - I've got a set of air correction jets for a set of 40IDF's.  I
paid $10 each or $40 total plus shipping for these jets.  They are brand new
from Kymco, never out of the package.  I'm offering them to anyone on the
list for $9 each and free shipping for a grand total of $36.  It isn't
killer savings but they're new and you save $4.  You will need these if you
are running a 1776 engine.  Email me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com if you want
them.
