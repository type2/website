 Today I actually saw a Kombi turned into a double cab hack job.  The one
 day I didn't have my camera with me:-(  East bound on the 134 in Eagle
 Rock CA at 3 PM.  It was a fairly good job from 2 car lengths away..up
 close it was rough!  Cut above the belt line with the back top half
 grafted on to make the cab back.  One window each behind the driver/pass
 but no side door.  It was in beige and green primer.
