&lt;&lt; I tried to put a header on the motor and they said it was for a 1500 to 
1600
 and it is not close at all what muffler can I put on it do they make a
 header for a 1200 or 1300 ?

If you have a 40hp motor yes there are headers for it, but I don't know wher 
eto source them.  However, usually you can pick up an NOS 40hp bus muffler at 
a swap for about $25.   Cause there were tons around and few people run 40hp 
s in a bus.   I usually see a few of them.
