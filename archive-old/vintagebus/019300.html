Subject: Bubble roofed panel on Thom's site...
To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I just uploaded the cover to the December, 1962
Foreign Car Digest magazine to the
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ gallery area. Will also
load the starting point for this project. 99% of us
would rather have the OG logo panel bus instead. The
other 1% would have loved my barndoor. ;-) I spent all
Tuesday night (tonight) scanning and formatting the
article's photos and will cheat and drop them and the
original article text into Dreamweaver hopefully on
Wednesday night. I'll publish the url when it's done.
