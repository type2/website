Subject: Rust treatment product comparisons - Help
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

For various reasons, I have decided to do some comparison research on chemical
rust treatment products.  This research will be in the form of reviewing
product data (including MSDS's), amateur empirical testing, and summaries of
others' anecdotal experience.  For a list of products I will be looking at
please see the end of this message.  I need your help, if you have information
on the following:

1. RUST-MORT - Name and number of source for &quot;Rust-Mort&quot; (I asked this before
in separate message)
2. CLR - Name and number for source for &quot;CLR&quot; recommended by Thom
3. HYDROCHLORIC ACID - Any information on commercially available rust
treatment products which use muratic / hydrochloric acid as the active
ingredient.
4. ELECTROLYSIS - Any information or experience of using electrolysis for rust
removal.  To summarize a process I have a lead on: Negatively 12VDC charged
rusted object submersed in a bath of 1 tablespoon household lye or washing
soda per 1 gallon water with a positively 12VDC charged sacrificial iron
electrode.  
5. OTHER PRODUCTS - If you know of other rust products which I have not
listed, especially if they differ in technique / method, please let me know.
6. ANECDOTES - Finally, if you have personal experience of these rust
treatment products, I would be interested in hearing your story and including
it in the &quot;report&quot;.

Disclaimers:  
A) Perhaps this has been done before, but I can't find it, and I want to see
for myself; 
B) I know only enough about iron oxidation chemistry to be dangerous; 
C) I believe these products should only be used as a last resort for rust
removal (i.e. where panel replacement or sandblasting / grinding are not
practical); 
D) I will be reviewing only products intended for use on iron and steel; 
E) I will not be reviewing paint products such as POR-15 and Corroless.  

I will be providing a full report of my &quot;findings&quot; exclusively to the split
list by the end of July, 1998.  Please p-mail me if you have responses to my
requests or wish any information I now have.  Please don't clog up the list,
unless it is appropriate. Please.

PRODUCTS TO BE REVIEWED - grouped by methodology with manufacturer or
distributor listed (currently the methodology is assumed on my part until I
receive more information):

STRAIGHT ACIDS - these products use the acid base listed to treat the rust:
1. Naval Jelly - phosphoric acid - Loctite (as Permatex)
2. 5717S - phosphoric acid - Dupont
3. Ecotec - citric acid - Singerman Laboratories
4. Simple Solutions - citric acid - Simple Solutions
5. ?__________? - hydrochloric / muratic acid - ?_____________?

ACIDS WITH ZINC - these products use an acid (usually phosphoric) in solution
with trace amounts of zinc oxide.  The zinc oxide etches to the steel to
supply a sacrificial anode material to reduce further corrosion of the base
iron.
1. MP-7 - Must for Rust
2. Metal-Ready - Resto Motive Laboratories (makers of POR-15)
3. Miracle Rust Remover and Metal Prep - Bill Hirsch Automotive
4. OxiSolv - Eastwood
5. 5718S - Dupont (replaced 224 and 227)

POLYMER CONVERSION - these products use polymers to &quot;convert&quot; the rust to an
inert (usually black) form:
1. Extend - Loctite (as Duro)
2. One-Step - RPM (as Mar-Hyde Corp. (makers of Bondo))

CHEMICAL BONDING - this product &quot;envelopes the rust at the molecular level&quot;:
1. Rust-X - Integrity Industries

UNKNOWN METHODS - I can't make an assumption for these products due to lack of
information:
1. CLR
2. Rust-Mort / Rust-Seal

Thanks folks, and again please p-mail me at SoloHobbit_at_aol_dot_com if you have
input,
