The following may not apply to buses which need the pans for structural
rigidity, but it may give others ideas as to what is possible - 

&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Take new panels, determine several locations where access
&gt; could help clean or repair things later.

What I did at the end of the restoration of my 67 deluxe hardtop was on
the advice of the owner of the resto shop, which was to add some splash
pans to cover up the entire underside of the bus to help protect the
underbody from the elements. I had, during the resto, carefully found all
the rust on floors, crossbeams, and main frames, and had the shop's
welder-dood do the repairs, then I POR-15 sprayed everything, every
nook and crannie. Seam-sealer, POR, the whole works. The splash pans were
to be the finishing touch. 

Having a lift available in the shop made the following easier - 

I measured very carefully and created patterns for three pieces of
what eventually became galvanized sheet steel (thin, 30 mil???). A center
piece goes across from frame piece to framepiece, from in front of the
front cross memeber, to the rear cross member. Then a piece from the frame
out to the edge of the rocker channel on each side. I used Wiss snips,
then drilled the pieces and matching smaller holes every four inches or
so, into the frame and channels, POR-ed all the holes and screws on
assembly. Screws are Stainless steel pan head philips, #8 x 1&quot;. 
The pieces were all cut from one sheet 5x10', bought for 25 bucks from
Arrow Pipe and Steel, out there in El Lay.

Very solid, keeps the crap out of my nice newly done underside, and is
removable to service brake lines every hundred years or so. 

Am I bus-crazy or what?
