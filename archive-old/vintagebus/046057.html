 &lt;&lt; Is there really any point to trying to convince someone to drive their Bus
  year round?  Part of having a Bus is not having society's values crammed
  down your throat.  Unless I'm mistaken, owing a Bus is not even a 
 pre-requisite
  to joining a VW club &gt;&gt;
 
 Your just mad cause you know you dont drive your bus all the time.

seems to me that Everett drives his barndoor quite a bit.  Certainly more 
than I drive mine.     I claim bad shocks and lack of paint in a wet climate 
as my excuse.   okay, it's been sunny and dry this summer (wow) but the shock 
thing is another story.  and another post.
