Subject: Brake pedal dillema

Hi,

Current brake pedal problem was partially solved by installing the cup 
washer inside the spring as is standard up thru the early 64 model year. The 
pedal now returns almost as well as before and is satisfactory.

However, I now noticed that the snap ring, that holds the pedal onto the 
special pivot bolt, is rotating with the pedal rather than staying 
stationary. In my machine building experience, this is a no, no. The groove 
will wear out pronto.

When I disassembled the pedal, I found an O-ring just under the washer next 
to the snap ring. That O-ring does NOT appear on the Hand and Foot Lever 
drawing and parts list. Does anyone know if that O-ring belongs there? It 
would make some sense for it to be there in that it would help to keep out 
water and dirt. The O-ring is most likely what is making the washer and snap 
ring rotate.

Any knowledge out there?

Thanks,
Chris
