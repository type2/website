&gt;&gt; UHaul has a bunch of Toyota 1 Ton cab &amp; chassis', which came OEM with a

&gt;Does this make sense? I thought that a loaf was heavier, and with a full
&gt;camper kit...
&gt;You seem to be including later busses with t4 engines which are way
&gt;heavier.


I wrote &quot;small', meaning small in size.  The diameter is smaller than the
OEM splittie tire by about 1.3%.  The load rating is fine.

One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter of
26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14
