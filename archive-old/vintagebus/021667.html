 For instance, if a panel was delivered in Dove Blue, would they have
 just painted the outside, or was it common for them to re-paint the
 inside as well?   I've seen very few original logo'd panels in person.
 One that I can recall is dove blue on the inside and yellow on the outside.

i THINK THEY TENDED TO LEAVE THE CAB ALONE. oops sorry blame the cat.   Meat 
Wagon was ruby red in the cab, regular panel van iunterior w/ cab divider.   
They wanted to show the logo to the rest of teh world, the drivers know where 
there were working.  Isn't it interesting, a butchers shop delervery van 
being Ruby Red.  SIck sense of humour.
