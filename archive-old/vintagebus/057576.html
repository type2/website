Subject: Re: [VB] Interior sources

Wolfsburg west has covers that match the originals
pretty close. They are an easy do it yourself project.
My only suggestion would be to replace the drawstring
with a piece of wire. They even have the correct door
panels for that truck as well.

&gt; A buddy of mine has just sent his 67 Double Cab off
&gt; to the paint shop.
&gt; This means he needs interior stuff soon. He really
&gt; wants to have the
&gt; black and grey salt and pepper seats. They don't
&gt; have to be exactly like
&gt; original, just give the same feel as original salt
&gt; and pepper. Anyway I
&gt; was thinking about Doug Denlinger (I hope that is
&gt; the right name) or
&gt; someone like that. He is planning on putting the
&gt; covers on himself but
&gt; could be convinced otherwise. Anyway does anyone
&gt; have some good leads
&gt; for seat covers and interior stuff or Dougs number.
