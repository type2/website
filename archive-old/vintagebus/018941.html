&gt; Let's hear a leak report on the left coast safaris. My og's on the DC with og style seals leaked like a beer bong. How are the UK seals holding up? I painted parafin into the gap last season, but it was a mess to clean off last spring. Wax seeped out all summer, all over the nose.  

My CE safaris leak.  The left side leaks worse than the right for some reason.  I think
I can tighten the dash tabs and mitigate the problem slightly.  FWIW, they don't leak
nearly as bad as the wolfgang ones I had!

One trick I did to my bus to help with the leakage - I knew they would leak - was to
drill small holes in the corners of each &quot;segment&quot; of the dash tray, to give the water
a place to run out.  I'd prefer water run out on the floor rather than sit in the dash tray.

One thing I'd forgotton to do, which I did last week, was open up the holes in the 
front window slider channels.  They're supposed to drain down into the door.  I was 
driving the bus in a really intense rainstorm a while back, and they filled up with water,
spilling into the cab!

&gt; BTW, the power crisis in CA is scripted by greedy corporations. They've shut down power plants for &quot;maintenance&quot; and other bogus excuses to cause shortages.  A municipal-owned system (socialism!) in Redding, CA is making $$$ selling their extra power to the PG&amp;E grid. Years ago PG&amp;E bought up most municipal systems, shades of the gas/car/tire coalition buying up trolly systems to put 'em out of business. www.turn_dot_org has the best info. 

Yup - local version of OPEC.  And they manipulated the public into getting Rancho Seco
shut down, so the Sacramento area is SOL as well.  De-regulation of the power 
industry was the biggest scam laid on the public since Social Security.
