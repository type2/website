Subject: Stollen Bus.  So. Cal

  My neighbor had his 65 standard deluxe stolen from his driveway 2
nights ago.  Please keep an eye out for a forrest green (bottom) and
green white standard deluxe.  It was stollen from Huntington beach.  The
bus had Florida plates.  Rust around the floor boards.  1600 DP motor
with Gene Berg components

If anyone sees this bus or parts that may match the colors please let me
know.

Thanks
