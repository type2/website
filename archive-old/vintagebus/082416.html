Subject: Re: [VB] RE Rear shift rod coupler replacement

Hello Guys   No you cant the front of the shift rods on the later buses has a 
pin that will keep the rod from going forward. If you are lucky the front 
coupler will come apart then the rod will slide within itself just as Jason just 
described. I have seen these front couplers be a real PITA  as some have never 
been apart and dont want to come apart. I have also taken a screw jack from 
an Chevy truck and used it to push the tranny back enough after removing a 
bunch of bolts and cables to be able to replace the coupler.  Later and have fun
