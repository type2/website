Subject: Re: [VB] cooling options

Michael,

I am using two things to help the cooling in my 1966 DeLuxe/Camper.

1.  A porsche-style cooling shroud with high output alternator to cool the 
case/jugs/heads (very high effiency).  This fiberglass cooling shroud setup 
with a big porsche cooling fan will replace all of your upper engine tin and 
gen/alt stand. Check it out at http://www.bergmannvw_dot_com.  They are sold as 
a kit, and with a little sanding on the fiberglass, it will mate right up to 
your engine case.  (Okay, so maybe it is a lot of sanding).

2. A Kymco Super Cooler, which is an external 19-pass (or there abouts) oil 
cooler with its own personalized fan and temperature sensor.  These are 
advertised in most every HotVWs and VWTrends mags under the Kymco banner.  
Between the two of these, I never see the temp gauge even begin to threaten 
me.

Of course, these items don't come cheap.  About $1000.00 for the porsche 
cooling kit (but the 66 Amp alternator bonus comes in hand for charging my 
house batteries).  The Kymco cooler is around $200.00, I think.

Good luck, and let me know of anything else you come up with!  Oh, and I 
agree with the other guys, german tin can't be beat on a stock cooling 
setup.  The aftermarket/brazilian stuff just doesn't compare)

Richard

hi,

i am looking for ideas to provide extra cooling to my soon to be rebuilt 
1641cc engine (in my 67 kombi) without compromising style, i.e. ugly scoops. 
  has anyone seen or heard of any innovative ideas?

thanks
mike
