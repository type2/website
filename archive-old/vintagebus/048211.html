Yes pictures can be deceiving, I was told something totally different about

the 23 Deluxe, but the 53/54 panel was described pretty right on, Hell to

drive home over 2000 miles with 2 Barndoors regardless of their condition

made me feel all right, The 23 does have a lot of parts, it's totally

complete and have often do you see the fresh air scoop with AMBO fans? It's

a shame I have to cut it up but the last thing I need is another ornament in

my storage lot. I am going to cut the whole left side off and display the

logos and all. What will be available off of it is the roof clip, dash,

I thought rusty barndoor  deluxes were worth thousands.
