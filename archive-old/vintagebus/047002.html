&gt; I'm interested in shops, museums, junk yards... anything at all.  Plus I'm
&gt;  not limited to just the Las Vegas area, so if anyone knows of a barndoor
&gt;  Binz for a few hundred dollars, I guess I could drive a couple hours.  :)
&gt;  I'd love to hear about cool non-VW stuff too.

I heard there was one in Oregon, wasn't it for sale for a couple hundred
