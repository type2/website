take extra thick red wire, feed through from near starer into engine 
compartment, use push on terminal to attach to the starter actvating terminal 
on the starter.   get out from under bus, shake dirt off face, open engine 
lid.   go up front, make sure e brake is on and bus out of gear, back to 
engine compartmnet, touch wire you just hooked up to starter to hot side of 
battery.  this should activate the starter.  If this works when the key does 
not, then you know the problems is in the wires to  the front of the bus and 
back.    Clean each connection  in that circuit- at fuse box, to headlight 
switch, from headlight switch to ignition swith, at ig switch. (look at 
wiring diagram)
