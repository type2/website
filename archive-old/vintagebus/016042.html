Hi Steve, well the incorrect stuff was probably done
in the past 40 years before current guy owned it..
 
example;
-tent barckets on the roof were painted from factory
his are polished up
-front bumper tent mount is rigged up somehow
-American spec bumpers?  is that on the M -code
-ect

Check in some westy lit and ask some other westy
freak-experts like Michael Steinke and you will see
the innaccuracies on this SO-34.  Again I am not
knocking the bus and don't wanna get into a nit picky
war over dumb stuff as all in all it does not
matter...the bus is great!  I just don't think it is
as original as it was 'pressed' to be.  Just throwin'
in my 2 cents...not to beat my own drum but the one
bus I know is early westys.  I have had numerous early
westys and several all original low mileage hatc tops
too.

BTW send me your address steve I need to send you
those  CBN westy newsletters...I got 'em here!

Todd S.

&gt; &gt; I went over those pics with a fine
&gt; &gt; tooth comb...considerable incorrect or molested
&gt; items
&gt; &gt; and details...either it is original paint and had
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; bunch of detail work done and incorrectly I
&gt; add...or
&gt; &gt; it has been redone all together and being pawned
&gt; off
&gt; &gt; as original, 
&gt; 
&gt; I know the bus well, the current owner and the guy
&gt; who found it in 
&gt; Italy. I've seen all the paperwork and documentation
&gt; relating to it 
&gt; (including a personal log from the original owner
&gt; concerning every part 
&gt; he ever had changed on the bus!) There is paperwork
&gt; corresponding to 
&gt; all the options fitted on the bus. Honest. I can see
&gt; why it looks 
&gt; unbelievable though, but it really is genuine.
&gt; Should it be in a 
&gt; museum......?? Possibly, but it's great to see it
&gt; out on the road! 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also that paint just looks too fresh to me...I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; owned several low mileage all original vehicles
&gt; &gt; anywhere from 11K-40K original miles and even with
&gt; &gt; spectacular paint they do have a certain &quot;patina&quot;
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; them.  That paint looks almost right outta the
&gt; &gt; gun...if the paint was that nice I can't see why
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; much other stuff was detailed.
&gt; 
&gt; Just some good polish. Look closer (perhaps not
&gt; visible in the mag
&gt; pictures), and there are stone chips on the front
&gt; panel, the odd small 
&gt; ding - this bus is used!  But, original used. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the tent has been repro'd by the current owner
&gt; (perhaps the one 
&gt; thing the bus didn't come with!) But it's made to a
&gt; correct pattern 
&gt; from an original (cost about 600 pounds sterling I
&gt; think) and does not 
&gt; detract at all. He needs a tent because he uses this
&gt; bus to go camping 
&gt; all over Europe. In fact, it should be at Hannover
&gt; for the 50th 
&gt; Anniversary event.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyhoo...it is a very nice bus!
&gt; 
&gt; It certainly is!!
