&gt; The same number (1121512) is pressed into the sheet metal to the right 
&gt; (passenger side) of the engine.  Between the engine and the battery tray.
&gt; There is no plate on the passenger side of the air vent in the cab.  Not 
&gt; sure if there should be one there or not.


According to &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; your's was built in SEPT/OCT 1963 
timeframe so it is a 1964 model.

&gt; Also, the motor has a number on it as well.  I know it's not original, but
&gt; would like to track down info on that as well.  H5009205 is the number.

Your engine case cast just before 5OCT62 engine # 5 020 751.  So it might 
just be the original engine!
