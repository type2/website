Well just for yucks and grins I'll throw in what I 
did on my first bus, a '64 Deluxe, and add a touch of what I shoulda done refinement.  It's not pure, 
not what one would find in a restoration, it just worked well.

Glued velcro (hook side) at the corner areas of
each window.  With the right material, ya don't even
have to use the pile side velcro, the fabric sticks
to the hook side all by itself.  Slap 'em up, tear
'em down, toss 'em in the wash when needed.  Add a 
little pocket to stash 'em all.  Add a pocket IN
the curtain to hold glasses and such.

I used the same material for a seat cover too, 
come to think of it.

Made one for the Vanagon camper to cover the top
6 inches of the drivers window, since my commute
positioned the sun just behind my left ear, peeking
in behind my glasses.  Velcro needed re-inforcement
after a decade of use, so used a clothes pin to hold
the long velcro piece to the curtain.  Don't have 
that commute anymore, nor the busses either, sigh.

Now you can yuck or grin at my tech tip as your 
pureness affords.

&gt;I just bought a 66 with little clip things (that hold canvas covers on the

&gt;cut to length with end rings to clip over these holding a little tension. PO
&gt;says curtains up or down in seconds, elegant and neat I thought..

&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;Second question.  I'm going to make some curtains and want to find out
&gt;&gt;how they're supposed to be hung.  Rods, or maybe wire?
&gt;
&gt;CUT
&gt;
&gt;&gt;the curtains up with screws with washers large enough to not pass
&gt;&gt;through the rings.  No noticeable loss of visibility and (I think) more
&gt;&gt;elegant a solution than curtain rods.
