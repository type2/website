I bought a pulley ring today, because the notches on the pulley are a joke.
I need help finding TDC, because I think I did it wrong during my initial
valve adjustment a few weeks ago, hence the van not satarting and the timing
being off. The guy at the FLVWAPS said something about putting something in
the spark plug hole and waiting for the piston to come up and stop, then
making a mark, then turning it back the other way, making a mark, and in
between is TDC. I'm completely lost, can someone please clarify, taking into
account I am completely clueless here? Thanks.
