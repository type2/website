&lt;&lt; Should the insulation be sealed off behind a plastic sheet like on the 
front doors? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Plese no!  The front doors are designed to act as a gutter for rain water 
from the slider windows above.  Fiberglass insulation act too much like a 
sponge.  The plasic there in the front doors is to shunt the water from 
sliding down the interior panel and drip out onto the interior cab floor.  We 
would instead for all other body areas suggest the mylar bubble wrap and/or 
the thin sheets of syrofoam from the hardware stores.   Eric&amp;Barb
