I'd like to say these are The Bomb, and you guys know how critical I can be
of repro parts.  I have a set of these in the '60, and another set on ice
for the '54

&gt;I repro'd the internal safari wiper shafts.  These are almost identical

&gt;date have only sold about 250 sets.

&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, are the ones you have the later external repro ones, are
&gt;&gt; you talking about actually rebuilt earlier (internal) ones (65-67 style you
&gt;&gt; need for the buses with the wiper frame assembly, though also usable on the
&gt;&gt; earlier buses)??
