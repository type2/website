Subject: Re: [VB] Removing Speedometer cable from left front wheel

Hi Dave,
There should be a rubber sleeve-like seal to keep water from getting  through 
the innerside hole into the wheel bearings.  You should dig around  with a 
screwdriver a bit to clean off old dried up grease, and still might need  to 
just pull hard.
