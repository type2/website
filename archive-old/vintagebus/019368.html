Ok, the server is back up - BUT!  It's under a serious load
trying to process all of the mail that's backed up trying to get in.  

Please refrain from posting unless it's *really* urgent; yes, we know
there was an earthquake, and some listmembers were in the zone - it can
still wait.  If the pending volume of mail doesn't relent, we'll have to 
dump all of the pending mail in the bit bucket to get our heads above water!

Thanks!

you won't get these informational message any more.  Sorry about that...
