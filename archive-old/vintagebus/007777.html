Hi all
I am a little late into this thread,, but from what I have read,, here is my
thouhgt's

Mark wrote
&gt;Incidently, when trying to get the starter to turn, a voltmeter
&gt;hooked between the + and - battery terminals would read 6V. When
&gt;the starter was turned on (but wasn't working), this dropped to
&gt;next to nothing.  A guy in a electrical shop told me this
&gt;indicates the starter is bad.

I have to disagree with the this,, assuming that the starter motor isn't
completely stuck and won't turn ,,, then a good , fully charged 6 V battery
should not drop below 4.5 volts for at least 1 minute at room temperature,,
now, those are my figures,, I am not sure of the exact data,,
But what I am trying to say, is  *I* think from what you have said,, the
Battery has no Reserve left..bad battery
A lead acid battery has approx 2.4 volts per cell..  that is why a 12 volt
battery is fully charged at 13.8 - 14.4 volts
A 6 volt is the same..2.4v/cell .... it should be 6.9 to 7.2 volts... and
load tested it will not fall much below 5 volts
Road to a solution......
Try and get a charger that has a BOOST output ,, and connect it to the
battery in the Bus,,, and then hit the Key!
If it turns over, it proves the battery has no uumph left in it.
barring that....,, boost the car with a 12 volt battery....YMMV,
If it turns over real fast,, then you know the battery is bad!

Quick story!
I had a friend come by with a headlight out,, which turned out the bulb was
ok,, ,,then I asked why the oil light and generator light didn't come on
when the key was turned on,???,, and come to think about it he says,, he has
had to put 4 batteries in the car in the last 3 months,,!!!
So,, I fiddled with a volt meter for a few minutes,, and nothing was giving
me correct answers,, nothing I did made sense to me!
So I started with the easiest circuit,, the oil pressure light,, This lead
me to find out that the wiring harness had been cut!  By the seat!  ok ok ok
.. it is in a Bug,, but!     strange things happen!

It can be real hard to diagnose the problem if there is a fault that isn't
&quot;normal&quot;
and more difficult to tell a person via type,how to check things out,
Good luck!!  :-)
