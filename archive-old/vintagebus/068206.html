Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

Set a floor jack under the engine and lift it enough to take
the weight, then loosen your other three bolts and wiggle/start the bolt
in there. If you have the insert, then screw it in by hand. TIghten the
lower two bolts first, then tighten up the upper two.
I'd go into my technique of gluing the bolt in there as I do, but what
the hey..
