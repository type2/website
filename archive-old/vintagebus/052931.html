Subject: WCM mis-representation

I am a little angry at WCM. I am redoing my overhead
flap system and I ordered the 211-810 &quot;body seal&quot;, in
there diagram it shows the piece as a
vertical/horizontal/vertical, what I got was a
straight piece of foam core door rubber. My question
is that, was the original seal a 1 piece unit, or was
it 3 pieces. I couldnt find a diagram of it on the
online parts book. Anyone know how much foam core
rubber is a foot? And I also ordered the 211-757 seal
fresh air flap w/14 rivets and it came sans rivets. 
 Mike
