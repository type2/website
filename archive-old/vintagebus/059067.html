Subject: RE: [VB] Broken exhaust studs

I missed UPS yesterday and had to bite my nails until this morning to get
the package from the Time Fastener Company.  Read the instructions which
show the four tools being used in a hand tap wrench.  Very simple operation
really.  I managed to do the two holes in under 30 minutes and the results
are excellent.  Drilling the holes out by hand was interesting and there was
no need to use a power drill.  BTW, I used some high temp locktight on the
inserts and the replacement studs just for good measure.  If anybody in the
bay area ever needs to use this type of kit just send me an e-mail and we'll
get it done.  Thanks to all that offered helpful tips:)

The redrilling of the holes by hand is the hard part.  Use extremely light
to
no pressure pushing the the drill bit into the material.  The drill bit is
going to want to grab into the material especially since it is soft
aluminum.
 If the drill motor is strong enough and geared low enough it will either
break the drill bit or give a good try to break your arms!  The hardest part
is to get the holes straight and that depends highly on how good your hand
eye coordination is and checking often at from two 90 degree points of view!


&gt; Should I use locktight on the insert?

Not needed.  The Time-Sert inserts have a unformed final bottom interior
thread.  When you install it on the inserting tool and seat it the inserting
tool is driven though this unformed area of thread spreading the insert into
place into a press fit.  So you have to form the threads inside the repaired
part for the full length of the insert.  You could use locktight, but in
exhaust areas of great heat we doubt the lock tight will survive long!
