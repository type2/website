My man Everett B related some quotes. Here are a few that I've heard recently...

&quot;What's with you and shifter couplers!?&quot;
&quot;Are you done adjusting those valves YET?&quot;
&quot;Do you need a jump?&quot; &lt;--left my lights on all day at work today &gt;-((( !
&quot;Is your oil, like, clean?~ mine is...&quot;
&quot;52 mph to LA and back? Hahahah my new 911 does that every day in first gear!&quot;
&quot;Are your elbows always black?&quot;
&quot;Do you have to wrench on that thing AGAIN this weekend? When are we going
to move on with our lives?&quot;

and the one that warms my heart...
&quot;Right ****ing on!, is your bus for sale, Brah?&quot; (no!)
