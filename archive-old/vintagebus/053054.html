&gt;Today I put in a mechanical pressure gauge and at start up the pressure was

A little low, if the engine was cold.  I usually see 60 at idle and 70 at 
2500rpm with 20W50 synthetic and a stone cold engine.

&gt;I put in the electric sender and mounted the gauge up front. The
&gt;pressure on the gauge agreed at start up and took for a drive. By the time I
&gt;got to about 200 degrees the pressure was more like 20 psi and at idle of
&gt;around 900 rpm (a guess), down to 4-5 psi, and the light was flickering
&gt;again.

I'm assuming mean your oil temperature was 200 degrees.  Where is your oil 
temp sender mounted?  At what rpm was the pressure 20 psi?  If you don't 
have a tach, then what gear and what speed?

&gt;Flaps was sold out of new oil pressure springs until next week so for grins
&gt;I shimmed them .120 inch and repeated the test drive. I put 40w oil in again
&gt;as I did not want to change two things at once. Same sorry results.

The springs rarely go bad.

&gt;The oil
&gt;pump is new and if it was faulty, would I have great startup pressures?

Not sure, but you *don't* have great startup pressure.  50psi cold is a bit 
low IMO.

&gt;When I rebuilt this puppy everything that could me micced was, and
&gt;plastigauge used where it could be used. I had to trust the machine shop on
&gt;# 3 main as was put on before I got it back from them.

One thing you can do next time is do a visual check on that bearing for any 
obvious play.

&gt;Any more thoughts?

This sounds so much like my experience with rebuilding an 1800 T4 many 
years ago.  I completely rebuilt the motor, plastigaged all the bearings, 
made sure the oil pump was in spec.  Took a drive and saw exactly what you 
did.  Pressure went down to 20 on the freeway (3600rpm) within minutes.  I 
was scared to drive it and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what 
the problem was.  The only thing I could think of was that I must have 
messed up on the bearing clearances so I took the engine back out and tore 
it completely down - split the case and plastigaged the bearings 
again.  Everything checked out.  Put it back together and the pressure 
still went down to 20 when it got hot.  Then I found that my thermostat 
cable was too tight and the cooling flaps weren't opening all the way!  I 
disconnected the cable temporarily and things were somewhat better.  As the 
motor broke in, things got better still although the flickering light at 
idle never went away.

Two things about the flickering light at idle - IN MY OPINION 900rpm is too 
low for our air-cooled motors.  I set my idle to about 11-1200rpm which 
gives a bit more pressure and more cooling air.  Also, if you're using the 
dual VDO oil pressure sender, I've gathered from the list that it comes on 
much earlier than the stock sender (no experience myself as I've used the 
dual sender from day-one, gawd that's 13 years on the same sender!).  Often 
it will start flickering when there is just a smidgen under 10psi showing 
on the gauge.  When this happens, I just let the little light glow.  It 
only takes a couple of psi to keep the engine lubed at idle.

You might be thinking, &quot;but my engine isn't overheating, I only see 200 
degrees oil temp&quot;.  I can't explain that.  I asked where your sender was 
located just in case it was someplace silly like teed into the oil pressure 
sender port, but mine is in the sump (same as dipstick sender location) and 
I still did not see extreme oil temps indicated on the gauge.  Despite 
that, I think heat was the problem.  Partly from the flaps not being all 
the way open, but partly also because the motor is brand new, and brand new 
motors will run a little hotter due to all of the extra friction (rings, 
mostly) before the motor gets broken in.

My advice to you, if you're absolutely certain about the bearings and oil 
pump, is to triple-check your cooling system (flaps, fan, airflow 
obstructions, seals, etc.) and then drive it gently until it is broken 
in.  Change the oil at 50 miles, 300 miles, and 3,000 miles.  At the 3,000 
mile oil change, if the exhaust is clear, blowby is minimal and power is 
good, put in synthetic oil and then just drive it.  That's what I did, and 
if your engine is like mine, your oil pressure will be adequate.  I still 
saw below 25psi on occasion, but those were special occasions like fighting 
30mph headwinds in 100 degree temps in the Mojave desert, or pulling 
3,000ft grades on warm days.  When that happened, I slowed down, geared 
down and backed off the throttle.  My motor survived and yours will too.
