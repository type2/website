Hi Hazetguy,
We just use the same lithium grease we use to lubricate the front beam and 
wheel bearings.  Just remove the forward dust cover and apply only a small 
amount of grease with a screwdriver tip.  Replace dust cover and make sure it 
does not rub when spun.  since we do this regularly when the engine is out we 
have not replaced a throwout bearing in years.  Even when putting an average 
of 20,000 miles on just our 1960 panel camper conversion per year.
