Of course Im just stroking the flame bait. Shawn and I both understand that
at least I was kidding. My reports will be posted to the list as I find time.

It is rare that my wife and I get to take more than an extended weekend for
a vacation. Two weeks was the first time in a decade for both of us. Dont
beat up on the SWUN god &lt;zenor&gt; too badly. In return I will attempt not to
be terribly long in the tooth about the trips.
