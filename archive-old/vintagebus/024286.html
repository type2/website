Hi Mike and Volks,

&gt; 
&gt; I got a pair of Weber ICT 34 (aka 'baby Webers') at a swap meet for real
&gt; cheap.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Will these be enough carb for my 1776cc engine (stock cam, '041'
&gt; heads)?  (or are they complete junk to begin with?)

These are the carbs I'm using on my stock displacement and cam engine.
They certainly aren't junk on that engine. Too little carb is better for
driving around than too much so you'll probably be happy with the way
they run.

&gt; 2.  There is a port on each of the manifolds and the guy I bought them
&gt; from says to connect a rubber hose from one to the other.  Anybody know
&gt; if this is right and if so, what the heck is it's purpose?  And should I
&gt; disconnect it and/or plug it while balancing the carbs?

This tube is to keep things balanced (I've been told). I have a tube
there and my engine runs really smooth. I also T into the line with my
crancase vent. That saves me the trouble of making some sort of
connection at the air cleaner. It also lets both sides burn some of my
oil 8^). I leave the tube connected while tuning the carbs.

&gt; 3.  I've always used a Synchrometer for balancing the dual 40 IDFs on my
&gt; type IV motors and love it.  But on the type I motor, the carbs sit so
&gt; high in the engine compartment (and it doesn't have that great access
&gt; hatch that the 73 and newer buses have) that I can't read it.  Does the
&gt; Unisyn tool work better in this situation?

I have the short manifolds so I don't have that problem, but all I have
is the unisyn and it seems to be good enough.

&gt; 4.  As far as I can tell, when balancing the carbs at a 1200 rpm idle,
&gt; my synchrometer is reading almost off the scale (20+).  At 1200 rpm on
&gt; my dual 40's, I typically see it reading around the 6 or 7 mark.  Is
&gt; this because I'm dealing with 1 throat per 2 cylinders now vs. 1 throat
&gt; per cylinder or am I doing something really wrong?

Sounds good to me. Hey, I thought you couldn't get the synchrometer on
the carbs. Did you add an MX code to your bus?
 
&gt; Sorry for all the questions

Sorry for the answers. Sell me those carbs if you decide you don't like
them. I like mine.
