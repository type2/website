&gt;&gt; Hump in the middle? This is a bench seat right?? No natural hump that I am
&gt;&gt; aware of-anyone else aware of a hump?? Is the hump from bunched up
&gt;&gt; padding/worn padding??
&gt;&gt; 

Everyone pretend that I'm not as ignerent as I sound! I've seen 62 DC's w/o
this hump as well as 60 &amp; 63 DC's so ASSuming that they don't exist is well
ignerent!

I stand corrected, &amp; am waiting breathlessly for a pic of one of these rare
humpback seats to be posted.

Is it related to the rare humpback chub on the endangered species list here
in Utah?
