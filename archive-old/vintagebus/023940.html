Mike,
	RMMW sells new shims to set distributor drive gear end play. I've
spoken with several &quot;mechanics&quot; who have said not to worry about it, but
I prefer correct end play, meself.
	The oil pressure relief/control valves... The pistons were exactly the
same for a number of years. I don't know when they made the relief valve
notched as a standard thing on their engines, but swapping a notched one
for the unnotched one wouldn't hurt, IMHO. I'd use the stock springs in
combination with checking the pressure with a reliable gauge. 
	Your #1 main bearing... your case has had the &quot;thrust&quot; cut on it. If
you can mike the case where the bearing flanges have that free play, I
can find out what the standard thrust is... I miked it on two engines
last week (both with zero thrust cut), and it was something like .850&quot;
or .865&quot; or something similar. If you can find out what it was I'll be
happy to go back and re-mike the cases and get the stock spec for you.
Then you can know how much the thrust has been cut and purchase the
appropriate set of bearings, which will be thicker to account for the
cut in the case. The RMMW catalog has an awesome page of bearings and
their appropriate part numbers, and a list of what's been machined and
where. It was so neat that I just rattled off part numbers to the
VWFLAPS... and it was amazing that he knew what 90% of them were without
having to look them up.
