You know Erin, I am right there with you on this one, as I am seriously
contimplating the sale of my '67 for the same reasons.

A couple of weeks ago I took my '67 to an appraiser to get the necessary
paperwork for my insurance company (it apprasied for just under $6000;
egad!).   He asked me what my restoration plans were for the bus; that's
when the same sinking feelings hit me as well.

18 months ago, I realized I needed a hobby.  When I was a kid in high school
(the stone age if you ask my teenage kids) my friends and I  used to work on
POS cars out of necessity.  I used to enjoy doing it, and decided this is
what I wanted to do to escape from my 'day job' as a geek.  I decided on VWs
because they were relatively easy to work on, didnt need alot of spacialized
tools; finding the '67 with a solid body (in need of serious mechanicals)
finally sent me on this path after a brief stint with a '69 ghia (which is
on its way to the crusher soon if I cant find a buyer).  In the past 10
months I have rebuilt the engine, bearings, brakes and a bunch of other
stuff (electrical, etc; no AM radio _yet_) that I can play with after work
and on the weekends.

I am not a body guy, nor do I really (I think) have serious desires to
become one.  I dont have the skills, space, tools (I tackled the majority of
the engine work with the Muir book, my general mechanical knowledge and a
set of wrenches I received for Christmas on the floor of my garage) and most
importantly TIME to devote to this kind of effort.

I feel the bus (very original with a few rust spots; looks alot like yours
except in blue) deserves a major body overhaul to be preserved for the next
33 years.  I could drop a zillion dollars and turn it over to a body shop,
but that would mean a) I would not have the pleasure of driving it to work
every day (and I smile every time I turn the key)  and b) it would cease
being a hobby and become something that I am throwing money at.

I too dont know how to proceed. All I know is that I am going to drive it
every day (smiles feel pretty darned good) and keep plugging away at
mechanicals.  I guess that if the right price comes around, I'll sell it and
move on to another VW (Things look like alot of fun; a camper is something
else I would like to work on as well).

Oh, and I am playing the lottery every week as well.  I could then quit my
job and move to a double-wide trailer with a 7bay garage located in the
middle of nowhere.  Then I would have time to try body work on the '67 while
driving a Thing to the parts store.

&gt; Tonight I was working on the bus a little bit when stark reality hit home.
&gt; My bus looks like crap.
&gt;
&gt; I've been working hard on a daily basis on my VWs since 1993.  I never
have
&gt; really considered any of my work on my VWs a restoration because it never
&gt; has been.  A true restoration with a bug involves a pan-off and with a
bus,
&gt; you really should strip the shell and go over it completely such as Thom
&gt; Fitzpatrick does.  So I end up with good running VWs but under the surface
&gt; they are rusting away.  Really then, what good is my mechanical work, if I
&gt; don't thoroughly go through a vehicle completely and restore it?
&gt;
&gt; I piddled around tonight and realized that this bus really deserves to be
&gt; stripped down and done right.  It's solid for a Midwest bus but it's got
the
&gt; rocker rust and holes behind the front wheels.  I also attempted to work
on
&gt; one of the popouts in the forward cargo door and stripped out a screw head
&gt; so I just put all the screws back in and called it a night.  I actually
sat
&gt; there in the shop in the chair - totally disgusted with myself for
whatever
&gt; reason.  I realized that I can do the mechanical work on a vehicle well
but
&gt; other than that, I really don't have good restoration skills.  I don't
know
&gt; how to do body work nor can I afford it.  I actually started thinking of
how
&gt; much money I have tied up in this bus and just how cheaply I could afford
to
&gt; sell it.  I simply think I spread my resources too thin.  I've got a
rusted
&gt; out battery tray in Li'l Red, my 74 Super Beetle, that has needed to be
&gt; replaced for 3 years and I've never got around to welding in a
replacement.
&gt; I've got a nasty oil leak due to bad pushrod tubes and shot tranny mounts
&gt; that I've sworn off now for over 2 years on Li'l Red.  Even though it's a
&gt; Super Beater, Li'l Red deserves more attention.
&gt;
&gt; I visited with Mike Carroll in Omaha this past weekend.  He's a great guy
&gt; and has 2 of the most coolest looking dubs you'll ever see.  One is his
&gt; daily driver - a dropped yellow beetle with dual carbs.  Everything about
&gt; that bug is just simply sweet.  I realize that I want a nice looking daily
&gt; driver VW.  After 15 straight months of centering my life around a bus to
&gt; drive, I'm tickled pink to have actually driven one.  They aren't speed
&gt; demons or performance vehicles but it's one of the coolest rides you'll
ever
&gt; drive.
&gt;
&gt; It's kind of dumb to be thinking about selling off this bus as I've worked
&gt; really darn hard to put it on the road but it really irks me to look at
it.
&gt; I see all the flaws such as the torn headliner, the rust spots, the dents,
&gt; the scrapes and it dawns on me - I don't know how to fix it.  I just don't
&gt; know how to keep my bus from rusting away without making it look like crap
&gt; with a pile of POR15 all over.
&gt;
&gt; I fix VWs but I can't restore them because I don't know how.
&gt;
&gt; Before I take such a drastic step, I discussed things with mom as she's
&gt; always got a level head about her and she had a really good suggestion
that
&gt; I'm willing to take a shot at.  She said, &quot;Well your talent is the
&gt; mechanical work.  Surely there is someone on you list who does body work
but
&gt; can't seem to handle mechanical work.  It'd be nice if you could work out
a
&gt; trade.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; So I guess that's what I'm offering.  Is there anyone who'd like to tackle
&gt; the body work on this 67 in exchange for me doing some mechanical work on
&gt; their dub?  Since body work is such an intensive thing I would fully
expect
&gt; that whatever I rebuild be it an engine, front end, (no transmissions),
etc.
&gt; that I would foot the total bill for the parts and labor in exchange for
the
&gt; body work.
&gt;
&gt; It's a shot in the dark but one I'm willing to take before I do the
&gt; unthinkable.
