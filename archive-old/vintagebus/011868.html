&gt;Where is a good place to get a replacement longblock?  Should I opt. 
for
&gt;more horses or just stay with a straight 1600?  This is for the rail, 
as
&gt;the bus doesn't need to be replaced yet(praying).

I dont know where you are so I can't recommend some one close to you, 
but I will say that I really liked my single port 1641. Just a little 
more torque, but not overkill. Some people don't like 1641's however 
because the barrels are thinner, but I had no problem. I like single 
ports in general though because the heads seem to last longer. Here in 
Washington State, I had the work done a few years ago by a guy that had 
been doing VWs for years. I think he has closed shop, which is a shame 
because he was real cool about the work. I had a leaking tranny that he 
replaced a seal (around the shaft, it was an IRS) for $40, which was 
cheap. He also made a flywheel for me when I needed a rare style to 
match my engine and mounted and adjusted endplay for $20 . These people 
are just not around anymore. I hope someone could send you in the 
direction of just such a person where you live, because it is much 
easier to deal with a new engine when you know the builder. My 1641, 
rebuild shortblock, with new doghouse cooler and german bus muffler cost 
$650, including gasket kit for all my bolt on parts and muffler. I don't 
think I am likely to see that price again anytime soon. The bus was 
sold, the engine went many, many hard miles, over mountains and accross 
deserts ( I am friends with the new owner) who travels for a living 
(takes foriegners on &quot;Bus Outings&quot;).

Good luck to all.
Jason
