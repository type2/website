Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] the hubcap?

&gt; Last I heard it was in the Colorado/NM area and that was a year ago or so!
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; hello Guys   Yes where is the hubcap
&gt; 
I was gonna take the hubcap from Big Mike who had it at the last RMMW show 2
years ago +-, &amp; then in the torrential downpour/hail storm spaced it.  I
hope it has made its way out of Colo. Before now?

Tom Buese-where's the hubcap?
