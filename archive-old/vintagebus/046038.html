Hi Matt,
Actually since 57 or 58 depending on Euro or Export models the ground was 
mantained through a pointy bit cast or riveted on the rear of the tail light. 
 This point was to go through a small hole in the rubber tail light to body 
seal.  If the seal is installed the wrong way or if a cheesy aftermarket seal 
without the hole the point does not ground the tail light.  Either way one 
should solder either wire or male slip on fitting to steel bulbholders and 
for potmetal bulb holders one must drill and if enough material is availible 
tapin threads to allow the installation of a screw and nut/s to mount the 
ground wire or male slip on fitting.  Then run ground wires from both tail 
lights to where the battery ground strap mounts to the body.   Eric&amp;Barb
