Subject: Re: [VB] inside the aluminum case from hades

I just hate to see this poor guy get taken advantage of. Here he had to spend all this money to buy
the parts, then had to take it all apart and will have to spend a bunch of money to buy replacement
parts to rebuild it again.

I think that the righteous thing to do would be to replace the entire long block, not just the
defective case and some tools here and there. I mean, it was your part that caused all the
collateral damage wasn't it?

Come on, please don't leave this guy out twisiting in the wind. Just my opinion.

  I sold it to him and have sold 56 of them total before and after Craigs,
he is the only one with a problem and I have helped him with help, advice,
free parts, tool loans and OFFER TO REPLACE with all machineing etc.
  Before you open your mouth KNOW ALL THE FACTS. If the blame is on anybody
it should be ON Rimco, they did the machine work and gave the case, &quot;if that
is the problem&quot; a clean bill of health.
