&lt;&lt; the drivers side only to have it snap off into traffic minutes late 
 _at_!$!%$^$DOH!%!$^^&amp;^!  No biggie I was runnin beetle arms anyway have a set 
 of bus arms but need blades and the nut/bolt that holds the arm to the shaft 
 not the bolt on the spring.  Is there anyway to jerry rig the shaft with 
 welding or something or do I have to score some new wiper linkage?  Any help 
 would be greatly appreciated.

Hey Eric if your WIPER PIVOTS SNAPped off then you gotta replaced them.  THe 
66 you have takes the 66/67 pivots (you are running a 66 wiper motor?) and 
those are being repopped now. WW et al sell them.   You have to remove the 
wiper assembly to installed them, and partially disassebly the wiper 
assembly.  Grease everything!!!!
