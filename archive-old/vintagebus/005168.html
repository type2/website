&gt;  Now, the last NON-working lights, which may be the most important, that I
need to fix are the Oil temp light, GENerator lights, and Speedo light.  The
weather is getting warm and I would HATE to overheat my bus because the OIL
light doesn't work.  Anyway, does anyone have any advice on where I should
start troubleshooting for these lights, or can direct me to a good online
article\procedure for getting these on???

Well, first you need to know that it is a PRESSURE light, not a TEMP light
:))
You turn the key on and nothing, no light, correct? Leave key on. Go to the
sending unit to the left of the dist., disconnect the wire, ground the wire
to the block. Go look at light. Is it on? If yes, replace the sending unit.
Is it not on? Either bulb is dead or the wire from the bulb to the sender is
open.
