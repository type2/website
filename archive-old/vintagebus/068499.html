Subject: Re: [VB] Drunk Driver Convicted

That was Tom Burleson who's family was hit by the drunk driver. The 
original post subject is &quot;horrible news&quot; and it was posted on 8/23/99 if 
you want to go read it.

I still think about that post when I'm driving down the road with my 
family in the bus.

&gt; Some of you may remember a few years ago in Illinois, a family returning
&gt; from Great America in their splitty bus was hit by a drunk driver. Three
&gt; kids, the Mother and the family dog were all killed, only the Father
&gt; survived although he was seriously injured.
&gt; I heard on the news yesterday that the driver who caused the accident has
&gt; finally been convicted and will probably be sentenced to 14 years in prison.
&gt; I believe that the Arizona Bus Club held a fundraiser for this family. I'm
&gt; sorry that I've misplaced the original newspaper article and can't recall
&gt; the names of the family. They were from Crystal Lake Illinois.
&gt; I think a lot of us who've been on the list awhile remember this incident.
