-------------------------------------------------------------------

and that's what I've got. It's a 73 engine. I'm kind of toying with the idea
of buying this bug that I've seen sitting in the mechanics lot which has an
FI engine in it. Mechanic does not know how to work AC engines, admitted to
me myself and poor owner want's to sell non running SB. $500.00 seems too
high. I want to offer $200, see if it sticks and then somehow work the
engine into my bus. Can someone give me some feedback on this?

Thanks for all the help

Andre
