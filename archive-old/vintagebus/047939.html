&lt;&lt; 2nd..
 I took a trip to the body shop the other day (many of them actually) and
 only found one that was willing to work on the bus...and not too far
 away from my home.  Either nobody wants to do any rust repair, or
 everyone is STILL backed up with hail damage... it hailed back in May.
 To fix the rust on the bus (a little in the rockers) and fix all of the
 dents (lower nose, one rear corner, and a couple dings here and there)
 and then respray the bus below the beltline would be about 1200.  To (snip)
  &gt;&gt;

The advice about asking people with buses you think have nice paint jobs is a 
good one.   and about getting the details in writing.  I haven't paid for a 
paint job, did the 65 with help from a couple friends (or vise versa) and 
really it is all in the prep work.  I learned a heckuva lot about body and 
paint  (and colours matching or not) and prep, and can see where it could 
have been better and where it was really a good job, and have ideas about 
what to do better next time.    I didn't think I could make it any worse than 
it was, so it was a good experiment.   But you don't want people learning on 
your bus, about bus metal fitting together, or anything really.

Take the opportunity to be involved in what's going on, and if you have the 
time definately go take things apart, you can polish up the bits while the 
bodywork is going on.   Nice shiny dash switch faces in the dash- little 
touches really make the whole thing.
