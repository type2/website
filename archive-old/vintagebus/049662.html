Subject: Re: [VB] Pennies under the floor

&gt;I was cleaning out a '64 double cab I had purchased about 4 years ago from a
&gt;VW shop in Reno, NV.  Underneath the front seat I found an old looking penny
&gt;roll paper\

&gt;&gt; When I pulled the interior out my new 65 EZ Camper, I found a pint glass
&gt;&gt; full of change

I pulled the interior panels outa the 70 a few years back - found a VERY
brown ounce !
The 65 s/c has been  boring in contrast... $1.12 in change and a vise grip.

The 50 Chevy 1/2 ton has been the most interesting: half a 70-era Playboy
and some .45 bullets :O
