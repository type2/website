Subject: RE: [VB] Re:Old Car Scrappage Alert

Please keep in mind that I did NOT write this email, but am simply passing it along.

If you don't like what I passed on, that's OK.  If you do like it, that's fine, too.

It was simply info that passed by my way.  I felt the entire message had enough useful info to
pass along to this list.  I do understand it's accuracy is not entirely precise.

I have recieved some private mail addressing this issue from someone who took the entirity of the
original letter out of context.  While I don't neccessarily appreciate what that person wrote, I
need not respond to that individual personally.  I simply want to point out the above facts.

If anyone else, for some strange reason, wants to p-mail me about this (or anything) they are more
than welcome to.  All I ask is that you don't literally cuss me out for your opinion on the
matter.  I can appreciate anyone's input, so long as it remains less than profane.

Happy bussing,
T (GoodOleVolk_at_yahoo_dot_com)

&gt; While there isn't specific bus content in this thread, it is something
&gt; that is potentially VERY important to all of us as automobile collectors
&gt; &amp; enthusiasts. I have read the bill and passed my comments on to
&gt; enthusiasts in other fields that will be similarly concerned about this.
&gt; I would not have know about it if Bill had not cross-posted to the list.
