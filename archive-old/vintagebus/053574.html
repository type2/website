&lt;&lt; I bought a German bug exhaust with two pea shooters that I thought would
 fit. It cleared the rear apron, but the bumper will not fit back on. Cwis
 Slaymaker had a tube that connected the two outlets into one tail pipe.
 Would this solve this problem? It seems I have seen the bug exhaust work for
 others. Is it a 1969 thing? &gt;&gt;

Ric,

A Bug exhaust is NOT a good thing on a bus.  It dumps your exhaust gas into a 
dead air pocket immediately behind the rear hatches that follows your bus 
around at highway speeds (because of its shape UN-aerodynamic shape).

It circulates around in that space until it creeps into your bus around the 
rubber seal on your rear hatch or gets blown in through your fan and heat 
exchangers.

Check out where ALL bus and vanagon exhaust pipes exit......its off to the 
SIDE of the vehicle, near the &quot;slipstream&quot; so that the exhaust gases are 
blown well away from the back side of the vehicle.  Bugs and ghias were 
aerodynamic enough that air flowed_down_across the back of the vehicle and 
away to the rear, thats why the twin pea-shooters work with that body shape.
