My 57 standard has all five crows foot rims dated correctly for the bus.
They had the green/green paint on them still.
I believe they were just two manufacturers.......
And both styles were made form 55-64....there is no early or late I believe.

&lt;&lt;It has always been my understanding that the crows feet rims were for

trucks, the non crow's feet for buses. No proof I guess, just what I heard.
