Subject: 6 volt solenoids

This might be of more interest to those of us in the frozen north, but I was
also unable to find any listings for a 6 volt starter solenoid on any of our
esteemed list venders.

Called Bow wow who's supposedly the NW's solution to VW parts and was
greeted with a geez, you need one of those. Apparently they only list one
part # for 64 thru 78 which we know will be 12volt. Long story short, local
shop can supply them or rebuild them if not too damaged.
Wasn't too bad a price $37.50 can which would be what? like 5 bucks us.
