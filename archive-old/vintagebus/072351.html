Hi Greg,
Sounds like you might want to drain the old engine oil (Put new oil bottles 
in driver seat to remind yourself that you have to fill the engine before you 
try to start it!), take the engine out this weekend and tear it down to a 
long block and give all the cooling fins a good cleaning and if need be a 
sawing or filing the fins open.  If the engine is really greasy, a degreasing 
and spray down at your local wash rack.  Retorque all the head and engine 
case fasteners and replace oil cooler seals and FW seal.  Also completely 
clean the carb out and check your jetting.  Check fuel pump rod for proper 
hieght, if it is too high your fuel pressure will be too high and fuel will 
be dumped into the engine.  While the engine is out replace all flex fuel 
lines, check and R&amp;R if need be axle boots, throwout bearing, starter bushing 
and change the gear oil in the tranny and RGBs.
  Once you have the engine back together and in your bus drive around town 
for the next 300 miles for trips no longer than 30 minutes at a time and let 
it sit for at least 15 minutes between trips to cool off.  Change oil about 
every 50 miles during this period while your engine is breaking back in from 
not being run much before.  Buy or borrow a tach to see where you hit 1,500 &amp; 
3,000RPM in each forward gear. 
  There is lots more you need to do to the brakes, supension so get a Bentley 
reprint of the VW transporter shop manual!
