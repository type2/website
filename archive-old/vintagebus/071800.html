Subject: Re: [VB] swap sunroof parts from bug to bus?

&lt;&lt; My 64 21 came with no sunroof handle and all the splines stripped off where
 it attaches from years of vice grips rounding it out. I know of a local rag
 top beetle that could be had cheap and I'm wondering if that whole latch bit
 might be the same as a bus?
  &gt;&gt;

the 63 and earlier bus es use the same sunroof handle as a bug, and that bug 
handle can also fit on a 64-67.   I suggest cross referencing parts lists on 
the other parts.   I dont think they fit though, rails diff sahpe, cross pieces 
wider on a bus.  But do check.
