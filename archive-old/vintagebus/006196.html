i ran an ad for the new deluxe i'm picking up tuesday
being i'm a commercial type of guy, and this bus is to nice
for me and more worthy of the resto perfecto guys
i will probaly sell it (just wanted to see the interest if i ran an ad)
it is a 1 owner 65 hardtop deluxe
has been parked since 1977
when the engine developed a rod knock!!!!
according to the owner the engine has never been removed!!!
it is complete, govener and all
it's a shame as the middle seat 1 piece of deluxe trim
2 pop-outs and a couple of other small items have been stolen
off of it since it has been parked, weird but the radio knobs are there
horn button, clock etc, all mint, the headliner is as new as are the front
and rear floor mats, even the seat clamps are there, bumpers and all

the reason for this post is i'm shocked at the amount of out of country
people are contacting me for this bus (o yes original paint), i've ran ads
for a lot of my buses and never this much interest, now i know why dougless
doesn't need to take buses he does to shows, 1 out of country guy called and
told me
he has exported over 100 buses in the last year or so ( i see the porsche
trend
happening here ) and so there is a great interest out of this country, more
then i
ever knew!!! even had to download a japanese translator for some of the
inquires!

this one should stay in this country!!!!
