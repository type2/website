What negative things have you/he heard about rebuilt steering boxes?

The problem with trying to find a &quot;tight&quot; one is that you can't really
tell if it's &quot;tight&quot; until you drive it.

I have a rebuilt one in my '60, and it's been fine.

Secondly, is it really the steering box that's the issue in his bus?

I think all of the 3/55 - 7/67 boxes are all the same.

&gt; things about the rebuilt ones, so he would like an original one out of a low 
&gt; mile rusted/hit bus that is being parted out. Any leads? If anyone on the list 
&gt; has had good experiences with rebuilt ones, please let me know as well.  Last 
&gt; but not least, what years were the steering boxes the same as 64??  I 
&gt; appreciate any help from the list.  Thanks, Drew.
