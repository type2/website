&gt;We've been trying for an hour to pull a tranny out of a '78 bus.  We followed
&gt;the Bently procedure and removed the square head screw from the shift rod.
&gt;Why won't the shift break free of the input shaft of the transmission?  It
&gt;appears that there may be some rust where the two units join. We've used PB
&gt;blaster and a hammer but can't get them apart. The tranny is level and 
&gt;lined up
&gt;(again).
&gt;
&gt;Advice needed!

Patience, my friend.  Spray the blaster, tap it with a hammer (lightly!) 
Don't beat on it...you just want to set up a little vibration to jiggle the 
blaster into the joint.  Go off and do something else for thirty minutes or 
an hour.  Then repeat the process.  Two or three times.  Then give it a 
good blast, and forget about it until tomorrow.

The next morning, give it a good blast and tap...wait a few minutes and fry 
to pry/jiggle/vibrate it loose.

You could heat it with a torch, but you would probably set your bus afire. 
- not a good thing.  Maybe one of those halogen work lights that are so 
hot, but maybe not.


Or, you could take out the bolt holding the square rubber pads and pull the 
tranny with the coupling attached...........
