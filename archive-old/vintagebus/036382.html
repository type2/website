Subject: Re:  Jerome Jamboree - best airport?
Message-ID: &lt;7mipta$redg_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

 joe, save yourself some dough &amp; fly direct to sky harbor airport in
phoenix az. i sure there are people from the ABC you can caravan up
with + it's more fun that way. if you fly into flagstaff, you'll still
have to get a connection from phoenix. see you at jerome...terry delaney

&gt; After hearing so much about past Jerome Jamborees I'm considering
flying
&gt; out to this year's (Sept 11-12, right?) event.  My knowledge of AZ is
&gt; pretty slim, but looking at MapQuest it appears that Flagstaff is the
&gt; closest good-sized city.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone care to recommend airports/cities they've flown to for the
event
&gt; in the past?  I'll be coming from Florida, if that's of any
consequence.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; joe
