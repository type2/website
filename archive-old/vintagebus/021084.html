Subject: Re: [VB] steering

&gt; &gt;I have been asked many times and never had the
&gt; answer to what went
&gt; &gt;around the steering column at the floor.  [Found on
&gt; 15-window Deluxe:]
&gt; &gt;Mind you it wasn't a grommet like bugs have but a
&gt; flat piece of rubber
&gt; &gt;fitted around the column sealing the gap between
&gt; the column and the
&gt; &gt;floor, held in place by the floor mat.

Never saw one before, but I was getting my Grateful
Dead bus together today, and it has one too!  However,
it was cracked badly.  Ronnie, are you going to start
carrying these?
