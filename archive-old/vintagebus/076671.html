Subject: 6V to 12V

I am reluctantly converting my 99% original 65 21 window deluxe from 6V to
12 V because I'd rather drive her than let her sit. Long story...

Anyway Does anyone have a parts list of what will be needed? Part numbers in
particular so I can order it...

I found the tech article on vintagebus_dot_com but I need more info than that
provides.  And trying to find anything in the archives is not as easy as it
used to be.

I have emailed several distributors hoping to find a kit but so far none
seems to be available.

I did find this and was wondering if anyone had used it and the pros/cons of
it. Wiper motor voltage reducer

Thanks in advance for any assistance..
