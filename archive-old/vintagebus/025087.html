Well, thanks to Clara and Eric and Barb for recommending i change my
transmission oil.  Wow, was that stuff cruddy.  I had quite a bit of
trouble finding a 17 mm allen wrench, so i sort of fashoned one out of a
10 mm bolt, the bolt head was a little too much smaller than the 17mm,
but the nuts that I screwed onto the bolt fit into those plugs perfectly
with almost no chance of stripping.  I still think tho that I should
look at my rear bearings.  But when i did the push pull test i really
dont think that there was any play in those rear wheels at all.  hmmmm -
it is kinda hard being sure of what you hear when you are  driving the
shell of a bus.  There is still a howl, but, ......

Well, my current problem is a certain stiffness in the clutch cable.  I
spoke to a guy today and he told me that the clutch cable housing can
deteriorate inside and that you can be left with the cable riding on the
bare steel of the cable housing and that this can lead to clutch cable
breakage.  Is this all true?  My clutch does seem to work fine but for
this sort of grabbing.  Is replacing the cable housing a common
necessity?

thanks again
