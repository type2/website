Subject: Engine Number?/VIN problem

While reading David's engine number question, I thought of something that
might help me out a great deal.

The situation: My &quot;Certificate of Title&quot; states the VIN to my '63 as being
7024040.  The VIN on my bus is accually something far different (988295).

The big question: Does 702040 sound like an engine number?

The problem: Before this situation erupted, the existing engine from the
freshly purchased bus was scrapped and a new engine built. Have no way of
knowing if this number was on the engine....or possibly on an engine before
that.

The rest of the story: I went to the DMV in Feb. to register my bus. Upon
vehicle inspection, the inspector could not find in any way, the number
&quot;7024040&quot; on my bus.  The title info seems to match up to the rest of the
bus just fine.  Of course this still does me no good. The numbers do not
match.

The other question: Is it possible that whoever registered the bus prior to
me, registered the bus using the engine number? Or does 7024040 not follow
along the lines to a number that could be on a bus? Is the title bogus? I
don't know what to do. Is there an easy way out? I hope I that wasn't too
confusing. :)

TIA
