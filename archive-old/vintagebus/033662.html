Subject: RE: [VB] Use of '68-70 brake parts on a splitty

   You don't need anything except a special axle seal. With the
unavailabilty of new pre 68 front drums, the later ones are all that are
avaiable. Once in a blue moon I do find some pre 68 drums but not very
often.

   So all you need to find are the front axle seals and they will work just
fine,

Hey All, 

  I picked up a decent set of front brake drums a couple weeks ago and I was
wanting to use them on my bus!

  Here is my problem:

  The drums are '68-70 bus and I have a '67 bus!

  I was told that some sort of spacer is required.  Does anyone know what I
am talking about, where exactly I am supposed to put the spacer  AND where I
can get that spacer?

ALSO, what is the compatibility of backing plates from a '68-70 to a
splitty?

THANKS
