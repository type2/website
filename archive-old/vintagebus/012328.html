Could you expand on this?  I thought that building an engine up from
parts would be a _lot_ more expensive than buying a long-block, what
with the higher price of individual parts and less-efficient labor.

Or are you saying that they import factory long-blocks and then add
the parts to make them turn-keys?

What are the differences between the FI long blocks and the carb long
blocks?
