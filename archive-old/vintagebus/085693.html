Subject: 6 Volt Devon Light

So ... I have a light from a 62 Devon Caravette. It is 6-volt and takes a 
12&quot; fluorescent tube - 8 watts. I want to put this light in my 60 that has 
been upgraded (maybe just graded) to 12 volt. I'm still running my 6 volt 
wiper motor with a voltage drop thingy - I suppose I could just do that 
here - that is, put a voltage drop thing between the battery and the power 
for this light.  But ... I'm wondering - what about this florescent tube? 
What happens with the ballast? Would the tube that is in this work in a 110 
volt fixture - or - would it have to be a 6 volt fixture.  Would I even need 
a voltage drop thing?

How bout ... the 70's westies with fluorescent lights - where do the 
ballasts for those go - I wonder if I might just get a fluorescent light and 
wire it to this early 60's fixture? How long is a 70's westy fluorescent 
tube? Are they really skinny?
