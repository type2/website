&gt; Where is the M-code plate located on a 60 DD Panel ?

Right behind the passenger side of the front seat

&gt; Can a rear seat ( and belts ) be installed and not devalue
&gt; the $20k spent on new paint / engine ? ( no T-bolt plates
&gt; on the floor ).

Depends on who your &quot;target customer&quot; us.  I say put the seats in,
and when you're not using the seats, use the &quot;blank&quot; panel floor
mat, which doesn't have the seat holes - nobody would know.

&gt; Same for gauges- it has only a spedo. I assume these
&gt; could be clamped to the bottom of the dash with no holes.
&gt; What brand gauges would look good ?

Are we going for a show look or functionality?  One popular
method is to take a spare overhead console closing plate
and putting the guages in that.  It's easy to read, and if
you wanna go back to OG, pop the other plate back in.
