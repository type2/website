I have never had a VW engine in Phoenix that could be
checked by using the supposed &quot;finger tip test&quot;. I
always have to use a lot of gas station towels to
insulate fingers when checking oil. I always figured
that the finger tip heat test as discussed on the list
was similar to the stories that I read in Reader's
Digest Magazine as a boy growing up in Phoenix about
kids playing in the piles of Maple leaves in Fall and
rejoicing at the first snow fall of Winter. Basically
stuff in AZ is one of two temps, hot and hotter than
the other temp.
