hey all,
i have been keeping an eye out for parts and cant really seem to come up 
with much... so ill ask the experts. i have some time on my hands 
considering my engine is getting rebuilt and its still 35 and snowy here. 
(its was actually 66 degrees today! but snow will be on the ground when i 
wake up tomorrow) anyway, the metal strip that holds the adjusting star in 
place is the part in question here. only one of four corners of my bus has 
them. what happens to them? do they break? fall off? it is VERY frustrating 
to have to adjust them every other week cuz they (shoes) keep backing off. 
last time i had the wheels off i didnt really check them out to see if you 
can just put some new ones in. anyone??

thanks,
