Subject: Re: [VB] Heat riser repair

&gt; On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right
&gt; at the bend. I have tried many different &quot;high heat&quot; exhaust repairs,
&gt; but as of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days. Has anyone
&gt; else been able to repair this piece? I found plenty of articles in the
&gt; archives about cleaning out a blocked tube, but didn't stumble across
&gt; any repair questions.

I use a small hose clamp over a bit of tin cut from a tin can.  A thin
film of red silicone sealant seals it up.

On this topic, any ideas for a permanent fix?  I fear that the heat risers
on my '71 won't hold together much longer!  They don't seem to be
replacable and new manifolds don't seem to be in the offing.
