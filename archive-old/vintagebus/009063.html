Subject: [VB] brake question

ok my back left brake is sticking and getting real hot,and the right but not
as much,  and i think it is the source of this wa wa wa wa revolution type
sound that im hearing ,   i t has a new cylinder and rubber hose , both back
brakes do, i have disconected the short line from the t and the one from the
cylinder to the rubber hose, and they both passed the blow through test,
while they were off i had my wife press the pedal a few times and brake
fluid squirted out of the t quite nicely,   i can release the brake pressure
with either the left or right bleeder valves, and it releases at the master
cylinder when i loosen the rear line, but it still sticks,   any
suggestions, before i waste anymore brake fluid?
