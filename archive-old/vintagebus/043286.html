I like.  Anyone have pix?  Doubt I'll ever have safaris on this one, but I
am paranoid about my emblem &lt;cough&gt;.

&gt; * up the windshield pillar - I think this is the slickest setup, but
&gt; it requires an antenna with an extra support post for the roof.

Sounds like the setup I've seen on vintage beetles - and I agree: very
slick and retro.  Again, pix?  Sounds like the emblem mount, just higher?

&gt; I've also seen a factory lit piece of a bus with the antenna mounted by the 
&gt; left  rear taillight.

That's where my 102&quot; stainless CB whip goes, man.  Seriously, that would
mean some long-ass antenna cable.  I wonder why they'd put it there --
although if CB memory serves, that puts the best reception forward of the
bus.  Great for picking up the home radio stations on the way back from a
long trip. :-)

Thanks,
Joe
