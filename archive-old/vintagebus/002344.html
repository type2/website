Hi Everyone,

    Just wanted to let you all know that I finally finished my engine
build/re-build pages.  Here's the URL:
http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/engine_build.htm

    Nothing flashy, it just basically chronicles the build-up of my 1776cc
engine which now resides happily in my bus.  I'm happy to report that the
engine and owner (me) are doing well and are still friends :-)

    It's geared toward the home builder with all, but the usual machine
work, done in-home.  I hope it's of use to someone out there who's new to
VWs.

    HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!  ANDPLEASE BE CAREFUL DRIVING THIS WEEKEND!!!
