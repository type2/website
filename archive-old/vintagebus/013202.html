The first prototype buses were made in '49.  Production started in
(I think March of) '50.  

The prototypes had the external gas filler and vertical vents.  
There were other prototype-only features as well, such as raised
headlight buckets, the top front door hinge below the beltline,
amongst others.  

The prototypes, as well as the first group of production buses, 
had the stand-up spare tire configuration.

There has been a 1950 bus for sale for a while in SO Cal, but
it's missing a lot of stuff that you will never find, like the
cast-aluminum front and reat emblems, which do not have a connection
between the V and the W.

1954 models had 36hp engines with the single-strap mushroom air 
cleaners.

Deluxes thru '54 had plexiglas (that's how it's spelled on the window!)
corner windows;  Deluxes thru '53 had plexi roof windows as well.  Deluxes 
thru '52 had recessed roof windows.

&gt; were being made then.  I'm not mistaken about the year.
