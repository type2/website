&gt; This is a question that has bothered me for quite some time now. Why
&gt; do oil pressures get up to 80 pounds when the oil pressure relief
&gt; valve is designed to relieve at much lower pressure, what is it, 30
&gt; pounds or so?
&gt; 

hello John  I think this is only on dual relief cases.   single relief cases 
will have higher oil pressure sometimes too high which is why they started to 
make the dual cases in 1970 in the cases that started with the B sufix .  
later and have fun  Mark dearing
