&gt; Its good to be a bus pilot some days...
&gt;

Thanks, Stephen for the upbeat message. My trip to work takes me across about
15 miles of county roads, many days the cows, pigs and horses, and more than a
few tractor pilots have been &quot;treated&quot; to my renditions of  &quot;Midnight Train to
Georgia&quot;, &quot;Don't Rock the Boat&quot; and other R&amp;B hits from the 70's. &quot;Everyday
People&quot; used to be a favorite until Toyota bought it.
Since it's practically friday, I'd like to hear what other bus guys and gals
croon on their various errands.
