To clarify things a little more about what they wanted in a bus for the photo 
shoot...

A few months back, Playboy called me looking for a bus to use in this shoot, 
since it was to be in Daytona Beach which isnt really far from where I am.  
They asked what I had and I told em about my truck and camper.  They were 
interested, but then  started saying they wanted stick flowers and junk all 
over it, and they needed it for a week.  The last thing I wanted was one of 
my buses in some dudes hands for week.  I cant imagine it would have been 
treated well.  I explained that my buses are more vintage looking and the 
camper is really lacking in the shiny department.  They were more interested 
in something &quot;groovy&quot; then what I had to offer.  The thought of either one of 
my buses plastered up with flowers makes me ill, so I am glad it didnt work 
out.  I gave some people the phone number to call to try and get their bus in 
there, but I am not sure what came of it.  I guess the whole point of this 
would be to explain what they wanted in a bus and to say that the bus didn 
start out with a bunch of flowers and crap on it, they were added by the fine 
folks at PB.
