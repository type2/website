&gt;OK, how do you get a tie rod end out.  I removed the entire right or
&gt;passenger
&gt;rod and both ends from the bus, but I can't get either end to budge.  I've
&gt;been using wd40 and am now trying heat.  When I clamp it down in the vise and
&gt;turn the end the rod wants to twist....  Any ideas?  For a '66

Need a new one?  Remember, rust never sleeps...

&gt;Here's another ?, Is the outer tie rod end passenger side left or right
&gt;threaded?  Which way should I turn it.  I think these are the original ones
&gt;from the factory...

One end is RHT, other end is LHT - that way you can adjust toe-in with the 
rod in place by loosening the clamps and twisting the rod.
