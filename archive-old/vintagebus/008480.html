Maybe I'm stupid but I have found that the 2 most encountered problems with
bus turn signals as been the fault of a dirty/worn Turn Signal switch and
bad contacts in the relay box.  It seems when I took the TS switch off the
bus, bathed it in electrical contact cleaner, and blasted it with compressed
air, everything magically worked.  Of course, the relay boxes were both
replaced with Kymco's flasher relay conversion.

Damn - if they're going out of business, I better stock up on those
replacement relay boxes so I have a few around for future projects.
