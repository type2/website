Subject: My new find

Hey All,
    If some of you remember a few years back, Discover Card purchased two
low mileage buses and had them painted by the Jerry Garcia Foundation to
then be given away via a sweepstake.Well, I received a call the other day
from a friend telling me they were for sale locally, so I dropped everything
I was doing and went and had  a look at them.Well, I bought them on the
spot.
    One is a 59 microbus with 22,000 original miles(still has the 40 horse
bastard motor)
and the other is a 65 21 window with 62,000 original miles.Both have  WILD
graphic paint jobs from bumper to bumper  and are &quot;signed&quot; by Jerry.
    The reason I'm posting this to the list is, I'm trying to find out the
origins of the 65 deluxe.I know the 59 came out of Pennsylvania and was
mango green and sea gull grey and many people were disappointed that
Discover took such an original, cheery bus to use for the graphic paint
job.The 65, I was told, was once owned by Jerry Garcia.But I'm unsure of
this. Does anyone out there know who owned this bus before Discover card
bought it ?? There is a Missouri Vehicle sticker on the Drivers windshield.
I would appreciate any info. !
I'll have pics up soon.

THANKS,


                 woody
         &quot;keep on pushin'''
