Air-Cooled Fan Drive:  Can you imagine what it would be like to sweat out
these hot and humid Missouri summers without being air-cooled?  We can.
That is why we are teaming up with OACAC this summer to supply fans to the
needy.  We are asking you to help us.  Please gather any old fans or, if
you wish, buy a new fan and bring them to the June Bug Jamboree.  All
contributors will be added to a drawing for a color TV or radio.  So
remember, when you come to the June Bug Jamboree, bring your old fans --
it's for a good cause.
