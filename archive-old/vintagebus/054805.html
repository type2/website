Subject: Members in Atlanta area coming out west?

Greetings all,

I recently purchased a *large* Coca-Cola cooler from a guy in Atlanta
for a song. Unfortunately, he will not ship and has asked that I have it
picked up. On the off chance that there are members in that area that
might be travelling out toward Cali, I wanted to see if there was a
chance I could &quot;hitch a lift&quot;. Halfway is fine too, I just want to get
it moving from where it's at now.

Many thanks to anyone that can help,

~Rich Barker
