Hey All:

Well, I finally have them finished, ready for production. 

Sam Williams (Sglw_at_aol_dot_com) is helping me out by setting up a webpage with a few pics so that everyone can view it.  This should be ready by Monday.  In the meantime, or for those without Internet access, pmail me and I can send you the pics as an attachment.

I just dumped a 20 oz. Coke on my lap and floormat last night FOR THE LAST TIME!

Anyway, I hope you guys like them.  They're nothing too fancy, but seem to fit with a bus and they definitely work, and they inexpensive.  $12.00 plus shipping.  Colors are black, red and kick panel grey.  Maybe more colors down the road if people actually like them.  Time will tell.

Robert
