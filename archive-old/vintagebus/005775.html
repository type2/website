Hi everyone. I've been off list for a while, I've been finishing-up the
restoration on my '71 Type 3. It's 99% complete and I'm turning my attention
back to my '65 crew cab that Dave Easterwood found for me here in Atlanta.

My current challenge is to replace the inner and outer rockers on both
sides. I was getting sheet metal from someone up in MA or CN that was a
distributor for Alan Schoenfield in England. I think he had just gone out of
business and I was wondering if anybody knew if someone else picked-up the
distributorship for Alan's products.
