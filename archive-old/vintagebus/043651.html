Penguins are everywhere!

&gt;I am *not* putting Japanese bearings on 
&gt;my bus, unless it really is the only choice.

Here's a note on bearings...about a month ago I put all four new 
bearings on a single-axle 4x8 flatbed trailer.  The trailer and
the axle were both made in the USA.  The four original bearings
I pulled off were etched &quot;SLOVAKIA&quot;.  I am not making this up.

In my quest to find the correct replacement bearings, I found
some SKF ones made in Mexico and Timken ones make in the USA.
I finally found the right bearings and bought four Timken
bearings - same part number.  When I opened the boxes, two
were made in the USA and two were made in Brazil.

With good quality control, and a reputable supplier, the country
of origin &quot;shouldn't&quot; matter.  Still, I put the USA bearings on
the inboard side, figuring they would see more load.  :)

&gt;If I knew how to punch a square hole, I could modify a passenger
&gt;side cap.

Drill it and use a small triangle file to make it square.  It's
a job but eminently doable.
