Subject: RGB's/Threads/Bolts

Hey gang,

Finally got my wheels of the new2me '65.

After the DPO put on the incorrect, but brand new passenger tires, he had the shopmonkey airwrench the lugs on.

Took me a 1 1/2&quot; x 6' cheater pipe on the tire iron to break torque.

I had two lug bolts with flattened threads come out.

questions:

What is the correct torque spec when I put the wheels back on? (will get bentley when I'm a little more fluid, now valves and oil changes must suffice)

Is is likely that the drums' threads are damamged like the bolts? what to do?

Are the RGB's supposed to sag (camber direction) when the back of the bus is on jackstands?

thanks and have a great weekend,

Billy
