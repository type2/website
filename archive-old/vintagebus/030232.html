Subject: Re: Coat Hooks

Thom:  It was with great reluctance that Bessie our Hippy bus gave up those barndoor coat
hooks
for you.--I'll have to check her out for more stuff she may have in her stash--seeing as i
need a set of tailights for my 51 barndoor--But the last time i looked Bessie was wearing
a set of later style NOS ambulance taillights--enjoy---I know they are now in a Vantastic
home--TWWM, uj
