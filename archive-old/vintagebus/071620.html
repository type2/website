Subject: Re: [VB] What the heck? (pushrod/rocker arm)

----- Original Message -----

&gt; Started the bus this morning for it's warm-up and it backfired but
started.
&gt; Thought it was odd.  When I started driving, no power, vibrating above 2k
&gt; rpms, got to my destination, went to work, when I got back started poking
&gt; around, found a wet #3 plug, wires looked good, pulled the valve cover and
&gt; voila, looking at the end of a pushrod.  It was the inboard rocker on #3.
&gt; Which is that, intake or exhaust?
&gt;

How high do you normally rev the motor? Stock springs on the new 043 heads
are only good to about 4500rpm (you can push the spring down by hand). If
you rev higher than that, the pushrod can come out of its 'cup', and do as
you explained. You can easily swap the springs out for a set of HD singles
to help prevent this in the future if you want with the engine installed.
