Subject: Re: Speedo and lic plate light

&gt;
&gt; I had a light bulb and socket missing at the bright headlight indicator
&gt; in the rear of the speedo That is a hot wire, right?

Right.  The blue wire is a hot wire that is on whenever the high beams
are on.  This bulb grounds through the outside sleeve of the socket to
the speedometer housing.

&gt; Also the license plate light burns the fuse. In the diagram there is
&gt; only one wire, but when I was cleaning out the old wires there were
&gt; two. Do I have to use a ground wire?

You don't strictly have to.  The license light will ground itself
through the lid and hinges back to the body, but it might not be as
bright or steady as it could be.  On my '64, the ground wire is just
a short jumper to a sheet metal screw in the jamb of the engine lid -
it doesn't go into the harness.

&gt; I cleaned up the recepticle and made sure that the insulator isolated
&gt; the bulb wire, but it still blows the fuse.

Just for grins, have you tried another bulb?  Even a 12 V one will work
for testing purposes.
