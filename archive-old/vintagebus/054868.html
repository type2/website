tubes that are spring loaded? &gt;&gt;

The problem with spring or threaded push rods is that the two tube halves 
with one side inside the other tends to insulate the hot oil coming out of 
the lifter through the push rods and through the rocker arms and splattering 
over the surfaces of the hot heads.  On the return path to the sump the stock 
push rods allow this oil to cool somewhat.  Eric&amp;Barb
