Subject: best way to ship my bus?

List-
I know the subjects comes up every so often, but i haven't paid much 
attention to shipping topics. But now i am in need of some information. My 
dad has been bus sitting for me in Seattle, but i really miss my bus and my 
wife and I need the extra car now. Unfortunately i can't get the time off 
work to drive the bus here myself. So i need to know the safest and most 
cost efficient way to ship my bus from seattle to chicago. So far the 
cheapest transport i can find is about a thousand dollars. Any ideas would 
be more than welcomed.
thank you list.
you have saved me too many times to count.
