Definitely check the rod at both ends.  It wouldn't hurt to do them
all, on general principles.  From what I remember of your previous
posts, it sounded at least partly like a loose rod.  I've got a really
chewed-up piston sitting on a shelf to remind me that mild tapping
noises can be a big ogre knocking, trying to get out....
