Absolutely nothing.  Americans don't seem to get worked up over much
more than trees and legalizing pot anymore.  The guv-mint could start
stamping our ID and religion on our foreheads, and people would say 
&quot;OK, as long as I can still go to the mall...&quot;

I realize we have cheeper gas than the Europeans, but the oil companies
are trying very hard to make up the difference.
