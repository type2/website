Well yes and no.  The overflow tubed tank uses a non-vented cap and relies on 
the tube to keep the tank from being pressurized or being vaccumed.  The bus 
tank has to use a vented cap to prevent this from stalling out the engine 
and/or damaging the tank from flexing itself to death since it's drain tube 
in the bus body does not prevent overflow or tank pressure problems.  
While the net effect is the same it is kind of like the differance between a 
tricycle or bicycle or between a lathe or milling machine.  Just try to enter 
a tricycle in a competition bicycle race or mill a crankshaft out of billet 
material.
 
&lt;&lt; Probably.  I always let the pump's auto-shutoff decide where &quot;full&quot; is.  I 
also don't put the nozzle in all the way, mainly because then the 
auto-shutoff triggers immediately, no matter how much is in the tank.  The 
result is a pretty consistent level (and corresponding mileage calculations), 
which I can see after removing the nozzle.&gt;&gt;
Out this way they have these fancy anti-vapor pumps which will not allow 
pumping to begin unless you have the nozzel all the way in!  Plus often pumps 
will only pump fuel at warp speed which shuts off the fuel flow way before 
the tank is really full and/or the auto shut off either has a hair trigger or 
hardly works.  We also like to fill it just so you can see the fuel thru the 
neck.  Not all the way up to the cap unless we are on a road trip and are 
immeadiately getting on back on the highway.
