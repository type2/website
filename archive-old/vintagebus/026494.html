I have to second this.  I was totally burned out on a full resto of a 65 pop
top Westy.  When I purchased a rusted out hard top Westy with a good
interior.  I only got it for the inside, but when I got it home and put it
back on the road, it gave me a real boost just to be driving a splitty.  Even
though it has a f'd up nose, rear corners and the rustiest rocker you've ever
seen, at least it drives!  Now I drive it when I need some motivation for my
project 65.

&gt; Why dont you scramble through that stack and throw together a beater
&gt; engine and make a drivable bus and keep your rebuild for when you have the
&gt; cash. Im sure that actually havinga drive in it even if its far from
&gt; finished will change your outlook a lot.
