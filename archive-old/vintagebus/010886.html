I paid $12.96 for it in Northern Indiana.  There's one on ebay right now for $22.99  no bidders fortunately.

for those who feel they need to buy the store out of them I believe you are in the same class as this ebay fellow.  For you hoping to retire off of cleaning the shelves off at Walmart you need to do what this fellow ebay person is doing, what a great service.

Can we stop this crap and get back to the real thing.  There, someone had to say it.

Dear List,
I purchased the bus/bug/trailer combo at a Western Michigan Wal-mart,
and paid $17.95 for it.  I had mentioned to another list member about
the great range in pricing in different parts of the country.
Has anyone else paid this much?
