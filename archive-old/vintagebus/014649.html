That's what puzzles me. First the guy says it's a Kombi and then that it has

13 windows, no middle seat. Well, OK middle seat could of been taken out at

some point. I didn't get the VIN # from him. He waited three weeks anyway so

I don't want to pull his leg. If there's something goofy about the whole

thing, I'll just walk away and just enjoy my trip. Problem is I'll be

hauling a trailer all the way from Chicago.

well, I would not worry too much about whether the guy calls it a kombi or a 
microbus or whatever.   Those terms, while one certain circle mean certain 
models, in other are just another word for bus.  If he says it has 13 
windows, it probably does.   if he said there is no middle seat, ditto, but 
like you say it could have walked away at some point.
