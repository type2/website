&lt;&lt; The pump is of a high-volume design.  Will this cause problems since a
 single relief case cannot limit the maximum oil pressure seen by the
 bearings? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Just the filtering process requires a bit higher pressure output of the pump. 
 If you have concerns about this then best to install oil pressure and temp 
gauges before installing the aftermarket filter pump and see the before and 
after results.  We have not seen any big changes in these varibles in our VWs 
with vintage EMPI pumps or the more recent CB filter pumps (Which are the 
only ones we have seen made today that are worth buying.) made by Shradek 
(SP?)  (Which happens to be a major manufacture of stock VW oil pumps!) at 
most the oil pressure is about ten Lbs. higher with no noticable changes in 
oil temps.  Eric&amp;Barb
