Subject: Re: Repro taillights.

no, I was talking about the early ones.... sounds like repros are not even close to originals and
expensive..

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Repro taillights.


| I have a repro taillight (large oval style) on the passenger side of
| my '64 and it works OK.  Not sure if it's from WW though.  Comparing
| it to the '66 tail light on the left side: The '66 has a cast plate
| and stamped reflector.  The repro is all stamped.  The '66 has its
| socket mounted to the reflector with tabs only.  The repro has the
| socket mounted with tabs and gray expoxy.  The '66 has a VW logo and
| SWF stamped in the lens retaining ring and the repro does not.  The
| gasket on the outside of the Bus is not as thick on the repro as on
| the '66.  The '66 has faded silver paint inside the reflector and
| the repro is chromed - much shinier.  Both lights have a push-on for
| a ground wire.
|
| Both lights seem to work pretty well.  The fresh chrome on the
| reflector of the repro does make it a little brighter.
