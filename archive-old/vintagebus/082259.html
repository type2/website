Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Have to disable a bus

A parent is asking YOU to help raise their child by disabling a bus? I'd 
suggest to the parent that they disable the bus after they buy it if 
they think that is how to raise a child. Wow! Outsourcing child rearing! 
Can a non-licensed person register a vehicle? Would a parent allow a 
minor child operate an unregistered vehicle?

&gt;&gt;I found a buyer for the pristine 67 Deluxe, problem is he is only 15 years
&gt;&gt;old and his mom does not trust him. Apparently, he wears tie-dye so must do
&gt;&gt;drugs and stuff like that. In addition, his hair is kinda shaggy looking.
