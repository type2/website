In a message dated 98-10-25 18:01:04 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt;  I understand that....what I am saying is that I have an engine
 sitting on the floor that will not let the dizzy slip in at TDC of #1 with
 both valves closed without rotating the rotor bug 180 degrees from the rim
 notch.  Normally, a flathead screw driver will fit a screw two ways and
 that is the way a vdub dizzy looks but that doesnt seem to be the case. &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
If you look at the top of the distributor drive shaft you will see that the
slot is offset to one side.  This only allows the distributor to go into the
drive shaft one way only.  It sounds like you possibly have the drive shaft
backwards in the case.  The other slight possibility is that someone removed
and turned 180 degrees the gear that is pinned to the bottom of the
distributor you are using instead of fixing the position of thier distributor
drive gear.  To check this you need to set the distributor up for #1 at TDC in
the engine and then check # 3 cylinder to make sure it is about 3 degrees less
advanced than the #1 cylinder setting.  If it is opposite then you need to
switch the gear on the distributor.  All of this of course also depends if
your distributor drive gear is in the right place to where the distributor
sets.
