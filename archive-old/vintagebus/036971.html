The VW bus tool kit, wrapped in the original interior vinyl
tool wrap.  Everything else on the bus has changed
color, how this remained intact &amp; original is beyond me.
It is the same color as the bus was built per the M-codes....

I thought that VW didnt bother matching these?  Lucky coincedence, or am I
misinformed?
