Subject: Making a DC?
Date: Fri, 12 Jan 2001 20:42:16 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have my old 66 13 window deluxe (rusty special) sitting out on the back
porch and I've actually envisioned it as a DC.  Right now I'm just pipe
dreaming and thinking of various alternatives to getting a double cab
(remember - on a budget!!!).  I think making a DC is a neat idea but I hate
conversions where it looks like Jethro and the boys drug out there
arcwelders and had a good time.

So I ask, does it sound feasible to look for a DC with a decent rear end but
maybe a smashed up and totaled out front end?  Then take the front of my 66
walk-thru and cut the whole bus in half, merging it with the DC bed?  The
only mod required then would be to put a back on the cab or do as I have
seen done with a baywindow, just weld the hatch area in place so you still
have a hatch that opens up into the bed area.

Just an idea - it sounds like it would be fun but yes,a lot of work.  Can
you say spools of welding wire? :-)
