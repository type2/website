&gt; I heard that there's an ad with a bus in it on the
&gt; inside back cover of Time magazine, and I think it's a
&gt; bus I used to own

hey j.p.  you should know to ask a librarian.  ;-)  i've been preoccupied with tracking material purchases and going to meetings about promotion and tenure but finally got around to checking our library's shelves.  from the feb. 24, 2003 issue:

http://home.csumb_dot_edu/~holl1802/jp/  (the scans are big)

now i'll just get back to thinking up reasons that my hobby should figure into the promotion and tenure process....  man, i just have to say that i love my new job!  nearly all of the other librarian's i work with prefer and drive volkswagens (water-cooled) or some other german manufacture.  a couple of the library staff are hobbyists in other vehicle arenas.  i've been getting the impression that a major factor in my being hired was my admission of my outside/off-time interest!

cheers,
