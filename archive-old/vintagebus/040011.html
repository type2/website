Good clue on the windshield.. a keeper for sure!

So... ever done a deluxe corner ?  I know more than one of us listees are 
still hopeing for hints on this one.

&gt;Hi VWbus,
&gt;Did you start to pull the window seal into the body frame at bottom 
&gt;center?If not you are pretty much guaranteed to shatter the glass
&gt;due to the tapered shape of the window opening.  Plus using roofing tar as 
&gt;a sealant painted on the the body opening also lubricates the window seal 
&gt;and allows it to &gt;pop in way easier.  Eric&amp;Barb
