That kind of sounds like the same sound I heard when my GLAND nut broke on
my engine in my bus.

Subject: [VB] '59 Kombi...back to the clutch


Today I got a new clutch cable and bowden tube from Ronnie at 
http://www.oldvolks_dot_com . I didn't waste time tonight pulling the old 
ones and putting the new ones in. I found out that my cable was fine. 
The bowden tube had worn so that it let the washers slip and lost 
it's correct amount of drop. Also was torn right at that end a 
little. So that's where I was getting trouble with the noise and 
tight cable.

BUT...I've still got an uncomfertable rumbly sound when I let off the 
clutch. Kind of a vibrating rumble sound...whooouuummmppp. I just 
replaced all new clutch parts 500 miles ago. Maybe something is out 
of wack. I don't know. Looks like I'll probably have to pull the 
engine...unless anyone else has some ideas that don't require that.

Suggestions?????
