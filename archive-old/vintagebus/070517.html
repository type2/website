Subject: RE: [VB] Tow Hitch

&gt; Where is the hitch on the bus depot site?  A search for 
&gt; 'hitch' returns 1933 results, but doesn't actually display 
&gt; anything.  (don't get me started on lame e-commerce sites!)


The search worked fine just now when I tried it on my lame e-commerce
site. Most likely you were searching in the wrong year. Remember, he
said this is a hitch for a '71, so if you searched under splitty parts
it would (quite correctly) find none. I have seen some errors recently
with the results page displaying the wrong hit count, which might
explain the 1933 (a minor bug which will be fixed soon).  But other than
displaying the wrong count, the search engine is working properly, and
is displaying all matching results (assuming of course that you search
in the right category).

In any case, I think he's referring to:
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=PVW7  But I don't think
it would work on a Splitty (although I myself have not tried it), since
the bumper mounts differently.  We list it as fitting '68-71.
