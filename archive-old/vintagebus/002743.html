But that's a reason for bidding high. Why bid $100 on a '53 van (currently
~$4k, reserve not yet met) when you know it is going to go for several
grand? Maybe,...just maybe,...no one saw the ad,...and there was no
reserve,...yeah, right!

&gt; It's a psycological tactic.  Once people start bidding, they get the Crazy
&gt; Bidder Menatality, with concentric circles spinning in their eyes,
&gt; maniacally determined to win the auction at any price.
&gt;
&gt; They also fall into the Previous Investment Trap.  Any time they've
already
&gt; spent searching the various auction sites, watching the auction, analysing
&gt; the item being auctioned, dreaming about what they'll do with whatever
&gt; they're bidding on, etc, etc, gets counted as invesment which will go to
&gt; waste if they don't win.
&gt;
&gt; Got to go now. I've get auctions I'm watching, bids to make, bids to make,
&gt; bids, bids to make, bi bi bi bids to to ma ma ma make  [drool, stammer,
&gt; spit, hiccup, choke, roll eyes back like slot machine reels, swallow
&gt; tongue, etc, etc]...
