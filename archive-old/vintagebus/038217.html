Subject: RE:  Undercoating?

Here is my two cents on undercoating.
Originaly in the 50s &amp; early 60s VW put a wax undercoating on their
cars.  This would eventually wash off over time.  Some dealerships would
spray a plastic type of undercoating on the vehicles.  From what I've
seen of most rubber or plastic undercoatings is that they all flake off
and allways trap dirt/salt/water and cause RUST.  To me they are just a
waste of money when done from a rattle can.  I have/had (I say had cause
most of it rusted away) 62 beetle with real thick undercoating and when
it started flaking it traped water and rusted the body. My square back
had undercoating on it till I scratched it ALL off with my fingernail
and a screw driver.  I would advise against these types of undercoating,
especially from a rattle can.

If you want to really protect the bottom of your Bus, paint the bottom
with IMRON.  IMRON paint is pretty much bullet proof.  One test I read
about IMRON was really neat.  It was sprayed on a sheet of Reynolds
aluminium foil and cured, the foil was then crumpled into a ball.  When
the foil was straightened out again the IMRON was still sticking to the
foil with NO cracks or chips.  Try that with any other paint and it will
crack and flak off.

My 65 bus had the Wax undercoating and is covered in a nice thin layer
of road dirt now.  :-D
