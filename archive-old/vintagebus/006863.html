I use this stuff on a regular bsis in my wifes Ast#o van with fuel
injection. All these add to gas cleaners are is Techron, the same additive
put in Chevron gasoline, so running a few tanks of Chevron would have the
same effect, also from what I've been told is Texaco is useing the same
additive now in their fuels.

hey,
i was watching the Indians game last night and they kept showing this 
commercial for carb/fuel injection cleaner. does this stuff do anything, or 
should i take the $4 and buy lunch with it. WITHOUT CARB ADJUSTMENT, has 
anyone ever noticed any improvements after using any of this crap? smoother 
idle, better mileage, cleaning jets???
just a thought,
BOB
