Hey all, 

   I have a questions about FACTORY installed radios in our busses.

   I got lucky and got a bus with an M-code for a FACTORY intalled Radio. (M097) Of course, the Radio is lone gone....

    Does anyone know a good source of Blaupunkt radio history?  According to one of my pieces of literature, it says that an 'emden' radio was installed in my bus.  I want to know if this was just a fact on paper or did they install whatever blaupunkt was avaialble?

   I check on vintagebus registry for others with Factory installed radios, but didn't find anyone else.

   Eventually, I will get a 'correct' radio for my bus. 

   Can anyone help me?
