Hi Jason,
Manifold - Intake and pre-heating pipe for speed limiter 211 129 551 C/E, 42 
bhp.
If you want to trade that one off of your hands please tell us.  We have a 
few of the goveners and only one intake manifold for them.

 &lt;&lt;    113 129 701 M&gt;&gt;
?

 &lt;&lt;    113 129 701 AA&gt;&gt;
Motor H 5 000 001 to H 5 900 000
Motor B 6 000 001 to B 6 600 000

&lt;&lt;     113 129 701 (C?... kind of blurred in the casting)... this last one has
 what seems like a *miniscule* intake diameter where it would fit to the
 cylinder heads... the flanges themselves are *fixed*, whereas on all of the
 abovementioned manifolds, there is kind of a little flange-piecelet that will
 move around some above the actual sealing flange.. &gt;&gt;
Sounds like a 25, 36 or 40 HP intake manifold.  The 40 HP model will have the 
same diamond shaped pre-heat riser seals as the 1300/1500/1600cc later 
engines.  The 25-36 has a more triangle shaped seals there.   Eric&amp;Barb
