I use Hagerty.  They are very easy to set up and quite reasonable for collector.  Look at their website http://www.hagerty_dot_com/

You have to have a &quot;garage&quot;, and you can only drive a limited amount of miles.

All the talk of smashed buses lately has me thinking of insurance, Can anyone 
recomend a good company for collector/antique auto insurance?
