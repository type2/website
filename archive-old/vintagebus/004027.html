Hello Everyone

    I have been driving my bus for about a year now and all of the sudden I
will get off the highway and not be able to shift.  The bus shifts fine when
cold but when I drive it around for a little while it start shifting badly.
Could this have to do with one of the shifting forks? Has anyone had this
problem before.

Thanks in advance
67 Deluxe Bus stopped dead in its tracks until the Transmission Fairy drops
off a new one!

Sincerely
Eric and Christy Lykens
