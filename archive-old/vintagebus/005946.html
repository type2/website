Hello Everyone!

    I was wondering if any one new of someone on the California Coast that
clear coats aluminum or Anodizes the pieces and which one would be the best
way to go. I would like to protect my beltline trim on my 67 deluxe after it
gets back from the polishing shop. The gentleman that is doing the work is
not sure of any locations in my area for this. Does anyone know of a source
for this.

PS: I am in central California!

Sincerely
Eric and Christy Lykens
