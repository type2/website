Hi All,
Several have asked for this info.

To obtain a birth certificate for your vehicle, send 20 DM (~13 US $, but
check the exchange rate first) along with your chassis number to:

Vehicle identity certificate
Stiftung Auto Museum Volkswagen
Dieselstrabe 35
38436 Wolfsburg  GERMANY


They say to allow ~ 4 weeks for delivery.

The instructions I read said the price was 10 DM but the letter they
returned to me asked me for $13 US for each research of vehicle data...
heck, next time, I think I'll send them a nice crisp $20 and make them
happy... it's well worth it and you get more info than just the birth
certificate.  Plus, sending a bit of a bonus may keep the service going for
a bit longer.
