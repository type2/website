&gt; I've been off the list during the winter and I'm curious as to whether or
&gt; not anyone has pinned down Todd Hill in regards to his business.  I bought a
&gt; 700 dollar tranny from the dude and it lasted two weeks before it took a big
&gt; crap. I then replaced it with an excellent unit from Transaxle Engineering
&gt; in Chatsworth, CA ( I highly recommend these folks). I've had no trouble
&gt; navigating the hills of Southeast Missouri with the taller 4th gear and ring
&gt; and pinion setup. I'm running a rebuilt 1640cc dp in my '65 micro/camper
&gt; just in case anyone is interested. It's nice to be back and read the daily
&gt; chatter from the familiar names (which is a hell of a lot better than tranny
&gt; chatter).  Jim

Todd is still hiding.
check out http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/toddhill.html

The latest news is that around Thanksgiving '99 one of us that got the shaft,
showed up on his door step.  &quot;Hi Todd, I'm Joe Doe&quot;  This was followed by the
moment of why does that name sound familar and then the realization that this
guy must have just driven 800+ miles to get his money and transmission.  The guy
walked out of there with a box full of trans parts (supposedly done and ready to
ship) and a check (it cleared) for his deposit.

I have tried to get Todd to answer my letters and phone calls with no luck.
Cross country is too far to travel to collect $300.  This summer, I will be just
a stones throw away from Cincinnatti, so Todd will be getting another &quot;happy&quot;
customer dropping in on him when he least expects it.
