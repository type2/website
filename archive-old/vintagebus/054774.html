Subject: Re: [VB] Crowsfoot wheels

i can't help with the two-date stuff (my one crow's foot has a tire on it) other than to suggest that perhaps the wheels were made in two parts and each part was dated.  that's just a guess based on nothing.

i also can't help you much about when crow's foot rims were made but i heard here on this list that they were made for more than two years.  i'd check the one i have but i know that i've not been able to find a date on it in the past.  roger of '67 buses fame has a couple of crow's foot rims and if i remember correctly they do not have tires on them.  convincing him that he did not need 15&quot; rims for '67 buses was met with total resistance so i did not even get to examine them for a date.  (i guess i was lucky to keep my hand!  haha!)

i checked dropgate_dot_com in hopes of finding information there but didn't find anything in the m-code or the year-to-year section.  with just 30 minutes for lunch that was about all i could do plus typing this reply.  gotta go be a librarian again.

&gt; The one wheel that
&gt; came with the bus had two different dates on it.
&gt; 
&gt; The rim (outside) part of the wheel had the date 2/57
&gt; but the web (the wide-five part) had the date 7/57! 
&gt; Thinking that this was curious, I checked the other
&gt; four that I had on hand and found the following:
&gt; 
&gt; Wheel       Outside date    Inside date
&gt; 
&gt; #1             4/58            12/58
&gt; 
&gt; #2             2/59             5/59
&gt; 
&gt; #3 and #4      1/59             1/59
&gt; 
&gt; This brings to mind a couple of questions.  I thought
&gt; that there were only 1957 and 1958 crowsfoot wheels
&gt; produced.  Were there later wheels produced for people
&gt; who bent/destroyed the earlier ones?  And why would
&gt; wheel #1 have a lapse of 8 months between the two
&gt; dates.  Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your thoughts.
