  i like the way they went from quarterly, to bimonthly, to monthly 
and then back to bimonthly! then they went 'outta business' and were 
folded into:
vw&amp;porsche:
feb 79 through oct 86, inclusive; then jumps to june 88, oct 88, dec 
88, apr 89, jun 89, aug 89, oct 89, dec 89 and feb 90.  includes the 
84 performance accessory guide. i'll throw in porsche classics #3 to 
boot.  56 issues.
$75 + postage

buy the two above together for $100!

vw action:
aug 84, oct 84, dec 84, feb 85, apr 85.
  $8 plus shipping.

volkswagen classics:
spring 83,  summer 83, fall 83, winter 83, april 84, june 4, aug 84.
$10 + shipping


all of the above mags are in good shape: a few covers are loose, and 
i found 1 or 2 ads missing, but that's it.

i have LOTS  of vw trends and hot vws; i'll likely be selling some of 
them as well - let me know any specific issues you want, or i'll 
likely just go year by year..........
