&gt;These people are like weeds. I send them mail saying that these
&gt;auctions are against ebay policy; you cannot sell CD-Rs compiled
&gt;from information from the web, especially if you don't hold the
&gt;copyright.

A few points, just speaking for myself here...

- The &quot;Online Doc Project&quot; manuals are not hosted by vintagebus_dot_com .
  They are on another site.  Thom has links to them, but he doesn't
  host them.  (Having looked at the mentioned auction, I do agree
  that it looks a lot like a PDF from the doc project.)  The only
  scans hosted on vintagebus_dot_com are the color wiring diagrams and
  a few pages of service bulletins and accessory installation
  instructions.

- If VW were to fire up their landsharks, the doc project would be
  in trouble too.  Even though the doc project doesn't charge anything,
  and has a policy of not providing anything that is already available
  commercially (e.g. no scans of the Bentleys), VW still holds the
  copyright on the manuals.  If VW demanded that the manuals be taken
  down, legally, the doc project would have to do so.

- On the other hand, I can't believe that VW's landsharks don't know
  about the doc project yet.  It doesn't really change the legal
  standing of anything, but maybe since they haven't complained yet,
  there is a bit of hope.

- As you mentioned, this isn't the first time this has happened.  A
  few years back a guy was caught auctioning collections of articles
  from the Library at type2_dot_com .  After a few stern e-mails, he
  stopped...  or at least changed email addresses.
