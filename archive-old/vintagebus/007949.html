Don't our latches get a little tighter just as we're opening them? Something
like a detent ball that has to rise out of it's detent in order to move?
Seems to me that Thom's suggestion to tighten the strike tab is one that you
should not dismiss lightly. Give it a try, you can always bend it back.

&gt; First let me say thanks for all of the reply 's and
&gt; suggestions....
&gt; however, let me explain that the wing windows are in
&gt; perfect condition and the latches hold the windows
&gt; very tight, so tight that the whistle gets quieter as
&gt; I start to unlatch. The rubber is like new and seals
&gt; great! Still, the noise, the noise
&gt;
&gt; Keep the suggestions coming..
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
