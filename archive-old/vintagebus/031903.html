&lt;&lt; Who/what mix is chamelion? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gary,
Chamelion is a powder coat color.  Do not remember which manufacture made it, 
but believe it is not availible anymore.  We got 12 rims done about four 
years ago, and the shop is so good they were able to use the coating still 
after all this time.  Apparently powder coating has a shelf life of about 6 
to 12 months.  After which it clumps up badly, but this shop we frequent has 
figured out how to repowderize it.  Eric&amp;Barb
