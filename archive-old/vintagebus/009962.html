I have the first New Beetle Turbo sold by my local dealer, just &quot;had to have
it&quot; and 24,000 miles later I still don't regret it. I have never confused my
reason for buying my NB with my reason for owning 2 air cooled beetles and 3
split window buses.
You will never see my '66 Westy  or my 64 convertible sitting in remote
parking at O'Hare, but my NB is there about 30 per cent of the time. I don't
expect to get what I paid for my NB, because when I sell it, it will be used
up.
My NB is an appliance, something I bought for utility and service. The
aircooled VW's are in a different league altogether.
I enjoy you guys who drive your buses exclusively, but that's not my life,
it's yours.
I'd like to have a new microbus too.
John Flowers
