Subject: Westfalia Fabrik # Question
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 22:20:23 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does anybody know when the brass plates at the bottom corner of the z-bed
where started?? Is this an SO42 and up practice only, or does it date back
to SO23s and SO34s?

If I have a '66 Westfalia with the Fabrik # 5000 engraved on the plate does
this mean that it is the 5000th Westfalia of the SO42 series?

Trivia: Based on Thom's registry of Westfalias the Fabrik # would indicate
approx 70 a day where made at the factory. Sound right?? Any Westfalia
historians in the crowd care to voice an opinion.....

Thanks in advance for any info you might have....

Scott
