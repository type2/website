Hey folks,

Here's the story: I was getting the old &quot;click&quot; when I turned the ignition key, with nothing happening. This problem has come back on and off over the years. So I installed a relay at the starter/solenoid, thinking that would finally solve it for good. It worked for about a week, then the problem came back. So now I start the bus by crawling under and shorting the two solenoid connections with a screw driver - that works fine, but eventually I'd like to get it to work with the key again. Any suggestions on what could be causing this? I have a new voltage regulator and new wires to the battery. All connections at the starter/solenoid are new and look good. The battery is new too. I'm thinking it's got to be somewhere between the starter/solenoid/relay and the ignition switch. When I turn the ignition to on and short the solenoid connections, it starts fine - so the ignition switch is working....right?

Thanks,
-Wilder
