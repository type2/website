Ok.  I have to meet the person willing to spend $242 clams on a NOS
washer bottle!  Its still a day to go too.  I had a cow when I saw one
for $75 at a Pomona 6 months ago.  What, did the Y2K bug visit 6 months
early??  Did we slip into an alternate dimension?   All I can say is
that Larry R. should be mighty happy tonight.

S.
