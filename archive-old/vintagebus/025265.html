devices?  You know, the ones you hit with a sledge hammer.  They fit
around the nut and are only about 6&quot; long.  I have one for each nut size
and they work everytime, even on busses that havent been ran since the
early 70's.  I got one after I broke every Craftsman cheater I owned
(now sears owns).&quot;

I haven't had any luck with those in the two times I've had occasion to
use them.  A few days ago one didn't produce the desired result on my
'74 Westfalia; and I promptly took the bus down the street to a place
that maintains trucks for Baltimore City.  A kid there hauled out an
impact wrench the size of a fat chihuahua and it did the trick, but not
immediatly, and not without some sustained grunting by the chihuahua and
some galling of the metal behind the castelated nut (not the threads,
thankfully).

And it was gratis.  I was quite pleased.
