Fellow listees,

Although I have been on this list for almost three years, I never had the
opportunity to offer something up for sale, and had no idea the volume of
replies it would generate!  

You guys and gals are fantastic!  Also hungry for parts too (aren't we
all?).

Anyway,the carb set has been sold,  Thanks for all the replies.

Now back to the list, which is already in progress...
