Subject: City on my butt!

   Well, it finally happened... the City of Stillwater (Oklahoma) is on
my ass about having my bus sitting in my driveway without an engine
and a tarp over it. As I do not have a double garage and I keep my
Harley in the rest of the garage along with my work shop area, washer/dryer,
bicycles and many years accumulation, I do not have any space to put the
bus, except in the driveway. Seems they consider it a &quot;junk motor vehicle&quot;
   After reading the *complete* statute that I supposedly &quot;violated&quot; (funny
how they only state the parts of the statute that they feel appropriate!),
I found that it states: &quot;This statute does not apply...to a vehicle being
restored or repaired when reasonable progress is being made&quot;, so I
am going to fight city hall on the fact that I am restoring and repairing
this vehicle!
   Wish me luck...more to come!
