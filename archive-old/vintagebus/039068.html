&gt; 3.)  When test-fitting my new main bearings (Mahle-made-in Mexico), I
&gt; found that the big round bearing that goes on the flywheel end of the
&gt; crank doesn't fit properly in the case.  You know how it goes onto the
&gt; case like a saddle fits on a horse?  Well, mine has about 1/8&quot; play
from
&gt; front-to-back (like the horse is too skinny for the saddle).  All the
&gt; others fit fine.  Is this normal or do I have a big problem here???

Ah, so!  I learn yet another tasty technical tidbit about type 1 motors!
When I ordered my bearings, I knew the case had been bored to .020 and
that my crank was standard.  

What I DIDN'T know was that my thrust had been cut!  (Happens to all of
us in old age I suppose.)  Oh well, so now I've got a &quot;std, .020, std&quot;
set of bearings when what I need is a &quot;std, .020, .040&quot; set (still needs
to be verified by my machinist).  

The best part is that I've already installed the one that goes on the
crank underneath the cam gear and I'm NOT taking that bad boy off of
there again!  So unless I can buy just the thrust bearing I need, I'm in
for another $25-30 for a whole new set of bearings with the correct
thrust.  Anyone need a new &quot;.020, std, std&quot; set?  I'm about to have one
for sale cheap.

Anyway, thanks to all who supplied the missing piece of THAT fraggin
puzzle for me.

I'm learning...  I'm learning...  I'm learning......
