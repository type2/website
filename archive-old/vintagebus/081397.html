Subject: Re: [VB] univeral grease?

&gt; the bentley says to lubricate accel. &amp; heater cables with &quot;univeral 
&gt; grease&quot;... What the heck is that and what kinda of look will my local 
&gt; FLAPS employee give me when I ask for that?  I tried using some lithium 
&gt; grease but that seemed to get sticky...

There are lots of brands out there.
I have been using the Loctite/Synco Super Lube for years on pretty much all 
my stuff. It is a synthetic NLGI grade 2 with teflon. It is waterproof and 
doesn't attract dust/dirt,( which is a real plus on the the mountain bike 
chain if you use the spray lube) It would be good for most jobs except the 
ones that need a molybedendum additive.
