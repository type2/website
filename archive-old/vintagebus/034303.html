	I had the same troubles, Josh. Here is what Clara had to say...

  ...The wheels spinning somewhat with tranny in neautral when wheels are in
the
air is normal.   possibly your shift couple screw have come loose, meaning
you
could move the shift stick around and not affect the tranny.   In this case
it
wouldn't feel like you are going into gear  Does the clutch pedal feel
normal?
Do you feel the gears when you shift it.  (you know when you shift gears you
feel it moving out of say 1st and through a free spot (neutral) and then
past
a pressure (into 2nd) and then it's meshed and you are in gear and ease off
the clutch?    Crwl under the bus and look unde rthe stick shift.  If there
is
a belly pan remove it (10 mm bolts) .   see how it moves?  The bottom end of
the shiftt stick pokes through the floor and connects in a ball and socket
joint to a funnily bbent rod that runs front to back.  Then there is a
connection to a straight rod front to back.  the rear rod passes through a
tube n the body f the bus.   now wiggle back so you are looking at the nose
of
the tranny  .  The rear part of the rear rod comes out of the tube and is
attached to a shift coupler.   the couple should have two screw usually
square
8mm heads, with wires through them tied around the rod.  The wires keep the
bolts from falling out if they get loose but people sometimes dont wire them
up (duh).   are the bolts tight?  The shift couple attaches the rod to the
hockey stick that goes into (out of?) the tranny and actually selects the
gear
desired. (we hope, but it seems along the way something is wrong)

Then again I have seen buses with bent hockey sticks.   icks.  shift
problem.

so check the shift linkage- seems the first place to start.   I have had a
bolt drop out of my shift couple and not be able to change gears.

	PS: 	IT TOOK ME 3 DAYS TO FIGURE OUT REVERSE WAS TO THE LEFT AND
DOWN INSTEAD OF TO THE RIGHT AND DOWN.
