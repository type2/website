If it passes the spit test sounds like it's alright.    Hey how do you slow 
down and keep the R's  (rpms?) up at the same time?  Or is that using the 
high ratio fan (opposite of power pulley) pulley system?

 But I can still touch my dipstick!, after driving all day and the spit test
 doesn't sizzle. I did slow down though and try to keep my R's up for max
 cooling fan speed, I would guess I'm running around 200 degrees, that's why
 I use Valvoline Racing oil, doesn't break down in those temps!

 Hm, maybe he's saying it's going to be hot when you drive it, don't expect 
 any 160F oil temps and we won't believe you if you say it does.
 
 Clara- at about 50F cooler  than 120F.

  The problem is you live in Arizona! Don't leave anything out in the sun!
 And
  I've heard it'll just get hotter if you burn gasoline in it!
