Subject: Hoop Fit Funkyness

I'd mentioned some time ago that the front hoop didn't fit right on my double cab.

Here's some pix of the problem area - any ideas?

Since I had 2 front hoops, I took the better of the two and and use it in
the front, then modified the ugly one to be a rear hoop.

Another local bus guy is making me wood slats out of oak, they should  
be ready early next week.  He brought them by today for a test fit and
to mark the holes, and they looked *nice*.  Thanks to Wade and dropgates_dot_com
for the dimensions.
