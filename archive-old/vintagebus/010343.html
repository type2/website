look on page h-7 / 4 of the bently workshop manual for the 63-67,   what is
that guy looking at?
he is so wierd ,his left hand looks almost twice as big as his right hand,
is he some kind of german science expirement to create the genetically
perfect vw mechanic? was he takin from his parents as a child and
ritualistically trained? is he a secret german mechanic droid mutant?
wouldnt it be cool if this guy lived in your garage and worked on your bus
whenever you werent driving it?
