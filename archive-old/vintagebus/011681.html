Subject: Bus eats pulleys
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a '71 bus that I have owned and enjoyed for the last eight years or so. It  is on its second engine rebuild since I have owned it - actually, the engine in it now is a total replacement, as the old case was cracked under the oil cooler. Which brings me to my point of puzzlement...

This thing eats generator pulleys. Tears them up where the shaft goes through. I have a whole collection of trashed pulleys that I've accumulated over the years.  I have been through three different generators and have changed fans, all to no avail. I figured that the problem would go away with the new engine, but NO! The darned thing went out again on a recent road trip, causing the engine to severely overheat, as the generator light was not functioning properly. AAAARRRGH!!!!

I keep the belt tension adjusted as recommended and do not have any extreme driving habits. This is a stock 1600DP. Has anyone else encountered this problem before? The VW heads that I have talked to are all puzzled by this phenomenon. I have used german pulleys, brazilian, and whatever else was available - it eats them all equally well. 

Any thoughts?

Russell
