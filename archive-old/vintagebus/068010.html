Subject: recylindr head temp

I have heard that a deep sump will not affect temperatures too much, have
you tried using synthetic oil? As its' lubricating qualities are superior,
maybe your engine would run cooler-due to less friction in the engine block.

and no i have never hooked up any gauges to my engine-so i have no idea what
temps i am running....just thought you might try this as it is an easy thing
to try-relatively inexpensive, and easy to switch back if it doesn't make a
difference.
