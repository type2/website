 &lt;&lt; My 67 Bus wanders on the road, I know it is in need of a front end
  alignment, but wherever I go they tell me that they can't do cars this
  old. I went to a VW dealer and they said that no adjustments could be
  made, but the Bently manual says otherwise. What should I do? &gt;&gt;
 
 Chris,
 A few years ago, I needed my 67 aligned.  The Big O by my house said they 
 couldn't do it, but the one by my work said they could.  (The bus met an 
 untimely death and never was aligned.)
 It may take a while, and a lot of foot work, but you'll be able to find a 
 shop with a &quot;old timer&quot; or maybe someone who has a bug or bus and knows how 
 to do it.
  &gt;&gt;

are you sure that all it needs is an alignment?   your tie rods/drag 
link/swing lever/king&amp;link pins/steering box are also in the steering, and 
one, or some combination of, could have play.    Check you Idiot's Guide by 
John Muir for directions on checking these out.  You could also get the specs 
out of the Bentley manual and tell them to the people at the alignment place, 
it is a simple process to do, they would just need the specs.
