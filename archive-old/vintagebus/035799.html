&lt;&lt; Geez! It sounds like I should have it re-installed. I have about a 4th 
grade level with engine mechanic. If I had this done at my local garage, what 
do you think a reasonable cost be for this part and install?&gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
Best to start now, and learn.  Most shops today will carge you $150.00 on up, 
just to remove/install your engine.  So even if you mess things up at first 
you are paying your self to learn.  Plus later on trips youy have much more 
of a chance to fix it yourself.  Remember we all had to start learning 
somewhere!  Take your engine out, and if it is a unknow mileage engine or 
over 30,000 miles since it's last rebuild strip it down to a long block.  
Retorque all the engine case, and head fasteners.  This will make the engine 
tighter, and help pervent oil, exaust leaks.  Install the thermostat bellows, 
and it's mounting bracket.  Then put back all the sheet metal, exaust, and 
intake manifolds.  Install the thermostatic flaps inside the shroud, and when 
you put the shroud back on the engine make sure to put the linkage rod to the 
bellows though the outer hole through the head fins between #1, and 2.  
   As an added bonus before you do all the above check out your engine to see 
if you have the doghouse cooler system.  If not, find the parts for both the 
doghouse system, and the thermostatic bellows system so you have them ready 
to install.

&lt;&lt;Could you please also teach me how and what the thermostat does? I 
understand that it opens at a certain temp., but thats about it.  &gt;&gt;
The bellow thermostat mounts under the cylinders connect to the flaps in the 
shroud by a rod.  When the engine is below 160-170F the bellows contracts due 
to whatever chemical is in it.  Over 160-170F the bellows expands pushing the 
flaps open allowing the cooling air to the cylinders/heads.  If the bellow 
fails there is a spring on the flaps linkage rod to pull open the flaps.
