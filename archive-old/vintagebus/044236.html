Might be :

	Club International de Camping-Car Westfalia

Based in Montreal as I recall.  I just tried to open that site from the 
shortcut I've had saved for a long time, and got a &quot;404&quot; error message.  You 
could enter that title in a search engine and see what pops up.

As I recall this site was quite graphics intensive, with many pages of 
members' photos.

Good luck...

Jaime:

That sounds like it might have been either Le Westihaus:

  http://colba_dot_net/~vladesco/westhaus.htm

or Les Wests d'laut Bord d'la Gate:
