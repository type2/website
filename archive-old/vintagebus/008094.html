Charles:

If you lower the rear of your Bus at all with the reduction boxes still in
place, camber will be effected. The swing axle conversion kit is the most
popular way to drop the back end.

All of the dropped spindles we have seen on the market are MUCH WEAKER than
stock spindles and are also missing the stops. That is why we only sell the
adjustable beam. As long as you don't lower it all the way down to the
snubbers, the ride is still pretty smooth.

Details can be seen here: http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbsusp.htm

Thank You.

&gt; I plan on lowering my bus that I have. I know of the lowering kit that is
on
&gt; the market that does away with the reduction boxes, but can you lower it
&gt; just like a bug by turning the splines, and leave the reduction boxes? And
&gt; if so, how much can you lower it before the camber gets too ridiculous?
Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually done it), that
&gt; you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to the right,
and
&gt; vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber, or bumpsteer.
