Douglas and all,

I don't consider this the controversial issue that everyone else does.... to
me it is a technical conversation that the archives will reveal has not
gotten that much SERIOUS discussion.  This list has talked more about
www.EBAY_dot_com than it has about our magnesium engine and RPM!

With that out of the way... I do NOT agree with Douglas.  My 1967 Westy will
clearly go up to 6000 RPM if I hold the gas pedal down, but that doesn't
mean it is good for it!

Yes, Bosch makes rev limiters, I also purchased a RPM rev limiter
(electronic) from Berg that goes all the way up to 10,0000 RPM... is that
evidence that my engine was designed for 10,000 RPM -- of course not.

The issues is UNDERSTANDING the behavior of an engine that is over-RPM.  It
isn't like it just blows up the first time you go over 4500RPM... it just
wears much faster and gets much hotter.

I have run my engine at over 270 degrees oil temps for 12 hours at a time,
and it didn't just blow up... yet I am surely putting MUCH MORE STRESS and
WEAR on it than if my oil temperature was at 240 degrees.

These things aren't easily proven... you would have to build two IDENTICAL
engines, which is no easy task, then run them on some type of bench and see
the results.

I expect the difference between running 5000RPM and 4000RPM (for sustained
highway driving) red-line is the difference between an engine that lasts for
20,000 miles and one that lasts 60,000 miles.  It isn't likely to just fail
right away...

THE THING YOU MUST NEVER FORGET in all these transaxle and RPM discussions
is that this is a tiny tiny tiny little engine (in terms of power, not
literally size) pushing this big old bus.

Take the Muir book, written in the early 1970's, as evidence that even when
these things were &quot;not yet that old&quot; and still &quot;brand new&quot; that it was
pretty much common observation that the exact same engine in a bus would
need a rebuild sooner than a bug.  I don't have my Muir book handy, but it
said something like 60,000 miles vs. 90,000 miles.

At this time, I'm of the opinion that this longevity is tied to the
gearing... to get going off the line with the extra weight of a bus, all the
gears are lower than a bug.  And there is no additional 5th gear... yet
traffic goes the same speed if you are in a Bus or Bug.  So at 65MPH in a
bug you are at around 3000 RPM, in a bus around 4000 RPM.

The vw is redlined at 5000 rpm for sustained use. Calc your
speed at that rpm and you have your top end speed. I think
it will surprise you. (you may not want to go that fast;
brakes, handling, etc.)

BERG sells rev limiters that kick in around 5800 rpm for the
T2. I do not think BERG would sell a product that would let
you over rev your engine, do you?

I really don't care if you believe it or not, but it is
true. You can not drive a stock vw in 4th gear beyond the
safe rpm limit.

Douglas
