Subject: thanksgiving &amp; my mom

i drove my sunroof out to my mom's place to leave it for the winter.  she seems to enjoy having a volkswagen at her place.  when i talk to her she is always sure to tell me that &quot;[my] baby is safe and dry.&quot;  so i parked the beetle and came in for thanksgiving dinner.  after saying grace which she ended with an &quot;adios&quot; to the lord and eating, we took stroll around the yard checking out the plants and trees, what was new, what had died, what had returned.  we went back inside to have desert and then it was time for her to drive me back home.  on the way back we talked about family, friends and volkswagens.  as we neared my house i asked her if she'd like to see the newly reupholstered seat in my single cab and go for a drive.  of course she did!  i think the truck is her favorite volkswagen.  she climbed in while i felt bad for running the extra tall tires and her being all geriatric and stuff.  i should get a &quot;mom step&quot; or something.  while i backed the truck down the drive, she addressed it:  &quot;oh zeb (her name for my truck), you handsome dog!&quot;  i had to bite my lip to keep from laughing!  we drove around town taking in the beauty of the area, which according to my mom included the vehicle we were traveling in.  i suppose of all the things i've got to be thankful for, what should head up that list is my mom and her tremendous support for my... hang-up.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
