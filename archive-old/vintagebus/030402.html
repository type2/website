&gt;&gt; should check out the UK based '51 Standard on Everett's site.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;hehe, just found this a little ironic.. vw relics have prolly 'just' got

I think most of the UK Barndoors seem to come out of Finland, Sweden, those

Note the LHD, left-hand doors setup on the aforementioned '51 Standard.
