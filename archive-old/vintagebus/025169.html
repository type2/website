&gt; Sorry of it seem like I'm Pimping the Bus Depot. But Ron is having a problem
&gt; we would all love to have. From what he has told me he's growing fast (it's
&gt; because of his price's and service). but is having a hard time finding good
&gt; help. Hang with him he's a good VW guy trying to do the right thing. I bought
&gt; most of the resto stuff for my 66 from him and saved a lot of $$.

I have to echo this response re: Ron Salmon and Bus Depot.
My job requires me to answer questions most of the day on the phone, and
sometimes it can be really difficult knowing exactly what someone is
talking about. I found out today that there are four different grommets
that go between the body and the wiper assembly on bugs, and the
customer on the phone was incredulous that I couldn't get him a price
quick when he wasnt even sure whether his was a super beetle or
standard.  I have unwittingly become something of an expert on
watercooled vw and audi door handles, but it wasn't overnight. It was
after many many times of looking up part numbers, figuring out what
years the split happened, what the number supercedes to on update, etc
etc etc...
The there are the cases of outright misunderstandings, due to jargon or
differences in part names. I once ordered a transmission when someone
actually wanted a steering gear box. The customer asked for a &quot;gear box&quot;
for a 69 bug, and I willingly ordered him one. I told him the price
(rebuilt) and that he would have to provide his old one as a core. He
was someone I knew to be compitent to do the job of installing a trans
in a bug, so I thought nothing of it, and he didn't balk at the price.
Imagine my suprise when he plunked down a steering gear on my counter as
core, and I had my outside tranny builder working on building a
transaxle.
Oooops!

So anyways, have a little patience with anyone on the phone, and be very
ready to describe intricately what you need, why, and have part numbers
ready if possible. Ron Salmon is one of the better you will deal with.
You may have gotten someone who is learning, and will sometime soon be
much better at what he does, or you may have had someone on a bad day.
None of us was born knowing any of this. We all had to learn somehow,
and from someone who knew more than we, and took some patience and
showed us...
