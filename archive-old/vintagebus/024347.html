Jason,

You put both gaskets in didn't you?  Gasket, strainer, gasket, plate, copper
washers on the studs etc.

Oil type?  Dallas?  30 weight Castrol, Valvoline, Havoline.  Any name brand 30
weight HD oil.  I personally run 30 weight until the temps start dropping below
freezing.  Then I run multi-grades.  Above freezing  30 HD.

&gt; I changed the oil in my 65 Splittie (once again, first time) and bought a
&gt; new oil screen with gaskets.  When I put the new gaskets and oil screen in
&gt; and tightened it down, and added the oil, it started leaking around the
&gt; seal..... &lt;snip&gt; recommended Castrol GTX 10W/30, but he doesnt know anything
&gt; about VW's.
