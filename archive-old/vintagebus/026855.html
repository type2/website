&gt; My 67 has an after market emblem with threaded studs that fasten with wing nuts.
&gt; I used a wire grommet in the hole to help seal out the rain
&gt; 
&gt; My 63 has the original emblem with non threaded studs. I've used a small piece
&gt; of fuel line to fasten it.  But this week I ordered the emblem clips from
&gt; Wolfsburg West, however they don't carry or reproduce the seals, I know that
&gt; there were seals of some sort because remnants still remain stuck in the yellow
&gt; paint.
&gt; 
&gt; what have other people done to deal with this and don't tell me roofing tar.
&gt; 
&gt; for those that live in arid climates and don't know what rain is or what window
&gt; wipers are for pmail me back and I'll send you a photo
&gt; 
&gt; Ty
&gt; 

I want a photo!
Also, any chance of borrowing your digital camera tonight? Doing a
physics project that I need to make a powerpoint presentation from....

Lemme know.
I am headed to Halsey so could drop by your house, or could drop by
HP...
Thanks!
