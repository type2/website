 I recently (about a month ago) replaced the boots that go on the rear axle of
 my '65 Kombi. There is one on each side, transmission side of axle(as opposed
 to wheel side. These were split type boots, lots of little bolts and nuts to
 hlld them together. I don't remember which manual I read regarding their
 installation, but it didn't mention anything about lubrication wiht the 
boots.
 How does this area get lubricated, is it from somewhere else? Did I screw up,
 should i have put some lubrication grease in there?

great that you replaced the boots, as they go bad.  

But whenever replacing the boots it is important to top up the tranny oil.  
or better yet, drain the oil, then replace the boots, then fill it.   You put 
the oil in at the side of the tranny, I think it's the left for tunnel 
trannys with a 17mm allen plug, the right side for split case trannys with a 
19mm outie plug.  Dont forget the RGBoxes!- the oil flows through- connected 
like a habitrail - from center section- axle tubes- reduction gear boxes.
