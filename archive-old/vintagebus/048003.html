Hi Volks,
Not quite.  In 1959 1/2 - 1960 model year the bus engine was bus only.  
Otherwise before and after up to 1971 the engine is the same as bug except 
the muffler and air cleaner.  These two items and the pre-1968 bus type 
engine compartment also made the carb jetting differant from the bug.

&lt;&lt;  The Bus transmission may have slightly different gear ratios but the 
important difference is that the ring gear goes &quot;the other way&quot; (there are 
two ways it can go) on 
 a Bus transmission.  If you stick a stock Bug transmission in a stock split 
Bus, you will have four reverse gears.  The Bus has the reduction gear boxes 
at each rear wheel which the Beetle did not have--or at least the civilian 
Beetles did not have.  &gt;&gt;
  Due to the normal stock bus used a .87 fourth gear also used in the KG 
tranny, just flipping the ring over to the other side in a bug tranny with 
it's .82 fourth gear would result in alot slower bus or higher engine RPM at 
highway speeds.
