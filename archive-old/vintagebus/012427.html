Jack and Kelli arrived around noon on Thursday 3/11/99 in time to have our
otherwise well behaved dog jump all over them. &quot;Does he take commands well
or should I just knee him in the chest?,&quot; Kelli asked. =) Huh? wait while I
decide who's more hyper and distracted- myself or the dog. At least I didnt
pee on the carpet. Wing vents aren't the only critters that get Monkee
wrestled around here... Total momentary chaos. Pooch went out back- I held
my own.
Do we call you Rusty or Jim? er, Jim works fine for me. Rusty is that Nome
de plume smartguy ***hole on the email. An issue for future thearpy I suppose.

We only had enough time to talk a little, show them the '54
Ambulance/camper, take a couple of compromising Polaroids and pass along
appropriate directions to the local FLAPS and Kyle and DeeDee Tillman's
house. A mandatory stop for sure... I had to race off to the job with the
weird schedule.
Nice folks.

Jack passed on the offer to use my computer. Apparently he took the time at
Kyle's. As a heads-up, the word is that J &amp; K will soon be headed toward
Gallup,NM then on to various locales within Colorado and then hopefully will
decend upon the Idaho Bus Pilot's.

Look for the happy travelers at Kelly Park prior to their return to
&quot;reality&quot; and the search for new jobs.
As usual we in Phoenix enjoyed the opportunity to meet up with splittie
warriors. Thanks for stopping! =)

BTW: In spite of the objections, I know for a fact that there are friendly
pig farmers in Oregon.
