&lt;&lt; On that note, does anybody have ideas about a good insulating material for 
heater boxes.  I'm getting ready to re-install mine and I crave maximum 
effeceincy.&gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Find a pair of type 3 heater boxes with the insulation panels on them.  Take 
home and strip one and install one heater box's insulation at a time on one 
of your type 1&amp;2 boxes one at a time so you can use one complete example as a 
visual instruction to install the other.

&lt;&gt;
Best to use the same as VW did with glass cloth wrapped (Availible from your 
local hardware store from the fiberglass repair section!) around the tubes 
with vinyl loosely fastened around.  Though you would do one better to paint 
a very thin coat of tar on the tubing to prevent corrosion especially if you 
drive on salty roads.  Also if you have a wrecking yard nearby with any later 
1970s buses.  Find one that you can get to the underside just forward of the 
tranny nose cone.  There the two heater tubes from the heater boxes meet.  
There should be a nice insulation that is snapped together like a tiny pair 
of shorts around this area.  In the late model bus there is about twice the 
amount of room from the top of this Y-section of heater tube to the underside 
of the cargo floor as compared to the pre-1968 bus.  So a bit of carefull 
pulling and sliding this late model insulation into place is required on 
pre-1968 buses.    Eric&amp;Barb
