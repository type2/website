0.016 = 42 degrees
0.014 = 45 degrees
0.012 = had better be right or I am going to experience one of those
Patsy Cline moments.
Bus doesn't seem to care, running great at all settings. I am sure
there is a point to this, but I've lost it somewhere along the way. I
miss my compufire.
VDO tach is still going nuts, apparently my bus tops out third gear at
7000rpm and cruises in fourth at about 6000rpm. Feels kind of good
actually, I don't see any of them souped-up bugs pulling those kind of
rpms. So maybe I will look at fixing it, but can someone please
suggest to me some good places to stick the thing (in the bus, people,
in the bus).
I hope you are all enjoying a beautiful evening,
Joel and the 1964 Sundial (doing real good despite all confusion)
