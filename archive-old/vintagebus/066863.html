Subject: Nerve shattering noises

All,

At the last swap meet I picked up a handful of OG relays, and also a
buzzer.  Some of those funny-looking one-windshield Buses have them
to let you know when you open the door with the key in the ignition.

Anyway, it's a 111 951 307 A and has &quot;12 Volt&quot; marked on the side.
But it works just fine on 6 V.  I tried it all the way down to 4 V
and it still worked.  Makes a high pitched whine that is fairly
independent of voltage and that Muir called &quot;nerve shattering&quot;.

Might be handy if you have a 6 V Bus and want a noise maker for some
reason - I've heard of people wiring buzzers in parallel with their oil
light for example.

Unfortunately, the OG 12 V regular relays I got don't want to operate
reliably on 6 V.  They need about 8 V or so to work well.
