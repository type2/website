&lt;&lt; I have found the Big 2.5 actually still make or have retooled for some of
the reproduction parts as well as having a group that will license a part
that meets their quality standards.Porsche has a similar progam that they
use for repro parts. &gt;&gt;

VW does license their logos.  We sell floor mats with some of the VW names, 
Jetta, Passat, Golf, Cabriolet, etc., all under license from VWOA.

If you want to offer products with VW trademarks contact VW and work out a 
deal.
