&gt; plugs, and relief valves.  One valve has a groove around the top (pictured
&gt; on the left) and the other one doesn't (right).  Both of mine look like
the
&gt; one one on the right.  Is this correct or so I have a botched OP valve in
my
&gt; engine?

hi nq,

    this is a controversial area that most people, including me, don't
understand or agree on. when i did the motor build tape, clyde berg
specifically told me after-the-fact to not use the grooved o.p. piston
anywhere. however, both my &quot;video mechanic&quot; buddy and rimco said to use the
o.p. kit as it comes from taiwan&lt;vbg&gt;, i.e., one grooved piston and one
not...

    my understanding is that in the old days, the factory didn't supply
grooved o.p. pistons with their engines, but nowdays it could be anything...
right along with cast cranks &amp; flywheels, 7.7:1 compression, and the rest of
the junk you get with an acvw factory mex motor.
