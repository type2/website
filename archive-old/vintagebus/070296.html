Subject: RE: [VB] Only in America

&gt;   The ordeal is almost over, what you ask? Getting a 
&gt; container through customs, that's what. Due to a UNION 
&gt; squabble at the port because the shipping company decided to 
&gt; change piers my container has been held up at the port for 
&gt; over a week. One piers union rep didn't like the fact that 
&gt; the shipping line changed piers with-out UNION approval which 
&gt; created a nightmare at the piers.. Ship moved out of one pier 
&gt; to another then back, a real mess.
&gt;    The irony of this whole deal is I got a break-down on the 
&gt; import duties and  had to pay more duty on 2 westfalia 
&gt; trailer hitchs then I did on my new Firebus, go figire.



I can commiserate with you, Ronnie!  Especially since 9/11, it seems
that getting a container into the U.S. is a huge hassle more often than
it goes smoothly. In fact, of the last 10 or so I've imported, only
one(!) went without a hitch.  (Actually, it literally went without a
hitch, because another customs snafu caused a load of hitches to miss
the conainer, but that's another story.)

First of all, Customs is doing what they call &quot;intense inspections&quot;
randomly on more and more containers ever since 9/11.  I've had the
misfortune of being &quot;randomly selected&quot; about six of the last 10 times.
I'm not sure why Customs would think a container of Volkswagen parts is
a terrorist risk.  Maybe it's because the Libyan terrorists in Back To
The Future drove a VW bus.  Anyway, when they decide to do this, the
cargo must be moved from port to the Customs inspection center, then
offloaded at the direction of Customs, who checks for anything they want
to, from improperly labeled cargo to firearms. They'll go half way
through the container, only to randomly pick a box of brake shoes from
smack in the middle, open it, put an &quot;inspected by U.S. customs&quot; sticker
on it, and then put everything back. This is all done by specially
bonded union labor for $$$$$$$, at my expense, even if Customs doesn't
find anything. (Which they never do. You'd think that after three or
four times of inspecting virtually identical shipments from the same
importer and finding only Volkswagen parts, they'd move on to someone
else, wouldn't you?)  Take a guess at what this costs, double it, and
you can imagine why I groan out loud each time my broker tells me that
my cargo has been randomly chosen for &quot;intense inspection.&quot;

Then there's the Department of Agriculture. (Yes, the Department of
Agriculture.)  I often import a used classic Mini Cooper with my parts,
as they're another hobby of mine. Well, importing soil originating from
certain European countries is illegal due to hoof and mouth disease.
What does this have to do with a car?  Well, a tiny bit of mud might be
imbedded in the tread of the tires or splashed onto the undercarraige of
the car. So yes, the Department of Agriculture gets to inspect any
vehicles coming from designated European countries for this &quot;loose
soil,&quot; which they've done two or three times. Same routine: I pay $$$$
to have the container transported to the Department of Agriculture
inspection site, where they inevitably find some trace amount of mud in
a tire tread (duh!), charge me an extra $200 to fumigate the car, and
release it.  

Of course, it really gets expensive when both Customs _and_ the Dept. of
Agriculture decide they want their hands on the same container, so it
goes from one to the other and I get to pay for both. By the time
they're done, the actual shipping cost of the container seems like a
drop in the bucket.

And then there are all of the steamship related snafus. It seems that
they're constantly inventing new ways to screw up. Just one i that isn't
dotted or one t that isn't crossed and everything grinds to a screeching
hault. My present container missed the vessel and sat at port for an
extra 10 days because the shipping company misplaced a 32-page(!!) fax
of paperwork that had to be with the cargo for it to be loaded. Then
they charged ME a fee for missing the boat!  The time before that, they
forgot to forward a single-page steamship release form to the U.S. port.
Nobody noticed it was missing until the trucker arrived to load the
container and they wouldn't give it to him, sending him back empty
handed (a two hour round trip at Teamsters rates). Guess who paid him
for that wasted trip!  It's gotten to the point that I have to budget
for all of these hassles when I set my prices, because as often as not
some little thing will go wrong that costs big bucks! 

Boy, isn't this fun!  :-)
