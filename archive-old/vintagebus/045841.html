Figure that just for parts if all is not well.

Or....should I do it myself? I've done work in just about all other areas and 
have quite a tool collection, by I may not have all I need for front end 
work. Also, I'm currently lacking a garage, so this would be a driveway job.  
Would the &quot;shimies and shakes&quot; section of Muir be adequate? I don't own a 
Bentley manual - would I need one?&gt;&gt;
Do it yourself as much as possible.  That way you will get to know your bus 
better.  Some things like king &amp; link you will most likely have to send out, 
and the center pin bushing maybe someting to drive to the shop to get 
installed, and reamed.  Get the Bentley!  You will otherwise go a bit nuts 
trying to figure out what he is talking about without photos.  Plus in the 
long run with the proper manual you will save yourself a lot of time, angst, 
and be much safer!   Eric&amp;Barb
