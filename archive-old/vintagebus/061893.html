&gt; can anyone recommend a good product/procedure to
&gt; remove a layer of cheap rattlecan paint without
&gt; harming the original paint underneath? 
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a little body shop secret.  The general public thought we had some 
&gt; miracle liquid for removing graffiti off of there cars............it's 
&gt; called enamel reducer.  If you have a lot of area to remove you maybe have 
to do it a little  at a time.  Keep an  eye on your base coat and rinse well 
with water if you start to notice any clouding.
