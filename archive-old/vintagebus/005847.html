This site is hilarous,even better than eBay.I did not know that barndoors
had dual ports.Kombi's with a rug top and six sky lights.I learned a lot
about &quot;RARE&quot; busses from that site.

&gt; Hi everyone, I just found a site from Japan called Old Car's Market.  I
&gt; recognized quite a few busses for sale on there site and thought people
might
&gt; like to see where and how much their busses are going for when they sell
to
&gt; Japan.  Prices are as expected.  Completely outrageous!!!  Check it out
for
&gt; yourself. http://www.oldcars.co.jp/vw/vw.html  (make sure to do a currency
&gt; conversion of course)
&gt;
&gt; Later,

KM
&gt; speedo)
&gt;    '75 Standard
&gt;    '65 Vespa Allstate
