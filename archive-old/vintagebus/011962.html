&gt; I can't recall offhand the battery compartment dimensions for a
splitty,
&gt; but if it'll fit get a Group 24 size battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Sears usually tries to sell bus and bug owners a so-called &quot;Volkswagen
&gt; battery&quot;, partly because they don't know any better and partly because
&gt; it's usually a more expensive part.

Also because VW specified it as a stock part for both busses and bugs.
 I agree that a Group 24 is a better battery, more capacity, more
plentiful, and generally cheaper.

&gt; As I've written here in the past, a &quot;Volkswagen battery&quot; is barely
&gt; adequate in a bus under good conditions.

I don't really see why, as it is just fine for a Beetle with the same
size engine to crank.  Starter cable lengths are about the same on
both vehicles.

The bus has a longer run to the lighting components in the front, but
that is a question of voltage drop, not battery capacity.  Either size
battery will provide good operation.

&gt; If it'll fit, get a top of the line &quot;Diehard Gold&quot; Group 24 battery
&gt; (they're on sale right now) and smile every time you start your bus or
&gt; turn on the headlights.

When buying batteries, divide the price by the warranty period in
months and buy the battery with the least dollars per month.  I've
found that the battery just below the &quot;top of the line&quot; is usually
give the best life for the money for most makes of battery.  IMO,
Sears batteries are overpriced.  You can do better at any chain FLAPS
such as Pep Boys, Kragen, etc.  I've also had problems with getting
warranties honored at Sears (I changed license plates, so Sears
claimed that the bus wasn't the vehicle in which the battery was
originally installed), but Pep Boys has never given me any problem
(they don't even look at the vehicle).  In fact, once I thought that a
&quot;core&quot; battery was out of warranty but the Pep Boys counter man read
the date code and told me that it was worth $10 in pro-rate!

The warranty becomes more important if you are using a single battery
to provide camping power and engine starting, as this usage is harder
on the battery than straight starting usage.

Now is a good time to think about installing a battery box to protect
your sheet metal from the battery's acid.  Your FLAPS sells plastic
boxes to fit a group 24 battery, and these can easily be installed in
the original battery position.
