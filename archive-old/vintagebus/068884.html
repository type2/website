&gt;Nasty job

Jason had disposable tyvek coveralls, the turkey.  I have a cheap pair of camo pants that never show the grease.  But disposable gloves look better 
all the time.

&gt;Usually bad RGBearings cause rumbles.  A howl is from a bad bearing inside the tranny.

This was sort of like the sound you'd expect to hear just prior to being abducted by aliens.  Actually a little of both.

&gt;Maybe I am cheap, but I have replaced just bad bearings and kept the good ones.

Who lists the bearings separately?

I don't mind a Muldoon myself (I mean, really, what you're talking about is just being economical, not a kluge).  On the other hand I can understand 
the presidential &quot;with us or against us&quot; felt need to replace them all - especially here, when it's something of a PITA to go back later.  If it were *just* 
the two bearings, I think I'd replace them and hope for the best -- since the tranny's going, too, it changes my thinking.

&gt;ring-... I have a nice pair from Matco, that pretty much only see use on trannys.

Thanks for the rec.

&gt;When you get the axle shafts off inspect the ends.

I think Jason said he had some spare FPs - nice tip about using bug ones.  Again, if any of these items are iffy, it's another argument for the 
&quot;complete&quot; rebuilt unit w/RGBs.

&gt;I make RGB half seals from traceing onto paper grocery bags and cutting them out. using a hole punch

Jason described being in the middle of nowhere and making gaskets for a hydraulic system from a Burger King bag!

Thanks for the tips, Clara - this one's a keeper.
