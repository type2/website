My bus I just sold had the bulkhead cut out.  I never drove it, but I 
know the previous did for quite a while and never had issues.  Why they 
cut it out in the first place is beyond me, but I think Eric's egg 
theory might be correct.  Maybe I am just bored too, but I don't see how 
cutting the bulkhead does anything.  I am sure I am wrong here, but oh 
well.  It's Tuesday............
