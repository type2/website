&gt; &lt;&lt;   My 63' bus has a 16DP with a 34 pict 3.  Right now,
&gt; the only return spring for the thottle is the one on
&gt; the carb. It isn't strong enough to fully return the
&gt; pedal.  Should there be an additional return spring
&gt; somewhere?  The original cable was pretty rough, so I
&gt; already replaced it (fully greased ) but it made
&gt; little difference.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; The one spring should be fine- unless you have a extra heavy pedal- like if
&gt; you have that bare foot thing on it.   I do, so I use a spring between the
&gt; upper &amp; lower carb halves, and also between fan housing and carb- the old
&gt; school one on the accelerator cable.  But maybe your spring is just wimpy and
&gt; you need a stronger one.  It should spring back real snappy.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you grease up the linkage by the pedal?
&gt;
 I had this same problem in my 63 DC.  WW showed a little gas pedal
spring/clip like element in their online catalogue, so I ordered 1, but I
couldn't figure out where to install it!!  Finally after the gas pedal broke
off the floor mount, I retrieved an entire pedal assembly of a donor bus,
and lo and behold, There was the spring still in place between the bottom
back of the pedal and the spot welded hinge plate on the bus floor.  It was
rusted, and snapped in half in my hand, but at least I knew where it went,
and installed the new WW clip.  My gas pedal now springs back and salutes
like its on Viagra!!  You learn somethin' every day!
