Thank you to Craig Sauls, I thoroughly enjoyed the pictures.  I'm still
curious what Eric&amp;Barb look like. I'm picturing Eric as the guy  on page
H-7,4 of the Bently 63-67 bus manual , and Barb as the lady in the
original Herbie movie ( when she was working on Herbie.)  Are there any
E&amp;B pictures out there?  Thanks ,

Ever wonder what the faceless entities on this list look like? Ever want
to
know what the wise-ass looks like so you can thump him at the next show?
Put
some faces to the names, I have just uploaded 18 pictures of listees and
buses taken at this years shows. The are at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ ,

Enjoy
