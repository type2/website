Yes there was one available....it is pictured and the tools are described
and parts numbers for each is listed in the VW parts reference manuals,
specifically the '67 edition. My understanding is that the original
manuals are all over the place and only a dime a dozen.  Or maybe a nice
listee will send you a copyied picture of the tool roll bag if you ask
them. :)
later
