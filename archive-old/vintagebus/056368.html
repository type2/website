Subject: Re: [VB] 15&quot; wheels to narrow for todays tires?

211 601 027E  =  15&quot; wheel from chassis no. 20-117902 up to 1 219 510 [about
10/63] is 4.5K  x 15
It is 4 1/2&quot; wide.....
I believe the bug wheel is 4&quot; wide.

&gt; &gt; 25.7 inches in the 195/70/15 size but has a load rating of 1985lbs. But
&gt; &gt; again the narrowest rim they recommend is 5&quot;. I guess my question is are
&gt; &gt; you all ignoring this and running them anyway? Has there been any
&gt; &gt; problems? I hate to go to a 14&quot; wheel but that would get me my minimum
&gt; &gt; 5&quot; width.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Mmmm.  Now, I'm no expert on 15&quot; bus wheels, but i'd swear they were
&gt; at least 5&quot; wide...at least the ones I've seen.  Are you sure you dont
&gt; have bug 15&quot; wheels?
&gt;
&gt; Anyone want to back me up on the correct width of the 15&quot; bus wheel?  I'll
&gt; look in the Bentley when I get home...
&gt;
&gt; (yes. a 4 or 4.5&quot; wheel IS to narrow for a 195 width tire. a 5&quot; is JUST
&gt; big enough to fit in a 195 without problems.)
