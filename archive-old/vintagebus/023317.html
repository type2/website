**************************
Heard this from a knowledgeable bird (On the Noon Balloon From Saskatoon):

Wiring Works is not supplying WCM harnesses any longer.  WCM is &quot;supposed&quot;
to be  making their own, on their own someday, but I've heard these
promises before.  Let's just say their reputation with Wiring Works hasn't
been financially sound for some time now.

Caveat Emptor........
