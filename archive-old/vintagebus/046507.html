better air flow then maybe you should make a second set of covers made out of 
screen to keep the bugs out.

Hi Thomas,
Now that is brilliant!  Especially if one took a magnetic sheet, cut out the 
center to get covered with a screen.  
  We had a friend of ours make for our 1960 panel camper conversion a rear 
hatch screen system much like the 1964 and later VW accessory.  Makes a huge 
differance in hot weather wether you can get some sleep or not when parked.
  Hey Rocky, it might be a good idea to cut the back panel/s of the cabinet/s 
to allow access to the vent covers then!   Eric&amp;Barb
