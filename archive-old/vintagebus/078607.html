Subject: RE: oil temp.

I wonder whether there is a point where the engine temps increase faster
than the oil temp?  When pushed hard, my engine smells a little hot when
I stop for gas (different than normal), even though the oil temp is
within &quot;normal&quot; ranges.  With an added cooler, perhaps the higher
readings are &quot;inaccurate&quot; (low), in relation to increases in head temp.
At a minimum, it seems like there would be a lag.

I have been driving the 23 around the last couple days with the 1885 in
it. The out side temps are in the 100's and I could not get an oil 
temp above 190. I have the oil sender tapped in where a type 3 oil
filler would be, a 92 pass oil cooler (external) with a fan with a 
thermostat that turns the fan on at 185. It does have a Porsche style
fan shroud and no engine mounted cooler.
