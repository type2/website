&gt; What do I need to look at to help me identify a mystery transmission 
found in the back of an old bus I bought?  It has a VW logo and part  #
(have the number at home) but I can't find an explanation of 
Transmission part numbers anywhere.  Peace, John Baker 1971 Westy  1972

I just got this from AA Transaxle ......... maybe it will help you.
Solved my inquiry.

Stan...How many ribs are on the top of the case just behind the bell
hsg???
3 ribs/=69-74 bus     6 ribs=76-79 bus   5 ribs with square sides are a
75 only bus
Other than that, it may be an early bug/bus double side cover trans which
are for all intets &amp; purposes are all the same....
If the nuts on the tranny are silver nylocks, the trans is a rebuild from
Trasform...marginal at best
