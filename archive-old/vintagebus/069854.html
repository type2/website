&gt; I'll tell you another one that gave me pause. A friend of mine years ago
&gt; hooked up a pair of internal scoops, aluminum dryer hose, and a bug vent fan
&gt; and tried forcing more cooling air to the fan shroud. He could actually see
&gt; the head and oil temp drop on his dash when he cranked up the speed on the
&gt; fan. A little too busy in the engine compartment for me!

What was the condition of his engine seals?  I'd expect that this approach
would result in lower temps if it was replacing hot recirculated air with
cooler outside air, but if the seals were in good shape it wouldn't make
much difference.
