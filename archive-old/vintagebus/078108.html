Subject: Burnt bus fund reachs 2000 dollars

  I almost broke out in tears when I read this, what a bus community

quote     &quot;have loved VW's since my teen years back in the
70's and love driving/working on VW's in general and buses in particular
since then.  I am also blessed with the financial resources to continue
this hobby.  That being said, I would like to anonomously donate $1,000
to the bus fund for Chris&quot;

This absolutley blew my mind and we now have over 2000 dollars to find Chris
a nice bus or a cheap one and the money to make road worthy. I can not say
enough of the bus community.

At BBB there was a pretty clean 70 pop top westy for 1500 dollars. I think I
will check it out more thourohly and check with her and others to see if
it's worth it.


ronnie    burnt bus fund manager

ps. I have had request for a pay-pal account which I do not have or want to
hassel setting up. Money orders work fine contact for who to make them out
to

thanks to all who contributed
