&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, I'm amazed that it took the Euros so long to figure out that
their governments are gouging them on fuel taxes and to do something
about it. Seems that a couple of hundred years ago a group of Americans
became similarly annoyed about taxes and dropped a fair amount of tea into
Boston harbor.  Perhaps the French, Belgians, and Brits will follow the
tradition!&lt;&lt;&lt;

OK so let's not kill the fish by dumping fuel in the ocean! LOL!!! But really 
I don't think there is anything that we can do. I mean if the Government 
wanted to say Taxes on cigarettes are going up and no one did anything about 
it then why would they think that any one would rebel on the taxes on fuel? 
(just a thought)!
