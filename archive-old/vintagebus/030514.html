Subject: Re: OTP WTB: 5 string banjo

I have two 5 string banjos, but you can't have 'em.  I play an 
appalachian style of music sometimes called &quot;Old Time&quot; music, and play 
the banjo in the &quot;clawhammer&quot; style.  I started learning the banjo in 
the mid 70's and have since learned to play the fiddle, guitar, mandolin 
and bass.  My wife (who plays the fiddle) and I and others in the area 
have a band that regularly plays for square dances, but mostly we get 
together to play just for our own enjoyment.  We frequently use our 71 
Westy on music campouts, so VWs and Old Time music go together rather 
well for us.  The bus has made the trip from Philly to the Clifftop 
festival in southern West Virginia for the last 15 years or so (and it's 
been reliable, although not entirely without incident).  Used to be alot 
of buses there, but last year I think we were the only one. You are 
lucky to have a musical tradition in your family.  I had to start from 
scratch.  I did have the good fortune to learn from some of the old 
master musicians, before they passed on.  You should try to get your 
Grandpa to show you some stuff, before it's too late.

&gt; No this isn't a post about the petri banjo steering wheel. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Last night I went to my grandparent's house and Grandpa dug out his banjo.
&gt; In about an hour I was playing chords and playing stuff that my grandpa has
&gt; never played before.  I found it rather easy compared to guitar and since I
&gt; like bluegrass type music anyway (amongst other music), I was just curiouis
&gt; if anyone on the list had a 5 string banjo they don't play, can't play, and
&gt; would like to sell or trade for VW parts.  I thought I would ask because I
&gt; want to learn to play it.  I never knew a damn banjo could be so much fun!
&gt; :-)  Goes good with my overalls and corn-cob pipe really well.
