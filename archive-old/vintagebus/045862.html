&lt;&lt; Can any of you identification Guru's help me out there?
 I recently purchased what I beleive is a 1967 bus.
 The chassis No is 237084098 which does not seem to be in any of the lists
--------------------
the first three numbers:
2- means its a type 2 (transporter, but you knew that)
3- kombis- commercial model came with hardboard panels in front, none in 
rear, 99% probability it was one colour, three windows each side behind cab 
doors
7- 67 model year

084098 it the serial number part of the vin- a fairly early 67 you have.

look behind the passnger seat for the M code tag and decode it on Thoms 
webpage.

////////////////////////////////////
 I've been able to find.Has just one set of popouts at the rear,and no rear
 seating.
 I live in Australia ,perhaps different numbers for export?
 The engine which I am sure is out a bug (1600cc?) has another number that
 doesn't seem to correspond with anything .It is  AR087443............
 
 Hope someone can help
 
 Cheers
 
 Phil
