Hi Steve,
Make sure to only drive that engine in town kind of driving not up and flying 
at a constant high speed on the highway!  Things are going to try to polish 
up which will release heat and a huge amount of sludge from the old oil and 
corrosion of the engine case.    Best to install a full flow filter.  Also 
keep trips to 15 to 30 minutes and change oil every 50 or less miles for at 
least the first 300 miles or until the oil stops turning black in much less 
than 500 miles.  Otherwise the sludge if heated up enough will avalanche 
loose and clog the oil cooler and even the oil passages to the bearings.
Good Luck,
Eric&amp;Barb
