Subject: pop-out window to glass seals

I seem to have two different kind of pop-out glass to frame seals. I had 
some lying around I think i got at a swap meet. these fit perfectly. But the 
ones I ordered recently seem way too small. i can't get the frame all the 
way on because they are too small. Am i doing something wrong or is this not 
the correct seal for what i need? another words, do they make two different 
kinds of these seals?
thanks
john
