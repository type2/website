thank you Jeff, that's a beautiful thought.
I think it deserves a home and some attention, shortened though it is.
The thought of going around corners in it is a little scary, I need
those testing wheels like they use for SUV slalom tests.
If I am able to strike a deal for the bus I will &quot;go the distance&quot; and
show it, but probably trailer it to the event.
