Subject: Re: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

   So if all DC's had suicide rear doors , would a right hand drive Binz have a
 door that opens the normal way being they wer suicide when left hand drive?
 Has anyone ever seen a right hand drive Binz?

&gt;&gt; I think it's more the door frame that's the &quot;standard&quot; part, though don't 
&gt;&gt; early RHD cargo doors have the handle on the rear door, too, Rob?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The RHD Bay Double cabs have &quot;normal&quot; left side rear doors, and I THINK 
&gt;&gt; that the post '64 RHD DCs had &quot;normal&quot; rear doors, but I can't be certain 
&gt;&gt; of that.
&gt;
&gt;All splitty RHD DC's had suicide doors, regardless of the year. The door is 
&gt;the same as the LHD version so since its rhd and the loading door is put on 
&gt;the left, they used all the same equipment except for the B &amp; C pillar and 
&gt;rocker of course. Just a flipped door.
