Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing r.box core plugs

Sealant is good in this place

sometimes they get a bit bent.   A new one might work better, or take it off 
teh spring plate, clean the box and spring plate up, use LOTS of sealant and 
bolt it back on.

Those plugs are annoying  &lt;%^#^&gt;

liquid gasket around the second before I put it in.  The first leaks the 
second doesn't  Should I have used sealant anyway or do you think the 
leak was just coincidence ? or should I get a new one ?

thanks all.
