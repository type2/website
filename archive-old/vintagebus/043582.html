&gt;Ok, I've got a 12V 67 wiper motor.

This may help you understand what's going on.  This is based on something
I wrote for F_at_rd wiper motors but by looking at the '67 Bus wiring diagram
and the Bosch terminal designations it makes sense for the VW too.  This
may not be 100% correct but it's as close as I can come without actually
taking a voltmeter to a working, stock '67.

The motor is usually grounded all the time, through the mounting bolts.
For a two-speed motor, there are at least two wires coming out...one for
high speed and one for low.  On the VW, these are 53, black, and 53b,
black/yellow stripe.  Apply +12v to either of these wires and you get
the corresponding speed.  However, the wipers will stop dead right when
you turn the switch off (no park action).  This is probably the way the
PO's switch works.

To get the park action, you have to arrange for the motor to still get
power from the time that you turn the dash switch off until the time that
the blades are parked.  This is done by a switch that is operated by a
cam inside the wiper motor.  This switch has one contact with an 
always-hot feed from inside the car (53a, black/gray stripe), one
contact that is grounded, and a wiper (moving part) that is connected
to the brown wire (31b) to send a signal back to the wiper switch: 
+12v when not parked, ground when parked.

The wiper switch has to be a little bit special too.  Half of it does
what you expect...connects +12v to nothing in &quot;Off&quot;, to the low speed
wire in &quot;Low&quot;, and to the high speed wire in &quot;High&quot;.  If all you had
was this half, again, you'd just get two speeds and no park action.
(This is probably what you have now with the switch the PO installed).
The other half of the switch works with the park switch in the wiper
to give you the park action.  In the &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High&quot; positions, it
doesn't connect anything.  In the &quot;Off&quot; position, it connects the low
speed wire from the motor (53) and the &quot;signal&quot; wire from the park
switch (31b).  This makes it so when you turn the switch &quot;Off&quot;, the
park switch in the wiper motor feeds +12v through the dash switch
into the low speed wire to keep the motor turning.  When the blades
park, the park switch opens, cuts off the voltage, and the motor stops.

&gt;It has 3 wires plus ground.

No, it has 4 wires plus ground.  The case/bracket is ground, and
that brown wire operates in conjunction with the wiper switch to
give you the parking action.  You will probably find that if
you hook 12 volts to the plain black wire (53) and ground the
wiper motor case/bracket, the wipers will run at low speed.  If
no other wires from the motor are connected to anything, you
should measure no voltage between 53a/ground, 31b/ground, or
53a/31b.  If this checks out, switch your meter to &quot;ohms&quot; and
measure between 31b and ground while the wipers are running.  You
should find that it is open circuit (infinite resistance) for most
of the wiper sweep, dropping to nearly zero resistance when the
wipers are in their &quot;park&quot; position.  Now measure between 53a
and 31b with your ohm-meter and you should get exactly the opposite -
zero resistance for most of the wiper sweep, opening up briefly
while the wires pass through the park position.  If this is
what you have, then your motor checks out OK.  Don't do the
ohm-meter checks unless you measure zero voltage across
53a/ground, 31b/ground, and 53a/31b or you might fry your ohm-meter.

You will have to put in a '67 switch if you want the two speed plus
park action.  You cannot get it with the PO's toggle switch or with
the '63's original switch for the single speed motor.

&gt;Right now, everything works except the rear blinkers. But I don't 
&gt;think the rear blinkers are hooked up at all.

That's a whole 'nother ball of wax.  If the brake lights work in back,
then the turn signals back there should work too.

Good luck!
