Subject: Re: [VB] clutch cable woes

Hi All-

Went out and had a look. By bowden tube I assume evreyone is referring to
the rubber tube that is attached to the end of the metal clutch line?

Aside from the fact that there is very little  space in which to get at this
tube (tranny and all in the way)- how should I remove this? From the back
(where the wing nut is) or at the other end? I don't want to make the
problem any wosre so ask questions before I do anything :)

Thanks again

M.

&gt; Michael,
&gt; Sometimes it just goes this way.  I had the same problem a couple weeks
&gt; ago.  You are probably going to have to take the bowden tube off.  Be
&gt; careful, they are easy to kink.  Make sure it is still lined up witht the
&gt; body tube before pulling.  If it's not it won't go through either.
&gt; You might be able to clearance the bowden tube inside some.
