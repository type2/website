Creative Engineering, the folks that brought you very nice but pricey
safari reproductions has now started selling repro bus racks.  Two leg
and three leg Westy look alikes.  295 and 375 I think....but don't
forget to do the conversion.  The prices are in pounds sterling...its
England my good chap.

Check it out.
