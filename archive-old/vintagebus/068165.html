Subject: PP surface rust

I'm putting a clutch back on a motor I am finishing freshening up (new
seals, checking etc..) and the pressure plate has some spots of surface
rust (as does the fly wheel) I'm a bit concerned with.  Granted its not
deep or flaking or in any way damaging the parts, but it is there. 
Should I take a 3m Roloc pad to it to knock it off or will that light
scratching be a problem.  

This motor sat un used in a (pardon the profanity) type 3 for over 20
years, and I don't think the motor ever moved or had the clutch
activated.  Will the rust be removed the first time I use the clutch??

Thanks.

Steve
