Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Air conditioning

The new A/C compressors that are used in our kit are the rotary style. Now
what used to draw 5-7 HP with the old piston style compressor, only draws 2
HP.

No problems.

&gt; Basically, feeding 1 hp into a perfectly efficient air conditioner yields
&gt; about 2500 Btu/hr of cooling.  The original dealer-installed AC was
&gt; probably around 12,000 Btu/hr, which means it took at least around 5 hp
&gt; to drive it.  The Type IV engine will probably have power to spare, but
&gt; it's something you may want to be aware of.
