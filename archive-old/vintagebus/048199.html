&lt;  Ever try to explain the
 appeal of driving an old bus to friends or co-workers?  I know many of us
 have faced those bewildered looks and snickers, and joke about old VW's at
 work.  Maybe even from parents or family.   Some people just don't have the
 capacity to understand  &gt;&gt;
Yup-  and the only thing I can ever think to say is &quot;You have to drive it&quot;,
which usually gets about a 1 % response.... but thats okay too.

Its funny i almost always get the guy in his 40's eyes glassed over
remembering his bus look. Its seem almost everyone has a bus story lurking in
there past. I have to admit I love hearing them.
