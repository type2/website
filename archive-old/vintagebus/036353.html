&gt; I have this on the tag in my 61. It is for codes L346 and
&gt; L347, or Seagull grey and Mango Green. I believe that this colour
&gt; combination was introduced in late 1959 and was used until mid 1961.
The
&gt; matching upholstery is Caramel Brown
&gt; There is a photo of  my van showing these colours at my Bad Camberg
photo
&gt; page

&gt; glen, my 1959 standard microbus was mfg.  1-20-59 &amp; has this color
combo. so i quess the colors were introduced in late 1958 unless
someone else has any more info. thanks for the color codes though.
