&gt;  buy new german bearings.  take it to a machine shop
&gt; and have them pressed in properly.




Just being nit picky, but people should not be needing to press the bearing in
or out.  The races, yes.  The actual bearings themselves, no.  You don't  really
need to have someone press them (races) in.  You can do that with a special tool
(bearing race/ seal installer from Eastwood) and a hammer.
