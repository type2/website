Glen (and the List),

Consider buying two fire extringuishers of the dry-powder type, each of 15 lb
capacity.  Carry one in the cockpit, where you can reach it immediately.
Carry the other in the cargo bay.

When you buy your extinguisher make sure it can be re-charged and take the
trouble to determine who can do the recharging and how much it costs.  Here in
southern California you can get a 15 lb extinguisher re-charged for about five
dollars.  This should be done at least ONCE A YEAR.

Plan on replacing all of your rubber fuel hoses every two years.  Yeah,
they'll last a lot longer.  But in replacing them you will be forced to do a
careful inspection of the entire fuel system.  And the cost of a few feet of
hose is a lot less than the cost of replacing your bus.

Do NOT install a fuel-filter in the engine compartment between the fuel pump
and the carburetor.

Each time you change your oil, inspect the area where the fuel pipe passes
through the forward breast-tin.  If you have not installed a bulkhead fitting,
consider doing so.  You may also wish to consider installation of a fuel shut-
off valve at the outlet of the fuel tank.  Electric or manual types are
available.

If you have never fought a gasoline fire with a dry-type extinguisher, you
might consider doing so... and using the opportunity to teach the technique to
anyone who regularly rides in your vehicle. (Hint:  The safety pin on some
extinguishers takes a lot of force to remove.  A drop of oil would not be out
of place if you want to make sure your wife or child can actuate the
extinguisher.)  A re-charge is relatively inexpensive and when it comes to
fire-fighting there's really no substitute for experience.  Your local fire
station may be willing to assist you in this effort.  If not, get yourself a
metal oil-drain pan, put a little gasoline in it, ignite the gasoline FROM A
SAFE DISTANCE and do what comes naturally.

The second most important lesson in knowing how to fight a gasoline fire is
KNOWING WHEN TO QUIT -- when to get the hell out of the way and let it burn.
I'll leave you to deal with that aspect of the problem.

Volkswagens don't have to catch fire.  The first VW-related message I uploaded
to the internet had to do with preventing engine fires in Volkswagens.  It
seems a shame that five years later bugs and buses are still going up in
flames for the same preventable reasons.
