 &lt;&lt; Should one heat up the transmission before changing the oil, You know
  drive it for a couple of miles? &gt;&gt;
 Hi Meredith,
 Well it is more of driving it till all the crud in there should be stirred 
up 
 which happens to warm up the oil and tranny case due the friction of the 
 gears and stirring of the oil itself.  A good 30 minutes on a regularly 
 driven tranny.  On an unknown or new or just rebuilt tranny make sure to 
 change it again at 1,000 miles and then every 20,000 miles thereafter.

with a mystery trans I change it ASAP.  If it was dirty, I try to scoop the 
slime out from the drain holes with my pinky.   I change it then in 300 
miles, then 1000 miles intervals till it comes out clean.  Some times it 
takes a few changes.

Then again, tranny oil doesn't get dirty very quick.  When I changed the 
tranny oil for the second time in my bug (it was a 30K interval, about 5 
years), it came out clean, magnets looked good too, just a couple bits 
sticking to them.   So if it is dirty, you are really cleaning thestuff out 
of there, and that will make it drive a lot smoother and quieter and even 
last longer.
