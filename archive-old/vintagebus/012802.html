Subject: The Oil Filter, PIA or Flak Helmet?
Message-Id: &lt;199905011524.IAA20381_at_quantum.digital-galaxy_dot_net&gt;

I vaguely recall writing a post about the oil pump .
but I don't think I ever did anything on that filter
down in the bottom of the sump on the oil pickup tube.

It's just a filter  . . right? . .  no no n o . . . . :-)

It looks like a hat upside down . . it's a flak helmet
for the oil system . . the heart of the engine . .

We used to sit on our helmets when we rode in the
helicopters . . it's down there in the bottom of
the case . . .

I don't know if that makes any sense to a woman . .

Women probably keep their helmets on  . . . it's sensible

I'm working without a net here . .  :-)

Here's a theoretical happening :  a piece of skirt off
a piston pops off . . it happens . .

You took the filter out so it gets sucked right up the
pipe to the pump . .

This pump is a positive displacement gear  pump . .
the oil is trapped around the outer wall of the housing
in the gear teeth and then is squeezed out where the
teeth mesh together in the middle . . steel on steel teeth

You get that piece of skirt trapped in those gear teeth
and something has to stop . . .

The drive-shaft for the gear pump is a press fit but in
a couple of turns after the gears stop, the shaft will
weld itself to the gear . .

Then the tang on the shaft where it fits into the end
of the camshaft has to give . . .

While it is giving . . it tweeks the timing gear sideways
into the crank gear . . .

None of this may matter since you've been out of oil
since the teeth got jammed . .

Doom on you . . the whole right butt-cheek of the engine
falls off . .   :-)

Notice that all of the above can happpen with a full-flow
filter and cow magnets or magnetic plug in sump . .

The filter is after the pump . . the magnet can't stop
a non-magnetic piece of aluminum . .

Notice this would have been a ho-hum day if the screen . .

If you look at Detroit . . they  use the same kind of
pump . . but they weld the screen over the end of the
pickup tube . .

So by all means do the full-flow, and quit changing the
sump screen  . . but leave it in there . .

Magnets on the sump plate are good . . I'll go you one
better . . put a magnet on the bottom of your FF filter
can . . a nice super magnet . .

It's theorized that most steel in oil came from pump in
first place . . then goes to filter can and is held there
by magnet . . never goes thru bearings . .

If you haven't done this screen change yet, be advised
there are several sizes of pickup tubes . . here's a
case where you want to take your case number and get the
year of it, then go get that year filter . .



The Tale: (old guys have lots of tales)

Our hero or victim is riding in a helicopter and the sergeant
takes off his flak helmet and sits on it . . . . .

This all has to do with the concept that ground fire comes from
the ground . . . while military intelligence is still debating
the issue, it has found favor among the grunts . . .

There is some sort of &quot;Man&quot; thing that makes it acceptable to
worry about the family jewels, which is why we are sitting on
these helmets, a shot somewhere else is not to be considered,
after all we are immortal . . . . :-)

New Guy wants to know what if he gets shot in the head . . .

Sergeants are like Group Leaders of sales teams . . .  :-)

They must be ever alert for the first sign of negativity from any
member of the team and move quickly to comfort and revitalize the
moral of this young man with all the sensitivity and compassion
a sergeant is capable of while at the same time re-assuring the
other members of the team . . .

&quot;Ladies&quot; . . . he actually used several more colorful sobriquets,
it represented the same type of familiarity . . :-)

  &quot;If you are shot in the head, statistics say it will be fatal
and you will not bother me any more&quot;. . .

 &quot;If you are shot in the ass, the corpsman is not a faggot and will
derive no pleasure from looking at your no doubt fine ass, it will
piss him off and he will complain to me . . . now I have to look at
your ass and listen to you whine, and the corpsman bitch and I'm
going to get pissed, you do not want me and the corpsman pissed at
you so take the shot in the head&quot; . . .

We all feel much better for that pep-talk, even New Guy
is grinning. . . . . .   :-)
