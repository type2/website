What is the collective wisdom of having two cans of
fuel sitting that close to the engine? Closed, sealed
and properly secured containers as noted on their web
site. All the same it would make me feel a tad
nervous. Then again traveling south of Tucson, AZ
makes me nervous. Running out of gas miles
&lt;kilometers&gt; from nowhere is also an option...
With my luck I'd run out of gas or drop a shift
coupler and soon be strapped to a heavy wooden chair
in a remote shanty shack in the middle of the Mexican
desert surrounded by psychotic/sociopathic Federales
screaming in Spanish about missing money and drugs as
they are busy pulling my teeth out one by juan with
rusty pliers and attaching jumper cables on my
testicles. Broken windows and missing sections from
the roof with Sonoran sun streaming in like a laser
beam with only the sound of hot wind and screaming for
miles. A toothless, drunken and retarded version of
Antonio Banderas laughing in the background and
restraping his belt as he comes out of an adjacent
room containing my wife and daughter.
Oh man! I'd rather explore Canada and Alaska. At least
I could understand the screaming &lt;as long as I avoided
the Japanese who now own Alberta&gt; and greater chance
that the beer would be cold. ;-) Oh, Canada!

Now that I think about it- that description sounds
like my job at Boeing or a weekend working on the
raffle bus at Kyle's ...
