Mystery is right! I pulled the engine on my truck last night to change the
generator (need brushes for the old one) and starter. While I was down there
and noticed some peeling on one of the cross beams forward of the torsion bar.
I picked at it with a screw driver thinking it was some undercoating or
something and it was the rusted metal itself. Out pours all this dirty sand
like in one of those old Egyptian movies in the tombs! It looks like a lot of
cross beams and runners are bad and also the dog legs. I haven't had an intact
jack point since I bought this truck. Well, that's not entirely true, the PO
did include the new jack points and side panels (whatever they are called),
under the treasure chest doors.

most of us(like myself) got
our buses late in their lives(mine was over thirty when I got it) so there
are tons of mysteries in there...
