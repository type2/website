Subject: Re: [VB] Installing a radio

I slid a saphire IX from a 69 westy into my 67 dash
and it fit great! It had a spring tab on each side so
when you push it in from the top of the dash (tight
fit, the body is about the same size as the 67 hole)
it slides down and right as the face plate touches the
dash - CLICK! I had it in my bus for a couple of
months before I sold the Westy and had to put it back
in there. So, if the tabs are still there it should go
right in with no adapter. And Bob, if it does, wanna
sell me the adapter? (I need one to put a 67 blaupunkt
Frankfurt in my 67 deluxe. Anyone else? Anyone?)

Eccch!)

 Of course, it is a Sapphire IX.

 Hi Bob,
OK!  That's the problem.  Your bus should have a
Sapphire III or IV or  several other makes of radios
of the time.  Sapphire IX would be for the mid  1970s
VWs.
