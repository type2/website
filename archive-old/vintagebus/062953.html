Subject: STOLEN SAFARIS - TUCSON AZ


TO ALL THE HONEST VW ENTHUSIAST IN THE TUCSON AREA - I HAD MY SAFARIS
STOLEN LAST NIGHT FROM MY HOME  N. TUSCON BLVD.  THEY WERE BUS
BOYS REPRODUCTIONS THAT HAD BEEN PAINTED A BLUE/GREEN (ORIGINAL 1965
COLOR).   MOST LIKELY SOME SCUMBAG WILL BE TRYING TO HAWK THEM OR PUT
THEM INTO IT'S TYPE 2.  IT (SCUMBAG) WILL BE TRYING TO LOCATE WELD TABS
AND LATCHES, SO IF SOMEONE COMES TO YOU LOOKING FOR THESE PARTS OR
SELLING PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL _at_ 520-322-8188 AND I SHALL STICK AN AXLE
SHAFT UP THERE WAZOOO.

THANKS,
  ROBERT EAST

PROUD OWNER OF A 1965 TYPE 2 KOMBI &amp; A 1963 DOUBLE CAB
