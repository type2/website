Subject: BN2 - Questions

So I picked up a BN2 - it looks very nice but we'll see.  Can anyone
tell me from what vehicle  these come.  And how different are these from
a BN4?  I'm hoping I can put it in my bus.  It seems complete with fuel
pump and filter but it does lack a switch - I suppose there are lots o'
switchs that would work.

BTW - the person from whom I bought this also has this big army green
heater that he says it is a VW heater 40's? I have no idea but that's
what he says.  It vaguely looks like a BN bit is about 3 times the
size.  It is in very good shape - at least from the glance that I took.

TIA
