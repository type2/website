Damn, well with all that 20$ a pop for entrance fees, Im sure they can swing 
it.
I'm pretty sure with only admitting show cars the revenue will decrese like 
10 fold.
I doubt they can afford a classy place like KP without jacking the show car 
price WAY up.
I think Ill hit the red barn show and go home saturday night.

&gt;Leave the park for the show and vendors.  Problem solved.  How many of you

That'd be great if Kelley Park and the parking lot were actually ran by the
same people!  Sounds crazy, but it's true.  The Golden Gate Chapter's
already looked into that one.
