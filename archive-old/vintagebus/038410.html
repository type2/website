Subject: TOB and driveshaft sleeve, '65 engine install

Alright, we will try this another way.

Here is the problem, in a 1965 Crew with swing axle and redux boxes:
  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/trans_TOB01.jpg

I've only seen this type of TOB -- with the &quot;clips&quot; and the sleeve over the
driveshaft, on 1971+ bugs and bus.

For reference,  pn 1970 and down, I see this type (photo taken from a 1970
IRS bus):
  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/trans_TOB03.jpg

So, now I'm looking to get confirmation that the TOB &quot;should be&quot; like the
second picture (like I have in my 1970 bus) and that the one in this 1965
Crew must have been replaced by a PO using after market parts?  Updated to
the 1971 and later design?

Does this make sense to anyone?
