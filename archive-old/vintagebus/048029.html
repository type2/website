&lt;&lt; As you all seem to be the experts on tar, I thought I should ask you 
directly.&gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Okay shoot!
 
&lt;&gt;
 Right a messy job, but once you are done you and your bus will be much 
happier.  The higher the speed the more the air in front of the bus is at a 
higher pressure than inside of the VW and so the water is pushed into the 
interior.

&lt;&lt;The PO told me the bus had been sitting for about 8 years, the front 
windshield seal had dried and cracked. Thereby letting water leak in through 
the front, and down to my floor pans(which were pretty rusty).
 He put new seals, but i don't think he did anything to compbat the rust. So 
this past weekend, I cut out the seals, and took out the glass. Then scraped, 
and ground out the rust. Covereed with two coats of Corroless, a rust 
stabilizer I have heard a lot ofo good things about. I then put some JB weld 
in to try and smoothe out the bumbs. I am going to be sanding that down 
tonight, hoping to get a nice smooth finish(hopefully).&gt;&gt;
We rather distrust rust converters.  They might convert the top layer, but 
any deep pockets will still be there lurking for thier chance to break out.  
We prefer to wire brush, sand and then apply Naval Jelly from the local 
hardware store to acid out the rust.  Just apply it then cover with plastic 
wrap that you use in you kitchen to cover food, this keeps the Naval Jelly 
&gt;from drying out while you let it do it's thing overnight.  Then just scrape 
off the the Naval Jelly and wipe off the area to see how it did.  If 
necessary repeat the wire wheel, sanding and acid again until all of the rust 
is gone.  Then apply a high zinc content primer with more than 85% zinc 
content (NAPA high zinc content primer works great!) one or two coats and 
then body puddy and paint a couple of coats.
 
&lt;&lt;Anyway, when I put the seals and glass back in, I plan on using some KY 
jelly I think(to help the string slide around the seal.  Now my question is 
about the tar. Where and when should I be putting the tar in? Does the 
lubricant I put on the seal to help install the seal interfere with tthe 
tar's adhesion? And what type fo tar, something that comes in a chaulking 
gun? &gt;&gt;
Just us the tar as a lubricant.  We paint the window frame with tar.  Use a 
condiment container from your local super market that has the pull off tip 
cover, not the screw open/close type.  To apply a bead of tar in the seal 
where the glass goes.  Then mount the seal around the glass.  You can use 
either a medium sized automotive wire, or non-edged weed eater line to wrap 
in the outer groove of the window seal and make sure to loosely knot it at 
the bottom center of the window.  Then have a friend help you put the window 
in place while you make sure the wire or weed eater line ends are inside with 
you.  The friend should press gently with spread out hands and fingers on the 
glass.  While you inside untie the ends of the wire or weed eater line and 
pull here and there to keep the ends somewhat even as you pull the rubber lip 
of the seal up and over the frame of the body.  When finished pulling in the 
seal clean the excess tar off with kerosene or orange derivitive non-abrasive 
degreaser.  Though be carefull with these chemicals on paint that is less 
than three weeks old they might remove it.  We tend to leave the tar on the 
paint for those weeks and then remove it after that amount of time to avoid 
this problem.  Have heard reports that sometimes the tar stains light colored 
paint.  In the instances of real nice buses then one could use the condiment 
container to get a bead of tar under the seal with a screwdriver to carfully 
lift the seal edge.  The only problem with this on the pre-1968 bus is the 
overhang over the front windshields tends to make this impossible so you 
might have to at least paint the upper frame areas to avoid this problem.  
Then use the condiment container for the lower areas.   Eric&amp;Barb
