Subject: Protractor-toting-torsion-bar guru needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm in the final stages (I pray) of raising a lowered bus to its stock 
height. The front springs are in the front torsion tube and I've adjusted the 
rears 3 times now. It's been hard getting the splines on both sides adjusted 
so both sides are equal. I now have the right side about one spline away from 
level from front to back. But the left side needs to match up.

Here's the plan:

I'm thinking about raising the right one more spline and using it for 
reference for the left. I'll take a protractor and measure the right side's 
spring plate in relation to the bottom of the spring plate's housing.

I'll move to the other side and adjust the left spring plate to the same 
angle.

Does this sound like a good plan? One thing that confused me about the rear 
torsion proceedures in the library were the references to inner spline 
adjustments. Since it is a circle with equal splines around it wouldn't all 
the adjustments be made by the spring plate's position on the outer bar? In 
other words, aren't the inner splines adjusted exactly the same on both sides 
when the plates are removed from the equation?

Any advice from anyone who didn't sleep through physics class like I did 
would be appreciated!
