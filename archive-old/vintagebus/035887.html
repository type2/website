&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am hoping to build a garage this spring and I was getting 
quotes for
 concrete. they told me i should pour 3 inches and not 2 inches.  Also they
 talked about putting fiberglass in the concrete instead of using rebar. Any
 one have advise about pouring concrete garage floors?

I just finished my garage last spring. It is standard to place 4&quot; of concrete 
over about 4&quot; of  base material which is usually sand.  This is also standard 
for sidewalks, driveways, etc.  Sand is used becouse it is easy to handle and 
meets the compaction specs relatively easy.  Use the standard &quot;5-sack&quot; mix as 
the concrete suppliers typically call it.  This should develop 3500 psi at 
30-days.  This should be strong enough for most applications.  I did not even 
use welded wire mesh or rebar.  I have floor jacked many heavy vehicles, 
dropped heavy items like portable welders on it and no cracks whatsoever 
developed. Why go to the extra expense of fiberglass and rebar?  Make sure 
you put even expansion joints in the floor.  A nice broomed finish is nice to 
keep your butt off the floor.  Also, definately design in a 4&quot; or so stem 
wall to make washing your new garage out easier.  You do not want water, etc. 
on your framework and drywall (if you plan on finishing it out).  I also 
thought about adding a pit and flo
or lights but this turned out to be a hassle in the design area and in my 
urgency to get the thing built I passed on the ideas.  There was lots of talk 
in the group last year on these specialty items.
