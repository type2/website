Subject: Rear splash pans

I just received new splash pans for the rear bumpers on my '67 deluxe.
Looked in the archives, but didn't find much help on installing them.
Could someone help with this?  Also, what color are they painted on
white bumpers?
I'm also in need of (1) clamp for my roof rack..for some reason I'm
lacking just one.
Also, a working Sapphire radio with mounting frame for a 1967 (the
longer opening).  Complete, please.
An emergency flasher switch for 12v.
If any of you folks have these items for sale, please let me know.  Much
appreciated.
Susan
