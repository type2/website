Subject: '64 westy FS on the samba

On my way over to the samba to chk out the previously mentioned '54 FS in 
germany, there's also a pretty rusty subhatch '64 westy in Ohio for sale.  
There's a pretty good set of pix with it, this must be the &quot;transition&quot; 
interior that was used between the SO-34/5, and SO-42 era, no?  Is this an 
SO-33?  I've never seen an example of this type of interior, so I thought it 
was kinda cool.  it looks to me like this interior shared the icebox, cargo 
door &quot;bathroom&quot; cabinet, and right side side clothes cabinet with the 
flipseat westy, but everything else is pretty one of a kind.  The bed 
arrangement doesn't look like it would be that comfy either.

In case anybody needs interior parts for a camper like this, this might be a 
good contact.  Anybody have any idea of how many of those campers are 
around?  It seems to me that this era of westy's in between the flipseats 
and the SO-42's are kind of like &quot;bastard children.&quot;  Nobody seems to be 
looking for them.

Now that I've said that, in case someone does buy it for parts, I'd be 
interested in the bathroom cabinet ;-)
