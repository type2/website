Subject: '62 Single Cab FS

Hi all,
	As a favor to a friend of mine who does not have access to 
the web, I am posting this notice.

	1962 Single Cab For Sale - ALL restored, lightly driven the 
last 6 years, no rain, has bed slats,
	original canvas cover, hoops, no rust, Dove blue, 71 single 
port engine, 12 volt ( I think, not
	sure ). This is an awesome single cab. Even being in the 
northeast, it has not been winter
  	driven and is very well preserved. The seller needs to make 
some room, has enjoyed the truck
  	and now wants to move it.
	Contact Hugh Cyr at 781 - 631 - 1316. Tell him I send you 
about the truck. He is a great guy
	and not out to get a quick buck or two. I can answer general 
questions as I saw this truck
	before and after restoration, but any serious inquiries about 
purchase should be directed to
	him.
Mike
	67 Deluxe
