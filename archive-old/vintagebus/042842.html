Traveling Trampoliner's,

  The tranny is on the and drums are on.  I painted and was all set to put
the heater boxes and muffler on - but the new  &quot;german&quot; heater box's have
the controls on the outside instead of the inside and I don't know if they
come apart to reverse sides that easily.  Anyone done that?

  The emergency brake pawl does not fall down on the gear, so I guess
there is sand behind it from the sandblasting and it needs to be taken
apart and cleaned.

  The grey molding around the pop-top went in yesterday.  I suggest that
two people instal it, since that will make it easier.  Start by getting it
over the upper and lower lip and screw it in with wood screw in the center
of the strip.  Move 6&quot; down and do it again, all the way around.  It is
easier than the vent window rubber in comparison.

  I'd like to send a big thank you to Ronnie of Old Volks Home.  He knows
splitties.  I was dealing with someone else who advertises on this list
and he don't know much about parts for our splitties.  I caution all who
buy from the other Ron, I've had nothing but heartache when I find out
most of the pieces he sent were bogus loaf parts.  I'm still have many
&quot;suprises&quot; when I go to put on a part I ordered in July like the gas tank
cap (too big), tire rivets (too big), the above mentioned heater boxes and
numerous others ordering, packing, shipping, back-ordering and credit card
over-charging problems.

Best,
joe
