I have a  friend that 
did a water cooled GTI motor in a bay window. The only thing  that you see 
that  is different is the rear engine lid. He louvered  that. 
Good luck.

hey ronnie  Also tell him that he just blew his head  gasket recently :)   I 
suggest that chris put in a set of ear  plugs.   The subu 2.2 and 2.5 had 
their own set of problems also.  these motors are the reason for the subu head 
gasket in a bottle coming about.  It sounds like something is amiss as there 
isn't normally too much noise in  these splitties unless it is a empty panel bus. 
This coming from a guy who has 5  splitties on the road and has been driving 
tham since 1970. OK  I have  to ask,  Chris are you a girl or a guy, see the 
reason i ask is that girls  senses are a lot better than any guys , they hear 
and smell much better  than we do in more ways than one  :)   Without seeing or 
riding in the  bus I don't want to make too many suggestions other than stay 
away from  conversions.  later   Mark dearing
