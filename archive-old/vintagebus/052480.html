Subject: RE: [VB] Disassembling spindle assemblys

the upper king pins are a press fit into the lower kingpin. you really do
need a press and some kind of jig, or vw special tool 223a or 460. they are
really tight! i used the 223a and it took alot of force to get them apart.
puting the seals on is not really difficult, but to re-assemble you again
do need a press.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; How does one go about taking the spindle assemblys
&gt; apart on a 65 bus? The upper and lower link pin bearing
&gt; 'parts' don't seem to want to disassemble. Is there a 
&gt; trick or a special tool or just &quot;take it to someone who
&gt; knows how to do it&quot;.  The spindle assemblys are
&gt; tight but I am having to replace the rubber bands around
&gt; the joints. 
&gt; Thanks in advance!  ...and Happy New Year!
