Subject: when were truck bumpers used?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was noticing the different shape of the corners on the truck vs. the bus 
and , when were truck bumpers used does it have to be a spefic truck bumper ? 
or is it the same as a bus bumper I have a 1960 single cab as well as a 1965 
double cab 
what is supposed to be used on both of them ???

thanks    john clancy
