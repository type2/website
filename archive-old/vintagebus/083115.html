Subject: Re: Dizzy overhaul?

I apologize if I wasted this person's time and band-width not being clear.  I
don't want to bring bad Karma to others :(
I'm removing myself from this list after this post.  To all, please have a
happy and safe holiday, and thank-you for your great assistance.  I'm going to
go out and enjoy my bus!

Sincere regards,

Drew

I am not splitting hairs but I don't know why you said that. I tried to answer
your question with the info YOU
supplied. I said you had a 021N because you said: &quot;Would I set the 1700 dizzy
at the 1600DP 5 degrees
ATDC, or 10 degrees ATDC for the 1700?&quot;
Now you say &quot;should I set the timing to the 5 degrees ATDC of the 1700 type IV
from which it came&quot;.
This is a good example of not giving enough info and then you pick on the
people suppling an answer??  AND you
sent the frigging link of the dizzy you were referring to. It is still down
below from you post!!!

The 021N times at 10 after and the 021E times at 5 after WITH VACUUM RETARD
CONNECTED AND WORKING AT IDLE.

&gt; Another thought is that I should perhaps use the 71 bus dizzy which has a
significantly more conservative
timing and advance/retard curves (This engine is IRS while my bus still has
the RGB's).

GOOD luck finding one with a good vacuum unit.

&gt; If I keep the 74 Beetl;e dizzy, I'll need to source a replacement
vacuum/retard can for it...the dizzy holds
dwell perfectly but the can's
diaphragm blew :(

Wells makes a cheap replacement. Richard Atwell has posted the number a bunch
of times.

&gt; So many questions...thanks for the assistance and patience!
