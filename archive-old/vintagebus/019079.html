&gt; insulate your bus. makes a huge difference. takes

Thanks for the reply, but, my Bus is a 67 Camper with
full insulation and actually warms up real good with
just the regular heater. I drive it to work most days
and the temp at my house is typically about 10/20
degrees in the morning. What I don't want to do is
open a window to cut down on the wind whistle.
Ideas anyone, anyone.
