I'd have to agree with this one, personally.  My Kombi has the driver's side
glass as original, passenger's side glass is not.  I never noticed until
some vintage nazi pointed it out ;-)  &quot;Hey, where's yer logo?&quot;...if you've
ever seen my Kombi, you'd know the PO didn't necessarily have &quot;original and
correct&quot; in mind &lt;g&gt;  I'm still musing on reasons to have cut a large
&quot;access opening&quot; over the engine bay...

The '62 needs ALL of its glass except for the side popouts.  If I stumble
across originals, great.  But when it comes time to put this bus back
together, don't think that I'm going to b*tch and moan about not having the
bitty logo in the corners :-)  As long as it's quality glass, I'll be
satisfied.  Although I probably will swap the original out of the Kombi to
replace the cracked windshield on the Westy, just for the sake of matching.

Originality is important to me with many things, it just doesn't happen to
include lil logos on glass :-)

Not two cents...free!

&gt; hi all,
&gt;
&gt; a couple of years ago on the lists, everyone was recommending that if you
&gt; have a busted windshield on your split, just go get one cut to fit and
&gt; drive away....
