If it's brass, and on the lower left side looking at it from the back seat,
you've described the latch which further prevents the this seat from sliding
backwards. There should be a hole in the panel where the bolt slips into to
lock the seat in. This bolt also goes thru a side reinforcing body brace. It
is a tight fit and you may have to push this seat snugly against the back of
the drivers seat to slide the bolt in.

&gt; Got some excellent responses from my last one so let me try another...
&gt; OK, on my walk-thru SO-42 westy there is the seat / cabinet right behind
the
&gt; driver. On the bottom of the seat there is some kind of weird mount type
&gt; thingy. It's sort of  'L' shaped that's round on one end with notches in
it
&gt; and a shaft coming out of it. Does anyone know what this thing is for?
&gt; Just another one of those questions I've been asking myself.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jim
