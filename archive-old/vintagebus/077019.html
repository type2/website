Subject: Re: [VB] fixing up my 65

When I don't have power at the horn wire, I run a
jumper wire from the hot brake light switch wire.  Not
only does it power the horn, but you can then check to
see if there's power for the brake lights by honking
the horn.

&gt; no power at power wire to horn, which is that
&gt; yellow/black one from the right most fuse, and it
&gt; has power going into the wire.  Hopefully I'm 
&gt; crossing paths somewhere.   Horn used to work fine,
&gt; then stopped one day.
