3 of the bearings in your reduction boxes are the same as 68 and
older beetle rear wheel bearings... readily available and cheap.  You can
pull one from an old beetle swingaxle tranny if you have to.

Any VWflaps worth a s*&amp;t should have these in stock.  One of the upper
bearings is bus only, i am pretty sure its the inner one, but i could be
wrong as i've never had the redux box apart. These arent so cheap.

thats why many people like early redux boxes, they can be rebuilt super
cheaply and with little effort compared to the 64+ ones.

take care,

Steve
