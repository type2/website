Das Bulli Haus is the stereotypical &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; operation.  It's just Clay
and Mary, who both have full time jobs; Clay runs an automotive repair shop
and towing biz, and Mary works at the local college.  DBH has always been a
part time gig for them.

I talked to Mary about 3 weeks ago, and it seems they are having supply
problems.  The guy who makes the pieces (Allan Schofield) was having some
production problems in addition to some health problems.

I personally have a significant wish list with them, and have been waiting
for a while for it to be fulfilled, but since mine is a long term project,
I'm not in any significant hurry.  I've personally bought almost $2k worth
of stuff from them between the two buses, and it's only going to go up from
there.

Personally, I feel its worth the wait.  If you need something yesterday,
then you're probably stuck with the &quot;normal&quot; mail order houses.
