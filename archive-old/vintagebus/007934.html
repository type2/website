Thanks for validating my shifting speeds.  I always try to not treat the
engine like it's a sissy, but also to keep it happy.

&gt; sounds normal for max speeds when shifting.  some people like to cruise at
&gt; 4K, but I am not one of them.  I VW says top/ cruising speed is about
&gt; 3500-3700 rpms, but I believe the motor runs cooler/less stress at 3K for
&gt; cruising.  But I run the rpms up to about what you do for shifting too.
&gt; depends on whether I'm on the flat or not too.
&gt;


Yes, all four cylinders, with their wires pulled, sound the same...I got
some new wires just in case....yes, I have done my valves...last
Saturday...and I spent a great amount of time getting them &quot;perfect&quot;

&gt;
&gt; you are supposed the do a compression test with the engine warmed up.  Now
I
&gt; know why.    they are all close to each other- dont worry.
&gt;  However, all the plugs should be the same colour.   I would inspect the
plug
&gt; wires and cap.  is it running evenly on all 4 cyls?  do the pull one plug
&gt; wire off the dist at a time, then hold it close to the hole in the cap
(use
&gt; rag to not shock yourself) and listen to the diff sound as you let it run
on
&gt; 4 vs 3 cyls.  do this for all four.   the sound change SHOULD be the same
for
&gt; all 4.  if not, you probably have a spark distribution prob- examine the
wire
&gt; for the one that makes the least dif (which is probably the darkest plug)
&gt; and also a new cap can change this.   maybe you need new wires?
&gt; - - - - ------

I'll get some starter fluid or something to check for vacuum leaks, but
everything seems good torque-wise and visually.  If you use older pfennigs,
they have more pure copper...modern ones (and dimes) are mostly garbage
metal.

&gt; also, check for vacuum leaks.  are your carb bolts to manifold snug?   are
&gt; the DP boots between center and outer manifold good?  get a screwdriver
and
&gt; check that the hose clamps on them are snug.  are there leaks around the
plug
&gt; in the rear (faces you as you look at the motor) of the carb?  I have had
to
&gt; JB weld this back in, or if it is gone file a dime down slightly and use
that
&gt; instead.  Perhaps I should get some pfennigs to use to be cool?

My funny noises are a &quot;churning&quot; at about 3000rpm in third uphill, and also
upon startup, a &quot;heavy&quot; slightly &quot;lumpy&quot; almost knocking sound while the
engine is running rough because it's cold.  I hope I don't have any
nastiness going on....I'll videotape the engine in stereo sound before I
leave, and then again when I return from Shasta, and if there's any major
difference, there's something amiss.

&gt; what are your funny noises like?  you did adjust the valves, ya?   have
fun
&gt; on your trip, and keep a flashlight with good batteries behind the drivers
&gt; seat.
&gt;

Amen!  I've got three flashlights, tools, GL-4, Muir Tome, oil, spare stuff,
and much more!

Later!
