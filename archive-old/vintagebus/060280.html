Subject: RE: [VB] Highway Speeds

I have a 66 with a 67 trans, the trans was out of an early 67, and still
had a 4.37 r and p, which I had changed to 4.12 . I run 195/75/14s , and
hava 1600 sp. Most of my cruising is at 60-62, sometimes I hit 65 with
throttle left over, but I don't want to wind out more rpms.
I agree with the previous post, if the whoa power doesn't feel enough,
then don't use the go power, it isn't fun to stop quickly from a high
speed.
