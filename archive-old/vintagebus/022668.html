NOT TRUE!!  The difference is in the crankshaft diameter between a 40-horse
and a 1300/1500/1600.  The 40-horse has a larger diameter crankshaft than
the later engines.  Just b/c a flywheel is 6-volt, doesn't mean it's
necessarily off of a 40-horse.

&gt;&gt; Sure you can.  It's the other direction (12V flywheel, older tranny)
