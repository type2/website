I posted this a while ago but I'll post it again
cos i thought it was interesting.......

Volkswagen paint was originally produced by a german
paint company (strangely enough) called Glasso.

In 1987 Glasso was bought out by BASF and became Glasurit.

Glasurit apparently holds all the Glasso formulas from at least
55 and can supply a modern mix to match.  All you have to do
is supply them with the Volkswagen colour code (L whatever).

NOW note that I called a number of 'local' Glasurit resellers (auto paint
shops)
here in Australia all of whom said they couldn't match the Volkswagen code
and
also didn't know Glasso became Glasurit etc etc.

I ended up talking to a person in the BASF/Glasurit Head Office
in Australia who had ALL this information right there.  I spat an
L code and she had it!  She wouldn't give me the mixing formulas
but said if i went to a Glasurit reseller they could ring her (head office)
and she would give them the formula for any L code!  Voila!

So Glasurit has all this information.  You just have to find a source
with it (probably not your local Glasurit paint shop).
