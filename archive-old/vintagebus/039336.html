2600-2800 rpm isnt an option for me. with my small nut '66, 3000 rpm has me 
only going 40mph! when i get out after a long run on the highway at about 
55-60, she doesnt seem to be that hot. one time, while fueling up returning 
from the Detroit show, i checked the oil and the dip was pretty f-in hot 
though. i could just barely stand holding it. for a summer driver like me, 
maybe an external would be the ticket.
who knows,
