 I have read a couple of posts in the archives, an article in the type2
 library and a Hoover sermon that described the use of PU foam as an
 insulator in the cavities behind the interior panels in buses.
 
 Has anyone done this? If you have here are the inevitable questions:
 
 What can one apply to the body and the panels that will prevent the hardened
 foam from sticking? I want to do this so that I can pull the insulation from
 time to time to check for signs of corrosion. I thought of painting the
 metal and panels and then applying shrinkwrap to the surfaces, making a hole
 on either end of the panel and then mixing the foam in one of those small
  &gt;&gt;
I don't like sparyfoaming a bus as my experience is that water gets trapped 
between the metal and foam and corrosion is encouraged.   The making chunks 
and putting it in isn't as bad, but I used the silver bubble wrap stuff, 
insulates well, and does not trap moisture.
