Another long show day.

The westy didn't even place in the show!  I spent all day Saturday
polishing it, got it really sexy looking, but it just wasnt' enough.  One
thing that went against me is they made it so you couldn't vote in your own
class, so there's two votes it didn't get... :(

So, seeing how it was no longer a show winner, I had to off it.  A very
nice Japanese gentleman with a phat bankroll drove off into the sunset with
it this afternoon.  Who said the Japanese don't like early campers?  No, I
am not kidding.  I know I've railed about sending cars to Japan, but none
of the US people wanted to step up.  I wasted $50 putting the car on ebay
twice.

So, now I have no excuse for not concentrating on the '54.  Well, I don't
have the compressor wired up, no shop lighting yet, and...

I did pick up a set of repro doglegs for a nice price, and I'm going to try
and adapt them to the task.  Not much too much else in the swap.  The other
Big Buzz was the 23-window for $3k, which immediately went back on the
block for $5k.
