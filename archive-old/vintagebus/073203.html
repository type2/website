&gt; Chris,

&gt; Your suspicions are prolly correct - any strange dealings from people in
&gt; wierd places ARE strange. Do your deals locally with people you can call
&gt; and or visit. There have been scams where large money amounts are
&gt; transferred, then cancelled by the recipient, and the payer loses the
&gt; money, and the receiver can't be traced, nor can the 'paper trail'.

The &quot;send the balance&quot; scam is based upon people's faith in cashier's
checks.  They send you a fake cashier's check from a far-away foreign
bank.  You cash it and your bank puts the money in your account (provided
you are a good customer).  You give the crook somehing negotiable, like
cash.  It takes some time for the fake check to bounce, your bank takes
the money back out of your account, and you're left holding the bag.  the
crook doesn't want your merchandise, only the cash.

Cashier's checks are only good if you have immediate access to the
financial institution they are drawn upon.  Otherwise they are just as
rubbery as personal checks.
