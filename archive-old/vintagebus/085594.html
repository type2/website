Subject: Toe In

Hi,

I recently adjusted the toe in on my bus. What a difference. It now tracks 
nicely on the freeway. Previously is wandered all over the place.

I found an easy way to do this. While my bus was on the lift at the 
mechanics shop, I measured and adjusted the front end per Muir. This 
particular lift used the jack points so the suspension was hanging down. 
This gave me easy access to measure with a standard tape measure. I suppose 
you could lift your bus on a driveway or in your garage and do the same.

Good Bus'n.
Chris
