&gt;My questions are:
&gt;
&gt;1) Is there a trick or shut off valve to use so that gas doesn't go 
&gt;everywhere while replacing fuel lines?

Speed - work fast.  And don't use a drop light with an exposed 
bulb.  (Don't ask - just get the fire extinguisher)  Best method is to get 
two fuel line clamps (NOT Vice-Grips) and put one on the old hose, the 
other on the new hose.  Then you swap out the hoses, only having the tank 
flowing for a few seconds.  Then reconnect everything else at leisure...


&gt;2) what is the right best fuel line setup? Metal rubber or braided? I 
&gt;searced for post but haven' found out what is best.

Both - most busses had a braided line from the tank fitting to a metal pipe 
sticking through the front (FIF) tin.  The metal pipe went from the front 
tin to a point right near the fuel pump, where another braided hose 
connected the pipe to the pump.


&gt;3) Do I need to remove the engine to replace all the fuel lines?

Nope.


&gt;4) Last but not least, what is the most typical mechanism of engine fires. 
&gt;The gas starts leaking on to engine and ?? ( also electrical short ?? ) .

Lotsa sparks and stuff in there, especially with old plug wires.  Heat, too 
- that'll work for starting a fire.  And the hippie with the Sawzall...

&gt;  Does the gas ever start leaking and just douse the engine without 
&gt; starting a fire?

Oh yeah...I've been driving down the road when my bus started coughing and 
spitting...Jitterbugged down to where I could pull off, and open the engine 
room door to see what's up -- a fine fog of fuel everywhere from the 
fitting falling out of the carburetter...no fire, though, I must have been 
living right.


&gt;Thank you thank you thank you I really want to fix this right, 
&gt;fortuneately I did have a fire extinquisher on me but opening the engine 
&gt;hatch with a church key requires a certain finesse not normally associated 
&gt;with those in the presence of gasoline fires.

Blast it in through the vents.  and that yellow powder is corrosive - clean 
it up fast...

&gt;I am lucky very lucky but I don't want to rely on that for my next
&gt;spin in the inferno bucket.

Busses, like cats, have nine lives, but you never know how many have 
already been used up...
