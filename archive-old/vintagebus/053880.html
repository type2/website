&gt;Good point, I was thinking of auto repair accidents only, not all auto
&gt;accidents.

Depending on precisely what happened, I can see several categories under
&quot;Unintentional Injury&quot; for repair accidents... fire/burn, transport-other,
struck by/against, machinery, cut/pierce, overexertion...

&gt;If you resubmit your query to list the top 20, you'll see firearm murders
&gt;are 12,102 for 1998, which is more applicable to the quote you provided,
&gt;which indicated &quot;shot on purpose,&quot; not accidental deaths.

You're right.  That 866 number was for accidental firearm deaths.  So
for 1998 we have

Unintentional Injury - Motor Vehicle Traffic  42,191
Homicide - Firearm                            12,102

&gt;I wonder if that 12,102 includes the 50 kids I have &quot;unintentionally&quot;
&gt;killed for riding those motorized scooters...

Naah, that'd probably go under the 866 number, if you accidentally did
it with a gun.
