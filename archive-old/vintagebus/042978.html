Folks,

 I've been watching this thread for a while, and find it a bit disturbing.
I have had several pmail discussions with Bob over the last year and
a half, and he has been outgoingly helpful and respectful at all times. My
questions have all been topics that the list had not covered at the time,
or I simply couldn't find via the search engine. 

I am not a newbie, however, and as such, probably have not asked anything
that he might have found annoying, but maybe folks should search the
archives before asking him stuff. He mentioned to me at one point, about a
year ago, that he gets tons of mail, just because of the Sermons being
online, most of it really dumb and annoying (he gave me examples - they
were annoying). Imagine the mail you'd get if you had all those sermons
online. 

The times I asked him questions, I detailed all the facts and all actions
I had taken, plus all history pertaining to the situation. I received
detailed answers back and useful suggestions that worked. 

He's got his own life, and is at least as busy as I am, with many irons in
the fire. Maybe  folks should use the search engine to find answers to
problems, and then post to the list first, and not be so eager to load
down his email inbox.  I'm surprised that he still responds!
