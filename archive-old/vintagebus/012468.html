&gt; This would be okay but how about the auction ends at xx:xx:xx (am/pm) **OR**
&gt; 10 minutes after the last bid is recieved following xx:xx:xx.  That way there

&gt; clock giving others a chance to jump in.  No more last minute bids and makes
&gt; you bid the &quot;real&quot; amount the first time. 

While that is a good idea, it still has the fundamental flaw that you have
to sit around and watch the auction.  Perhaps a better solution for
resolving the tie would be that the earlier bid takes precedence.  That
would encourage people to bid high and early.

It can be quite disruptive to have to go watch the auction progress
at all hours of the day or night - like the set of euro headlights
that came up at 4:00am the other night.

I honestly have better things to do than babysit online auctions!

While you're all in a bidding mood - I have an early, cast-iron, 36hp
009 distributor up on ebay right now!  Has all new tune-up parts in it,
too!
