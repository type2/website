Thom,
Check out my companies web site at www.variflex_dot_com and look at our
quickshades. We have a 10 x 20 model that would suit your needs and
would be totally removable.  It's also collapsable so you don't have to
f**k around with poles.
I get zero commission so if you don't like them at all that's fine by
me.  If you do like them though I can probably get a discount...
Good luck!!
Jon
