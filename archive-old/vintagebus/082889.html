Greasy volks,

I didn't make it down to BBB this year, but my son and friends left
Provo Friday afternoon in My Sweet Bus.  They got to within a quarter
mile from the main Cedar City exit  on I-15 when they lost a cylinder. 
Fortunately I have a daughter living in Cedar while she attends SUU (Sue
U!)  So they limped over to her apt. and spent the night watching
movies.

Of course there is nothing in the way of parts or a shop for Dubs in
Cedar, but there is a guy twenty miles back up on I-15 in Parowan who
his a hobbyist.  Bryan cracked the head cover and quickly surmised el
problemo:  the push rods are cromoly and he adjusted them for no
expansion: .006.  Busted the tar out of the valve adjusting screws and
their heads.  The Hobbyist back in Parowan had some on hand so on
Saturday they went back up I-15 in Marnie Bee's L*x*s and picked a few
up off him and installed them.  Of course Bry readjusted the valves too!
 Rather than continue on, they just dinked around in Cedar City, went up
the canyon, over to Zion NP, etc. etc., and returned home on Mundy
nite.

MSB has busted down exactly twice since I've owned her, both times it
was Bry at the wheel.  They said even with the flow thru exhaust and big
muffler, no heater boxes, she was heating up over 325-350+   Wot in
heaven's name is happening?  She's an 1835, .044 heads, mild cam and a
progressive.

Cee ya next year.

PLV,

Curt
