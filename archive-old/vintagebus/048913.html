Wow!

I thought Shawn Zenor (SWUN God) stirred up a lot rucus with his statement about trip reports.

It's not like I was going to try and turn a 15 Window into a flatbed truck.  I was just thinking of adding 8 skylights to the roof.  Anyway, I appreciate everyone bringing me back down to earth.  Youz asks for opinions, youz gets opinions.

After spending 10 minutes in a guilt ridden state of mind, I quickly decided the thought of a conversion wasn't the greatest of ideas, and probably not too affordable either.  Afterall, a 1959 15 Window Deluxe is pretty cool in and of itself.  I'm content, I feel better.  My kids college fund stays intact.
