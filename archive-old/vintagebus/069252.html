Subject: Re: [VB] stud repair

The forward stud on the passenger side
serves the double purpose of mount
for the oil pick-up tube, and is locked
inside the case with a nut.
I've never had to repair that one from
outside, so check with E&amp;B !

&gt; So I was changing my oil and trying to fix a couple of bad studs when one
of
&gt; em stripped completely.  It is one of those 6 that hold on the little
plate
&gt; that I take off to change my oil
