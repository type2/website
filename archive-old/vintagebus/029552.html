Subject: VIN number question
References: &lt;80.1560aae.2716672d_at_aol_dot_com&gt; &lt;39E52970.24374EE9_at_magnet_dot_com&gt; &lt;005b01c033fa$dc4601f0$b73c0f18_at_cx1010260a&gt;

Another question about VIN numbers this time. What's the deal with the
body number on the passenger side bulkhead being different than the
chassis number stamped on the metal plate in the engine compartment. The
bus I'm referring to is my 56 panel. My 60 panel had all matching
numbers. The 56's title goes by the body number on the bulkhead so is
that correct for the VIN number. Would it be correct to dial the
bulkhead number into the vintagebus database or the metal plate engine
compartment number?

&gt; &gt; Could be but actually mine was built in Nov of 57 and to get on another
&gt; topic that I don't recall is... is my bus a 58 or 57 model year?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; According to my NEATO book, the 1958 model year started August 1, 1957.  You
&gt; are correct in that the model years do vary at times.  The &quot;standard&quot; August
&gt; model yearing schema began in August, 1955 with 1956 vehicles, thus many
&gt; people consider '55s more scarce due to the reduced model year (Jan-August).
