Ok. Right now I'm about to go check the generator, but just so this can be

answered and read later, I'll post it now, incase my generator tinkering is

for naught. Today, the bus wouldn't stay running once I let the clutch pedal

up after starting it. It has had the same gas in it since October, and there

is about a 1/4 tank left. I would like to get it out but siphoning does not

sound pleasant, so unless theres a better way I'm going to just burn it up

in the driveway. It doesn't seem to be getting gas or hitting on all four,

but I didn't have time to really mess around with it. It ran fine not too

long ago, as I started it once a week or so for a while, and I used it in

December to move. Now its backfiring, the red light is on, and its running

generally like crap. Any ideas? Thanks.

My 61 sits in the carport when it rains.    This means that it had the same
gas in it for a long time until a week or so ago.   Probably August.     I
counted to 12 while the starter went roud, it caught, and   Sounded a little
funky for the first minute, then sounded good.      I think at one point the
clutch actualy stuck .   I started it in reverse with my foot on the clutch ,
it jolted backwards, but then unstuck.     I think it sat there for 2  and a
half years until last summer.    Though  started it about every month anf let
it run for  for 1/2 hour.    If you start it- let it run enough to get the
water out of the exhaust else you accelerate the exhaust rusting away.
When I drove it out things were a little funky.    When I drove it for the
first time in 6 months a week or so ago the brakes were a little funky-
probably a bit of rust in the drums, but tht cleared itself up and then I
adjusted/flushed/bled the brakes.  and had to clean electric connections to
have working lights and bells.   But look elsewhere- oct ober gas wont do
that.   Do a tuneup.   Clean the carb maybe- gas leftovers can clog things.
Give it time.   Sit there with your foot on the clutch, brake off I hope , and
drive it rev it dont hit anything.
