A suggestion for all but the most extreme anal persons within our hobby. Use
lengths of appropriate gauge vacuum line slit lengthwise on one side only.
Slide along the edge where the origninals were intended. Install the splash
pans and forget about it. Cut the length so that one piece covers the entire
length of each splash pan on the edge closest to the bumper blade. No one in
thier right mind will check or give a **** if the rest of your bus is close
to Concours quality or a rat &quot;Rusty bus.&quot;
