&gt;&gt;A buddy of mine swears he has found an early LHD panel with a sliding door
&gt;on the drivers side. I'm no expert, but I've never heard of this combo. Can
&gt;you guys shed some light? Thanks!
&gt;


Yes! If he isnt full of hopes. There was an option for the sliding door on 
split window busses. Why anyone would want them is questionable, I like the 
fold out doors, but they were an option. Even rarer is the dual door 
sliders. Yes they were made, and very very rare. But if he found one nowdays 
this is extremely cool.

BTW hotmails new interface sucks. KISS Keep it simple stupid!
