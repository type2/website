Ahhhhh!  I knew I should have taken these 26 steps earlier!

Darn internet foiling me again.  It is amazing some of the information out
there that can tell you just about anything about your house history, car,
or personal life....  Kind of a little too &quot;1984&quot; for me :)

&gt; Now the really strange part is... How did he know where I live?  Kind
of creepy in another way, since I live deep in a neighborhood cul-de-sac
where no one would really know of.

Everett writ:
&gt;I don't know about that, Shadowlawn and Paper Mill are normal feeder
streets
and you're pretty close to them, anybody could just skip right over to your
house and help themselves, especially now that you are back at work and
it's empty...  Now you're freaked.  ;)

Or maybe it was the guy with the 1973 Orange Thing over on Fox Hills Dr.?

(And you thought the Star Wars system was scanning for missiles...)
