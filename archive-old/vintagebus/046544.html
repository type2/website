&lt;&lt; Coasting down the rod I hear a squeeky scrape scrape scrape sound. It gets 
 louder when I turn right and quieter when I turn left.
 
 I have already checked to make sure the drums are not rubbing on the backing 
 plates or shoes. I can't figure out if is coming from a reduction box or the 
 transaxle.

 Have you tried jacking up the rear end and spinning the tires?  Even start 
the motor and run it in first and take a listen.   you can grab one wheel and 
stop it so you can hear just the other one under power.  Are you sure it is 
from the rear?

I have heard thunky rumbles from bad RGBoxes.
