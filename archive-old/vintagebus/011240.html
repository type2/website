 If we are hunting for parts I could certainly use a rear seat bar for my 63 
 15-window ?  Or... does anyone have the specs w/ drawings for a bar ?  I am 
 not above trying to make, or hack as we say in the biz, my own since there 
 seems to be a real absence of these at the meets I have been to.

Someone does a good job of reproducing these.  I bought one from the 
Bug-O-Rama the summer before last.  Very nice, polished, and had the end 
caps.  Well it was before my kid used it for a bat.....  Forgot who sold it 
to me tho.  I was from the dealer area.  Anyone know?
