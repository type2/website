Subject: Re: [VB] 2-stage Two-tone?


I will be going Sata when I do my bus as well.  I did buy a different brand 
last time that worked okay but it did drive home the differences between 
them.  Sata is the standard from everything I found in my searchs and 
talking to people.

&gt;Steve, list
&gt;       Color uniformity is rarely a problem.  Although there are soo many
&gt;variables to that, more than just the guy who mixed the color too.  Sealer
&gt;color, gun setup, humidity, air pressure, painter, number of coats, etc etc
&gt;etc, you get the picture.  But, it is usually a VERY minor problem, and
&gt;something I will gamble on to insure a nicer overall paint job.  Most the
&gt;time, if you do see a color difference,  the color is soooooo close that 
&gt;only
&gt;the painter can see it, and he or she is second guessing him or herself, 
&gt;and
&gt;usually only under flourescent lights.  (they show all)  Metallics tend to 
&gt;be
&gt;more of a problem with uniformity, but it is usually with the way the 
&gt;metalic
&gt;&quot;lays&quot; than the color itself.
&gt;        As far as guns go, I only use Sata Jets.  They are the best, in my
&gt;opinion, and spray sooo nice.  Most paint suppliers will let you rent one, 
&gt;or
&gt;use one if you buy enough stuff.  Don't be afraid to ask..  I use the 
&gt;NR2000.
&gt;  It would be worth the money if you had to pay to rent it, but get them to
&gt;help you set it up..  Experience is needed here...  Most gravity feed guns
&gt;spray well, but they do all spray a little different.  I just like the sata
&gt;overall.
&gt;Good luck...
&gt;John
