&gt;We use a single edge razor blade to cut off the crud after washing once to
get off the loose stuff. Eric&amp;Barb &lt;

I agree with the razor blade technique.  Then follow up with a old school
mixture of 50% water and 50% white (clear) vinegar and B&amp;W newspaper as the
wiper...  Very old school trick but it works great with zero residue.

Also you can use a very fine steel wool to get out stubborn crusties as
well.

Scuzzy windows are a drag!


Good Luck,
