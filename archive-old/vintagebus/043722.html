&gt;Does anyone out there have or know the exact wiring details (mine is a mess) 
&gt;between the fans and the switch(6screw terminals)???

Bentley shows an overview but does not identify the individual terminals.
See Thom's scans of the original color wiring diagrams, such as
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-62.jpg .

Thom also has a scan of some German ambulance fan installation instructions
that have another wiring diagram and a good picture:

&gt;Also exact wiring of the fans to the vehicle in user friendly terms:)...

Note from Thom's scans that there is a wire from the switch to the
mounting bracket; this is a ground wire.  The screws that hold the
plate to the air duct complete the ground circuit.  You will have one
more wire from the switch to the far right fuse in the fuse box - it
should also have an inline fuse holder with an 8 amp fuse.

&gt;Is there any way I can make sure they work before wiring them completely to 
&gt;the bus?

You can test each individual motor by touching its leads to the battery.
Once you have both motors wired to the switch, you can test the whole
assembly the same way.  Clip-leads are probably easiest. Run one
clip-lead from the plate to the body.  Clip one end of the second
clip-lead onto the &quot;feed&quot; terminal on the switch, and clip the other
end onto one end of an 8-amp fuse.  Touch the other end of the 8-amp
fuse to the battery positive post, and operate the fan switch.  0 is
off, I is full speed/bright light, and II is half speed/dim light.  If
you did anything silly, the 8-amp fuse will blow.  If all is well,
remove the clip-leads and hook them up!
