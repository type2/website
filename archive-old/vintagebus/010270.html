i have a pair of chrome window rain guards from a beetle on mine and they
look really cool, it was a previous owner addition i think, or is it
possible that they are an accesory air scoop? i would think that they are
worth adding if you have them, jb

&gt; Does anybody on the list use the fiberglass air scoops that mount over the
&gt; vents for the engine?  Are these worth hooking on the body?  I have a pair
&gt; that came with my 66 westy, not sure if I should mess with them or not.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Steve
