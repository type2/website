Volks-

Ok, I'm guilty.

About a dozen of you (so far) have sent replies (mostly polite) to my
Internet long distance phone charge message sent yesterday.  Obviously, the
content was inadequately researched on my part, and as I send this, I am
quivering with embarrassment!  (If only I had sent it today, I could have
claimed it was an April Fools joke!)

Thom's advice was correct:  If a message urges you to forward it, it is
probably a hoax.

I'll stick to ignorant VW questions from now on.

Dave
