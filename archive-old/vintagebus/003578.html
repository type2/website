Thom
Thanks for the reminder.
I just signed up. I meant to
sign the petition when you first
mentioned it, but I forgot.

&gt;
&gt; I come to you with my hat in my hand...
&gt;
&gt; I screwed something up in the first version of the
&gt; bentley campaign script.  The first few people signed
&gt; up fine, then I broke something, and nobody else was
&gt; able to sign up.  I was looking yesterday to see how
&gt; many people had weighed in an thought &quot;That's strange -
&gt; only 4 people?&quot;  So I did a quick test, and of
&gt; course, it didn't work.  It was a quick fix, but anyone
&gt; who tried to sign on from January 27th to February 4th
&gt; didn't get saved.  That's what I get for trying to work
&gt; on the bus and on the web at the exact same time; I'd
&gt; lay down some weld, and while it cooled, I'd slam out code.
&gt;
&gt; So, if you'd signed the petition between 1/27 and 2/4,
&gt; could you please re-visit the page and sign on again?
&gt; If you haven't yet, this is the perfect opportunity to
&gt; do so.  The whole of the bus community will benefit!
