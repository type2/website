&gt; I thought John Denver died in an aircraft
&gt; accident cos the experimental he was flying 
&gt; went with the 70 single relief fitted with incorrect
&gt; oil cooler grommets??
&gt; 
&gt; And he's been a bit cheesed off about it ever since?

exactly, damned to hell by the vw gods for his transgression, he returned to earth as devil span evidenced by the 666.  &lt;cali chick voice&gt; dude, that's some heavy karma, man.  bummer.  &lt;/cali chick voice&gt;  hey, it feels like friday!
