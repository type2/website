Subject: RE: [VB] 72 Westy stuff into a 66 ?? 

Well I am sure it is possible, you will prolly need a
saw of some sort and maybe a few tools. I would first
start by removing the middle seat of the 66 and
setting it aside (don't forget to put it back in!).
Then take that late model interior and saw it into
small easliy handled pieces, and stack neatly inside
the 66. If you run out of room, put some of the
bulkier stuff up top on the rack, don't worry about
the weight, old buses were built for this sort of
thing. The ideal thing would to be to wait for a VW
campout and bring it there and burn it instead of
those engine cases that everyone thinks is novel.

&quot;Is it possible or what is needed to put the interior
of a 72 Westy into a 66 
bus?&quot;
