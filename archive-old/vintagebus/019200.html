&gt; Chuck,
&gt; I remember seeing the show but I don't remember what
&gt; happened.
&gt; Did they get the plane out?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;My bus is still iced in, I plan on getting  out
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; oxy-acetylene
&gt; &gt; setup this morning to thaw her out. It's kind of
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; that crew
&gt; &gt; on the Discovery Channel who found that WW II
&gt; bomber
&gt; &gt; under
&gt; &gt; the ice and brought her back to the surface.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; John
&gt; &gt; Careful with that torch, remember what happened to
&gt; &gt; that WWII Bomber that was dug out of the ice?
&gt; &gt; 

John,
And now the rest of the story, With a years effort in
the cold and snow, a team dug out of about fifty feet
of ice a perfectly preserved WWII Bomber (like finding
a perfect Barndoor Bus in an old shed) that made an
emergency landing with engine troubles and abandoned
for fifty years to be covered with snow and ice.
Millions of dollars were spent over the course of
about a year in the most miserable conditions to dig
out the bomber with the idea to repair the plane and
FLY it out! They did get it to the surface and found
it to be in remarkable condition needing new fuel and
batteries and it fired right up!!! After a few days of
maintence the team with incredable optimision decided
to clear a runway and take off. Since this was
financed as a documentry, everything was filmed...They
started it up to fly it home and as they were getting
ready to start taxing down the runway, it seems that
someone 'forgot' to tighten a fuel line and the
leaking fuel cought fire and quickly spread to engulf
the entire plane, and the crew could only stand by in
horror and watch it burn to the ground(snow)... 
So with the history of bus fires, it's funny you
should compare it to the famous 'found' WWII Bomber.
Be careful with the torch.
