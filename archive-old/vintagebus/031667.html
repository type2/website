  Just got a new shippment of the round replacement mirrors in, all I can
say is wow. The new version has done away with the sharp edge around the
glass and now has a rolled edge with a small rubber seal holding the mirror
in. Also they are now POLISHED for that beautiful look. I hope the stems on
these hold up better then the first generation batch. Haven't had problems
with the second generation though and now we have the 3rd generation and
they are nice, still have the VW part number on the little ring. P-mail for
price.
