I'm looking at upgrading my (PC) computer so I can do things a little faster 
on the Internet - Mostly VW related stuff.  Would like to start a Binz 
webpage and similar stuff.  My current system works but is a bit slugish 
compared to my work computer.

The wife can get a $2000 interest free loan from work for anything computer 
related.  Nice perk eh?  Right now I have a 100mhz pentium with 32meg of ram.
My question is: Is it worth the money to drop $2000 on a Pentium 3 system or 
do I just upgrade what I have with more memory and a faster modem...or 
something in between?  All opinions appreciated.

Thanks,
Dan
