A couple of weeks ago I posted about a '65 Kombi I picked up. I got a few
replies, thanks! now here is the situation: I thought I was getting the bus
for a friend but then he backed out of the deal  and so I ended up with it.
It seems too good to part out but right now I have too many &quot;irons in the
fire&quot; and would be willing to let it go to someone interested in getting it
back on the road. Here is the low down:

1) good body with decent econo paint (except as I previously forgot to
mention, the rear wheel wells have been cut round!), very little rust,
solid floor, walk thru, white and dark green, good steering wheel;
2) good engine 1500 s.p.;
3) a lot of new rubber, floor mats a little rough but intact;
4) All electrical works, no radio good lights/lens all around;
5) receipts for a complete brake job in '97, lots of other receipts;
6) 3 &quot;new&quot; tires, one ruined from sitting flat;
7) no bumpers;
8) needs a new tranny; 

I have pictures.   

 CHEAP!
 
anyone interested e-mail me off the list.
