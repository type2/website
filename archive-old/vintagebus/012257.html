You need a hump and a hole

&gt; I'm still looking for an engine lid for my 59 bus. But which lid is the
&gt; right one? The one that is straight all the way down? Or the one with the
&gt; hump at the top for the license plate light? My bus rolled out of the
&gt; factory in March of 59. So which one is the one? And does anyone have
&gt; one???? Also which apron is the right one? The one with the hole or no hole?
&gt; I'm still looking for both.
