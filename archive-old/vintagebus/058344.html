Subject: RE: [VB] Carbs again....

Vacume leak. Also the duration on your cam is such that the fuel won't stay
vaporized as long as it would with a stock cam with such a small carb.
Sounds like the aluminum carb is expanding in the heat and opening up
causing a vacume leak. Could also be the throttle plate shaft bushings
expanding in the heat.

1600 SP CW crank Engle 100, stock air cleaner...New/rebuilt/old
PICT30-3, with the elec aux jet.
112.5 main 60 pilot, also with 65 pilot.
Symptom.
	Engine cranks and cranks when warm. Timing static on the 009
around 11.5, dynamically timed to 32.
	Engine finally gets going (with gas pedal help usually) runs
rich stumbling angrily for a bit, then idle returns to fine.
	If cold, good, if sits for a while to cool, then good, 10-25
minutes after run, bad.
Since mixture seems good, and runs nicely, where the heck do I look for
this problem? I thought a dirty pilot, but not that. Then I figured fuel
pressure problem, but wouldn't it run badly all the time?
If the float was stuck and not kicking the fuel shut off, wouldn't I
have a mess?

Al, still wondering about solexes...
