Subject: RE: [VB] Warming up a cold engine....

Gene always told us, like warming a race car, to rev it up at odd RPM's for a
minute or two and you won't risk scouring dry cylinder walls and the heat will
build up quicker. The only problem is....
Nobody likes to hear their neighbor reving up his engine for what seems like
an eternity!

The electric choke on my center mount carb is fine for what it does by setting
the RPM up a little while the temp rises, but after the temp is up on the
choke and the idle drops down, the engine isn't really up to temp yet, not
until I'm a mile down the road. Also, at night I have a higher current draw
and the generator isn't charging at idle.

So..... I just fire it up and take off. So much for planning!

Ok, I've heard several arguments over how to properly warm up your bus when
starting it cold....  So what is the correct way?  I would assume if I had a
stock setup with heat risers it would be different or faster than my current
setup with a bugpack header and dual carbs.  I park on a hill when not in
hte garage and currently use the start the engine with a few pumps of gas
and continue out of the driveway.  Others recommend warming the engine prior
to driving away.  I recently read in the Muir book to not warm it in the
driveway....
