&gt; Micheal,List,
&gt;        I have put on rockers from RMM before, and agree, they aren't very
&gt; good, and look to be &quot;seconds&quot; in my opinion.  (ie: the cargo door rocker
&gt; didn't have the intermediate rocker attached like factory, and the piece
&gt; behind it, to the fender well, actually was a bay window part, not
spittie,
&gt; wrong lip at the end)  I have put on &quot;many&quot; rockers that came from BFY
&gt; though, both sides, and they are cheap, and fit rather nice for the price.
&gt; Seems to me that it all has to do with the manufacturer that the parts
house
&gt; gets them from.  My favorite rust repair panels, for the price mind you,
are
&gt; the Orange panels, not sure where those come from, and thats the kind BFY
&gt; sells.  My experience, take it for what it is, is that &quot;NO&quot; rust repair
&gt; panels fit perfectly...  You gotta &quot;massage&quot; them into place.
&gt;
&gt;        Be sure to use a MIG welder and don't warp your bus, especially the
&gt; drivers side when you put it on, or your body man will hate you!  Spot
weld
&gt; it, no solid welds there!  Wait along time in-between welds, use an air
gun
&gt; to help cool the metal after you weld it, and do it over an entire
&gt; afternoon...
