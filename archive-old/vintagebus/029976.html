&gt;     my question for everyone is this.  After reading the ad  would you
&gt; assume that the bus is running?

1600 DP motor complete not installed
condition unknown

This line right here would tell me that the Bus comes with an engine NOT
installed, but some people would perceive that as an extra engine.
For me personally, the lack of a tail pipe along with that line would mean the
Bus is NOT running.
