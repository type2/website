Heck, there's not one but *two* double-door standards in my gallery, *both*
of which have the correct seats.

How about a 6-leg RHD middle seat?  I got one from a fellow listee, and
didn't have to pay a speculative price.

There's been a DD middle seat for sale for a few years now in SoCal -
$1000, no takers.  So why is $1500 suddenly too cheep?  Or why is the going
rate suddenly $3000?  

I'm stumped.

Why kind of super-duper, vintage-nazi-offensive beast can be worth a 3000
seat?  Perhaps the '58 DD panel with the walk-thru barndoor front roof,
sunroof, and skylight windows that's somewhere on my page?

&gt;I got a piece of lit. with a barndoor double door seat......beat that! ;-)
&gt;Not to mention the 2/3 short seat with green upholstry......I think that 
&gt;beats a DD carmel........or that seat in ujj's 51....top that!
