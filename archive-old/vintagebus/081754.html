Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Lever Thingy Needed

Hello Gene  I have welded these up and grouned them to fit before  which 
worked very well. The bolt and nut replacement for the cleft pin works but you 
need a bolt that isnt threaded all the way and use two nuts to lock them together 
also do not over tighten there needs to be room to pivot , grease works well 
there .  Real question is what did you do to get rid of the hippies  LOL    
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing    ps I might have some of these levers but I 
dont think I could get it to you in that short amount of time
