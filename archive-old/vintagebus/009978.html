Subject: [VB] web master and grease cap needed

I cant seem to locate a passenger side grease cap for my 66 bus, i have been
looking for several months, does someone have one available or know where i
can order?

Are there any freelance perl/cgi/java/etc experts out there amongst you bus
people that can customize a website for me? It would be cool if the money im
about to spend went to a bus fanatic, pmail me please.
