Subject: Re: [bus-life] Different Camper

&gt; Has anyone on the list ever heard of a Camper
&gt; company call Travel
&gt; Equipment Corp. out of Elk Hart Indiana?

i thought there was a 'sportsmobile' or sportwagen
conversion done out of elkhart.  maybe their official
name  is Travel Equipment corp.  kind of like ASI and
Riviera are the same out of vancuver washington one it
the company and one is the model.
i have only ever seen bubble window sportsmobiles but
then i haven't seen too many old splitties from east
of the rockies. so i am not too qualified to make a
blanket statement.
