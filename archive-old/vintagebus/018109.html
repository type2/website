Who said anything about being &quot;intelligence&quot; and
&quot;hate&quot;?  Why must people automatically throw words
like that into a discussion that they don't agree
with?&gt;&gt;

I wouldn't say that those words were automatically
thrown in... I'm sick of (unintelligent) comments like
those of Mike's (especially those in p-mails), bashing
hippies, rock stars, whomever. (hate) Just because
Eddie wants another VW, doesn't mean the hobby is
coming to an end.  I hear what you all are saying
about crazy prices and all, but I think it's a little
late for that... I found my deluxe for $800 and have
been offered 17k since i've fixed it up.  So what. 
Lets just enjoy our cars and keep having fun with
them!

I think Andrew said it nicely: 
&quot;But if your going to bash a guy like Eddie for
wanting to buy a bus then you
might as well bash everyone else who has the money to
buy vintage buses too.&quot;
