Thanks to everyone for the words of advice and technique in my shorty bus
dilemma.
I finally acted on the tip of one list member and called Arnold back to
offer him $5.00 for the bus.
I said, &quot;we never did figure out what 3 meant, and if you mean $3.00, why
since it's Christmas time I'l go ahead and give you five bucks for the bus.&quot;
Arnold laughed and said, no I want $300.00 for it.&quot;
&quot;Well that's a relief&quot; I said, &quot;because my wife was convinced you wanted
$3,000.00.&quot;
Arnold laughed and thought that was pretty funny. I told him I would call
him back after I talked to
my wife, and I think  that for $300.00 or thereabouts, I'll drag it home.
It's got plenty of parts I need for my '56 and the rest of it I'm sure I can
find a use for, perhaps an addition to the &quot;performance art&quot; project already
in progress in my driveway.
Stay tuned for &quot;Shorty Bus - The Final Chapter&quot; coming soon.
