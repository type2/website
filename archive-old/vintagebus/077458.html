Subject: RE: [VB] re:roof rack damage

Actually I can't quite get a sheet of plywood in there, that would be really
nice. I had actually built some wood slats, very nice out of this really
hard antique pine salvaged from a house renovation. Unfortunately I didn't
finish it, left out to weather it didn't fare too well.
