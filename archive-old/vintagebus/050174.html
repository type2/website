Subject: Vent Wing Rivets [Was: Re: still chasing flickers]


&gt;p.s. I never saw the results about the thread concerning a place to
&gt;purchase a tool that will repair the rivets in the vent windows.

Joe says that type of rivet is called a &quot;brad rivet&quot; as opposed to a pop
rivet. He gave me a handful of assorted sizes left over from when he worked
sheet metal. In essence these things are the same as the rivets for holding
the hubcap clips on the wide five wheels although I don't know if they are
the right size.

I got my wife to help, used a chunk of cold roll for an anvil, and
carefully peened the appropriately sized brad rivets into Pandora's new cab
windows; worked great. Try your local hardware emporium (not Home Depot or
its ilk, the hardware store that's been there for 50 years) or as a last
resort send me pmail and I'll ship you some rivets.
