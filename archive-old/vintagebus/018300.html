No; my figure was based on the fact that I had it UPS delivered, so after
delivery, tax, etc it was just a little over $200.  Mine had the back and
sides, but no front.  I still have the instructions that came with mine; I've
always meant to contact them and see if they make a front panel/door, which I'll bet 
they do.

&gt; Costco's they are 149.95 and Big K-Mart also has the same covers for 175.00
&gt; sans back and sides.
