Subject: My OCTO/Classic too....LONG!

After many a long night thrashing (read panicking) on the double cab
till 2 am for a week straight, I succeeded in getting it in presentable
shape for OCTO.

A top end rebuild, new brake system and bearings, tranny/box drain
refill, motor brake-in and install, blasting of tin, wheels and bumpers
and then painting , buying new tires and installing them, installing new
front rubber (and destroying it by not lubing it enough...it held for
the OCTO show) and test driving it, it was finished about 1 am Sat.
morning.  Shifter was and still is funky....have to post my question
later.  Whew!  I will never procrastinate like that again.....yeah
right!

Matt and Katie wanted to drive a splitty, so I offered the ugly but
drivable 67 Westy.  They met at my house Sat. and my neighbor and I
jumped in the DC and off we went.  This was great.  I've been going to
VW shows for about 10 years, and this was the first time I'd ever taken
a bus...this time both of mine were running at the same time!  I had
loaded up the back of the DC with extra junk I had since the price was
the same to swap as long as you took a splitty.  They directed me to the
swap spot and spotted Robert Davis right off.  I honked, but he looked
puzzled.  Guess he didn't recognize the 15&quot; rims he sold me (the week
before) since I'd blasted them and painted them :-)  I unloaded
everything, and then realized with all my stuff out I couldn't look at
everyone else's :-(   Oh well, kept me from spending any money.  I made
enough to cover the cost of the new tires and the rest of the
weekend...and I cleared out some space in the back yard!

The show?  Twice the size as last year and great as usual!!  Nothing
else to say except that the SOTO booth was right next to me and was
soooooo quiet you could have heard a pin drop!  Did get a flyer that
said their show would be some time at the end of July.  Thanks again to
Harry for the brew too.  Oh yeah, thanks to Matt Henricks for scoring me
two original safari dash tabs.  I now only need 6 more to complete my
two sets of windows...any one have any tabs or wing bolts ???

I went home and ran out and bought two new seals to replace the NOS ones
I trashed.  What a dumb a$$ I was.  Don't try and do things when you are
exhausted, you'll F'um up.  This time I used Vaseline on the seals and
it worked great.

Sunday was the same and we carabused down from Fullerton to the
Classic.  The line was backed up to the off ramp and stopped.  I shut
off the DC and smelled HOT went back and did the stick test and it was
warm, but I could still hold it.  Tried to start it and it barely
started.  I never shut it off till we got in....which took about 45 min
of idling and inching along.  Ironically the hoopty 67 ran like a champ
and didn't miss a beat. Hot tip is to come late and cruse in with no
line.

The classic was nice, but as others have said not the same vibe.  I did
find a few dollar items but my big purchase of the weekend was a 55-67
NOS steering column lock with the plastic cover for about $50 less than
that cool  one strap air cleaner Thom found for his '54.

Heading back, I had forgotten all about the overheating until,
ironically about the exit for the Pond.  I started smelling hot again
and noticed my brakes had no free play.   I stopped and felt the
wheels....way too hot.  Motor too.  I'd been draging the brakes for
miles...crap.   I pulled the MC loose and realized in my haste to finish
the truck I'd not backed off the push rod :-(   How ironic to be laying
under a bus wrenching on it in the exact spot that 24 hrs earlier was
flooded with busses.  Not sure if this was the cause for the motor
getting too hot though.  Let it sit for a spell and then continued on.
Got home OK, but still too warm.  I'll post my question later.

Lastly just wanted to say it was great to really spend some time with
some of the list.  Wish I could have met more.  I'm planning on going to
Solvange(sp?) in Oct. anyone else???

Thanks for reading.

Steve
