Subject: Re: [VB] Boycott Exxon

Due to their oil spill in Alaska, I already refuse to buy gas from Exxon or
Mobil.

&gt; Someone brought this up before, thought it was a good idea.  To get the
&gt; price of gas down, don't buy gas from Exxon or Mobil (same company).  If
&gt; enough people avoid this company, prices will have to go down.  Besides,
&gt; look what they did in Alaska (What oil spill, looks fine to me!).
