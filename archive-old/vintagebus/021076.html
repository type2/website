Subject: RE: [VB] 019 distributor

019's, though stock for the Porsche 356 (a companion, predecessor or 
replacement for the 0231 129 022 and the 912's 0231 129 031) were marketed in 
the 70s by Bosch as the &quot;Screamer Kit&quot; for VWs (the latest published blurb was 
in my 1976 Bosch Ignition Parts Book), which was subsequently replaced by the 
009.  Problem with 019s, 022s and 031s are they are for high revving motors 
like Ronnie's &quot;screemer rpm&quot; engines and typical Porsche 1600 series, the 
advance comes on too quick in the powerband and generally too high for the 
stock VW engine (do I hear pinging?).  These are practically a different animal 
compared to the VW daily driver engine.  Great for the dragstrip, but not 
really that great for daily driving.  Stick with the stock vacuum dizzy.  009s 
are OK in a pinch to get ya home.

&gt;   The 019 are what came stock in 356 Porsche, I do not have the year break
&gt; down for them (in Porsche) but the advance curve is set up in them for
&gt; higher rpm's. I have found them to work good in an air cooled VW but the
&gt; total advance seems to be more around 3500-4000 RPM. They work excellent in
&gt; my screemer rpm engines

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; i just put a 019 centrifugal distributor in my bus and i have a question
&gt; about timing it.  in order for me to get it to advance to 30, it has to be
&gt; set at 15 btdc at idle.  can this be right, or is something wrong?  thanks!
