Subject: Re: [VB] AN INTERACTIVE VINTAGE BUS EMAIL!


 1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac?
 
I always wanted a bug when I was a little kid.  I think it was after I first 
rode in this bug on the way to the beach- me and my brother and this kid Clay 
were in the back of Clay's folks bug (light green?) and someone shook up a 
pop can and opened it in there.  pop sprayed everywhere.   It was cool.  I 
lived in LA and in the 5 mi ride to the beach I could count 100 bugs.
 
 2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if there 
 not all the same)
1st car was a 73 pop top westy.  when the motor wore out I got a 59 bus that 
cost less that the pancake rebuild.
 
 3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this 
email 
 wiill be HUGE!)

61 15 window
53 standard
67 riviera 

 4. do you have a favorite? wich one?

they are all special and nifty keen.  I love the dash and corner windows of 
the 61.  The 53 smells like old horsehair and cloth headliner- classic VW.
 
 5. stock or custom?
what is useful.  stock height , updating to a 1600 .  gotta have a hat.   not 
much into the hot rod stuff.    I like finding all the stock/year correct 
trinkets for the bus, but a 9 seater doesn't work for me as a daily driver so 
the 61 has some westy stuff in it.  The 53 I want as stock OG vintage pervert 
as possible. 

 6.would you punch an alien?
I don't tend to punch anyone.
