185R14 or  185/80R14 are closest to stock size, but the 205/70 is also popular.

&gt; Howdy all!
&gt; I need to get new tires for the '66 bus which I just bought.  Right now, there is a different size tire on every wheel!  I swear, 4 wheels, 4 different sizes.  So, What is the correct tire size for a '66 camper??  14 inch obviously, but 195x75, 185x75, 175x75?????  P.S.  I just listed by 75 Riviera on the classifieds page to make room for the '66, if you're in the market, it's a good one!
