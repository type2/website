Subject: 4th of July -BANG! Fried Motor Blues
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well I hated hearing it but as I cruised up a steep hill shifting to 3rd gear 
I heard a Bang! followed by a rumble, rumble sound then nothing but silence. 
Yikes! I ve blown something in there (1600DP) . Full of oil but smells burnt. 
Large nut does not turn. Its frozen. Need ideas as to what da heck happened.
