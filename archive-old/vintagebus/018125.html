Subject: C clamps for 65-67 Big Top Tent
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey gang I bit the bullet and bought a 65-67 Big Top
Westfalia tent for my 67 that is in the restoration
process.  I have yet to recieve it but research
reveals that I will need some sort of attachments for
the tent.  Would these be w/the tentpoles or should my
bus have these.  Can I fashion my own?  I am getting
close to having all the original stuff, then I will
save up for a visit to the metal wiz.  

Take Care,

Patrick Flynn
67 Westfalia SO42 Benchseat
