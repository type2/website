Hey Mike,
    There will be about 10 buses from the DBG going to VwoA. We will arrive
Friday evening
and will be camping at the Pontiac Lakes campground.Please feel free to join
us!
    This years show's theme is &quot;50 Years of The Transporter&quot;,so for us bus
nuts I feel it's a must see .
The swap meet in the past has been quit nice,Todd S. should be there selling
cool stuff as always !
The VwoA Museum will be open for all to see ! A nice barndoor and a 61 So23
are there.There is a banquet dinner Sat. night which entails
a slide show on new Vws and some cool old videos.On Sunday, during the show
,Vw. lets anyone who wants
drive one of there new techno trash cars around.I beat a NB last year.
    My fellow DBGer and buddy Brian Holcomb will be debuting his freshly
restored 62 Westfalia SO33
at this show.Any Vw., this family of Vw. mechanics, touches turns to gold
and this one is no exception.
He started this restoration in January of 2000 and had her on the road
Monday ! Thats equals the god-like speed of Mr. Fitzpatrick !!
How do you guys do it ? There is also a nice guy from Canada who brings his
incredible So34 down, this is worth the trip alone !
        Hope to see some listees there ! I'll be driving my '64 turquoise
kombi/westy, stop by and say Hi !!!

                 woody
         &quot;keep on pushin&quot;
