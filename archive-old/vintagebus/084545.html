Well, its been a year since I took my 1967 Westfalia apart to replace the floor 
and i'm finally putting things back together. I can't figure out what pieces I 
may have removed between the rod that drops down from the accellerator pedal and 
the loop on the front end of the accellerator cable.  I don't have a Bently 
manual or equivilent, so i sure would like a description or direction to some 
web archive someplace so I can have a look.  I assume its a simple pivot of some 
kind.
