Actually, we're almost there; 25hp P/C's will run you a cool $600,
and I've seen 36hp P/C's  in the $400+ range.  An NOS 25hp &quot;big hole&quot; fuel
pump would probably run you well over $100

&gt; This, for me, is the nub of all these 40k buses... soon, if you CAN'T
&gt; afford to run in those circles, your bus WILL NOT be of use to you.
&gt; Sadly, I will NOT be able to run mine whan a fuel pump is $100 when
&gt; available, or P&amp;Cs of any quality are $500.
