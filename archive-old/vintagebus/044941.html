Subject: Barrett Enterprises Closed?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there--
I just read a post in the Ramva newsgroup. It said that Barrett recently 
closed? It also said that the employees reported for work and came to an 
empty shop recently. Interesting? What are we gonna do without the orange 
pages in the VW rags? NQ, didn't you have some troubles with them?
--I'm not sure of how accurate this info is, so don't hold take it too hard. 
Just relaying a message.

If anyone knows any more info, please clarify my post.
