Hi, I have searched the archives to see if I could find the answer to my 
question. But, no answer.  Here goes.  I am having trouble splitting the 
reduction boxes on my 60 Panel. I don't want to have to pound these guys into 
submission for fear of doing something I might not be able to fix. Oh yeah, I 
haven't fully removed them off the Arms yet.  Any suggestion? -thanks.

I am assuming the transaxle is on the floor, not in the bus, and you have 
already drained the oil  (if the oil is still in, drain it or you will have a 
big mess)
you have the brakes off, backing plate and all, also the rare axle seal 

so you are just trying to split the case halves, right?   and all the bolts 
are out?   there isn't a hidden one anywhere?  so At this point I use a 
hammer and a flat chisel- I am not sure what you call it- the end of the 
chisel
