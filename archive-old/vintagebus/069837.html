&gt;With this I have found that my bus isn't level from side to side - it looks to

A week or so back I raised the rear of my wife's VW THING an equal amount 
on both sides. When I put it all back together and got it on the ground, 
the driver's side sat noticable higher. I thought I'd have to go back and 
fix it, but decided to live with it for a while. After driving it to work 
and back, the car evened out. So now it's level in the back.

Maybe your bus just needs to settle in a little bit.
