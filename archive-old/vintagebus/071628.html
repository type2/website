Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Dual Carbs need Help

How old are they?
Over time, the butterfly valves can become worn near the throttle shaft.

Take off each carb, and with the throttle fully closed (adjuster screws
backed off all the way) shine a flashlight down the barrel and look in the
other end. If you can see light around the butterfly near the throttle
shaft, it's time for new butterly valves.

If one carb responds to idle adjustments more than the other, then you will
probably see more light through one carb than the other.
