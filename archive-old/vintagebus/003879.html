Subject: Rachel &amp; Jon

  Hi Volks,
 Rachel Hollis &amp; Jon have broken down in Kingman, AZ.  Sounds like a rod =
is trying to switch sides!  They are being towed down to Havasu as we =
speak, er type.  They'll be staying here with Liz &amp; I and riding in the =
back of our Single Cab from Havasu to Jerome in the morning, ( should I =
tell them the last two people that rode back there had to push us to a =
gas station, hmmm?  What do you guys think, Dan and Erin?).
 Wish us all luck,
   Lou &amp; Liz
P.S. I did tell them about our drooling dog Max, the Boxer, though!
