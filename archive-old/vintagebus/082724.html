Subject: Jets Brosol 30/31 1600 dual port bus

Hi,
Here is my setup : 1600 dual port camper (1971) with Brosol 30/31.
Right now a 009, but soon to have a stock dizzy. I bought the bus
jetted like this
- main : 120
- air correction : 125Z
- idle : gf65
- power jet : GF50 or GF 30 (I was not able to read well)

Tailpipe has plenty of black stuff. Power up hills with WOT at high
rpm seems low. Around town fuel efficiency is ~16mpg. However the
jetting is not the only one at fault for the low mpg. Puling off stops
in first always requires some revving (could be a 009 thing).

Rob and Dave at this website :
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwresource/jets#30 explain that this
combination of idle/main jet was chosen to fit emissions requirement.
They explain that for a 1600 engine 55 idle/125 main or 55 idle/127.5
main are a better combination. They say 65 idle is too rich, and 120
main is too lean.

Anyone fiddled with jets on their H30/31 with 1600 dual port would
like to tell me a success story ? Also, where can I buy jets for the
Brosol ?

P.S. I'm totally new to jetting but it looks like a cool thing to play with

thanks - Arnaud
