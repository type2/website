Greetings Vw Friends:

I own a 67 21DLX with '14 rims. The clips on one of my rear rims was not
holding the hub cap properly so that that it would &quot;throw&quot; the cap at speed
at the slightest bump in the road. I bought some clips which seemed much
stronger that the originals, however, when I riveted them on, the new clips
would not hold the cap in place at all and would &quot;pop&quot; the cap right back at
me, not holding the cap at all.

It there a tip that would help the clips retain the hub cap properly? &quot;Help
me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round...&quot;
(sung to the tune of &quot;Help&quot; by the Beatles).

Cordially,
