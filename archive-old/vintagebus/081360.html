You might want to watch that top speed. I'd get a tach and temp guage. 
Unless you've got a counterbalanced crank and upgraded transmission, you 
shouldn't be driving over 60 mph for engine longevity. Some say stock motors 
are good to 5000 RPM, others won't go over 4000, and others recommend a 3600 
limit for best results. With a temp guage you can see the temp crawl with 
increased speed. You get to know it so well you can almost tell your speed 
from the temp guage if your speedo goes out.
