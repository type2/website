So, I wonder why I was misinformed. Now I feel Like a jerk broadcasting bad
info. Sorry people. I guess trust but verify.

Thanks Ronnie

  JC Whitney has 17 single port heads left in stock
If you need them buy them, they did say they have more on order. 3 of my
suppliers/importers are out and have been for the last 3 months. 1 of them
has 80 coming from Germany and will only allow me to buy 6 total. I did
order 4 from JC Whitney for peace of mind as I need more then that right
now.
  I was informed though that Auto Linia is going to start making them (they
make EMPI and CB Performance heads along with the aluminum blocks)

ronnie

ps. If you can find them from one of the mag ads for under 124.95 I would
buy them, I just don't have the time to call them all to see if they do have
any

I talked to J.C. Whitney rep this afternoon and they say that the supplier
they get there new SP and DP heads says that they have 11,000 pairs of SP
heads. He refused to tell me the name of the supplier though. And George is
right, all of the new Mexican and Brazilian 041 DP heads ARE thicker and
have a longer reach plug hole. I measured one of my new ones to one of the
old heads on the shelf ready to goto rebuild.

With all of the rebuilds out there, I doubt that the SP head will go away
anytime soon. I still have a fresh set of 373's on the shelf along with
three sets of rebuilds.
