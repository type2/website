I hope since you sprayed the paint, you know what type you sprayed.  Is it a
single stage or a two stage.  If it is a two stage, you MUST clear coat it.
Of course, if you sprayed a two stage, the first stage is very dull and
doesn't look finished till you clear it.  If it is a single stage, you
shouldn't need to clear it.  You will need to color sand and buff it to make
it smoother and shinier.

Go to http://www.autobodystore_dot_com for all the answers though.  You will find
the correct answers there as BB is loaded with professional painters.

&gt; the bus!):
&gt; 1. should you put a coat of clear acrylic over a fresh metallic paint job.

&gt; should I clear coat it anyway while its still masked and in &quot;painting mode&quot;
&gt; 2. can you / should you lightly sand a metallic
