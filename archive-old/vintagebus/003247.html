&gt;[Luis A. Pieretti] Hey NQ. One quick one. What is the size of
&gt;engine you are going to set those IDF into

Okay everyone - these carbs are going on a 1776 with a 110 cam and stock DP
heads.

I finished the bottom end of one carb tonight.  I had to stop since my carb
cleaner bucket will only hold part of one carb at any given time.

I was able to install CB's new venturis with the fuel rail in it and the
first thing I'm noticing between CB's venturis and the 28mm ones that were
in there before is that CB's are a helluva lot bigger.  Instead of a funnel
shaped looking tube of the stock venturis, CB's just go straight down.  Must
be something involved with this new fuel rail setup which turned out to be a
pretty painless installation.

Okay - for the tech part of it:  I'm going to put Ronnie of Kymco and CB's
jet sizes down below.

Kymco Air Correction    =    180
CB                               =    180

Kymco Main Jet    =    160
CB                        =    160

Kymco Idle Jet     =    155
CB                     =    Not Included with kit

So it looks like Ron and CB pretty much agree on what to use.  It does
bother me that CB doesn't allow you to choose your own jets but maybe this
is just a good combination that seems to work well across the board.  These
carbs came from Peter Davy of New Zealand and he said they were jetted for a
1600cc engine.  I guess you CAN run these on a stock 1600 engine because the
jets I pulled out were all way smaller than what is needed for the 1776.  I
had a 115 idle jet, 170 A/C, and 150 main.  It ran a tad rich but the sound
of them carbs when I ran them on that crappy engine last November was
absolutely wonderful!

Hope this helps some of you out...

NQ
