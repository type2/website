Subject: RE: [VB] Re: steering box gear oil

	I bought one off a gentlemen that had a couple on thesamba_dot_com
used for 50 bucks and it worked like a champ yesterday for a couple
hours of driving to a car show in Pismo Beach CA. That show is a cool
event even though there are only a couple of VW's in it each year it is
a big draw of people 30 to 40 thousand people showed up for all the hot
rods this year.

	Yes I will have to hit the gym now or buy another bus with bad
steering to get my exercise :-) 

Thanks for asking

So tell us who's steering box you used, but now you will have to go by
the
gym on the way home to get your exercise
P &amp; C


&gt; I put the new
&gt; steering box in and a new drag link in just in case and it drives like
a
&gt; dream.
