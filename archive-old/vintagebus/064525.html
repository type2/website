Subject: Re: [VB] CW crank and flywheel

It's pretty inexpensive to get the old one machined. Might as well make
use of the 8 dowels. Most aftermarket 8 dowels are lightened, not good
for buses as much. For DYI, there is a tool to jig it and drill it, for
like 35.00, or pay a little less at Rimco or elsewhere good.

&gt; 
&gt; My question however, concerns the flywheel. The SCAT crank is 8 dowel and there is nothing wrong
&gt; with my stock flywheel. Should (or can) I just remove 4 dowels from the new crank? If not, should I
&gt; get a new FW or get the old one machined?
