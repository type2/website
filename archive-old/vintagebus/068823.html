Subject: Re: [VB] Pass side mirror door hinge stud stuck

&gt; I have ground off the top mushroom part and tried to bang it (very hard)
&gt; both up and down and will no luck at all, zero movement.  I seems to have
&gt; rusted and bonded together, typical.
&gt;
&gt; If I recall correctly someone mentioned that one of the solutions is to just
&gt; plain old drill right through the pin?  I doubt an easy-out will work at
&gt; all.

Adrian I can tell you from experience that you will not be able to drill
it. I think it may be some alien alloy. I have whacked and drilled and
torched a hinge and although I had also cut off the mushroom I could not
make another mark in it.
