&gt; I think the vinyl is too &quot;today&quot; looking. You need to find one of those old
&gt; timer sign painters that know the sign art of the 50's-60's and paint a retro
&gt; look sign on the panel.  there's nothing like the old school approach to
&gt; commerical signage.

I'm with Kerry; years ago I bought a 1950 Ch*vy Pickup truck and had a local sign
painter paint the doors with my son's name, the &quot;empty weight&quot; of the truck and
the legend &quot;Not for Hire&quot;. This was required in Illinois in the 50's and I wanted
the original legal requirements on my truck. It looked great from the start, with
the brush marks and slight imperfections that hand work always shows, and now
years later with the fading that's occurred it looks even better. Recently I've
been considering vinyl graphics for the side of my Westy, the computer generated
stuff can be amazing, but to keep it true to the era of the bus, I believe you
have to go hand-painted.
