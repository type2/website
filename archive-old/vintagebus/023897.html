Subject: Bus suddenly running bad

The bus was running great.  I let it sit for a week, and when I drove it
again, it wouldn't idle at all (like, died really quickly
after letting up on the gas).  Sitting behind the bus revealed that even
at high RPM it wasn't running that well.

Things I looked at:

vaccuum leaks (none found, but this likely wouldn't affect higher RPMs)
distributor (009, advanced properly)
distributor cap (replaced with spare)
Pertronics (replaced with spare points)
spark plugs (replaced with a spare set)
plug wires (replaced with a spare set)
carb adjustment (34-pic3 nothing made a hoot of difference)
carb electromagnetic cutoff (worked)
valves (hydraulic, but adjusted to contact + 1/2, none were soft)

I can get the engine to run by opening up the throttle by placing the
throttle screw on the outside most piece of the
choke sprocket.  It still runs badly even like this.

Anyone have any suggestions?  I'm going to take the carb apart tonight
to see if there is anything
there (carb is fairly new &lt; a year old) and blow out the jets.

Suggestions most welcome.

...Markus (and Tardis)
