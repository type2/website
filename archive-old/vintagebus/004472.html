Subject: Update on my Magic Bus.

Had to do it since I love reading these myself.
So here is the update as of yesterday:

And the '63 is getting better. Like I said previously I'm working on the
nose where all the dents have been pulled and otherwise kicked out. Slight
coat of bondo covered all the imperfections. Corners and lower skirt on the
nose will be replaced with new sheet metal as it's all too far gone. I just
don't want to bondo it, paint and then find out that it cracks and falls off
later. That's why I stripped the entire roof of off paint and grinded out
all the rusty &quot;circles&quot;, all to bare metal then slightly filled with some
putty to even the surface out a bit. You got to remember that this bus
originally was imported to Seattle and then spent most of it's life in the
Midwest and last few years has been abused while sitting in the field. In
the meantime I cleaned the entire engine bay off of gunk and grime that was
left there (no sand blasting there) and I'm ready to paint it first with
rust preventative epoxy primer and then with some nice, white heat paint.
Still have to fill the hole in the battery tray. And also I took the front
end apart. Wheels off, drums off, all the brake hardware off, all lines out,
MC out, cables disconnected, tie rods and drag link almost disconnected (I
need a puller to do this), shocks off and damper off. Then I cleaned the
remaining undercoating and all the gunk and grease that accumulated over the
years and cut out rust spots to prepare for new sheetmetal. I had to do it
after looking at the job NQ did on his busse's front end. Unfortunately the
welder I bought doesn't work so I have to get my money back for it and get
another one. Perhaps I can get one from a guy in the neighborhood that
bought a MIG a few years ago and never took it out of the box. I hope so. In
the meantime I bought bumpers, front brand new with overriders but no deluxe
trim although there all holes in the bumper for it. I guess I'll buy some
later perhaps at one of the shows which I'll attend as soon as I find more
time. Rear bumper is also deluxe but used and in poor condition but
straight. It has overriders, deluxe trim and even splash pans. I can deal
with that. Also new Euro spec headlights, used wiper arms that I had to do
some work to, used front mat and some brand new rubber. Mirror arms came in
too a couple of days ago as well as taillight lenses. I reconditioned the
turn signal assemblies but had to throw lenses out. That's OK for now. So
actually as You can see I've done a lot but when you look at what's ahead it
seams like nothing. For now I just don't see the results. Perhaps that's why
I said that I'm stuck in first gear before? A lot has been done, a lot
ahead. I just want to do it right the first time. I'm a type of guy that has
the patience to work on something till I drop and still wouldn't get bored.
That's all for now. I hope You liked what you read.

PS. Well, good luck with all your busses and remember that one day you'll
just fall in love with them. When I know you are a bit discouraged sometimes
because they always brake down and need work but believe me, every one of
these babies out there needs work unless you're ready to spend $20k.

Had to do it to make you all feel better.
