I just went on a road trip and wrote down some of my speeds and RPM's. Last
night I went to the trans/speed calculator and checked my recordings to see
what the calculator said they should be and they were within 200 RPM of
these. I also called VDO (today) and checked with them on Tach variances and
being I'm pulling power off the direct power wire they could not see a
problem with power to the tach and if there was a voltage drop the Tach
would read LESS RPM's then actual. I am also using the VDO recommended
shielded wire to make sure I'm not getting any electrical interference.
Sounds like a lot of s_at_it to go through to find out what my engines doing.

&gt;Do you have a ton of other gizmos in the bus? Like a slammin' stereo, or
&gt;lots of gauges, or extra lights?  I've found that any or all of the above
&gt;can drastically change tach readings, fwiw.

Sounds like a voltage regulator for the tach would be in order.  Don't
know how much current a tach pulls but I can't imagine it would be over
one amp, so an LM317 or 7812 would probably work.  Only drawback here is
the 1.3 volts or so bias the regulator would need, so to put exactly 12
volts to your tach, you'd need to make sure the input voltage was at
least 13.3 - probably not hard to do except maybe at idle.  Doing this
would at least take one variable out of the equation.
