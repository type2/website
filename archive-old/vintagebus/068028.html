Subject: my long lost bus, a sighting...

Did anyone on the list see &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot; ?  An independent film
with Ryan Gosling and David Morse that played on the Sundance channel
the last week of January. My '69 Dormobile had a prominent part, it was
filmed here in Montana the year before a house fire claimed my baby.
There are pix of the aftermath of the fire at:

in the &quot;fire&quot; folder.
It was good to see some shots of her prior to her death...
