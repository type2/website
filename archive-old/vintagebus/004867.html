Well, here you go guys and girls. You probably know already about my
problems in getting out to OKC to pick up my new bus. Well, I can't do it. I
know I'm gonna loose my deposit but there is no way that I can go to
Oklahoma to pick this Bus up. Before I even contact anybody else I would
like to let all of you know about this baby.

65 Bus in very good original condition from original owner. The bus has been
sitting since it's engine blew in 1976. Engine is gone. Everything else is
there. Go get it. I can't. My car got stolen then I decided to go anyway but
the truck I was going to tow the bus with broke down. It's still sitting in
the garage waiting for parts. I started on the front end and it looks like
brakes got to be done too and just last night I stripped shock mounting bolt
so some more parts are needed. No way in the world I will be able to get the
bus.

Bus is in Oklahoma City. The guy was asking $1500.00 for the bus. It's worth
more than that. Contact me if you're interested and I'll get you in touch
with him.

Later,

Andre
