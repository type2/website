&gt; What's a good test to make sure the thermostat is keeping them open when
&gt; the engine is up to operating temp?

Hi Steve,
Ray's methods are great, but if you are trying to figure this out without 
removing the engine the best way to do this is to unbolt the thermostat when 
cold and see if its top touches the underside of the top of the bracket it 
resides in.  If you can wiggle it back and forth with the thermostat pulled 
fully upward by the return spring and the thermostat is threaded fully onto 
the rod all is well.  If not try adjusting the thermostat bracket upward 
(Early versions of this do not have a slot to allow adjusting!).  If that 
still does not do the trick most likely the curved arm that the thermostat 
rod mounts into at its top is bent.  You will need to remove the engine and 
fan shroud to bend the curved arm downward.  About a popsicle stick width 
shoud be between the curve in this curved arm and the thermostat flap it is 
attached to.  Most of the time this is bent by heavy handed mechanic shoving 
the fan shroud down forcing the rod through the head and resulting in bending 
the curved arm.
