&gt; 1. What seems to be the average cost for having a bus sprayed 2 tone?

Single stage, anywhere from $150 to $800 for the *paint*, then labor 
_at_ $PrevailingRate to get it sprayed.  Figure $25-$65/hr for the rate.
And that's just *spraying* - no other costs are figured in there.
Clearcoat add approx 30%.  These are just rough numbers.  It will vary
on how much of the bus you're painting, what color (it took 8 coats of
single-stage to cover my 60)

It cost VWHoward $1500 to get his bus painted.  I have more than that
in materials.  I think mine's shinier though!

&gt; Different methods and costs. (one shot, clearcoat jobs, interior)
&gt; 2.  How about standard fix its on the body like
&gt; 	Replacing a rocker
&gt; 	Dogleg
&gt; 	reat quarter around the tail light
&gt; 	rust under the windshield
&gt; 	rain gutters
&gt; 	floor pans

These are impossible to  quote without seeing the car.  How much does a child
cost?  Well, is it male or female?  Smart or dumb?  Yale or 8th grade dropout?
Healthy or sick?  You're getting the picture.
