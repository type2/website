None of them work as well as the originals. The plastic ones are garbage,
the metal threaded ones not much better. I have no experience with the metal
sprung ones, so can't say. It isn't bad to pull the motor and check things
out every now and then. Lots of maintenance that can be caught up at the
time.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Just wondering about sprung push rod tubes.  Are these any worse than
&gt; regular push rod tubes?  I've seen plastic and metal versions, and I'd
&gt; opt for the metal ones, but maybe the plastic ones are better?  It seems
&gt; like these would be better for faster oil leak repairs be it roadside or
&gt; in the garage
