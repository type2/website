Additional information on this yard liquidation:

This is a VW only yard in W. Columbia South Carolina. I
talked to the Owner, Cody.  He is closing the yard in one
week.  After that, EVERYTHING will be crushed!
Not too many  older VW's left, but he did say there was at
least one split camper there, sans front windows.  Not sure
what kind. I forgot to get an address, but the business # is
(803)791-8189.  The other # is his home.  He sounds like he
just wants to get on with his retirement...the kid he sold
it to ran it into the ground and he had to take it back.
Cuttin' in on his golf time he told me.

If anyone is going to go take a look would you
please let me know.  I'd be interested in the camper stuff
if any.  E-mail me at swharris_at_earthlink_dot_net

Happy Hunting!
