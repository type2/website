Hi Adam,
The two bottom bolts as you put it should really be a pair of studs threaded 
into the lower part of the engine case and fastened to the tranny by a pair 
of nuts.  As for the upper bolts you are refering to as loosening actually 
you are removing and wrenching on a pair of nuts there!  The bolts from 
through the tranny bell housing are in the same place as your 69 bus.  They 
just do not have the fancy 3/4 moon shaped bolt heads with corrosponding flat 
locking places cast into the tranny case.  Check second picture in section 
M-2, page 2 of the VW bus 1963-67 bus shop manual.  If you do not have this 
manual get an original set or the Bentley reprint before you are lost!  Opps, 
too late!  ;-)  Make sure to have a floor jack under the engine sump plate 
and slightly jack up the engine to take it's wieght off the VW.  Then have a 
friend wrench on those upper nuts inside the engine compartment while you 
slide under the bus on the left side just forward of the rear wheel.  Do the 
starter top bolt first on the right side of the tranny.  You can not 
effectively get to the head of this bolt from the right side of the tranny so 
one has to reach over the top of the tranny get a feel of the rotating head 
of the bolt and slide a 17mm wrench on to lock it!  Once you have that apart 
repeat the same process for the left upper engine bolt/nut.  Once you have 
the engine out we advise having a nut welded to the side of the starter bolt 
head and a bolt welded onto to left upper bolt head to lock these from 
spining during future engine installation/removal sessions.   Eric&amp;Barb
