I've

Not too much changed except that there are less and less of these things on
the road today. It's harder to get parts (original parts). Every now and
then some crazy event draws attention to Busses and in fact raises prices as
well. Good thing though that there are many young people getting that urge
to own one, to work on one. Somehow it stays around. For how long though? My
son is 7 now, he loves Busses but will he be interested in them later? I
guess it's all up to me.

Parts? Isaiah I found a few people that were willing to send me parts for
free, that's not an issue here. I even got a 6V starter and just covered
shipping. Problem arises when you send someone the part they are looking for
and they turn around and sell it to another guy for a profit.

Hope it all stays the same and that new micro does not cause a stir by
raising prices of old busses.
