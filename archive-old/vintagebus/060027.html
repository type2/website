Subject: Re: Slash rear bumper

Steve &amp; Clara --

If you really want to change to a slash rear bumper, I'd be happy to trade
the one presently with my '67 Deluxe, since I should really have a pointy
one instead. Mine's a Deluxe bumper in good shape and lousy PO paint, and
right now it's totally diassembled in preparation for refinishing. I also
have a second &quot;slash&quot; blade with torched-out peashooter holes. Let me know.
I'm in the Phila. Pa. area, and I imagine shipping isn't cheap...

As long as we're talking bumpers, everyone, I'm looking for a good front
bumper &quot;pipe&quot; (aka towel rack); mine is totally dinged up and bent.

Are the repro bumpers the slash style? I can't tell from the catalog photos.
A while back there was a post asking about the quality of the repro bumpers,
and whether the various parts fit with the OG parts or not -- I never saw a
public reply. Has anyone had any experience with these?

&gt;
&gt; I am still reviewing all my parts I got with my 65 DC. I am in bumper mode
now.
&gt;
&gt; I have a slash front bumper, which I think is correct, but I have a
pointed end rear bumper. I think
&gt; this is a 66-67 part based on what is on Wade's site.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a slash rear bumper they want to sell or trade for a
pointed end?
