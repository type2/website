Subject: window rubber Q

Okay y'all,

Quick question,  I removed my cab door today because they need a little 
work, and part of that was removing the old rubber on the window frames.  
The rubber that goes on top of the window frame that makes a seal with the 
bus itself, part of it runs through a channel on the top of the window 
frame.  When i pulled the rubber off, it cracked, and left the part in the 
channel still in the channel.  Anyone who has replaced rubber on windows 
hopefully knows what I am talking about.  How do I get the remaining strip 
of rubber out of the channel in the window frame?  It looks like it should 
just slide out, any tricks for &quot;convincing&quot; it to come out easy?
