Subject: 1967 bus for sale at fire sale price of $150

Wanna buy a bus cheap? My hand, Scott, has a 1967 bus for sale for $150. He 
has
to move it outa my shop by Monday,  January 21 to make room for my new 1956 
on a 1954 pan which is being delivered Monday. Price is negotiable. The bus 
has no engine. Otherwise, it is in good condition. He had an offer on it for 
$500, but that never came thru. Now he has to move it.

Please contact Scott Jones at home at 972-395-9740 or at the shop at 
972-642-6671.
we are located in the Dallas, Texas area. Scott lives in Carrollton and I 
live in Dallas.
My number is 214-979-0373, if you want me to intercede. You come pick it up 
by Monday.
