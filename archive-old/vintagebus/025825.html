&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I just checked RAMVA to see if anything exciting was going on in that
&gt; neck of the WWW.  Surprisingly I found that the new editor of VW trends
&gt; joined and asked how his first magazine was.  I don't know if any of the
&gt; rest of you are interested,
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought.

To All,        First of all the old editor of VW Trends is a friend of
mine,so I'm  a bias reader.
As a bus lover, I know we lost an editor who loves buses!!!! and we are left
with some
chump who can't even keep his bug running and who hasn't driven one in
years!!! I still don't understand his logic in writing his first
editorial.Does he want us to hate him?
        Henry did not get demoted, on the contrary .He really likes his new
position and if he is happy that is great, but the rest of us have to read a
magazine that is now run by non VW guy and a non BUS guy!! A double lose to
the bus community.Did you ever notice how many buses were in trends compared
to hotvws?That was because of Henry!
            my rant for the day.

                woody

ps.This is strictly my opinion but I bet that trends starts catering more
and more to the water cooled market again.
Specifically the new beetle owners. my 2 cents.
