Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Pump won't pump fuel.

Chris,
Thanks for the suggestion, you are right, I did need to prime the pump, I
did it by filling the pump with fuel, then holding my finger over the
discharge tube until pressure brought fuel through the pump, then I hooked
up the line and the filter filled up.
One problem I found, that I had overlooked before was that the accelerator
cable tube through the fan shroud had slipped out and was jammed against the
accelerator linkage in the carb, when I pumped the gas pedal, the cable
flexed, but there was no action in the carburetor. Once I corrected the
tube, and primed the pump, the engine started and things are back to normal.
I sure appreciate your help.

&gt; Here's another thing to consider:  after all the fuel line and fuel pump
&gt; cleaning you did, it may be necessary to prime the pump.  I recently
&gt; rebuilt the original pump for my 67 DC (single screw on top) and also
&gt; replaced the piece of metal fuel line that goes into it.  Bus wouldn't
&gt; fire up after that, no gas coming out of the pump.  I took off the top
&gt; of the pump, filled it with gas, replaced top and recranked.  I did this
&gt; twice, and then it started back up and has been running fine since.

&gt; &gt; Yesterday my '66 quit about a block from home. I towed it home and found
&gt; &gt; that there was no fuel coming into the pump. I took out the cloth line
and
&gt; &gt; replaced it, I ran a wire through the steel line and got some sediment
from
&gt; &gt; the line that was probably causing the blockage. I took my air
compressor
&gt; &gt; hose and blew through the fuel line to ensure that it is clear, fuel
runs
&gt; &gt; freely into the pump. I also removed the fuel pump, cleaned and
reassembled
&gt; &gt; it, there was no visible problem with the screens, membranes or springs.
I
&gt; &gt; reinstalled the pump, replaced the cloth fuel line and fuel filter to
the
&gt; &gt; carburetor. Clamped everything down and turned the engine...no fuel from
the
&gt; &gt; pump. I took off the pump and as a test, I replaced it with a pump from
a
&gt; &gt; recently running engine, same style pump, the one with four screws at
the
&gt; &gt; top and the conical shaped screen behind the brass nut on the side.
&gt; &gt; With the second pump there is still no fuel coming out. I took off the
pump
&gt; &gt; and checked the connecting rod, it rises and falls as the engine turns.
&gt; &gt; I'm stumped, any one got a suggestion???
