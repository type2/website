Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Question on my '67....

Hi Scott,
Glad we could help!  Make sure to check out the headlight rebuild article we 
and Matt Roberds wrote up in the type 2 library.  Doing that and soldering all 
the brass clips in the fuse box together made our headlights much brighter 
and the rest of the electrical system work faster, better.
