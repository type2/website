Subject: Re: [VB] was Couple new items now window latchs

What I've heard, and believe is the non drilled glass is non tempered, so
if it was drilled, it would break that's why the latches are in the
slides.

I've had Buses as new as '66 with those and as early as '56. I think it's
more of a destination thing then a year thing.

At any rate it's good to have the felts now.
