&gt; I wouldnt if i were you.
&gt; But if you want to it really is easy. [snip]

&gt; Where is the logic here? You wouldnt do it the correct way with a part
&gt; designed for just such a purpose but you would advise a kludge as a better
&gt; solution?

I think he meant he wouldn't remove the electromagnetic cut-off. He added
that there was no need to buy a part to do it, just cut the plunger off,
which I have seen done a million times. It appeared to me that he thought a
better solution was to leave it alone.
