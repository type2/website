Subject: Bus buying scams

Hi,

I have been off list for a while but I wanted to check in and find 
out if there are any known Internet bus buying scams that are popular 
at the moment. I also want to pass on some odd buyers I have 
encountered.

I have my bus listed on www.thesamba_dot_com and www.type2_dot_com. I have 
received  several strange e-mails from people stating that they are 
brokers or collectors. One persistent fellow wants to buy the bus 
sight unseen with a cashiers check and send an agent to pick it up. 
The catch is he wants to send a cashiers check for $10,000 and have 
me mail back one for the difference between the check and the selling 
price of the bus. Yeah, right.

Another fellow claims to be a&quot; west German &quot;(sic) residing in west 
Africa. He has an _at_aol_dot_com address. Should I tell him Germany has 
reunified and he can go home? Perhaps he is legit but.........

If anyone is truly interested I will forward you the correspondence. 
so you can be on the lookout. The cynical among you make accuse me of 
being overly suspicious but I would only call your cynicism into 
question for that accusation :)

Thanks
Chris
