Ted,

Have you had bad dealings with Ron or something?  I ask because it seems
like he honestly wanted to help, and was even willing to eat the 2% credit
card fees, and you publicly ridiculed him for the idea.  Not a way to win
friends and influence people, I assure you.  What harm could POSSIBLY come
from allwing Ron to help out?  I don't get your attitude.

Tom

&gt;think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted
