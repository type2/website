You sent me those, but I thought they were for big nut only.  Could be my
problem.  I put seals in two years ago with no problems.  Now two in a row
leaked, but I did use the kit seals, not the blue ones you sent!
I must have misinterpreted what you said about the blue seals.  I was
saving them for my big nut trans.
