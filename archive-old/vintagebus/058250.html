&gt; 
&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; Referencing this picture:
&gt; http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/images/bbthighroof.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; Dave &amp; I were discussing the chances of a bullet-signalled high-roof
&gt; being an OG factory item yesterday and didn't really come to a
&gt; conclusion. With that in mind, I wanted to pose the following questions
&gt; to our esteemed listees:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) What year was the factory high-roof first available?
&gt; 2) What is the M-Code for this package?
&gt; 3) Were many ambulances done in a high-roof package?
&gt; 4) Were the windows in a high-roof normally positioned against the
&gt; belt-line or the roof? (They were welded over on this one.)
&gt; 5) How hard is it to find ambulance innards? (Besides &quot;Very VERY&quot;.)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info,
&gt;
