&gt; How many different lengths of heater cable are there?  Is one side longer
&gt; than the other?  Which one?

Hi Steve,
Only one length!  We have installed heater cables in our 1963 SC and 1960
walk thru panel camper conversion.  The trick is to bend the cable in the
correct
place in the middlish and can take a couple of tries.
  Probably the best way is to remove the heater knob and feed the cable in
both tubes.  Once the ends are through the back Vise-Grip each end to keep
them
from slipping back into the cable tubes and pull on the middle with a hook
or
perhaps a piece of coat hanger put on the cable before installing it, to get
the exact place for the knob/pin connection.
   Also are you using the heater boxes for pre-1968 buses or the later bus
ones where the swing arms of the heater boxes are much higher than the
earlier
style and thusly will not work with the stock cable or in a pre-1968 bus
properly.
