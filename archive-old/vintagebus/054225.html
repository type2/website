Subject: Re: [VB] how comfortable is a vintage bus for a large human being?

Matthew,
I am 6'4&quot;, 300 lbs. I am very comfortable behind the wheel of my
walk-through 66, a little more cramped behind the wheel of a bench seat
model.
Speaking to reliability, you get out of a bus what you put in, I find that
if I neglect my bus it gives me problems, the upside of this is that the
problems are easily solved with tenacity, the Idiot Book and help from this
list.
rest assured that there are no black boxes or computers to inexplicably go
south on you.
I drive my bus every day, and occasionally run into trouble, but I have a
2000 Beetle and have trouble with that too, the only difference is, the
beetle is $500.00 a shot at the dealership, the bus is a couple of hours of
concentration and a few bucks for parts.
I would recommend a bus anytime over an SUV or anything else for that
matter.

In Jan., my wife and I will be outnumbered by our children, and so we
require a larger vehicle. Although an SUV is an option, neither of us are
sure that it is the best option. By a stroke of genius - ?!?! - we thought
we oughta consider a vintage bus. This would be an &quot;every day driver&quot; -- and
I *am* concerned about the *reliability* of an old bus; but before this
concern comes my concern that I, at 6' 5&quot;, might not fit behind the wheel of
one of these buses.

Can anyone speak to - and hopefully allay - this concern?...

Other thoughts / suggestions / advice would also be *much* appreciated.

Thanks,
Matthew Weymar
