Hey list--
I picked up a set of ambulance fans today from someone I met in Eugene...
The cover plate is chrome (tha whole thing) w/ a white knob!!! I've never 
seen them like that before... have you guys?
How do you change the bulb in the switch? Is there a screw I am not seeing or 
something? 
Take care--
Pete
