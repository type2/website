I have one, it was mounted on a fool injected Beetle.
It's a &quot; flux capacitor&quot;- This &quot;squirrel torque&quot; multiplier
may not provide the 1.8 gigawatts needed to propel
your bus to the prerequisite 88 mph, but at least they
won't lose their nuts trying.
I think this needs some &quot;Clara-fication&quot;.
I was under the assumption that it was a venturi, but
from Ray's description, it doesn't sound like a speed part.

&gt; A real collectors piece, most of those don't make it into the country
since
&gt; hardly anyone in the US wants VW industrial motors. They were intended for
&gt; motors that run at a single speed for long periods at a time and acted
like
&gt; kind of a governor for the air. The engines rarely operated over 3600 rpm,
&gt; most around 2800-3200 rpm. My VolksAir air compressor operates at 2400 rpm
and
&gt; will probably outlast me!
