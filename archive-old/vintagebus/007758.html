Subject: Canadian VW Parts
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 22:48:13 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does anyone know of a list of sources for VW parts in Canada?  Ordering from
the US is often sketchy thanks to our friends at Canadian Customs - ya just
never know how long things will take to get through nor what kind of
brokerage fees people like UPS will charge (they once charged my brokerage
fees of $35 (Can) on $50 (US) worth of parts).

So,  if there is a good list of Canadian parts sources please let me know,
and if there isn't then lemme know where ya shop (in Canada) and I'll put
together a list.

There has to be a better Canadian source than California Imports in Burnaby,
they told me last Wednesday that I should have my stuff by Friday, turns out
they hadn't even shipped the stuff by Monday.

TIA
