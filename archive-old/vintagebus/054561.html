Subject: Re: [VB] BUMPERS FOR MY 56

again you are correct. i guess i am still in the &quot;user&quot; train of thought,
and not in the &quot;show car&quot; train of thought. 
i can just see rachel putting the fiberglas bumpers on her truck and
destroying them within months, due to dump runs, small driveways, cement
barriers in parking lots, other cars in parking lots not knowing how to
drive, etc... if these factors were not part of daily use reality, then all
bumpers would be perfect to begin with.
the repro fiberglas ones are fine, and look very nice, but i just don't
think they are the ultimate solution to the daily grind. i'm sure they'd be
fine for vehicles that get driven onto trailers, or only a few miles to a
local show. 
i have really straight bumpers on my shiny bus ('61 westy) and when i
bought the bus they were all painted and nice. after only a year of daily
driving, they already have scratches and dings, and i know i've been bumped
more than once and have whacked them with a toolbox and other parts. i
think if they were fiberglas, i'd have nice piles of costly trash on my
hands.
i guess it all boils down to your particular application and needs. i agree
that ronnie's are a good option, no doubt. some people might not want to go
that way, simply because their busses get driven, and driven hard.

&gt; err, uh, yeah but....if you have to pay to have the metal ones
straightened
&gt; you could just buy another new fiberglass one for the same or less money.
&gt; If you can find originals at a good price that don't need straightening
then
&gt; yeah, go that way.  If not, Ronnies are a good option.

&gt; &gt; ..until you bump into something. =)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; seriously, there are plenty of decent metal ones available at fair
prices
&gt; &gt; (for 45 year old parts). i've even seen nos ones recently at not bad
&gt; &gt; prices. 

&gt; &gt; &gt; [Original Message]
&gt; &gt; &gt;..... has them in fiberglass at a fraction of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; price of the originals..  Once they are painted you cannot tell the
&gt; &gt; &gt; difference.
