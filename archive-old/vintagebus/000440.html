&lt;&lt; So, the only 71-79 MC available, part number 211 611 021AA, is for the
 power servo system.  It has a shaft sticking out instead of the hole for
 the pushrod.  Is this really the part I want for the conversion?  Does
 the shaft come out? &gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
Yes, that is the MC you will need to do the conversion and the reason you 
need a shorter pushrod and having a spacer is a good idea.  
   First though before you go out and buy the newer MC you really should 
remove your old 1967 dual MC.  Dissassemble it and clean it out.  From what 
you describe it is most likely thay it is just full of sludge from road dust 
and maybe just needs a little polishing of the bore which you can do with 
just you hand and sandpaper.   Eric&amp;Barb
