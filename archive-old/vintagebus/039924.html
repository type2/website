&gt;T&gt;Hello All, Today I was looking through my parts for some 15&quot; rims, I have
&gt;one that I'm pretty sure is for a bus, but does not (and never did) have
&gt;hubcap clips, but instead has three &quot;notches&quot; that would hold a hubcap on.
&gt;The rim is wider than a Beetle rim, and has the same &quot;slots&quot; like a bus
&gt;rim....
&gt;Any ideas??
&gt;T.I.A.

A type 3 ghia rim maybe?
Jason
