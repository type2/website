Well, since its Friday, and we're talkin batteries, I'll step out of my
usual style and brag a bit about my battery!

In 1981, I walked into JC Penney Auto store to buy a new battery for the
67. The guy told me as he installed it, that it has a lifetime warranty
for the life of the car. I half didn't believe it, but smiled as I thought
of my lifetime commitment to keep the 67 alive - I figured 'sure, another
sales gimmick'. Well, 6 years later, it died, and I went to the nearest
Penneys and they gave me another one, NEW, more capacity, the whole bit. 

Well, last year I needed a new one again, no questions asked! This time I
requested a type 24. Maintenance free, with a handle it has! 

They didn't know what they were getting into when they offered me that
warranty!

;-)
