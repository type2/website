The thread continues...

I finally went and purchase a whole new doghouse fan shroud with flaps and
thermostat rod intact.  Anyway, I compared the rods and found them to be the
same length with only slight variance... humm.  Got a second thermostat
bracket, all the same too...

Ok, I'll go ahead and assemble it and compare as I go... BINGO!  I found
that the flap &quot;hoop&quot; that connects to the rod was bent out at least 1/4 inch
more on the one that had the flaps too far open (at cold).

Here is a photo:

Did they make these different or is the one I have just bent, most likely
when it was pulled out?

From what I can tell, the proper gap is only about 1/8 of an inch.. mine had
3/8 to 1/2 of an inch.
