Subject: popin' outa 4th

hi list

So as the subject says - I'm a popin' outa 4th.  So I've been looking
around locally for someone who rebuilds trannies (a mechanic not a
european doctor) and it looks like I won't find any one who can do it.
It seems likely that I could find a used one but that's too much work
for a maybe.  So it looks like either I send off my transaxle to
someplace far away (I'm in deepest, darkest, central Canada)  to get it
fixed or I just order one from somewhere.

I was hoping that I could just order a freeway flier from someone who is
list recommended and try and figure out how to install it.  Is it that
simple?  Will it just replace mine or are there lots of modifications
involved?  Can I just use a freeway flier with my current redux boxes?
My bus is a 60 with, i think, the original transaxle.

TIA
