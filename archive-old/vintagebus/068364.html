Subject: Won't start

Hello all,

Well, I am going crazy...I pulled the engine this week to replace the
clutch. This was my first time to pull a VW engine, and doing it by myself.
Discovered a bent/ worn arm on the shaft that carries the TO bearing, and
believe this was the cause of my clutch problems.  Installed new shaft, TO
bearing, clutch disc and PP. While I had the engine out, I tightened the
carbs to the intakes, tightened the intakes to the heads, installed several
screws on the tinwork the the PO had left off, and then wiped everything
down to clean it up a little. Put it back together last night.  Went in
rather quickly, thanks for the advice from the group on using a flat,
ratcheting wrench from Sears ( They don't make a 17mm, but 11/16 is same as
17mm and ONLY $7.99!!) on that upper left nut.  (I had it back on in less
than 10 seconds!! Thanks Cal)  Adjusted the clutch as per discussion, with
1/2&quot; free play at the pedal.  Clutch feels good.

Now the damn thing won't start.  Turns over, but will not fire, not once.
A half tank of gas.  Strong battery.  I never touched the dizzy.    Seems
like I am not getting a spark??   I reconnected the 2 electrical lines.  One
goes to the oil pressure switch, the other to the coil, opposite side of the
Dist. connection, right??  When I first reconnected, I accidently put the
wire on the same side of the coil as the dizzy, but I don't think that would
do any harm.   With the key on, but started not engaged, should I get
voltage at the line that connects to the dist.??  If so, how much?  What
could have gone wrong/ what have I missed??


Any thoughts or ideas welcome!!

Bob T
