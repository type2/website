Herbie &amp; Friends Cruise Event update.
*****************************
I received this mail this evening and was asked to forward it to the
Type 2 community at large.  All within the greater LA/Ventura/San
Bernardino/Riverside/Orange Counties Area are invited.  Yep, I know
it's &quot;O-Dark Thirty&quot; on a Friday morning, but maybe a &quot;hardy few&quot;
would like a free breakfast at the beach for the effort.

Unfortunately, I will be back at &quot;Cruise HQ&quot; in Ventura, helping put
the final touches to the &quot;nuts &amp; bolts&quot; of the Karmann Ghia Treffen
(On Saturday, May 14) and the Cruise support stuff for the following
Sunday morning.  Oh well, so much for my chance at TV fame ;-)
