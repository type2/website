Lemme get this straight. This is the carburetor that
has been cussed and cursed at for years? Even in the
German spec it wasn't THAT killer of a carb. Trusty
work horses yeah but not as desirable as the 30-31's
or even as happy as the earlier 34's. This carb with
the soon to be $200 price is not the OG German carb
nor is it the Brazilian carb but the Mexican version
of the carb? Isn't this the BOCAR POS that had a slew
of them with the dime sized plugs popping out of them?
OK, I'm probably incorrect about the Mexican vs.
Brazilian source but doesn't it strike anyone other
than myself as weird that the quality of a lot of the
replacement parts keep getting more and more far
afield from the OG specs and QA/QC levels of the VWAG
parts while at the same time the prices keep going up
and the availability keeps getting more scarce.
Configurations and work-a-rounds keep getting farther
and farther from the OEM configs. Tin, dizzies, carbs,
carb rebuild kits, basic gasketry, exhaust items, fuel
filters, hubcaps, hubcap CLIPS etc...

In spite of all of the hard work and genuine and
sincere efforts that the trusty vendors put forth it
seems like even the most mundane parts are turning
into rough 'semblance of what recently was common
fare.

I continue to defend, support and encourage OUR
vendors but past a point I don't really give a damn
anymore. Hurray for- and God bless those who still
choose to carve out a living supporting/supplying our
hobbies and passions. Without them we'd be owners of
rusting lawn jockeys. Some day &lt;soon&gt; it may become
folly to depend on our air coolers for anything other
than museum examples.

To me the whole scene seems more and more like hearing
exjocks recalling memories of High School glory as
recalled at the 20 year reunion. Someday it comes to
get beyond graduation day and move on... It's like
being at a trade show at closing time and watching
stragglers grabbing the last of the free ballpoint
pens and balloons for the kiddies. 

Who's zooming who anymore?
