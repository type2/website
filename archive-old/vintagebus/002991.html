  Hi Volks,
 I am in need of a Bay fuel tank (15 gal. type).  Ronnie told me I would need a '71 and older non-fuel injected kind.  If anyone out there has said tank that is in good, please not full of rust, condition please let me know.  My plans to attend the RMMW show are on hold do to a health problem here at home but Ronnie says he would gladly bring it back for me.  They don't get any better then Ronnie for help when you're in need!
  Thank you
    Lou in Havasu
