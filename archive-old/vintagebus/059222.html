&gt;Ok, so I've got the turn signal relay hooked up and it even blinks (only
&gt;I've got to figure out why the opposite side has a faint blink when one
&gt;side is blinking).

I'd vote for either grounds at the lights (especially the rear lights)
or possibly trouble in your turn signal switch -- which wouldn't be
all that likely as you just went through yours.  Make sure you've gotten
rid of all DPO creativity on your wiring harness.  As Clara W. once
said, &quot;I have found that if there is a bunch of extra stuff, I just
pull all the added bits out, toss them out the window (best if the
buses owner is there) and hook everything up as per wiring diagram
with cleaned connections.&quot;

&gt;Now the 12V E-flasher relay that I have has the DIN numbers for
&gt;headlight wiring, so I have no idea.  Is it possible to fry it by
&gt;connecting the wrong wires?

It's hard to fry the relay, but you might fry the wires connected to
it.  Your relay probably is marked 30, 85, 86, 87, and possibly 87a.
You can hook it up per the '63 wiring diagram, hooking the 87b wire
to 87a, but it may not work right.  If it doesn't work, either the
right front turn signal light will stay on all the time, or both
front turn signal lights will flash whenever you put the turn signals
on.

The problem is that the original VW emergency light relay contacts
are wired like this:

               /
        +-----/  ----- 87
        |      /
30 -----+-----/  ----- 87b

When the contacts are closed, 87 and 87b are both connected to 30.
When the contacts are opened, 87 and 87b are not connected to anything.
Both contacts move together.

The contacts on relay you have are wired in one of two ways:

                /----- 87a
               /
30 -----------/  ----- 87

This is a &quot;change-over&quot; connection.  Either 87a or 87 is always
connected to 30.  A relay like this will make your right front turn
signal light stay on.

                   +-- 87a
               /   |
30 -----------/  --+-- 87

On this relay, 87a and 87 are actually the same terminal.  A relay
like this will make both of your front turn signals flash together
whenever the turn signals are on.

If you want to make a 12 V emergency flasher relay out of standard
parts, you can use two standard 12 V relays with 30, 85, 86, and 87
terminals.  Ignore any extra terminals.  You wire the relays in
parallel except for the 87 terminals - use one 87 terminal as 87 and
the other as 87b.  Here's a diagram:

wire to 30  -----+----- 30 (relay 1)
on original      |
relay            +----- 30 (relay 2)

wire to 85  -----+----- 85 (relay 1)
on original      |
relay            +----- 85 (relay 2)

wire to 86  -----+----- 86 (relay 1)
on original      |
relay            +----- 86 (relay 2)

wire to 87  ----- 87 (relay 1)
on original
relay

wire to 87b ----- 87 (relay 2)
on original
relay

Your original VW relay might not have an obvious connection for 85;
this is a ground and it may just happen through the metal mounting clip.
Most new relays come in plastic cases so you'll have to install short
wires from terminal 85 to ground.

Your local car stereo and alarm shop should be able to sell you the
right standard relays very cheaply, like for less than $5 each.  They
also have pre-wired pigtail sockets for $2 or so that fit the relays
and aren't required, but can help you do a neater job.

I hope this helps!
