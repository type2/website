Subject: Fan Noise

Hello out  there in bus land. I trust everybody had a good New Year. Well here it is, my first question for the New Year. My cooling fan is somehow clearancing on the doghouse and making an awful whining noise. I can give the doghouse a slight push tword the front of the vehicle and this seems to temporarily clear the noise up. I've checked the cooling tins and there is some bolts missing from the generator backing plate but replacing these would seem only to pull the doghouse more tword the rear and increase the problem. I see no other screws or bolts missing. What might cure this nasty noise? Is it possible the fan itself is not spinning true? Thanks for any assistance.
