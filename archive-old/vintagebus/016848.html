I have small nuts, only 36mm across...

Personally, I think it's the seals.  I've done enough of them over the years
that I would hope I'd got past the rookie moves that cause them to leak, like
installing them crooked, gouging, etc...

&gt; Do you have a big nut trans?  Ronnie sent me some for that that are for
&gt; IRS bug I think? to use on big nut setup.  I've had the same problem as
&gt; Thom.  It doesn't seem like
&gt; it would be that difficult to replace seals, but I've put in two and the
&gt; second leaks worse than the first.  On the second it sat for a day before
&gt; it started to leak.
