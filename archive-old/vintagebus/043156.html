If you have access to a welder.....I have had some success grinding the
threaded end of a bolt to a blunt tip and then drilling a small divot into
the end of the screw and then welding the blunt end of the bolt at the
messed up screw head.
Then while the area is still hot I will press a piece of paraffin wax
around the base.  Paraffin wax is great for loosening bolts/nuts.  
Go cautiously when trying to remove it.  Be patient and spend a couple of
days trying to get it released.  Kroil is another good penetrant you might
want to try applying over a period of a couple of days.
Good luck.
later
