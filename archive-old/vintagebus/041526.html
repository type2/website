I got info on pricing back from them.
www.whitepost_dot_com

Master cylinder sleeved and rebuilt complete (Each): 	$175.00
Wheel cylinders sleeved and rebuilt complete (Each): 	$80.00
Time in our Shop: 	about 24 hours
Shipping via Surface: 	$8.00 (per box)

For those folks with a 67 or one of the more expensive MC this seems like
a good deal as it includes bronze sleeving and rebuild. a bit expensive to
do wheel cyls though.
