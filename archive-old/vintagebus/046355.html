12W?   Tell me Thom ( can I call you Thom?)  how long does it take for the 
plastic covers to melt?

the bulbs in the back roof light in my 65 are colored (greeny blue) and since 
they are 10W I did not put the cover on it.

Have seen bulbs both longer and shorter that the regular bulbs for buses.  
The bay windows use longer bulbs.  But the right size 12V 5W bulbs are out 
there.  sometimes available at VW shows.  Pick up a couple spares when you 
find some.

 You bring up an interesting point, Clara (can I call you Clara?)
 
 I bought a whole bunch of bulbs for the panel, as I have 6 dome lights
 in it total.  All of the new 12v ones are longer than the originals,
 and I think they're 12w.  They are *very* bright, and get *very* hot -
 do I have the wrong bulbs?

 &gt; same from mid 55 (somewhat post barndoor) through 67- the aluminium bulb 
 &gt; holder - and takes the same plastic cover with which you must use 5W bulb 
of 
 &gt; the same voltage as your system because other wise the covers get melted.
