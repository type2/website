I have a little problem getting a voltage converter/inverter, so what about
I only changed the generator from 6 v to 12 v, what would the 6 v batteri
say to this ?

	Back in the days when 6v VWs were common (here I go dating myself
again),
	there were often 'voltage converter/inverter's used to run
aftermarket
	stereos, fans, etc.  You used to be able to get them fromm Radio
Shack, JC
	Whitney, and large auto supply stores.  Does anyone know if they're
still
	available?  I'd like to use one (or two) to hook up a nice stereo in
my bus
	after I convert it back to 6v.
