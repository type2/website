Subject: Re: [VB] engine

I assume you mean that the SP will deliver more torque through the power curve but the DP will rev
higher and therefore generate more HP, right?

Do you have any hard numbers for this analysis?

Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the
crankshaft and less bore.

&gt; I'm new to vw's and building a 1776 for 67std. I know that sp will run
&gt; cooler than a dp, but really do not know pro's &amp;con's of each. Any help
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.
