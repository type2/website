greg writ:


Does anyone out there know of a way to ship a canopy (tilt). I'm selling
one to a guy back East but it's been difficult finding someone to ship
the hoops. The wood and canvas is not a problem. Just the hoops. Any
ideas????

find some crazy bus person with a roof rack drivingcross country would be 
cheaper I'd say- kick down some gas money- post to the list your location and 
the final destination- surely  the guy on the other end will drive somewhat 
to pick them up
