One man's &quot;uselessness&quot; is another man/person's passion. As an owner of a
'54 Barndoor Amulance which was imported from Denmark to Los Angeles area
last Summer I can stand to comment...

Yes, the bus would be appropriate for a small target market within the VW
world. My first instinct was that hearing of a low milage complete ambulance
gave me a chubby! =) It's positive points are that is as described very
complete, low mileage and rare. On the otherhand its a serious amount of
funds to tie up into a vehicle if you can't afford it. Condition of the
mechanicals and bodywork are definite factors. The completely restored
Ambulance that I saw in years past at the VW CLassic was in my eyes really
beautiful-but is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. There is a strata of
our world's population who could afford it and very much desire it.
Unfortunately I'm far from that level. That target market will be in Bad
Camberg in June. I'll be sweating in Phoenix.

Think about it. A few years ago you couldn't give away a single cab or a
panel. Now look at the trend de jour.

Shipping via Wallenius RO/RO lines is a good way to go. Check their website
for details. Separate shipment of the small items would be recommended. At
least secure the items within sercure packages. Attempt to set up a deal
*prior* to importation.

My ambo is fun and enjoyable to my family as it has been converted to a
camper ~of sorts. It will never again be a complete and correct ambulance.
It was never a &quot;correct&quot; camper. It isn't museum perfect but is a barndoor
era bus and came with a flurry of rare bits that makes it &quot;interesting&quot;. It
is a fun bus that we like and intend to use-hopefully very soon. I'm
currently shopping for tires and am &quot;tightening up&quot; the compression &lt;inside
joke&gt;.
Best of luck with your find!
