Subject: Re: [VB] Happy 40th Birthday

How much is 40 in bus years? I'm a better cyclist than a runner and wonder how I'd look if I'd powered myself 100,000 or 200,000 miles, with most of those in my first 10 years! So you installed a pacemaker, good for you and your bus!

&gt; Well today my 66 westy turned the big four-oh. I put a CDI ignition 
&gt; system in it a few nights ago for a bday present.

OT, it's Towel Day today and Bob Day yesterday!
