Subject: VTO contact needed...

Greetings,

I will be driving out to Jerome on Friday morning from Orange County and 
wanted to meet up with the VTO guys either that morning or the night before.

If any of you are on here, I wanted to get a bit more info about the drive 
and (purported) campout/bbq that precludes it. I hope you don't mind another 
participant!

Thanks, ~Rich
