Wasn't the only change is that MOST 67s had 4.12 r and p s, instead of
the 4.37 r and p previously used ? This is of course not factoring rgb
ratios small nut/big nut and or mountain gearing into the equation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lucky for you, you've got a '67. That was a good year
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for trannys, with a &quot;taller&quot; 4th gear. I'm not sure if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they introduced it in '66 or '67,
