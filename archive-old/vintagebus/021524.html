&lt;&lt; My bus originally didn't come w/ an interior rearview mirror, but, I'm 
adding one for safety (mirror is from a '63). We have to drill the holes and 
I'm wondering what size screw is used in these holes? what type?&gt;&gt;
N 11 466 3  Tapping screw, countersunk raised head B 3.9X13.  Are you sure 
you really need an interior mirror?  We find that having the two outer 
mirrors are far more usefull!  All an interior mirror only shows center 
behind the bus and quite a bit off the ground.

 -What size screw is used for the drivers visor? Also, any tips on unsticking 
the visor (a bit of rust) moving mechanism on a pressboard visor?&gt;&gt;
N 11 466 3  Tapping screw, countersunk raised head B 3.9X13.  There are two 
pivots on all bus visors so we are not sure which one you are referring to.  
Either one you need to loosen with penetrating oil.  The pivot where the rod 
and pressboard visor meet is clamped on by a screw that tightens the pivot 
area like a water hose clamp.  Just loosen the screw until the visor moves 
and lubricate with heavier wieght oil than penetration oil.  Then tighten the 
adjusting screw until the visor stays up even on rough roads, but still loose 
enough to be lowered/raised by only two fingers not both hands!  This 
adjustment may have to be redone several times over the first couple of weeks 
with the pivot surfaces polishing themselfs out.

&lt;&lt;-Where do you bench seat guys mount your seat belts (i need to mount two I 
got from WW up front?&gt;&gt;
Take a look at later buses preferably a later 1967 with shoulder/lap belts 
postions,and duplicate on yours.

&lt;&lt;-What size screw is used to mount the cab divider? (is it the same as the 
interior panels?)does anyone have those 2 little corner rubber pieces? Are 
they neccessary?&gt;&gt;
Could not find a part number for those screws.  Best to ask to look or borrow 
a screw from a fellow panel owner.  The rubber pieces are not absolutely 
neccessary, but they do help retain heat up front and block interior noise 
from the cargo interior noise from the drivers seat.  They are just made from 
heavy density foam rubber.

&lt;&lt;-The is the grey color on the cab divider the same that I should paint the 
interior? Should I get a match off of this? &gt;&gt;
That should work!
