That tool also comes in most computer tool kits.  I have a couple of them.
The work great for getting small screws out of tight places also.

&gt; A couple of people expressed interest in the carb jet holding tool I
&gt; got today. It is like a slim pen with a plunger on one end. Depress
&gt; the plunger and four little hooks extend from the other end. Place the
&gt; jet in between them, release the plunger, and the four hooks retract
&gt; to hold the jet pretty securely. I've done the same procedure
&gt; successfully with tweezers, but they never held the jet squarely and
&gt; securely like this gizmo does. It was in a bin at P&amp;M Tools,
&gt; Sacramento CA, $3. They didn't have what I went there for, a little
&gt; elbow clamp thingy for my new dial gauge. Got a bunch of other junk
&gt; though...
