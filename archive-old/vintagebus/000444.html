&lt;&lt; I was wondering who or where is the best place to get vintage seat belts
 for my 67 deluxe. &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
We think that we got some of ours from Wolfsburg West.  They look just like 
stock including the sticker.  The only complaint we had was that the 
Wolfsburg sticker emblem rubbed off easly.  A little clear packing tape over 
this solved the problem for us.   Eric&amp;Barb
