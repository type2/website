&gt; Is there an easy way to do this cause I was under the bus and theres no way

Hi Rick,
First you may need to remove the nuts and run a die to clean up the threads.  
Eric's sister's bus was a major pain to adjust the clutch.  When we ran a die 
over the threads they were cut deeper.  In other words the factory die was 
shot when her cable was produced.  Next grease the threads and clamp on a 
vise-grip onto the swedged on solid end of the cable.  Not on the wire cable 
or on the treads!  Then try treading and adjusting the nuts.  All you will 
need is one hand to do this adjustment.  Finally you can replace the nuts 
with a wing nut from a later VW if your cable end is large enough and after 
filing off the locking nubs of the wing nut that are designed to lock in the 
diamond shaped hole in the later clutch arm.  Do not install a straight arm 
without replacing the left tranny side plate the rear end of the boden tube 
goes through or the result is rubbing/cutting through the tip of the boden 
tube sideways and most often this results also in 6,000 mile lifespan clutch 
cables.
