Subject: re:cleaning glass
Mime-Version: 1.0

how to clean really grimy glass....bob hoover recommended something like bon
ami-one of those powder cleansers like ajax or comet, but ithink he said you
had to use bon amu as the otheres were too abrasive...

or you could try a fine type of 3m scotch brite pad, those green thingy's,
they should not scratch the glass

with any of these i would try a small section first, then dry to see if you
scratche dit, it is hard to see scratches on wet glass
