Bus content:  I have in my possession a neat VW sales aid from the 
mid-60s, &quot;Comparing the Competition with Volkswagen Trucks&quot; (marked 
'CONFIDENTIAL&quot;!!).  It gives salesmen point-by-point instructions on how 
to favorably compare VW commercials to various models of Corvair/Corvan 
and Ford Econoline commercials.  Sadly, they don't seem to think the 
homely Dodge A-100 van series was worthy of mention...

&gt; A friend of mine picked up a double door Corvair Greenbriar Van. I think 
&gt; this model is called an 8-door Deluxe. It's a '61.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there know anything about these things? Send me some pmail 
&gt; about links, info, whatever.
