&lt;&lt; Can I reuse the old push rods?  They are straight and look fine.&gt;&gt;
Yes as long as you roll them across a flat surface (Table, countertop.) to 
make sure they are not bent at all.  Then you have to make sure they are the 
proper length to get the proper rocker/valve stem geometery or risk early 
valve guide failure.
 
  &lt;&lt;Do I use sealant on the oil cooler seals?&gt;&gt;
No!
 
  &lt;&lt;Do I need to use the gaskets that originally came under barrels?  I was
 told by the VW flaps to just use RTV.&gt;&gt;
You can do that.  We prefer to install the paper gasket with RTV finger 
painted on them.
 
 &lt;&lt;Do I need to use sealer on the cylinder head nuts that are in the valve 
gallery? &gt;&gt;
We have not done this and have had no leaks.     Eric&amp;Barb
