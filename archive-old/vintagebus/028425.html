how's everyone doing today? ;)

A Bear and  Rabbit were parked side by side in the campground, tuning up their
splitties... incidentally they had learned also side-by-side the technique of vw
engine rebuilding, but they had still not learned a few tricks and so were each
possessing of greasy dirty nasty vw engines. The Bear, though he was much bigger
(and generally slower) than the Rabbit, was able to finish his tuneup a little
faster because he had been listening to a few self-help audio tapes and could
focus on the task at hand moreso than the Rabbit.
    He looked down at his big greasy bear paws and grimaced... &quot;Rabbit,&quot; he asked,
&quot;do you have a problem with grease sticking to your fur?&quot;
    Rabbit answered: &quot;Well... no, not really...&quot;
    So the Bear picked the Rabbit up and wiped all the grease from his paws onto
the Rabbit....

ahem...

getting booted off the List is at Thom's discretion... last one, IIRC, was a
spammer.

let me simply suggest that *anyone* having muchas problemas with an OT post take
it up with:

A.) Your chaplain.
B.) Thom Fitzpatrick. If Thom Fitzpatrick *is* your chaplain... well, there you
go... ;)
C.) someone other than all 800 (?) Vintagebus listees at once. I think most people
will just delete original OT stuff... but even worse are the people that have to
post with blithering cries of &quot;OT! OT!... etc.&quot;... if you must respond to an OT
post or even a response to an OT post... at *least* make your hypocrisy amusing,
okay? open with a joke or anecdote or something...
D.) final option... take an interest in the &quot;delete&quot; button. it worketh wonders.
even delete this if it makes you feel better... ;) ...repeat as necessary with
ebay posts or whatever else gets your goat...

Logically, my post is twice-cooked hypocrisy. I realize that. Have a nice day.
