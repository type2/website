List:

I just got a call from a good friend of mine, Dave Kroesen, and he
informed me that he has put his '61 Flip Seat Westfalia up for sale. 
I've only seen the bus once, and that was at 4:30 in the morning before
we left his place for the Summer OCTO meet last June, and what I saw
looked like a great project camper.

From what I know it is a very complete camper with tent.  The most
important thing is that Dave is one of the most straight forward and
honest people I know.  He has been very active in the SoCal VW scene for
quite some time.  Everyone that knows Dave would echo my words.  He has
put the camper up on eBay, here's the link:

91&amp;r=0&amp;t=0

Not sure if I'm breaking the new *eBay rules* on the list, but this
camper needs to go to a good home, so I thought folks on the list would
appreciate knowing about it.  The camper is located in the Los Angeles
area.

Robert
