Man Thom does that bring back memories.
I used to drive a BIG dodge truck in HS and one day before taking a date to 
a Pink Floyd concert, I tiled the roof of the cab with shag carpet squares 
just like your friends bus.  Was quite horrified to find all the squares 
having fallen onto the seat when we came out later that night.  What a MESS.
