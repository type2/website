Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Spring Plates, 4 lug brakes, and early front suspension questions

when I undid the lowering job on my 59 I used 67 spring plates and tranny
from a wreck, so it should work fine. I neede a front tranny mount adapter
but I think the split case tranny went away in 59, so you shouldnt have to
bother with that. If it uses late model type 3 drums(think thats what they
use for the type 1 kits) you can use the early 5 lug type 3 drums if you can
find them.
    I also put the 67 front end in the 59 and it was straight forward, bolts
right in. freakin heavy and hard to manuver though, get friend or two to
help.

Subject: [VB] 67 Spring Plates, 4 lug brakes, and early front suspension
questions


&gt; I found a 1967 bus that some guy had that was cut into a dune buggy of
sorts
&gt; (Hey it wasn't me!).  Well, my question is, it has a complete IRS kit for
&gt; the rear suspension.  Are the spring plates the same on the '67 as my '60?
&gt; Because I already bought the kit, I just got to go unbolt it. There is
&gt; another problem I noticed, the drums are 4 lug.  What can I do to convert
&gt; these to 5 lug (without wheel adapters)?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have a complete '64 front suspension and would like to put it in
my
&gt; '60.  How hard is this, and what do I need to look out for?  I have all of
&gt; the brakes, and new drums for this later beam, and would really like it if
I
&gt; didn't have to go out and pay $140 for new pre '64 front wheel cylinders.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Charles
