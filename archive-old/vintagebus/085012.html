&gt;&gt;  Maybe mine is missing parts. Mine doesn't seem to have the throttle 
return  spring as this one does. My throttle return spring is hooked to a tall 
bracket  that bolts down to one of the fuel pump bolts. It has a couple of bends 
in it  and the spring is horizontal coming straight back toward the engine  
compartment lid. &lt;&lt;
