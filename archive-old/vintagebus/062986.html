Subject: RE: [VB] dim headlights/voltage ?'s now bus won't start

I did not have much time to work on the bus tonight-but I did get it to
start- I think the problem was in the relay connections. I took the relay
apart, and polished((with my dremel) any connection I could get to, and the
ones I had difficulty getting to-I scraped clean with a dental pick...hooked
it back up and the bus started.


I have just looked in the bentley guide pg E-10 1. I guess I have the
connector that is not in the photo-as my bus was built prior to august 1
1965. I think it was built on march 29. My connector was improved upon.

As for the spring loaded connector-I mean the plastic thing right on the
back on the sealed beam. It is black and triangular shaped. They are
basically three push on sockets in a plastic housing-but where the wires
from the loom connect it is a spring loaded connection. I don't have a
digital camera handy-but I will try to describe it...basically there is a
piece of copper bent over in a u-shape. The tinned wire goes under this
u-shape piece. I think it is tinned-or soldered someway or other so all the
strands are stuck together. Now the bent piece of copper feeds through a
slot in the plastic and a small spring holds it in the plastic housing. It
is quite a complicated little piece. Now the problem in the design-there is
nothing holding the wire tight to the copper connector-just the spring. I
think there is too much slop in there. In other words I can actually see
space between the connector and the wire.I think tomorrow night I will try
circumventing the connector and just use some aligator clips between the
headlight and the wires of the bus...if this works ~ the problem is in the
plastic connector,right? therefore I will go out and get some new
connectors.(I guess to answer your question-yes it is possible to remove the
wires fromthe push on connector-no problem, actually very easy)

A side note about the wiring diagrams....one thing that has confused me
about the diagrams-My bus has a regulator which is not attached to the
generator-als post august '65 usa version wiring diagram. which does not
match when my bus was made?

anyone else have this situation?

Thanks again for your help....hoepfully this will be straightened out this
week, as I am hoping to pull the engine this weekend to retorque the
heads...check all the seals-oil cooler, new exhaust gaskets....and whatever
other damage I can cause in one weekend by myself...
