&gt; Hi Volks- some family BS came up and I missed EveryBus. I want to live
&gt; vicariously thru the list, so would someone post a trip report with pictures
&gt; so that I can have my &quot;EB&quot; fix. PLEASE............. Ted

Hey Tedebare   We really missed ya and those other OVT guys  Frank, John  
where were you guys   Eb without Franks Chilli  man I am still jonesing  it wasnt 
quite the same without you guys .  I had a candian invasion a coupe of days 
before , Gord Potts stopped in with his new to him 85 westy that needed some 
work, Steve dolan, and jamie rivers stopped in  jamie had Steves motor that 
neede to be installed in his 67 westy and Jamie was bringing it down from where it 
went to Canada last Eb ,  I had called jamie and talked him into bringing it 
to my shop, they were going to do it there at EB but it was a good thing as we 
had to asseble a lot of it and there were a bunch of nuts, bolts ,gaskets etc 
missing so being at the shop we had everything we needed to do the job  would 
have been a PITA at EB  after getting the motor in and running the oil pump 
was dumping oil turns out that one of the studs was stripped , so I tried to 
remove the oil pump but it just kept on breaking the tool so I went to the parts 
shelf and had both kinds of pumps so I just busted the old one out and 
replaced it with a new pump after fixing the stripped stud.  Steve and Marcus lefyt 
at about 7 on Thur  Jamie had left earlier.  Fri we finished Gords van and 
left at noon, there was myself with Sandra, Gord, norton, wild bill and another 
canadian Denny. Made it down with the only problem being Wild bill having a 
front tire go flat which he didnt even know till Norton saw it  Dennys auto 
tranny was leaking so we had him at the rear to keep from covering all the other 
buses.  Got to Eb and set up camp ,mixed a drink and started to talk to 
everybody and party.  Got to meeet Rod Laffon  hit it off great seemed like birds of 
the same feathers if you know what I mean. LOL   Stayed up real late going from 
fire to fire , woke the next morning  feeling like I had been ran over but 
still in good sprits . Only problem was my old dog got out of the tent at 5 in 
the morn and wandered off which amazed us cause her rear legs dont work very 
well . Me. Sandra little Mike, and Waldo looked all over the camp for her and 
Mike found her laying down all the way down at the lower bathhouse  She has 
walked since so it looks like time to have her put down but she is 15 years so she 
has had a good long life and has been a great dog.  She is my last dog and it 
will be strange being dogless after having at least one and as many as 5 
since 1968 . The trip home was a nice enjoyable ride no problems . Penn. Tom 
joined us riding back and dug thur the box of brake reserviors for one for his bus 
. He left for home , bill crashed for 2 days LOL  norton got back only to find 
a water leak had flooded his basement , Help Denny check his tranny and it 
was too far gone as it was leaking and the auto fluid was mixing with his diff. 
grease. Gord stayed one day extra and we finished his van .He left to catch 
the others at Jamie Auchs must have made it as I havent heard anything else.  
The funniest thing was after the awards I was standing with MUD and he finds 
this cell phone on the ground, we were checking the numbers to see if it was 
anybodies that we knew and the 3rd number down was my shops number. I went who 
would have my number on their cell, so MUD calls the last number dialed and this 
lady comes on the other end and MUD askes if she knows anybody that was at EB  
Turns out it was Gords Lady friens and it was his phone . LOL   I probably 
left out something  oh yea  I,m the Baccie ball champ !!!   Later and have fun
