The registration flyer for the upcoming American Rental Association
convention in Anaheim features a red/white 23 window.  I'm seeing a lot of
split screens in the media lately - have we, finally, acheived the coolness
we've sought all these years?

I finally saw the new Honda commercial featuring the
new Honda alternative electric/diesel and a white over
red bus at a cross roads.
A photographer was taking shots of all kinds of buses
at the June OCTO show. He mentioned at that time that
he was scouting for this commercial. He took tons of
shots of the '54 Barnambulator.
Also spotted an ad in last weekend's Phoenix local
newspaper looking for &quot;pre-66&quot; vehicles for an
upcoming movie. (Street scene) Payment was $100.00 per
day and vehicles need to be left on site for several
days...
