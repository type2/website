&gt;Why not mount a webcam on or in the bus so that at anytime, you could
&gt;connect to a website and view our big 2 week roadtrip to Cali.  I discussed
&gt;this with Kirin and the only way to have it full time is via a remote
&gt;satellite or cell link which would cost lotsa bucks.

I looked into this earlier this year when it looked like I was
going to need to dial in (modem) to work from a remote spot in
Texas.  You need a cell phone with the capability and a modem
card for the laptop that matches the cell phone (the modem you
already have probably won't work).  You can buy the phone and
the card as a package for $300 or so.  Then there's airtime.
Also, you only get around 2400 - 9600 bits/sec on the cell
phone modem, so your pictures are going to take awhile to
upload.

If you drop your real-time requirement it gets much cheaper
and more doable.  Pictures can be uploaded if you stop in
towns big enough to have public 'Net access, like at the
library, an Internet cafe', office supply store, etc.  Or,
modem them back via payphone...still requires some equipment
but the phone rates can be cheaper than cell if you do it
right.  If nothing else, set out with a box of floppies and
a stack of FedEx mailers - mail a disk home each night to
a support person who will put it up on the Web.

&gt;So Kirin mentioned why not try to get some big oil mogul or
&gt;gas station chain to sponsor us.  

VWoA?  MTV (a la' their road trip show?)  One of the auto
mags?  Maybe one of the VW parts houses?  You might ask around
at some local &quot;entry level&quot; racing events, like SCCA and
autocrosses and such...these folks might have some contacts
and ideas with local suppliers/sponsors.

&gt;It's a far flung idea but it might be neat to have a full 
&gt;time camera on so people could follow our whole 2 week saga.

I don't like to be the pessimist, but it also lets the whole
world know about where your Bus is at all times, in case they
need some parts or want to take their own ride in your Bus...

Just some thoughts.
