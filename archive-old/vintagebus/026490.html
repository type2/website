Subject: [VB] non-split axle boot install. + METAL plugs
Message-ID: &lt;38549F25.75FC31F9_at_HIWAAY_dot_net&gt;

After staring at it for a few weeks I today tried to do the seemingly
impossible:

install non-split axle boots on a 65 - 67 axle

impossible it seemed as on these models the rubber stopper mount and the
brake hose bracket are welded onto the axle tube, making it seemingly
impossible to pull the boot over them.

After heating the axle tube and the boot and applying lots of soap the
boots went on amazingly easy. One has to stretch and let slide without
overstretching.

BTW: when pressing the reduction gear housings off the tubes be prepared
for a major &quot;CLONK&quot;.
They are on tight (not as tought as the front king pins though).

The transmission inside seems fine, only one of the big shoulder
bearings needs replacing. I'll do both since I am this far.

The reduction gear housings can be reinstalled with NEW metal plugs
which I got for $5 at my local VW FLAPS  :)  guess I got lucky
All reduction gear bearings will be new FAG/SKF. It was actually cheaper
getting them from Germany then buying them here. Here I was offered only
no name manufacturers for the lower outer one (the expensive one).

I wonder what this bus will drive like with an all new or like new drive
train.

Not liking split axle boots,

Martin Peitz
