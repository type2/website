Good question, I think they were drilled when the plates were installed.  My
'55 has been drilled twice, once for the larger '55 CA yellow plates
(original CA-sold Bus) and once for the smaller later plates.

I've seen others with 1 set of holes, to fit German plates. And other with
many holes, bullet and otherwise...

&gt; No holes for the rear lin. plate (hanging in rear window) how does it
mount
&gt;or are the holes not visable in pictures? Did factory b/ds not come with
&gt;rear holes so you could mount were you wanted?
