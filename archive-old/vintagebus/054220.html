got there

You only just now found that &lt;Ronnie's discoveries&gt; out because you live =
in AZ
and have no need for heat...

Ellis writ:
HEAT!? did someone say HEAT? Gee-whiz, we been havin' heat since March and =
it's
Damned near Mid November and it's STILL in the mid to higher 90's in =
Phoenix.
Havasu and Bullhead have generally been hotter than us stuck in &quot;LA in the
microwave&quot;. Anyone who says that summer in Phoenix is only June, July and
August is on crack. I count March, April, May, June, July, August, =
September,
October and half of November. Sometimes January is warm, February can be =
rainy
and early March is windy.

I can't wait for late December and the later part of January when the =
rains
come. First part of January is usually excellent for Volleyball and =
watching
bikinis in Phoenix and fishing for Bass and metal leader for Pike, P*t, =
Pabst
and Poo*tang at Stoneman Lake. Later January is warm and sunny in Havasu =
for
regurgitating by the Bridge and discussing whatever happened to the bus =
market.

February is only rainy on the 14th when the Az Volkswagen Club used to =
hold car
shows. March is the start of Summer again.

Winter? Oh, that's usually about December 21-23.

Heat, oh yeah, crank up the gas heaters, electic-bumwoolens and eggnog.
