Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

I'm on my second bus with a gas heater installed. I'm sold.
I will NEVER drive a bus in winter without one again, that's for sure. We
had 24 days in January where we didn't bet above freezing. It was awesome to
be able to drive around with just a T-shirt on.

&gt; No never had or used a gas heater. Sounds good on a cold winter day.
