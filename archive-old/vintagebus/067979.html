Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question: Bentley typeface? 

I give up~! I was digging through my closets looking for my old professional
type specing books... in vain. The only book that I came up with was a dated
&lt;1980&gt; ITC Collection Headliner fonts, not the body copy ref manual that I
needed. It looks like I am old school and thanks to Matt R the mystery is
mostly solved.

Keep in mind that to some degree, each font collection has their own name
affixed to the particular &quot;cut&quot; of the font. ITC, the International Type
Corporation charged/charges a fee on usage of their licensed font faces. That
is why there were millions of variations of Helvetica, each with a different
name to a very minor variation.

Also, you might contact Robert Bentley, Inc. | Automotive Publishers

As of a few years ago, a nice guy, Stan C. Wohlfarth was the Associate Editor,
