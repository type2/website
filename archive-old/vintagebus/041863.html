&gt; In all reality if my memory serves me right it was #!$% MAD MAN MUNTZ. I'm
&gt; almost positive he was the pioneer of the four track decks, I remember going
&gt; to his store over 31 years ago to pick up my new 4 track deck after I kept
&gt; scratching the 45 records on my under dash record player, I think his
&gt; downfall was the big screen TV, this MAD MAN was way ahead of the times. I'm
&gt; not a good web search guy but MUNTZ logo was as memorable as Felix the Kat
&gt; or was that Fritz the Cat, oh my poor memory!

Your memory is pretty good!  From:

...Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz was one of the most interesting
practitioners of the art of hucksterism that America has ever known. He
was a self-taught
 engineer, an outrageous personality, and the inventor of the Muntz
Stereo-Pak 4-track system, the direct ancestor of our beloved 8-track.
Muntz was a high school
 dropout and a tinkerer. Like Bill Lear, the father of 8-track, Muntz's
tinkering led to some great machines. Lear had his Lear Jet and Muntz
created the Muntz Jet, a
 souped-up sportscar which sold for $5,500 (big, big bucks in the early
1950's). Like Lear, Muntz was an audio nut. According to Billboard, he
developed the first known car stereo - a 110-volt system that was modified
to run on the car's own battery to avoid the risk of electrocution.
