Eric and Barb love this kit. Like most things, it probably depends on
how much care you put into the job.
I have seen steering wheels done with bondo and spray paint and they
look pretty good. (Thom)

Also, there is a very nice leather cover you can get for a bus steering
wheel from WCM, wheelskins brand, like on porsches. I have one, about
$30 retail I think, and it will cover a wheel very nicely until the koch
restoration is within reach.
