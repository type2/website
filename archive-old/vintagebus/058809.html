Subject: [VB] So-Cal to Corona de Tucson


Hey guys,

The family and I are heading to Corona de Tucson this weekend.  We are
planning to leave late Friday night, since I have to work.

Anyone from So-Cal heading out that ways and want to caravan?  We live in
Temecula and are planning to take the I-10.

Later,
Beto
