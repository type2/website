Subject: Re: [VB] Turn signal switch

Take the turn signal switch off the steering column, and put a small piece
of rubber between it and the column.  Then put the switch back on and
tighten.  It shouldn't go anywhere after that.  Good luck.

&gt; I have 67 bus and my turn signal switch is loose. I have tightened the
&gt; screws as tight as they will go but there is still considerable play. Any
&gt; suggestions on how to get the switch tight without stripping the screws
and
&gt; holes? Any tricks you experienced guys and gals may have would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.
