&lt;&lt; My sideplates have begun to drip.  Let me know if this is the procedure.  I
 figure I'll unbolt the sideplate, wipe everything down, change the gasket, 
reapply
 sealant and bolt it back up.  Question is, what kind of &quot;glue&quot; should I use?
  Someone said 3M but 3M what? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
More often than not having the side plates leak means that all they need is 
to be retorqued to thier proper specs.  Use a torque wrench on the ones you 
can get to with it in the VW and then estimate with your hand pressure and a 
open wrench on the last few.  To reseal them with sealant would mean removing 
the entire tranny and taking off the axles to get in there enough to properly 
clean, measure for proper gasket thickness, and reseal with sealant.
