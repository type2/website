Subject: Re: [VB] Early Westy Curtain Rod Question
To: Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;
Cc: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Thom I see, 3 individual from all my brochures.  Only
seen a handful of westys in your year range and all
had 3 seperate.  Your bus is pretty early and those
first westy years were pretty much hand made, one-off
campers so maybe a strange 1 piece unit.  But from my
`55-`56 `57 brochures I see 3 seperate rods.

Hope this helps...somewhat :-)

&gt; On the early westfalias, ie the range that my 55
&gt; would fall into, was the
&gt; driver's side curtain rod a single piece, or 3
&gt; individual pieces?  I have a
&gt; '59 brochure, and it looks like it's one piece, but
&gt; it's hard to tell.
