&gt;    I have been asked many times and never had the answer to what went
&gt;  around the steering column at the floor. I have never owned a bus with
&gt;  anything there and all the people and Geru's I asked never had a definate
&gt;  answer. Well I think I have solved it. On my new 15 window Deluxe as I was
&gt;  cleaning it I pulled out the floor mat to hose the cab out,lo and behold to
&gt;  my surprise there was a seal at the base of the steering column.

ps; there is also a rubber plug in the floor under the clutch pedal about
3/8 of an inch in diameter. I have been fining all kinds of interesting
oddities on this bus that I haven't seen on any of my other 3 60's buses.

ya they came with grommets and seals.  funny mysterious ones.  Peruse your 
parts list- there is all kinds of nifty information in there.   With pictures.
