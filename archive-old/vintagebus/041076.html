 Well, I bought by DC from a guy in the Kansas City area for $800.  It can be seen on VW Planet (www.thesamba_dot_com/vw) in the Double Cab section on page six.  What you don't see however, is that when I bought it, the poor fella didn't have a floor.  This has since been remidied with pieces of a bug floor pan, real estate signs (thanks nieghboors!), liquid nails and pop rivets.  Sorry, I'm a poor college kid, I would have welded if I could afford the right peices and knew how to weld.  He had a hit in the nose too.  I've been able to pop most of it back out and will have to putty a little to smooth it all out.  House paint job (with mop perhaps?.  This one you've found sounds about twice as nice as mine.  Except after a tune up and go through the engine ran like a dream.  In the mean time, I'd offer at least $1500.  That sounds fair to me at least.
