&gt;   I just got an interesting phone call from a company that builds airplanes
&gt; looking for RGB (big nut). It seems that for the last 30 plus years they
&gt; have been useing VW Big Nut RGB's in airplanes powered by Corvair engines.
&gt; The interesting part of this is that they turn these at 4500 RPM's at the
&gt; axle shaft, I'd like to figuare out what MPH that would work out to be. All
&gt; this talk of handgernading RGB's by turning to many rpm just went out the
&gt; window.

I think the RGB gear box has a 1.29 gear ratio
That works out to just a poky, 273 MPH using 205 70 15 tires

Yikes
