So which is it folks? This is a single port intake manifold from a 1964
1500, which is now being bolted to a new 1600 SP. 6mm studs... The Bentley
for 1961-1967 doesn't say, just says to tighten evenly by hand. The Wilson
book and apstockton_at_hotmail_dot_com say 14 ft. lbs.. VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com says
6 ft. lbs. like the sump nuts. 

I've tried 14 ft. lbs., and snapped one of the studs. So is it really 6
ft. lbs. and I'm one the way to ruining more studs if I torque to 14 ft.
lbs?
