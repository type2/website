&gt; From Everett's site, I got some really handy info on decoding the m-code
&gt;  plate, but have not been able to figure out what the color scheme 
originally
&gt;  was for my baby - a '59 micro. Here's what it says where there should be
&gt;  numbers: GRGRUEN
&gt;  Are those abbreviations for some colors in German?
&gt;  

that is where there should be the name of the colours written.  They changed 
the styles of m code plates a couple times, the later ones get colour codes.  
  your letters stand for Grey/ Green.   Germans spell green gru:n, umlaut 
also can be written by an e after the vowel, this gruen.

thinks VW called them  seagull grey,  mango green.  Caramel brown with white 
piping interior.
