Hi List,

Anyone adjusted the fit of the front doors on their bus? If so please share
your knowledge. My drivers side front  door has cracked up around the lower
hinge and as a result has developed a bunch of sag. I have seen doors in
junkyards that have had this area welded up and one that I saw yesterday fit
up really nicely. I am completely in the dark as to how I would get the
alignment right before laying into the welding. Fig suggested that I have
some reinforcement welded over the repair to spread the load over a wider
area - this sounds like a good idea.

Later

Michael
