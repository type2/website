you wrote
&gt; To solve everything, I thing thats what we all need- a monthly or
by-monthly
&gt; mag devoted to vintage type 2's and nothing else.It sure seems there would
&gt; be a market for it as there are a lot of folks that are into transporters.

i'd say yea!  ---  a world wide based type2 mag..  bought to you by.....
erm......   us! :)
all we need now is backing to go to print, a few contributors.
I'll volunteer as EU contingent.

hmm.. my first thought was to say i concider the list to be better than any
mag.. contact daily, friendly, informative, all those bus web sites to
browse...
but you gotta think about all the folk missing out on this.

regardless of terrible weather for the whole weekend - a show over here
Vanfest has been going from strength to strength..   who'd have thought at
first that the van based show could be bigger than the all types
counterparts.  maybe a glossy mag could go this way too.

good call

get at it
