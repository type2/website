&lt;&lt;  The tranny certainly can be from a 69 bug, just not the axles.
Any tranny with  dual side plates can accept bus reduction box

Nope, no way.  1969-1972 were dual side cover Type I IRS.   A
different animal from the earlier swingaxles.  Now, you can convert
a IRS back to a Swingaxle and then the '69-'72s will work. But
they won't work if they are still IRS.
