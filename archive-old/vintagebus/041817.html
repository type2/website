&gt; &lt;&lt; I don't know how it goes.
&gt;  It is sort of Tee shaped with the tail of the Tee inclined - should it slope
&gt;  up toward the roof or down towards the ground? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Jdd,
&gt; Downward is how VW did it. 
...
&gt; Then you have to notch it for the accelerator and choke cables.

On mine, the cable tube that passes through the fan shroud and the front
tin was long enough that it holds the seal out of the way without
notching.  The pressure of the seal also holds the throttle tube in place
and stops it from moving back and forth.
