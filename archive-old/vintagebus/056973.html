&gt; how many of you actually DRIVE your bus 
&gt; DAILY?!?!?!?

Jon,

You well know that the only time I drive anything but
a bus is to haul a bus/parts etc. w/ my 1955 Ch_at_vy and
flat-bed trailer.  Been hauling tons of rock for my
property w/ my doublecab and I don't think that I'd
trust an American or Japanese pickup to haul what I
put in that truck.  1.08 tons is the record so far,
but that was a little too much, and I lost my header
on that one.
