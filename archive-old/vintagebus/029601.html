OK, now Craig's prolly feelin' like a Fatcat Capitalist Piggie after
pokin' fun at certain kinds of people.  And that viewpoint's been told
off by Charlie, Poor Richard, and Ronnie in ways that I can't argue
with.

The folks Ronnie describes are wonderful people, though sometimes ya
gotta tell your left brain to shutthef*ckup long enough so you can hear
what they're saying.  OTOH there are irresponsibles in that (and any)
crowd who can give 'em a bad name.  Folks, be open and loving but
scrutinize the hell outta anyone who's coming inside your house.  OTOH,
be HIGHLY suspicious whenever any group that rejects Modrin Material
Culcha is being satirized or lampooned.  Plays right into the hands of
The Man, who most certainly exists, thank you.

But what fascinates me is how this Filthy Hippies / Sweet Flower
Children dichotomy still resonates after 30+ years, and what a
singularly appropriate forum in which to have it happen.

And danged if it didn't push me off the vintage resto / hippie bus
fence.  Where's that house paint?
