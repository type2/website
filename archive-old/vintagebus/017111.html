HVLP's are cool!  I don't know about this brand - I have a DeVilbiss, but
I'm sold.  Does yours have the capability to use a ziplok back for the 
paint?  Mine does, which lets me paint in any position!  Even upside down!
I don't know about the quality of your gun.  I paid $189 for mine at HF.
Devilbiss is a lower-end &quot;name brand&quot; - you might consider upgrading for
the $30.

JUNK!  Take it BACK!  You can get a real compressor - cast iron, two cylinder,
oiled, 60 gallon, upright, for less than $400 _at_ harbor freight.

&gt;     *A bunch of other stuff like blower nozzle,tack rags,water filters, and
&gt; a partridge in a pear tree!

What kind of water filter?  I hope it's not the cheezy little inline ones.
Another hint is to buy and extra short hose, say 20', and coil it in a bucket 
of cold water ahead of the water trap.

&gt; I'll be building a spray booth out of 2x4's and plastic sheeting.  I plan to
&gt; use two fans to aerate the booth...both intake and output to have filters.

You need LOTS of air.  Go with 2 more fans if you can swing it.

&gt; I wonder...should I try to create remote motor systems for the fans to keep
&gt; from getting blown up by potential sparks from the motors?

You should be OK - just don't try to spray into the fans!
 
&gt; As far as compressor size goes, I think that I can make this one work....I

It's simple: your gun documentation will have a rating for what it needs;
ie X cfm _at_ Y psi.  Compare that to the compressor, keeping in mind that
you will have pressure losses in the hose.

&gt; much air at once anyway...I can't tell until I get some paint in it and try
&gt; to get mixture/flow/pattern right.  I figure that I should paint only one
&gt; section at a time anyway...roof-front-leftside-back-rightside.  These are

Get some scrap to test on.

&gt; Also:  Does anyone have a good technique for removing glass without breaking
&gt; it?  I cut out all the old seals, except for the rear hatch.  The seal is
&gt; actually in great shape, and it would be a shame to waste $20....unless I
&gt; broke the glass trying to get it out!

Trying to save the seal is false economy.  Buck up and buy a new seal!

Do you have a real regulator on this compressor?  If not, get one.  The
HVLP is a little more sensitive than conventional guns to line pressure
changes.  Also get one of the baby regulators to mount *on* the gun.  That's
right - two regulators.

Also get a good respirator.  The next time I paint, I plan to get one
with an integrated mask.  The paint I was using really bothered my eyes.
And the fumes - I can still remember the hurt from going into the garage
a few hours after shooting, and still feeling a burn in my chest!
