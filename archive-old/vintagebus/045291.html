Me and my buddy Forrest towed the ol' beast home Sunday afternoon with his
little Toyota pick-up.  To say the least it was very exciting!  When we
showed up at the farm where it had been sitting for the past 18 years or
so, the lady who lived there already had the tires pumped up and was.....

Like I said, we were using my buddy's little Toyota truck with a nylon tow
strap and I had never towed like this before.  The only brakes on the bus
was the e-brake, and it didn't work all that great.  A couple scary
corners and we decided to pull over.  I tighened the e-brake cables and we
were on our way down Hwy 95.  We cooked down 95, getting up to 60 mph at
some points!

I am glad you survived.   This sounds very unsafe towing at 60 wth only an
ebrake.   Better to have taken the back roads and stayed to 25mph.   Or fix
hitch towed the bus.

 I just have one question.  As some of you might know, this '65 is
a walk-through.  I want to get the m-codes copied down from behind the
front seat, but with the chance of sounding like an idiot, I have to ask
how the heck do you get to the back of the passenger seat?  I tried
folding it forward or taking it out, but no dice!  Sorry about sounding
like such an idiot, but I'm new to the whole running bus thing!  Thanks!

pull the LOWER part of the backrest part of the passenger seat forward.  The
top of the backrest is hooked into the bulkhead, and won't pull forward.
