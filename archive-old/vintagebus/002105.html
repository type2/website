&gt; Hi all, I have a question about my 67 westy rear hatch. Does anybody know
&gt; what that slide latch is, on the inside right hand side of the rear hatch?

Rock,
I always assumed that the slide latch you speak of is to
secure the back hatch from the inside, particularly while
someone is in there sleeping. In case the hatch isn't locked
with a key from the outside, all you have to do is secure that
slide latch and you're safe without having to go outside.
that's what I've always used mine for.
My bus is still iced in, I plan on getting  out my oxy-acetylene
setup this morning to thaw her out. It's kind of like that crew
on the Discovery Channel who found that WW II bomber under
the ice and brought her back to the surface.
