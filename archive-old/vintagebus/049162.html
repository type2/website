Thanks Greg and Clara for supporting my need.  I can remember when Greg (frankiehil) was looking furiously for Sigla glass, albeit Sigla AS-1 only glass.  As I recall he took a bit of a bashing from several folks on the list for no reason other than that they couldn't understand why that was important to Greg.

The main concern, Les, is that original glass is metric and a different thickness than U.S spec glass.  Maybe if you took a class from one of the vintage *VW Nazi's* you might know this.  Since I prefer to use original glass, and parts, on the restoration of my bus, I strive to have matching logos, especially on two windows that sit right next to each other.

I understand Les' curiousity with certain people, like myself, searching the ends of the Earth for *correct* original parts.  What I don't understand is why people like Les get bothered by it.  What difference does it make to you Les, or anyone else, what I want for my bus.  If you don't have what I need, or have it and don't want to sell it to me, then ignore my post and move on.  What I, and other people, don't need are pointless remarks about why and what we choose to do with our buses and how that doesn't agree with your philosophy.  I might not like your bus and the way that you've chosen to keep it on the road, but why would I tell you that?  I don't care and you don't care, it's YOUR bus.

Granted, if I were asking for your opinion then ramble on.  But I'm not asking for your opinion, I'm asking for glass.  I realize that folks on the list consider this an open forum to comment as how we each see fit.  But it is also a way to trade information and parts in order to help each other with the same common thread that we hold between us, love for pre '68 Volkswagen buses. 

For whatever reason this one hit my nerves this time.  Maybe too much coffee this morning.  Maybe I just get tired of the senseless comments that pop up every now and then.  Maybe it's because I finally have my bus back after 14 months in the shop and I need help, not mindless dribble.

Thanks to all in advance for any help wasting my time looking for a Sigla windshield.  I guess I should find better things to do with my time.

Robert
