are you serious? they have been my ONLY means of transportation for many,
many years.  not only have they been daily drivers, but long haul
workhorses.  and most have been westfalias, too. of course most of them
i've bought not running and have gone through everything mechanical and
have performed regular maintenance.  i drive a split because i don't like
plastic and i really like the styling, reliability, and capabilities of the
vehicles.  i had a 71 for a while, and i couldn't wait to get rid of it and
buy another splitty.  granted, splits are not for everyone.  i also don't
like the feel of the ride of bay busses--too bouncy and too spongy feeling.
just my humble opinion, and kept polite for family viewing!

&gt; Is a split window bus a reliable daily driver...say between about 1963 -
&gt; 1967? I have a chance to buy a 1981 deluxe camper ($2000) that needs a
&gt; tranny ($1500 new w/clutch if needed), and I like it but what I really
want
&gt; is a split window camper. However, I live in Wisconsin and would I be
&gt; happier with the later model bus in the long run (it has a working gas
&gt; heater)? I hope this email does not annoy the other listees and is an
&gt; appropriate post. I guess I want to hear the selling points of the split
&gt; window vs. anything later and why you drive a split. Finally, would it
make
&gt; the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
&gt; split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).
