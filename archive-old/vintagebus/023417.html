Harry:  You mentioned you had your DC soda blasted last fall.  Do you mind
telling how much this costs?  What about paint, what did you pay?

I am seeing advice on where to get body work and blasting / painting done
for my 1963 Double Cab.  The body is in good shape, but there are projects
that I know I need professionals to do:

  1:  Front nose needs to be replaced, it has been dented in at the emblem
area (a tire was mounted?) and is bondo -- cracking.
  2:  All new wiring harness.  I even have one out of a 1960 that is in
decent shape.  I figure the best time to do this is when the front nose is
off.
  3: A professional replacement of battery tray.  It is functional, but a PO
put in a less than proper repair.
  4: Engine lid hinge is broken, needs replaced.
  5: There is a minor dent in the back of one rear wheel well, likely an
easy pound out.
  6:  P.O. put a silver-dollar size hole in the cab roof!  On in both the
inside and outside -- I believe some form of antenna was mounted.

And then ultimately the final work and other misc projects:

  7:  Complete sandblasting (Soda Blasting recommended) and painting.  The
whole vehicle needs it, but the gates and other parts could be done as
individual pieces.  I'm going with the stock all Ivory paint.
  8:  Replace gas tank.  I would like upgrade to something larger, but at
minimum it is leaking fumes and needs to be restored.  Although someone on
the list has suggested that there is a lot of unused room for gas tanks in a
double cab, perhaps a 17GAL tank or something would be nice :)

The problem in Seattle area is two fold -- there are lots of choices, but
not many I have found actual customers who have used.  Going rates are high
given the demand...

I have the smaller projects such as the engine lid and battery tray that I'd
like to start with to familiarize myself with the work of the shop / person.

I'm looking for affordable know-what-doing professionals or a high-end
hobbyist.  Or just advice!

I have photos of the truck at http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/63crew/
