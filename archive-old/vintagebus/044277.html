 I have a 66 os-42 that I got for cheap because of a
 bad transaxle. After disassembling the reduction boxes
 I have found that one of the inner bearings of the
 driven gear shaft is bad.  The question is what are
 the chances of the soft plug behind the bearing
 getting buggered up when I press the thing out.  If
 said plug does get buggered, are they easily found or
 will it be easer to just get a good reduction
 gear/tunnel assembly.
  &gt;&gt;

press out?   thats a no no.  You remove the plug (weld bolt or nut to it and 
PULL)
remove nut on inside of plug area
****remove circlip****

then you can tap or press the stub axle out, and remove and replace both 
inner reduction bearings.  

I think if you try to press the stub axle out w/o doing these steps you could 
bugger up your RGbox half.

 Check out your Bentley book for pictures.
