&gt; Are you still in California?  I was under the impression this was an arizona thing...

yes, i'm still in california... same town for the last 10 years, same general area for the last 18 years.

so this updated market value for buses (not other volkswagens?) only has effect in one state as far as registration?  all other states can use this information for insurance claims?  is this correct?
