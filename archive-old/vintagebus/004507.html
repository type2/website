&gt;what I would like to do is to drop it by about 2&quot; all around, but am
&gt;unsure as to the best method. I've seen it done on other busses and
it
&gt;looks really cool.


 Oh no!!! We're not in for another round of lowering flaming again are
we? Thom---PLEASE don't let it happen! =:-{  You should be able to
find a bunch of lowering advice in the archives? Good luck with your
bus. I personally agree with the &quot;do whatever you want, it's YOUR bus&quot;
philosophy. Just don't turn it into a 21-window! ;-)
