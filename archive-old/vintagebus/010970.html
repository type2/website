I was spending quality time leafing through the WCM catalog and
noticed replacement panels, though my wife would look more
approvingly (ok, less disapprovingly) on my '65 if I dressed it up
a bit -- the panel set is $950!! I was amazed! What makes it worth
that much money? Not that I'm going to be ordering it anytime
soon...

who knows?  that is a lot of cake.   But if you have time and some tools, you
can get some 1/8 hardboard (costs about $7.50 a 4 by 8 sheet here) and you
need a template and a jigsaw and cut yourself some.   measure snap holes and
drill.  wrap sandpaper around a block of wood to smoth the edges.  Makes sure
all will fit before decorating them.  The front door panels with snaps need to
be sanded down a bit on the door side around the edges or the snaps won't hold
as they are made for slightly thinner panel material.   Spray paint or cover
with your old material or some new material- whatever floats your boat.  I did
the cab panels for my 65 westy and they do look nice, if I do say so myself,
and cost about $10 including spray paint -  Grey, even though the texture is
not the same as the original.   Takes some time, but Improved things a lot.
Roof, kick, door panels.
   Made some seat covers out of a big piece of black corduroy I had laying
around- cut and sewed them - took a couple hours maybe, but then again my mom
is the costume lady for a theatre so I've known how to sew for ages.
Corduroy is good as it's sturdy, warmer in the winter than vinyl, and you
don't stick to it in the summer when you wear shorts.  I would have preferred
another colour than black, as that does show up stuff easier than a medium
colour, though. 
  Then polish and wax your dash, clean your dash knobs and grab handles,
polish the widgets such as the bits of switches you see, the rear view mirror,
the window latches.   I'd take the grab handle and sunvisors and inner door
handles off and wash them in a bucket of water with laundry soap- maybe even
let them soak with bleach.   Reassemble,

 and the cab will look so pretty.     :)
