Subject: Type 4 cooler overheat revisited
References: &lt;3960A3B9.2C30FBE5_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Thanks for the all of the information.  We have looked at a lot of it and
although we are not finding any one thing that is way off we are tweaking the
system.

First of all we did seal around the cooler and every hole we could find in
the tin. We did use a modified hoover bit (made it longer for the wider
cooler)
We have a large nut tranny but not a freeway flyer and we run 205R15's.
We have no idea on the C/R as the engine is by PO, back a couple.
We do have a tach, we run 3200 rpm at 55 mph
We have not worked on the jets but from the exhaust it is running rich if
anything.
Heater boxes are hooked up.

The generator/engine turn ratio is 1.6 :1.  We are looking at a smaller
pulley or a shorter belt to get the ratio closer to 2:1.

We reset the timing to 5 deg BTDC with Vac hose pulled, and now goes to 28
deg full advance at
1900 RPM with vacum line on.

Thanks
