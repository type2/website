&gt; I am trying to find a program for my Macintosh that will allow me to learn
&gt; to build sites on my own but that will take time.  Any suggestions would
be
&gt; great.

Charlie,
    I am not a mac man, but try these two. They interface with you as a word
processor and write the html in the background. Claris Homepage (nice,
simple) and Dreamweaver - (more serious).
