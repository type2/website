Subject: Re: [VB] Dual vs single vacuum advance

&gt; The owner, a great guy named Tim, didn't really know which was better, the single or dual advance. I
&gt; know the single advances the timing and the dual advances then retards the timing. My question is,
&gt; what are the advantages and/or disadvantages to using the dual advance.

I've been told the dual vacuum holds it back at idle, in effect giving
more advance off the line.  Then again some folks say just plug the retard
side or disconnect it.  I've used them and they worked fine.  The drawback
is that if you need to replace the vacuum can it costs about twice as much
as the single one as I recall.
