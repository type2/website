I have single port intakes with Delorto 36 carbs on my 69 hardtop westy with 
hex bar linkage, they work great. I just went to my local VW shop (Foreign 
aide Albuquerque) and bought the single port intakes.

&lt;&lt; Hi there,
 
 Speaking of manifolds and crabs, is there such a thing as a single-port,
 dual carb setup?  Would it be worth it?  I'm thinking of putting dual carbs
 in my '67 (eventually), but don't want to go to dual-port with this engine
 (1600 with c/w crankshaft and torque cam).  I'll build me a monster later if
 need be...I just want strong reliability for now!
 
 In the process of trying to clean out/re-organize the mess in my garage, I
 came across a dual-port, single carb manifold....it was thrown in the box of
 parts and junk that came with my '67.  It may or may not be used...it's hard
 to tell.  It looks good.....
 
 Anyway, I want to know if anyone wants it, what it's worth, and should I
 bring it with me to KP? &gt;&gt;
