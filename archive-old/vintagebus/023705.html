Subject: body replacement panel question.

Hi all,

I have a '64 Campmobile that needs some body work. I have 2 questions
regarding this.

1. The piece on the cargo floor that the bottom latches go into is
called what? This needs replaced but I am having trouble identifying it
in my RMMW catalog.

2. On my hinge carrier, one side appears to be missing the threads for
the bolts for the decklid. Is there an easy fix for this or should I
just weld in a new hinge carrier?

I know that there are several sources for the parts and they vary
somewhat in quality. I am looking at RMMW and Das Bulli Haus. If anyone
thinks that is a BAAAAAD idea please let me know.

Thank you.
