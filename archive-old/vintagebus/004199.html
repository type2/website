Seems like a long time since I've been on the list.  I drove the 60 =
standard from Winnipeg, MB to Kingston, ON early in August.  That's =
about 1500 problem free miles whooo hoooo.  I won't bore (sp?) the list =
with a trip report but I did see a 23 window being towed west while I =
was traveling east.  Saw the bus maybe, just west of Sault Ste. Marie.  =
I also had a major compute collapse.  The lap top died.  Thank God I =
bought the extended warranty - got a brand new machine - but lost all of =
those vintagebus responses - damn!  Anyway - great to be back.
