Subject: Re: [VB] search function page and distributor questions

If your gonna drive it on the street, Id go with a vac
dizzy... for drag racing a 009 is ok tho....
the vac dizzy senses engine load, like taking off from
a dead stop... it knows your under a load at low rpms
and gives the advance needed... an 009 senses RPM, but
has no idea what load is being put on the engine...
and the advance curve on the 009 varies wildly from
unit to unit... 
If you drive like your in a drag race everywhere you
go, neck snappin starts, you can go with the 009... if
you want a nice smooth take off with smooth shifts, go
vac...
but some people swear by the 009... I got a whole box
of em that i would love to swap for some good vac
dizzys...

&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum advance is the only way to go if you drive it
&gt; in traffic IMHO. More
&gt; driveability, and better gas milage.
