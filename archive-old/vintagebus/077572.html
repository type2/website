Subject: 1500 tunnel tranny in my split case '57 bus

With lots of advice (thanks guys and gals) and calulations I've come to 
realise that basically the simplest way to upgrade my stock '57 1200 
split case tranny is to fit a 1500 setup (not 1-ton) from a '64-'67 (was 
thinking t1 gt box + r.boxes, but it's just not worth the hassle for a 
4mph increase over stock 1500 split setup!)  - remember I want to retain 
stock ride height.

So I guess I need an adaptor to either:

bolt the later tranny to the early torsion bar mount point (preferable - 
but is this possible ????? would the shift rod line up etc., does a 
later mount just bolt straight on anyway? - it kind of looks like the 
mount bolts are actually in the same position anyway in the factory 
workshop manual.

OR

bolt the early nose cone to the later tranny with a suitable adaptor 
plate - does anyone make these or does anyone have a pattern as I have a 
nice plasma cutter : ).
