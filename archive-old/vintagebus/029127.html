Subject: Re: [VB] Taunting the Vintage Nazis 

I think I explained clearly why my split is perfect for the hack... But
if I must clarify...

Why should I have to deal with a type 4 motor, jacking the body up and
all that crap... Premium prices for type4 stuff... I've rebuilt a '74
motor, so I know about all that.

I want the best of both worlds... I want the simplicity of a splitty,
and the amenities of a late model bus.

My bus has been on the road for the last 5 years, and will be on the
road for a long time from now. It is my daily driver, my only driver,
and my future driver...

That's the bottom line. I can't see a logical argument against it...

david
