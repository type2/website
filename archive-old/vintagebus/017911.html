does anybody else subscribe to the wolfsberg west monthly newsletter...they
send out info on their newest stuff available, and usually have on technical
tip along with some other stuff.

Anyway today i received their email...supposedly they have the rubber
reproduced for the washer bottles. But when i went to their site it said they
were sold out.

anyway keep your eyes out(i can't imagine they sold out in one day/must be a
computer glitch) if you happen to be looking for these things. Is this
something that you would stock ronnie?
