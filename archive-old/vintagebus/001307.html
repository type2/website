I have wasted several hours developing 2 styles of ID badges for OCTO/VW
Classic. It was more fun than what I was supposed to be doing. As I posted
before, these are printed on CD-ROM labels, 4 in. diameter with a hole in
the middle. They will be very easy to recognize.
The first is a full-color badge with VintageBus_dot_com across the top, color
logos for the VW Classic and OCTO (surreptitiously lifted off the Internet)
and a place for your name.The second badge is the same basic style, with
black and white VW logos instead of the color logos.  The first style will
only be available by placing your requests with me before the shows. I will
print them to order with your name on them and mail them to you or bring
them to the show as you prefer.The second style I will bring blank to the
show for those who neglect to place their requests in advance. I am also
making similar style 8-1/2 x 11 sheets to identify your bus.
   So, if you would like a full-color, pre-printed ID badge for you and your
bus, speak now. Hell, I'll even put your buses name on the big sheet if you
want. It beats doing real work. It would help me a lot if everyone would let
me know in advance, so I don't have to print up a lot of labels that won't
get used.
