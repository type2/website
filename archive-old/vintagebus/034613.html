Most of the stuff I suggested before can be done w/o major work.  
Making sure the fresh air hoses are good, and their connections through to 
the heater boxes are leak free. (very important)
no gaps in tin, 
good eng compartment lid seal 
tune up
etc

FWIW, the motor in my 65 westy is the one I got with it.  It was DP when I 
got it, and I thrashed on it and a spark plug took some head with it so I 
converted it to SP last year, new rod bearings, rebuildt heads, same pc and 
cs and rings. mEasured it for CR, is about 7.3 to 1, but I have no idea how 
many total miles are on it. no full flow, but that would be nice if it was.  
DPs die on me I dont know why.  They just hate me.  Like I have this toaster 
than only burns toast for one person.  any one in the world can make perfect 
toast with this toaster except Rob.  It burns his toast.  It just does.  DPs 
don't like me, they die.  what can I say?

&lt;&lt; Since I started tis thread, I've gotten a lot of feedback from you all and 
I
 appreciate it.
 Many of you have these great engines that you know every second of run time
 on.  Full-flowed, type 4 coolers and big fans.  Great, my problem is, I have
 an older engine of unknown size ( should be a 1600 but.....),mileage, fan
 size, stock doghouse cooler, yada, yada, yada.
 In other words, an unknown quanity.
 Now some of you may see my concern about a 1000mi trip in 110+ temps.
 
 Before any of you suggest tearing down to check things, making modifications
 et al.  I live in an apartment right now where I CAN'T work on the van at
 this time.
 I have a few places I can and do do work on the van but, I have to confine
 it to things I can do in a day.  If any of you have any ideas on what I can
 do in a few hours to help me feel more comfortable on the trip ( other than
 a tune up and changing oil), please feel free to suggest.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Jon &gt;&gt;
