I recently pulled my radio, and am planning on sending it to that guy named
Brad to fix the on/off switch.

I also pulled my speaker, and picked a new one up at R*dio Sh#ck. Seems like
the speaker should be a perfect fit.

I remember pulling the fabric cover out of the dash when I pulled teh radio
last year, and I have it saved somewhere or other(i'd need to dig around for a
while to find it). I remember that it was pretty rotted out. Anyone know where
to get a similar fabric, or the same fabric?

It is the stuff that goes behind the grill so you can't see through the
grillto the speaker or to the tray. 

I was also wondering how this thing is supposed to be attached? I thought
maybe it was just glued in place with some type of adhesive.
