Subject: voltage drop and radio

Hi list

So I rigged up a voltage drop for my windshield wipers and ..... the move
very slowly - I'm happy with them though because the wiper motor is now
very, very quite.  When it was running on 12 volt the blades moved really
fast but the motor howled like a banshee ....

I do ramble! Anyway, I'm wondering about a 6 volt radio.  If I installed it
with a voltage drop should it work perfectly?  My guess is yes but ..... the
list knows all.

The list is kinda like a Quaker Meeting ... don't ya think ... I congregant
gets moved to say something and just spouts it out ..... hoping for a
consensus that just never seems to come ...maybe instead of being called the
Society of Friends we should called the Society of Transporter ..... ah
never mind.
