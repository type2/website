Subject: bearing trade

slightly off topic, but only slightly:
I have 2 sets of 2 LARGE bearings that I would like to trade for RGB
bearings for the 65, or any cool part, for that matter :)
They are MILSPEC annular ball bearings, one set is #3110-155-6356  dsa
500-69-m-zp83  mfr prt # 6020 2zj
These are 6&quot; across, id roughly 4.75&quot;
Next pair is 3110-9355-638  other numbers say flz xb3 378.49  and
54605p2067002b. These are LARGE, nearly 9&quot;od, 8&quot;id.
These were surplused from the USAF around 72, and are still in the original
foil wrapping and WAX (tho I took one of each out of the cardboard box to
lok at 'em...).
I figure that we have SO many members with interesting jobs/hobbies, that
these might be of some interest to one of you, and perhaps we can trade
something? Coz they sure as heck won't fit in my RGB ;)
Perhaps someone is making a large lazysusan?
I also have a Jamar cutting brake set-up for sale/trade, if any of you run
buggies on the side........
