&gt;&gt;I guess I misrepresented my problem. My starter works fine. The  Bus turns 
over no problem, it just that it has to turn over several times  before it 
fires up and then will only fire up if I push the accelerator down  about half 
way. Not sure what that is an indication of, too rich? Too lean?  Something 
else?  &lt;&lt;
Hi Dan,
Not at all!!  We have seen many of time where just enough voltage will  get 
through the electrical system and this will cause problems with starting  even 
with the starter turning over the engine.  We have had 6 volt starter  on 12 
volt system turn over our 1641SP engine just fine, but not start the  engine 
when it was warm.  Turned out the starter bushing was so worn the  starter was 
sucking up the voltage and not enough to the coil to get  proper spark.  So it 
really helps to make sure the electrical system is up  to snuff  before 
tinkering with the carb.
