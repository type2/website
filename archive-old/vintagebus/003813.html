Subject: Check all vw parts stuff

I got another call the other day from a guy that had a engine from a 87 bus
and some other vw stuff, would I be interested, of course I thought NO so I
never went to see him, then he called back and said he &quot;really&quot; needed to
get rid of this stuff so I agreed to go by and look at it.


The engine was a Dual Port not from a 87, BUT what else did he have......
One of those middle seats that got taken out way
back when! Perfect and I do mean Perfect! I don't believe it has ever been
sat on!

The sad thing is I don't need a split 2/3 Middle Bus Seat!

So, the next time you get that call about that old vw stuff, no matter what
they think they have go check it out!

Have a great Week End All!

Meredith

ps  anyone have a description of a ZVW153204 roof rack?
