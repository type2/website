&gt; Thanks to everyone who checked out the page. I got 159 hits on the page since I posted! I know it's pretty dumb that &quot;non-members&quot; can't veiw the pictures. That's Yahoo's rule, not mine.  If you are interested in joining, just look for the &quot;Join This Club&quot; link in the upper right of the page. It's kind of hidden.  If you don't have an account with Yahoo, its pretty nice. Once you register you get an e-mail box, a personalized news page, and access to online clubs. Thanks for your time!

In other words, it's a scam for yahoo to harvest info.

There's lotsa free, unfettered websites out there - and free servers that don't 
require visitors to supply demographic info to view them.
