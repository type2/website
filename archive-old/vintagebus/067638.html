Subject: 1967 camper project bus for sale $800 or trade North Central
  Florida

1967 Camper bus thats missing most of the camper stuff. There is no engine 
or front glass (at this time). The front end has been replaced with one from 
a '71(up) with disc brakes. The original front end is in the bus. A previous 
owner started doing work on the bus and quit. He/she was putting in tear 
drop taillights but could be changed back to original. The picture is the 
one that I saw before I bought it. More to come after I get my other 
computer fixed. If local and you want to come look at it, just let me know. 
It does have some normal bus rust issues, but it could be made into a decent 
daily driver. I will also be making a trip to North Central Indiana in 
March, so delevery between Gainesville FL and Kokomo Indiana might be 
possible. I will not part it out nor will I sell it to someone that is. It 
does have a clean Florida title.
