Subject: Bad Engine News.

My 250 mile old engine has bit the dust. Seems that the brass dizzy drive
gear is about shot. Anyone else seen this? What causes it? My engine builder
says he has seen this 3 other times in the last 200 engines that he has
built. He did not offer a cause.

So, out with the engine this weekend and back to the builder.

Ideas and thoughts appreciated.

TIA
Chris
