Subject: Re: [VB] Top 5 Books

True, the Bentley manual is a reprint of the original two-volume
official VWAG Transporter Workshop Manual.  I started out with a copy of
the Bentley reprint via JC Whitney (only $60), and eventually I was able
to pick up each volume of the original (complete with grease smudges)
via that unmentionable online auction site.  The original typically
sells there for around $75 per volume, whenever one does appear.

I've heard that story about the Bentley manual being an abridged version
of the original (from no less a source than Bob Hoover, et al), but when
I compared the two page-by-page I actually could not find much
significant difference!

&gt; As I understand it, the reprinted Bentley is an abridgement of some
&gt; larger manual set that VW used.  It'd be neat to have the big manual
&gt; set, if it exists.
