Subject: Re ice pick handles--

YEE Gads!   Am i getting beat-up on this!  Never will i give up Magoo! Forgive me guys,
Magoo is NOT available! I really meant to say I will buy or trade for ice -pick handles
from Her, VW Stuff collection--Our 63 23 was from Florida--and the handles are not in to
good of shape--The 63 23 has under 54,000 miles--original paint --no dents--showing some
surface rust, free, from Florida--interior seats and panels are cherry--some tears in the
headliner--no dents--original spare tire and cover. We have had the bumpers and wheels
powder coated and new white walls--Sealing wax red/Gray biege. New sunroof--3.88 tranny
and rebuilt RGB. We have been busy! Due to it sitting for 14 years, rust got into the
tranny and RGB. New carb--generator--starter--you know the plan when a vehicle just sits.
But &quot;Sam&quot; is looking great--hours and hours cleaning the unfaded paint-  Magoo was working
right along side of me--replacing all the door rubber and polishing the deluxe trim and
installing new red insert--repainted the middle seat frame--all the pop-out hinges for
some reason are perfect!
Original AM/FM radio and clock work. Came with a rusted ambulance step that found a new
owner in Everett Barnes--I'm sure he will get it to work. &quot;Sam&quot; has a type III case and
the motor appears to be fine. A little different importing some East Coast rust to
Aridzona--But it is a cool original ride--My thanks to all for getting &quot;Sam&quot;
roadworthy--and my never ending Love for Magoo in holding me together in getting this show
on the road--uj
