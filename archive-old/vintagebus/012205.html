Just a thought - the commercial is pretty dumb, I agree, but hey, you DID remember what it was about, didn't you?  Could be at least one motive was accomplished there by the ad firm. But yeah, I know, did it make the &quot;product&quot; look good, etc, etc, etc.  VW made its reputation on eclectic commercials.

OK - OK! Not list material!  (Sorry)
