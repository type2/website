Subject: [VB] YOUR YARD, MY YARD, OUR VEE-DUBS.

Honestly i gotta tell yal' i feel that this subject has really stirred 
something up. I as a new member would like to say that i enjoy hearing all 
the different points of view. I know this is'nt a chat room, I wouldnt know 
one if i was standin in it, but its great to know this list is out there. I 
have gone to many car shows where i have seen guys, and gals, slingin their 
wares and thought; i bet me and this person have something, or someone in 
common, but what do you say when you cant afford those cherry dash knobs? 
this list to me is a way to meet all the people that obviously feel some 
kind of love for their vw's and want to converse with someone else feelin 
the same way, of course i guess the primary goal would be to help the less 
informed(like me).
while i cant afford a home of my own i do hope to some day, and while my BIG 
daydream is to have the oldest vw chicken coop arround, i can respect the 
idea that not everyone would enjoy looking out the window over their morning 
coffee at it, but i am a boonie man and will probably crawl back out there 
someday. well please forgive my romanticism, i do enjoy rollin down the 
street and spotting those all too familliar attractive curves, if everyone 
put their busses on the front lawn, i might be able to score my coop.
again forgive me.
