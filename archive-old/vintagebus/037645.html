Subject: Re: identical valve stem height 



Is it important to have identical valve stem height?  I noticed that the 
valve
stems on my rebuilt heads don't have identical heights.  One of the exhaust 
valves is about 2mm lower than the two intakes, and the other exhaust is 
about
1 mm lower.

Will this affect me when I am trying to setup my rocker arm geometry?

It's not really important unless the valves are sticking way out.  Are 
your valves sunk really deep into the seat?  If so, the machinist who 
rebuilt your heads should have grinded the stem down to compensate for 
the deep seat.

Good luck,

Jeff
