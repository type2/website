Gabriel, the key guy, comes down to Madera every year with his key
cutting equipment &amp; spare bits for sale. He didn't have blanks for my
'63 DC  last year, but should have them this time. We get vendors, the
bay window high top guy, locals (me &amp; others), Sarah's toys, etc. Price
is right, free parking, can of food to get in. $10 to enter your car,
$15 to swap. No reservations, under the trees at the Madera fairgrounds.
Hot Wheels racing (they're good for something?), live band, push drags.
Wish they would have slow drags so I could mop up with my electric
Thing! Idle rpm? One. It's been in the 80's this week, last week we had
40-50 highs and drizzle! I'm able to offer hospitality Saturday &amp; Sunday
evening if you're coming through, pmail.

Drove the H*nda up to San Jose last Sunday morning for the Kelley Park
show. We didn't hang out as much as I wanted, but my 3 traveling
companions own zero VW's and I have 4. Couldn't flash my home made
T-shirt with VintageBus and Things-Digest with all the rain gear. Coat
hooks for a Deluxe go for $25!  Repro center jailbar supports are $20,
drilled crooked! We'll try Pomona again when the 21 window project gets
underway.

After 1.5 hours we headed for the car and back to the central valley.
Highlight of the trip was a stop at the antique stores in Gilroy. Scored
a Pyramid Draft Pale Ale tap handle AND nitro tap for the price of a tap
handle. Passed on a BuddyL 21 window toy bus without a dash &amp; other
problems, $45.
