Subject: Re: Polishing Deluxe Trim

I have found a great way to polish the trim, but you have to have a
Drill Press.
Cut a piece of plywood about 1/8 inch narrower than the trim and attach
the trim the the plywood (this helps to keep it from bending or burning
your hand). Attach a 4&quot; buffing pad to the drill press (any hardware
store) and buff the trim both sideways and lengthwise. Of course you
need some red rouge compound and some white brightening compound as
well. On your last pass, go very lightly to get the nicest finish. If
you have any dings, you can lightly sand the area with 400 sandpaper and

then steel wool, then polish it very hard and hot and it will kind of
melt it into looking great. We still polish trim this way but have
graduated to a 6hp pro buffer with 14&quot; buff pads.
If you have an extra piece, you can practice until you have the
technique down pat.
As far as taking out dents, you can do this on the bus with a hard
rubber mallet if you are brave enough to give it a try. Try drumming
(instead of hammering like you would do to a nail) the area you need to
take the &quot;ding&quot; out of. You will find that it makes taking the ding out
pretty easy and remolds the trim the the shape of the bus and doesn't
dent the bus either.
Good luck and let me know how it has turned out for you.


Good luck,
Gary
