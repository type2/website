Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

On my old 67 westy the passenger rear would loosen up to the point that it
would start sounding like a flat. Scary in traffic. I eventually replaced
the wheel, drum, and lug bolts with those from a parts bus and it never
happened again. Other than that I've never even found one loose. I don't
torque them to spec. I do stand on the breaker bar but no measurement. I
figured a fat man bouncing had to be just about right. maybe this should be
the new standard?

&gt;
&gt; There's gotta be a better way to keep these wheels on the busses.
&gt; I've heard story after story of wheels coming off VW's and had one do
&gt; the same to me.
&gt;
&gt; Is it the fact that they use lug bolts instead of studs and lugnuts?
&gt; What are some recomendations for keeping the wheels on ....other than
&gt; &quot;torque to the specs as per the bentley&quot;. We all know that. Sometimes
&gt; doesn't seem to work though. 4000 miles isn't that much.
&gt;
&gt;   I've never had another brand vehicle even have the lugnuts loosen up
&gt; at all. Must be a flaw in the design of lug bolts. Why did they do it
&gt; that way?
