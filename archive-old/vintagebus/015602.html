I had to pass this story on, my chinese friend Qiao[pronounced chow] told me.
Qiao in Chinese means something like lumberjack.

It is a nice sunny day, there are two Qiaos. One is relaxing, sitting in the
shade of a tree, the other is working away cutting down trees...the
conversation begins with the working Qiao.

-Why are you just sitting under the tree, why don't you do some work, and cut
down some trees?
-Why would I want to cut down some trees?
-So you could have some lumber.
-What would I do with the lumber?
-You can take the lumber to the market and sell it.
-Why would I want to sell it?
-So you could earn some money, and put it in the bank.
-Why do I want to save some money in the bank?
-So you can enjoy your life, and relax?

-Hey Qiao, what is I am doing right now?
