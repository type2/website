Subject: ERCO ?? Off Set rims for lowered vws
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi guys, I heard there was a company named ERCO who
sometimes advertizes in Hot VWS.

Anyhow...I heard they manufacture off set rims for
VWs...thus elliminating the need to narrow front beams
when excessive lowering is done.

Anybody heard of these rims or this company?  Any and
all info on each is greatly appreciated.

Thanks
tds
