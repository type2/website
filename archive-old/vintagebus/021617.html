Hi Adam,
Wiring is best done by keeping it as simple as possible.  Running wiring down 
and outside is asking for trouble, especially with a resistor hanging down 
there.  We clamp our resistors to our upper forward upper package tray edge.  
After all 90% of the time you will use the wipers is during cool to cold 
weather, and a little heat under the dash is not going to hurt you buses 
interior and thusly keep the wire length as short as possible.  Also you 
would be wise to measure the voltage getting to the wiper motor to insure it 
is not too high.  We have found it takes two of those resistors in line to 
drop the flow low enough.  Lastly replace the grease in you wiper motors gear 
box with white or clear lithium and only fill it about 1/4 to 1/3 full.  Not 
the heavy axle grease.  Makes the wiper motor work far easier and you do not 
have to shout over it like we used to have over our 1960 panel camper wipers.
