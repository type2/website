&gt; &gt; Listees,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Has anyone heard how Erin did in his dealings with B.E.? Just
&gt; wondering
&gt; &gt; whether to put B.E. on my &quot;black list.&quot; I'd ask Erin but last I heard
he'd
&gt; &gt; signed off for a while.


NOTE:
this is a cross-post from the VintageVW list from NQ.  Looks like everything
worked out OK.

Merry Christmas everybody and thanks for everything;   appologies to the
'Scrooge' admin who didnt want holiday posts out here :-)

I received this from Erin last Thursday.  Here it is in its entirety:

&gt; Somehow James, I've been put back on the vintagvw list.  I was unsubbed
for
&gt; a while and got the official signoff notice and then it started up again
&gt; today for a few messages at least.  Is there like a big campaign to get me
&gt; back on the list or something?
&gt;
&gt; Here's the latest - I got a call at work while I was unloading a semi of
&gt; lumber.  It was Ron Barrett of Barrett Enterprises.  Somehow he got a copy
&gt; of a message from Kevin Gallagher which was the original post I made about
&gt; all the crappy parts I got.
&gt;
&gt; We talked for a good 15 minutes and he sincerely seemed like he wanted to
&gt; make amends for the problems.  First off, he said the lifters are ground
&gt; with a slight curvature on a 'DPR?' machine but not as curved as a new
&gt; lifter.  As for the heads, they get them from GEX.  We've all heard enough
&gt; about GEX to know why I'm having problems.  Here's something interesting
&gt; though - Ron Barrett told me that the typical industry standard term
&gt; 'rebuilt' for VW heads usually means that everything is checked to see if
&gt; it's within spec.  The intake valves are reused, the exhaust valves are
NOT,
&gt; seats reground, and guides replaced only if out of spec. (usually the
&gt; exhaust guides end up being replaced.)
&gt;
&gt; It was totally Ron's suggestion that to remedy the situation that they do
&gt; the following:
&gt;
&gt; Send me a new set of 4 intake valves and 4 exhaust valves...
&gt; Send me a new set of 8 guides
&gt; A set of new lifters (not reground)
&gt; A check for $50.
&gt;
&gt; I told him I thought that was more than a fair deal.  He said I wouldn't
&gt; have to send the lifters back but I'm going to anyway because I don't need
&gt; them.  Ron seemed apologetic and said he's been in the VW business for 30
&gt; years and wanted to make sure I was happy.  He was concerned about his
&gt; reputation and simply wanted to make amends for this whole thing.  When he
&gt; told me not to give up on the bus, that was also another tip-off that
&gt; someone on the net had notified him.
&gt;
&gt; I'm kind of happy that I'm getting this stuff but I feel like I don't
&gt; deserve it.  It ain't my style to bitch and scream to get freebies and it
&gt; seems that is what I've managed to do. :-(  Right now though, I'll at
least
&gt; go through the motions and send in the cores and whatever else is supposed
&gt; to go back and at least get the parts Ron is offering me.  I'm still
pretty
&gt; indifferent about the whole thing though.  I'll still have to decide
whether
&gt; or not to continue working on the bus.  I had a couple of friends come by
&gt; tonight that really want to go to California in the bus - I'd hate to
&gt; disappoint them but at the same time, I'd hate to have to file bankruptcy
&gt; over it too.  Time will only tell.
&gt;
&gt; On the lighter side of things, I took my 2 friends, Brian and Melisa for
an
&gt; airplane ride tonight (rides for charity) and they both thoroughly enjoyed
&gt; it.  It was Melisa's 2nd plane ride and Brian's first and we all had a
good
&gt; time. I call them kids - they are aged 19/20 respectively whereas I'm 28.
I
&gt; paid for it all (despite being broke already and spending emergency money)
&gt; and felt better by treating them out than I have in the past 2 weeks.
&gt;
&gt; And one more thing Jim - Glen Hadley has offered to come help me build an
&gt; engine - whether new or good used.  He lives in Iowa City, IA and is going
&gt; to work about 70 miles from here and commute weekly.  On bad weather
&gt; weekends, he said he'd come over and help me out and is entirely insistant
&gt; on me not selling off the bus until he looks at it.  Good ol' Glen.
&gt;
&gt; I'm gonna carbon this message to the vintagebus list so they know what's
&gt; going on.  Take care James.
