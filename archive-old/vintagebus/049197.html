Subject: Friday stuff - Central CA Parade

In the orangish yellow DC
Dove Blue radio blockoff
4 chrome latches holding the windshield in
Black hole where the ash tray won't fit because of the bay wiper mechanism 
Folded up gas pump charge slip with the last fill up's mileage written on it

21 window project
various VW hatch scripts
Mardi Gras beads &amp; confetti
Black hole where the clock goes because I'll ship it to eric&amp;barb someday

Here's an idea. Get a can of blackboard spray paint and make a low-tech memo spot on your dash. 

Are you in Central CA and want to be in a parade Dec. 1st? Pmail me for details.
