Have Eric and Barb ever owned a 54 bus?  My 54 was coated with tar on the 
entire rear floor, walls, and the drivers side of the engine compartment.  It 
probably saved the bus, although the plywood floor did help keep enough water 
there to do some rusting.  It is a pain to get off, so I may just leave it 
there behind the door panels.  I am trying to get it all off of the engine 
compartment.  Anyone have any better ideas than a razor blade and laquer 
thiner?

I had a 54 kombi VIN circa 20- 105340.  IT  had tar coating the inside of the 
engin e compartment.      But not anywhere else.
