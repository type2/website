I'm going to use a type 4 oil cooler in this one, in the swap panel i used a
stock doghouse no heating problems, ran 65-70 mph all day long. loaded and
got 25 mpg to boot. I'm hopeing for 25-30 mpg with this one and be able to
run at70-75 mph, it's in the trans 3.88 with 77 fourth gear.

Hi Ronnie &amp; lists
Sounds like the engine we built for the Burrito Express, the only difference

I can see is that we use CB Performance 044 dual port heads, mated to a 
Weber 32/36 progressive.  We went with 6.8:1 compression and the end product

was a good running engine that made lots of heat.  Last weekend we bumped 
the compression to 7.9:1 and the result is a much cooler running engine that

_likes_ to cruise at 3650 RPM (indicated 70 mph).  Ir runs much better, revs

much more willingly, and has a much better throttle response.  Now you've 
got me curious, did the swap panel run warm?  What did you use for an oil 
cooler, and what are you planning for this one?  You've just validated what 
we thought when we planned this engine - appreciate that.  good luck with 
it.
Dave

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
