&lt;&lt;  he kept referring to it 
 as a barndoor even though it was a '59. It seems someone he met in the 
 Grateful Dead parking lot in the mid eighty's thought he was a bus genius 
 and told him that! &gt;&gt;

Last summer I was sitting in the Dusseldorf airport on my way back from Bad 
Camberg.  As I was waiting, I was looking at the video I had shot over the 
weekend when a guy in his early 20's asked me what I had shot. When I told 
him it was of a VW show, he told me that he had a '65 barndoor. After I asked 
him a few questions it  turns out he had a '65 double door.  &quot;Naw man, it's 
called a barndoor when they have doors on both sides, they are really rare.&quot; 
I showed him footage of barndoors and double doors, and explained the 
difference, but he still insisted. I thought it was funny that I was leaving 
VW mecca and there is this kid telling me everything I know is wrong.
