Subject: Re: [VB] Re:Paintin' me bus

a guy i worked with painted at work and at home.  at home he never used a
respirator and at work only a 3m dual filtered mask.  he used to think it
was funny when we would look in the booth at him shaking our heads.  now
he's in a wheel chair for life due to it.  this is one of the reasons you
wont meet too many &quot;old&quot; body guys.

&gt; If you are going to be using any TWO PART CATALYZED paint product,
&gt; PLEASE get or rent a SUPPLIED AIR breathing system.  A mask will not
&gt; protect you!  You might not get sick right away, but eventually you'll
&gt; be toting around one of those little O2 bottles with a canulla up your
&gt; nose.  That is if you live!
