Subject: Re: [VB] transmission number
Cc: &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Would someone tell me how to tell which tranny i have in my 66 13 window,
&gt;the numbers on the front of the case are 113 310 171,it takes a 6 volt fly ,
&gt; i would try to research it but im all greasy, im sure you guys know.


What you have is a VW part number, not a transmission serial number.  I
would guess that you have the original, or at least the correct
transmission in your bus.  You bus should have a 'tunnel case' tranny,
meaning that there is no parting seam running down the center of the case
from front to rear.  It should also be a 6 volt tranny.  I think if you
find a number on the nosecone (the part which the front tranny mount bolts
to), it should be number starting with 211, because the bus front tranny
mount is different from the Beetle, but if the number comes off the case or
the side plates, it should be a 113 number, because the all syncro (tunnel
case) tranny first appeared in deluxe Beetles, which have part numbers
starting with 113.  The tranny (except for the nosecone) is the same as a
deluxe beetle tranny, except that the ring gear and carrier have been
installed on the opposite side of the car, to compensate for the gear
reduction boxes at the ends of the rear axles.  The gear ratios may be
different as well, but I once installed a beetle tranny in a bus, and I
don't remember noticing the engine running at different speeds than w/ the
bus tranny (but I was only 16 at the time, so who knows?)...
