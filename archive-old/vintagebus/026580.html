Erin y todos miembros...

    Just took a gander through the RMMW catalog...
    your bearings would be: crank, .010&quot;; case, .060&quot;; thrust, .080&quot;....... they
are .010&quot; smaller for the inside diameter, to account for the metal removed when
the crank was reground, and .060&quot; larger for the outside diameters, to account
for the metal removed from the case. The #1 main bearing, used as a thrust
bearing, is .080&quot; smaller front to back oriented between the thrust flanges, to
account for the metal removed from the case.
    RMMW does not list that bearing.... CB Performance lists the mains... either
a .020&quot;, .040&quot;, or .060&quot; line bore, with sizes of std/.010&quot;/.020&quot;/.030&quot; for the
crankshaft diameter grind spec... below the part numbers it says this: &quot;Please
Note: Special thrust main bearings are available. If you have a special
requirement ask our service desk for further information concerning wide thrust
align bore bearings.&quot;
    contact them at http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/ or 1-800-274-8337....
    JC Whipme didn't have the bearings you need either...
    GEX.... didn't think I'd mention that name again, but they say in their
catalog that they only printed a partial list of bearing sizes, and to call for
the sizes not listed...
    No matter where you end up getting the bearings, my advice would be to
measure everything and make sure it will fit properly, and with the clearances
you desire... no need to trash your baby because someone else made a boo-boo in
critical measurement... my 2 cents. ;)

keep on keepin' on... it'll be worth it all when you it's done :)

&gt; Well the only thing besides money keeping me from working on my bus engine
&gt; are the main bearings.  Since I have a case that has been 60/80'd (align
&gt; bore/thrust) and a crank that is a 10/10 regrind, I guess I need a set of 70
&gt; over main bearings and an 80 over thrust if that makes any sense.  If anyone
&gt; has a new set they'd like to sell me, I'd like to buy them.  Otherwise, I'd
&gt; settle for some good advice on where I can get a set with no hassles and
&gt; cheap. (of course.)
