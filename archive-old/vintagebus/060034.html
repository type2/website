Subject: Help with bus restoration

Hello VW'ers
I am new to this list. My son, after a two year search, has purchased a 66
split window bus.
A great local VW shop has got it in tip-top running shape. The body need
very little work, only a few rust holes. There is however no I mean no
interior.I thought that was good as everthing will be redone from metal up.
It has two pedistals for the front seats that is all.I have found and
ordered two seats from a guy in Fla.That is the extent of my interior
restoration thus far. What I need help with is a plan of attack. What should
I do and in what order. I am afraid I will do something only to find I
should have done something else first. I was planning on putting
sound-proofing/insulation on the bear metal walls, ceiling and rear deck
over the engine.  I have an old VW magazine that lays that out
Sorry to babble on
Thanks in Advance
Tom Megow
Valdosta, Ga
