&gt;Backrest maybe. Seat cushion, no. The rear seat cushion has a section in

the middle front that drops down about 3 in. from the rest of the frame. The

front doesn't have this. Just try swapping the backrests, that will tell the

story there.

&gt;

Are you saying that normal bench front seat bottoms have completely flat

frames while Crew Cab back bench bottoms have a curved section in the frame

with the dropped down section being most of the front of the frame?

I heard that one part of the back seat of a crew cab is the same as one part
of the front seat of a barndoor.       You know, the barndoor front seat is
not quite so padded as the later splits' front seats.
