Stephen,

I just got back from the local Home Base Hardware.  I'm rebuilding a '71 Vespa
and needed all new gaskets for the tank.  They had one in particular that was
pretty large and fit inside the Vespa tank cap to seal it.  I'll try and get
you some measurements on it tonight if you are interested.  I don't know if it
will work but it might be worth a look.
