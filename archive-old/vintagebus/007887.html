Hi,

I am half owner of a special industrial machinery design and manufacturing
firm. We design and build all sorts of conveying and automated assembly,
drilling/tapping/cutting, and what have you, machinery. Been doing it for
almost 9 years.

For all you industrial and manufacturing engineers out there, drop me a line
if you need some special machinery.

Chris Dreike
