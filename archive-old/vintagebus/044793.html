Hi Clara,
The problem is that oil is liquid.  Try putting oil in a glass jar, then pour
in a little water.  Come back later and the water will be on the bottom.  If
oil did such a great job then we could just oil up bare metal and not have
rust in years.  Plus the mess that just a little oil will make of your
windows visability during rains is not pleasant.  We also tried grease in the
seals, silicon sealant, 3M body sealant and a few others that all failed in
less than a year.  Roofing tar has worked with no leakage for over six years
so far.
