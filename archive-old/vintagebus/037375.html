 You can install it, however 3/8 &quot; will need to be cut off the input shaft,
 and the bell housing will have to be changed, and the front trans
 mount....The gearing is very tall in that trans, and a type 1 engine will
 hurt trying to pull a bus, with a stock engine. &gt;&gt;

I have never cut the 3/8 inch off the imput shaft, it works fine with a 1600 
cc motor......

78-79s use a weird starter (maybe earlier), it works with a 1600cc motor , 
but an earlier starter will not work in that tranny bell housing.....

if I had the original 71 tranny I would think of changing the bell 
housing......

Like Jake said, the gearing is not good for a stock 1600cc motor
