&gt; Ok! - any one of these up against my 911?  DVS rotors and Pagid Orange
pads,
&gt; 930 mc &amp; calipers...
&gt;

Okay, you're on. My singlecab will outstop my 69 Vette with 4 wheel 4 piston
discs or the old ladies 93 with antilocks and the same. From the same speed
to stop. Get VWHoward to pay your gas down to Havasu and we'll do the test
in front of Ronnie's shop. Oh yeah, and the 69 would make a distant memory
of your 911 in a straight line, nyah. 8^)

Big blocks don't do twisties near so well as Por$che$ though. Oh yeah, 2 or
3 mpg  on 101 octane leaded gas for those that are interested in such
things. Not a daily driver. For sale though, to any of you folks that
recently sold a barndoor deluxe and have a midlife crisis coming up......
