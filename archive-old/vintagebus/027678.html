I just came from Everetts classified site and saw this thing. I love it! I know this
probably goes against everything a lot of you believe in but I really like it. I
wouldn't build it and at $10,000 for a wavy bus still in Purple primer with what
looks like rattle can black underneath, I am not going to buy it. You can check it
out at the Samba_dot_com under classifieds. The guy welded a deluxe sunroof roof section
and barndoor front overhang (or lack there of) onto an early walk-through double
door panel. Check out the picture of it with the doors out and the sunroof open. It
will be interesting to see if there is enough support there. I guess VW did Double
Door sunroofs so they must be able to take it. I know I am risking any small part of
credibility I may have had (not that I really had any to start with), but I want one
of those!
just had to share,
