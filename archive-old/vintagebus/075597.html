Subject: Re: axle-beam lock-plate problem

&gt;
&gt;I'm currently re-installing my axle-beam. According to the VW workshop
&gt;manual the mounting-bolt lock plates must sit in a particular direction
&gt;(each one is different). I'm having trouble with the upper rearward plate.

I haven't ever done this myself, but I can say that the Bentley isn't
internally consistent with itself.  Compare the diagram of &quot;correct&quot;
lock plate placement (on page V-2 2 in the reprint '63-'67 Bentley)
with other photos before and after it in section V:

V-2 1 bottom  V-4 9 bottom  V-5 3
V-6 1 top     V-6 2 top     V-6 4 middle
V-6 4 bottom  V-6 4a all 3  V-6 4b middle and bottom

The '50-'62 reprint Bentley has almost the same drawing of &quot;correct&quot;
lock plate placement on page V-2 1 -- the plates themselves are in the
same place as in the '63-'67 book.  Most of the other views of the
installed lock plates agree with the drawing:

V-2 1 bottom  V-4 5 left  V-4 6
V-6 1 top     V-6 2       V-6 4 all 3
V-6 5 all 3

Only one is inconsistent: V-7 2.

I also have a bay Bentley and it has pictures that don't match the
&quot;correct&quot; orientation from the earlier Bentleys in section 2, page 19,
figures 7-19 and 7-21.

The '67 parts manual at the doc project (page 255 and 257) agrees that
there should be 8 lock plates (211 499 131) per car.

Again, not having done this myself: It appears that these lock plates
are not meant to be bent up to secure the bolt (like the recently-
discussed RGB/spring plate lock plates).  Rather, it _seems to me_
that the hole is drilled slightly &quot;off-center&quot;, and the plates are
shaped such that they can always be butted up against the lips of
the front axle end plates to counteract a loosening of the front axle
bolts.  It appears that the idea is that if the bolt starts to loosen,
it would tend to move the lock plate counter-clockwise, which would
then hit the end plate lip, which would drive the plate into the
shaft of the bolt, keeping it from turning further.

Having said that, I would suggest two options...

1.  Swap plates around on that end (or on the whole beam) until you
    find a permutation that allows all 4 (8) plates to go on in their
    &quot;correct&quot; positions.  If you have four plates that you know go
    on one end, there are only 24 combinations... if all eight plates
    are free to go anywhere, there are 40,320 combinations.  :)

2.  If you can't get the &quot;correct&quot; position, position the plates so
    that they would be stopped from turning the quickest by a
    counter-clockwise motion.  For the upper rear plate on the
    left-hand side, that would mean pointing the flat down; for
    the upper rear plate on the right-hand side, it would mean up.

I can defend #2 somewhat by noting that in the pictures from all 3
manuals, the lock plates seem to follow the suggested orientation -
they are positioned so that a corner or a flat of the lock plate will
hit an obstruction first when turned counter-clockwise.

Take all this with an appropriate amount of NaCl.  I'm not exactly
sure how these lock plates are supposed to work, but that's my best
guess from looking at the manuals.
