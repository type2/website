Subject: re;67 engine

i have done engines like you are talking about
90.5 p/l
044 big valve heads
69 mm c/w crank
engle 120 cam (a bit to much cam for some)
duel kadrons
stock heater boxes and a guiet pak exhust
had this in a 67 sundial pop-top camper, it got over 22 mpg cruising at
60-65 mph
had tons of bottom end and the hills didn't affect it at all, very
reliable made trips to cal and phoenix 350 miles each way no problems,
had a doghouse all the tin but no inner flaps, i hope this info helps or
try a stock 1600 with duel kadrons and 1.25 ratio rockers
did this combo on a 21 window and it worked awesome 25 mpg plus daily
driver and no problems.
