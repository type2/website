X-ACNS-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Terms (was Re: And the saga begins)

&gt; From: surlygirl_at_email_dot_com
&gt; this morning i endured an argument on a work-related (library) list 
&gt; about what area north america covered.

I often hear people clarifying whether or not Mexico is in north 
america.  (VW connection - Puebla :-)

&gt; now back to buses, is it spelled &quot;buses&quot; or &quot;busses?&quot;  also are there 
&gt; standard terms for old vehicles and what we do with them?  do i have 
&gt; to call in the librarians?  &lt;grin&gt;

&quot;Bring 'em on.&quot;  Depending on the audience, I call them &quot;old VWs&quot; or 
&quot;vintage VWs&quot;.  What we do with them -- you mean the legal stuff, 
right?  I say &quot;tinker&quot; a lot.  &quot;Fix up&quot;.  Mess with.  Play with.  I can 
see the argument for limiting &quot;restoration&quot; to original-stock efforts, 
but OTOH anyone who revives a decrepit old VW and makes it look half 
decent deserves some props.  And it drives me nuts (deservedly so) when 
someone sees me in my not-terrible-looking bus and says, &quot;So, you 
planning to restore that?&quot;  Grrr.  It *is* restored compared to how it 
looked before, dude. :-)

&gt; From: &quot;J. P. Henriksen&quot; &lt;a59camper_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I've always wondered about that one.  They both have
&gt; rags on top, so which is a real ragtop?

Repeating from p-mail, I think if you check online car-fancier 
glossaries and such you'll find that only in the VW community does 
&quot;ragtop&quot; not mean a convertible or drop-head coupe.  And I think it's 
at least partly due to the illiterati at the magazines.

You can have even more fun arguing whether VW ragtops (real ragtops) 
are cabriolets or convertibles.

How many people out there find that people refer to your bus (not a SC 
or DC or even panel) as a &quot;truck&quot;?  Whazzup with that?
