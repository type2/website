David:

Those urethane mounts are difficult to break, but we have seen alot of them
with the holes ovaled out. The problem is, if the nuts and bolts get loose,
the movement of the transmission seems to pound against the sides of the
mounting hardware holes in the urethane. They don't bounce back as easily as
rubber.

Just make sure you check them on a regular basis to make sure everything
stays tight. Even nylock nuts don't always stay tight.

Thank You!

&gt; My front tranny mount went out on me this weekend.
&gt;
&gt; I installed a urethane front tranny mount in my baby today.
