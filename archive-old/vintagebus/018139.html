The expense and effort of going to 4-lug wheels far outweighs the cost
of those 4 tires.  Your best bet would be to just buy new 14&quot; tires.
Your second option is to scrounge up a set of 15&quot; bus wheels.

&gt; I have a wrecked super beetle with brand new tires on it. They are the 15 in
&gt; stock 4 lug wheels. My bus has the 14in 5 lug wheels. I would really like
&gt; the new tires on my bus since my funds are limited right now. Can I get 4
&gt; lug drums that fit the bus and take beetle rims? Or do I need to try to get
&gt; 15 in bus rims. Changing drums would be the easiest it seems but Im not sure
&gt; if it works. I know beetle drums are too small. How hard is it to find the
&gt; 15 in bus rims? HELP!
