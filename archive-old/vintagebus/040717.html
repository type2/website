Subject: gas heaters
Date: Thu, 03 Sep 98 00:12:52 PDT

Hey gang,  I found a stash of gas heaters, most of them are S/W's.
                The guy also has an Eber#$^&amp; , mint and will not part with 
                 it! :&gt;(  beutiful piece of german engineering though. This
                dude raided canadian junkyards for years, whats a s/w unit 
                worth? operational vs. ? He still runs an S/W in his bay
                all winter. warm feet ....mmmmmmm 
                 Recent acqusition of a 65 21 with a 40 hp and has the 
                forward switch  for the gas heater! Makes the gas unit 
                 atractive. Bus also has a front seat to match my middle
                  and rear. Now does any one have a passenger front
                 white insert w/ teal-acqua sides? The 21 will be on the 
                 market in the northeast. Any interest? 

66/ 13 
65/ 21
30 REO 1.5 ton- soon
57 sunroof bug
69 911 on the rotiss
and an 87 Saab Conv mint,still parked, destined for winter ski travel
cause the bus is practical? cool? fun?
