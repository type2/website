&gt;&gt;&gt; Could a crack in the solenoid here cause this kind of trouble????   &lt;&lt;
Hi Matt,
Could be that was your problem, but the only way to find out is to replace 
the solinoid and then check for any voltage drop in the wiring to the front 
through the fuse box, light switch, ignition switch, and back to the solinoid.  
Did you rebuild your head light switch and solder the clips in the fuse box 
together as in the article in the type2_dot_com library Matt Roberds and us wrote?
