Jack Maynard wrote &quot;If you all don't believe this story, ask Ty, he knows all
about it.
And ask him about his 412 in Ensenada. There is a fire story&quot;

Story confirmed! I think he even still wears that burnt up t-shirt on occasion.
Jack never throughs anything out. As for the $75 412 I can't remember and all
the evidence is gone.
