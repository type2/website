&gt;if i get the new dual port from ronnie, i need to get a new carb, the only
ones available have a 12volt electric choke...anyone have any experience
with running these on a 6volt bus? &lt;

I think RMMW has a choke that is 6 volt for the 28 and 31 carbs...  Or if
you listen to Muir you do not need a choke :)  Also you may need to change
the carb electromagnetic cut-off switch, but I am not sure if it matters
what voltage....  Or you can clip the pin in there and not worry about it :)

For your needs it sounds like you should just stay with a SP engine.  Get
the studs changed like Eric and Barb said there you go.

BTW, the carb adapters suck!  You can get them to work nicely but you need
to grind them and polish them to get them to fit and look nice.  The
castings are horrid.  You may have this nightmare ahead of you unless you
have a 34PICT-3 sitting around, then to get a 34 running right is another
headache granted some have down to a science... or are really lucky :)


Good Luck,
