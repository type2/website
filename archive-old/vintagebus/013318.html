Another wierd tale . . .

Dick and his cousin . . have whipped together a 
wind-tunnel for this guy who races trucks at
Bonneville Flats . . .

His cousin the model-maker (makes cabinets for a living)
has a 1/12 scale model of this Mack truck . .

The tunnel itself they copied from pictures off the net.

The wind maker is a propeller for a model air-plane.
The motor for same used to be a wood-router . .

They have done some rather clever things tho . .

To get the over-all drag, they put the model on wheels
and tied the front beam to a concealed scale underneath.

It reads out in grams . . . which need not translate
to anything . . you just make less drag your goal . .

It seems that for a scale model of 1/X, the wind 
currents will also be 1/X . .  ie., you want 200 mph
full scale but have a 1/4 scale model, wind speed required
is only 50 mph . .

Anybody have better data, lay it on me . . :-)

Now they needed to know the wind speed . . .

Radio shack has some cheap electric motors, DC . . 
(battery driven stuff) couple dollars for the good ones.
The Hobbey shop didn't have any props that would fit 
the shafts but they had some &quot;Impellors&quot; that would.

Impellor just has more than a single row of vanes . .

It is plastic and would just push on the shaft of the 
motor . . 

Now you stick that in the wind tunnel and read the 
current generated by the motor being turned by the 
impellor or propeller . . .

To calibrate the motor, they got in the car and drove 
down the road at various speeds while cous' read the 
digital vom with the motor/prop hanging out the window.

Then they ran into &quot;Coriolis affect&quot; (sp)  . .
the wind wants to smash everything up against one wall
of the tunnel . .

Dick has a new word called &quot;Laminar&quot; that he has used 
about 40 times on me so far . . they are putting straight
vanes in the tunnel in front of the blower as we speak . .

Some aero-space guy(retired) told them they needed 
4 colors of smoke going thru there to really tell anything
but so far they have been using colored yarn taped to
the surface they are eye-balling . .

They have a precision manometer (borrowed) but don't 
know how to use it and as you can see, they wont 
need it . . :-)
