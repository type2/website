   Home Depot has the Lincoln for $309 plus $90 for the Gas conversion.  I
saw the Lowes here today had the Lincoln for $299, but didn't notice the
price of the Gas conversion.
    Funny thing is, after all the negative about the Cambpell Hausfield
model being junj and no parts available.  Lowes has about everything you
need for the CH model and a 5 year warranty,  No parts at all for the
Lincoln.  Don't get me wrong, I value everyone's opinion here a great deal.
Also agree with Lincoln being a better name.

Dave
