Subject: Re: [VB] gear oil

If the Mobile synthetic GL5 uses phosphorus and sulfur compounds to get 
the GL5 rating, then it will be just as bad for your synchronizers as 
regular GL5. GL numbers have to do with the pressure rating of the oil. 
Redline makes a synthetic GL4. Look for MT-90 under the products pull down.
