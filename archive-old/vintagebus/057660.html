       Sure can hit the trigger and if you do it enough in one spot you have 
a nice deep crater that is so work hardened you can't do a thing with it, but 
throw mud at it.
       Too truly shrink metal, you must move it.  As I've said in the past, 
metal is a lot more fluid than most folks think.  Think of it as a bunch of 
molecules hang'n out.  Things are cool till they get hit, suddenly these poor 
little molecules are pulled apart from one another (stretched).  The idea 
behind shirking is to move these little molecules back together.
       After you heat your metal you need to push the metal back into the 
center of the heat.  This is done with a dolly and a body hammer.  You back 
the metal up with the dolly and hit and slide with the hammer toward the 
center.  The hit and slide movement is hard to explain, but you hit and slide 
the face of the hammer in the same motion.  Granted there are special 
shrinking hammers out there, but you can get by with a simple body hammer and 
not spend money you don't have to.  Once the red glow of the metal fades, hit 
it with air to make sure things are cool.  Then run your body file over it to 
check the highs and lows.  Shrink more if you need to, but try to keep the 
heat to a minimum  With some practice you can get your metal back to about an 
1/8 of an inch below level.  If you really get anal on it you can get back to 
a 1/16 which is what the BMW and Mercedes dealerships that I did work for 
required.
                                                                              
               Peace,
