Subject: Listees at BBBV - GPS Speed-o-meter calibration

Last year John Howard rounded up the listees for a photo op. Any volunteers to host a rendezvous? A single cab is a great stand-around spot as a suggestion. Maybe it'd be easier to have the non-listees go somewhere for a while if we outnumber 'em. 

I've got a GPS and Palm Pilot that will display speed to the .00's. Find me at BBBV and I'll lend it to you. Plan to have a copilot, it's not easy to read it and drive at the same time.
