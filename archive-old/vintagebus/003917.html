Thanks for all the replies and pics.  I love the way this formula works on
bugs and ghias.....but I'll say this at risk of seeming stupid:  I have,
indeed, seen this color on a bus....several, in fact.  The '65 Deluxe
walkthrough I am hoping to get before it turns to rust underneath its
oxidized and scratched Sea Blue paint is one prime example.  However, I will
stand my ground and insist that the color is different on a bus.  Too much
so (to my eye) to be due to volume, light, and angle.  Could there be a
difference?  I am thinking of the case of the bumpers of bus and truck being
the same part number but different shape....

If I could but get a verified formula.....

Thom:  Do you mean that I could get a pretty damn good paintjob by applying
more than one coat of single stage?  Does that work, or do I have to do it
all at once, while the entire bus is wet?  And just what exactly is color
sanding, anyway...?

Thanks, all....you've been invaluable!

...now to get that scorpion off my floor....

Gene
