I don't know if you have a Habor Freight store in your area, but they do have the clam shell type puller at thier store.  Thinking maybe they just don't show it in there cataloge?  The set up they have runs about $30 and will pull just about anything from steering wheels to bearings.
It's next on my goodie list, unless I find a 21 mm reamer first!
  Peace,
