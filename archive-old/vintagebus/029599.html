&gt; I lieu of this currect discussion with the freeway flyer topic, I might
&gt; suggest that anyone from now on who comes on here and asks about the freeway
&gt; flyer trans be told they will need a high horsepower engine to run it.

I would agree, but there are still variables that will work.  I didn't plan on
doing a lot of freeway driving, but wanted a little taller gears for around
town.  Even a little more cruising speed on the freeway.  A 3.88 and bug 4th
(.89) was perfect with my stock (but fairly strong) 1600SP.

I admit that fully loaded, with longboards and 2 full early bus gas tanks on the
roof, camper refer, 30 gallons of water and everything else inside, going to
Baja, it was SLOW.  It would still go 80, but 0-80 was a tick less than 8 hours!

Short Version:  Freeway fliers are great.  But like everything else, the answer
is MODERATION!
