&gt;   Following this we have used phosperic acid (You can use Naval Jelly for 
&gt;  steel from your local hardware store.) to clean really badly corroded 
&gt;  switching points.  This acid must be applied carefully with a Q-tip or 
such 
&gt;  like to just the brass contact areas as needed.  Sprayed/splashed on 
&gt;  indiscrimintly  this acid will eat up the zinc plating and any zinc pot 
metal 
&gt;  casting of switches.  After applying about 10-15 minutes or more, but 
before 
&gt;  the acid dries rinse well with water.   If you do not rinse the acid the 
&gt;  microscopic brass dust the acid creates will cause a worse corrosion flim 
&gt;  over the contact points!

Eric, Barb and List,  

I know from experience that a 30% solution of phosphoric acid works great to 
remove rust from steel.  However, my experience is that the same solution is 
not nearly as effective on copper.  My hunch is that the phosphate does not 
convert copper as well as ferric oxide.  

Another product to CONSIDER (read: I have not tried it) using for removing 
corrosion from copper would be TarnX.  I am not up on the electrochemistry of 
this product, but here is my seat of the pants speculation:  TarnX is 
formulated to remove corrosion from sterling silver, silver plate, platinum, 
copper, gold (note that brass is NOT listed).  These are all more noble 
metals on the electromotive series than say, steel (iron), zinc and aluminum. 
 However, I remember my Mom using TarnX to clean up copper pan bottoms.  The 
stuff works real fast, almost immediately.  TarnX is ONLY formulated to work 
with these much more noble metals.  My hunch is that it contains a chemical 
which acts as an anode in the presence of these noble metals.  This is not 
difficult since these metals, being more noble, really want to be cathodes in 
almost any electrochemical reaction (that's why they are so corrosion 
resistant). So the TarnX can be really effective, but ONLY with noble metals. 
 If one tried using it on stainless steel, steel, iron, aluminum, zinc, or 
God help you a magnesium engine case, the opposite would happen.  The TarnX 
would be cathodic and the less noble metal would be anodic.  The results 
would be almost instant accelerated corrosion of the less noble metal.   

One benefit of the TarnX might be that the very fast action may allow its 
application to be more controlled and applied only to the parts one wants 
treated.  

I am trying to get more information on the chemical composition and 
scientific basis for TarnX. 

Here is the manufacturer's web site:

http://www.jelmar_dot_com/pages/tarn_x.html

BTW, TarnX is made by the same folks (Jelmar) who produce Thom's favorite 
de-ruster, CLR.

I will let you know how much fun I have trying it on Magnesium!

There may be other products similar to TarnX.

A problem with the TarnX, is that it is going to leave the metal with very 
little protection against further corrosion, since you just stripped off all 
the oxygen ions which were preventing further corrosion.  I agree with Barb 
and Eric that some sort of sealer that does not impeed the electrical 
connection, such as the contact cleaner with silicon, would be a good idea.  

I need to check on how it reacts with Brass.  I would like to it the spade 
connectors and fuse box is more brass of straight copper.
