He's a top notch mechanic.

he's also an asshole of major proportions.

I don't like posting this stuff, but feel it's important to know what you
are getting into.

This is a true story, just 3 weeks ago.

He never heard of me, and doesn't think my company (Aircooled.Net Inc.) is
for real, so he badmouths it every chance he gets (as if the VW World
revolves around Orange County, CA).

 So, for &quot;fun&quot;, he placed a gay/porn-personals advertisement on the
Internet. Then, he changed the e-mail address to MINE (my company address no
less), knowing full well what would happen.

So, I receive a lot of gay personals, and gay porn (complete with very
pornographic pictures. He knows I'm not gay, and finds this extremely funny.
Hahaha.

I've never said a bad word about the man's work, but he needs to learn to
adjust his personality as well as he adjusts engines. You can take your
chances, but I'd run (not walk) from that place. I have other stories (true)
that his fuse is short, and he's a wacko'.
