For the underbelly, I would use por-15.  The zinc primer is not
intended to be a top coat, and won't last.  

You should POR-15 it, and while it's still sticky (say 20 minutes
or so) lay on a mist of grey gloss rattle-can paint.  Once the paint
and POR-15 dries, finish the job with more paint.

That will do a pretty good job of protecting it.

&gt; Do you guys think that high zinc primer is
&gt; a) better than por-15
&gt; b) equal to por-15 or
&gt; c) not as good as por-15
&gt; when it comes to protecting the bottom of a bus in a norther climate?
