    I used em on the 70 westy I sold. But I did all the body work first and 
then prepped it by removing anything that they might have to tape or spray 
over. Used a stock $199 color (green) left instructions not to paint the 
poptop. Not a multi thousand dollar job for sure, but much better than 
expected. Got charged for large vehicle and change of color came to around 
$300. I figured that all these guys do is spray all day long and have it down 
to a science. I'd do it again for a daily driver. They even had it done 
before they said they would.
