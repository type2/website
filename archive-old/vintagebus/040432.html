I recently wrote asking about the different types or models of busses.  My new dillema is trying to figure out what my new bus is.  We can't seem to find a chassis number or an engine number.  The vin numbers have also been long since removed.  Any suggestions??  [ It's a '66 that has 3 windows after the drivers window.  It also has a 1500 engine, but I'm pretty sure it's been rebuilt, hence the missing engine number.]

Also this may be a long shot, but when I was going through the box of stuff that came with the bus [books and such] I found an old S.O.T.O newsletter from May of '93.  I'm pretty sure it's from 2 owners ago.  It was addressed to David Conrad.  Maybe you know him, Maybe I'm crazy......
