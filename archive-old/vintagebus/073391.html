Subject: Re: [VB] Oil cooler question

&gt; 71 Westy, stock 1600 DP. Dog-house style oil cooler, right? Well here's
my question: On the front of the&quot;doghouse&quot; compartment tin, there is a
little &quot;Scoop&quot; for lack of a better word. It faces the front of the bus
and kinda looks like a tiny range or stove hood, If your hand was small
enough you could reach up there and touch the oil cooler, obviuosly
created for the flow of air. But my question is: Does cool air flow INTO
this scoop to cool the oil cooler, or does hot air flow OUT OF this scoop
after it has already passed throu the oil cooler.  Another way to look at
this question is &quot;Where does cooling air come from right
&gt; before it hits the oil cooler??

The air comes from inside the fan shroud.  The purpose of the doghouse tin
and all the parts attached it to direct the air through the front tin and
out of the engine compartment so that it does not get recirculated.
