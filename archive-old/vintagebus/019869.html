Subject: Water in vents?

I am restoring my '67 Sundial camper. It was based on a '67 Panel. The 
vents at the rear sides, near the roof, seem to have been allowing water 
to enter the backside of the cabinets. Is there some feature (part or 
device) that would prevent this from happening. I do not want to remove 
the vents as that would be deviating from stock. Any advice?

Thanks,

-Rocky
