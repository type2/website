Thom, since I inferred that you were referncing your
latest post to my case that was sold some months ago,
I felt I should respond. I find it an interesting
coincidence that the buyer of that case, who slandered
my name up and down and even broke ebay rules and
privacy laws in doing so, claims that another item,
one from well-known Rich Kimball (ovals Only) is
&quot;Junk&quot; also. Funny in that both items were somewhat
pricey (above $300), and that the buyer then had some
remorse over his purchase. Rather than discuss the
situation civilly, the buyer quickly places a neg.
feedback, in this case claiming that the Kimballs are
&quot;Crooks&quot;. Remember that there are always two sides to
a story, and this story definitely has that. So follow
the most simplest of rules, 1) read the auction
description thoroughly BEFORE bidding 2) Ask ANY
questions BEFORE bidding 3) if you don't feel safe
with the item description...don't feel compelled to
bid. And Thom, you have passed your qualifications to
be an official deputy Ebay sherriff. Keep up the good
policing ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Someone has an &quot;nos&quot; 36hp case on ebay right now,
yet it has the
oil filler thingy attached (the metal part that screws
on).  That seems 
highly irregular to me.  I recall another &quot;NOS&quot;
cosmolene coated case a 
while back that turned out to be junk.  Seller hasn't
responded yet.
