actually mid year 1960 was when they dropped the rear truck 
&gt; only bumper 
&gt; concept.  Of course there is the stamped rear truck bumper, 
&gt; then the ever so 
&gt; rare one 1/2 year slash rear truck bumper, I've seen two!!!!  
&gt;  Neither on a 
&gt; truck.  :)

Hi list,
Dunno if this porves anything but when I tried to fit a bus(ie non truck) to
my '60(built dec '59) dcab it would not fit due to the truck corners being
too 'sharp'. I had to grind the corners of the bumper out a little to fit
the bumper up.

Later 

Michael
