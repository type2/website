&lt;&lt; I found a pair of Hand Brake Cable (looks like the part # is 113.609.721A,
 3140mm length).  I was told that somebody used it for bus.  Any experience?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi MaMaT,
If the first number of the part # is 1 then it is for the type 1 Bug and KG.
The bus cables from about 1953 on start with a 2 as in type 2 which is the bus
part designation.  The bus does use a lot of type 1 parts mechanically, but
cables would be alot longer and thusly require a different part from the type
1s.  Plus the shortest brake cable we were able to find in our VW type 2 shop
parts book is 3168mm long.
