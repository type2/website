A discussion with another bus owner at work about Splitty Westies this week
brought up the fact that we both see quite a few advantages to having the
Split Window Bus's opening side doors, over the Baywindow's sliding door,
especially for a camper.

I've been avidly devouring everything I can find on the net about buses
(Split and Bay), but I've never seen any pics of Bay prototypes, or special
models, with the Split's opening doors, did any ever exist, or does anyone
know of Bay's being converted to the Split's doors? Inquiring minds would
love to know, it'd make an interesting and handy Camper mod.

Also, as some know, I'm desperately chasing a double cab ute (pickup) at the
moment, and the Split door discussion raised another point for me, is the
rear door on a Double Cab, the &quot;front&quot; door leaf of a Split Window's Bus
doors? The dimensions and window certainly LOOK the same, and I've seen a
lot of early Double Cabs without the indentation for the front door's door
handle. I can actually claim a non-trivial point on this one, Double Cabs
are REALLY rare in Australia ( where I am ), so WHEN I manage to get one, if
rust or accidents required the rear door be replaced at some stage, it would
be extremely hard to find a &quot;proper&quot; replacement. In such an unfortunate
occurrence, it would be nice to know that I could acquire a door from a
wrecked Split Window ( Wrecked Splitties are tragic too, but there's more of
them around than DCs ).

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,

Neale
