Subject: Re: [VB] Retorquing Heads

There is a tool available to install these studs w/o
removing the head.  It's a tapped cylinder with a bolt
in one end and a hex on the outside.  You put it on
the stud, tighten the bolt to lock the stud, insert it
using the outer hex, then unlock it by backing out the
bolt.  Works well; could be manufactured easily.

&gt; You can get studs that are self threading on one
&gt; end, that go into the case.  
&gt; they are kinda pointy with large non machine
&gt; threads.  these you can double 
&gt; nut the outer end and thread them in.   Which
&gt; probably means taking the head 
&gt; off.
