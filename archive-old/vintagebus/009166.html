Eric &amp; Barb:

&gt; The problem is that it is too easy to just load a bus due to all that
lovely
&gt; room in the cargo area.  In example lets say someone has a non-walk
through
&gt; delux bus with full length middle seat.  Result is that one can easily
load 9
&gt; people inside for a ride, and this does not include possible luggage or
tools
&gt; on board.  Now let us say that the average wieght of each person on board
is
&gt; 150 Lbs., which results in a cargo wieght of (9 x 150 Lbs.) 1350 Lbs.!
&gt; Interesting that this figure is over double of the official 600 Lbs. cargo
&gt; wieght limit of the bug!

Perhaps, but we have seen fully loaded Buses show up at VW shows and swap
meets equiped with our lowering kits and they seemed to be working fine. No
Bearing problems reported. The Bug rear wheel bearings are very durable.
People have been using swing axle Bugs off road for decades and the bearings
seem to live a long time. The transmission is usually what will give out
first in a high strees or off road situation.
You might also take a look at how small the front wheel bearings are
compared to the rear.

&gt; Okay if one has to lower thier bus we would highly recommend against the
&gt; above first option.  The problem with type 3 drums is that they are too
weak
&gt; for the wieght of the bus, and doublely so if one lowers the rear axle
till
&gt; the brake drums normally ride in a bottom tilted outward more than the
tops
&gt; attitude.  We found this out from a type 3 freak years ago.  The rear
drums
&gt; of the heavily lowered type 3s crack around the hub area of the brake
drums,
&gt; and mind you that these guys never carried any kind of a load!  Just take
a
&gt; good look at a type 3 &amp; 2 drum, and see the differance in strength in
design,
&gt; and extra thickness of metal.

Our kit is designed to keep the rear wheels straight and not with a
posititive or negative camber (when installed correctly).
As for the drums, we have not heard of anybody cracking type 3 drums used on
a Bus. If there is any concern about this, then the modified 1963 and
earlier Bus drums might be the better choice (although these are getting
hard to find).

As for reduction boxes, these made their first appearance on the Kubelwagen
alond with special Kubel-only front spindles for additional ground
clearance. A few years later, reduction boxes were used for the Bus for
ground clearance and to allow the tiny 25hp engine to push it along with
heavy loads. The final appearance of reduction boxes was on the 1971 and
1972 Thing (not sold in the U.S. for those years).

Thank You!
