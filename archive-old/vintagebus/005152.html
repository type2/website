Jim obviously wants to sell this bus, and any listee would obviously love to
have it! Passing it around would never really work(as everyone already
knows). I like the raffle idea. Jim don't get an attitude; I'm serious! This
is a bitchin bus that needs to stay in the states. Hell I'd pay $25 for a
chance at it in a heartbeat! I'd pay $25 just to see it stay in the states!
It would help out a listee, and make another listee unbelievably happy.
Think about it seriously folks!
