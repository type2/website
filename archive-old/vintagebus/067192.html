Tom, others too:

Amen Tom,

My heart aches, I wanted to help Rustybus soo baad.  But it is 3 1/2 hours
away, up and over Soldier Summit, which got a foot of snow yesterday and the
day before, and what could I do?  I have a tow dolly and an ancient 200k+
Chevy S-10 truck.  Prettty helpless.

So near, yet so phar.  Burmuda Triangle ain't our only reputation.  BUT,
at least he broke down in God's Country.  For everyone's benefit, God's
Country is that supposedly worthless land from Arches NP (Moab) east, to
the Colorado border . . . God does not live in CO.  . . . south to the AZ
border . . . God does not live in AZ, west to St. George, including the
Virgin River Gorge . . . you guessed it, God does not live in NV, and then
north to Cedar City and Zion NP.  Thence eastward to Arches.  Ahh, God's
country, but hard on a broken down splittie.  I doubt if there has EVER
been a Volks repair shop in that blessed, sacred land.  Virtually 99.9% of
the land contained therein is BLM, NFS or NP controlled.

Hey, it's Phriday!

Best, esp to Rustybus
