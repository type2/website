It's all over and we did it again, bus not without the help of all the true
bus enthusiast that made it to BBB IV.After our final talley we are able to
donate $2500.00 to Arizonas Home for Abused  children, i guess it's amazing
how much money can be raised by a bunch of bus people who use there buses
for what they are intended DRIVING, USEING and ENJOYING. 

We have already started planning next years event and are allready excited
on getting us all together again for 3 days of fun and frolic. So until next
year enjoy, i'm sure i'll see a lot of you at other shows this year with my
next being KELLY PARK, again thanks very much and the kids THANK-YOU even
more.

ps. Look for an article this JUNE in the rebirth of VW CLASSICS magazine,
they spent all three days out at BBB IV and learned a lot about what the VW
BUS crowd is really about,
Trailer Queens are just that, and buses are made to be used, just ask the
175 or so that made BBB IV.

pss. go to www.oldvolks_dot_com and click on BBB IV and check out all the listys
that made it!

Ronnie

go for it no quarter, we'll see you next year
