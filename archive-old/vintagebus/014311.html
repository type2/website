Regarding my last message..

Sorry, I confused myself; I was mixing up my research into
*reproing* and *repairing* bumpers.

I was quoted ~$800 to make a die to straighten the flat section of
a ribbed bumper - a die 6&quot; wide or so which could be used on a small
press - 20 tons would be MORE  than enough!  As thin as these things
are, vice-grips would probably be enough.

This is for Ribbed Bumpers; late-model bumpers are heavier, so
would take a bit more juice.
