Good Evening All,

Thought I would exit lurking mode and finally post a question; been
reading the digest for about six months.  I'm about halfway through the
restoration/ customization of a 1966 DeLuxe.  I was fortunate to find a
guy here in Indianapolis who will help me with the head liner
installation, but I want to  prepare the inside as much as possible
before we start.  At the back of the bus where the rag top resides there
are about fourteen what I call nut housings.  They are little boxes spot
welded to the underside if the roof and they are designed to hold a nut
securley in place while the sliding rag top is reinstalled.  Problem is,
about half of them or gone due to rust or they are busted.  Are these
parts available, or do I need to fabricate and install them ?  If they
are available, anyone know where I can buy them?

Thanks in advance

John
