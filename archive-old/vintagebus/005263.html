got pictures of another 66 hardtop deluxe, not to bad and a walkthrough,
the price is right am going to get it sunday (tow vehical permitting)

then! no sooner do i make the deal on it, i get a local phone call,
interested in buying a split window bus, i said were is it, he says
in havasu, i say; what is it; he says a 66 kombi, i say; another bus
in havasu, i thought vwhoward, the rest of LBB and i knew every
bus in town, but alas, another out of the woodwork.
So i went to look at it and it was a standerd walkthrough with these
way cool (puck) buckets in it, but the stock seats were in the back, the
whole inside was full of VW junk, was getting dark so i couldn't tell
all that was there, the bus was lowered ( right on) with a wolfgang rear kit
and it looked like missing leafs in the front, it had a set of jealosy
windows in
it, also an extra set of pop outs besides the ones installed by owner
the engine was inside the bus and the owner says it runs ( hum i think
then why is it inside the bus instead of IN the bus???), but i'll go check
it out
in the daylight and if worth it buy it, (anybody looking for a lowered 66 in
primer,
2 tone yet) just let me know. but it did look pretty straight and rust
free!!!!

back this weekend
