Hey everybody,

I've been trying to get my '62 standard on the road and I've hit a snag,
after doing a tune up: valves, points, timing, carb adjustment all per Muir
with new parts, the bus was still running really  rich (black smoke, black
plugs) I
figured the carb could use a rebuild so I bought a kit and rebuilt the carb
following
the instructions in HVW Nov, '98. Put it all back together- same problem--
rechecked valves, points, timing. No dice. So now I'm figuring I might as
well replace the carb so I know it's not the problem. I can't find a PICT
28,
but the guy at the local VW FLAPS says I can stick a PICT 30 on there and
disconnect the 12v choke; to the tune of 140.00. I really want to get my bus
on
the road so I'm willing to part with the dinero, but I want to be sure this
is really
the best thing to do; any ideas?

I have been trying to access the archives but it appears that they are
unavailable...
