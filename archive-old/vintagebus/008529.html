&gt; Ya, the trim strip covers the edge of the linoleum, not where the lock
bars
&gt; go in.   it is a little inboard from there.   THink about it, if the strip
&gt; was that far towards the doors, it would actually make it harder to close
the
&gt; doors, as it would be in the door frame area.
&gt;
&gt; but I have the impression that the bay strip was just the same as the late
&gt; splitty stuff, just a tad shorter.  In fact I got some out of a junkyard,
but
&gt; found it was shorter compared to a splitty one, and it was the same stuff.
I
&gt; guess that is narrower, if you are talking the width of the door way.

I went back to the wrecking yard and got the trim strip from the 70 Westy.
Compared it to my 77 Westy strip....totally different!
So I measured both of them&quot;
77 = 7/8'' wide, 3/8'' tall, 45'' long.
70 = 1 1/8'' wide, 5/8'' tall, 46 3/4'' long.
Does this 70 strip sound like it may be the same as a split bus strip?  [My
67 EZ camper has a smooth strip on it, cheap looking...]
