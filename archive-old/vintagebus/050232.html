&lt;&lt; I have a 66 Crew cab and was wondering if there is any way to install roll
 down windows versus the stock slide back windows. &gt;&gt;

How about unbolting the window frames &amp; just pulling them out. Kind of a
cool way to cruise around during the nice months. (At least out here in
nice dry West Texas!)
