Subject: Re: [VB] shifter spins..why?

They just do that.  I suppose of you were *really* bothered, you
could engineer something.

It's one of those things that you don't notice until you mess with it, eh?

&gt; I ordered a shift extension and put that bad boy on, it was great until I

&gt; way to get the shifter to keep from spinning???
