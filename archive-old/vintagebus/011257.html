sorry guess i forgot to say its in Pensacola Florida.


was a panel van but camper america hacked 3 windows on one side 2 on the
passanger side. done back in 66. now it has a 68 westy interior.  all seats
recovered.  interior looks great. all new brakes. new alternator.  rebuilt
1200cc motor.  runs and drives and stops and looks great.  perfect daily
driver or car to restore.  like i said it doesn't look that bad now.  e-mail
me for a picture or look at http://members.aol_dot_com/SLOWvwBUS/Author.html 
but it does have the rare SWIVEL DRIVER SEAT.  nice option. easier to get your
phat ass out. so it is a walk-thru. no rust in rockers. only rust is on the
roof in the drip rail.  its white over mint green. 
i'm asking 4000.
