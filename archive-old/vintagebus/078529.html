...

&gt;
&gt;On another topic, does anyone know of a software program that a consumer could
&gt;afford and load and use on a PC (Windows XP system) that could be used to
&gt;inventory VW Bus parts similar to the way VW does (VW part numbering system,
&gt;description, applications, etc.
&gt;Bill Bowman


while i used the mac version (on an SE, no less!), microserf excel 
did the trick for me; when i acquired my late, lamented stash in 98, 
i inventoried EVRYTHING, new or used, that had a part number, and a 
pile that didn't!
i would  put in the part # and then look up the 
description/application online,  - or conversely, type in a 
description and then look in the parts manuals for the #.  took me 2 
months, and i never did get to ALL of it (it did fill three 21-ft 
trucks, after all), but was fun and educational. the frustrating part 
came when my vw buddy would root thru boxes and take things without 
telling me, so i could delete it; then i'd go looking for a part that 
i SHOULD have, but didn't.



when i return to the home computer later this month, i could send you 
any files i might have left..........

as for affordability... my wife got a microsoft office cd  (has 
excel) from her college bookstore for like $10, students only; local 
college kids might be able to get one for you. i'm pretty sure ebarf, 
in cooperation with the microSSoft stormtroopers, pulls any auctions 
for their software, so prolly no luck there.
