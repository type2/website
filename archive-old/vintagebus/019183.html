All of the harnesses come from Bob _at_ Wiring Works; contact information
is on my wiring diagram page: http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring

&gt; I believe you can actually order from wiring works although I haven't as 
&gt; yet.  However, when I did contact them about 1-year ago the price for my 62 
&gt; deluxe was better than I could get from other outfits... who, as Frankie 
&gt; says, probably get them from there.
