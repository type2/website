 So anyway, here is my serious, non-judgemental
 question:  Is the bus in the following ad REALLY
 worth $1500, even if someone is willing to pay that??
 Heres the ad:

 I honestly am not trying to say the seller is asking
 too much or that it is out of line, I really want to
 know if anyone would ever give $1500 for this bus.

I do not think there is $500 worth of parts on it!

And it is an early 64, it has ice pick door handles.
