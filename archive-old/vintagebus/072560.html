Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

I'm just a shopper. I haven't purchased a new case yet I don't know the

receiving a good one :) Craig K  vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org  does. ( Less than
slim:)

These aluminum cases look like a Frankenstein but I know several people
running them.
Are there more than one manufacturer?
