All,
Some mechanical mate of mine suggested that it might be possible to get an
engineering firm to modify my reduction boxes by milling the case and
replacing the gears with 2 the same size give a 1:1 redux box W/O any height
loss etc. Has this been done? Is there any reason why not? Any info much
appreciated.
