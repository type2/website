Hopefully you have *2* big nuts, or the brake drums will fall off...

The last time I sold a drum-to-drum big-nut, which was back in 93 or
so, I got $250.  That tranny is still rollin' to this day.  You can
get a new nose cone, with an improved shaft seal, for ~$40  

I've seen just the boxes go for $100; Wolfgang gets $150 *per side*
for small-nut boxes.

Then again, it's only worth what someone will pay.  If it's a choice
between $100 and it sitting in the corner of your garage for the rest
of your natural life, maybe the $100 don't look too bad, ya know?

&gt; I have an extra big nut tranny layin' around and need cash so I thought
&gt; I'd sell it.  A guy offered me $100 but I thought that sounded a little
&gt; cheap.  BTW, it's missing the nose cone.  So how much is a good big nut
&gt; worth?
