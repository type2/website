Depends on the bus (i.e., how many windows, what interior, all that
rot).  I've seen figures anywhere from 1,100 to 1,300 kilograms, which
roughly translates to 2400-2800 pounds.  The most common value I've
seen is 1,150 kilograms (minimal number of windows for a non-panel, no
seats in the back).  Look for numbers resembling the kilogram values
I've given here on the id plate.  Can't remember what suffix they use,
but it's probably Kg.
