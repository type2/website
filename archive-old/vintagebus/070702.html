Subject: neighbors suck/65 project bus FOR SALE/trade eugene OR

one neighbor turns in another neighbor for filling in a ditch. that neighbor
in retaliation turns in everyone on the street who has anything that doesn't
meet &quot;code&quot;. I get a letter today saying 7 days from yesterday I gotta have
three less buses or make them legal, move all the wood, move the canopies,
trailors, car parts, etc. etc. Long story short I've got a long list of fix
it's and not much time. I need to sell a bus. I did manage to beg 20 days
instead of the 7 but thats 20 days from yesterday.

The bus:
It's a 65 standard bench seat, originally white over blue it's now in brown
primer.  Solid front floors and battery tray(in an oregon bus!) some bondo
in the rockers and a little on the nose. Never hit hard, straight down the
sides, nice corners, wheel wells never cut. The dash was hacked for a radio
but it comes with a replacement dash with a perfect radio hole from another
bus. The motor got new points, condenser, cap, rotor, and I think plugs a
year or so ago and was made to run and idle, it hasn't been run since. It'll
need brakes. Tires have good tread but they're old. 15 inch beetle wheels.
Front seats are usable, no rears but it does have the bracketry for a fold
down bed back there. you supply the plywood and foam. Comes with all the
glass but the pop outs and rear hatch glass are out at the moment. good
windshields. Asking $900/offers Trade for smaller stuff I can hide or part
trade for labor making one of the other buses legal.
