Subject: Re: [VB] chain saw blade oil undercoating

&gt; Last fall I jacked up my bus and added 4L w/ a paintbrush.  I tried
hitting
&gt; all possible area under the bus, and also in between the doors &amp; wheel
wells.
&gt; It went on extremely easily and the big jug provideed enough  to give a
little
&gt; shot to every nookadn cranny imageinable.
&gt;
&gt; After a couple days it changed colour and you can see the rust protection
&gt; soaking in.  Now, 4 months later, I am certain this will slow or stop rust
&gt; from growing on the key areas, and I would strongly recommend this method.

Yeah that seems like a good way to go.  I liked the schutz gun as I could
blow it into places - but I might try the paint brush method next year.
Maybe - paintbrush it everywhere one day and they shoot it into places with
the shutz gun the next.

So where are you Shawn?  Are you on the Bugpack group?
