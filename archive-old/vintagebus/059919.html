Subject: Gas Cap Question

Hi, Volks!

A local shop posits that I should be using a pressurized gas cap on my '67
bus' gas tank. In fact, last time I had it in the shop, I got it back with
my old gas cap gone and a pressurized one in place, no charge. A nice
gesture, to be sure, but I'm wondering.

Now, I realize newer cars use pressurized gas caps (some of my friends
actually drive new cars!), but, given the state of technology on a '67 VW
bus, I was under the impression that its gas system should use an
un-pressurized gas cap.

Does it matter?

I have yet to replace the original gas tank, unfortunately, with one that
isn't 36 years old and of dubious itegrity. I say &quot;dubious&quot; because it
hasn't given me grief until now -- with the pressurized cap. The bus is fine
when the tank is full, but when it's down to the less than quarter-full
mark, and it's sitting in a parking lot all day in 93 degrees, it tends to
greet me with a big, unwanted puddle of gas on the ground, and getting the
gas cap off the filler neck is almost impossible without a vice-like grip.

Unnerving, to say the least.

Thanks for any and all input.

Marz
