It's difficult to do unless you have documentation pointing you in
the right direction.  Cal DMV won't divulge information like that, due
to stalkers hunting people down using their car plate numbers and then
killing them.

The best way to do it is to work back the chain; talk to the guy you bought
it from, do some social engineering to find out who he bought it from,
then look him up, etc, etc.  

If you bought the car from one of the horse trader types, you may be outta
luck.

On my '56, I found out thru DMV, because I had to chase down a title for it.
I ended up talking on the phone with the lady who'd owned it for years,
and she was *up* there age-wise.  She'd drove it until it dropped, then
sold it to a tenant at the apartment building she managed.  He didn't do
much with the car, then up and died, so it sat at the apartment building
for years.  One of the horse trader types found it, bought it, and then
it was passed between different traders like a drunk sorority girl until
I bought it and fixed it up.

On the '60, I was lucky enuf to buy it, oops, I mean get it for free, from 
the original owner's grandson.
