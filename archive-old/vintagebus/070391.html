Subject: Re: [VB] 30 PICT 1 - vs 28 PICT 1

the choke and the cutoff switch need power.   Run a black wire from the hot 
side of the coil (15) to the carb.  Black is for hot with ignition on.  the 
wire bringing power to the coil with ignition on should be black.

If you don't have power to the 28 pict's choke, how do you know the element 
is broken?
yes, the 28 pict and 30 pict use the same choke element.  check it to make 
sure it is the same voltage as your bus.

 The coil dealy in the automatic choke is broken on my 28 PICT - could I just
 pull that out and put the automatic choke coil dealy in the 28 from the 30?
 
 My 28 PICT never did have power going to it and I see that the 30 PICT 1 has
 two places for power - whoa - from where should the power come for the 30 
PICT
 - and why 2? &gt;&gt;
