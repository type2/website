Subject: Eureka!! engine running, no leaks

Well, thanks so much to everybody who replied, sometimes I don't know what I'd
do without all the kind people on this list.

I took the motor back out of the bus, tore it back apart.  It actually looked
like mebbe the oil cooler was the problem, but I didn't want to do it again
so I did the RTV on the cylinders thing.  I may have tightened down the oil
cooler too much ?? but anyway, it's up and running now and not leaking.  At
least no more than expected ;-)  

I don't have any way to start it out of the bus, so I just had to go for it.
 I think everything's ok now tho.

Happy bussin' to y'all,
Diana
