&lt;&lt; amazing thing called shade, I would like to have some. &gt;&gt;

Mike,

    The later split Westy's had a clamp-on affair for the tent attachment, 
which allowed a bead to slide into it.  This bracket is available from any 
good awning/tent manufacturer.  For my '66 Westy, I had the place make me an 
8' x 8' awning, bought a couple poles from them, and staked the corners.  I 
found a center pole w/ a padded top was a good idea to hold the awning off 
your head and shed water.  I made a lot of friends at Jerome the first year I 
had it on a rainy Friday night - it was the only rain proof structure there!

Good luck,

JP
