Hi Ivan,
Oh boy!  If you are a machinist and have machinist measuring tools you might 
just be able to fix repair a split case tranny, but not without a VW workshop 
manual!  You could use either a bug (53-60) or bus (53-58) workshop manual 
for split case trannies.  The center section in either split or tunnel case 
tranny is the hardest part of the VW to rebuild properly.  Niether has part 
numbers on many of the parts themselfs, so are easily mixed up with outer 
simular parts.  Plus VW made many new and improved tranny parts that could 
not be mixed with other earlier parts and the lack of part numbers on the 
tranny parts themselfs really make this a near impossible situation for the 
amatuer tranny rebuilder.
  If this is going to be a daily driver and not a stocker show VW you really 
should consider getting a rebuilt tunnel tranny center section from a 
reliable shop like Rancho or some other place with later higher geared stock 
or freeway flier gearing.  This is especially true if you wish to do freeway 
driving over 50 MPH cruising speed the split case tranny is really geared 
for.   Eric&amp;Barb
