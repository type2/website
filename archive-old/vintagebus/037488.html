Ive seen a few logoed shop pickup trucks.
Usually just a quick exterior respray.
In the early days, you could order the bus in primer.
Not sure if they kept this up through the 60ies.
Im sure VW would &quot;jump through hoops&quot; to sell you a shop truck though.

For instance, if a panel was delivered in Dove Blue, would they have
just painted the outside, or was it common for them to re-paint the
inside as well?   I've seen very few original logo'd panels in person.
One that I can recall is dove blue on the inside and yellow on the outside.
