&lt;&lt; Here's a tricky electrical puzzle.  I just exchanged my turn-indicator 
switch 
 for a used one that seems to work.  Also took the fuse box and switches out 
 to check wiring, and remove the paint a previous owner had sprayed over the 
 wires, which made them hard to identify.  Now everything's back together and 
 working, with one exception.  When I start the engine, the red (generator) 
 lite comes on, and stays on till I turn on the headlites.  Then it goes out. 
 
 The dimmer switch doesn't work, and I seem to be stuck on hi-beams.  Does 
 anyone have any ideas?  --John Tomerlin

sounds like you got some wires hooked up wrong.  Print out a copy of the 
wiring diagram for your year bus off Thom's webpage, and make sure all is 
hooked up right.
I bet you somehow crossed the gen light and the dash light wires somehow.  

just be methodical.  It is all colour coded, and the wiring diagram shows 
which terminal on the switch gets which colour wire to it, like it'll show a 
15 by the black wire, meaning the black wire plugs into the connection at 15, 
a 30 by the red wire, so dont plug the red wire to 57a on the headlight 
switch, plug it into the 30.

BTW, what year is your bus, the dimmer switch is totally different on 66/67 
than on earlier buses
