Subject: Looking for Butterball..

I know this sounds weird, but last Sunday at a Porsche show I bought some
slash rear bumpers from a guy named &quot;Butterball&quot;(good price too).  I need to
pick them up but have lost his number.  Anybody in the LA &quot;scene&quot; know this
guy?  I recognized him, but not sure from where.

P-mail me if you know him, his number or email or can help me get in touch.
BTW I asked him why he was not at the OCTO show, and he said because &quot;they&quot;
don't like me...hmmm.

That show was pretty good for VW stuff that the Porsche guys had no use for.
How about a nice unscratched set of original logo'd front glass for $30 and I
found a cool Matra drum puller for $20.  I love it when people look down on
the VW.  Pays to look where others are not.

TIA.

Steve
