Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

Sean,

&gt;My guess is that they were put there at a later &gt;point.

Just seems strange to spend the time to make mounting points for no reason. I wonder if the pull handles were used pre-66 on variant models like ambulances or something.

&gt;They are a lot harder to break!

I like functionality. It has been stated that the pre-66 opener-handles break off after continued use as door-closers. Don't like that. The pull handle is simple and practical.

&gt;Use whatever you want unless you're like me. I tend &gt;to be a little &quot;stock nazi-ish&quot;! 

I respect your Hun Zealotry. My bus has spent a lot of it's life getting buggered, parts and paintwise.
I allow myself a few modifications for updated fuctionality or safety, and 95% of my time/efforts are spent returning it to factory specs.

Since 6/6/03 I have but in a new trans from ronnie, replaced all the front brake hydraulics including the master cylinder, complete replacement of igntion system components for my 019.

Grommets and widgets too numerous to count. Engine seals, decklid seals, door seals, window seals, drain plug sump plate, spark plug wires, axle boots, aaaahhhhh!!!!

I have 2-speed wipers, many others have drilled thru my dash, fire extinguisher bolted thru the bulkhead.
I think some new handles and a few Clara doorpanels would be appreciated by bus at this point.

Later,

Billy
