Subject: Correct Tire Pressure

After much back and forth with National Tire and Battery, I finally have
a set of Yokohama Y356 185R14 Load Range D tires on the bus.  NTB got
them in when they said they would, but they developed amnesia when if
came to the topic of balancing the wheels.  Despite an in depth
conversation with the manager about the wide five bolt pattern, he said
he had the necessary adapter, when it came time to mount the tires, they
insisted that they couldn't balance them.  The manager said he didn't
remember dicussing balancing the tires.  When they realized I wasn't
going away, they found another tire shop that could balance the tires
and had an employee take them out to be balanced.

Question - NTB mounted the tires with 35 psi, the side wall states a
load rating of 1850 pounds at 65 psi cold.  What pressure should I be
running at?

BTW, I love the tires, they look great and as everyone said, they are
significantly taller than the 185/70R14s that were on the bus before.

Thanks
