And the race is on!  This should be interesting.  Who can get to it first?  Gentlmen....start your fork lifts!

 





I found a 1955 single cab (non-barndoor) today. It is perched precariously
on top of some other junk vehicles at a junkyard in the Sacramento area. The
owner, and elderly gentleman said that whoever gets it off of the pile can
have it, in exchange for a 12-pack. He said there is another guy interested
in it too...Tom?
