Well, it isnt that great of a story, but still feels good. I had to run down 
to the town about 40 miles south of me to pick up my daughters 18th birthday 
present we had made. I was in quite a hurry because I had 3 things to attend 
to that afternoon, so I was booking down the interstate at a pretty good 
clip. I just happen to look over in the ditch and saw a dark colored bug 
sitting in the grass with both ends of the car up. He had parked it in the 
shade, so it kinda blended in, so by the time it registered, I had gone a 
football field length passed him.  I got off the road and back up all the 
way. Im in my Nissan truck with a topper, so im sure he wondered WHO this 
fool was and what kind of trouble he could bring. One good thing is, I have 
a large SEVWC club logo on the back, so as I got closer, atleast he could 
see I wasnt going to be TOO strange of a person.

He was on his way to Mobil Alabama, so it was atleast another 400 mile ride 
for him. Come to find out, his fuel pump was bad. Even though I drive a 
Nissan truck, I always carry a good bit of VW stuff just incase, plus tools, 
etc. The bad thing was, I was about in the middle of anyplace I knew where 
to get a pump from. I told him we could tow the car to the next exit about 5 
miles away and maybe there would be a mechanic place there, so off we went. 
Never towed a car on the interstate, so that was a little scary. Bad thing 
was, I always carry my bug towbar, but this was a superbeetle.

We get to the exit and there are about 5 gas stations, a large antique store 
and a nudie bar. None of the gas stations had service bays, the antique 
store didnt have any antique VW stuff and the nudie bar....well, I dont 
think what was inside would have been of any help.

I told him I had to leave, but I would get a pump from home and be back in a 
few hours after I tended to a few things. Atleast he wasnt sitting on the 
side of the interstate with nothing but cars zooming past like rockets. I 
gave him  my card and told him to call me IF anyone happend to come by with 
a pump.  I was about 2 miles from the house and on my way to meet him when 
my cell phone rang. He had called the house and got a pump from someone, so 
my daughter called me to let me know.

Now I have added a fuel pump to my parts I carry in the Nissan....just 
incase :)
