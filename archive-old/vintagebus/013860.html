Subject: [VB] Early vs Late 67 Busses/Westfalias

It appears that more than likely one of our main
adminmen, H. Steve will be getting that 67 he talked
about.  From the pictures and vin it appears to be
very early 67, care to confirm this for us Dave E. 
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus/
I have a 67 also but it is in the last 20% of
production ie: DC, Back up lights etc.
I will more than likely help H. Steve store this bus
in my yard, I have a pretty hip wife (Thanks
Melanie!).  So I will hopefully create a Web page with
both vans indicating the subtle difference etc between
the two. Here is a question I really want answered
from the Stock VW Nazi's out there.
My late 67 came w/68-71 cabinet handles not the really
nice more plastic than rubber type handles, are these
stock? If so I have 3 very nice 65 through early 67
cabinet handles I would trade for the latter. Also I
have these split items I would like to trade
1 very nice, non overrider front chrome bumper (Slash)
1 very nice, non overrider rear bumper (Slash)
1 nice pre 67 radio block off plate
1 66 ashtray

If I get those stupid handles, and a rear late 65-67
rounded rear bumper w/overiders I will have everything
I need minus tent and rack for my 67.  That way I
won't be as envious of H. Steve's very complete bus. 
Come on someone wants to work a trade.  Also I would
sell the blockoff plate and ash tray, prefer trade.
Additionally I still have a relatively complet 68 that
is being parted out. FOR CHEAP need to make room for
H's ride. 

Thanks,
Patrick Flynn
