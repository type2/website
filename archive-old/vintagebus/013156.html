Message-Id: &lt;199906071545.IAA26952_at_smtp04.primenet_dot_com&gt;

The www vintagebus recent messages archive always substitutes the last
character preceding the &quot;At&quot; sign with a dash. This makes it a PITA to send
email from this source. My digests still arrive about a day or two late~ so
I have been relying on the WWW site. Any techno geeks know why the dash
occurs? Could it be an abusive childhood? Violent past life? Failure to
avoid inhailing in the 60's? What gives?

If you are either &lt;jmbcoin-_at_jmbcoinc_dot_com&gt; or guessing
&lt;jmbcoinb_at_jmbcoinc_dot_com&gt; please pmail me prior to Thursday. Irvine Handwash
