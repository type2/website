 &gt;THe later 60s parts list shows m164 as sliding door for deluxes, which 
 &gt;option was not ( i belive ) offered in 58.  
 
 The Doliwa book I have says:
 
 M 164, Schiebetuer, Blinkleuchten vorn, bis 1/60, 241, 244
        (Sliding door, front turn signals, until 1/60)
 
 Don't know if it helps but it's a piece o' data...

but the sliding door was not offered until the 63 model year.  And what does 
that have to do with liscence light lens?

the front turn signals would, though, being N american spec.  if 164 is a 
spec code, that would fit with the notes at the liscence plate lights, about 
us spec.   Having turn signals instead of semaphores would fit with that.

hm- maybe I'll brave that 164 M code search again
