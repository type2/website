 &lt;&lt; Earliest bus there was dated 12/69 on the drivers side door jamb.  Would 
 that make this a 69 or early 70? &gt;&gt;
 Hi Pete,
 Ever since AUG55 VW has started the next year's model production every 
August 
 first.  So yes that would be a 1970 model.   Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;

actually I was surprised to learn that they did not consistantly start the 
model year at the same time each year,  though from the 63 years it did tend 
to be about aug 1st

1   Nov 58       bus ch 404 491, bug ch 2 150 222   beginning of 59 model year
30 sept 59       ch 514 885/  Oct 1 bug ch 2 632 801          start of 1960 
model
1   Oct  60         beginning of 61 model year
2   Oct 61          for 62 year
30 July 62          for 63 year
