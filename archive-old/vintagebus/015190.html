To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I had the same problem.  Re-wired my 65 DLX about a
year ago with all new stuff from Wolfsburg West.  The
fuse box they sent was the exact opposite of what I
had and what their wiring diagram called for.  Just
like you, I ended up working with what I had.  You
can, however, pull all the terminals out and put them
back in the correct positions.  Takes alot of time and
doesnt work any better.
