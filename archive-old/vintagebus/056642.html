hey all ,

       How many of us are going to cruise to busses and boats ? I was Just 
curious
Because I have three split window type 2's but would not want to camp in any 
of them. I have two trucks and a panel van . I think I may just drive down on 
saturday ?
Is it permissable to just show up to check out the busses ?  how many listees 
plan to attend . I was thinking of gathering names of bus fans from the Ohio 
area.
I will have my digital camera on hand to show pictures on my site 
www.ohiobusworks_dot_com .     thanks John Clancy
