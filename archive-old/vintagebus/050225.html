Subject: Bus Lowering Info Posted

I know... it's a touchy subject. But for anyone interested, I posted an
excerpt from the &quot;VW Bus Custom Handbook&quot; by Laurence Meredith that talks
about options for lowering a vintage bus. It's not &quot;super&quot; detailed, but
it's just about the only printed info I've found on the subject. The URL is:

To be honest, I'm not really a big fan of lowered buses. I do however like
to have as much info as possible availlable to me. So I posted this for
others to have access to.
