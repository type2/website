Subject: Re: Buckin' Bus!

&gt;Any advice on my gummy 34pict3?

Um, clean it out?

&gt;I don't want to rebuild the carb as of yet.

Why not?  A rebuild kit is less than $10 and the gallon can of carb
cleaner is $15 or so.  Take everything apart, knock off all the really
big nasty clumps, and toss it in the bucket.  On the side of the bucket
it says &quot;an hour&quot; but I've found &quot;overnight&quot; usually works better.  Blow
it out with compressed air when you get done and put it back together.

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/002867.html has a couple of
tips on 34-PICT-3 cleaning.

The 34-PICT-3 on my Dad's Bug sat for two years with gas in it and when
we got it there was 1/2&quot; of gum and gunk in the bottom of the float bowl.
It took two trips through Bad Berryman but it finally cleaned up and has
been running fine for 40,000+ miles.

&gt;Can I soak it w/o damaging the seals?

Nope.  It'll eat the paper gaskets and swell up the rubber o-rings to
unbelievable sizes.

&gt;I know if the gen ground on the shroud comes off it runs similar.

Have you checked the grounding strap at the nose of the transmission?
Usually if this is bad you know it because the starter barely turns
over.
