Woody,

I'm going through this right now.  As far as I know the thermo-to-flap rod
(the one that looks like a welding rod with a kink in it) is the same.  BUT
the flat metal rod/strap that connects both (left and right) flaps together
is different.  Obviously, the dog house one needs to be longer and bent out
to clear the extra wide cooler.  Also, don't forget that there is a long
spring that attaches to the rod/strap form the fan shroud (near the
cooler).  This helps the flaps retract.

Not sure about the different temp thermo's

I don't have one, but next swap you are at check out all the DH coolers.
They get left on sometimes.  That's how I found the one I have on my motor
right now.

&gt; Is the thermostat rod (the rod that connects the thermostat to the fan

&gt; the same in a doghouse shroud and a non-doghouse shroud ?
&gt; Are there different temperature range thermostats,ones that activate at
&gt; different temps.?
&gt; Anybody have a &quot;hoover bit&quot; they want to part with ?
