&gt; With all this talk about engines what is the average life expectancy of a

A _good_ rebuilt 1600 should last about the same as a new engine, but a
_good_ rebuild costs about the same as a new engine!

1776 rebuilts depend strongly on the quality of the parts used, and on how
often the owner uses the extra power continuously.  If you climb a lot of
hills in summer at WOT, not long.  If you live in Nebraska, quite a while. 

If you really want to run more power with reliability, look at a type 4
engine or other engine swap.  Otherwise, climb hills slowly and enjoy the
view!
