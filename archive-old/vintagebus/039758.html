&gt;Please kill this thread - thanks.

Thom

If I get kicked for this so be it:
DO NOT KILL THIS THREAD:
Yes it is not really bus content, but where will you read bus content if we 
lose the list?

We are the list and we are speaking out on this issue. I want to see both 
sides of this issue.

Sorry Thom, I want to know the whys and why nots of this issue. It may be a 
lame duck but I want to know more.
