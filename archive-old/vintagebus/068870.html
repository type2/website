Subject: RE: [VB] grand canyon

  The Grand Canyon is approx 200 miles from Vegas, you could head up to the
north rim if you wanted to. If I was in Vegas on a limited time frame I
would go spend time in Valley of Fire, a lot closer and absolutley
breathtaking with the Indian writtings, the colors, etc. They opened up a
new area there that looks just like the moon! Strange how land formations
can change in such an area. The fees there are on the honor system (drop
boxes for your money) at least last time I was there. Anyway it is a
beautiful area, a lot closer then the Grand Canyon and NOT as crowded as the
Grand Canyon.

ps. If you watch TV you would be familar with a lot of the areas as a lot of
movies and TV commercials are filmed there.
