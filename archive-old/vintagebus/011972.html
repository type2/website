&gt; Todd,
&gt; If you are really wanting to put a sunroof in your bus, why not get
one
&gt; from Street Beat. So everyone will know that it is not original.
When you
&gt; change stuff like this, you are changing history. Say down the road,
way down
&gt; the road, someone is going to put back what you did, and they are
going think
&gt; they had a sunroof standard or kombi when in fact they have a
hardtop with a
&gt; hole in its head! Its the same as counterfiting money, or even worse.
&gt; Mike

I don't think that there is a criminal penalty for transplanting a
sunroof onto a bus!  Fact is, any given bus could have had a sunroof
if the build order had specified it at the factory.  Swapping one on
later isn't all that nasty of a thing to do as long as it's done in a
workmanlike manner.

Now, if you represent it to a buyer as an original sunroof bus it
wouldn't be ethical.  Your karma would suffer!
