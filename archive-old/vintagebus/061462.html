Subject: anti-seize on lug nuts?

I took a wheel off three days ago. I had to stand on
the &quot;X&quot; lug wrench, bruised my shin. Put it back on
the next day. Had to take it off again the following
day and it was equally hard to remove (more shin
bruises).

Is it okay to put anti-seize on the lug nuts? With all
this recent talk of wheels falling off, I'm just
wondering.
