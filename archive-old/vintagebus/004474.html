My 57 doesn't have the hole. It does have the spot where a light would be,
but the screw holes appear to have never had a screw in them. No wire. My 59
has the plug, but no wire and no trace of screws in the light hole. The 65
doublecab that the ABC raffled last year had the plug, no wires, and no
trace of screws in either hole when we got it. If I recall correctly we
installed the switch and lights before raffling it, since they were donated.

&gt; as i brought up about a year ago, my 57 single cab doesnt even have the
hole
&gt; on the speedo pod for a switch or a plug.... what about yours kyle -does
&gt; your 57 have a hole for a plug? Im still wondering if its an early truck
&gt; thing.  If not, that would make my speedo pod ROTR or just a factory error
&gt; :) .....        Everett? frankie? list? how was/is yours?
