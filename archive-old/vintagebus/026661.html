Hi Taylor,
        One thing to keep in mind , is that not all American conversion VW.
campers were converted the year volkswagen made the bus.I have seen 59 buses
with sundial factory interiors. (Sundial I believe didn't start until 63).So
what i'm trying to say is, people sometimes brought there used buses in to
Sundial, Riviera etc. and had them converted to campers.
So don't rely heavily on the year.
                    my 2 cents,  woody
