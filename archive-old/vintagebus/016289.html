Subject: Does Anyone Know How To Make Their Own Tent
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello again,
    I am sorry that I am asking this many questions,
but have had so many questions that I could not find
on the web.  Well, does anyone know how to make their
own tent that goes out the door of the bus?  They are
so expensive to buy.  Does anyone have step by step
instructions or close to it?  I found a guy who tells
how to make an awning-Go to type2_dot_com.  Then click on
Library.  Then Click on Exterior.  It should be the
first one on the list.  It seems much cheaper than
buying one.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.

Peace,
Tim Hayes
