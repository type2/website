Dave Easterwood's right. The trany will fit.
Tomorrow morning, before you have your breakfast beer 8^), try this:
Get the trany started back in where it goes. It will eventually stop
moving forward because the reduction boxes will hit the ends of the
plates they bolt to (looks like the axles are too short). Now, shove
one of the boxes as close as you can to the position it bolts in. This
will make the other one look like it will never go where it belongs.
Go to the outside of the bus on the side where the box looks like it
won't fit. Sit down, put your foot (with a boot on it) on the spring
plate and push it toward the center of the bus. Slide the box into
position on the plate. With your other two hands, make sure the other
side doesn't slide off it's plate and shove the trany forward a little
bit too 8^). OK, let the helper do some of that stuff.

Also, make sure the bus is nice and stable on it's jackstands before
you start pushing on it. You really won't have to push very hard, but
I don't want to hear about any disasters.
