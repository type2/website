Hello List,
My post begins in 1980.  A man named John and his wife Jane(real names) were 
newly married and true free spirits.  They purchased an old VW westy and 
vowed to remain true to each other and true to their search for the open 
road and freedom.  For the next few years they traveled up and down the East 
coast, hitting music festivals and Mardi Gras'. But the years passed and the 
road grew weary. They settled down in an old farm house and drove the bus 
less and less.  In 1988 the bus threw a rod, Jane got pregnant with a little 
girl named Julia and the yuppie life set in.  A minivan replaced the VW bus 
and it got parked behind the shed away from view of friends who might not 
approve.  The only friend the bus had was Julia.  It became her playhouse as 
she got older.  No other little girls lived anywhere close so she spent a 
lot of time in the bus.  John ran an electric cord out to the bus so she 
could play her radio and have light. And the years passed on.

As a school teacher, I came to know Julia this past fall in my 5th grade 
class.  She always seemed to pay more attention to my busses than the other 
children. One day when the other kids had left she told me that she had a 
bus but it hadn't ever moved.  I explained how any bus could move if you 
fixed it.  We talked about how I bought old busses and made them move.  She 
sat for a moment and then said that I should buy her bus and make it move.  
I felt a big tear welling up and I realized that she, like myself saw busses 
as something more than machines, she saw them as friends.  And she wanted 
her friend to be alive again.

I went to see her father that evening and offered to help him fix the bus. 
He explained that he had a new baby, a new job and no time for the bus. He 
said I could have it for a song.  I towed it home, replaced the brakes and 
found another engine.  Perhaps only the people on this list understand what 
it feels like to ride in a bus that has sat for 12 years so I don't need to 
explain that.  My story ended this past week when the fifth graders had an 
overnight trip to a local science center.  I arranged for Julia and some of 
her friends to ride with me but didn't tell them I was bringing the bus.  
When I pulled up in front of the school, Julia was standing outside. I felt 
a chill when I saw her pointing at the bus.  When we were loaded up and 
pulling out, I heard her tell her friend, &quot;It's ALIVE. Mr. Smith made my bus 
alive again.&quot; I felt another chill as i realized that I now have two new 
lifetime friends, Julia the little girl and Julia the big white bus.
