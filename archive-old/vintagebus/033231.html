&lt;&lt; The hitch will fasten on via the bumper to frame bolts (I'll use an extra 
long bolt) and then I can drill a hole or 2 in the bottom of the 67's bumper 
and this will hold the hitch up.  &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
Bad idea!  All of the bus hitches we have seen or have pictures of clamped to 
the supports for the tranny cradle and/or the outer ends of the rear torsion 
tube.  There is just not enough support in the bumper to frame area.
