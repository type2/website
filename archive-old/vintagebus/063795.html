Subject: Where do I go to get info on . . .

Volks,

I POR 15'd my front interior today, also the upside of the engine tray.  A
good friend of mine helped me.  He came over to use my jack, etc. to put on a
rear sway bar on a '70 Bug, IRS.  We couldn't find and holes frame horns.
Where can I go to get tech &quot;how to&quot; info on where to drill the holes for the
pivoting clamps?  Anyone know?

Best,

Curt
