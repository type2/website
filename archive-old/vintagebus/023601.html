All I know is that it will take place on October 8th in Normal, Illinois and yes, it's like right next to Bloomington. It's about two hours drive from Chicago going south. It's gonna be on Fort Jesse Rd. Show, swap meet etc. There is a pre-BugFest campout at Yogi Bear Jellystone Park in Goodfield, IL on Saturday with bonfire. They say Fest will be from 12:00 to 4:00 PM but
who knows? It's CILVA Fest so you know it's sponsored by Central Illinois Volkswagen Association. Local DBG members going too. Check our site for more
