Subject: stuipd RGB question

I looked in the owners manuals online &amp; the Bentley but have not
found exactly what I am looking for. Found plenty of post about the
amount of fluid &amp; type of fluid to put in the tranny &amp; RGB's, but how
do you check the amount in the RGB? Sure the tranny is easy, just fill
till it is even w/ the bottom of the fill plug., but is there anyway
to check the RGB, or is it just assumed that if the tranny fluid is
the correct level, the needed oil for the RGB's make their way to the
correct level through the axle tubes.
