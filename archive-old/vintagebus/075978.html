Subject: Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

Hey you gas heater gurus out there......I have a question for you:

I have a BN-4 that recently quit working....I am dl'ing the manual from 
vintagebus_dot_com right now =)

Flick the switch on and I get nothing....no clicking from the fuel pump or 
heater firing up..no fan either..

I am correct to assume, that due to all of the safety circuits/switches on 
the heater, if no fuel reaches the glow plug...nothing else will be triggered on?

Basically...if the fuel pump has taken a dive, and no fuel reaches the 
heater, then nothing else would/should happen...correct?

From looking at the wiring diagrams, the pump should be energized 
(clicking)as soon as the switch is clicked to the on position..right?

Can the pump be pulled and bench tested with 12V on 1 terminal and ground on 
the other:? 

This is my first exposure to a gas heater, so pardon my dumbassedness =)
