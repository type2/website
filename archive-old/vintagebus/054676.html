Subject: Re: [VB] still no 3rd or 4th gear

Hey Don,

Your shift plate may be upside down.  I forget exactly what it looks like 
but remeber thinking when it was right it looked backwards to me.  When I 
first got my bus I swaped my bay shifter for a splitty one and put the plate 
on upside down and had your senerio.  Just try flipping it and see.  Easy 
job with a helper.  However by yourself with no front pushing is a bear...I 
had to jam a stick redneck style just to line the shifter ball in to the 
sloted cup thing.

Good Luck,

Eric

&gt;I'm pretty convinced the problem lies right at the shift plate.  Everything
&gt;else is tight in back.
