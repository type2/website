Subject: Re: [VB] Remove Cooling Fan

Strap gen back onto stand on engine.  Take outer gen pulley off.  Put vise 
grips or crescent wrench on inner pulley-- on the hub sticking out.   I have 
also put a big _at_ss screwdriver in the fan blades, but sometimes that bends the 
blades... what's the torque on that 36mm nut on the front of the gen?    50 ft 
lbs?   NOT an axle nut, for pete's sake.   You shouldn't have to strap it onto 
the motor, but in the real world some DPO or their mechanic prolly torqued it 
too tight and other wise you have to get a friend to stand on it while to turn 
the nut, which may tip them over.

sometimes taking the front hub off is a PITA... use two big screwdrievrs to 
pry it off.. one opposite the other, and kinda of alternative them, wiggle it 
off.   I'm guessing you're putting a new gen on, so have to swap it all over.   
use grease before installing it on the new gen.  grease is your friend.

Replace oil cooler seals if it's been too long or you don't know when it's 
last been done.  They are cheap, and at this point it's not much to unbolt.  

oh... if the inner pulley doesn't want to go back on cause of the vise grip 
gouges... don't force it.._dot_use a file to clean it to round again... or it'll be 
a real PITA to take it off to put on the other gen.

Anyone have any tips on removing the fan from the generator?  I followed the
Muir instructions:  generator on table, fan hanging over side vice grips on
shaft, turn big nut counter clockwise.
This just resulted in gouging the metal on the shaft as it turned inside the
vice grips.  Ugggg.
Any insightful tips appreciated!
Mike
