Subject: SW Heater wiring help

Hey Y'all,
I just received a Stewart Warner 12 volt gas heater
for my bus and I need some help figuring out the
wiring, can anyone help me with how to wire this
thing, here's a description of the wires that I see:
 I see a red wire with a &quot;ring&quot; connecter and a brown
wire coming out of what looks like the main electrical
attachment (looks like a little transformer).  Then
there is another wire that appears to be a ground wire
coming off of the body of the heater under the coil? 
Then there is a male end of a push-on terminal that
has no wire on it that located on the front of the
switch (I am assuming this is a switch, it hs a cable
connector on it).
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks &amp; PEACE! John Baker
