&lt;&lt;Yup.  This weekend I turned down not one, but TWO different offers of
intimate
encounters with the opposite sex, in favor of putting a new nose on the
bus.
(if the two chix decide to join forces, all bets are off!)&gt;&gt;

TOM!!!!

Get to a psychiatrist as quickly as possible. Or a physician. It could
be a LARGE MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMOUR!!! Somethin' dont sound quite right
here.

Couldnt ya get either one to inspect the shiny insides of your bus (bus
content)
