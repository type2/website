 &gt;But the &quot;big top&quot; bay window westy is wonderful for camping and long trips.
 &gt;With disk brakes, a larger and longer life engine, ball joint front
 &gt;supension and IRS rear, the bays will travel so much easier and faster.
 &gt;You can't beat that huge bed on top!!
 
  &gt;&gt;

ball joints dont make sense on a bus. icky squishy ride.    I like the king 
pins.  anyone ever put a split front beam on a 68 or 69 bay?  now THAT would 
be cool.
