Ya, I agree 100% with the Al's/Checker's/PepBoys advice being not so great.  
But I guess I was lucky.   When I was living in Santa Cruz and trying to sort 
my VW head out, I had helpful friends with usually good advice and would bug 
the guys at the VW parts store, which was a good one with knowledgable 
friendly folks who would help.  I had gone to other places, but when I was 
offered two kinds of points and asked the difference the guy said the pricier 
one was made of &quot;Xeron, from the planet Xeron&quot;, and I never went back there.  
Peter (the good parts store guy) would see me biking around town on my 
mountain bike and ask if my bus was broken down, no, i'd say, if it was I'd 
be buying parts or getting advice.   In retrospect I am surprised they were 
so helpful, cause I didn't spend a huge amount of money, none of my friends 
did either.   I think it was because they were into the VW comraderie thang.  
They didn't try to rip me off or get condescending.
