Subject: Re: [VB] Axle boots

Thanks to all for the advice. I didn't have any trouble using a hose
clamp. Luckily the previous boots  were installed with hose clamps so
I didn't have to find any. The OEM clamps would have fit if I had more
room and strength, or special tool, to compress it just a little bit
more.
