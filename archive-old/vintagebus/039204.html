Hi,

I got a hold of some gauges. VDO volt, pressure and temp. The pressure is
calibrated at 1-5 Bar and the temp up to 150 deg. C. 

I know how to convert to PSI and deg. F but am not sure of sender unit
compatibility. Does a sender designed for degs. F just read at the
equivalent deg. C ? Does the same apply to pressure in Bar ? I know that VDO
gauges in psi read up to 90 psi whereas 5 bar is 72.5 psi. Will a psi sender
register 5 bar when it reads 72.5 psi at the oil pressure relief valve? 

Hope that is clear.
Bob
