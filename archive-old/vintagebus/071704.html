Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Have thermostats changed on us?

The old style is still avaliable new, the hard part is getting them. They go
on backorder for a while when we order them, sometimes they send us the
'new' style, which we send back.

If you have good, old thermostats, hold onto them, just in case you need one
in a pinch, and don't want to wait for them to be in stock.
