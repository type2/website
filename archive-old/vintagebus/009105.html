Just as with automotive stuff, there are lots of aftermarket manufacturers
in the marine field.  Some of the aftermarket marine fittings/items are
superior to the OEM stuff, and less expensive as well.  This is especially
true in regard to outboard motor fuel fittings.  Your best bet is to go to a
West Marine or similar store and check out what's available with your
specific application in mind.  Forget all about what the part is 'supposed'
to fit, think for yourself.

Some may be skeptical about the suitability of using outboard motor stuff
for a VW fuel system.  Bear in mind that many so-called 'outboards' are V-6
and V-8 engines with displacement and HP specs similar to car and truck
engines, and require a forklift or industrial chain hoist to move them
around.

The only way to make total fuel line replacement 'dripless' is to establish
some sort of shutoff valve mounted directly to the tank outlet.  If your bus
has a functional reserve valve fitted this may do the trick, otherwise an
aftermarket valve will have to be adapted.

The latest spec. Coast Guard approved marine fuel line is pretty tough
stuff, and also expensive.  However, as others can testify, none of the US
size material seems to fit and work as well as the German metric material.
If you find a US size line that seems to fit snugly on the VW connections
and fittings, I'd strongly suggest double-clamping and maintaining a very
close watch on the system until you're assured no problems/leaks develop
with use.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm now looking at the &quot;quick disconnect&quot; fittings posited by
some people earlier in the thread.  I found an internet site for a
manufacturer of these fittings the other day and emailed them regarding
suitability on a bus, I kind of expected the answer I got which was
something like &quot;we can't answer your question 'cuz it isn't a boat
(liability)&quot;. &lt;&lt;
