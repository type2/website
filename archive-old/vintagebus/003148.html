&gt; Hey Volks
&gt;
&gt; A few weeks ago my dot_dot_com publishing employer suddenly closed down and I
&gt; found myself without a job for the first time in 10 years. So I've decided
&gt; it's time to go travelling, and live out one of my dreams.
&gt;
&gt; Some of you list oldtimers might remember a Friday questionnaire about
five
&gt; years back when Unca Joel Walker (I think) asked what everyone's dream bus
&gt; trip was.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I posted then how I'd love to drive a vintage bus from Cape to
Cairo.
&gt; So that's what I'm doing. Leaving around the end of June, I, my partner,
and
&gt; possibly another friend, will leave for Cape Town and Cape Agulhas, the
&gt; southernmost point of Africa, and then through Namibia, Botswana, Zambia,
&gt; Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. From there
&gt; we intend to make for London, where we will sell the vehicle and fly home.
&gt; We might, after Cairo, follow the African Mediterranean coastline through
&gt; Libya, Tunisia (Africa's northernmost point), Algeria and Morocco,
crossing
&gt; to Europe at Gibraltar. In fact, never mind might, I think that's what
we'll
&gt; do :-) We have given ourselves six months to complete the journey.
&gt;
&gt; A website is to follow shortly, and I'll keep the list updated on my
&gt; preparations. Also expect regular trip reports on the site, and updates to
&gt; the list.
&gt;
&gt;
