Subject: Re: [VB] jets in a 28PCI

I looked this up in Fix Your Volkswagen by Jud Purvis, 1960 edition:


&gt;So I got to looking at a 28PCI carb, and there look to be four jets.
&gt;I always thought there were two: the idle jet, and the main jet.  The
&gt;jet-like things I'm seeing are (FIF):
&gt;
&gt;- on the exterior left side, just behind the base of the float bowl, a
&gt;  13mm bolt head attached to a short tube with numbers stamped into
&gt;  the end away from the bolt head

The Main Jet



&gt;- on the exterior right side, just below the parting line for the
&gt;  top of the carb, just behind the float bowl, a flat screw-like
&gt;  object with numbers stamped into the screw head

The Pilot Jet




&gt;- suspended in the middle of the throat, a largish flat screw-like
&gt;  object with numbers stamped into the screw head

The Air Correction Jet




&gt;- using the previous one as the center of a clock, and the front of
&gt;  the carb being 12 o'clock, on the side of the throat at about 1:30 a
&gt;  smallish flat screw-like object with numbers stamped into the screw
&gt;  head

The Pilot Jet Air Bleed
