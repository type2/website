Subject: Ready, Set, Rebuild!

Well tonight officially kicked off my first rebuild.  I started out by
watching bits and pieces of the Jerry Hahn rebuild video and then I read the
Tom Wilson book for a few minutes.  I didn't get very far on the rebuild but
I wasn't trying too hard either.  I was able to get 8 dowels in the crank
and get it bolted to the flywheel for a stand.  The bearing locator pins are
in and the bearings marked so that when I put in the crank, I'll know just
how to line up the bearings so they will fall on the dowel pins.  The ring
grooves in the pistons were dirty so I cleaned them out.  The o-ring seals
are on the 6 main engine studs and 4 lifters are in place.  Looks like now I
need some plastiguage for the rod clearance.

Questions:

What's a good sealant to use on the cam plug?

I also need some rings for my pistons.  They are stamped 90.43mm on the tops
and the ring measurement (thickness) from the top down is:  .0555&quot;/1.41mm,
.0755&quot;/1.92mm, and .1575&quot;/4mm - anyone got a new set they'd like to sell me
that would match these sizes?

That's about it for tonight - thanks for reading...
