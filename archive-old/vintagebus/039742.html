Hey

I am almost done rewiring my bus.  I am wondering how to tell if I have 12 
volt wiper motor.  My wipers seem pretty slow to me.  What makes me think 
that it was not changed is that my wipers are still one speed with 3 wires 
going to the motor.  I have the stamped steel setup.  My wiper switch does 
not have the same terminal #s that the harness says that it should.   I have 
#54d blk/purple,dualtab (hot?)  #54 with domelight wire, 31b brown, and #31 
with no tab at all (not even the remenants of one).  My bus was built in Feb 
65.   My replacement harness says  53blk,  53a redblk, 31b  brown.  Is this 
a beetle switch?

My other question is Does anyone have a roofrack that they would part with?  
Is there a modern rack that will fit. It seems to me that most modern ones 
do not have long enough legs.  I need one for my  roadtrip.

thanks alot
domonic
