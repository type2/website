Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Q

I thought I had read about that being a Motorola. I
just wasn't sure because it said &quot;remanufatured by
Bosch&quot; on it. 
 From what I have heard it looks like I will look into
getting the Bosch one. Anyone need a Motorola one?
At least I know how to set the Bosch one up! 
Thanks all.

Sean
