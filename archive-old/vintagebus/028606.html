I have to agree with your criticism on SUVs entirely.  SUV= Stupid Ugly
Vehicle.  I perhaps could understand having one if you lived in a remote
place with substandard roads, but I find that my front wheel drive
daily-driver will trudge through nearly as much snow as any SUV, and there
are cars that do what SUVs can do only much more efficently.  (like a Passat
wagon with 4MOTION)

The average yuppie in the crowded urban neighborhood of Lincoln Park in
Chicago really needs a 4 wheel drive vehicle in an area where parking is a
commodity.  Only in America do you find such selfishness and waste of
resources.  No person who drives an SUV in an urban envirment could have any
regard for their fellow man or the environment.  This may sound funny coming
from a conservative Republican type like myself (as I usully protest any
form of taxation) but I strongly feel that gas is way to cheap in the US and
higher taxes should be levied to encourage more sensible, fuel efficient
vehicles.  I know that my freinds in Germany do not drive SUVS!!  I would
not mind paying $3 per gallon for gas if it meant getting some SUVs off the
road.

I know that a lot of single cabs were used in the Bundeswehr for transport
and perhaps I could mount a &quot;Racketenwurfer&quot; in the bed of my 55 SC and take
out a few SUVs on my own.  :-)  You have to admit its a beautiful thought!

This is not exactly a good argument by Mr. SUV, because he is not comparing
apples to apples.

This debate must be considered relative to the dates the vehicles were
produced.  Back in the day the bus was similar in it handling, acceleration,
and braking to other cars of the time period (I think).  Gas mileage I think
was much higher than normal, even today it is not bad gas mileage.
Maintenance and cost per mile is miniscule compared to the new cars.  Plus
think of the lack of interest charges on a financed new vehicle or the total
loss of equity in a leased vehicle, both very powerful arguments for used
cash purchased vehicles.

I am not saying that our choice of early VWs is logical in the least.  The
VWs cannot stop, crash well, accelerate, or handle.  But they have style,
cheap parts, and easy to work on... Mostly style though.

Comparing the advances in the SUV to a regular car of today is a better
comparison on how bad they are.  SUVs SUCK!!!  They cannot handle or stop
and they are not very economical.  Most people I know with SUVs get around
10-14 MPG and they paid(financed) out the butt to get these over expensive
bricks.  Granted modern society embraces these cars because they are so
rugged and 4x4 for all the non-off road adventures they see, shoot I have
not even seen one jump a curb for a right on red WTF!  Why buy a 4x4 when
you will never see off road conditions?   A good comparison would be to a
modern minivan that is much safer in crash tests, has much better fuel
economy, and is more practical for hauling normal stuff.

Society as a whole is very illogical, irrational, and emotional.  I used to
wonder why people did the things they do, but I have learned to give it up
and go my own way.  They can have their Starbucks and cell phones and shove
them up their ass!  American society is becoming more and more &quot;needy&quot; and
dependant on others instead of themselves, watch the news all it is is a
bunch of crybabies whining for more help and government protection.  The
whole thing is pitiful, but you have to play the game.  If cell phones are
so great why are there more accidents caused by using the cell phone as
compared to drunk driving... Give me a beer it is safer!  How about all this
hub-bub about raising the driving age?  Why not teach the kids how to drive
in the first place in stead, just because they are 18 and learning to drive
does not mean they can all of a sudden drive better than a 16 year old.
Shoot give the 13 year olds condoms, because they are prepared to be
parents, but hell if they can drive!  And those movies made the kids shoot
each other, sue Hollywood.  And hey it is okay if Elton John want s to blab
about gay rights, but lets condemn Dr. Laura for exercising her 1st
amendment rights, not logical or fair.  And while we are at it lets not
teach our children about gun safety or respect for them so they can learn on
TV... Oh, ban guns because parents are idiots, the police will protect us
from violent crime, right? Not!  Also credit is ruining the working classes
lives, but I will not go into that rant.

Gees, I need to get a grip.  I think there was bus content in here somewhere
