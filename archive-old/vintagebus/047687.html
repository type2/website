Thanks Andy it was a pleasure!

    Like Andy says the hub cap hand off happened today and the hub cap and 
box of stuff is down here in the southernmost US city.  we will take it and 
get a photo at the southernmost sign before it goes north.   162 miles up and 
back today.  bus started this new high idle thing when warm.  idles normal 
till good and warm then idles fast.  drives nice, runs cool.  hmm have to 
check things out tomorrow.  ideas? 

Can't wait to plan a family camping trip with Andy's family. (real good 
people). ;)

oh i almost forgot ...  who does it go to next?  Leo?
