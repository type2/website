Subject: Re: [VB] Help With Brakes Pulling Right

&lt;&lt; Gang,
 
 My 56 Kombi is pulling hard right when I have to apply the brakes and was
 looking for a little help about the issue.  I just replaced the brake pads,
 wheel cylinders, and bleed the brakes.  I also made adjustments using the
 star wheels.  However, I don't have enough driving experience with this van
 to tell if it did it before I made these adjustments. Couple of questions:
 
 1) If I don't have the brakes adjusted correctly would it pull right?  Seems
 like it would and this is where the problem is.
............

only if you had one side right and the other loose.   I adjust them so the 
wheel can't move, then back off a star arm or three, until the shoe barely rubs. 
  Stomp on the brakes a few times and readjust before lowering down.    
 ---------------------
 2) When I adjusted the brakes there was always a spot the rubbed when I spun
 the wheel around 360 degrees. 
..................
yes this is normal.   As long as it is a light rub.   The new shoes aren't 
circles, and will wear uneven at first.  This mean they wll adjust more at first.
----------------------------------------------------------
 3) I bleed the brakes, however if I still had air between the master and the
 slave would the Kombi pull because of this?  The Brake are nice and tight,
 not soft at all.  Could I have air that would cause a pull and still have
 tight brakes?
..........................
air in the lines makes the brake feel mushy, and pump up.   However, if you 
have old flex lines it can make the bus pull, if the fluid can't return on one 
side the brakes there get stuck on a bit.  
--------------------------
 
 4) The Kombi naturally steers right (out of alignment) and the steering box
 is sloppy.  Does applying the brakes just compound this effect causing the
 van to pull right or should I be more interested in finding the problem in
 the braking mechanism.
.........................
well, if the bus steers right it'll brake right.  Does it pull right because 
of brake issues?   An old brake flex hoses can make it pull.    A old bad tire 
with a tumor? I had that problem, and it was really annoying.  New tires 
fixed the steering issue.    Sloppy steering box makes loose steering, not pulling 
to one side.    

hope this helps.   Figure out where that is coming from.   You can do the 
alignment yourself with the idiot book method.  
 ...................
 Any help would be appreciated.
