Hi Alex,
Check you generator brushes to make sure they are taller than the cages they 
sit in.  Is the commutator of the generator dirty?  If so clean it with a 
cardboard emery finger nail sanding stick when the engine is running.  Clean 
and retighten all connections between the generator, regulator (regulators 
that are seperate from the generator need good contact to the body!), starter 
solinoid, battery, and all the wiring going up front through the fuse box, 
headlight switch, ignition switch and back to the starter solinoid, and coil. 
 Then take your multimeter and with it set for voltmeter check the voltage at 
the battery terminals and then check at various points of the above wiring 
system and see how much drop in voltage there is and if you can solve it.
