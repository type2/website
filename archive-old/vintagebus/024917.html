Hi,
You should be able to carfully bend them to fit against the backing plates
better.  They are supposed to rest inside of metal tabs welded to the backing
plates to hold them there.  Using wire worries us because it would mean
rubbing in a small area on the metal lines due to vibration from the road and
eventually causing hydralic brake failure.  Eric&amp;Barb
