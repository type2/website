I have Euro lights in the '55, and there really isn't any &quot;hassle&quot; with
bulb holders.  It's actually easier to change a bulb with a Euro light
than with American spec.  I have a set of NOS ones on it now, which are
actually *Mercedes* units that some ebay-vendors are pawning off as barndoor
lights.  They don't look any different than the real deal, other than
they don't have the VW logo on them.

I ran fluted lenses over sealed beams in the '56 for years with no problems.

I had never heard of this beast before, and of course would now like to find a set instead of going with fluted lenses on the '59.  Fluted lenses means bulb holders, etc. which I'm not sure I want to monkey with.  And just throwing fluted lenses over a sealed beam ain't gonna work right either.
