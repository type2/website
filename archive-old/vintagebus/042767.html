Having a 71 and a 61, i end up driving my 61 to and from work every day...
the 71 is more comfy and big, and the 61 is smaller and more unstable at
speed... but a lot more nimble in traffic. (gotta love the way the rear
wheels tend to tuck in sometimes)

Anyway i've put like 10-15k miles on my 61 since march... so to say that
it isnt for driving would be wrong...

So, to say newer busses are better for driving just isnt true.  I'd say
splitties are better for around town, and off road... and the bays were
made for the highway.

I love em all... but a splitty is definitely not only for shows, though i
could be one of a dying breed.  I only know of 2 other people in saint
louis that put daily miles on a split rain or shine.  And to be honest the
tone of the posts about splits on the lists genneraly seem to be people
looking for *correct* *rare* and *NOS* this and that, instead of asking
the best way to keep the thing going for another year of camping in the
sierra nevadas... &amp;/or posts about drooling over restored busses that will
never see a road again unless its between a trailer and a show ring.

But, as always, do your own thing and enjoy doing it! 

take care,

Steve
