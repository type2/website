Subject: Re: [VB] Newer Beetle speedo in early bus?

Would it be possible to use a later speedo in an early bus?
 Granted I cannot imagine over 80 would be a common thing, if ever. 
Thanks,

VW speedometers are seldom accurate. The revs per mile are on the
Speedometer face, you probably have a 806 or 820 revolutions per mile.
That is what your replacement spedometer needs to operate properly.
Most newer speedometer I've seen are in the 1400 range.
