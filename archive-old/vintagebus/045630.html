help - does anyone have a pic of what an engine should look like from a
59/60 bus - i was told that im missing some tin and id like to see a pic
to compare what i have to what i should have

you mean the modified 36hp AKA bastard 40hp that would be original to a bus
from mid 59 through mid 60?   or  for a 40hp or 1600?   where is the tin gone?
are there gaps?  do you have an owners manual handy- that is a great place to
get info on original motors bits- or look at your Bentley vw trans. workshop
manual- there are pics in there though it is later than a 59/60
. . . . . .   .
found a roof rack tonight for $50 cdn - woo hoo - guy says it is
original to a 62/63 westie - it's galvanised with sort of galvanized
pieces of metal running the length of the rack - upon which stuff is
placed - it sort of clips on no screws or anything - looks like 1/2
length - i wonder if it is original to a westie???

score

the westy racks, afaict, are the wood slat kind.  hopefully has two or one
tag(s) - think the 64-67 style is shorter than the 63 &amp; earlier style.
 . . . . . . . 
looks like i found not only a roof for my 59/60 standard - but also a
westie interior from a 62/63 westie - the guy the sold me the roof rack
steered me to the guy he sold the westie to - who has taken out the
motor, tranny and most of the undercarriage - he is a butcher - sucks
for sure but - i need a roof so what do ya do
