Subject: Re: [VB] And the saga begins

----- Original Message -----
&gt; (notice I didn't say restored) as it is not original color, interior,
engine, trans
&gt; and front end etc. so I choose to use the term REBUILT as a replacement
&gt; word for a totaly redone non original VW

Hey Ronnie,

In my opinion, you can call it a restoration. The folks over on the R&amp;R
forum are just touchy. It's not like you're going to call it a 'vintage
restoration', right? I'll consider it a restoration, and I know most people
will too.
