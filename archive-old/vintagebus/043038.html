&gt;  &lt;&lt;I liked the pressed in nut, a lot easier to install the bolt not having to
&gt;  hold both ends at the same time (somehow being under engine and behind bus
&gt;  at the same time). :)  &gt;&gt;

My solution to this loose bolt and pressed-in nut dilemma has been the
following since 1974:

I knock out the pressed-in nut.  I then clean the inside of the left upper
tranny hole immaculately, also the area of the tranny just on the front
side of that hole, and also the bolt.  
I then spread on a generous amount of 3M -80001 yellow
weatherstrip adhesive onto the first 1/2 inch of the bolt's length at the
head-end, and stick it into the hole, and lock a vise grip onto the head
to weigh it and prevent it from turning. I then install the engine, make
sure that the bolt is peeking thru the upper left engine hole, and screw
on the nut and tighten it. Go under and remove the visegrip. 

The next time you remove the engine, the bolt is glued in very well in the
perfect position. It will stay there until you need to replace the tranny.
From then on, you just spin on the nut from the rear of the car, no more
hassling under the car. Except of course the two lower nuts, but they're a
no-brainer to get to. 

I use an excellent tool to remove/install the two upper nuts from the rear
of the bus. It is a flat 17mm/19mm ratcheting box wrench, very thin
(1/2&quot;), quite long (9 or so inches), and allows me to remove or install
the engine in 20 minutes flat. You learn to feel with the wrench as it
goes onto the nut, totally blind, then you tighten or loosen. No trying to
get behind and see, no problem with the doghouse fan housing shrouds, no
problems period. The tool is available at any Sears for about 15 bucks.
You can torque up those nuts with one hand in seconds. 

The only tricky part of course, is starting the nuts onto the ends of the
bolts without dropping them, but I keep extras around in case. Then I
retrieve the dropped ones next time I have the engine out. 

I also use the glue trick on the starter bolt - what the heck. I'm lazy
and like to r and r my engine as effortlessly as possible. I use
anti-sieze on the threads of those bolts too.
