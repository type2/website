&gt; Hi Isaiah
&gt; Let me make sure I read this right - You pulled up to a pump and
&gt; watched
&gt; the guy put the diesel in and now you want to know what recourse you
&gt; have against the gas station?!

I doubt that the fuel was pure diesel.  If it were, the bus wouldn't
run at all if the tank was more than half-empty.

Diesel is so much different from gasoline that it would be pretty hard
to pump a tank full without noticing the difference.  Diesel has a
unique smell, greasy consistancy (which you will feel as a coating on
the nozzle) and a tendancy to foam up.

OTOH, there have been examples of diesel being pumped into light
aircraft by accident.  It can happen.

If the fuel is indeed contaminated, then the tank should be drained and
refilled.  No other cure need apply.
