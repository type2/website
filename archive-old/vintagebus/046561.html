Subject: '59 panel pics
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,
This may sound like a crazy request, but it's for the listees who were _at_ 
BNNTA in september... I saw a few listees snapping pics of my recently 
finished Sealing Wax Red '59 panel and was wondering if any of these pics of 
my bus are online. I have some friends who want to see my bus and I was just 
curious as I don't have a scanner/digicam....
Sorry for such minimal technical content... a bit OT?

Thanks alot for your help,
Pete
