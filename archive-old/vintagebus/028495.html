i would be interested too! i saw one in some mag (maybe The Real Source or 
something) and it was $99. but it was listed for bug only; although 
everything in The Real Source is, and a lot of the things will fit a split 
bus. i have never ordered anything from them. ijust dont want to hack up 
this good rear apron i got last year to shove some bug muffler behind it. is 
it specifically for a bus?
later,
