&lt;&lt; Answer me this to if you will. I did the liquid in the combustion chamber 
on the
 head to see if it would hold, it did. If I do the same thing to the cylinder 
would it hold as well or would the liquid find it's way around the rings??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
No.  The rings only really seal once the engine has reached it's proper 
operating temperature and even then it is never a complete seal like the 
valves in the heads make.   Eric&amp;Barb
