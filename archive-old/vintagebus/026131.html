I think the way I found out my info was into pairs - like 52 should be
interior color, 36 should be upper color, 22 should be lower color.

Like usual, I'm probably not correct, but for my Crew Cab it's 831313 - 83
mesh grey interior, 13 Pearl White upper, 13 Pearl White lower...

66 Crew (Ftiz) - now in technicolor (that's bondo red, rattle can brown,
primer grey, brush-on navy blue, suntan bronze, and oh! there's some pearl
white in the engine bay under the grease...)
