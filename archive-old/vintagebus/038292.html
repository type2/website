Subject: Tricky front end squeak? 
Date: Fri, 7 Jul 2000 11:29:12 +0200 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi,

I thought I had it beat but I don't. 

I have greased the crap out of every greasable joint on the front end with
the wheels way off the ground. I did the greasing with the link pins
adjusted at their slackest and correctly adjusted them afterwards. After
greasing I manually moved the suspension up and down on both sides in an
attempt to work it through, wiped off all the grease and regreased and
worked the suspension. 

There is minimal play in the front end.

I have subsequently fitted new tyres and new shocks.

The suspension in question is stock '60(built december '59) on a doublecab. 

The squeak is only on the left side and appears to be coming from the
control arms where they fit into the torsion arms. With the shocks off the
left side doesn't rebound as smoothly as the right when the suspension is
pumped from below.

Are the needle bearings in there shot or is there another possibility? If
the needle bearings are shot are replacements available and if so from whom?

I have about two weeks to get this thing sorted out before a 750 mile road
trip.

TIA

Michael
