Subject: Re: Clutch and brake pedal shaft &quot;felt&quot; seals...

&gt;
&gt;Then at some unknown magical date (not shown in any of my early Spare
&gt;Parts List books),

I checked through the Doliwa book and couldn't find a date on this
either.

&gt;VW again modified the seal by totally eliminating the felt seal along
&gt;with it's metal retainer and coming out with the round rubber seal that
&gt;fits snuggly (moves up and down with the shaft) onto the pedal shaft
&gt;and seals against the flat underside surface of the floor only when
&gt;the pedal isn't pushed down (my '67 Westy is like this).

Check out these pages in the '63-'67 Bentley:
V-9 3, third picture
V-10 3, second picture
B-2 6

All of these seem to show the round rubber seal that rides up and down
with the pedal shaft.

In the online '67 parts book, they list one felt and retainer for Buses
up to chassis 501 706 and another felt and retainer from 501 707.  But
they also list a &quot;Sealing sleeve - Push rod&quot; from 501 707.  I wonder if
maybe both the felt and the rubber seal were used, with the felt perhaps
glued to the floor inside the cab.

I checked my '64 (built 15 Nov 1963) and the brake pedal has a rubber
seal and no felt.  The clutch pedal has a square felt on top of the floor
(but under the floor mat) and I'm not sure what it has on the bottom.

&gt;They look pretty simple to reproduce.

It seems to me that if you could get a source of felt sheets of different
thicknesses and densities, a lot of the felt packings and sealing strips
on a Bus would be pretty easy to cut out.  A little Googling reveals
http://www_dot_usfelt_dot_com/techdata/index.html and
http://www.bostonfelt_dot_com/sae_tech.htm for technical info and possible
sources.
