Ja; (*sigh*) if it were only $5000...

But still, everyone is thinking at the $1500 level.  I get countless
emails from people along the lines of &quot;I'm a poor college student and
I really want a bus so I can tag along with the rest of the Phish slackers.
I have $1500 and I want something with no rust and it has to run good
because I have no mechanical skillz. And it has to be one of the ones
with the big sunroof because those are so cool&quot;

&gt; Ya, just cause you dropped $5,000 into your bus does not mean you could sell 
&gt; it for that much.

&gt;  &gt; Thats stoopid, some folks would rather pay $1100 for a rust bucket rather 
&gt;  &gt; than kick down the extra $400 for a solid bus. unless you enjoy metal work 
&gt;  &gt; and already have the bits it just doesnt make since.
