i know this may be a sin to discuss, but gregg at vintagewarehouse_dot_com sold 
me some inserts that i used on my bug and i feel that there is a big plus to 
these. you can use almost any tire you please and still have that all too 
classic appearance. my bug gets easily twice the looks than before the 
inserts(if that is any incentive for you i dont know)but just something to 
consider.
good luck
zac
