Subject: Re: Ranting

Heres my biggest ranting: Listies who run there sentences on and on
and make me shift right for 2 feet untill they enter back to the next
sentence. If I see it going past page on monitor I delete and go to 
next post. Some people keep the sentence going 500 feet to the right.
DELETE !!!!.
