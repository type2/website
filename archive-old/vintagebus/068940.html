Hi Andy,
Our method tends to result in a more accurate/even bearing adjustment because 
you are using the threads pitch on the spindle for the proper spacing.  
Instead of a feel the washer slide, which can be affected due to unknown 
feel/pressure from someones hands, length of screwdriver and even friction 
between parts.  So far after nearly 250,000 miles of driving and repairing 
our own VWs we have not had a single front wheel bearing go bad.  Only time 
we have had to replace these bearings is when found bad when we first get an 
old VW.
  We will be very interested to hear how your experimenting goes!
