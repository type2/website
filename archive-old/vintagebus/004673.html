ANYWAY......Like Thom said, ENOUGH OF THE HOOVER THING! I said MY
apologies and people are STILL acting like there's a thread going
on!!! Hasn't everyone said all they can???
On to the bus material...I read the Idiot's manual and I clearly
understand the &quot;How To Drive A VW&quot; section, but having driven a
watercooled Cabriolet for the last ten years, I am not accustomed to
the sounds I hear coming from this little VW engine during higher
revs.  It seems that if I follow the shifting guidelines I get
this -flat- kind of sound and I think I'm about to blow something up.
Also, I should REALLY never shift up to 4th while going 35-40 mph?
Excuse the very beginner question, but after a month of driving, I
want to make sure I'm not tearing up my engine.  It was rebuilt 500
miles ago if that makes a difference.  PLEASE, if this question seems
just too silly to you, DON'T reply with a bashing! I DID read, but I
just have to get a live person's opinion.  Thank you in advance, and
PLEASE stick to the &quot;NO MORE HOOVER' rule laid down by our list
admin!!!
