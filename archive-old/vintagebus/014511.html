My bus used to have one of those!  Was yours the one with the metal bracket
into the wheelwell or another design?  I am looking for one of the former to
complete my resto.  These are much better than the ones that bend your
roofrack and you can't leave on while moving.  (Unless you are a die hard
Westy kid..) I will probably have to make my own, but it will be good practice
with the mig welder and the tube bender... Anybody know what tubing would be
best for this?  What sizes were used for the racks?  Does anybody reproduce
the clamps for Westfalia roofracks?
