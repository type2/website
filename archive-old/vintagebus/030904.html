I would very much like to correct you on your misapplied
patriotism/China bashing on at least 2 accounts:

1. It has absolutely nothing to do with VintageBus list and its serving
purpose. It wasn't Friday either.
2. China was not created by the USA, so when you say it owes its
existence to the US you are logically wrong, since China has been in
documented existence for 3000 years or longer. You could argue, however,
that China was help preserved by the US after WW2, but that's still a
tough argument to make and a doctoral thesis away, on some other
acedemic mailing list, not VB.

Further more:
3. The massive &quot;efforts&quot; by the US to revenge the bombings of Pearl
Harbor resulted in 200,000 total Japanese civilian deaths in 2 atomic
bombings, roughly equivilant to one Oklahoma City bombing per day for 3
years straight. Japan was the last Axis nation left on its war leg at
that time, and its war machine was failing. The US could have continued
its long range bombing missions but decided to carry out the atomic
bombing to test its capabilities.

4. The communist party in China were the controlling voice you hear via
propaganda. And apparently that is what you bought into mostly. Most
other Chinese people long for freedom and prosperity. Some of them
demonstrated their eagerness to come here by stuffing thmselves in
containers an ocean away. So its not how soon they forget, but how much
you actually know.

5. The parts are made in China for the sole reason of dirt cheap labor.
Who exported the jobs? If you cannot link it together, It's you and your
supplier, who want the lowest grade at the lowest cost possible. Your
companies buy the repro part from the Chinese and in turn you buy it
from them. The trade deficit is a direct result of high US labor cost.
Either you enjoy our high standard of living provided here, or you can
live like a cheap Chinese laborer pressing hubcaps while hearing your
communist leader on air bragging about US Trade profit for the nation
and, by the way, we need to hate Americans.


So, if you don't mind, keep your VB postings bus related, and p-mail
your political statements to your congressmen/women, for I am a VB list
member and I do not appriciate your personal opinion.
