Brad,

Check the high idle cam on the carb. It might have flipped over.
There's supposed to be a pin in the side of the carb to prevent this,
but sometimes it falls out. The high idle cam is connected to the
choke and it's on the left side of the carb. It has a stairstep
looking side and a big smooth side. The stairs are supposed to be
facing the arm with the screw that your accelerator cable is connected
to. If the big smooth side is facing the arm it holds your throttle
open and races the engine.
