Does anyone have a good modern day source for the grey paint originally used on the gas tanks?  Is it flat?  Seems to be, but then again flat paint normally tends to show grease, oil stains and this paint doesn't seem to do that, especially considering where it is.  Rather than search through every paint store looking for something close, I thought I'd see if someone else has done that leg work.

I saw a local bus the other day that had a repainted gas tank but the owner did it in a much lighter grey, it just didn't look right IMHO.

TIA.

Robert
