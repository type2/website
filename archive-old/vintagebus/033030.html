Subject: 59 or earlier panel
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was passed today by a orange beetle with flames and a 59 panel i think,
both had roof racks and stuff up there and both had New Mexico tags.
this is in New Jersey on the turnpike around exit 13.
just wondering if it was alist member or a friend.   waved to the guy he 
waved back,
 I was okay with the world after that(never saw a spitty being driven on the 
road here)
