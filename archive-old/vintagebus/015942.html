Doubt they're any different now, unless they've completely re-tooled.
Here is the short story on repro safaris:

Wolfgang: Square (incorrect) channel, uses brazlian bug vent-wing latches
with the backs cut off and two holes drilled in them for the latches.
Weak spot welds, thin &quot;powder coating&quot; and an annoyingly large logo 
etched into the glass (why the f*ck do they feel the need to do that?)
(I had a set of these in the '56. started rusting in 3 months or so; one
of the frames broke before that.  calls to get a new set were unsucessful.)

BusBoys: same as wolfgang.  wolfgang is actually a dissident faction that
secceeded from BusBoys years ago.  they're both in redding, ca

Izzy's: correct frame shape, but not double-walled like the originals.
Quality is reported to be good, although they're having problems getting
them made fast enuf to keep up with demand.  Correct-er looking latches
and mounting

Creative Engineering: correct-but-single-walled frame, mis-matched dash
tabs for some reason (one's thick, one's thin); installed with a little more
hassle than the wolfgang ones, but I'm told by VERY reputable sources
that that is normal for pre-63 buses.  Seals are non-stock, but work,
virtually indestructable latch bases.  I have these on the '60 right now.

Creative Engineering is the only supplier that sells frames in primer.
If you think about it, unless your bus just happens to be their shade
of white, or you're a cal-look-boy and want chrome, it's not going to match.
Extra Points to CE for this detail.

Wolfgang and Creative Engineering both make side popouts.  I tried 
the wolfgang ones, but they didn't get the radii on the corners anywhere
near correct.  I haven't seen the CE ones.  CE also makes barndoor
safaris.
