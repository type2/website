Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Question

 I had a compufire until I reversed the + and - in a too hasty coil
swap and destroyed it. $60 in trash. Points took me a while to set
right the first time, mine worked out to .013 not .016, but they
haven't budged in the 10,000 miles since. I didn't notice a bit of
difference in the performance, but I drive pretty slow by choice, the
bus is just the excuse.

----- Original Message ----- Also looking for advice regarding
converting to electronic ignition –vs-
points. . ..
