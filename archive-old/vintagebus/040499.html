I am looking for a tow bar for my '67 bus. I checked Rocky Mountain 
Motorworks, and they had one for the Beetle and another for the Super 
Beetle, would either of these work? If not any suggestions on where to get 
one for a decent price. ( Rocky Mountain Motorworks has free shipping on 
their website, which is why I ask about them specifically)
Thanks
Ben
