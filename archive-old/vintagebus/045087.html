&lt;&lt; Hi everybody -
 I hope you are all hanging in there well. Things must be good for me
 (in busland anyhow) because all I can find to bitch about is my
 speedometer. Since getting back to CA, where things finally dried out,
 it has been all the time squeak squeak squeak like a rusty rat wheel.
 I am assuming it is the cable, although I guess it could be the speedo
 itself, and I'd like to lube it before it sends me slipping and
 sliding those last few steps into madness. Oil? Graphite? WD40?
 Something else? I am concerned about gumming things up in there.
 Th &gt;&gt;

Had this happen in my bug years ago, and it drove me batty, horrible noise.   
Luckily my mom's friend Karen knew exactly what it was, she has a 66 bug, and 
said just disconnect the speedo cable and the noise will stop.   I kind of 
like having the speedo work, so I sprayed some wd40 down the cable tubing and 
reattached it and the noise went away.  Never had it happen since.
