If I see anything over about 8 V to ground anywhere on my Bus except for
the D+ terminal on the generator, something is badly wrong...

&gt; If you get these readings, the complete gas gauge wiring system,

Which doesn't exist on any split-window Bus or any bay-window Bus through

&gt; etc are good. [...] BTW, Volkswagen has a special variable resistance

So does Radio Shack, as I posted previously.

&gt; Somewhat like the adjustable rheostat for the lights in your living room,
&gt; only costs ten times as much.

Actually, the fuel gauge sender and Radio Shack potentiometer work on a
totally different principle than a household light dimmer.  Also, the
Radio Shack part costs about $3 or $4.
