Exactly, the &quot;Panels with Tents Club&quot; is what I had in mind, but the Vintage
Nazi faction harrassed poor John in Atlanta so relentlessly that he took the
panel I wanted off the market. I guess he's taken it back into his
laboratory to coat that purple primer with Teflon for the next time he tries
to sell it.
By the way...if I take a stock panel bus and attach a tent to it, does that
make it a POS custom that I can never suck my money back out of??

&gt; So you just threw away the &quot;accessory&quot; portion and kept the tent, right?
&gt;
&gt; Now you can buy a panel and join the &quot;Panels with Tents Club&quot;!!!

&gt; &gt; I bought a nearly identical tent to the one on e-bay, almost as good
&gt; &gt; condition, it was complete and had only been used a couple of times.
&gt; &gt; I paid $2,000.00 for mine, but it came with the &quot;Westfalia camper&quot;
&gt; &gt; accessory.
