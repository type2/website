Subject: starter woes

So I'm running a 6 volt starter in my 12 volt bus and I love it, love it,
love it.  I just touch the key and it starts right up.  Anyway, over the
late winter early spring I was having a bit of trouble starting my bus.  I
tried a few times and eventually it started.  The other day I tried to start
my bus and when I turned the key it wouldn't start.  The starter turned over
but it was like the gears weren't meshing or something.  After about the
fifth try it started and I haven't had any problems since.  I have noticed
these symptoms maybe 5 or 6 times over the last 6 months.  I suspect that my
start bushing should be changed but it is less than 1 year old.  Does this
all make sense?

TIA
