Being relatively new to the nuances of bus restoration I have a newbie style 
question.  This thread is talking about restoration of window frames... the 
actual frame surrounding the glass right ?  I haven't gotten near that stage 
yet but a cursory exam of my windows before the bus was overwhelmed with my 
bug restoration effort I did not see any screws.  Could someone briefly 
elighten this newbie.  I had almost thought frame restoration to specialized 
for me with frame soldering or the like but it is sounding very doable 
according to this.  Thanks to the brave soul who answers.

Another reason I ask is that we have a specialty store near here.. the 
&quot;screw shop&quot;.  If what I hear is correct I should try to extract a screw and 
touch bases with them... what was the size again ?

&gt;  ...and also I hear that finding replacement screws is hard.
&gt;
&gt;derrick writ:
&gt;I ordered enough screws for 6 popouts sometime last
&gt;year from Wolfgang.  I think it ran me about $5.  It
&gt;is a 3.5X5mm flat head screw.  Have a nice day :)
&gt;- - -  --
&gt;great- I am glad they are available.   Hurray for Wolfgang.    I forget
&gt;exactly what the deal was, but I heard that the replacement screws people 
&gt;had
&gt;found had a diff size head or length or something they were not quite 
&gt;right.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know have many buses you have to take apart to fill a little film
&gt;container with good used popout window screws?
