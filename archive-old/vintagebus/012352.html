   back in the hayday of the 356 PORSCHE market
i ran across a lot of these so called restorations
people were pulling out junk sculpting them into shape with bonbo nice paint and interior and pawning these cars off as total restorations
i called them rustojunktions that would fall apart after a year or so on the road, all 356 PORSCHES that were restored in my shop for me or a customer were photo documented from start to finish so anybody could see what went into the car
it's funny to look at these pictures again and hard to believe how much time and money went into a proper restoration, if you can't afford to do it right buy a done one and live with what you get
    with the popularity of the early split window
buses on the rise it's becoming more common to see restored JUNK out there for sale ie; the last POMONA and these people want top dollar for there junk,so if your looking for a bus buy an unrestored with a little rust ok or buy that restored bus but ask for documentation on the work done, i take photos as does  a few other people i know who deal in buses no lies 
see what your getting agree on what you are getting and everyones happy
