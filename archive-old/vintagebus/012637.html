Fun show from my vantage point. Drove the '54 Barn &quot;Ambulator camper&quot; to
Competition Engineering for thier 10th Anniversary party. Caravaned with my
wife in her '67 Westy. She made an appearence and headed back home. I
continued on to the show site with the usual hardcore Albuquerque crew and
camped over night. I felt like Craig Breedlove by obtaining 100kph on the
way there! woo-hoo!
I decided to help Rex Eastman &lt;vws4sale_at_inreach_dot_com&gt; with his booth for the
day. He stayed very busy all day long and then hauled buns driving in his
modern rocket for Kelly Park! Totally hardcore!!!!

Swap was sizable, weather cleared with none of the howling wind that has
plagued Phoenix lately. Saw tons of friends at the show and had a super day.
Kept my spending very low dough.

Caravaned back to the mid city &quot;Rusty Ranch&quot; for a suburban neighborhod
invasion and a front yard hippie BBQ with the NM crowd and a few locals.
Lots of laughs.
Mechanical failure of the day was my '54 which blew the #4 plug and its
previously unnoticed huge sized insert out of the hole on the way back from
the show. Not even a trace of threads left in the hole. Max speed of 60 kph
on &lt;not mph!&gt; I-10 made us a popular attraction with the truckers. &lt;NOT!!!!&gt;
Didn't realize that the thing was barfing so badly until nearly home. The
plug must have been grounding out most of the way. Thought that I had a hell
of an exhaust leak so I limped it on home. Will now need to yank the head
and R&amp;R with parts off of a core 36 that was nabbed up for me by a house NM
house guest at a small show on Sun AM. Talk about luck. =)

Reports of the car show and other swap action will be left to others as I
barely &lt;volutarily&gt; broke away from Rex's booth. The only show vehicles that
I had time to notice were 1. the impressive progress that has been made on
the splittie Double Cab that Arizona Bus Club will raffle off at the next
Jerome Jamboree, 2. a beautiful white poptop westy from Riverside, and 3. a
very pretty sealing wax and white '62 flip seat hatch roofed Westy. Thanks
to all of the out of towners who made the effort to support the Arizona VW
scene.
