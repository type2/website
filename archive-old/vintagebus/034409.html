Indeed,

and
(a)sitting inside the centre chassis sections,
(b) inside the outriggers and 
(c) trapped between the outer sills, inner rockers and floor

Not just between the floor and belly pans - and then it gets
wet and your blasted and nicely painted (on the outside)
bus rots from within inside two years.

I hate sandblasting (OK for components but).  
If you do it I believe you have to be
ready to open ALL these sections to get the stuff out.
Plastic media blasting is better (but slower) and can still
sit in there and block the 'normal' water egress points
in the chassis.  I'd only blast a basket case bus BEFORE
a 'complete' metal replacement job where all these sections
will be opened and/or replaced!

Sand blasting and seat belts - both get me sorta excited!

&gt; Subject:	Questions: Sandblasting a 23 window
&gt; 
&gt; My next door neighbor is working on a correct resto of a 23 window bus
&gt; that was pulled out of a dried up river bed.  He would like to take it
&gt; to a local guy that specializes in bead &amp; metal blasting of classic cars
&gt; and have both the inside and outside done from head to toe.  Here's the
&gt; problem.  One these buses, the belly pan runs the length of the bus and
&gt; is welded in.  He is picturing the sand blasting adding 50lbs of weight
&gt; in the sand trapped between the floor and the pans.
&gt; 
&gt; How would someone get rid of trapped sand?  Any suggestions for this or
&gt; otherwise?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Scott
