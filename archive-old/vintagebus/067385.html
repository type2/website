Subject: RE: [VB] Oil Change

Tom -

Question for ya..

Is the oil leaking from dead center  of the bus?  Is it leaking from the oil
sump that you just fiddled with, or is it leaking further back(towards the
front of the bus)?

If that is the case, sounds like one of two things.  Front Main seal of the
engine, or tranny shaft seal.

Let us know where the leak is coming from, and we'll figure it out... - K
