Subject: Sportsmaster camper?
Date: Tue, 20 Oct 1998 13:57:49 -0700

I need any info on the &quot;Sportsmaster&quot; or &quot;Sportscamper&quot; conversions out of
California. Pictures and brochures are what I am mostly interested in. 
This conversion was done mostly on splitwindow busses and are very similar
to the ASI Riveria Line out of Vancouver Wash.
The pop tops in these conversions were tan and had one big window that
wraped around the front of the pop top.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.$$$
