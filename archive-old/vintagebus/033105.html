&lt;&lt; Here in Oz vendors have been selling a rust repair section that includes 
the
 outer four inches
 of cargo floor, and all rockers for just this sort of repair.....(to suit
 LHD bus)..
 made by Veng?  They are sorta OK but you do get a better result by replacing
 the whole
 lot than trying to patch bits in.... &gt;&gt;

Yeah thats what i was informed of just a little while ago.  I would rather go 
with the floor and rocker together and replace as a whole.

On the floor just inside the rocker there is a big hole at the middle seat 
points.  I removed the swiss cheese portion and got a much deeper look into 
the belly of the bus with a snake type flashlight.  I even have a mini digi 
cam that i cramed in there, turned on the flash and got some interesting 
photos.  All the inner pieces believe it or not are all still the original 
primer gray.  Real light surface rust here and there but nothing that i can 
see thus far thats rusted.  Too bad i dont have some type of X-Ray do-dad 
thingy magigger to use.  

I think ill get a better look at the inside of the rocker after i cut a small 
section out such as you suggested.  If theres a better way, let me know.

(side note)

almost all the rust besides that rocker area have been blasted and are 
awaiting just a couple more pieces to get this sucker really going.  All the 
glue inside is out now and all the surface rust is gone.  Its looking sooooo 
much cleaner than before.

Thanks
