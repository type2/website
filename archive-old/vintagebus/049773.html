Subject: Re: [VB] What size radial tire ? - more sizes than you want to
 think about!

The plot thickens!  It turns out that the European sized metric tires, like
a 185SR14 for example, do not have an 80% aspect ratio, but 82% or 83% (I
forget which, but I think it's 82%).  This changes things just a bit.  I've
added the Euro spec tires to the list of acceptable 14&quot; and 15&quot; sizes for
buses.


Bentley says that the 3/4 ton (small nut) models came with a 6.40-15 tire,
having a diameter of 27.16&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest European radial tire size a 185R15

How about running 14&quot; wheels on a 3/4 ton (small nut) bus?

Good luck getting most of these on the back.  I've gotten some big tires on
the back of an old bus by letting the air out while wedging the tire
between the drum and the body lip, and then refilling it after getting the
wheel bolted up.



One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter of
26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14
