&gt; I say yes to folks letting us know on items they
&gt; have for sale&lt;&lt;

I usually try not to chime in on stuff like this, but
;^)  &quot;For Sale&quot; ads are permitted on the list.  Whats
the difference you ask between a For Sale ad and an
Ebay ad??  The only reason to sell on an auction site
is to see how much money you can get for an item.  The
more the better, right?? Well, I am certainly not
against making money but...this list is about helping
other VW owners. So please tell us when you have a
FAIR price on a quality VW item for sale, But please
don't say &quot;I have a VW part to help out a fellow
Vdubber and I'll give it to the person who offers me
the MOST money!&quot;  Personally, I believe it conflicts
with the primary purpose of the list, which is helping
one another.  Me? Yes, I do sell some items on auction
sites when I need the bread and YES I do advertise
some parts for sale on this list if I have something I
don't need and probably won't need, however, I don't
advertise the same things both on auctions AND on the
list. Because as stated earlier, I sell on auctions to
make bread...and I sell on the list to help other
v-dubbers.  I have both given and recived FREE STUFF
from listmembers, I have NEVER recieved anything free
from an auction site!!
So if you want to help others, advertise on the
list..If you primarlily want to make bread, go to the
auctions, theres NOTHING wrong with doing either ;^)
Ok, off my soap box now...
