&gt;Got two boxes that handle the lighting. 

Yep.  The 9 prong box doesn't have anything to do with the headlights.

&gt;Different units, so I would first suspect your turnsignal switch is
&gt;not having that fresh feeling as it is involved both times. 

Isn't everyone supposed to be walking along the beach at sunset before
we can discuss this?  :)

&gt;Testing the headlight dipping relay is fairly easy, figure out which 
&gt;terminal is the signal (it comes from the turnsignal switch), and hit
&gt;it with a hot jumper wire while the lights are on. 

Should be a skinny brown wire on a terminal marked &quot;S&quot;.  I *think*,
though, that you have to jump it to ground (not hot) to activate
the relay.  The turn signal switch doesn't have a hot feed to
connect it to...it does have a ground wire (brown, circuit 31)
though.  I'm pretty sure it connects these two brown wires together
(relay coil to ground) to make the headlight relay work.

&gt;Finicky tail and turn lights can be lots of things, grounds
&gt;being bad, cruddy contacts, etc., all possibilities.
&gt;Check it out and let us know.

The flasher has to have a minimum load to flash, so if you have
a poor ground at one of your bulbs, it can make the flasher go
slowly or not at all.

If you're really convinced that your nine-prong box is at
fault, you can get at least brake lights and turn signals with
a little wire and a &quot;generic&quot; turn-signal flasher.  Having
the hazard lights will require more work (relays).

Good luck!
