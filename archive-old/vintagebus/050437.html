&gt;   Didn't Kyle have an engine grenaded by one of these??
&gt; mounting nut sucked into pickup or somesuch?
&gt;   If you have a hot rodded, non-stock motor you may need
&gt; extra oil capacity as the oil could be pumped out faster
&gt; than it can return to the sump. I run a mild 1776, don't
&gt; run high revs and check the oil level at every fill up.

True story. Engine that was in the single when I got it. Sucked the mounting
nut and split the driven gear in the oil pump. Nice idea having four and a
half quarts of oil and not a drop for the engine. I still run a one and a
half quart sump that uses a pickup screen, but that is on a 2275. It has so
much volume of air, rods, and crank moving around in what is left of the
case that it is hard for the oil to find its way to the pickup tube fast
enough without it. It's not so much that it pumps it out too fast, it just
gets lost on the way back. I only run stock oil pumps. I haven't ever added
additional bearings to an engine, so haven't needed the higher volume models
yet.

Your pushrod tubes do more oil cooling than a deep sump. Either you need one
or you don't. If I was building an engine with a stock crank throw I
wouldn't even come close to using one. On a rail or baja or something that
can spend a while on an incline and starve the oil pump I would, as on a big
stroker. YMMV
