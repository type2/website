Subject: Vehicle Trolley for VW

Has anyone used the VW vehicle trolley when working on their bus.  The trolley
I'm talking about is VW Tool # 603.  I found the plans to build one of these
and on the pictures it shows a bug being moved around with it.  The
description states that it can be used on type 1, 2 or 3 vehicles.  However
when I look at the point where the vehicle sits on it the front mounts don't
line up with anything on the frame of my bus.  Just wondering if anyone has
used this tool and if the dimensions have to be different on a bus as opposed
to a beetle.

Thanks

Dave
