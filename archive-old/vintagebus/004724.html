Well, alrighty then. :^) Hey, it would be real nifty if you could take a
mirror and have a look down those carbs to see what number is on the
venturi's. Should be right on top of the throat on one side. Sometimes it's
filed off, though. Thanks.

Mike,
Since he's got a crank breather into his balance tube, sounds like he's
running a lot fatter main jet. If he could find a number for the venturis
he's running, you'd probably want to be a couple mm's bigger. Not a great
deal of volume difference in his motor and yours. As to cleaning the main
jet passages and such, that would be a very good idea, as in excellent.
Another thing that can cause lean running in Webers is too low of a float
bowl setting. Seriously. It has the effect of changing the emulsion tube
because they are all calibrated based on the absolutely correct height and
all. Too low, too lean. Too high, too rich. All this is during mid and high
range. Double and triple check while in there. Barb and Eric wrote that too
rich could also cause this. I hadn't gathered that it was running rough or
puffing black smoke, so I didn't lean this way, but it is of course a
possibility. With too small of a venturi, even a too rich mixture will be so
well vaporized it will run, but it wouldn't tend to have no power at all
like lean, and should actually take off right when you crack the butterfly.
Sudden satisfactory amount of air and all. Or puke if it gets too much
accelerator pump action. Find the joy.
