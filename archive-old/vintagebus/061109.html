&gt; Again, Stoddard Imports (Ohio), Pelican Parts (cali), Tweeks (part of real
&gt; source),Parts Obsolete (Oregon), The Parts Shop, 356 Limited, Bernie Bergman
&gt; and I think Gene Berg. You can also order from any Porsche dealer as this is
&gt; in there NLA (something VW should do) parts program. I will look in my
&gt; Porsche book for the part numbers, yes they come inner pulley, outer pulley
&gt; and the hub, 3 pieces. You can buy each piece seperate

Are the 356 and early 912 pulleys the same?
Hub for Pulley, 912 (1965-69)  			547-09-304
Inner Pulley Half, w/notches, 912 (1965-69)	539-09-315
Outer Pulley Half, no notches, 912 (1965-69)	539-09-316
