&lt;&lt; When did the outlet diameter change? Right when they went to fresh air? Or
 when they improved the J-tube with fins?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Fresh air heating started (15?)DEC62, and the larger diameter outlet sometime 
about DEC63.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS  Forgot to mention that over the years we have only found one small outlet 
fresh air heater stock with interior fins inside the J-tube.  Probably this 
happened during the last of the small outlet production when the new improved 
J-tubes started to be produced.  EEE&amp;B
