Subject: 30pict1 and overrich

sent this to the gent who sold me a NOS 30pict1... who hasn't had time to
reply yet, so i'm bugging you folks!

...

it still seems to have a few quirks; when first started, the carb will run
for a second and stall. i found that  the bowl would empty overnight - not
sure if it leaks or is being siphoned thru the throat. not much to do about
the second! if you stay on the pedal, the bowl will fill and it will run.
second, it idles extremely slowly when cold, even when fully choked. if i
crank on the idle speed screw to compensate, it will idle at 12-1500 rpm
when warm.
third, it stumbles on accelleration, in a very specific way: instead of a
smooth, throaty curve, it coughs and splutters a few seconds before
catching. its possible that the pump nozzle is not aimed right, but it
sounds more like an overrich coughing. i noticed that the accel pump has NO
adjustment! i am considering replacing the arm with an adjustable one.
fourth - it simply runs and idles too rich. i have adjusted the float valve
to have the original steel washer plus two copper washers under the needle
valve. helped a little. fuel pump is adjusted to bentley. i suspect the
starting oddity is related to overrichness, as well.

jets are the stock 120m 125z pilot 55 idle.

now, most of this stuff is just tuning, so any tips would be apprciated.
this is in a stock 1600 sp/stock muffler; i'm using a castiron 019 with a
known-good advance curve (coz my other dizzys have all gone south!).

i briefly had a 130z emulsion tube in it, but it popped at hard accel, so
it was a bit lean.
i'm going to try a 117.5 main, but am concerned my top speed will fall off,
as well as accelleration.

...

today, the damn thing wouldn't idle at first; then it kept hiccuping at
idle, like it was having lil teeny backfires into the carb. adjusted the
idle screw waay out, went away - but now stinks like gas.

i have about had it with these mystery overrich problems - 3 carbs, 6
dizzys, 3 diff fuel pumps... proper shim height at pump, proper fuel
pressure (less than 3 psi at 3500), a good dizzy that advances properly,
correct valves, no intake leaks. 2 shims on dizzy drive. stock cleaner.
stock exhaust. stock cam.
afaik, i've eliminated every cause suggested to me from bently to hoover.

anyone out there an exorcist??
