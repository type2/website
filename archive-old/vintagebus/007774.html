&gt;Ok, I've run across a strange bus.  It has a split-window front-end,
&gt;a narrow-hatch back end, round taillights, and a sliding door!  It also has
&gt;baywindow-style side windows - the long ones.  It also has push-button
&gt;front door handles.  To top it off, it has deluxe skylights, but no
sunroof.


Well Ronnie - what about the narrow hatch, round tail lights, and skylights?
I don't think this would be a baysplit - more a brazilian in nature I would
say.  Who knows though - with good body men these days, you can expect to
find anything...
