Subject: chrome fried eggs

hey guys...
a friend of mine has a bus that has chrome rings on the turnsignals.
These are rings that are the exact shape of the chrome part of the turn
signal lens...except the go over the lens and screw on with the lens as
the holes line up.  These would be a great alternative to buying new
lenses (EXPENSIVE!) as you could just pick up these rings and slap em on
to make your turn signals look new.  I would love to do this...but I
can't find the dern things....

anyone know where I can pick up a set?
it would make that chipped chrome dissappear! :)
