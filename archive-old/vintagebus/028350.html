I haven't noticed any decrease in performance, unless the rack is loaded to the
gills with tires.  Ask me how I know ;-)
I run an early full length rack on my 71 and all I really notice is the howling
wind...and even that isn't too bad.  It is only noticeable at the warp speeds
that only a bus can attain...heh

I'm going to transplant the rack to my new bus as soon as it moves in...but I
don't want to wreck the paint on the new bus.  I was thinking of getting some
of that rubberize rubbercoat stuff from a hardware store and dipping the ends
of the rack and the ends of the clamps in them to keep them from marring the
paint.  You know...the kind of stuff they dip tools in....but clear.  The stuff
is kinda spendy...about 8 bucks for a bottle of it...
Has anyone ever tried this?

&gt; Had anyone noticed a significant degredation in performance when travelling
&gt; with a roof rack?
