&gt;i remember finding some type of hand pump for getting the transmission
&gt;oil in the small hole that is at an extremely difficult angle to reach.

I bought a hand suction pump at AutoZone when I changed my gear oil.
The body is a metal cylinder like a grease gun, but it has a fat
plastic hose at one end and a T-handle at the other.  You put the hose
in the oil, pull the handle to suck up oil, put the hose in the
transmission, and push the handle to dispense oil.  I have also heard
that Sta-Lube sells a pump that fits on their gear oil bottles but
I haven't found one yet.
