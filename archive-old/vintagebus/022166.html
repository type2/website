&gt;OTOH, when is somoene going to kick the NEATO folks in the butt to get their
&gt;web page going?  I think it's absolutely stoopid to *remove* the page
&gt;during renovation.  Leave the old crappy one up until you get the new content
&gt;worked out, then bring in the new one.  

The NEATO web page is something *I* started, and *I* have paid for it 
out of my own pocket since day one.  No NEATO funds have gone towards 
the maintenance of it.  The NEATO page is a priveledge, not a right.
It will go back up when I have it ready.
