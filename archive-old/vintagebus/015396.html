Yeesh... all my VW problems have been wiring.

My 1965 Microbus went from fine one day to dead ignition switch and no 
lights the next. Jumped the starter and once it was running, got lights. 
What gives, guru's? How come no lights without it running? Any ideas on how 
to fix the wiring without re-creating the problem? I've heard something 
about a horn-relay vs. ford solenoid thingie..... How would you wire it up? 
Does it sound like it's related to my problem?

It was fine one day, and then the next day......   8(
