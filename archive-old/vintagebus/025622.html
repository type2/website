Hi mighty fellow VW gurus,

My '67 just got out of the garage after a lot of improvment! To make a
long stoy short, it overheated when a rag I had left in the engine
compartment got into the fan (I know - I am stupid). The engine did not
blow but came close. I had to install a new rear axle (tranny, shafts &amp;
redux boxes) so I had my wrench do an autopsy on the engine. I also
redid the bumpers and installed my PLF-made curtains in the meantime.

We got the old tranny and shafts out and put the new one in in a day and
we then started on the engine. Heads were not cracked but they were
warped by .013&quot;, had them resurfaced. Combustion was good, valve closure
too. After doing a zillion thing on the engine (clean it, change seals,
new clutch disc, striaghten and paint tins, upgrade to doghouse cooler,
etc.) we put it back in a closed everything. Engine runs great and bye
bye tranny howls and redux box grinds. Runs really great now.

BUT, after 600 miles, I realized that gear oil was slowly leaking from
both wheels. I remember we had a hard time with the outer wheel bearing
seals kit. It seems that it's the same kit for a bunch of beetles and
all splitties. Apart form a metal washer not being used (as per Blue
Bentley's directives) , there was a certain seal that seemed to belong
to a 36mm axle nut and not a 46mm. We had to stretch it to make it go on
the axle all the way to the bearing, past the flanges. Have any of you
guys had any problems with this kit or have any clues on this?

(btw, my last month 3rd and 4th gear shifting problems were solved with
new bushings).
