Subject: trouble with points

So my bus has been backfiring and gurgling when I downshift...  I don't
think it's an exhaust leak like I had before, because I tightened up all the
exhaust connections.  I have a 1600 with 009 setup.  I recently adjusted the
valves, checked the plugs, etc. When looking at the points and turning the
engine, the points do not open and close.  I'm following the points
adjusting procedure as suggested by Mr. Muir, and since one of the first
steps is to check how the points open and close, I can't move on to the next
step! I don't know what's going on. Is there something stupid that I am
overlooking? Are my points bad?  The engine runs, I just have the backfiring
problem.  I've never played with the timing or points before (16,000 miles
on engine) so any tips are appreciated! Thank you!
