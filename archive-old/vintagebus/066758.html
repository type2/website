Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

If the sockets are wasted you can go down to your local auto parts store and
pick up sockets that clip into a round hole. then cut the back out with a
round hole and pop them in from the back. While you have them out attach a
ground wire to the socket (not the light housing). Remove the pigtial, clean
off a spot on the socket (remove the plating) and solder a ground wire to
it. Reassemble and install. I did this on my '67 Kombi (may she rest in
peace...head on collision) and they worked great and I did not have to take
the lenses off to get to the bulb.
