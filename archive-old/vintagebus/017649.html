The rate has varied a hair since mid-Tuesday
afternoon. It was 105.84 / YEN prices = USD price.

Check out the bug tent link at the bottom. Scroll to
the bottom of that and click on &quot;mapion&quot; button. That
link takes you to photo of tasty looking nug-shrooms
on a tidy little bed of baby's breath. WTF! that's
proof that they have all the cool buses and can trip
out at the same time. Pffft! hahaha I'll stick to the
Portebellos, thanks. More spaghetti Mr. VanBondo?
&quot;Hey'll yes! Lay it on me, baby!&quot; ;-)

The white westy with the wooden screen door was FS on
VWPlanet late last week for what $6800? It calcs out
on this site at $21k and change...
