Subject: Re: [VB] Hazard lights on the '60 DC?

Not sure about the &quot;proper&quot; location but I saw, quite a few years ago, a slick ashtray that had a lid that incorporated a lighter to the left of the flip open top. If memory serves me correctly it was chrome and all one piece. I wish I had a pic!

BTW, Anyone have one of those dash emergency lights they would be willing to part with? I need one for the wet bar!
