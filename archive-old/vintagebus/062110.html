Subject: H4s

Well I splurged yesterday and got some H4 headlight assemblies for the '66.

Nate beat me to it though and has a good write up:
http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw/h4_install/

I got the EMPI units that are really rebadged AutoPal units that are made in
India.  Mmmmm, quality Indian metal. LOL!  They did come with new bulbs
which is a bonus.  They were $13.50 each, so I cannot complain about
draining the wallet, and in my opinion a great deal.

Of course they are cheap cruddy made parts with horrible Indian metal so
they did need a little help with the bulb retention hardware to fit/clip
better.  But other than that just drop in parts in exchange for the sealed
beam headlights.

The light is definitely brighter than the sealed beams with a wider beam
pattern!  They come with 55/65 low/high wattage bulbs, which can easily be
dumped in favor of more powerful bulbs as well :)  Even kwel ricer bling
bling colors are available...  Maybe I should take the 100 watt H1s out of
the 911 and put them on the bus.  &lt;hee hee hee&gt;  But highly illegal.   

Of course it was dark out when reassembling the units and I crossed the
parking light wires... SZZZZTT-FFFFF &lt;smoke&gt;...  I was too pissed to even
curse about it, that is when you know you are really miffed!  It looks like
there will be no passenger parking light for a while :(  Well I might fix it
tonight if I have time, it is fairly easy.  Just be careful and take your
time; I was tired, it was wet out, and I had bad lighting = stupid
mistake... Wondering why the fuse did not blow as well..?

Anyway it is a worthwhile upgrade if you ask me.

Take Care,
Adrian S. Pillow
