&lt;&lt; Will using a high pressure spray on the front end do any harm? Like 
getting water into any fittings. I'm about to replace some steering 
components, and would like to first clean off all the caked-on grease and 
crud under there. Any suggestions on cleaners? Engine degreaser? Brake 
cleaner? Dish soap? I'm a little concerned about rinsing all this toxic stuff 
down the storm drains and into the ocean.
 
 Thanks,

I say go for it and make it nicer to work on the bus.  I spray liberally with 
simple green, wait an hour at least,  and go to the self service car wash  to 
rinse it off (not on my driveway!!!! they have filters and stuff)  Well, I do 
that on the engine compartment (watch out for paper hoses and the 
distributor) but haven't on steering, I have chipped of crud with a 
screwdriver, you might do that first on your driveway, sweep it up, spray 
with simple green, then go to the carwash.  couldn't hurt.

yes you could get water in there, but just lube it up after you do your 
steering work,  Seems every time I grease my bus water comes out, thats about 
every 3K miles, it rains here and water splashes up.
