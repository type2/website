Emmet,

Sorry to hear about your day, we've all been there at one time or another.
Get in line to buy one of those NEW 1600's that Ronnie has at
www.type2parts_dot_com.
$1,000.00 and you're in business, sell a kidney or somethin, (unless of
course you've only got one, I need to be careful, last week I told a guy to
pick up the phone only to find out he was deaf, the time before that I told
some guy he could barely put a sentance together only to discover he was
French-Canadian...and apparently a pretty cool guy after all....you never
who's gonna be readin this.....).
John
