Interesting.  I've never had much problem on either side, with the
stock arrangement (bolts in from the front, nuts on the rear, FIF).
Well, I did have problems on the left when I had a gas heater, but
that was slightly-incorrect installation of the heater's fault.

The way I've done it is A) make sure the threads are clean on all
parts involved (chase'em with a tap&amp;die), B) lay a long wrench or
screwdriver across the top of the tranny to give the bolts a little
encouragement to stay in place, C) gently start the nuts.

There are some assumptions here, of course:

- you can get your hand down to where the bolts come through into the
  engine compartment (bent or incorrect tin will have a major impact
  on this; a doghouse cooler makes things a bit more difficult on the
  left, but not that much)
- you have the half-moon bolts, or a welded-on tab as described by
  Thom (a half-inch of nail works *really* well, but the half-moons
  work fine as long as you don't let the bolt slip forward)
- you take your time

That last point is the most important one.  I've gotten standard bolts
(no tab, no half-moon) to work in a pinch.  The hard parts for me have
been that my arms are relatively short (I end up hugging the engine a
bit), and tightening the nuts down after getting them started.
Finding the nut with the wrench is hard, because the wrench doesn't
have very good endings.  But, if you've gotten the nut sufficiently
started, so that it doesn't fall off, it just takes patience.
