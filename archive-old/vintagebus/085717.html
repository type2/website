Subject: Bus Depot Hiring Again

The Bus Depot is looking for phone reps and shipping clerks here in the
metropolis of Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania (roughly between Philadelphia,
Alentown, and Reading).  Full and part time, permanent and summer openings
are available. Pay is entry level, but we do offer benefits (and VW parts at
cost). VW knowledge helps but isn't necessary (if you don't have it, we'll
start you off boxing orders or taking orders by part number while you
learn). Please email me directly, or email sales_at_busdepot_dot_com with ATTN: RON
in the subject line.  If anyone cares to forward this to other VW lists or
forums (or to someone they think might be interested), by all means please
pass it on.
