&gt; I have to get my front shift rod out of the way so I can take care of
&gt; the center pin. Like everyone else, the coupler set pin that holds the
&gt; coupling in place is broken off and rusted in place.

The set screw can be drilled thru (carefully) and removed. Since you said
that you have good access to it, start with a small bit, and go up in
sizes very gradually until you are just inside the thread's ID. Be sure to
center the initial  hole carefully. You can do this by using a center
punch on the screw - you may need to file the top of the screw flat as
well, to aid in centering the punch. Also, use cutting fluid or at least
motor oil to lubricate the drilling (speeds the work, saves the bits).

When you are close to the thread size, you can pry the mess out - use
penetrating oil at this point to help dissolve rust.

good luck,
