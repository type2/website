JP tooled into Havasu last night in his 55 C#_at_vy panel van pulling an auto
trailer with the Captain America DD panel on it (my compliments to Jon's
body work) on his way to RB/KP. It was a site to see, a truck older then the
bus it was towing. You thought driving a bus was slow, how bout 45 mph for
576 miles with another 800 to go. JP left here around 5:30 this morning to
continue his journey and I just got a phone call from VW Howard around 7
this morning with the info he was just leaving for RB/KP. He should be
passing JP in an hour or so, unless he takes a different route on another
bus hunt. I plan on hitting the road around 3 this afternoon. There is a
planned meeting and sleeping stop in Mohave at the only truck stop there,
where we are hoping on meeting up with a few more buses on there way up
north, this might turn into a nice busavan to RB/KP.
