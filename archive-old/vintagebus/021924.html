&lt;&lt; Is this crewcab listed for sale a binz?  maybe looks like it to me.  I
 noticed what looks to be wider rear passenger compartment windows and
 the uneven shapes to the gate indents.   &gt;&gt;

No.  Windows in the picture are standard size.  Binz windows are much more
rectangular - half again as long.
