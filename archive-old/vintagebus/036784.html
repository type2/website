I have a wrecked super beetle with brand new tires on it. They are the 15 in

stock 4 lug wheels. My bus has the 14in 5 lug wheels. I would really like

the new tires on my bus since my funds are limited right now. Can I get 4

lug drums that fit the bus and take beetle rims? Or do I need to try to get

15 in bus rims. Changing drums would be the easiest it seems but Im not sure

if it works. I know beetle drums are too small. How hard is it to find the

15 in bus rims? HELP!
  == = =  ==
you can get adaptors to put other rims on a bus.  but, you know what, the 
165R 15 tires that are generally used on bugs are sort of narrow for a bus.  
Yes you can put them on 15&quot; bus rims.

   Or you can even fid some rims from an early bug (64? 68?and earlier) which 
have the same wide 5 pattern as the bus, and put them on them.    Which would 
be the easiest way to go.

   no they are not as nice on a bus as the LTs, but better than cracked worn 
tires of imminent destruction.   Dont toss your bus rims, cause you can get 
new tires later, and it will ride nicer with bus size tires than with bus 
ones.
