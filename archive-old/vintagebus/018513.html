There is a place in houston called &quot;hardwood lumber&quot;. I beleive one of the
larger lumber importers I have ever encountered.
They sell the 5x5 baltic birch from russia, rather good prices, and they ship
anywhere. I don't have any web info for them, but their phone number is
713-862-6628. If you need help getting in touch with them let me knowvia
p-mail.

There is also boulter plywood in somerville, massachusetts, just outside
boston. They also ship anywhere. I am pretty sure they sell the baltic birch
too. they have a website...www.boulterplywood_dot_com.
