hey camper fans,
        i was in a r.v. store over the weekend and was amazed to see the
sundial,e-z,style(american) crank-out windows (complete)are still available!!!
also all the sink hardware,etc.etc.for the american conversions campers are
still available!! thay even sold the little aluminum rain gutters separately
in many sizes! so you amercan conversions owners can buy new windows if you
desire. they were $44.95 complete(one window,thay also offered two pane
style).the rain gutters (22&quot;)were $2.95ea!! the water tanks are standard
rv.,sink pumps(the rocket),hoses,curtain rails,etc.etc...
        woody
       &quot;keep on pushin'&quot;


&gt; &gt; Were Riviera's the only campers to sport the long horizontal window
&gt; running
&gt; &gt; down the length of the bus on the driver's side just aft of the driver's
&gt; &gt; door?
&gt; &gt; I'm asking because I just saw some pics of a sundial interior, and it
&gt; looks
&gt; &gt;----------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    Alot of the campers have the same type of interior and even similar
&gt; windows. This is due mostly because there are only a few companies that
&gt; make conversion equipment. I used to do conversions on Dodge vans. All of
&gt; the stuff came from Elkhart, IN. Most of the other conversion companies got
&gt; their stuff from the same place. The difference in one conversion company
&gt; from the other is mostly layout and accessories. So odds are, different
&gt; 'American' campers from the same year probably look very similar.
