&gt;Nope. South Africa. But your question got me thinking. Australia and
&gt;S.A. have got fairly similar climates overall with some desert and
&gt;semi-desert parts getting really hot in the summer so the double airflow
&gt;deal was probably a hot climate spec.
&gt;
&gt;That doesn't really work though cause there are large parts of the U.S.
&gt;that get as hot.
&gt;


We recently learned of extra over the cab air intakes with no louvers for OZ
trucks, and now in SA we find they had additional air ducts in the gates.
The Aussie version was probably more for dust than heat, like the high
mounted louvers on their buses. A possible explanation why such
modifications weren't carried out on US spec trucks was that they were far
more common in coastal area than in the inland. Most of the population
centers in out desert areas are not near the shipping ports where the VW's
acceptance was largest in the 50's/60's. The buying public just didn't
require dust or heat mods. You could probably have gotten it if you had
known to ask for it. Well, that's what I think anyway.
