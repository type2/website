Any off road supply house would have the pulley in varying sizes, McKenzies,
Penhall, German Auto, Howe steering, Ump (united machine products) etc., you
see a lot of off road cars run power steering from various manufactures who
use different pumps, so have different pump speeds so they will have
different size pulleys, these are available in billet steel or aluminum and
also cast iron, I have used all 3 and they all work slick, average price 25
to 50 dollars and you need a type 3 pulley bolt or they can supply you with
a custom one, also in checking on something else I was informed of a duel
alt/gen pulley, these were mentioned as being used to run an aux. trans
cooling pump. Also found an inexpensive set of rear disc brakes, will put
these on the DD to test, small nut only, with or without e brake to go along
with my prototype front disc.

WOW,

Must be a real knee breaker for the passenger. OTOH you could have a
machine shop make a double pulley for your from a block of aluminum.
Expensive. How about a long belt that goes all the way around both the
generator and the compressor pulleys?  There might be enough wrap.
Good luck,
Chris

&gt; Here's a good pic of the under dash unit.

&gt;
&gt; Does Anyone have any ideas to how I can get a pulley to run the
&gt; compressor?  I would love to get the AC working.
