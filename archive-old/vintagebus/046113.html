I paid the guy $130 for this set including shipping from germany, which came 
to about $30. He said he had more of them, I could try to find his card if 
anyone is interested. I found him through an ad on vw planet (thanks 
Everet!). I didnt even know the aftermarket seals are bad, so I'm no help 
there. any thoughts on wether these are replacement glass or meant for the 
later buses?

well, the brasiabuses have corner windows.    they made more of those than 63 
and earlier deluxe corner window buses and much more recently.    does seem 
physically the same glass?   I had the impression that the brasilia buses 
used the same corner windows as the 63 and earlier deluxes, but have not been 
able to actually compare closely.    hey, you have the glass and the bus-  
are they the same size and shape?

I am not saying the aftermarket seals are bad, just that the original german 
seals came molded.  I have one NOS corner window seal and it is molded- will 
seal better than a seal that comes as a circle.  And be easier to install.  
real molded seals are real nice to use.
