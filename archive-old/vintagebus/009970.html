Subject: T4 manifolds arrived

I got a deal (or so I thought) on some manifolds for a T4 engine.  They will
work on Porsche or VW heads.  The guy said they would work for 40IDF's but
look to me like they are definitely bigger and would be more suitable for 44
or 48 Webers.  Maybe I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for a set of these
carbs.  Hmmmm....

Anyway, I gave $35 for the pair and thought it was a good price.
