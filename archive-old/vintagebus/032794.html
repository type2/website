Subject: Re: [VB] Spark Plugs on a Dual Carb
To: chuck.jan_at_cyberdude_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

You could hire Katie....=)  We've had to have the rear plugs on our last 2 
camping trips to deal with leaking carbs.  With the air cleaner off (Weber 42 
DCNF's) she can reach her hand back there with a spark plug socket and a 
swivel head ratchet.  She has LONG skinny arms though.  I dont think I could 
get back there without taking the carb off .

I'm sure John Howard could get right to his dual carbs if he had them with 
that type 3 engine lid over his engine compartment.  We'll make that 
conversion someday.
