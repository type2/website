&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; whats a binz, like the history of, etc.
 
 Well, recently it seem to be a VERY overpriced VW truck! &gt;&gt;

I don't think so.  Of course I could be totally wrong but I think the Binz is 
actually undervalued right now.  

Bottom line on &quot;value&quot; is supply and demand.  The supply of Binz is 
incredibly low.  After looking for 3 years I have found only 12 Binz and some 
of those are in junkyards.  I would bet there are fewer Binz out there than 
there are Hebmeullers.  We all know that busses are *way* cooler than bugs 
(even if it is a Heb) so then why isn't the Binz price equal to the Heb?  
Because *right now* there is a lack of demand for the Binz. 

I think the lack of demand is due to lack of knowledge.  You can't want 
something you don't know exists.   I can't tell you how many times at a show 
I have been asked &quot;How long did it take you to make that?&quot; by folks who have 
been in the Volkswagen hobby for several years.  They don't know what it is.  
Not very many people know about the Binz.  To my knowledge there aren't any 
Binz out there that are restored and/or shown on a regular basis to increase 
the awareness of them.    The only article I have seen on a Binz printed in 
the last 20 years was a 1992 article in VW Trends on a customized Binz.  The 
text of the article was completely inaccurate BTW.  

Along with the great info available on DropGates_dot_com and TheSamba_dot_com, my 
guess is within the next few years someone will restore a Binz, show it, get 
it in a feature article in one of the big VW rags and the awareness will go 
up.  As the awareness goes up and so will the demand and the price.  While 
the Binz may not reach the price of the Heb, last Heb I saw advertised was 
$70K, it should be dramatically more than what they are going for today.  
Hell, there are deluxe busses selling for $20K - $30K+ on a regular basis and 
there are 1,000's of them out there.  With only 12 or so Binz out there the 
Binz should be in that range at a minimum.

Based on what I know about the Hebmueller I think a solid, complete, 
original, project Binz at $15K or a running and driving Binz at $7800 aren't 
at all out of line.   On a personal note, I sold a very nice &quot;finished&quot; '63 
crew cab to get my Binz.  I felt lucky to get it when I did at the price I 
did.   I can't see how the Binz could do anything but go up in value.  Get'em 
while there available or a few years from now you could be talking about the 
&quot;Hebmueller of Busses&quot; that got away.
