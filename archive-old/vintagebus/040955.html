Subject: BusDepot schedule this week

Importance: Normal

I am back home as of Monday.  However, over the weekend, Jerry (who handles
our email) had a death in the family, which will keep him out of the shop
during parts of this week and also all day Friday.   This means that you may
experience delays in email response this week, particularly from Thursday
afternoon (all email sent after Thursday pm will be read on the following
Monday).

The delays this week will be in email response only.  It will NOT affect
online orders, which will continue to be processed as always - although if
you have an expedited order such as a next-day, second-day, etc. it may be
prudent to call it in this week rather than emaling it. It also will NOT
affect calls to the shop. All in-store operations (phone lines etc) continue
as always, so if you need a fast response you can always call (or email me
directly at busdepot_at_email_dot_com if the issue requires my personal attention)

On a somewhat unrelated issue, I made the mistake of trying to check my
email with an unfamiliar email browser while out of town.  I did pretty well
but it crashed just as I opened one particular email, deleting it before I
read it.  The subject header was &quot;order number xxxx&quot; or something quite
similar, and it was sent Friday evening.  If you happen to have sent that
email, could you possibly resend it?

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
