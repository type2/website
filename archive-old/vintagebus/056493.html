Subject: RE: [VB] MORE on the Clutch Spring

By the lever, there are two diff styles, one almun with rubbershish
grooved bushes, another with a brass collar, no other fun stuff. There
are about 4-5 different arms.
The bushing should be flush against the case. Hammering is a no no.
Perhaps you have some of that alumn thin stlye jammed in there?
I do not remember if the bushing is asymeterical. It might be that is
the issue.
I have also seen and arm with more than one place to put the inner c
clip.
Basically you should have small bushing in pass side, greased, greased
arm. Inner clip, bushing, cover/collar, spring, arm, clip, then mount
spring.
If you use the new style with the alumninum and the rubber bushes, one
goes inside, one goes outside.
Make certain the screw is in the hole for the bushing, not bashing into
it, and put that in tight last, I left mine in just a littl eto prevent
bushing from moving while installing, then ran it home.
Sounds like you need a new bushing. Bus Boys hooked me up with the
pre-63 style brass hefty one, and the HD throwout lever. The only other
thing is to make certain the arm is correct, and in the right attitude.

Ok volks, I STILL haven't gotten that friggen spring on and because I
consider you all good friends I feel I can confide in you.  That damn
thing got away from me and thunked  me in the forehead over my right
eye.  I have a heck of a welt now highlighted by a grease streak.  Other
than my wife laughing at me there is no love in the house right now. Now
on to some other biddnes.  I'm looking at bushing that goes next to the
arm (the one held in place by the screw and it seems to long.  It sticks
out to far to the right.  The retention clip can not make it into it's
grove.  I have banged the shite out of the lever and she won't go any
further (story of my life).  Now the bushing that came out was only half
the size of the new one.  Me thinks this may be a new and improved
version but maybe it's the wrong version.  My tranny is a 6 volt ground
out for a 12 volt flywheel.  Are there two different bushings for 6 and
12 volt versions?  I'm going to go drink beer and hold the bottle
against my eye now.

I installed a new clutch lever and now I'm trying to get the spring back
on.  Is there a trick to this because so far this task has been a pain
in the arse.  TIA!
