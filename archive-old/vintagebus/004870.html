Ron, if I'm not mistaken, rules regarding private import of cars has changed
dramatically lately. At this time you can import most anything that has not
been mass imported to the US before. ohhhh! but Bus was imported, but would
you be able to get around this since it's a NEW! water-cooled bus?

It'll be cool.

Subject: [VB] Back from Mexico- Drove a 2000 VW Kombi!


&gt; Well, I'm back from my trip to Mexico.  I won't bore you with details. Was
a
&gt; combination of business and pleasure, the latter diminished greatly by two
&gt; consecutive flight cancellations, followed by the loss of all of our
&gt; luggage, not to mention that our 2 year old daughter got the flu one day
&gt; into the trip.  Fortunately the second half of the trip was much better
than
&gt; the first, and I'm sitting here in 20-degree Pennsylvania with a suntan so
I
&gt; can't complain too much!
&gt;
&gt; One of the high points of the trip was my first opportunity to drive a
&gt; nearly new (2000 model year) Brazilian made watercooled Kombi!  For those
&gt; unfamiliar with it, the Mexican/Brazilian Kombi is a '68-79 era bus body
&gt; with an inline watercooled Golf engine. Rumor has it that it may soon go
the
&gt; way of the old Beetle in South America once production of the T4
(&quot;Eurovan&quot;)
&gt; there gears up.
&gt;
&gt; The bus looks very similar to the '73-79 German busses, except with a
black
&gt; radiator grill on the front. (I took a few digital pictures and will try
to
&gt; get them up soon; or find the Brazilian VW website if you're curious.)
The
&gt; roof of ours was slightly raised with a small fiberglass extention to
&gt; increase headroom (a factory fitted feature).  The dash looked more like a
&gt; Golf dash than a Bus one, with headlight switches etc. that were obviously
&gt; from a Golf. I couldn't get used to seeing a water temp gauge and &quot;real&quot;
&gt; heater controls on it! :-)  The seating inside was plusher than on an old
&gt; bus (gray cloth and matching panels, contoured seats, and headrests; &quot;our&quot;
&gt; Kombi had a 1/3 - 2/3 front seat, 3 person middle seat whose end flipped
&gt; forward for access to the rear, and 3 person rear seat). Bumpers were
kinda
&gt; neat looking, black plastic &quot;wraparounds&quot; that resemble the ones used on
the
&gt; '88-91 Vanagons here in the states.  Mirrors (much larger than German bus
&gt; ones), door handles, etc. were also black.  Lots of little differences
&gt; compared to a German bus, such as Golf style hatch struts holding up the
&gt; rear hatch, an upper engine compartment hatch that latched from the inside
&gt; rather than from the top, etc. I have to admit that with well under 10,000
&gt; miles on it, though, the Kombi already had its share of dash rattles,
&gt; falling-off trim parts, etc.  I certainly would have been unhappy if our
New
&gt; Beetle were like that at 10k miles.  But to be fair, it was a rental (thus
&gt; not kindly treated by some people), and some of the roads in Mexico are
not
&gt; too kind either.
&gt;
&gt; The Kombi had noticably more power than its aircooled cousin (even
compared
&gt; to the later ones with the 2 liter aircooled engine).  In fact, it seemed
&gt; about as powerful as my '89 Westy despite the smaller engine size
(remember,
&gt; it weighs much less too).  Acceleration was smooth and responsive. I
easily
&gt; passed trucks on the highway (on level ground) - a new experience to me
when
&gt; driving a Bus! :-)  It was odd, though, to hear the &quot;wooshing&quot; sound of a
&gt; Golf engine in the back, rather than the familiar tick-tick-tick of an
&gt; aircooled engine. But while the power was like that of a Vanagon, the
&gt; handling was very similar to a late model Bus. It was more easily
wind-blown
&gt; than a Vanagon (higher center of gravity), and had the typical Bus feel in
&gt; the front end (very tight, perhaps less &quot;mushy&quot; than a Vanagon; you &quot;felt&quot;
&gt; the road more for good and for bad).  So, predictably, the overall feel
was
&gt; that of driving a bus that had the power of a watercooled Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt; I was surprised at how easily the Golf engine fit into the Bus engine
&gt; compartment, with a ton of room to spare.  It looked like you could have
fit
&gt; an engine 25% larger in there if you tried. Some of the parts in the
engine
&gt; compartment were immediately recognizeable as Vanagon parts, such as the
&gt; coolant overflow and recovery tanks (both the same as on a Vanagon, and
&gt; German made). Exhaust system was very straight forward and non-catalyst.
&gt;
&gt; I want one!  Too bad you can't import them to the U.S.
