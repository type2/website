&gt; HA HA!!!  That was `94 and not to many folks into
&gt; those things.

Force wasn't the problem. Money was. Paula and I had
driven out from Phoenix in my '57 single cab that
broke on the way which put Mr.Transrest through hell
just to find an alternator pulley in the middle of the
desert half way between Phoenix and LA. Poor ol' Doug
and his buddy drove 100 miles round trip to find one
for us~ in 100+ degree heat. While they were gone I
went across the freeway looking for drinking water
etc. and found a hidden yard full of dune buggies and
old buses! I felt off balance and sheepish for the
rest of that trip. While at that show we found/smelled
seeping gas while sitting on the lawn. I ended up
changing a gas tank bib after the show with a full gas
tank while I laid under the bus! I thought that my
early reserve petcock had gone FUBAR on me. I got
drenched! You could imagine what I smelled like
afterwords. Later found a pin hole leak in the
non-guage tank...
We were real short on the money and pretty
**clueless** as to what was proper for the 67. I
figured in my ignorance that a stupid old used 35 year
old tent should be around $50-100. or so. I didnt want
to get &quot;ripped off&quot; for $190. for gosh sakes!!! ;-)
SOB didnt even have a floor. We were in the midst of
the endless/infamous Resto from Hell and didnt know
prices from beans. Like Todd said, No one was into
campers per se at that time. We only picked the Westy
because we liked to camp. Gawd what an education THAT
was! $190.00 was a huge amount of money to us. In fact
is again. =) Funny what babies due to budgets huh?
