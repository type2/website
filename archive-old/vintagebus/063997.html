Hi Kevin, I can't tell if you're kidding but I'll assume you're not.

I think you should start one called &quot;I can't tolerate individuality or
free thought&quot;. I even took the effort out of finding a good logo:

Why not start a mailing list called &quot;Vintagebus, well not really&quot; or
&quot;Vintagebus, but I really wanted a Civic&quot; ?

Let me start with I ENJOY this group and get tons of help from it.  But
I hate when this comes up, lowering.  Everyone wants to jump in with
keep it stock.  You know what, it's there's, my money, and we (I) should
be able to do it like we want and still get opinions.  Isn't that what
owning a driving Buses are about, being different then everyone else?
