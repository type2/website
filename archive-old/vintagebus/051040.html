Subject: Re: [VB] pre 60 wire termination... Poll

&gt; that all wires were not terminated with those little brass ends.... sure
&gt; sure, I knew that.

Do these little brass ends make a difference? And are they &quot;better&quot; than
just terminating the wire with a good solder job? I wrestled with this when
I put in my new harness, but finally gave up when I couldn't find any
locally. Seems like the least amount of material the current has to go
through, the better, but I have absolutely NO electrical background so I'll
just shut up now.

Thanks,
