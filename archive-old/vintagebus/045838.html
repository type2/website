&lt;&lt; My 1965 Microbus went from fine one day to dead ignition switch and no 
lights the next. Jumped the starter and once it was running, got lights.  
What gives, guru's? How come no lights without it running? Any ideas on how 
to fix the wiring without re-creating the problem? &gt;&gt;
Hi Kenny,
Sounds like time for a complete going though all the electrical connections, 
cleaning each, and every one.  Those bypass relays are just a bandaid that 
allow the electrical system (Especially lights, wipers, and signals.) to get 
worse, and worse.    Eric&amp;Barb
