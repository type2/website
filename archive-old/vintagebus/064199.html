&gt; &gt; &gt; ?  I hope that this is not the case, the dash
&gt; &gt; &gt; board has already been cut to allow a rectangular (DIN chassis) radio,

&gt; &gt; I was told that 1967 dashes came with the larger dash hole. I am certain
&gt; &gt; someone will confirm or deny this. I would post you pictures of my
dash/turn
&gt; &gt; signal switch but its away being painted. Mel 67 Samba

 Correct, 67 dashes are pre-cut with a rectangular hole.
But they are smaller than DIN size radios.....
DIN is approx 180mm x 50mm with square corners.
The 67 opening is 179mm x 45mm with round radius corners.
A DIN radio will not fit..... BTDT.
