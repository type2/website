Subject: Single Cab Canvas Questions

As some of you are aware I have been fabricating a Hoops and canvas for my
66 SC so as to have to drive to the Classic in June.  Here is my question.
On the place where the canvas comes over and attaches to the truck gates how
big is the pieces of leather that are there.  Can anyone with a digital
camera and a single cab with hoops and canvas please lay a ruler next to the
attachment leather and snap a pic or if no camera could you maybe take
measurements Of the leather strap that hangs down and the leather that is
like the button hole.  Is there leather on both sides of the button hole?.
Also I need a pic of the piece that holds the canvas when it is rolled up.
All that I could find are too far away and unable to make a guess on there
measurements.  Thanks to a great bunch.
See you Left coasters in a little over a month
Classic Bound from TDC of the USA on the beginning of the month
