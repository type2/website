Subject: RE: [VB] 21 window shirt

Can't tell if you are complaining about cyclists,but if you are not good.I
can say you can thank cyclists for paved roads.Being a bus driver you should
understand about slow vehicles.When riding we often get buzzed by cars and
harrased often,if bad enough we have been know to chase the offender down
and confront them.Hint a full watter bottle will go through the rear window
of a car.

From the LAB webiste  http://www.bikeleague_dot_org/about/index.html

A PROUD AND RICH HISTORY 

The League was founded as the League of American Wheelmen in 1880.
Bicyclists, known then as &quot;wheelmen&quot;, were challenged by rutted roads of
gravel and dirt and faced antagonism from horsemen, wagon drivers, and
pedestrians. 

In an effort to improve riding conditions so they might better enjoy their
newly discovered sport, over 100,000 cyclists from across the United States
joined the League to advocate for paved roads. The success of the League in
its first advocacy efforts ultimately led to our national highway system.

I figured it was one of those. I do hope no one near me gets it though.
Those cats are out every weekend taking up half the road and If I saw that I
might just lean in for a closer look!
