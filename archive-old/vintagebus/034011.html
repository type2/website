&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever done this conversion on a single or double cab?  I'm 
wondering if you can get the tank in there given the &quot;bar&quot; on the bottom of 
the floor.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
Yes, we did this last week to our 1963 SC and it fitted with no problems.  We 
made sure to cut the original tank neck so it would end up 1-1/2&quot; longer than 
stock so it would stick up higher and before installing the neck we finely 
polished the arear the fuel cap seals to.  So far it seems to help prevent 
fuel leakage!  With a 6 volt system and gauge, the late model sender works 
quite accurately.   Eric&amp;Barb
