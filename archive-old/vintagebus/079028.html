Subject: Re: [VB] continuing saga of 61

Yea, I remember 6 years ago this list was hopping with action. I had my
email disconnected for a week and a half while I moved from apartment to
house back then and I came back to almost 1500 emails since I didn't cancell
VB during that time. Seems like we were getting over 100 VB emails per 24hr
period back then. It was awesome.

Man, that took a long time with my old dial-up connection. haha

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the updates on all your work. You're almost
&gt; &gt; single-handedly keeping this list alive.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Yes,

&gt; That is my impression also. WTF? is going on?
