You do now!

I only knew about it because I put a date in my calendar
this year from info in last year's calendar!  The date got
close, so I did some digging.

The publicity about this show is/has been pathetic.
It's not listed on Type 2 show list, nor did a search of 
the net provide much either other than a phone number.
I didn't notice it in the upcoming shows in either VW rag.

VW Trends is one of the sponsors, along with Volks
Motorsports, so the Vanagon list probably knows from
Kyle's posts, but nobody else.

They are having an 'other' imports show on Sunday, so
you may see ads for both days.  The important stuff
happens Saturday, you know the REAL important stuff,
like bikini blow and engine strut stuff, the REAL reason
we all go to these shows, not.

I'd like to see demos of 'how-to-do' things, how NOT to
do things, a line-up of the different year thingys.  
I want to go away with more knowledge than
what I came with, not just what is available to buy.
But then again, with this list, I get that knowledge.

Jeff
