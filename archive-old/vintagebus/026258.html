&lt;&lt;It's actually worse than this - some counties/towns have a law that
says
non-running and/or non-registered cars can be hauled off to the crusher
(after 'reasonable efforts to contact owner'), EVEN IF THE VEHICLE IS ON

PRIVATE LAND. So much for finds like Thom's......&gt;&gt;

If they made the complaint in writing, as is required in my
jurisdiction, you may also make a freedom of information act request and
get a copy of the original complaint, as I did. I have been sitting on
it for six months, but one day when I get time, I intend on spending a
day in the county courthouse searching the land records to find the
butthole who's handwriting matches. Because I think I already know who
turned me in. And his shed is 6 inches on my property. Same with his
concrete driveway. And that yappin dog that I have to listen to
constantly. . . he'll have to take care of that, too.

Personally, if I have a beef with one of my neighbors, I will say
something to them, or at least send them an anonymous letter before I
bring the long arm of the man down on em. But thats just me.
