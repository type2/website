This kinda stuff does NOT belong on the list.

This list is about buses, not software, not hungry kids, - BUSES!

Every now and then a thread strays off topic, and unless it gets  ugly,
or really long-winded, I let it go.

But a flagrant posting about something not even remotely related to
buses, not even VW's, not even *cars*, is unacceptable.

This thread is dead now.  Please don't bother to comment, the thread filter
is already in place.

Thank you.
