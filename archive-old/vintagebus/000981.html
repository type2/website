Hi Tom,

The part number is 221.841.505A.  I had been asking people earlier for part
#221.841.605D but that was from my '59 parts book.

Any thoughts???

David
59 double cab #469869


What's the part #? There's different versions, suffixed with a A, B, etc.
59
was a changeover year for that piece; *my* 60 has the early style; it's
brother
did not.

&gt; My rear passenger door lock mechanism in my 59 double cab is shot...  The
&gt; part that the handle goes through with the square hole in it is wore out
and
&gt; wobbles around.  The rest of the parts look OK.  The latches I have found
&gt; all have the little lock lever on it.  Mine does not.  Does anyone know if
I
&gt; could get one of these other mechanism and scavenge internal parts from
&gt; it???
