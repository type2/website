Well, everybody for themselves. I wasn't talking about the paint job but if
you really dig deep into some Bus history you'll find lots of these around.
Flower Power baby. I have seen a Bay in my area not too long ago with
flowers all over and Peace and Flower Power and you know what I mean. Not
every bus should be the same. It looks like this baby has been through a lot
in it's earlier days. I said save it as to save the bus from a crusher and
just keep it on the road. I think it's understandable and nobody else
complained. I know we all hate these &quot;crazy&quot; pain jobs but it's actually the
owners call. Later, when they want to sell they might have a problem but for
now, it's their baby.

Keep'em rolling.

&gt; I don't know what I was thinking. Let me correct myself. If the bus was
owned
&gt; by a florist then I think it would be suitable for it to have &quot;some&quot;
flowers
&gt; on the side.
