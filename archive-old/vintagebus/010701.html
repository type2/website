 &lt;&lt; i could use a deck lid too. anyone know what the repop deck lids or 
  aprons look like? &gt;&gt;
 
 
 They look like nothing that came with the bus, its a mix of late and early 
 decklid combined.

they fit a split- a guy who had put one on a bus was telling me yesterday 
that they dont have the bit for attaching the liscence plate light- he used a 
bay light that was attached to the lens, the bay one worked/fit perfectly.   
But although it isn't exactly the same, its nice to know you can get 
something. tinny or something though?
