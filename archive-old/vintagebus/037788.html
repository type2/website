all this tent talk brings up the fact that i have a barely used awning for sale, made by the vwcanvas guy, it comes with the bag, poles, rope, stakes, it was sewn in a custom color and is mostly a denim blue, with yellow and white bands and thin red pin strips. it fits ok on  split but fits better on a bay or vanagon. i paid $200 plus shipping, but will sell for $125 firm. very good quality, and a good deal, it self mounts to the rain gutters with no drilling, I won't ship it but I will be at the vintage meet in Seattle on saturday the 17th. pmail for a photo.

i know, i know its not friday,

ty
