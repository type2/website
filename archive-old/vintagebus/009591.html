Todd,
This location is a badddd place to put a temperature gauge.  It's great for
pressure, but if you are going to put a temp gauge there, remember it's
hanging way out in the breeze, isolated by a tee, and has hardly any real
contact with oil.  This thread has gone around a bit not too long ago and
there are several locations for a sender that are much better such as the
dipstick,
pressure relief valve, or sump drain.  Unfortunately your rabbit sender
probably won't work in those places, but senders should be pretty cheap, but
I don't know if they would be compatible with your gauge.  I would think
they'd be pretty close.  You'd have to check the calibration at any rate.

John

Hi guys..

Has anyone ever tried to install a Rabbit VDO oil temperature gauge and
sender into an upright VW engine?  I plan on doing that to my `63 Camper
with a SP 1600.  I have a good working gauge and sender out of a `79
rabbit...I am told with a T-fitting I can install the Rabbit sender at
the stock idiot oil light....
