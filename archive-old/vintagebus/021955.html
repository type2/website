&lt;&lt; I pulled the speaker out and noticed that it had some form of screen in 
front of it... was this from the factory or had the last owner put window 
screen in front of the speaker to keep trash out?  What is supposed to be 
there? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Since antennas and radios were dealer not factory installed for US delivery 
the same applies to the speaker.  On the otherhand as a dealer installation 
the black speaker cloth would have come in the radio kit.   Eric&amp;Barb
