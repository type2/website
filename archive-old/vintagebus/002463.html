&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Check some local welding shops to get the welding done, they will be
cheaper
than letting a body shop do the metal work. After the new parts are welded
on, apply a good 2 component primer to protect the work.

Also Make sure they can do sheetmetal work, rember this is not like welding
a trailer or structural steel, and that they understand fitting panels, not
beating in the side of the bus the capping the panel over it and welding one
solid bead from one side to the other ,, i have seen this , ask doc ric
about it ,,,, if not your gonna wind up with the panels capped over the
rusty crap, and warpage from he** and bondo inches thick, and then you'll
pay for it in the long run, most of the list have seen the chit i get into
and this happens way to often, if the person doing it don't care and is just
after the money, you've had a bad day and just don't know it yet, I'm
personally getting a bit fed up with undoing other peoples screw ups and
trying to explain why it cost so much to redo it  ,,,,its easier to do it
right the first time ,, my .02 cents worth. later

Ps cheaper is not always better, sorry for the venting
