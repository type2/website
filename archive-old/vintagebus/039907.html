Hi there,

I just subscribed to this list as I just bought my first vintage bus.  I do 
have a 63 beetle but never a bus.  I just purchased a 59 Kombi.  I have a 
few questions:

1-is it common to have sliding windows between the front passenger area and 
the back cargo area?

2-the inside metal(as kombi’s don’t have wall panels or headliners, right?) 
is grey.  We were thinking of painting it the same as the outside of the 
bus-dove blue.  Does this lower the value or should we respray it with the 
original grey color?

3-What is a good compression reading for a 36 HP engine.  I think it’s a 
1100 or 1200.

4-Does this bus still need reinforced sidewall tires even if it isn’t a 
camper and a pretty light vehicle in general compared to my 71 campmobile?

Any other tips for this oldie would be great!!
