Hi,

Honestly I think 7 grand is WAY too much for the bus you decribed.  For
comparason, Thom Fitzpatrick posted a bus for a friend to the list, and
then on his site that was fully restored (a real 62' Westy I
think...VERY nice). 
The guy was asking $8500.  This bus was just about perfect as well as
being much rarer (hatch top) than the camper you described.  Think about
it, could you duplicate that bus for another $1500?  I don't think so.  

Besides, an EZ camper will never be as collectable as a Westfalia.Just
my opinion though.  Good luck with what ever you decide to do!

Steve Harris
