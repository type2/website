I got a set of corner windows for my bus that are brand spankin new with  the 
audi logo beside the vw logo. beneath them it says blindex, beneath that it 
says transparencia 75% a 95%
BR (inside a little box)
INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA

would these be newer made replacement glass or maybe for the brazilian 
hybrids?

you're justing posting that to make people jealous.  okay it works.  next 
thing,  what does it cost to get more, and more importantly, can you get the 
proper molded seals for the corner windows?   I have not taken them out of my 
61 even though they are rock like and leak because I am afraid to break the 
sigla curved glass installing with non vw seals.
