First - VW didn't make Westfalias, Westfalia made Westfalias, many of which
were based on VW vans/transporters.

Second - Westfalia conversions of VWs began with early splitties and
continued [continues?] all the way up to Eurovans.

You pay your money and you take your choice [of base vehicle].

&gt;&gt; What years did VW make Westfalias?  I have a fellow who wants to get one
off
his land and I told him I would haul it off for free.  Did they make them
after 67? &lt;&lt;
