Subject: re: [VB] Any Kelly park updates

Per the usual there are no categories for split window buses 50-67. Split to
the VVWCA means TypeI (Beetle). In 97 My 67 Westy was lumped into the Luxury
Class and took Second to Bob Sowersby's 23 window. I guess, if it gets into the
gate I will go heads up against bay windows! I am counting on a show in the
street instead. Looking fwd to fun regardless of what happens. =)
