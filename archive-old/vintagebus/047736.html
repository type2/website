Hi Steve,
You fill to the red line and/or the pressed arrow.  Then when you strat the 
engine the oil with lots of air bubbles gets sucked up into the horse hair in 
the air cleaner.  both oiling the horse hair and breaking the air bubbles in 
the oil into smaller bubbles.  Do use 20Wt. or 20/20Wt. oil.  We use cheap 
Penzoil in our air cleaner and that is as close as we will let that brand 
into our engines!
