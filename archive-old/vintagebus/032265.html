When I repaint MY 55 Westy, I plan on going to the second original paint
scheme. See, my bus was shipped primered and the original owner put the
first paint on it. So, I am going with their color choice which is a
mustard yellow below the beltline and on the roof. Then, in the center and
interior it is a khaki brown/greenish color. I'm debating what to do in the
engine compartment which is currently OG primer. I'll probably just clean
it up a bit.

Yeah, they're ugly colors, but it will look very vintage when it's done. I
also have a plan to reproduce the original fabric pattern for the seats and
curtains using a computer. I've looked for that pattern all over the place
and haven't found one that's even close enough. So, I'll make my own!

I agree with Everett, though...do what makes you happy. As long as you
don't expect to get more for your bus because it has Candy Apple Metal
Flake when you sell it...
