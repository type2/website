I've posted gleaming messages in the past about Gabriel and his lick
wizardry.
The guy is good and has quite the stash of old NOS Bus keys, ignitions,
etc.  At the rate he's going tho, who knows for how much longer.  His mail
business is what I'm familiar with and the turn around was less than 5
days for an ignition, doors, cargos and rear hatch being re-keyed to use
just one key.  What a guy!
later
