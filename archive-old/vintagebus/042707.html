hi all,

on teh way back from Eureka springs i was rear ended...

put a dent in the left rear corner (if you go to my pix page you can see
the rear shot in the first line and second line are before and after pix)

Its not that big a deal i suppose, just another damn dent i have to
remove...

I was just upset as i thought it woudl be much worse than it is...

So, what do you all think, should i claim it or not? cut the scatterbraind
collider some slack or make them pay...

bye,

Steve
