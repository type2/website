Subject: Wheel id

Howdy Volks,

My son and I were driving down the interstate on Saturday when I looked over
on the feeder road and saw where some idiot had dumped out 100 or so tires
and wheels in the brush.  Well we u-turned at the next overpass, and I ended
up digging 6 old VW wheels out of the pile.  Five are 15&quot; and 1 is a 14&quot;
with the drum still bolted on. My question is, does anyone know how to
identify what the 15&quot; go on, Type 1 or Type 2?  Which leads me to the single
cab I bought last weekend, while it has 15&quot; wheels on it now, they are all
different in style.  Any idea what style 15&quot; wheel did early Type 2's had?

Thanks a bunch,
Gary
Round Rock, TX
