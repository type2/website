&lt;&lt;  I checked all the mounts and everything seems tight except for the right 
side rear 27mm bolt that secures the engine mounting plate to the 
chassis(does this make any sense?) This one is sufficiently loose for the 
warpy washer under it to spin freely. Could this be responsible for the clunk 
and what do I torque it to?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
If you mean the 27mm bolts that secure the transmission carrier that holds 
the rear of the tranny from falling, and in turn holds the engine up also 
when bolted to the tranny.  Then that is one of quite a few torque values we 
have not been able to find as of yet.  Though we would guess that 80 ft. lbs. 
would be a good start.
  
&lt;&gt;
72-87ft. lbs., though we would suggest going with the lower value due to any 
wear and tear you inflicted on the internal threads.  This may keep you from 
ending up with a fully stripped hole in your reductions.
  
&lt;&lt;Is it true that a clunk every time power is engaged or disengaged suggests 
loose mounts rather than worn fulcrum plates?(just typing that question has 
given me the cold sweats) &gt;&gt;
The thunk from a loose fastener/s is more a bone deep sounding bang/klang.  
Once you have heard it, and diagnosed it you will always know it from then 
on.  Kind of like being able to diagnos loose heads from the sound produced 
from listening to a hard acceleration from a stop.  Which releases a pounding 
popping noise.
