&lt;&lt;  I especially need to refab the rear passenger area just up from the axle 
tubes..
 Best way to do this it to have the body of the frame.  How difficult is this
 to do, that is raise the body off the frame??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Christian,
The bus is no type 1.  In other words there is no way to just unbolt the bus 
body from it's frame/pan.  Take a look at the web page    
http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/default.htm    and look around.  
Especially this page   http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/page7.htm     
in there shows how the floor sections are replaced.   Eric&amp;Barb
