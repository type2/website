&gt; What do I do first?

Chris,

Check out the Type 2 library (Type2_dot_com) look under interior, headliner
replacement. Great article that guides you through.

Also check the List archives, Dec. 21, 1997, &quot;21 window headliner
install&quot; for more good tips.

Also also, get a copy of the Bentley '63-67 Type 2 manual. Has a few
pictures and a discription of the basic process.It costs a chunk of
change, but it has lots of cool info you can't get elsewhere.

Good luck!

Dave
