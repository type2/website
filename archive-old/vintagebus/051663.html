&lt;&lt;  Please try and not diss me for SAVING 
 another VW from the crusher. &gt;&gt;
-----------------------
er- think John misunderstood me.   I was using his bus as an example of an 
extreme customised bus as compared to a utilitarian workhorse, and said that 
people on any side of the issue can and do get dissed, whether it is stock 
vintage resto or extreme customisation.  guess I should include those with 
ratty unfinished projects as another group who gets dissed too.    And hoopty 
buses....   I am definately evangelical about greasing  buses.  (Grease is 
good.  Your bus loves grease.   Have you greased your bus lately?  the hinges 
should be oiled every 1200 miles.)  Just curious, did anyone really criticise 
you for saving that bus?  or was the criticism for  customising it? 
gee, never had anyone critcise my artistic taste. &lt;joke&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We all have our own way of 
building our VW's.  Can we all just let each other enjoy VW's as a whole no 
matter how we build them!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
=============
that's my point John!
