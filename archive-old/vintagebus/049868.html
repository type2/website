Subject: [VB] Window Rubber [was: The end of day one]
Message-Id: &lt;v03110702b44aa980f590_at_[209.214.196.167]&gt;

&gt;Best quality and easiest installation of the day. Wolfsberg West was the
&gt;very prompt and helpful. One of the seals for the side Windows split and
&gt;they sent me another w/o charge or arguments within 5 working days. I order
&gt;from them whenever possible.

Digressing somewhat: I installed the WCM complete window rubber kit in the
64 about a year ago and I've been trying to solve this since then: the
rubber between the (driver/passenger) doors and the body is amazingly
sticky. The black seal that goes around the top of the door. The doors are
alway stuck shut until you heave on them to a ridiculous degree. This is
really irritating.

Here is what we have tried:

	Wax (JC Johnson Kit Wax Paste)	(made no difference)

	Wax again			(made no difference)

	Special synthetic rubber grease
	from NAPA			(made it worse)

	Powdering with corn starch		(works for a period of days)

	Powdering with flour		(works for a period of hours)

Somehow it is just a bit much to be out in the driveway in the morning
powdering your door seals with a pastry brush. Does anybody have an idea?
