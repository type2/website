The garage is dedicated to VW work and parking the driver car - I wanted as much
elbow room as I could get for working on the cars. I even installed speakers and
routed wires from the stereo in the living room.   I installed a t-bar celing and
7 4-tube light fixtures so I'd have ample lighting.  I also insulated and sheetrocked it,
and have high shelves almost all the way around.
I've  gone to great lengths - and expense - to move as much as I can out of the garage.
I built a small enclosure for my air compressor outside the garage and plumbed
the air into the garage through the wall, so I don't have to listen to the noise.  
My neighbors don't either, as I insulated it with two layers of differnt types of insulation.
I recently built a 10x10 shed in the backyard to house the &quot;rough&quot; stuff,
ie doors, bumpers, engine bits.  Inside the house, I have one bedroom totally given
over to parts storage, with 8' shelves floor to ceiling.
