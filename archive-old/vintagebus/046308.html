Subject: Re: [VB] Mounting an extern oilcooler

I have never done this, but from my understanding it really makes sense.  
That is, if you use an external cooler, to have a thermostat X in it.  That 
way the oil is only routed to the cooler when the oil temp is above 65-70 C 
(~160-170 F)- meaning after it has warmed up.   I saw this set up on a bus in 
the high desert  near the sierra- where there is snow in the winter and ove 
100F temps in the summer- the guy said it worked good fo him, I didn't see 
the thermostat buit he told me about it.   Because, like you say, in the 
freezing winter that last thing you want is extra cooling, or the engine will 
not warm up.

Then again,   what oil temps are you running?  and what have you done to keep 
it running cool?   I remember you writing something a bit ago concerning it 
running hot. 

I know there are those on the list who claim to run 160 F oil temps all day 
long on the freeway in the hot desert, but really dont have oil temp guages 
and are just pulling numbers out of..... the air, and scorn people thinking 
about these things,   though I haven't seen anyone post their oil temps who 
lives and drives in the SW desert.    I do not know if this is because no 
listees there have guages, or perhaps they do not want to say.   maybe it is 
merely a coincedence.    THis is not to say you need guages to drive an old 
bus, I didn't have any for years and years or driving all over.   I just find 
them interesting.  ANd if you are worried about it running hot-   well, when 
you have been driving on the main roads, when you stop does it pass the spit 
test?  can you hold the dipstick?  does openning the engine compartment mean 
a blast of heat like from a furnace or the camp fire we had last night?

do you know what rpms you are running.  It really is true that the engine 
will run hotter at differnt rpms, and seemed to me at 2600-2800 was what I 
found the optimal cooling engine speed is, though of course this is what I 
found on two buses, not a scientific survey.  But the engine ran hotter at 
higher rpms, and also hotter at lower rpms.  ANd it got better gas milage at 
this speed (which is about 55ish in my 65 westy with the freeway flier) than 
when I drove 65-70.

&lt;&lt; Hello
 
 I want to mount an extern oil cooler, to get my oil temperature down, but I 
live in a place when it can get minus 10 degress celcius, so I also want to 
mount a thermostat to the oil cooler.
 It have been dicussed if it's safe to mount a thermostat (due to the 
circulation of oil). I mean that it is the save. As it is in a watercooled 
engine. Here the thermostat close the cooler for the water until it's hot 
enough, would'nt it be the same in a oil cooler or I'm I to far out ?
