Subject: Re: [VB] Weatherstrip replacement

&gt; appears to be the hardest is replacing the weatherstripping around the

&gt; getting the windwing glass out of the frame without damaging the frame?

Yes, first try carefully prying out of the front edge of the frame. If
it's in there real good, then spray Liquid wrench or WD-40 around the
frame to loosen up any rust and other crap that may be holding it in
there, then begin prying it out from the front edge. You will need to
spread the upper and lower ends of the frame slightly to help the glass
slide out, and pry from several points around the glass either
simultaneously or one at a time. Be very careful while doing all this, so
as not to break or scratch the wing window. Clean the whole affair up
immaculately when it's out. 

To install, either build the device shown in the Bentley manual, which
supports and pushs the glass back in, or get some gooey soapy water or
silicone spray-on lubricant all over the new rubber, or what I did, and I
don't know if they offer this service anymore, which is to call WW and ask
them if they will do it for you. They have (had in '95) the device which
reinserts the glass with the new rubber seal. 

&gt; I suppose I'll have to remove the old rivet holding the windwing in
&gt; place on top, and replace it somehow when I have replaced the rubber
&gt; around the glass of the windwing, and around the frame? 

Yup. Drill that sucker out. You can get replacement rivets of several
styles - there's the pop-rivet affair, and also the standard rivet, which
you can apply using some common sense, care and a large vise-grip with
some blocks of metal to properly shape the tail end of the rivet as you
form it by squeezing the whole affair. It's easier than it sounds.
