Hey Steven - I've been following your progress.  Glad to hear you took your
first run around the block in the splitty.  They are really awesome vehicle.
There is not one other vehicle on the market that is as much or as cool for
a daily driver as a splitty.  It garners tons of attention where ever you go
and even at shows, you are in the minority (unless you go to bus only
events).  Even if you don't enter a show, the parking lot presence does a
lot of good.  I'm looking so very forward to adding one more split to our
our little posse at the Omaha VW show in July.  Last year it was Terry Wolfe
and Rob Laffoon in their buses and this year, I'll have mine to add.  I
think Terry and I should park cargo door to cargo door and suspend a tarp
across the roof and make our own little pseudo campout.

Anyway, regarding the no windshields - safari's are _awesome_.  I
experienced my first ride in a double cab and my first ride with safaris in
Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz in KC the first of March.  Oh was it ever awesome.  I
stuck my head out of the windshield and looks straight down at the ground
going beneath us.  We had 5 or 5 hefty grown men in that Binz and with Dan's
1776 - wow!!!  Just an absolutely AWESOME cruise.  I really like safaris but
I'm either going to wait until I find a good used cheap set, or until Dan
makes some (if he decides to go that route), or I'm even thinking of making
my own set the way I want to.  I love the idea of off the shelf parts so if
that ever transpires, I'll let the list know about it.

I posted this message to the list because I thought a few more people would
enjoy reading it.

Later!
