&gt; He also had a side note that getting Avon tires
&gt; in the
&gt; US would be difficult.

That's an understatement.  I checked with their web page and their
dealer locater said that the nearest dealer to me was 50 miles away,
and I live next to LA!

I'm still looking for the holy grail of 185R14 all-season load range D
tires.  I saw the post about the Nokias, but those are about as easy to
find in sunny SoCal as Avons, and are too aggressive for my needs.
