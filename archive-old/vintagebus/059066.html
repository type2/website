Subject: '65 bus 6V to 12V wiper motor conversion

I set about re-greasing the wiper motor in the single cab today and after
cleaning the motor I noticed that the output gear bushings were wallered
out.  I dug through the stash and found another '65 wiper motor and set
about re-greasing it.  I finished up and reinstalled the motor in the bus
and it ran well and somewhat quieter too:)  Skip ahead to 10:00 PM and
boredom so I head out into the garage to fiddle with the old wiper motor and
see what could be done to convert it to 12 volts.  So I dig through the
stash some more and pull out a pile of wiper motors, find one from a '67
Beetle and take it apart.  First thing I do is compare the designs which are
close enough.  Next I compared the armatures and the '67 beetle one is ever
so slightly longer plus the field has one more plate than the '65.  I tried
the '67 armature in the '65 motor and it fit.  Replacing the brush plate I
noticed the tightness that was expected.  I test ran the motor and it didn't
want to turn which was also expected.  Next test was to swap the field,
armature and brush plate (sans one wire for speed 2) from the '67 motor to
the '65 motor.  Everything fit well and it ran fine on the test bench so
tomorrow I will swap these parts over to the motor that is in place and see
what happens.  Hopefully I will be voltage drop free tomorrow:)

Thomas
