Subject: [VB] spare tire in a NON-Walkthrough


S DAMN. With a 205/15/75 behind my seat not only does my the back of my seat
not go all they way back - but - when I lift the seat to access the tool
compartment - the seat bottom does not go up nearly as well as it did when I
had the old tire. This sucks.  The 205's got to be at least 2&quot; wider than
the old tire.

I feel for ya, got the same prob on my SC. Can't put my favorite tires in
the tire well behind the seat and they are too thick for the tire holder in
the treasure chest. I just throw it in the treasure chest and say the heck
with it!
