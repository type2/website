top of the window
&gt; frame.  When i pulled the rubber off, it cracked, and left the part in the
&gt; channel still in the channel.  Anyone who has replaced rubber on windows
&gt; hopefully knows what I am talking about.  How do I get the remaining strip
&gt; of rubber out of the channel in the window frame?  It looks like it should
&gt; just slide out, any tricks for &quot;convincing&quot; it to come out easy?


The channel is probably crimped at both ends to hold the  rubber in place.
Bend the crimps up to release them. You may also need something to lubricate
the rubber. Try soapy water or glycerin (available at the drug store)
