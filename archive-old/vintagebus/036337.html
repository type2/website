Recently I had to pull my engine out to get to the tranny and while looking in the bell housing I noticed the clips for the throwout bearing were broken.  I asked around and I was told that my clutch was adjusted too tight and that's what broke the clips. I don't understand how this could be the case and I remember following the proper pedal adjustment proceedure after I installed the motor with the new flywheel the last time.  Could there be another reason for this is happening?  Possibly the flywheel?
