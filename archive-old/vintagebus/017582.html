Subject: Sales Tax....I win!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone.  I called Izz's for the fourth time about
my being charged out of state sales tax.  Today I
talked to a girl there that explained that they &quot;just
got the whole sales tax thing figgured out&quot; and that
they could give me my money back now.  On the call
before that, they told me that they have shipped
several sets of windows to AZ and have allways charged
sales tax.  That got me to thinking... Izz's has been
in buisness for HOW MANY YEARS??  Talk about a scam! 
Who knows how many people have been overcharged by
$35+ dollars.  So if you have some of Izz's windows,
double check your recipt...  Thanks to all who wrote
back and reassured me of my gut feeling.
