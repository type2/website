Subject: Re: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

A castellated nut is required when there is a cotter pin hole.
I would not use a tie rod end that had none.
I personally am not so lucky as to afford one failure.
Vendor testamonials won't save you. Any warranty on those, Ronnie ?
( If not, your word is good as gold :)

&gt;   Gentley tap on the back side of the drag link end. This will set it in
the
&gt; hole allowing the nylock to tighten all the way. If you use castle nuts
you
&gt; will have to drill a hole for a cotter key, way more work then necessary.
&gt; All of my buses have ny-lock nuts on the tie rod ends and the drag link
and
&gt; have never had a failure.
