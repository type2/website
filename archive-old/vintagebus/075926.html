 So which if either sender is giving the correct data?
 
 Is the disparity between the two sender locations consistent with 
 others who have run dual senders? &gt;&gt;

To test your senders I'd put them in boiling water, which should be about 212F

I remeber that on th list a while ago it was said that senders at the sump do 
give lower readings than at the dipstick.
