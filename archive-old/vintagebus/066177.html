You can probably find that seal at your friendly local industrial supply 
house. Look for a place like Motion Industries or Applied in the yellow 
pages under bearings. You can also find them online if you don't have one 
locally.

&gt;Dear List:
&gt;
&gt;I need your help findingthe proper inner grease seals for the aftermarket 
&gt;front disc brake setup on my bus.  A year or so ago I purchased one of 
&gt;those German-made front disc brake conversion kits for a 1968 Bus front 
&gt;beam (which is attached to my 66 Samba).  I have recently had to do some 
&gt;work on this brake system which required me to remove the front inner 
&gt;grease seals in the rotors.  I beat up the seals pretty badly and need to 
&gt;replace them, but the stock grease seals for a '68 bus do not fit in these 
&gt;rotors.  The size of the grease seals in the disc brake kit were 45 x 62 x 
&gt;8A, which are smaller than the stock seals, which I believe are 50 x 64 x 
&gt;8.
&gt;
&gt;Can you please help me find the correct grease seals for this brake kit?
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;Richard Blake
