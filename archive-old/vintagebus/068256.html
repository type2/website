&gt;This may or may not be new information, but BP (British Petroleum) bought
&gt;out Castrol.  I know in the past many people had concerns about Castrol
&gt;because they were a branded middle man and actually did not produce any
&gt;oil products.

Hrm?  Sounds like something a salesman for another brand of oil would say.
:)  I only found one reference to this, in 1996, in the archives.

&gt;It was news to me and I just wanted to pass it on.

http://www.bpamoco_dot_com/centres/press/p_r_detail.asp?id=677 says that BP
Amoco made the Castrol takeover offer on 14 March 2000 and completed it
on 7 July 2000, so anything on the Castrol site probably reflects the new
situation of BP Amoco ownership.

http://www_dot_castrol_dot_com/castrol/life_sourcing.html (caution: excessive Flash)
does say that &quot;Castrol does not participate in digging for crude oil, or
setting up oil rigs.  We specialise in the development, refinement and
blending of the lubricant from the raw products.&quot;

http://www_dot_castrol_dot_com/castrol/life_blending.html says &quot;Castrol blends
lubricants in a number of locations around the world.  Among the largest
plants are those at Sydney, Australia, Antwerp in Belgium, Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil, Hamburg in Germany, Stanlow in the UK and Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
in the USA.&quot;

Castrol has been selling differently-refined dead dinosaur juice as
&quot;synthetic&quot;.  Mobil sued them for truth in advertising and lost.  Some
people don't care for Castrol for this reason.  This has come up on the
VB/T2 lists a few times.

There is a rec.autos.tech thread about it here:
http://groups.google_dot_com/groups?rnum=41&amp;seekm=3A64DDEA.EA3C0061%40bellsouth_dot_net#link41
which seems to imply that Castrol was a reseller, at least before the BP
Amoco purchase.  Another article (from 1997) is from someone who claimed
to work for Castrol and said they don't own refineries but do have their
own R&amp;D/QA for their products:
http://groups.google_dot_com/groups?selm=tom-2009971656550001%40tommy.tezcat_dot_com&amp;output=gplain
Try &quot;castrol refinery&quot; on Google Groups for hundreds of other posts.

To round up the other popular entries in this FART, Consumer Reports
magazine did an oil comparo in NYC taxis (Generic Motors V6s, I think)
a couple of years back and basically said &quot;buy whatever name brand oil
is on sale&quot;.  Yes, these tests were run in late-model water-cooled V6s
with full-flow oil filtration and may not directly apply to our 1930s
air-cooled boxer-4s with no oil filters whatsoever.  VW made specific
recommendations in the Bentleys, but they were dealing with the oil
technology of 30+ years ago (for Splitties.)  Berg claims that synthetic
oil increases head temps and reduces oil temps.  Small aircraft use
air-cooled boxer-4s and some of them use synthetic (but see
http://www.swaviator_dot_com/html/issueja02/Hangar7802.html - among other
things, aviation oils are non-detergent. (!))

Disclaimer: I run Castrol GTX straight 30 weight in my Bus, along with
a semi-sekrit additive blend (cockatoo poop, among other things).  And
like the High Performance chapter in later editions of the Idiot manual
says, &quot;Asking people what kind of oil they use is like asking what beer
they drink.&quot;

If anyone has anything to add, please speak up quick.  The &quot;what tires
should I use&quot; thread is scheduled next.  :)
