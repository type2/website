&gt;An experienced and reliable local tire outlet claims that at least half the

What I hate is when an alignment shop (really a tire store or car dealer
who also does alignments) finishes working on my car, charges me $50-$60,
and the car still pulls strongly to one side (the very reason I took it
in). When I complain, I get the same old be &quot;the car is aligned perfectly,
so it must be a radial tire pull&quot;. Then they suggest swapping the front
tires side to side. I'm tired of hearing this BS cop-out excuse for not
figuring out the real reason for the pull. I don't want to swap my tires
from side to side, and then wait for them to separate. Aligning to spec
doesn't work for every car. Cars can be bent slightly, suspension bushings
can be worn unevenly, etc. It may be necessary to figure out what's really
going on with the suspension/frame/body relationship to figure out how to
modify the alignment settings to compensate and make the car track
straight. These guys don't want to bother with that process, it might take
brainpower or extra effort. Oh, no, not that.

I'm just sick and tired of these guys using 'radial tire pull' as an excuse
to take my money, while giving me zero satisfaction.

Hi, Kabayo,

You should make sure that the camber is correct. Not caster, as this is
unadjustable and involves the geometery which makes the steering wheel return
to straight ahead (mainly accomplished by the tilting of the &quot;hinge&quot; of the
wheel (kingpin) backwards a few degrres from vertical). The camber, also
responsible for getting the wheels to return to &quot;straight ahead&quot;, is the
tilting of the wheels themselves inward or outward from vertical. This is
adjustable and is accomplished with shims on the link pins. If, for example,
the right wheel is properly adjusted, and the left one is, say, leaning inward
too much, the bus will pull to the left. If the left wheel is leaning outward
too much, the bus will pull to the right.

Please eliminate the obvious stuff like dragging brakes, incorrect toe-in, and
different tire types and brands/inflation pressures. Also, try to find out if
the bus has been in a collision. If it has, it could be &quot;crabbing&quot; down the
road ever so slightly, in which case the front end &quot;thinks&quot; the bus should be
going &quot;this way&quot; but the bus is instead wanting to go &quot;that way instead&quot;. Of
course, this can be properly corrected in a &quot;frame&quot; shop, or can be corrected
at home diddling with the link pin shims. An alignment shop can't do the
latter for you effectively as their machinery always assumes that the bus is
square and within specs. You have to do the shim diddling and then just ask
them to do the toe-in only (or you could actually do the toe-in yourself -
idiot book).

Hope this helps!
