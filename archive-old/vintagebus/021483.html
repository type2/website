Subject: Re:  Binding Door Hinge
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

In the process of stripping my bus in preparation of painting, I 
noticed that the driver's side door hinges were loose.  After 
tightening, the door begins to bind about 4 inches from total 
closure.  The remaining 4 inches is putting stress on the top hinge. 
I am now thinking that the PO kept the hinge loose to avoid 
damage.  Should I live with this or correct it?  How do I correct?  
Take the door off and bend the hinge?  I am afraid that would cause 
more problems.  
- - -  --
well, is this the original door?    Has the area been hit?   Where is it
binding?   My fix would probably be o trya and adjust it as best I could,
figure out where exactly it needed to be, and &quot;adjust &quot; the hinges by pulling
down on the door or by jacking up the door (using a lonish 2 x 4 on the bottom
of the door.    But figure out exactly where things need to go before bending
stuff.   
........
Also, speaking of hinges....my engine hatch hinges appear to worn 
significantly.  What wears out? the pin or the actual hinge?  Is 
there a good source for new ones?   Another problem I have back 
there is the hinge has pulled from the sheet metal of the engine lid. 
 Any fixes for that or do I replace the rear hatch completely?
- - - -  -
I'd try to find better ones- they are even used on some years of bay window
buses(through 74?)  Or you can drill them out and fit new pins.   You would
have to weld the engine lid if the place the hinge bolts to is breaking loose,
or replace it, but it is probably harder to find a nice replacement engine
lid.
