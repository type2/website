Subject: Wrong Muffler?

So I bought a &quot;new but dinged up&quot; bus muffler from a VW shop about a year 
ago for the 1600SP I'm rebuilding.  In attempting to fit the muffler to 
the heads, it seems about an inch or two too narrow (i.e. with one flange 
on one head, the other muffler flange would need to stretch an additional 
1-2&quot; to fit on the other head).

The muffler is a stock muffler - or at least an Ernst or whatever.

I know that these mufflers sometimes need a little cajoling and prying to 
fit properly, but it seems like just a bit too far to be &quot;right&quot;.  Is it 
possible that I have an older style muffler - like a 36 or 40 HP muffler?  
Would a 36/40 HP muffler look different than a 1600SP muffler (i.e. 
more of a round shape, or something) or would it be different at all?

Any suggestions welcome: I can attempt at prying it, but thought I'd query 
first.

Cheers,
