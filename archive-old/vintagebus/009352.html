I actually own the $80 pressurized sand blaster from Harbor Freight.  I love
it. The only thing that I would recommend is that you buy some extra valves
for the end. Because if you accidentally don't open the end valve all the
way, it will cut through it in a matter of minutes.  This thing blasts
great, and it's completely adjustable.  I blasted thin metal on my swamp
cooler (and much more), and never cut any holes through it. Oh, and you
really need to get a sand strainer (to get any big pieces out), or you will
fight with clogged nozzles.

&gt; Guess I should clarify, they do sell quite a bit of sand blasting
equipment.
&gt;      I think it would be considered a pot type blaster, not the syphon
feed
&gt; type, and not a cabinet. the kit consist of a red metal tank with two
wheels
&gt; to move it around, a hose, and a nozel. normally sells for about $129 on
sale
&gt; for around $89. I would be interested to here from those who have used
both
&gt; the pot type and the syphon feed type and how they compare. I realy need
to
&gt; clean the underside of the 59 up and get the suspension back in.
&gt; thanks

&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; Is that the table top one? if so thats a joke. No hookup to vaccuum out
the
&gt;  dust, Sand blows out of the top likes its not even attached, sand blows
out
&gt;  of all the seams, air attachment leaked as well. 2 tubes of silicant
sealer
&gt;  later, still leaks sand out of the seams..have to use it ouside with a
&gt;  respirator and its still unbearable and messy..may as well have bought
just
&gt;  a pickup-line and a bag of sand.
