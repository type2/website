Subject: looking for Richard Palmer

Hello Folks,

I was wondering if anyone has heard from Richard
Palmer lately? I am not asking for any urgent matter,
I would just like to buy acouple of his great bus
T-shirts that he designs. I haven't seen him post on
the list lately and didn't know if anything was wrong
or if he has just been up to other things. I was just
concerned. Thank you and good luck with your beautiful
splitwindow busses!!!

David Kelly
From Wilmington, North Carolina
