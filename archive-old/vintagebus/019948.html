  Wash the part thoroughly so you don't get any grit in 
there when buffing. If there are light scratches, use a 
soft cloth and acrylic specific polish and gently buff 
by hand. 
  If they are still there after that, you can step it up 
to a buffing wheel and worst case use jeweler's rouge 
(this will introduce distortion though). Then go back 
over it with the acrylic polish to take out the 
scratches from the rouge.
  Most acrylics have a UV inhibitor, but if they are 
yellowed, you cannot remove that.
  Polycarbonates such as GE's Lexan are VERY soft and 
susceptible to scratching. If it has a &quot;marguard&quot; type 
coating that helps prevent scratches. However, any 
serious polishing you do to polycarbonate will just 
introduce more scratches. 
  I'm on digest, so if you have any questions when 
trying this, it is best to reach me at:

  Hope this helps, good luck.

&gt; I have a set of OG Plexiglas BD corner windows, how 
should I polish them?
&gt; I use a product called PLEXIS, this helped clear them 
up and make shine but
&gt; still have some scratchs. Plexis is a product used by 
marine and aircraft
&gt; industry for eisenglass and lexan windows, it really 
works!
