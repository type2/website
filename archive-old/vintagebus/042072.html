Of course, since this was made public, we were PERFECTLY happy with a
replacment digital copy of all of the messages..indeed, this is exactly
what was initially requested.

They are not, and were not intended, to be given to any one person. Only
back to the list server. Period.



&gt; copies of them in bulk (CD-ROM or ZIP file for download) to whomever asks?


This was not a request by whomever asks. Instead it was a request by the
administration team that has made this possibile for so many years.
