Subject: Installing 40hp Muffler and Heater Boxes

Hey all,

I did a search through the archives but I was unable to find an answer
to my question so I am hoping that someone will be able to get me an
answer quick.

I am installing a stock 40hp muffler in a bus that I am desperately
trying to get on the road. The engine is in and the heater boxes are
bolted on. When I go to put the muffler on, it doesn't line up. Do I
need to fit it all together without tightening anything first?

When I put the muffler on the head bolts, the heater boxes are 1/8-1/4
off. Though I forget if they slightly above or below the hole. I am
curious if there is a &quot;proper&quot; install sequence to get it all in.

Thanks,

Matthew
(BTW I have been an off and on again lurker, mostly because I have
never had a daily driver splittie, though that day is approaching.)
