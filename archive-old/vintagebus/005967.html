Subject: Bugpack linkage

I got my Kadrons used and the little springsteel clips in the linkage were
missing and the whole setup looked weak to me. I E-mailed Bergman about
their's and I was told they were $122. They must be VERY good, but I didn't
want to pay it. In my search for clips, I was at my friendly neighboborhood
VW parts dealer, and he comes out with a BUGPACK linkage for $26. Although I
have not run the Kadrons much yet, the linkage looks very strong, very
adlustable. They use rubber at the ends instead of clips, and that may wear
out quickly, but otherwise I think it's a good setup.
