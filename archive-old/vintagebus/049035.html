&gt;&gt;The &quot;color code&quot; on your mtag is the internal code VW used to
&gt;&gt;represent that color.  You can't waltz into a paint store
&gt;&gt;and say &quot;Hey Joe, mix me up a gallon of L31, would ya?&quot; 

I see that Clara did it.  I, too, was able to ask for a match to L512
Velvet Green
and L87 Pearl White.  The DuPont book had a page with VW numbers on it.
 
Actually, I picked up a color chip page in a &quot;paper&quot; vendor booth at a
car show
with some of the codes on it.
