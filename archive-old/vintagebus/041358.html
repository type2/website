Hey Now!

Forget spiders 'cause everyone's got those.  I'll crawl under the bus to
fill up the tranny and sure enough there will be some webs hanging around.
They seem to like to setup camp for the busses under resto.  My driver on
the other hand has a huge problem with Yellow Jackets! For months on end I
couldn't tell where the hell these things were comin' from.  I'd take the
bus out for a spin and as soon as I got goin' down the road a coupla of
them would pop up and fly over my head.  Tryin' to get them out of the
slider was a joke.  Opening the door wasn't gonna happen(two hands on the
wheel at ALL times). I just had to dodge them as best I could until they
didn't want to be near me anymore.  This happened most every time I took
it out.  Finally I stripped the bus(not for this reason but lets just say
why not) and found that they had made a nice nest behind the front kick
panel.  I'd had my fun with them so I had my friend come into the shop. He
brought along his vacum cleaner and sucked them out of the front while
thye were sleeping.  Now she's a runnin' bellisemo.
