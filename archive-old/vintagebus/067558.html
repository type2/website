Subject: Starting question

Latley my bus has been hard starting.  The timing, points, coil, condenser
are good.  New plugs, good fuel pump.  The carb is about a year old right
now.  The compression is 110 on #1 and 120 on the rest.  Once it gets going
it runs great, it just doesn't want to start up right away like it used to.
Any suggestions would be great.  I wonder if my carb needs adjustment.
