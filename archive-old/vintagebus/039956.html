Astrogeek question: New or used harness?

My personal choice would be the new harness from Wiring Works.  When I 
checked with them directly last summer they quoted around $200 for a 63 
deluxe harness... course that was before I had decoded the m-codes and found 
it was really a '62, sigh.  Don't know what the price is now or how much for 
yours... things change.
