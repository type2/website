Subject: Closing in, 400 hrs bodywork, vintage nazi?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

As far as I''ve seen, most of the true vintage followers are usually too busy 
looking for the correct parts to finish their current project or in the shop 
working on it! There are too many Charlie Hamill wannabes in this hobby today 
that have never seen an original bus let alone try to perfectly restore one. 
You all know the type. Just ask them to see their private collection of 
perfect buses or portfolio of restoration work, they are usually hard pressed 
to come up with a photo.
Kyle said it the best, we are just the current owners, caretakers of these 
vehicles, we should do our best to preserve it for the next lucky owner.
As for the 400 hours of body work on the current project, does that make me a 
vintage nazi? No, I am just trying to preserve this 57 23 window for the next 
owner.
As for dumping thousands of dollars of my own money into reproducing door 
panel material and seat material for 55-64 buses, does that make me a vintage 
nazi? Maybe. Yet again, all I am trying to do is recreate the allusion of the 
perfect bus that so many PO's and current owners try so hard to destroy.
By the way, there should be more hobby gone mad people like Hamill, that can 
truly walk the walk. I do not know about the rest of you but I am tried of 
hearing talk, I personally can't wait for the day when buses are judged like 
the early Porsche or Duesenbergs. How many of these cars have you seen 
unrestored, with faded paint, lowered and the wrong engine? If you want to 
see the value of buses continue to rise than full total restorations are the 
only way to go.
