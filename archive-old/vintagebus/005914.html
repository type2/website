Hey list, An old VW mechanic down the street from me built one out of an old
trailer axle and one piece of angle iron. It works pretty slick to load a
bus on a trailer, but I don't know how it would tow. The angle iron sits
flat on the axle on one side, and the other side points upward. He blew two
holes in the angle iron that match up with the frame horns. You just run a
couple of bolts through the angle into the frame horns and you are ready to
go! Looks way cool too since the axle is so much wider than the bus!
  Josh and I bought a SC at an auction once that had gear reduction boxes
and axle tubes bolted to the spring plates, but with no tranny in the
center! It rolled forward pretty good; but when you tried to roll backwards
the spring plates just spread apart!

&gt; Anyone  figure out a  neat way to tow a bus without a tranny ?
&gt;
&gt; something that bolts to the spring plates and the stock cradle mounts....
&gt;
&gt; need to move a bus with no tranny to the paint shop and keep it mobile so
&gt; they can move it around.......
&gt; the  back needs to have 2 wheels so it can be pulled  up on a car trailer
if
&gt; needed........
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas.......thanks
&gt;
