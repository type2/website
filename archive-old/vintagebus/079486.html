Subject: Re: [VB] Flywheel seal leak?

Hi Phil,
Definitely use only the red FW seals.  They are made of silicon and do not 
harden up like the black or blue FW seals.  You might try Ronnie for them.  
  Make sure to check that your oil pressure relief valve/s are stock!  We had 
an engine rebuilt and could not get it below 60 PSI for that reason when 
warmed up in 70 F outside temps.  80+ PSI and you distort the oil cooler and blow 
FW seals.
