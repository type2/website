Hi Lars,
Shhh, let us not wake it up! ;-)
 
&lt;&lt; I'm considering to change my rear &amp; front axle on my 64 splitbus out with 
69 baywindow axles. But i'm confused regarding the gearbox on the 69 
(Baywindow).
 Should I used the baywindow gearbox with my 1900 engine or should I buy a 
bug 67 (1500) gearbox ?  &gt;&gt;

If you are going to carry or tow/carry anything of wieght you will want a 
stonger tranny which the bug due to it's axles is not.  The 69 bus tranny 
would be stong enough, but we do not know that you could transplant it 
without major bus suspension/body surgery in the reaqr torsion area.  
 
&lt;&lt; I would like to get a continuing speed at approx 75-80 miles (120-128 
kmph) ? And what would it be if I also would like to could pull caravan ? &gt;&gt;

The problem is at what engine RPM at 75-80 MPH in fourth.  3,000 RPM seems to 
be the bus best RPM for best engine longevity and MPG (LPH).  Which both of 
these factors will save you alot of $$$ if you can make the engine last long 
and not suck fuel like crazy especially since you are in Europe.  Sounds like 
using a 1960-67 bus tranny with RGBs, 3.44 R&amp;P, .82 fourth, freeway flier 
tranny and either a 1776 type1/2 engine or a 1800 4 engine.  Even with this 
you are most likely going to be more likely a less than 70MPH bus.  While 
trailering we would never push it over 60 MPH.  Anyhow going much faster than 
70 MPH will result in dangerous handling due to areodynamics, most likely 
resulting in a big accident.      Eric&amp;Barb
