Hi Andre, I have those same windows on my EZ Camper (close cousin of the
Sundial). That's the style window they generally used on Panel conversions.
Although, the windows on your cargo doors are regular windows! Maybe
someone put those doors on separately? Anyway, although the bus was shipped
over as a panel, it was probably never sold that way. Dealers couldn't keep
up with the demand for Westy's here, so they sent out Panels and Standards
to companies like Sundial and EZ to be converted and sold as campers. True,
it might be a little more work to bring it back as it's true camper self,
but it'd be worth it!

Have fun!
