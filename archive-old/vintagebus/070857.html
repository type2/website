Subject: Re: [VB] My current project

Interesting thread... I like the lift, but share concerns about safety as
with any lift or jack. Also, it seems the ceiling and trusses would have to
be quite high.  I have always envisioned a sort of narrow stairwell/trench
or 'cellar' in my garage floor like some of the oil-change shops use. All
poured concrete and the bus stays at floor level but you walk underneath it.
It'd need a heavy steel cover so the floor would all be flush when you are
not under the bus. This way, no falling busses and no need for an
excessively high ceiling. I'll still take the lift though for brake/wheel
work!

&gt; Is it safe to be under the vehicle like that? It looks like you push over
&gt; the bus real easy...so, how much and where can I get one of these?
