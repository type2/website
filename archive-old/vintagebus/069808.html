Subject: RE: [VB] side scoops any opinions

The problem with putting your hot oil in front of the cooling air for the rest
of the engine is that it raises the overall temp of the engine. The vents are
for cool air to be drawn into the fan shroud and circulated around the engine.
If you pre-heat the air you defeated the purpose.

I put a pair of 3 pass coolers forward of the flywheel underneath my 71 westy
when I had one, and it worked well on long trips. I use a similar method for
my trike, although cooling isn't as much of an issue on it.

If your bus had needed them VW would have put them there. That said, I
thinknthey are ugly, unless of course they are made out of cooking pans
in a Martha Stewart-like style!

I've got a big 10&quot; x10&quot; x 2&quot; oil cooler in there and the scoop helps to
force air through the cooler.
It has some utility if you need them.
