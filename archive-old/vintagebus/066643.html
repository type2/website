Subject: 50MPH Whine--??

I have a 1967 Big Nut tranny bus--running a Very recent tranny overhaul and
reduction boxes--less then 7000 miles ago--
One friend did the tranny - 3.88 and changing of 3rd and 4th gear -- Another
friend did the reduction boxes with new bearings--

Starting at 45MPH, I get a whine out of the back of Bessie-- loudest at 50
MPH  NO WHINE Under 45 MPH and No Whine above 60MPH--

When I have it at 50MPH with the whine and take my foot OFF the gas -- No
Whine  &quot;IT&quot; only makes noise Under Power at 45 MPH to 60MPH under load--
Going into Neutral--No Whine--

So the guy that rebuilt the tranny says all is well in the tranny --It is
the Gears in the Reduction boxes that are wore  --The guy who built rebuilt
the reduction gears says it is the Ring and Pinion ??

I took Bessie to one of the best tranny rebuilders in Phoenix--Tom
says--Could be the gears in the reduction boxes?--or ring and pinion?--or
main shaft?.

As of now I am waiting for a set of gears to try in the reduction boxes and
go from there--Any thoughts ? TWWM, uj

PS: Please do not tell me  &quot;Just Don't drive between 45 and 60 MPH !!
