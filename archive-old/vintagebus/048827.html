Subject: '59 Kombi resto....first drive

Took the '59 Kombi for it's first drive after the engine overhaul. 
I'm still amazed how easy the engine starts up and how smooth it 
runs. I live on a very rural dead -end road that is about 1/2 mile 
long. So rather than getting out of walking range, I just went back 
and forth up and down the road about 5 or 6 times.

Now for the lesson I learned. Everything I've read in books, seen 
posted on the list, or have been told, is to go ahead and change out 
the clutch disc when the engine is out. Of course i didn't. So now it 
seems like my clutch is slipping. I may try to adjust the cable and 
see if that helps some. Otherwise I'll have to pull the engine and 
fix it. I believe the tranny is fine. It seems to shift fine and all. 
It's not slipping terribly bad. I was able to get up to 40-45 mph. 
But something definatly wasn't right. Engine ran great though. So 
that's all good.

So it was still a blast and I'm pretty darn happy. I've got something 
going on with my brakes as well. Have to pump 'em. I'll try bleeding 
them again.

Fun fun fun in the bus! Getting closer!
