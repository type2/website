&gt; :(  So does anyone know tha approximate chassis # which this change occured?
&gt; Just trying to get the bus back the way it should be

My '57 SC was manufactured after the change having the chrome screw in ring
and no lamp on the lid.  Next time I'm at the shop I'll get the number but I
think the change came after 320 000.

'57 Single Cab (Louise - Getting a NEW Bed)
'93 MR2 Turbo (freeway flyer)

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
