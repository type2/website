don't lower your bus if you dont want to do any permanent mods!or
just lower in moderation.to completelly slam you bus
you need to get rid of the stock steering box,narrow the beam,and
raise the front floors..if not than your not serious!leave it
stock!if you do,do all this then you bus will still ride sweet!I
think my bus rides better than stock,more cadillacy!!!-cameron

 ------------------ 
from my experience with lowered buses (not that I have owned
one, just from 
being a passenger and observations) it does not seem to make
sense to lower a 
bus if you do plan on hauling loads with it, unless you dont
mind the 
scraping.   The scraping can be the bottom of the steering gear
box and the 
lower part of the muffler.   this can happen on going into/out
of driveways 
with an unladen (1 person inside, no extra gear) lowered bus
(with the 
wolfgang lowered spindles/straight axle rear end).   Also, if
you load it, 
the tires can scrape in the wheel wells, eating up the tires.
  If this seems 
okay to you, and you dont mind the scraping  (wear on tires,
more frequent 
muffler replacement), carry on.  If your tow set up is one that
does not hang 
weight on the rear of the bus, that really should not make a
huge difference, 
and may be the best way to go for hauling if your bus is lowered
(small 
trailer).

&lt;&lt; I plan on lowering my bus that I have. I know of the lowering
kit that is 
on
 the market that does away with the reduction boxes, but can
you lower it
 just like a bug by turning the splines, and leave the reduction
boxes? And
 if so, how much can you lower it before the camber gets too
ridiculous? I
 still plan on hauling stuff in my bus, maybe even towing my
oval, and I
 don't plan on going on too many long road trips (just the occasional
show).
 So I thought it would be better to keep the reduction boxes.
 Also I have heard rumor (don't know of anyone that's actually
done it), that
 you can swap the spindles in the front from the left side to
the right, and
 vica/versa to get 4-5&quot; of drop without affecting the camber,
or bumpsteer.
 Has anyone done this themselves? I know many of you don't agree
with
 lowering a bus, but I think the lowered buses that I've been
seeing in
 HotVW's look really good.
 
 Any technical help would be greatly appreciated.
