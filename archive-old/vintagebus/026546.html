&gt; An even easier way to adjust valves:
&gt; Turn engine in direction of rotation. When exhaust valve JUST starts to
&gt; open, adjust intake. Rotate engine, watch exhaust open then close, watch
&gt; intake open then close. JUST as the intake closes, adjust the exhaust.
&gt; Go to next cylinder. Same procedure. Takes longer to R + R valve covers than
&gt; to adjust. Don't need to watch dist. rotor or timing mark.

Again, this method is perfectly acceptable IF and ONLY IF you are using
a stock camshaft. ANY of the hot- medium- or mild- grind cams with a
non-stock ramp to the lobes may very well be far from the lowest point
on the lobe ( which is where you want the valve play set from) if you
use this method, and you will end up with loose valves a clattering.
Loose valves not only cut down power, but as Stephen pointed out
earlier, a loose valve will not cool as well, because heat dissipation
onto the seat surface of the head will be lessened. 
If you are going to try one of these methods on an angine you yourself
did not assemble, I would check all valve clearances the old-fashioned
one cyclinder-at-a-time method after you do it, the very first time. If
all is well, you most likely have a stock or close enough to stock cam
that you can go with this method.
