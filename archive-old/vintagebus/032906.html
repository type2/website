&gt;  I managed to score a 50k mile 67 trans, tunring freely, not H20 in it, and
&gt;  decent looking oil. Surface rust is on tubes and rgbs. 46s are tight, and
&gt;  someone butchered a backingplate, so disassembly without a bus weight might
&gt;  be fun. No leaks visible.
&gt;   Many have told me to slap this thing in and go, but I was hoping to get it
&gt;  freshend without the horror stories I hear about whinny trans, and that I
&gt;  should stick with the virign build, etc. Also I am east coast, and since
&gt;  this thing is heavy, I'd like to know if anyone recommends any one  on east
&gt;  coast for stock type II rebuilds and rgbs. I really want the exterior 
redone
&gt;  also, so if I do the boxes my self and take a chance on the trans, what can
&gt;  I use for finish without meessing up the guts? Is a nasty input shaft a big
&gt;  problem, even if splines are good?
&gt;   At this point, it looks like Rancho is going to get it, but they are so
&gt;  busy I will be out of business for a month or more. Is there any real way 
to
&gt;  diagnose much on a trnas that is just lying there? I was thinking a drill
&gt;  and rubber hose to turn the trans at some rpms to listen for noise...
&gt;  Decision time....
&gt;  AL

you can use the hockey stick to shift it into gears.  remember that it is 
mirror image upside down from where the stick shift takes the gears,   and 
you can turn the spline to turn the axles.  doubt you could turn it faster 
witha drill, but if you have a spare motor out of a bus you could ground 
start it, use the clutch and shift through the gears.

myself,  if I knew it was 50K on a rebuild, I would probably slap it in and 
giv eit a go in the bus.  I might be tempted to remove the axles and inspect 
the RGBoxes, but with the 46s tight that is hard to undo outside of a bus 
unless you have acess to air impacts.

have fun
