Subject: ENGINE NUMBERS

Hi Folks,
Got a question, hoping someone can help me. I have an opportunity to get a
spare engine
for my bus. The current owner says it's a 1500. While checking it over I
noticed on the fan housing theres
a metal Volkswagen factory tag showing a letter H and then a six digit serial
number. Thats correct for about a 1964 or
1965 model 1500  (I think)   But, on the engines generator pedestal, the
serial number given is different.  There's
the letters,   &quot;A  S&quot;    then the six digit number. I'm confused by these two
sets of numbers. Is this indeed a 1500
and what set of numbers should I go with? I'm leaning toward the ones on the
pedestal. However, whats up with the  &quot;A S&quot;
letters in the serial number?  I don't have a listing for that.  Can someone
set me straight?
regards,
Mike Turner
