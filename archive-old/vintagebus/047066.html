You don't want to breath too much of the fumes, it will make you loose your

Hi Rick,
We talked to our local welding supply shop about this.  Turns out the 
vaporized zinc will attack you liver pretty quick if you do that much.  If 
you have to do that kind of work with no protective breathing system you 
should drink at least a quart of milk before.  Otherwise you can make a 
breathing system out of an old vaccume cleaner and tubing to pump fresh air 
to you or buy the $1,500.00 pro system that does the same thing.    Eric&amp;Barb
