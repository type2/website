Hey, I have a Friday question:

Who are we saving the bandwidth for, and where do we deposit it for safe
keeping?  How long will we save it for?


1959 Bus rexcue tomorrow, standard, complete, driven and parked in 1975,
resting in peace, until Saturday.

Cost:
I had to supply a similar storage shed for the guy, gave him an '81 rolling
shell, nice side door that slides I told him, better than those two that
open outward.
