i don't think that they did start production that
early. the earliest that i thought they did was '62.
did you check the vin #, or just go by what the owner
said? is it for sale? does it have a westfalia-type
setup, or does it have a campbox like mine
(http://www.limekey_dot_net/dormobile). i am very
interested by this message.

66 dormobile.

&gt; Does anyone have any info on the early dormobiles? 
&gt; say...pre-64?  I
&gt; found a 59 Dormobile in town here that is pretty
&gt; nice...and its
&gt; COMPLETE!  I couldn't believe it.  All the seats are
&gt; there...the water
&gt; pump, closets, stove, etc...  and its a 59! It also
&gt; had the green/white
&gt; canvas.
&gt; I'll have pictures up sooner or later of it...
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't think dormobile started their production
&gt; this early??
