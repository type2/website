 I guess this is the season for hot running motors.
 
 My story.   300 miles on a top end(new p&amp;c's &amp; heads) rebuild on a '71 AE 
case
 1600 DP, all new heads, dog house, all tin (with lower cool tin) in place, 
all
 seals in place, no external cooler or full flow, timing (vacuum &amp; points) and
 valves dead on, C/R is stock for this 1600, 34 pict carb.  This motor is 
pushing
 a '62 double cab with a big nut tranny with 205 75 15's.
 
 The problem is hot running (berg dip stick gauge) with just 30 min at speed
 (60-65) on a 85 degree day.  I'm guessing this is at least 235 since this is
 what the gauge says it actuates at.  I also have a CHT gauge (had it laying
 around so decided to use it) on #3 and it stays right around 300-350 on the
 freeway no mater what speed I drive.  With the dip stick back in it is a bit 
too
 warm to hold on to for any length after driving, and the oil light flickers
 after a freeway run.
-----------
I know this is really hard, but try slowing down a bit.  see how that affects 
your temps. remeber that discussion re how the drag goes up cubed with speed 
and the cooling only directly?   Any idea on what rpms 60-65 is?  i mean can 
you borrow a tach to check?
 ............
 The only thing I can think of is a clogged oil cooler.  I cleaned and reused 
it
 and then later read the Hoover comments on such action...dooh!   Any 
thoughts on
 what might be my problem?  
-----------
that sounds kind of unlikely.    But taking it and run it through solvent for 
a week wont hurt.
Do you have all the tin there and gap free?  No circle spaces?  foam around 
the cooler inside the fan shroud so that the air blows through the cooler and 
not around?  the little vanes in the cooler not bent (use little screwdriver 
to open any mushed ones) foam/seals around the doghouse venting?   Fresh air 
tubes good and connected?  and connected well to the heater boxes underneath? 
  Good engine compartment seal  etc?  just double check.   

The bottom lines may be that after a certain point things run hotter, 

...................
 I'm planning on adding a pressure and oil temp
 gauges.  Where do people install the senders?  I've read all the Hoover 
stuff on
 that, but I'm not going to split the case just to install senders.  This case
 has a plug just up and to the right of the oil pump.  I think it has a place 
for
 a hex wrench.  Is this thing the threaded plug the sermons talks about??
------------------
I use a dual sender screwed into the oil pressure switch spot, VDO sender 
cost ~$30, but works good, some people prefer a T and using two senders, one 
for pressure and one for idiot light

My oil temp sender is the oil pressure relief plug kind on the 65 and the 
dipstick kind on the 53.   I think I like the first kind better.
 ..................
 One more thing...are there dog house flaps and non dog house flaps?  I have a
 set and they don't seem to fit my dog house fan shroud...the linkage seems 
like
 it has to have a wider step to clear the dog house.
 ---------------
the flaps them selves are the same, the horzontal linkage is different,   The 
dog house has a little two to one linkage on each side, then a specialy 
shaped bar from side to side, while the non dog has a linkage bar with four 
holes for all the flaps that, as you find, does not fit with the doghouse 
stuff.

According to Berg, this does send the air better for cooling.
