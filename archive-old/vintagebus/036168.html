&lt;&lt; Need the clips to attach the brake cables to the shoes for my e brake, and
 for the life of me, can't find them, does any one know the correct part name
 or number? &gt;&gt;

Hi Al
Do you mean the clips that attach the brake lever arms to the shoes?  Then 
the cables hook over the hooked ends of the arms.  If you are missing these 
arms you need.
1.  113 609 613 A and 614 A  left and right brake levers (one each side.).
2.  211 609 601 B Anchor pin (One per each side.).
3.  N 12 228 2  Spring washer B 8 (One per each side.).
4.  211 609 619  C-washer  - Brake lever anchor pin (One per each side.).
   You also need to figure out which year rear end you have so you can 
replace the brack shoes properly.   Eric&amp;Barb
