&gt;  NQ also needs to know what fan belt to use, it is smaller in
&gt;circumference.  Someone recently posted that they are using the
&gt;smaller Porsche pulley, what brand and part number fan/generator
&gt;belt are you using?  I'm sure there are alot of us who are interested
&gt;also.


I can figure out what size belt I need but if anyone is running this setup,
I'd be glad to hear the info.  I've always just used a piece of rubber
tubing and run it through the pulley and mark it off so that when I go to
the FLAPS I can match to the closest size.  I still don't know what the
pulley comes off of - Porsche 356, 911, 914?  I'm in the dark here...
