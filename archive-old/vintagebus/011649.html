Monday...yeh?

        Anyway, this buddy of mine was talking about a secret in building
V-dub engines that he heard about in Denver, CO a couple weeks ago.  He was
talking with this guy that was getting 300+ horsepower out of our dear
V-dub hearts.  Anyway, this guy asked if he had ever noticed the dings in
four opposing edges on a piston during rebuild.  My guru, an experienced
rebuilder since the late '60's, had noticed it, but never knew what caused
it.  The guy he met went on to explain that it is caused during assembly
while torquing down the heads.  He decided to put together a rig that
allowed him to torque the cylinders to spec, then lightly hone the
cylinders.  This would allow the cylinders to properly &quot;round&quot; while under
torque of the heads.

        This is probably old news on the West Coast....but I thought maybe
the rest of us still living in the past  would find the concept
interesting.
