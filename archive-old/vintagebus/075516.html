&gt;If your state requires liability coverage then get the absolute
&gt;cheapest you can find.

When Missouri made insurance mandatory in the early 90s, you could either
show them the proof-of-insurance card from your agent, OR you could post
a bond ($10,000, secured, I think) with the state.  This might be another
option.

&gt;What we are all going to see soon is a complete examination of our
&gt;personal and public lives before we can purchase any kind of insurance.
&gt;Then we will really pay for it.

What I'm waiting for is, &quot;Sir, your DNA says that you're 25% more likely
than average to get cancer, so your health insurance premium will be
$1,000 a month.&quot;

Bus content: Insurance on my Bus is only about $100 every 6 months, but
that's just state-mandated minimums, no comprehensive.  Never had to
file a claim for the Bus.
