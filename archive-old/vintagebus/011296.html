Hi Gene,
Remember to try to turn frozen bolts and screws in the tighten direction a 
bit when compleatly frozen against loosening.  Then when you try to loosen it 
again the bolt/screw hopefully will have shifted slightly when you tried to 
tighten it, and now will loosen because you had broken the friction holding 
it in there.  Sounds wierd, but it works!  Eric&amp;Barb
