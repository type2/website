Greetings list

Thank you all for the responses to my questions.

I feel a bit stoooooopid about the engine stand question as I must have
seen the bell housing bolted to a frame solution at 5 or 6 Volkswagen
garages over the years. A case of hitting the send button before
feferring to my onboard resources.

I'm glad to hear that the front seat swap is an easy can do. I'm 6' 3&quot;
so any extra leg room and more windscreen view will be most welcome
(Scott I promise that this wasn't a belated April fool's joke!).

The bench seat thing isn't an total train smash but I figure that seeing
as the double cab is going to be used mainly for driving long distances
on holiday comfort is going to come before originality.

I went into the restorer's shop today and the foreman fell about
appologising for the crappy finish. He all but admitted that after doing
the faultless sheet metal replacement his boss decided that too much
time had been spent and told him to get it out of the shop pronto. So at
that point he just aimed a spray gun at the load bay and interior and
let rip.

Fortunately the body shop is about 20 miles or so from the showroom and
the owner never goes in so the foreman fellow is pretty much
independant. He said he would put one worker onto my bug list full time
and call me round to inspect only when he was satisfied.

BTW Bill all medicine is welcome and freighters are a great way to
travel so haul yer ass on down south.

Later
