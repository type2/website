From about 1961-71 the VW bus uses the same dampener/silencer.  From 1959ish 
to 1967 the same tailpipe tip.
 
&lt;&lt;Between the frame, the axle tube, and the heater box, I can just barely get 
my fingertips on the wing nut on the clutch cable.  Is there a trick I do not 
know or is it supposed to be this difficult?&gt;&gt;
Best way of attack is to lay uner the bus just forward of the left rear 
wheel.  Reach up and over the axle tube to get you left hand on it.

&lt;&lt; (BTW, the nut appears to be rusted solid onto the cable, so I am pulling 
the engine anyway :-( &gt;&gt;
If it is rusted on you might be best off cutting the cable and just 
installing a new greased up one!  Eric&amp;Barb
