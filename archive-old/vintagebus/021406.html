Hi Brian,
From what you describe it sounds like you really need to just completely go 
through the wiring and get it setup correctly by the colors of the wires!  
Then polarize the generator, recharge the battery and check the voltage 
getting to the solinoid.  It could your starter needs new brushes, but it 
easily could be any of the wiring and connections going from the battery to 
the fuse box, to the ignition switch, and back to the solinoid or it could be 
just the ignition switch.   Eric&amp;Barb
