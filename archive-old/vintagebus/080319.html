Subject: Re: [VB] what tool for manifold nuts?

Ya, I was talking about single port.  I'd use silicone on the DP set up too.  
I don't bother using goo with the round cross section copper circle crush 
gaskets, but someone else said they used some sort of gaskacinch goo stuff... 
couldn't hurt...

running the engine. I also use Permatex silver anti-sieze on the threads
of the studs, to protect them from rusting, siezing up. Makes it easy to
undo them next time. Looking at Clara's words again, my manifolds/heads
are TWO-port; if yours are single, then probably omit the silicone sealer
- those round copper gaskets are your seals. Seams down (right Clara?).
