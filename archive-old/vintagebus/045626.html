Subject: Crew cab Tilt wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Looking for the canvas for a crew cab tilt.  Have the bows already just need 
the canvas.  Reproduction canvas okay if similar to original but original 
preferred.  Have cash or complete bay widow tilt (cab height, fits a split) 
to trade.  Please Pmail.

What is the current standing of PLF?  Heard good, heard bad.

Thanks,
Dan
