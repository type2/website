&gt;Hi Aaron,
&gt;Rubber is never basicly the same!  There are so many types of rubber and ways
&gt;some manufactures stretch thier expensive materials by mixing in cheap
&gt;filler!  Such as clay!

Another common practice is to take all the scrap lying (also known as 
regrind) around and blend it in with the resin used to make the parts. The 
problem with this is that every time rubber (or plastic) gets put through 
the extruder it degrades more.  Although not all fillers are a bad thing, 
as they are sometimes used to make the rubber more durable, flexible, 
resistant to fuel.....


&gt;  Take body rubber EDM is the best and resists UV-rays
&gt;very well and last ten years or more without cracking.  On the otherhand
&gt;cheap rubber often from the far East with it's filler materials will tend to
&gt;crack badly in 6-12 months!


I'm experimenting with using vitamin E oil to prevent this. Vitamin E is an 
antioxidant used in the plastics industry to combat parts becoming brittle 
from exposure to the elements. (I should know more in a few months as I 
should have a weatherometer by then and be able to do some accelerated testing)

&gt;   The German fuel line with it's cloth covering is easily identifiable.  The
&gt;non-name rubber fuel line at your FLAPS is not.  Where did it come from?  Who
&gt;knows!

I agree, and for that reason I only use non-jacketed line that I have 
bought from a reputable source. (I buy mine from Cole-Parmer Scientific)


&gt;The cloth covering on the German fuel line actually helps to protects
&gt;the rubber from hardening/cracking due to engine oil and ozone from the
&gt;generator.  The same thing happens to the engine wiring harness.  The wires
&gt;exposed to the engine atmosphere have thier insulation harden and crack
&gt;easily after about five to ten years.  The engine wires inside the plastic
&gt;sheeth of the wiring harness on the other hand stay like new!  So the ends of
&gt;the German fuel line show thier aging at the exposed ends by cracking before
&gt;the rest of the fuel line gets dangerously brittle.

The only problem I have with jacketed lines is that I can't visually 
inspect them along their entire length.
