Subject: Re: [VB] Engine mount

How strange - I fought with this EXACT problem tonight for about an 
hour, after finally putting in my new motor,  and finally gave up.  I 
thought  my 17mm ratcheting wrench would work, but there is barely 
enough clearance to get one click.  I'm going to try every socket 
extension combo I have tomorrow, and then I'll try the allen head idea. 
  Luckily,  have a place down the road called &quot;The Nutty Company&quot; that 
has just about every nut and bolt you can imagine.

Any other tricks for keeping the clutch arm out of the way while 
working alone?  I'm thinking some kind of coat hanger set up might work.
