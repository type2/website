Subject: Re: 21-window hacking talk
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 1998 01:25:50 PDT



&gt;It's funny to listen/read all this talk of the moral issues surrounding 
the hacking of a 21-window bus, especially when it came out of a note I 
posted reporting on *restoration* progress. When I'm done, this will be 
the fourth bus I've rescued in as many years. Two I fixed to drivers and 
sold (at a financial loss; knowledge gain) and the third I drive 
everyday. 
&gt;
You know this bus rescue thing has a silly way of biting you in the 
butt. I have rescued many busses headed to destruction. But the rewards 
have been difficult to live with for the most part. As you mentioned, I 
too have sold busses at a loss, and some break even, and others I 
actually came out ahead. BUT, I have found some of those back at 
junkyards, victims of poor judgement by the new owners. Modifications 
that caused fires, roll overs, and accidents top the list. I am not the 
greatest at making good looking busses (I dont cut any), but I can make 
them mechanically sound, and then some one thinks they have a better 
idea on how to make them fast, or cool, or whatever, and wham!
I do feel good about one bus, a 67 from my hometown that had been 
rolled, in a fire, sat for years, and rusted. No longer driveable, the 
salvage metal has ended up in busses from Oly, to New York, to a feature 
bus (from Canada) in a VW mag. So although another dead, parts of it 
live on. And what would have happened if I had just given up on it that 
cold winter it broke down on the interstate, with no one willing to pay 
for a tow for it? I found someone who would take that scrap and pass it 
on. I don't know where I am going with this, but it touched a nerve. I 
guess this is what keeps me going....
