374-  us specs
  081 - walk through    (does your sliding drivers seat have the adjustment
handle on the side?)

UH- imported to port 'H' in the USA

What do you want from 'registering it' ?   there are various registries.
Just for collecting info pretty much.  The only one that  makes info
available to people for info is the one on Thom listemeister's website.
