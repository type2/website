G'day again from 90' South!

Well, the deal on purchasing a '74 Thing is nearly done. Now only one
problem ;( I need to get it from Churchville, PA to Asheville, NC no
later than 5/31/01.

If anyone is up for a road trip, heading south, or has a car carrier,
I'll be happy to pay for any and all expenses. It's tough sorting stuff
like this out when you 10,000 miles away from home.

I picked up a Ghia convertible on my way home from the ice last time. I
picked it up at night. Probably a good thing. &quot;Scary&quot; is the main word
I'd use to describe the drive back to NC. Point is, though, I made it. 
Adventure is where you find it ;)

Off to check the power plant, I'm on watch tonight. One thing you don't
want is for the lights to go out when it's -65F below with windchill
around -112F.

cheers ya'll!

Dean
