Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and Harbor Freight

A little late - I've been too busy to read the list regularly these days!
The bus still hasn't been worked on, but runs the local weekly errands.
Now it needs a good 205T distributor, one in which the drive shaft has all
its washers and very little vertical play. Anyone got one in good shape?
