I can't figure out how to pmail using the FindMail on the net,
can't determine your email address, so here goes a public answer.

Not that I'm an expert, but it seems that everything has been
replaced, yet the problem remains.   My guess is that  the 
alignment of the pulleys is off plane.  Both the pulley on the
engine and the generator MUST be on the same plane, or
the forces would generate some side loads that none of the
components are designed for.  Some questions that need to 
be answered.  I don't know the answers:

Is the generator stand matched to generator outside diameter?
Is it an alternator sitting on a generator stand or vice versa?
Are the centers of the pulleys aligned with each other along their axis?
Are the diameters of the pulleys twisted in relation to each other?
Have you been using the same generator stand for all combinations of
engine and generator?  If so, the generator stand may be the culprit, 
as it determines the alignment, I think.  Machined into the unit, not
really adjustable.

Suggestion, I haven't done this, don't know if it would work, it should.
Cut a piece of flat board to sorta match the pulley sizes and shapes
in one single piece of board.  Cut out holes for bolt heads if need be. 
Place against bottom pulley. Is the spacing between the top pulley and 
board the same all around the top pulley?  If not they are out of
alignment.  
Remember that the thickness of the pulleys may be different, 
resulting in different spacing between center of pulley and where board
fits. 
If things are aligned, the spacing around the pulley will be the same.  
Even if the spacing is the same, check if the belt is parallel to the
board, 
if not, the axis' are not aligned.

Don't know how to correct, but this may help in diagnosis.

I thought about using cardboard, but it has inherent twist/bend, use
plywood.

I have a '71 bus that I have owned and enjoyed for the last eight years
or so. It is on its second engine rebuild since I have
owned it - actually, the engine in it now is a total replacement, as the
old case was cracked under the oil cooler. Which brings
me to my point of puzzlement...

This thing eats generator pulleys. Tears them up where the shaft goes
through. I have a whole collection of trashed pulleys accumulated over
the years. I have been through three different generators
and have changed fans, all to no avail. I figured that the problem would
go away with the new engine, but NO! The darned
thing went out again on a recent road trip, causing the engine to
severely overheat, as the generator light was not functioning
properly. AAAARRRGH!!!!

I keep the belt tension adjusted as recommended and do not have any
extreme driving habits. This is a stock 1600DP. Has
anyone else encountered this problem before? The VW heads that I have
talked to are all puzzled by this phenomenon. I have
used german pulleys, brazilian, and whatever else was available - it
eats them all equally well.
