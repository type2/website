Subject: VW logo tattoo

As part of my ever approaching mid-life crisis, I was considering a VW logo tattoo directly next to my Yin-Yang (it's a tattoo on my leg, gutter mind!)  Any of you legal types out there think that VWoA would issue me a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order if I did this?!?!?!



Peace, John Baker
