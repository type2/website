Hi everybody, got a question, what is an anschriftenplatte? I bought an NOS
dealer holder from the 60's for one of these and now I would like to locate
one. I dont remember ever seeing one in the 15 years I have been messing
with vw's . Does anyone have a picture or one they would part with, I would
like to complete this dealer holder with one and put it in my 67 westy. Also
my holder is blue and says kundendienstheft on the front, what does that
mean? Thanks.
Brian Hudson
