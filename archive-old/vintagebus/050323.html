Well, you remember the '59 Euro SC I told you about. It looks like I'm
gonna be getting a '57 single cab to go with it. It's not euro (has the
bullet signals). I don't really have the space or need, I just couldn't
pass up the price. I&quot;ll probably end up selling one of them. I'm out in
west texas. If you think you might be interested, let me know and we'll
keep in touch. I'll post pictures ASAIGT.
