Aye, there's the rub: people react differently to &quot;want&quot; vs &quot;need&quot; - you're
more likely to give a homeless person a ham sandwich than a beanie babie;
he *needs* the sandwich; he may *want* the beanie baby.  The &quot;daily driver
bus&quot; aspect seems to be intended to a) pry loose parts from people who may
not be intending to sell, because in general people don't want to sell to
someone they know is going to sell again; they'd rather sell to the &quot;end
user&quot; and cut out the middle man; b) people tend to give a price break to
the guy actually using the part.  People have &quot;kicked down&quot; bits for me to
use on my buses; they would not have done so if they thought I was
intending to resell same parts.   In one case, I didn't use the freebie
part, but passed on the karma by giving the part away to someone else who
needed it.  I've also kicked down parts myself to people who needed bits
and I knew they weren't just building up inventory.  And if they can't use
the part, I'd hope that they'd pass on the karma by giving it to someone
who could.

&gt;ya- I dont think there is anything wrong with buying parts to put together a 
&gt;62 bus that you are planning to sell.   Then someone can buy a fairly 
&gt;complete, functioning bus, who would not have the time  or energy to put t 
&gt;together, and hopefully this means a few buses are dragged out of the
fields  
&gt;or junkyards and saved- put back in use.     I think that is a good thing.   
&gt;But why say it is for a daily driver when it is for a fixer upper to sell?
