Subject: Was location, now 5AFN370

Hi
	As we have all admitted where we are, and there seem to be a lot of us in
California, I wondered if anyone here knew any of the history of my bus.  It
is a 1967 11 window camper, now in Scotland but came from Chula Vista,
California in 2004.  It had a really shabby camping interior, is red an
white, had a strange double window louvered window which had necessitated
removal of one of the window pillars.  When I removed this the condition of
the paint beneath it suggested it had been there since new.  The
registration mark when I bought it was 5AFN370.  Any information on its
history would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Russell Mowat
