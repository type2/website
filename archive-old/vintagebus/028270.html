I use Dupli-Color New Ford Gray. It is very close in shade and color. It is not perfect but not noticeable unless next to a stock tank. I get mine at NAPA. It is a really good paint with an above average spray tip
for rattle can. As far as flattening agents, my 73 Thing has a flattening agent added to it. The Things were originally a semi-gloss. It is a real pain. Any finger prints or grease really stick to it. I would have
definitely lived with the non-original gloss.
Hope this helps,
