Subject: transmission update...

been working on a '64 tranny destined for the '65...

hogged out a type I tranny case for a shift fork jig, leaving the ribs
intact for strength...
finally started back on track, locating parts I laid aside months ago.
gear stacks and intermediate case went together and into the jig with
minor protests from the reverse gear assembly.... resistance was quelled
and I set about adjusting the shift forks.
I should have removed more material in a few places, but I was able to
get the job done without any wrench modification. similar clearances
between the synchronizer assemblies
and the drive gears on either side were easily had with shift rails in
neutral.
and i was happy with where the reverse gear ended up when engaged...
stacks pressed out... and bound for the original case.
I had (luckily) two tranny gasket sets... I broke one
intermediate-housing-to-main-case gasket installing the works in the
jig-case, and so had to cannibalize the pristine extra set of gaskets
for the necessary item.
red-siliconed the thin gasket well with gloved hands, and had it
together just shy of 4 AM, or thereabouts a few days ago.
all my snap-ring pliers were at work so i had to wait until tonight to
put the differential housing reverse gear on the diff side of the
reverse gear shaft....
I toyed with the ring gear assembly for a while. I ended up deciding to
replace the differential carrier bearings, since their end play was IMHO
excessive....
the only really *bad* thing about the tranny/axle assembly was the
reduction box bearings.... the upper-outers revolted and trashed their
nylon (?) spacers and growled ever-loudly for God knows how long....
I think these harmonics traveled back up the axles and wailed 'gainst
the carrier bearings and worked their wiles in bad ways.
and so I'm left with growly (oiled, turning with hand-power...) carrier
bearings.
SKF 6015, if I am recalling correctly.
found several places on the 'net that have online bearing catalogs....
(a net-search for &quot;bearing catalog, online&quot; will yield similar results
if you so desire....)
the ones I need on either side of the carrier are slightly over 50$
apiece.
100$ and some change more for insurance.
I've already spent several hundred on redux bearings and gaskets and
effort to get this far... this much more is a pittance, relatively.
so I pressed the left side carrier bearing off of the differential
carrier... used an 8-dowel drill jig (fit the carrier) and a 36 mm
socket (to take up distance between the press head and the base) to
press the bearing off....
the other side will require more arcane methods.
I have been meaning to acquire a set of bearing separators for some
time.
but even they will not slip behind the bearing closest to the ring gear,
due to the ring gear retaining bolts. I don't really want to remove them
and disturb a nice original safety-wiring job... I can see it now...
&quot;For Sale: '65 VW Type II, original ring gear safety wire, EZ Camper
pkg, MS, MB, MT, etc....&quot;
ah well.
If I can get the new bearings in hand soon I may just weld a few bolts
on the old bearing and use the steering wheel puller easily enough...
otherwise I'll dig in and get a slide puller set with all the goodies
and do it that way.
later....
