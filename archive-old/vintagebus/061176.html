Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] A/C for a Baywindow

Matt, list,

Unless you're hauling huge butter sculptures there's no 
real need to cool everything in a bus. 
I finally have a working prototype of a &quot;cool seat&quot;. 
Sewed some vinyl tubing to a removeable seat pad back, 
added some valves and such and plumbed it to a 
submersible 12v pump that's dropped in an ice chest of 
you know what. It does one thing, removes heat from the 
occupant's backs and puts it in the ice chest. My 
commute is only 10 minutes so no long range tests have 
been done yet. The long drive to Jerome will be a good 
test in a month and a half. 

Speaking of vehicles baking in the sun, see 
www.solarcooking_dot_org for plans to build a sun oven that 
will get to 400f with free energy!

&gt; In that post, I worked out that it would take around 3130 Btu to
&gt; change the temperature of the air and sheet metal in the back of
&gt; the Bus by 43 degrees C.  My guesstimate was that doing the whole
&gt; Bus would add 15% to 30% - let's be conservative and say 15% or
&gt; 3600 Btu.  In the original example I was heating the Bus from 
&gt; -18 C to 25 C (0 F to 77 F), but the same numbers would apply
&gt; for cooling a Bus from 60 C to 17 C (140 F to a chilly 63 F).
&gt; In case 140 F sounds like a lot, a little Googling revealed
&gt; http://www.marlowesvets_dot_com/newssummer02.htm in which a car
&gt; parked in 72 F weather in mid-May 2002 _in the UK_ had an
&gt; interior temperature of 137 F.
&gt; 
&gt; The Btu needed are directly proportional to the temperature
&gt; change, so if you only wanted to cool the Bus to 25 C (77 F),
&gt; you can multiply all the Btu numbers by 35/43 or about 0.8.
