Subject: Re: [VB]  bently bus manual - new low price found

&gt;if anybody needs the bently manual , they have it at JC whitney for $58.99,
&gt;which is a really good price( i was told when i bought mine for $90 plus
&gt;that that was a good  price,  HA!)


I though it was good too, until I looked at at their shipping charge -
$12!!  They make up for low prices my marking up the shipping charges.

I got mine on Ebay for $59.65, plus $6 shipping, new in wrapper.

According to BestBookBuys_dot_com, its available from Borders for $70.42,
including shipping.  Here's the URL for the search:
