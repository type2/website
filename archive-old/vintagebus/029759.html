Subject: Interior door panel Q (65 Samba)

Currently, I am under the impresion that the rear cargo area door panels
were the plain board w/ paint ona deluxe bus.  I have been looking at
some pictures of original bus interiors and am wondering if that is
correct.  Could it be that the lower hardboard in the cargo area had the
same material as the upper portion of the rest of the door panels?  This
would mean that it would also get the trim beading stapled to the top of
the panel.  Anyone????  I also think that the upper cargo panel (21
wondow) was not covered and was painted grey. (Grey S&amp;P interior)

Any help out there?

Thanks
Matt
