Hi Dominic,
 1400 Lbs. rating is a bit too low!  As for size of tire the 205/75R15 will 
fit 1955-67 buses, and anything bigger than a 205/75R15 up to 235/75R15 will 
fit in the rear wheel wells used from the very late 62 models through the end 
of 67 or those earlier buses with the cut out rear wheel wells.  Of course 
the bigger the rear tire the higher the MPH in fourth is at the same RPM as 
with smaller rear tires.   Eric&amp;Barb
