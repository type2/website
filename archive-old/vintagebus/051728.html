&lt;&lt; Has anyone found a source for correct grey masonite or ? for early bus 
door and kick panels?   &gt;&gt;

Hi Chris&amp;Gina,
Try Wolfsburg West or just by thier door panels.  Just make sure to paint the 
side of the panels that go against the doors with an oil type paint to seal 
them.  Plus install the plastic to keep the inner door water drippings off 
the interior door panels and back into the bottom of the doors.    Eric&amp;Barb
