&gt; late bus parts ?
go to www.bus-boys_dot_com i havent seen them here on the list in a while, but
they still exists im pretty sure.

They sell an irsII kit that uses late bus suspension.  68-71 spring
plates, 68-79 rear bearing housings hubs axles etc. can be run at stock
height (so can the beetle based kits but they wont tell you that)

It is planned to work with an IRS bug tranny.. but i have been wondering
if an irs bus tranny will fit too as you can put an irs bus tranny in a
bug and you can put a bug tranny in a split bus ergo it would seem that
there would be a way to put an irs bus tranny in a split, but no-one has
answered me on that one...

As far as matching up bolt patterns, they sell small 5 to wide 5 adapters
at wolfgang, must be used with 15 inch wheels, but they are sturdy. I have
a friend that used to haul TONS of stuff in his bus literally cross
country on those and they held up fine.

take care,

Steve
