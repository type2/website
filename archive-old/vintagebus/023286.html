The path of least resistance would be to get a set of the brazilian ones,
and a set of the make-up pieces that kelly sells, and have your body guy
fix 'em up.  Your chances of finding really nice 3-piece doglegs are
slender.  Isn't you bus 10/56 or so?  Does it have 3-piece doglegs now?

&gt;Im in serious need for somepre-62 doglegs and a pre-62 right rocker.
&gt;If *ANYONE* has something at *ANY* price, please email me.
&gt;Also, I'm making the trip form Ventura, Ca. to Busses by the bridge/Lake 
&gt;Havasu City, Az. so if anyone needs some stuff moved, p-mail me.
&gt;I'm traveling 101S, 134E, 210E, 10E, 95N and leaving sometime Thursday 
&gt;night/Friday morning. Reverse order Sunday Afternoon.
&gt;Also if you see a rusty primered 57 standard stranded on the side of the 
&gt;road, feel free to honk, wave, and laugh, hey, maybe even stop. =)
