&lt;&lt; Why are you guys bothering with dropping resistors on your wiper motors? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Reason one is we live up where wipers are a must for 6-9 months of the year.  
Number two is that we have gone through our share of wiper motors trying what 
you propose and have fried too many that way.  Having your wipers running at 
stock speed gives you far quieter running wipers.  Setting up the wiper 
blades so they tilt the proper amount each direction so they wipe properly in 
both directions and using Rain-X is truely far better for visabilty than 
spasticly flopping wipers from hell.:)    Eric&amp;Barb
