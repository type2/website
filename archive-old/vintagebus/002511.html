Subject: secret stash?
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2000 22:03:04 -0800

There's this hole under my driver's seat - I hear it's for the jack and
tools. I've only been in wrist deep. But what's on the other side? I can't
find a hole under the passenger seat. It looks the same from above and
below. Is this some secret hidden compartment? What's in there? A time
capsule? Old German air? A stash of NOS spare parts? A puddle of water?
Hmmm...
