:  There are reportedly some pix of a pretty good looking Deluxe bus in the

That would be the April issue, the Spring Break pictorial.  Three
shots:

- page 75: left side.  spare tire on front, with white vinyl cover.  the bus
  is white on dark blue.  Lots of '60s-ish flowers on the body and
  rear side windows, probably applique.  has curtains in the rear
  luggage area.  has fish-eye signals, plus reflectors on the bottoms
  of the front doors (these look like vanagon turn indicators,
  actually).  has the kind of squarish plastic airscoops, also painted
  blue.  hard to see the bulk of the side, some women got in the way
  of the shot.  looks to be at stock ride height.

- page 76, slightly left of rear.  no license plate in the license
  plate area (although the text implies the bus was driven there) -
  could be in the rear window; can't tell because the hatch is open.
  has backup lights.  third brake light mounted at the top of the rear
  window.  there are also three flowers in the rear window (seems like
  a cop would get grumpy about that).  no over-riders on the bumper.
  push-button engine latch.  can't quite tell if it has the interior
  seats or not - could go either way, since this is apparently
  intended as a party bus.

- page 82, right side looking forward.  more women in the way.  nicely
  restored panels on the side and passenger door, grey and what i'd
  call slate blue (similar to the outside paint, but more subdued).
  more flowers in the windows.  can't see any more of the interior.


:  Naturally, since I only subscribe to VW mags, I
:  wouldn't actually know....my wife told me!

Despite what another list member implied, I know of several women that
subscribe.  The claim is that it's for the articles.  In some cases, I
even believe them.
