Subject: Re: [VB] N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value


Good to know albeit a little surprising to see something official.  Do they 
publish to the Web or is this NADA guide only a hard copy thing?

&gt;Subject: [VB] N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value
&gt;Date: Thu, 6 Dec 2001 08:37:12 -0800
&gt;
&gt;    Just got back from MVD to register my 15 window and got the shock of my
&gt;life. N.A.D.A. recognizes the real value of our buses now. For those that
&gt;don't know N.A.D.A. is like kelley blue book and is what insurance
&gt;companies, dealers set the selling and insured values of our buses at.
&gt;According to NADA my 15 window is worth 6100 low and 14100 finished, my DC
&gt;4525 low and 11950 high, my DD panel 4300 low and 11150 high and my westy
&gt;5920 low and 14550 high. So it appears that the Westy camper is the most
&gt;valuable of all model buses. All these prices are for 1960 buses and the
&gt;book goes back to 1956. They value a 1956 Deluxe at 16400.  All these 
&gt;prices
&gt;come from a survey of what has sold, insurance companies , etc.
