I quit buying on ebay ages ago due to the extremely high prices, but what a
great place to get rid of worthless junk at a high price.

ps, i guess i told a fib, I did buy the spot light that was mentioned on the
list, that was for sale on ebay, but for 9 buckos i couldn't go wrong and it
is awesome,and the shipping was cheap.

Todd is dead on.  I just recently started selling a few things and I have to
