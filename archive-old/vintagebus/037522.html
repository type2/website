  It's 4-track alright. It looks just like a saphire radio. I'll take a picture 
of it this week and stick it on my website.
  A friend of mine that worked for a dealer told me you could buy 4-track tapes 
straight from the VW Dealer way back when. He also said that a guy came by his 
shop and saw a 4-track player and asked what it was. He told him about it and 
this guy says. &quot;Man, I wish I'd have come over 2 weeks ago. I just threw away a 
punch of those tapes&quot;. He even had a 4-track recorder set up to copy stuff. 
They wouldn't fit in his old 8-track so he pitched them. Bummer.
