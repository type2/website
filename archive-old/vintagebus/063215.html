Subject: loose oil drain cover studs correction

------=_NextPart_000_0066_01C25383.F562CFB0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The whole stud came out of one hole with nut attached and will not =
tighten, is this a striped stud?  I have two extra oil pans if this is =
the case.  Is it very hard to change the pan?
It does not seem to be a striped nut, but two striped studs.
Any help would be appreciated.  By the way this is the first time I =
change the oil in this bus, it is newly acquired.


Thanks,
BB
