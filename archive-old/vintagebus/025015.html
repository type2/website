Sorry Eric...you are wrong, wrong, wrong, with a capital &quot;W&quot;.

For one thing, yes I do know what a bastard motor looks like.  I have
one sitting in front of me everyday in my shop.  Second, don't make
judgments on other folks 'authority' from just an email posted to a list
on the net...you have no idea what I know or what I own or have owned.
Making these assumptions you look foolish doing so when you are
wrong...and you are.

Next here is your &quot;proof&quot;, my `60 westys numbers...these were also
cleared through VW as correct.

-613 973 Chassis number
-3536632 Engine number
-5-`60 dated oil bath (identical in every aspect to a 2-`58 dated oil
bath I also have)

### Thanks to Neil Picket on the date code info on this oil bath
business.  Looks like that settles this dispute once and for all.

For more proof and some pics eric...

Charlie Hammill (most folks know who he is) has (or had?) a very low
mileage `60 double door panel with an original bastard motor...same air
cleaner as mine a 36hp style, identical.  There is pictures of this
(charlie's) bus in the VW soft cover book called &quot;Classic Volkswagens&quot;
by Colin Burnham...`88
Osprey publishing. Page 121 shows the bus and bastard engine with the
same oil bath as mine.  If you know Charlie he has (had) probably the
finest collection of buses in existence and is very picky about
correctness.  He says that was the correct oil bath.  That is what was
on his and what was on mine.

Eric if that is not proof enough I will take digital pictures for you
and post them to the net for everyone to see.  The engine and number,
the bus and number, the 36 hp style oil bath dated 5-`60.

Need I say more?

Todd

&gt; &lt;&lt; The air cleaner is the same as 36 motors...maybe a differnt
&gt;  sticker on it but that is it.  I have pictures and original owners
&gt;  manual if you need proof. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt; The problem of using the owners manuals for exact info on the engine
&gt; especially right after a major change is that the bus pictured often was a
&gt; proto type for that model year or pictured before the particular part was
&gt; manufactured.  Remember that these owners manuals had to be made before the
&gt; bus was produced since they had to photograph, set up the owners manual and
&gt; have it printed,   Plus the added mess that VW wanted to save money so they
&gt; did not reshoot all of the photos used in each years manual and so used
&gt; photos of earlier engines.
&gt;   Definitely interesting to hear that the engine in your 1960 has the 36HP
&gt; style, but it could have been taken off during engine removal for clutch
&gt; replacement and mixed up at the shop with the earlier air cleaner.  Also when
&gt; was your 1960 westie actually manufactured?
&gt;    If you have that bus book from England that recently came out with lots of
&gt; wierd European campers shown.  There is a neat factory color drawing of a
&gt; Bastard 40HP engine.  You can tell it is a Bastard 40HP engine by the raised
&gt; areas of on the head tin where the #1&amp;2, plus #3&amp;4 are stamped in the sheet
&gt; metal is raised about 1/2&quot; like a bad set of shoulder pads in a good suit.
&gt; The air cleaner is the correct one for the Bastard 40HP engine and is not a
&gt; 36HP aircleaner.  We will see if we can find more info on this later this
&gt; week.   Eric&amp;Barb
