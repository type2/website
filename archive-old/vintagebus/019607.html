&gt; &lt;&lt;  tried them out today with not too many problems. Due to my Panels
&gt; lowered height I had to make brackets that mount the tent to the rack
&gt; instead of the roof. Because of this I have to lengthen the poles that
&gt; mount to the bumpers, but otherwise I'm looking good. Look for me and my
&gt; new tent at Kelly Park. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Just run it in the stock location and let it drag the ground.
&gt; Haven't you seen the raver (I called em &quot;housers&quot;)kids and their SUUUUUPER 
&gt; baggy pants covering their shoes?
&gt; Thats the latest STYLE!!!!!!!!!!
