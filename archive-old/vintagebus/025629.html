I beg all of you &quot;cobbling&quot; together a westy interior to cobble the later
versions.  Those of us looking for the correct 64- 67 Westy interior parts
(SO-42, SO-44) for our busses thank you!!  One sure way to tell the age of a
Z- bed anyway is to look at the brass tag nailed to the lower left corner of
the z-bed base.  It will have the serial # and the year the bed (indeed the
entire kit) came from.

BTW I have a nice Z bed out of a 70 Westy for CHEEP if anyone wants to come
and get it.  I'm in Orange County CA

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My selfish intent would be that I'm going to cobble together a cheapo
&gt; &gt; conversion for my Kombi. Apology in advance for this bastardization of a
&gt; &gt; vintage bus but my beloved Kombi will never be a trailer/show queen.
