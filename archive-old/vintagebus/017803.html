well, as most of you seem to be going to jerome i spent the day working on the
bus...some basic stuff, but good to get it done. changes
oil/sparks/contacts/rotor etc.

i tried cleaning the oil bath air cleaner, as per the library, i guess it
wasn't as dirty as i imagined it, the kerosene didn't really get too dirty
with the cleaning...

i finished the grounding of the tailights that i started this summer(well not
quite finished)...i put one of those loop connectors on the end of the wire to
the ground, before it was just the bare wire wrapped around the screw. Seems
like a cleaner connection this way. I still need to solder the grounds to the
tailights....someday, probably next time they seem to be getting dim.
Currently they are just wrapped around the housing.

i finished the soldering of the headlight switch...what a bear. I printed out
the additional instructions from Eric and Barb, sat down read them, read them
again, looked at the switch, read them again, looked a tthe switch, read them
again, finally i understood what they were talking about, and i finished the
soldering. I had previously soldered inside the switch, but not on the
outside...when I hooked it back up, no lights. This isa fun job to do
yourself. 
diconnect ground, attach headlight switch, connect ground, turn on headlights,
get out of car, check headlights, no go, disconnect ground, disconnect switch,
take switch apart, find out what you did wrong, this took all day...for some
reason the housing of the switch was shorting it out, i tried the switch
without the housing, and it worked fine. I think i may have just done a messy
soldering job, so i cleaned that up, and everything eventually worked.

the goals of this light project were multi... i didn;t want my wires to melt
from the overheating switch, brighter headlights, i wanted the red light in
the speedo to stop glowing at night, i also wanted to add some other
electrical devices to the bus and thought i should get the electrical system
in its best shape. The red light still has a very very faint glow-much dimmer
than before. It seems to get a little brighter when i rev the engine...what
could this indicate? bad regulator?

one really odd ball thing, while testing my system today-i think my battery
may be 12 volt. But everything on the bus is 6V. Currently the only odd
electrical thing on my bus seems to be that there is a fuse between the radio
and the headlight switch. I thought everything would have been fried by now if
i was using a 12 v battery in a 6 v bus? is my voltmeter broken? i have had
this auto battery for 2 years(installed by PO) i can't see any markings on it
as to voltage...

Next i put some tar sealant on the window seal(that goes on the body) of the
window to my closet. It always seemed to leak when it rained, about a month
ago i noticed that someone installed backwards, i don't remember if it was me
or the previous owner. I reversed it, but it kept leaking so i tried the
tar..i'll let you all know if it works.
