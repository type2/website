I had dual 34 PDSIT carbs on my 1776 on the trike for over a year and
never had any problems. Right now I have a Holley 5200 progressive and
it requires more attention than the duals.

No, what's funny is when people who don't have dual carbs think those of

us who do spend so much time on them. Just for the record, I don't spend

any more time tuning my bus with dual carbs than I do tuning my truck
which has a single carb. I rarely fool with the carbs on either one.

I like my electronic ignition too. 8^)
