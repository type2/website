Subject: Re: Vacuum assisted brakes

 Hi Rocky,
  I have added vacuum assisted disc brakes to the front on my '61 Westy.  I
used a kit to adapt the discs to the stock beam.  All the other parts are from
a '73 Bus including the booster.  It's all in the fabrication, I switched the
damper to the pass. side, fabricated an offset mounting unit to move/mount the
booster/master cyl. back away from the beam(you can not mount the booster/MC
unit directly on the beam as on a '73) because the tie rod on the drivers side
will hit the booster.  Extended the brake actuating rod to reach the booster.
I run dual Kadrons so I tapped vacuum off the balance tube.  The remote
reservoir is mounted behind the front seat.  Brake lines are all new and moved
accordingly.

 Bacically that's the fabrication that's necessary all else is normal
replacement procidure.  It took alot of time to accomplish.  Also I checked
three different used vacuum units and they ALL were bad so i had to buy a new
one app. $200 just for it.  I don't use a pedal pan here in Az.

HTH

PS. by the way the brakes are fantastic!
