&gt;I was looking at pictures of San Antonio's &quot;own&quot; Mike Gensler's '58 SC
&gt;(&quot;Zorm&quot;) the other night.
&gt;http://lonestar.texas_dot_net/~gensler/zorm/zrm3-298.JPG  That SOB has
&gt;semaphores!  How COOL is that?......I was floored.  How did that happen?  I
&gt;knew the SC that I just got HAS to be older (older is cooler, ha, ha) than
&gt;Mike's but I guess he has an unusual deal.  I was hoping they ran sema's
&gt;later on trucks than buses.   Guess not.   Lucky Mike!
&gt;
Why are the semaphores installed so low on the Pick-up?  My '54 and a '57
I've seen have them in the same place as full-size Buses, up high right
above the beltline, i.e.:
