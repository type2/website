YOu can use a wheel cylinder honer, and some folx report that they
get a better, tighter fit that way, but it takes a while.

I use the reamer by hand - it doesn't actually take that many turns
to get the bushing cut, and I take incrementally larger passes.

&gt; is the same tool (different size) you would use for the king and link pins.  
&gt; Could you use a wheel cylinder honer instead?
