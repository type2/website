Subject: 66 Bus Questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all, 

New to this list!  I have a few questions to pose to the experts here.  I 
looked at a 66 bus for sale near me.  It's real straight, has rust but not 
terminal rust.  No accident damage.  It originally is a camper of some sort.  
However, the interior is missing rearwards of the drivers seat.  It has the 
exterior electrical outlet in front of the rear wheelwell on the driver's 
side.  It has 3 crank-opening windows (horizontal pieces) on each side with 
approximately 1/2 inch wood trim around them on the inside.  It is not a walk 
through and has the cab divider.  No pop top.  Would this be a Sundial 
camper?  

Thanks,
Mike Fritz
