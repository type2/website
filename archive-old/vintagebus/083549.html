Subject: Re: [VB] Piston Rings

Hi Seth,
If the rings are going then the rest of the mystery engine is  suspect.  
Better to rebuild it completely.  Otherwise if you install  new P&amp;Cs, and rebuilt 
heads the main and rod bearings are often worn to the  point that they can not 
take the new extra pressures and the bearing fail.   Plus if the cylinders 
have worn in, they will not work on the rebuilt engine due  to slight changes.
  Whichever way you go check that your carb is not running too rich  and 
washing the oil from the piston rings.  In other words, no lubrication,  rings 
wear out prematurely.
