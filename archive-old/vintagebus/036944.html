Hi,
You really should go this way and instead of the garbage bag (Too thin.).  Use
4 or 6 Mil. thick plastic.  While the Por 15 idea will help it will not direct
the water into the bottom of the doors and out the drains that were designed
there for this purpose.  Instead the water will get under your floor mat and
slowly rust it out when only using the Por 15 on the backs of the door panels.
The buses came originally from the factory with a vapor/drip barrier there
made of a oil/wax paper, and the bug/KG used the same till the early 1960 when
they went to the plastic in thier doors.                Eric &amp; Barb
