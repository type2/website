I believe the body bumpers were aftermarket/dealer installed accessory, not a 
factory option.

&lt;&lt;Does anyone have a list of what options were available for barndoor busses. 
 
I've been told that M-codes didn't exist at that time, but I know that 
options must have been available.  My '52 Standard has a drivers side sun 
visor which I haven't seen on many standard barndoors as well as rear corner 
body bumpers.
