Steve, list
      Color uniformity is rarely a problem.  Although there are soo many 
variables to that, more than just the guy who mixed the color too.  Sealer 
color, gun setup, humidity, air pressure, painter, number of coats, etc etc 
etc, you get the picture.  But, it is usually a VERY minor problem, and 
something I will gamble on to insure a nicer overall paint job.  Most the 
time, if you do see a color difference,  the color is soooooo close that only 
the painter can see it, and he or she is second guessing him or herself, and 
usually only under flourescent lights.  (they show all)  Metallics tend to be 
more of a problem with uniformity, but it is usually with the way the metalic 
&quot;lays&quot; than the color itself.
       As far as guns go, I only use Sata Jets.  They are the best, in my 
opinion, and spray sooo nice.  Most paint suppliers will let you rent one, or 
use one if you buy enough stuff.  Don't be afraid to ask..  I use the NR2000. 
 It would be worth the money if you had to pay to rent it, but get them to 
help you set it up..  Experience is needed here...  Most gravity feed guns 
spray well, but they do all spray a little different.  I just like the sata 
overall.
Good luck...
John
