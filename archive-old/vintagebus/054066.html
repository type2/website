Has anyone ever seen a Barn Door Westy Tow hitch For
sale?  I have the opertunity to buy one along with
some post BD hitch's but do not know what they go for.
I have no need for the BD one so i will be re-selling
it anyway.

For what it's worth, the '54 bus that I used to own included a very cool hitch.
At the risk of being wrong, I saw no reason why that hitch would not work on a
post 2/55 bus as long as it did not have a deep sump. Just make sure that any
hitch that you buy or fabricate is safe and rated for the weight to be towed.
