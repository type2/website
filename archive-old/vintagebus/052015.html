&gt;I own a 1963 23-window bus and a 1971 bus. Except for special occasions,=

I won't bother Vintagebus any more. There doesn't seem to be a forum for
later buses. That's  sad.
&gt;
Oh, c'mon, every Don Garies post is a special occasion in my book.

There is a forum for your '71 Bus, it's the &quot;Type 2 list&quot; at http://www.t=
