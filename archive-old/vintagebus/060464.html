Subject: Shameless Plug for Ronnie....Friday

Howdy y'all.....

Been lurkin' quite a bit lately....haven't hit the road since the Classic either....damn new toy has been keepin me pre-occupied =)

Anyways...just want to give a big thanks to Ronnie and oldvolks_dot_com for some recent help.  Ronnie has been there for me on dozens of occasions.  Whether buying parts, buses, or just needing advice.  Many thanks for all your help and all the good things you do for us bus folk.

OBC...

Finally...after several tries, several pullers and thousands of miles on a backed off axlenut....I have finally succeeded in breaking loose a rear drum frozen to the axle splines.

When you're doing those brakes...don't forget to grease them damn axle splines before putting that drum back on!  Now I just need to find time to complete this brake job .  Then drop the motor for a reseal and other maintenance.

Ronnie..you've got mail coming...

Later,
