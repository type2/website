&lt;&lt; A few simple questions.&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Sure, right!  Lol
 
&lt;&lt;1.  Did brakes and bearings on the 67.  Only grease I had on hand was white 
multi purpose.  Subsequently realized that there is drum brake grease for 
wheel bearings.  Will the white stuff be ok, or should I re-pack the the 
other stuff??&gt;&gt;
Get wheel bearing grease.  The white lithuim is way too thin.
 
&lt;&lt;2.  I have a T3 oil cooler that has a threaded boss on the backside of the 
cooler.  Can I plug the hole and use it in my upright T2 dog house fan 
shroud?&gt;&gt;
Think that it you would have to cut a hole in the shroud for the boss.  If so 
then no you can not used it.  Best to just upgrade to the type 4 cooler.
 
&lt;&lt;3.  How many muffler doughnut clamps should come in a typical installation 
kit?&gt;&gt;
If you mean bus then three.   Eric&amp;Barb
