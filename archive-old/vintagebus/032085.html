Hi Joel,
Not such a good idea.  The bushings are pressed in and this can cause the ID 
to shrink.  Plus the brake hone can not align the bushing bores like a reamer 
can.  Plus hones are really made for use on steel not nonferrus brass.
 
&lt;&lt;2) VW (via Bentley) says I should pull the whole front end and get to work 
using only VW special tool this that and the other one. I don't see a speck 
of dirt on those lab coats so I don't believe they pulled a greasy front beam 
at all. Just happened to have another one right here with all bushings 
changed... Kinda like a TV cooking show, huh?  Yeah, right.&gt;&gt;

You can do it in the bus, but you have to remove the forward shift linkage, 
build a fixture out of pipe, bolt, nut, and washers to pull out the old 
bushings and install the new ones to be reamed.
 
 &lt;&lt;3) Local bug shop says they have to do it for me and it will cost about 
$165. Something about the right sized reamer being hard to get hold of. They 
just jack up the front and work on the beam in place. &gt;&gt;

Get an adjustable reamer!  Just make sure to get it with a taper attachment 
so as to keep the reamer aligned.
Worse come to worse at least just replace the worn center pin.  The steel pin 
rusts and wears quicker than the soft, but tougher brass bushings.  This will 
take out about 70 - 80% of the slop in that area.
