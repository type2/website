They come in .040 and .060, these are the same thing used by dragracers, go
to the pits at a PRA event and between races you'll see these when they are
tearing down their engines. They are flat copper, the bummer is they only
have them 90.5 and bigger bores. Autocraft also makes them.

Hi Ronnie,
Do they come in different thickness?  Are they crushable or just flat
copper?
