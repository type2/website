You could use this compression test as the perfect excuse to do the
rebuild that you really want to do. That way you could put in a
counterweighted crank and full flow oil filter.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt;    Well I did a compression test today and things could be better. The
&gt; test reslts are as follows, Cylinders # 1,2 4 are fine all the same,
&gt; running about 120 each. But # 3 wants to be an individual, doesn't want
&gt; to be part of the team. That one is showing 30 lbs..So I know that ain't
&gt; a good thing.. So it looks like I must have a bad exhaust valve or it is
&gt; sitting funky.. Or I need to put in new rings all around.. Any other
&gt; suggestions?  This should be fun..
&gt; Thanks, Shawn
