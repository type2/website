I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966 production, 874th '67 
off the line).  My production plate reads:

05 7
430 C42 025 108
UT 2312 523907 7000874

The bus is essentially a 1 owner bus.  The original owner bought it 
through the tourist delivery program, it was not titled in the USA 
until very early in 1968 (I have the original title).  The original 
owner donated it to the Kidney Foundation, who sold it to a used car 
lot, who sold it to a friend of mine.  The friend soon realised it was 
beyond his abilities and sold it to me.

Other than the camping interior being gone it is fairly unmolested.  
There are some puzzles though...  The bus has a gas heater that 
appears to be an original installation, yet does not appear on the 
m-code line on the production plate.  Also, from the position of the 
drain hole in the floor of the bus, the camping interior was 
originally a SO-44 interior, not a SO-42 interior as the production 
plate indicates.  The fresh air vent plate is also stamped 23-42 as 
the model, which would indicate a SO-42 interior.

My guess is the original owners made changes to their order after the 
bus left VWAG and before the Westfalia interior was completed at 
Westfalia Werk.

What I would be interested in is production plate info and bus 
descriptions from other people with Dormobile camper tops and/or SO-44 
interiors, especially if they were part of the Tourist Delivery 
program.

If any of you have this info that you could share with me, I would be 
very appreciative.

Thanks,

Dave
