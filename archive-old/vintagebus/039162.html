Michael again,

I had seat belt bolts put into the pillar above the bulkhead at shoulder
height. They were done beautifully and look like they came from the
factory.

The bulkhead obstructs the line that the seat belt would need to follow
to run straight up to the mounting bolt from the inertia reel at the
doorside of each seat. I intend solving that problem by fabbing a sheet
metal 'sleeve' that the belt can run in for about 300mm. This will be
mounted on the pillar and will be bent in a lazy 's' so that belt will
run parallel to the bulkhead, enter the sleeve and be guided rearwards
to clear the bulkhead and be lined up with the seat belt hanger mount.
Does this explanation make any sense at all?

Later

Michael
