Subject: Must haves for road trip
Date: Sun, 06 Feb 2000 13:05:54 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I would consider myself a novice (but passionate) owner of a '67 bus, and am 
taking it from Kentucky to California in a little over a month, and just 
wanted to get some opinions on must haves for the trip as far as tool and 
spare parts go, as I am going to be placing an order to BusBoys soon. I have 
the idiots manual, and already have a clutch cable, accelerator cable, and 
v-belt on my list.
Any help would be greatly appreciated
Thanks
Ben Eilerman
