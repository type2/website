Subject: Re: [VB] Side step

I think you could buy them at the dealer and put them on any VW.   Helpful 
for getting into a bus.  Helpful for reaching a roof rack or the top of a 
load on a truck.

seen them a bunch on bays

&lt;&lt; I was going through my stash of stuff I got from the PO when I bought my 
'65
 DC and found a side step. Did side steps come standard on a DC? Also, is
 there any way to tell if it is original?
