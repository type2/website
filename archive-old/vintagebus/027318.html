Hi All - I just called the guy in St.Paul, He still has the camper, says
it's solid, was a restored bus and suffered a hit in the rear and a bit
in the front. says it could be repairable....

He wants around $2500 for the whole thing but will consider parting out
larger items if neccesary (would rather not, he's a VW guy,as well as a
small business owner...)

He also passed along his toll free number: 800-243-2448

Now, as they say, you know what I know....
