&lt;&lt; well...it isn't VW factory installed... but its a Dormobile pop top...and 
was probably
 a complete Dormobile at one time ...installed by the Martin Walter?? 
company?    Maybe &gt;&gt;


uhhhh......doesnt look like a dormobile to me.  Dor tops arent that high 
profile and dont reach all the way to the rear of the roof section.   Dor 
tops are also scuplured to the convexness of the roof......they're a bit 
rounded like the rood of the bus is.  It looks more like a bay window top 
without the front trim piece to match the height of the pop up part. It's 
also not quite as wide as the roof section and I think late model pop tops 
like that cover the whole roof so my guess is that it's aftermarket
