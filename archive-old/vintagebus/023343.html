Hi Jerry,
Could be so many things from tires, reduction bearings, reduction gears or 
transmission.  Are you sure it is anything to do with the tranny?  Try this, 
get it up to speed where it makes the most noise and then put it in nuetral 
and see if the noise keeps going.  If so then it dedfinitely is something in 
the tranny of RGBs.  If not then it could be something in the tranny that 
only acts up while pushing the VW forward or the engine or possibly due to a 
loose shift linkage part.   Eric&amp;Barb
