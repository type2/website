Subject: re gl-4 source
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id VAA29759

i finally found the gl-4 locally, saving me from having to mail order, the
problem I had was looking in the transmission oil section, instead of the gear
oil section. I just got a gallon of sta-lube gl-4 85-90wt.  going to try to
change out the oil, new boots, then finish up putting the final pieces on my
new engine.
