&gt;                    That's one thing I thought of doing.  recitculating the

&gt; You'll find the gas milage is better if you use the gas heater as auxilliary

???? Really??? haven't noticed any improvement

&gt; to the stock heat.   I did at least.   Any reason you can't put heater boxes
&gt; on the motor?

I don't have any of the stock heating system left,  have J tubes on engine
and the duct work long ago rusted to oblivion.  and the gas heater puts
out more than enough heat to keep the bus warm....in fact the only time I
have problems is when I'm trying to just take the chill off and need
almost no heat just a tiny little bit. the gas heaters don't work very
well at &quot;just a little heat&quot;
