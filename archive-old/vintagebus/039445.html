Hi all,
  My '59 panel van driver's door is beyond repair...Anyone on or near the 
East coast of the US have one they wouldn't mind parting with?  Heck anyone 
in the 48 contiguous states have one?
  I also need a deck lid and rear apron...Not as bad as the front driver 
door though.
TIA for any leads!
Mike
