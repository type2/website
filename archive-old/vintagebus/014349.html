Nice one!
On a sad note, the fellow who portrayed &quot;Q&quot; in the James Bond movies
has passed away.  He was involved in a head-on collision in the UK.

I adjust my valves so that a .006 in. feeler goes into the gap and a
.007 in. feeler doesn't.  I don't do enough adjustments to have real
good &quot;feel&quot;, so the go-nogo approach is more accurate for me.  I do
this every 2000 miles and usually only end up adjusting one or two
valves each time.
