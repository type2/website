&gt; List, and especially U.K. based listmembers:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to track down someone in the U.K.  His name is Steven Nolan, 
&gt; he supposedly owns, or owned, a VW restoration shop called Wolfsburg VW 
&gt; in Lancashire (?).

Robert,

You could try the following e-mail address for Steve Nolan:

wolfsburgvwtype2_at_aol_dot_com

I don't currently have a phone number for him with me - but if you 
don't have any luck with the above I'll dig out what I've got.

&gt; Anyway, Steven restored a Mango subhatch Westy that was featured in the 
&gt; Summer 2000 edition of VolksWorld magazine.  I needed to ask him a 
&gt; question regarding his restoration, specifically what he replaced the 
&gt; plastic bronze trim with that bands all of the tables and countertops.  
&gt; The stuff in his photos looked brand new, and since he refabricated all 
&gt; of the cabinets I can only assume that he refabbed this stuff too.

As far as I know, Dave (the cabinet maker) re-used the original trim, 
but I'm not certain - so best to confirm with Steve.

Hope that helps,

Steve
