Subject: Re: [VB] paint stripping?

I've had good luck with rubbing compound.  Start with the finest grade
(I think it is white) and go to a courser grade (red) if need be.  If
you feel you're good enough with a buffer, try that with the fine stuff.
 Be careful since it is really easy to burn through the original paint.
