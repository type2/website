That's right, and for all you AR types, he wasn't trying to buy the vintage
stuff. He inquired on the Westfailure, which was clearly out of his price
range, and we pointed out a couple of Lenny C. buses in front of us, which
he didn't go for, then he got all steamy over a slammed Deelucks around
back. Saw him across the street later looking over a set of BRM's, and
during the final raffle he test drove a very nice looking but not vintage
original doublecab. Looked like a guy trying to put a bus in the driveway,
not in the museum.

&gt; It wasn't *Eddie* who was stirring up the dust.  As far as I can tell, all
&gt; he wanted to do was buy a bus.  And because of his celebrity, some
&gt; self-righteous individuals thought that was wrong.  Don't ask me, I don't
&gt; get it.
