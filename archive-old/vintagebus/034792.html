Hi Jon,
Our 63SC with 3.875R&amp;P freeway flier and 205/75R15s on all four does 3,000 
RPM _at_ 58MPH according to the speedo.  When Barb follows in her Dad's 81 
Toyota she says it is doing about 60MPH.  The big bore forty HP engine is 
definitely under powered in fourth gear on the hills.  Unfortunitly due to 
todays heavier and higher traffic speeds running less than a 1500cc and 
higher gear tranny is the only ansewer for for many vast areas of the USA 
while getting a high MPG $ savings and far better engine longevity.  Eric&amp;Barb
