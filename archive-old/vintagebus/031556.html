Subject: Spot weld cutter Help.

Hi all,

Well I got back from Jerome and am all fired up to get back to work on
my bus.  Bought a new Miller 130 welder, and am re-inspired to finish up
this roof replacement.  I do however need a little advice on spotweld
cutters.  The ones I've been using so far are from Nothern Tool and
Equipment.  They seem to work pretty good , but I have around 50 to 100
more spot welds to go.  I know some of you have done alot of this, and
so I ask who makes a good strong one?  Anyone have any advice on this
subject.

Thanks,
Aaron

side tracked again
