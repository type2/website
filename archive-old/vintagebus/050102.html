Subject: Pandora Update or What is That Thing? I need advice.


The primo Pandora candidate is a 66 Deluxe, which is part of the 5-bus
stash found in upper Oklahoma by listee Josh Rodgers and civilian Chad
Cantwell, detailed earlier in these pages.

Chad owns the 66 and listee Rob Dahlgren helped me get first-in-line claim
to it, which was VERY cool of him because he has never met me or anything.
This was all based on Josh's on-line raving about the stash and its
quality, especially the 66. 8)

After some prodding and a little threatening by the sellers I drove out
there this weekend, in the 68 thank you very much, it was about 650 miles
out because I didn't know which way to take it and about 550 back because
Josh fixed me up with a CD that calculates these things. And it was sort of
hot too. My abused 68 ran flawlessy and kept trying to climb above 65, I
held it to 60 for its own good. That bus will not be stopped, it continues
to amaze me.

THE PANDORA BUS: is rustier and more hacked up than previously realized. I
don't think there was any deceit going on, I just think they didn't look
that close. Truly the bus is rusted in non-standard places. The cab floors
are okay, the cab door sills are still glossy (as advertised), the bottoms
of the doors are not bad at all. Aside from the rockers and one baseball
dent in the nose, the body is PERFECTLY straight. No dents, no dings, no
creases in the butt, no waves, all aluminum Deluxe trim present and
perfect, except for blending the rockers it needs NO Bondo. It looks good
from the outside.

It's not easy to crawl under beause it's sitting on spring plates, but once
you fit your head under there and then haul out the floor mat you find this:

Both inner and outer rockers are powdery mulch both sides held together by
paint. Cargo door sill hangs by threads. Front fenders are rusted through
but this looks confined and easily repaired. Cargo floors well receeded
along driver's side, behind both seats. You can see a lot of lawn through
this bus.

Serious bubbling on the inside of the windshield seals but not much on the
outside. The inside looks so bad I'm confident the windshields will need
cutting and welding.

Dash is good. I wanted a radio anyway, so there!

No long seats or prospect of any either. Interior will make you swear and
curse if you care about buses. Jailbars are gone in favor or furring strips
painted white and NAILED on to the window frames, the better to empasize
the homemade curtains which hang from nylon clothesline.

Far rear is bewildering. Some sort of hackneyed cabinetry with no storage
space held on with lag bolts. How nice.

You get to thinking, what? They were out of dynamite that day at ACE harware???

As previously mentioned, there is no driveline aft of the shift coupler.

Okay, this is where I need the advice with but I can't describe it so well:

Obviously somebody came and took the engine and trans at once. When they
took it, they used a torch. I don't know enough about splits to know
whether this is a crucial problem. The big U-shaped transmission support is
present, but aft of that there was --something-- else, held on with two
big-ass bolts which were not touched.

Outboard of that, toward the CVs, the thing has been sliced with a torch.
There is some sort of trans support that is gone but I don't have a splitty
on hand to slide under and look. Am I making sense? What matters is whether
the thing that was sliced can be bolted back on, or has to be measured and
welded, maybe getting it wrong (if Ken does it with Joe's welder). What is
the solid mount that is sternwise from the trans?
