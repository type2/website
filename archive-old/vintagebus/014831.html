Subject: RE: Fuel Smell Cont.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The smell does not seem care how much gas is in the
tank. I am always careful to only fill &lt;8 gallons at a
time and only do so on my way to work (25 mile drive).
 Just in case of overflow I have a new cap (thought
that was the problem), a new gasket on the filler tube
and my drain tube is squeaky clean.  Also, I have made
several attempts to find this right after stopping and
see no evidence of any fuel anywhere.  I park on
butcher paper and check for drips and poke around the
engine compartment.  Have not changed my fuel lines
from the tank to pump.  As mentioned, maybe there are
fine cracks that are soaking the cloth wrap enough to
smell, but not drip?  Sound reasonable?

Enjoy your day!
