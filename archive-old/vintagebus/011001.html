&lt;&lt; 4 track had two heads and you switched between them.  Great decks, even 
better that cassettes.  I've got two players from Crag and sever dozen tapes 
from the '60's.  I hope the crash didn't hurt, I had you on a high ped. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Thanks for the info!  Now to see if we can find one!  We were not hurt by the 
crash, landed on something soft.  Hope you were not too crushed!  ;-)
