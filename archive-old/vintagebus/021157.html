friend gave me a 1971 Super Beetle 1600 motor that I will be installing some
time this weekend. My question is regarding the clutch. The 1500 that came
out of the DC looks different from the 1600. Do I need to change the throw
out bearing or anything else on either the motor or the tranny side? Any
light that can be shed on this will be greatly appreciated!
Thanks...
