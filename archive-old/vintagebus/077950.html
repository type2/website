Subject: Wonder how this happened ?

Driving down the road and noticed my bus sounded louder than usual [not that
my bus EVER sounds loud, just heard the engine above my radio.]

When I got to work I noticed one of the two pea-shooters was gone ... Could it
be another bolt that the Mechanics From Hell forgot to tighten ??
