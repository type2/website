Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Hinge Replacement?

&gt; Anyone ever had to replace the Rear Cargo Door Hinges on a 67 Style Bus
and
&gt; if so how?  The part that bolts to the door and the part that this piece
&gt; bolts to are re bad on the Panel Bus.  It will no longer let the door
close
&gt; all the way and the hinge has to be &quot;pried&quot; down to close.  Can figure if
&gt; the pins have to be pressed out or weld a whole section in.

Aha!  Same question I have been asking. The U piece that bolts to the hatch
is held on on the other end by a long and a short square-headed pin and E
clip. The short piece is two pieces riveted together and is sorta part of
the torsion bars. The spring goes thru it and the end of the spring hooks
into it. In order to replace the short piece, you have to remove the 2
springs. The springs are held in brackets that are welded in the corners of
the roof. To remove from a donor bus, we bent the 4 ears on one bracket and
carefully walked the springs out.....they have a little tension on them!
With the tension off, the other end came out without bending the ears. With
the spring out, then you can slide the short piece off the hook end and then
walk it around the hook.

My 67 camper has a broken right side spring and destroyed right side short
piece and U piece. [both springs look identical]
I am looking for a way to replace the springs without cutting a hole in the
roof or bending the hooks. I think bending them and then bending them back
will weaken the tabs. There is a LOT of tension on that spot when the hatch
is down.
