Subject: Re: [VB] MC woes

Hi Pja,
Definitely install a 1972-79 bus MC and you absolutely have to install a 
pressure regulator for the rear brakes or they will lock up way before the fronts 
and you will end up doing sudden 180 spins when panic punching the brakes!!  
The vaccum servo is a good idea and is an easy hosing job.  The mounting of the 
vaccum servo will be harder.
