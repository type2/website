Subject: Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

All,

I soon expect my bus to be back from the bodyshop (after two and a half 
years -- long story, so let's forget that for the moment).  She has been 
completely reworked inside and out (blasted down and built back up again), 
and will have new paint in every nook and cranny.  Before I begin putting in 
the sound proofing (Dynamat Extreme), insulation (Mylar-faced fiber-tech 
padding) and vapor barrier (7 mil insulating plastic), I would like to put 
something over the new paint to get an extra bit of assurance against rust 
via moisture buildup.  (Maybe this is something I do not need, but I am 
always looking for that little extra edge -- and maybe in this case I am 
pushing a bit too hard to find it).  I was thinking of using something like 
one of the following rubberized coatings over the paint to get that edge:

What (if anything) does anyone have to say about this?  Am I setting myself 
up for more problems by doing this, or am I simply engaging in overkill?
