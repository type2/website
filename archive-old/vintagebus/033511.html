&gt;Being we have been on the subject of fuel, how about what Grade of gas do
&gt;you use and what is your TRUE (a lot of dreamers out there) gas mileage.

3000 miles on my engine with a notebook keeping track of fill ups and 
miles. I've adjusted for inaccuracies in my speedo and odometer (due to 
tire size I assume) and came up with 20 miles to the gallon easy. It 
actually was 22 miles to the gallon, but I always lean a little to the 
worse to make sure. So I'm happy.

It's a stock 1600cc DP engine that I overhauled myself (my first and only 
one so far). I use regular unleaded fuel. I drive 50 miles a day, with 40 
of them being HWY miles.
