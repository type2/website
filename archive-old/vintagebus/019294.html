Subject: re:roof rack painting

someone asked about repainting the roofrack...my full length rack was
originally galvanized(or it looked that way to me)

I had it re galvanized...was told it should last about 40 years...at the time
I had it galvanized, i got a quote for powder coating I think it was around
$60. That includes blasting.

The galvanizing was free, the guy was sympathetic to a student with a vw.
