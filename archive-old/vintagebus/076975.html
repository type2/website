Subject: Re: [VB] Stalling on sharp throttle relase, but idles fine
  [long]

Hi Matt,
Whoops!  Got rushed sending out last email.  It could be either or both you 
pilot (Idle) or main jets are too big.  Also could be you fuel pump is putting 
out too much pressure due to too high or long of push rod, or the fuel shut 
off or the float in the carb is bad.  So check fuel pressure, and possibly 
replace the fuel shut off valve and float.
  We once had a float that had no cracks or fuel in it, but was just too 
heavy.  When that was replaced the dripping out of the throttle shafts went away.
