How about this week's Friday topic being: DEFINING THE
LIST ACRONYMS.

I've been on the list about 3 months and I'm just
getting up to speed..so how about everyone defining
some of the acronyms for everyone else, so we're all
speaking the same language....Unless there's a
glossary somewhere?

PO (previous owner)
IMHO (in my humble opinion)
FWIW (for what it's worth)

etc.

What's a DPO damn, dumb? PO
and FLAPS I think it has something to do with auto
parts store.

I'm sure there's some new ones out there too.
Sure beats griping about eb*y..
