Hi all,

I would like to get a bug from Oklahoma to Oregon.  It needs to be cheap
though... the car is only worth ~500 but has some 'history' behind it that
would be worth preserving.

(http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/dragengine.htm)

Any help would be appreciated and there is really no hurry... just some time
in the next 'n' months.


TIA

David Mayes
