Subject: Re: [VB] poor gas mileage

Okay, first, thanks to everyone for your responses.
I checked the main jet and it seems to be stamped 129.
The air correction jet is illegible.
Not quite sure about an emulsion tube, as nothing in my diagram was labeled
as such.
I am wiring in a tach this evening and will test the cruising rpm theory
tomorrow. 

Thanks again


&gt; Check your cruising RPM!  We used to drive at 3,800 RPM at 55 MPH and
thought 
&gt; we could hear that we were doing only 3,000 RPM, as we can without any 
&gt; problem in the bugs, and KGs.  When we found out what RPM we were doing
when we 
&gt; temporarly installed a tach we slowed down to 3,000 RPM at 47 MPH our MPG
went 
&gt; from 18-19 to 27 
&gt;   Also we would check the carb jetting.
