Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

Don,
Are we talking about the bolt or the threaded insert in the case?

If it's the bolt, you should be able to get it in there....I've done it a few 
times. It's tight...be should be doable.

If we're talking about the insert....and you work alone..best to wait until 
you drop that motor again.  Putting that insert in is a bitch esp. if it's a 
doghouse shroud.  I know a few guys that say it can be done, but I've never 
been successful.

&gt; , I forgot to start the engine

&gt; stepping on the clutch would move the arm enough to get it in there.  
&gt; It won't.  Is there a trick to getting that engine bolt through without 
&gt; pulling the motor?
