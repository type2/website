FWIW, I'll often do this.  I currently have three vehicles: my '60
bus, a 250cc bike, and a 800cc bike.  The first two can usually do up
to 55MPH, although that's a challenge some days (apparently
atmospherical conditions have an effect; I'm at roughly 5200 feet).
The latter really wants to cruise at 60MPH or 80MPH, depending on
which gear I'm in.

My driving style has been labelled as &quot;conservative&quot;.  I have enough
trouble keeping an eye out for active road hazards that I don't want
to waste energy on also looking for speed traps.  So, I prefer to
drive at the speed limit, so I'm legal all the time.  Not that that
prevents me from getting pulled over, but they have to come up with a
better excuse than breaking a trivial law....  My theory is that the
fewer times they interact with me, the less of a record they'll have,
so if I ever *do* need to get away with something, I'll be less of a
suspect ;-)

The problems become:

- speed limit 55MPH, everyone wants to go faster; being behind someone
  going roughly the speed limit helps me not feel guilty doing the
  same, and keep legal all at the same time.  This is particularly
  useful on the larger bike.  It also allows diverting attention from
  the speedometer to looking for road hazards.

- speed limit greater than 55MPH; being behind something big going
  less than the speed limit is good because people are more likely to
  see a slow lumbering semi than my little bus

Is this everyone's motivation?  Almost certainly not.  But it's one of
the reasons why people might follow a bus.

WRT the emphasis on road hazards, I've had people actively try to kill
me while on the bikes (like, make eye contact, wave, and then pull out
in front of me).  That sort of anti-socialness seems worth watching
out for....
