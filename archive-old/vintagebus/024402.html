Subject: Re:Re: Oil Cooler Upgrades II

Hi, Eric &amp; Barb,
I have a doghouse fan that measures 34mm actual blade, not counting the
plates that hold the blades together. Does that make it a 35mm fan?  I
don't see any 2:1 pulleys for sale in my catalogs, I guess they were
stock on the doghouse motors. Hopefully a junkyard item or next summers
swapmeets at a show. We live north of Los Angeles, CA so we're looking
forward to Long Beach or Solvang. We recently picked up our '67 from a
guy in Hermosa Beach, &quot;Blues Clues&quot; blue with a white roof. It appears
all original, except paint color, but needs lots of TLC. There is a
&quot;clunk&quot; in the steering when first starting to turn the wheel, probably
a tie rod end, but haven't located the source, yet. New plugs, wires,
cap, rotor, 009, Pertronix, oil and a paper air filter made it run nice
and smooth considering it has 196,000 and the motor was rebuilt at
88,000. No. 3 is toasted, because it oil fouls after a few hundred
miles.
