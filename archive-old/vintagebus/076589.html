Subject: front seat area?

All this talk about flipseats and stuff has me wondering.

I've always heard that cutting out the benchseat metal weakens the bus
because it is a key structural point. Even though walkthroughs are floor
level in the center, they are somehow built to do what they need to do. This
has never made any sense to me, because I see buses all the time with the
bench seat area cut out, and I see no buckling in the body or anything like
that. They seem to be just fine, except the part where they have Fiero seats
mounted in there. (haha).

Is this an old wives tail that has spread to every corner, or is there some
actual evidence that shows that cutting out the bench seat actually does
weaken the bus? I personally don't see how it affects anything since the bus
has a roof and a floor to keep it's shape, and you don't see any bulkheads
through the rest of the bus to help keep it's shape. Unless you count the
metal that seperates the engine bay from the interior.

Not that i'm thinking of cutting my benchseat out or anything, but I'm just
wondering if there is any facts to back this up thing that I continually
hear. My curios mind wants to know.

Thanks.
