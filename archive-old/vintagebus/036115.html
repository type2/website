 Hey All,
 I'm new to this list, but I've been on the T2 list for some time.  I just 
bought a 66 standard with no interior.  I have a line on a camping interior 
from a 73 westy.  Will there be anything on the 73 bus that I can use for the 
66??  I am most interested in seats and a cabinet or two.  Please advise.  
I'm looking forward to getting &quot;to know&quot; you all on this list!

the westy kit will fit, but you will have to shorten the long cabinet by the 
bed, as a bay is longer there than a split.  The cushion in the very back is 
also a bit long.  Also, you will find the heat log and the bed have issues 
over using the same space- take the door off under the z bed and cut a hole 
in the wood in the bottom of it.

I have a bay bus Z bed in my 61 deluxe, thats what I did to fit it.
