Well I got a solicitation in my email and couple of weeks ago for &quot;free&quot;
business cards at www.vistaprint_dot_com - it ended up costing me around $14.00
because of all the neat online features you can do to customize the card.  I
ended up with a box of 250 of this card:

I know the actual business is really &quot;fake&quot; but it's a name I dreamed up a
couple of years ago.  I decided to have fun with it and turn it into a
business card.  This way others will have a way to remember me.

I didn't get my email address on the card but a trip to my website will give
a person the link to email me.  The various websites are some of my
favourites so I added on Thom's site, the Type 2 site, and Paul Ledbetter's
site.

Enjoy...
