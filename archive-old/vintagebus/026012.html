Subject: clutch recomendations

my Local FLAPS has two clutch brands available.  Valejo and Sachs. 
One is Brazilian and one is Mexican.  Valejo is the cheapest of the
two.  He recomends Sachs saying it is made better but also said the
Valejos is a brand also used in the Ford F-150 trucks.  He then said
there are no German clutch discs available, not even in Europe.  I'm
sure there are more than those two brands.  What brand clutch disc
would anyone recomend I use?  I would want something that would last
the longest.  I'll just be getting the usual stock 300 mm. or is it
200mm.?  I would also like a brand recomendation for a pressure plate,
throw out bearing, fork, O ring, mail seal, spring, and all other
parts for this clutch job.
TIA
Matt Adams
