Subject: Questions for dizzy gurus

Hello Brothers and Sisters!

While digging around the shop at work today for a dizzy for a 79 rabbit,
I came upon a couple of old skool Bosch dizzies. They are both locked
up, but I'm pretty sure I can fix that.

0 231 129 019... This is a mechanical advance dizzy with 2 piece points.

ZV/JCU 4 R 3... This is a vacuum advance dizzy. The screw that attaches
the arm from the diaphragm to the plate is missing, but I can find
another. The diaphragm is airtight, and has a protrusion with what looks
like an adjustment screw with a bolt over it.

I really like the look of the old skool dizzies, and I'd like to use one
on my newly rebuilt 1776. I have a pertronix ignitor which I intend to
use instead of points.

Here are my questions:

1) Is there any reason that either of these dizzies wouldn't work on an
AH case?

2) Has anyone ever installed electronic ignition in one of these old
skool dizzies?

3) I believe the advance curve can be adjusted on both of these dizzies.
What seems to work best with a bus, a fast curve or a slow one?

4) Bosch numbers for cap and rotor.

Get your books out! This oughtta keep you dizzy gurus out of trouble for
a little while...

david
