&gt;Hi Al,
&gt;Try calling Butch at Bear's VW machine (619) 691-8385.  A 1641cc SP with 
&gt;new
&gt;unleaded heads, counter wieght 69mm crank, and new engine case is $1,300.00
&gt;with core trade in, $1,400.00 without trade in and shippingfrom SanDiego to
&gt;Seattle is $125.00.  We have over 50,000 miles on the same type of engine 
&gt;we
&gt;got from them and it is still strong, smooth and quiet.  Please do tell him
&gt;that Eric&amp;Barb said &quot;H!&quot;.   Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;

Wonder how much a 1680 is? I like that setup but rarely see it. You get the 
reliability of a 1600 with thicker p/c then a 1641. Anyone doing that???
Jason
