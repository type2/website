Subject: Re: US 9 wire TSS brake lights sticking on problem ?

&gt;I have a 1965 Deluxe which has the 9 wire US model Turn Signal Switch
&gt;running flashers as well as turn/brake lights.

Interesting.  I thought the US models didn't get this until 1966.

&gt;It worked fine till the weekend when I realised the brake lights come on
&gt;the first time you brake - and then stay on till the engine is shut off.
&gt;I checked the switch on the master cylinder, and pulling the wires makes
&gt;no difference, so I assume this must be the relay in the TSS sticking.

There isn't a relay in the switch itself, and I don't think a failure in
the switch can cause the effects you describe.  You _probably_ have the
9-prong box flasher relay.  The odd thing is that the likely failures of
the 9-prong box would result in either no brake lights at all or the brake
lights flashing, instead of &quot;latching&quot; on like yours are, but I guess
anything is possible.  Another possibility is that the previous owner may
have used the electrical system of your Bus as a vehicle for creative
expression.

I would suggest that you locate the 9-prong box in front of the front
trim panels and unplug the 54f and 54 wires from it.  Connect them
together and try the brakes.  If the brake lights work correctly, then
the problem is in the 9-prong box.  If the turn signals still flash,
then you can leave the 54f and 54 wires connected together and run
the Bus that way.  The only problem will be that if you have the hazard
flashers on and the turn signal not in the center-off position, one of
the rear lights will not flash.

If connecting 54f and 54 doesn't fix the brake lights, or if you don't
have a 9-prong box, then a previous owner may have done creative things
with the electrical system.

This should be the wiring diagram for your Bus:

I wrote an article about the 9-prong box, which contains troubleshooting
information for the whole turn signal and hazard flasher system:
