A vague question for you.  My youngest son wandered in today after being MIA 
for two days snow boarding in the hills and asked if I was interested in a 
single cab.  Right out of the blue.  I have seen it from the street: 
relatively straight with no obvious cancer, no apparent hits to the nose, 
has all the gates in what appears to be good to very good condition, doors 
and windows.  Fried egg lights I think they are called.  Oh yeah.. it 
changes position and since they live on a rather steep hill in the 
development it has gotta run a little.  Has some sort of rack that you would 
see on a pick up truck for carrying lumber but it is attached to the bed as 
best I can tell and not to the gates.

So... given your time and experience on the list and with buses in general 
(sorry for the obvious kissing up) what might be considered a reasonable 
price on something like this (if there is such a thing nowadays)?  My son 
said he was selling it cheap but would have to get back to me on how much so 
I really have no idea what's up here other than my wife will hang my exposed 
backside outdoors if I pursue this. (Actually she is very indulgent of this 
poor souls interests).  A crew its not... but a bus it is.

Thanks Thom.. later.
