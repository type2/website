Hi,

I have looked at many many headlight assemblies at the
swaps. I have yet to see one for the driver side with a
drain hole at the bottom. Also, what is the deal with the
inner ring that keys in with the lamp glass notches?  I have
yet to figure out how to find a left and a right. If you
have two rights or two lefts, one of the lights goes in
upside down. How do you figure out what ring is what?

Chris

&gt;
&gt; You have one bug, and one bus headlight.  The best deals
are _at_ the swaps;
&gt; headlights generally gofor ~$10 each, complete.  I've seen
'em for more,
&gt; bought 'em for less.  Euro headlights are way more, as
high as $400 for
&gt; used, to $150 for NOS, at least on ebay.
&gt;
&gt; Try to get a matched set of the same brand, hella or
bosch.  There's a
&gt; a small drain hole that should be at the bottom.  Some
have it, some
&gt; don't, but that's the easiest way to tell left from right.
I've been
&gt; seeing an awful lot of &quot;pairs&quot; of NOS light which are
actually two
&gt; of the same side.  The vendors even display them as if
they're a
&gt; set, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see they're
mismatched.
&gt; This is even more important with euro lights, which have
special
&gt; lensing which can't be inverted.
