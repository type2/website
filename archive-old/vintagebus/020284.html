That's what it took last time, by the time we picked everyone up in every
podunk town going thru the SJ valley.  

&gt; from sacramento, plus driving to la (la-la land) from here (monterey). you

The 911 water pump is NLA -gotta find an NOS one on ebay...

&gt; leaving friday, going to rich's, going to octo, then maybe the classic and
&gt; then coming back sunday afternoon so rachel can go to work in palo alto
&gt; monday (at 4 in the morning).  why not fly?  there is nothing with saying

&gt; clasic this year, but still going to octo.

I did consider skipping the classic if I did go.  There didn't seem to be anything
