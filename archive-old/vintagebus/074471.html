 Hey Guys,
 Regarding the retorquing of heads, I am concerned that the head studs are
 pulling out of their threads in the case. I read recently on the list that
 there are case saver studs. How do these work? Do you need to put them in
 when the case is open? Is there a way to install them with engine together?

wondering what style case you have.   I have only had this problem with the 
earlier alloys, the B, H, and earlier cases, not with the later alloy or A 
cases. (AE, AK etc)   Odds are that your engine has been abused in the past, and 
the metal integrity compromised.   

You can get studs that are self threading on one end, that go into the case.  
they are kinda pointy with large non machine threads.  these you can double 
nut the outer end and thread them in.   Which probably means taking the head 
off.  To insert the case savers, you do need to tear the engine down to short 
block, but that risks getting shavings in it, so really ought to take it to a 
bare case.   Then you might find the case doesn't go back together right, as is 
warped and binds.  (BTDT)

 I recommend using the bandaid type studs, and finding a replacement case of 
the later alloy, preferably on with case savers and small diameter studs.  I 
thinks regular are 8mm, the small are 6mm, but may have the numbers off.  Early 
cases are fine if they havent been abused. I drove around on an H case for 
years and it was great, studs didn't pull out when I finally did a top end 
rebuild, but If I'm building a motor up I get the later alloy.  Just cause you 
never know.  Plus only the B early alloy cases are dual relief / larger oil 
passage.   So I'd bandaid it and put some pennies by for building up a new motor.
