Volks,

It was I that Doctor Tim was referring to in his post earlier this week on
rebuilding distributors, and I want to thank him for the info.  In
addition, I received a response from Scott Fraser that forwarded info and
mail he had gotten from Bob Hoover.  This initiated discussions with Bob
and I have attached the result below, in case anyone else decides this is
worth a shot.  My sincere thanks to all who sent responses!

Bob also drew a sketch of the jig he made for holding the dist while the
pin is being driven out.  This sketch can be seen at:

 =======================distributor.txt====================
 
 This is a composite post of advice from Bob Hoover on rebuilding a
 distributor.  Much of it comes from mail that Bob sent to Scott Fraser
 when Scott was rebuilding his, some from mail Bob sent to me when I asked
 him about what he had written to Scott.  These words are by and large
 Bob's, not mine (I have labeled the various sources)... If you want to
 ask further questions, or reuse them, talk to Bob, not me!  I have cut and
 pasted the various sections of Bob's mail into an order that made sense to
 me, which may not be the best for you.  If you want the originals, I will
 be happy to forward them.  As I work my way thru the rebuild, I will take
 pictures and eventually I hope to post them to my web site (but you *know*
 how good I am at that :-)
 
 Applicability:
 
 Steve: These discussions relate to the composite distributors used in
 later T4 engines ('72-&gt;)  The discussions may relate to earlier
 distributors, but no guarantees there.
 
 Scott: ...this distributor has both vacuum advance and centrifugal
 advance, from what I understand, that would make it a desirable
 distributor to fix up and use. ??
 
 Bob: Composite distributors are the norm in the real world.  VW came to
 them rather late in life, only when forced to do so by the new emission
 laws.
 
 The advantage of a composite distributor is that it provides the
 sensitivity of a vacuum type with the wide dynamic range of a centrifugal
 type.  The vacuum advance mechanism senses the change in pressure across
 the venturi which accompanies any change in load on the engine and uses
 that small signal to initiate (or retard) the advance.  Once advance has
 been initiated, the engine's rpm will begin to change.  Now the
 centrifugal mechanism comes into play, sensing the change in the engine's
 speed and taking over the chore of advancing the firing point.
 
 Unfortunately, when it comes to emissions, a centrifugal-advance distributor 
is a bad idea.  When you take your foot off the throttle the mixture -- the 
fuel/air ratio -- immediately goes RICH, not because the engine is getting 
lots of fuel but because it isn't getting very much air.  But the 
centrifugal-advance mechanism is still spinning at engine-speed which is 
still high, meaning the spark is still ADVANCED.  Indeed, the ignition is 
advanced so far, the rich mix doesn't ignite properly and you blow most of 
that partially combusted rich mix out the tail pipe.   (Can you spell s-m-o-g 
? :-) 

In composite distributors fitted with the dual canister arrangement, manifold 
pressure, which rises as the rpm's fall, is used to quickly retard the firing 
point, insuring better combustion of the rich mix.  Unless you're a dedicated 
tree-hugger you need not connect the retard-side of the dual canister but it 
should be connected if all of your driving is of the stop &amp; go variety in a 
metropolitan environment.  We all gotta breath.  (Plus, your engine will last 
longer.  A rich mix makes a good solvent.)
 
 Rebuildability:
 
 Scott:  Am I in rebuilding territory here?
 
 Bob: Unless the bushings in the body of the distributor are worn beyond
 spec (try rocking the shaft in the bore), I consider ANY distributor to be
 rebuildable.
 
 Initial Measurement:
 
 Scott: I set the distributor up in the vice and put a dial indicator on
 the top of the shaft, adjusted and zeroed the meter.  Holding the drive
 gear (dog gear?), I pulled on the shaft and found I had 0.024&quot; of
 movement. Releasing the drive gear, I pulled on the shaft and the total
 movement was 0.064&quot;
 
 Bob: On this type of distributor you're actually seeing two different
 types of 'end-play.'  The distributor shaft is not a single piece of metal,
 end-to-end, the centrifugal mechanism uses a second shaft concentric
 upon the mainshaft.
 
 It is the mainshaft -- the thing to which the dog-gear is attached -- that
 you should concern yourself with.  You should be able to measure the
 end-play of the mainshaft by clocking it at the dog-gear.
 
 If the .024&quot; dimension is valid, it is excessive. 
 
 The rotor-head part -- the centrifugal mechanism that fits down over the 
mainshaft -- has nothing to do with the sealing of the shaft nor the 
'hunting' that can result from excessive end-play in the mainshaft.  
'Hunting' is when the firing point moves back &amp; forth when viewed with a 
stroboscopic timing light. This is an artifact of excessive end-play combined 
with wear in the gears that drive the distributor.  Should you care to work 
out how serious this problem can become, it involves the vector prescribed by 
the shaft when it is driven partly up&amp;down rather than round&amp;round.  

Some 'hunting' is always present at low engine speed due to inertial effects 
and the normal end-play clearance.  But it's the sort of thing you need to 
keep an eye on because once the end-play wears beyond a certain limit, the 
rate of wear, especially on the end-play shims and the two oil seals, 
accelerates dramatically.  I've seen plenty of distributors that had no shims 
of any kind, save a few sickle-like fragments.
 
 Excessive end-play also causes problems on the other end of the distributor 
shaft, up inside the distributor cap.  Besides the jittery nature of the 
timing when viewed with a stroboscopic timing light, keep your ear tuned for 
remarks about excessive
distributor-cap wear or unusual noises from the distributor cap.  When 
end-play becomes excessive, the pumping action wears out the central graphite 
button.  Once the button wears excessively, it comes free of the housing, 
leaving only the little spring to make contact with the rotor (and produce a 
characteristic sound).
  
 Replacement parts:
 
 Bob: The Bosch kit for overhauling distributors had about 100 of these 
oil-seal
 washers (1/2&quot; ID, about 7/8&quot; OD, by about .030&quot; thick).  By comparison,
 the kit had only about two dozen metal end-play shims.  The end-play shims 
look exactly like the phenolic washers except they are metal and came in 
several
 thickness'. The kit also included an assortment of return springs and
 hardware, the screws used to hold the points to advance-plate, the adjusting 
screw (ie, the one with the big head) and the grounding lead to the body of 
the distributor.  When the distributor was overhauled, typically after 50,000 
to 70,000 miles of service, the standard practice was to replace the 
adjusting screw and other fasteners
 
 I've a hunch the kit is still available from Robert Bosch &amp; Co -- their
 distributors were used on many other vehicles besides Volkswagens -- but
 VW dealers were the only people I know who carried the kit.  Volvo did
 not, for example, although they used Bosch distributors.
 
 One of the most useful pieces of information you might offer the folks is
 where you found the rebuild-kit.  A couple of times I've gone so far as to
 buy a new -009, tore it down just for the shims &amp; stuff.  Locally, (San
 Diego county) VW dealers are no help when it comes to air-cooled parts.
 
 Steve:  I bought my rebuild kits from Olympic.  Alas, I don't think they
 are the same as they used to be.  They *do* contain two phenolic washers,
 in two different ID's and a number of metal shims, as well as some clips
 and felt pads. I am hoping this will be enough to do what I want.  Any
 Bosch agent *should* be able to get this, but if they can't won't, Olympic
 does do mail-order.  Contact info for Olympic is:

 Bus Depot and Bus Boys should also be good sources... call and see.
 
 Disassembly:
 
 Scott: ...in removing that pin that holds the drive gear in place, are
 there any tricks, things not to do. a few initial taps with a hammer and
 soft pin, did not budge it.
 
 Bob: This is fairly common.  The pin may be rusted to the gear... or to the
 shaft.  Or there may be a buildup of varnish.  Soak the end of the shaft
 in carb cleaner overnight (and JUST THE END -- carb cleaner will eat the
 phenolic washers), get it smoking hot with a torch, support it in a
 fixture of some kind and HIT IT HARDER :-)
 
 To rebuild the distributor you must dismantle it and to do that you must be
 able to hold it.  For most of us, holding the thing without damaging the 
aluminum body is the key to success and the answer is to make yourself a 
holding fixture. On the fixtures I've made the dog-gear is supported by a 
hardwood (maple) pallet machined to a matching curve (hint: Find a spade-bit 
that is a close match to the dog-gear diameter.  Drill a hole in a piece of 
hardwood then cut it in two).  To provide a 'drop-space' for the pin when it 
is driven out, drill a radial hole in the pallet.
 
 My fixtures were a bit more elaborate at first -- machined aluminum.
 Later, I used wood, matching the diameter of the distributor by using the 
lathe.  Later still, I'd just hog out a chunky sorta notch with a jig saw, 
wrap some Saran-Wrap around the distributor, slather metal-filled epoxy putty 
on the wood and mash the thing down, come back when it was hard.  They've got 
epoxies nowadays that are suitable for repairing GEARS, really super-tough 
stuff (expensive, too).  But for simple jigs, tools, molds &amp; fixtures, cheap 
stuff such as Bondo will do the job.

The holding fixture can be pretty simple with regard to the 'holding' part -- 
anything that supports the distributor without damaging it will usually work. 
 But you must pay attention to the load-path.  Small part needing a heavy 
whack, you gotta provide a suitable load path, otherwise you'll just break 
your fixture or damage the part.  That's where the maple comes in.  With the 
dog-gear supported on the maple 'anvil' you can give the thing a hellova 
whack without damaging anything.  And sometimes that pin simply won't move 
unless you hit it hard.

 The other end of the fixture (ie, supporting the big-end of the distributor) 
can be a hunka pine... or whatever.  It's only there to hold the distributor 
in alignment whilst the whackin's going on :-)
 
 After removing the dog-gear, before removing the shaft debur the area around 
the pinhole using #600 wet &amp; dry paper.  If there is a burr or lip, or if 
there is a thick buildup of varnish, you can bugger-up the bearings, the two 
sleeves in the 'neck' of the distributor.  

Once you get it apart,  inspect the shims, especially the phenolic shims used 
as oil seals.  There are two shim-stacks, each made up of two (or three) 
steel shims and one phenolic washer.  The lower stack goes between the 
dog-gear and the body of the distributor.  The upper stack is on the other 
end of the distributor's mainshaft, up inside the body of the distributor.  
The oil seals always go against the body of the distributor.  Their purpose 
is to keep the lubrication in the neck of the distributor, where it oils the 
sleeve-type bearings... and to keep the oil OUT of the big end of the 
distributor, where it would quickly foul the points.  (Sound familiar? :-) 

In most cases the excessive end-play you measure or the hunting you observe 
with the timing light is because the phenolic washers have worn out.  The fix 
is to to simply dismantle the distributor and replace them.  If you catch it 
early enough, the metal shims will still be okay.

The use of a phenolic washer as an oil seal causes a lot of raised eyebrows 
but its use is appropriate in this application.  In theory, when you have a 
stack-up of shims, rotation is distributed across the stack, meaning the one 
closest to the rotating FLANGE (not the shaft itself) will spin at about the 
same speed as the flange but the next shim will rotate at a slower rate, the 
next one still slower and so on.  Since the distributor rotates at only half 
the speed of the engine, and since that rotation is distributed across the 
shim-stack, the phenolic washers don't see a lot of motion and will last a 
thousand hours or more.  
 
Dog-gears, or the slot &amp; tang arrangement, are used when you need to
 transfer power but the driver and driven parts may not be perfectly
 aligned.  VW uses this arrangement on their distributor and oil pump.
 
 For a dog-gear to work properly the dog, the tang-part of the
 pair, must be free to move if the tang is a tight fit in the slot.
 That's where the pin comes in. It allows the dog to slide back and forth
 slightly, as necessary to allow the two parts to rotate even though they
 may not be in precise alignment (generally a good assumption when one of
 the parts is designed to be removed &amp; replaced periodically).  That means
 the pin will be fairly tight in EITHER the shaft or the dog... but not
 both.
 
 Setting Distributor End Play:
 
 Bob: A new -009 can also give you some idea of the amount of end-play you
 should have in the mainshaft.  I forget what it was... six-thou or
 thereabouts... but it could have been tighter.
 
 I'm pretty sure the overhaul specs for both centrifugal and vacuum-advance
 distributors were covered in the real Volkswagen Workshop Manual for early
 buses.  At least, they were in my long-vanished copy. (THICK manual. Black
 leatherette covers with silver lettering.)  That was before
 composite-types came on the scene but the end-play and so forth should be
 the same for the mainshaft.
 
 Steve:  Alas, no one seems to have these books.  Dave Easterwood found a
 reference to them as being in the Shop Manual, Section K.  If anyone has
 these manuals, PLEASE write me!!!
 
 Bob: The initial wear on any shim-stack is rather great.  Once the shims
 have broken in, the wear-rate flattens out.  Knowing the thing is going to
 loosen up a bit, try to hold to the minimum spec during assembly.  But get
 things too tight and the shims won't be able to lubricate themselves, are
 liable to gall and tear each other up within the first thousand miles.
 Those initial high pressures and high temperatures (associated with
 wearing-in) are why I used moly grease instead of something else.  (This
 rule for shim-stacks also applies to crankshaft end-play.)
 
 Lubrication:
 
 Bob: I use moly based CV-joint grease on the shims during assembly but not
 much of it.  Ditto for the friction points on the centrifugal mechanism
 (were talking composite carbs here).  Use a toothpick or wire as your
 applicator (for the centrifugal mechanism... your finger does fine for the
 shims).  The body of the distributor 'sees' crankcase temperatures making
 the moly a better choice than common chassis lube.  Bosch recommends their
 own lubricants of course, one type for the shims, another for the cam (if
 you're still running points) and if you can find it, use it.  But here
 again the problem is procurement, hence my use of moly on the shims and
 Lubriplate on the cam.
  
 Notice all the friction points in the centrifugal-advance mechanism.  Plan on
 dismantling the thing, replacing the phenolic washers and lubing the 
friction points.  Plan to do it at least every 70,000 miles.  The wiser 
course is to provide yourself with a spare distributor, to make yourself a 
fixture then give the thing an overhaul.  When you see your installed 
distributor starting to 'hunt,' pull that puppy outta there and plug in the 
spare.  Now you can overhaul the original distributor, wrap it up and stow it 
under the seat as your spare.
