Isaiah,
I thought I would mention that yes, your headlight buckets were worn through
from someone's feet.  This is a normal occurence for like 99% of the split
Buses I have seen.

It's funny, most Barndoors have the little foot rest on the passenger side
but people still put their foot on the headlight bucket.
