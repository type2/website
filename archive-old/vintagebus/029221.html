&gt; Well today I got the motor out of my bus to change the front oil seal
&gt; and something is strange. There wasn't oil all over the clutch or
&gt; pressure plate. Shouldn't there have been?

Maybe your case has a crack in it behind the flywheel??  Kinda hard to tell
with the motor out...as it will seep out of the crack (if there is one) when
the motor is warm or hot.  maybe tap on the case edge a little bit after
wiping the area behind the flywheel down and see if anything comes out?
