1) Do a compression test.   Make sure it isn't a bad plug wire or distributor 
cap.

2) check the end play... turn the engine to TDC and push/pull the crank 
pulley.   The play should be about .003&quot; to .006&quot;, with a wear limit of about 
.010&quot;... a thick hair.  It is goes clunk clunk the bottom end bearings are worn.

3) sometimes the 40hp cases are actualy previously bored out to big bore 
40hp, which is a 1500.

4) with the bottom end in good shape, I have rebuildt the top end (new rod 
bearings. rings, rebuildt heads) and put many miles on.  However, this was with 
a good bottom end, not w/ worn out main bearings.

5) read your Muir Idiot book chapter on rebuilding an engine.   It has some 
stuff in there about checking wear, too

&gt; On my 63 Panel with what I think is a stock 40hp single port engine, I 
&gt; wanted to do a ring job due to plug on cylinder #4 getting extremely wet with oil 
&gt; thus fouling the plug and running on three cylinders. Now I know there could 
&gt; be other issues but I thought I'd start there, anyway, my question is a 2 
&gt; parter; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1st: Can I upgrade the size of the cylinders without splitting the case and 
&gt; leaving all rotating components stock?
&gt; 
&gt; 2nd: Does anybody have suggestions on a vendor and or specific product?
