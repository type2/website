Got home today with my new project, a '67 Walk-Thru Pop Top.  Been thinking
about getting a camper for a while but not seriously until Thom put his &quot;55
up for sale.  Then I decided that I needed a camper.  Bought it Wednesday
and flew to LA Saturday to pick it up.  It's beautiful.  Mostly orginal
paint, Pearl White (buffed in few places to the primer), with only one major
cancer spot along the bottom of the cargo doors and sill.  The kit is
compleatly intact including the child cot, screen cover for rear hatch and
filler seat for the walk thru.  Everything works and is clean.  The entire
break system was recently rebuilt as well as the front beam and the
transmission (with 4th gear FF).  The motor is a 1600 SP that looks like the
orginal.  The engine compartment is rust and corrosion free as well as the
undercarrage.  There's aftermarket safari's and a shift lock.  I drove it up
the coast (HiWay 1) stopping at Pismo Beach to spend the night Sunday and
everything ran smooth and strong.  Finished the trip today and were bonded.
I plan to use her this summer for weekend camping and then began work in the
fall.  A little body work here and there and a paint job.  There had been
air scoops and the screw holes are left.  Also a PO had truck mirrors at one
time, more holes to fill.  Little dents and scratches, mostly around the
bottom edges.  All in all this camper has been taken care of for most of
it's years.  As I look it over to see what I need to do I keep finding
little treasures.  This morning I inspected the spair tire.  New!!!!  Never
been on the ground.  I do need to replace the wood panels on the rear hatch
and cargo doors and a couple of the release latches on the kit.  The
clincher to the sale was the personalized plate........&quot;WSTFLIA&quot;
See ya on the road.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
