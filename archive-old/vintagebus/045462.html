Sorry for not getting back to those who responded to the original posting 
more quickly.  I worked one day, interviewed the next, and it rained the 
third.  Bus is outside and I really want to look at the condition of 
everything before I quote prices.  I have printed off the messages of those 
seeking parts and will be contacting the *first person to request* a 
particular part with a price soon, hopefully later to day. 

Thanks,
Dan
