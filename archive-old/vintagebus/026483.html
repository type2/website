Why don't YOU ask Mr. Hamill for some info? Can't you just give us your
knowledge without running to Mr. Hamill? I am just stating what I PERSONALLY
have experienced, and tidbits that I have learned over the years. I
referenced Mr. Swangstu because, in my opinion he is the authority for early
westy's. And yes, I do think that you were wrong about the color
availability for the different years. But that is OK, now you have learned
and you can pass that along to someone else someday :)
