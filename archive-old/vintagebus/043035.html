Subject: Dual Carb setup for sale

Okay listees,

I have a pair of what I believe are &quot;Kadron-type&quot; carbs plus all linkages
and such for sale. They have the following ID stuff on 'em:

SOLEX - Brosol

H40/44E15

with manifolds, all hardware, air cleaners. 

They ran fine last year, til I removed their engine and went back to a 34
PICT on the new engine.

I don't have a clue as to what they are worth, but damned if I'm ever
gonna throw out anything that fits on a VW bus! 

Would $50 plus shipping be fair to anyone here needing them?

I am in Palo Alto, CA, and prolly would prefer selling them to someone who
can pick them up, so' s they know what they're gettin', but UPS is on my
way to work, so...


There's also their friendly buddie, a 009 distributor that I could throw
in also. 


Come and git'em!
