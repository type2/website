For as long as I've been into VW's, I've wanted to get up to the show in
Auburn Hills for the Volkswagen of America Headquarters show.   I'd see
pictures in the rags every year with lots of kewl stuff, and listen to the
stories of the rockin' good time had the night before with free eats and
beer provided by VW, live bands, etc.  Every year though, something would
keep me from going...  unable to get time off work, no money, bus broken,
etc.  So, with all this free time I've had lately, I vowed that this would
be the year I make it!  And with the 'Return to the Fatherland&quot; tour
stopping buy, there couldn't be a better year to do it!

First order of business would be to whip the turkis Turd into shape...
there was no way I was going to trust that weak, overheating Single-Port
motor to make the trip (it would be about 1,200 miles round-trip).  I
decided to put the old Dual-Port engine back in, and just deal with the
herky-jerky ways of a DP motor for a little while longer.  I started on
Wednesday afternoon, and planned on leaving Friday.   I pulled the SP motor
out of the bus, and stripped it down, as I would be needing to use the
exhaust, fuel pump, some tin, etc from it on the new (old) engine.  I also
had to prep and paint several new pieces of tin, including a new fan housing
with working flaps, and head tin pieces.  With the motor out, I wriggled it
&gt;from the jack and onto a big bucket to use as a platform for mantling.  I
managed to get the SP long block off, and the DP long block on the bucket by
myself.  As I was cleaning and assembling as much of the engine as I could,
I set about painting the new tin.  It was getting to be one of those typical
St. Louis 98% humidity days though, and after 10 hours under lamps and with
a fan blowing, the tin STILL wasn't dry!!   The fan housing was the worst..
still very tacky.  There were also other problems to contend with. I had to
wait until Thursday to run down to archway, as I was out of gasket sets, and
I needed a few other odds and ends that I didn't have on hand for a
dual-port.

So it's now Thursday afternoon, I've got a half-assembled motor, and I'm
still waiting for the fan housing to dry.  In a marathon overnight session,
I finished mantling the engine, complete with still sticky fan housing.  One
problem however, was that it was quite late when I finally finished the
engine, and I had no help to get the turn-key engine off the bucket and down
onto the jack!  So I developed an intricate contraption of old 2x4 scraps,
plywood and levers to get the motor off the bucket, and then dropped it on
the floor anyway...  I also got quite anal with the fit of the tin, and even
went to Home Depot for foam insulating tape to refurbish the foam around the
oil cooler, and seal up the tin around it.   I got the motor in, all the
electrical hooked back up, the throttle and heat cables, ducts, air cleaner,
and so on.  At 3 AM, I finally set out on a victory test drive.  20 miles on
the highway revealed great power, and my heads never went over 350 degrees,
and my oil was running a full 40 degrees cooler than it used to in this
engine with all the tin sealed up nice and neat!

Back home I began packing, gave the dog a bath, as he would be going with me
on this journey, did some last minute laundry, and get as much as I could
into the bus. With that all said and done, I grab a quick nap for a couple
hours, and head out to the grocery store, and run a few errands before I
leave.  My plans were to catch up with the Fatherland tour guys and the DBG
in Kalamazoo that night, and figure things out from there.  I knew some
folks were planning on camping at Pontiac Lake recreation area, so I could
always catch up with them there.

I finally got on the road, and out of St. Louis about 1:00PM.  Weather was
cloudy and overcast, but at least it was cool out.  At about 4 or 5 though,
things really cleared up, and got a little warm out in the sun.  I was
making pretty good time, being able to sustain 60mph quite easily now, and
even found a couple of semi's driving rather conservatively, and was able to
draft them for quite  a while.  I appeared to be getting great gas mileage
too!   Just south of the Chicago area, I stopped for my 1st fill up, and I
was getting about 25mpg! Woohoo!!  Happy days are here again!   I arrived in
the Chicago area about 6PM, in near record time for me, and just in time for
Friday night rush-hour traffic.  The tollway into Indiana was the worst of
it, driving for I would guess 10 miles or more in 1st gear only, and for no
apparent reason... no accidents or nothing were to be seen.

I stopped for a light dinner (tuna salad and crackers) at the Michigan
welcome center about 8PM.  ( I hadn't realized yet that I had crossed into a
new time-zone).  After un-tangling the dog from a light post he had wrapped
himself around a few dozen times, I set back on the journey.  My plans were
to hopefully meet up with the Fatherland Tour folks in Kalamazoo, where they
were staying at a hotel that wasn't on any of my maps.  Well, Kalamazoo came
and went, and I never saw any signs or anything for the elusive hotel.  I
decided the best course of action would be to drive past Kalamazoo and stay
at a rest area for the night, and surely I would catch them in the morning
when they drove past.

I woke up about 7AM the next morning (or so I thought), and had myself the
traditional camping breakfast of mini-powder doughnuts and orange juice, did
my rest-stop morning sink-bath routine, and all was well.  While cleaning up
in the restroom though, and old man came in and asked if I was with the big
caravan of Volkswagens.  Big caravan!  Where!? I asked.   He tells me that
just about 1/2 hour ago, he'd passed a bunch of 'really old looking VW's' on
the highway just outside of Kalamazoo.  Holy Crap!  That's them!  He tells
me they should be passing by here any minute!  So I gather myself up as
quick as I can, throw the dog in, and bolt outta the rest stop.  I drive
ahead a few exits, and decide to pull over on the side of the highway and
wait a while.   Not ten minutes later, I catch a glimpse of a bus roof in my
side-mirror.  Over the hill they come, and passing me suddenly was a late
bus in the lead, then a REALLY OLD KdF Wagen, a few split-oval bugs, a
Rometcshe (sp?), a few Hebmuellers, some oval bugs, and last but not least,
with a toot of the horn, Bill Bowman and Tom Neidenhoffer come whizzing by
in Bill's bug.

I jumped onto the end of the caravan after Bill, and followed along a few
exits where they all stopped to gas up before heading into Detroit.  I was
met right away by Tom, who made a hasty greeting, then dashed off for the
restroom.  That would be the last I saw of Tom for the rest of the weekend!!
I recognized Bill Collins right away, having met him before when he was
driving his Heb out to Kalifornia. I met Lorenzo Smith(?), who is probably
permanently crippled by now from being trapped in his single cab for the
entire journey (Lorenzo is about 6'6&quot; at least, and was hurting pretty badly
when we met Saturday). And then I met my New Hero in life, Dick Christensen,
the hardest hard-core VW person on the planet. Dick is driving his
Beautifully restored '43 KdF Wagen on the trip!  WOW.  I ran into Kim and
Chuck Fryer of the DBG as well, who were driving yet another VW I've never
seen them in before.  I was filled in on the camping situation for the
weekend, and told that the rest of the DBG were already at Pontiac Lake
state park.

After getting gas, everyone started back out on the tour, and off to the
hotel they were booked at.  I was getting pretty tired of only doing 45mph
or so, and instead of driving into Detroit with them, peeled off at the exit
to Pontiac Lake.   Despite the crappy directions from my AAA program, I made
it to the campground just in time to catch Crusty, Dawn, Matt, Woody, Chris
&amp; Juliet, and Dawn's mom whose name I've already forgotten, finishing up a
late breakfast.  I was greeted with a big cheer from Woody and Matt, who
seemed WAY to happy to see me - me thinks perhaps the 'Beast' had already
been tapped into for the day &lt;grin&gt;.  This was my 1st time hanging with the
DBG for the year, so we had lots to catch up on...  A tour of the recent
improvements to the Turd was had, my 'Red Stripe' Jamaican beer was sampled,
and after a few hours it was decided to make our way to the VWoA
headquarters for the traditional pre-show tailgate (deck-lid??) party.


It was at this time, I learned that everything you've ever heard about the
roads in Detroit is absolutely true.  From the campground to the VWoA
Headquarters it should have been a straight shot.. about a 10 minute drive
down a local road.  Instead, we were treated to a torn-up pavement road, the
most obnoxious traffic jam I've ever experienced, and detours that took us
miles out of the way.  All in all, it took us probably 45 minutes or more to
get to the Headquarters.


As you may know, much of the popularity of this show (and the reason I've
been wanting to get to it for so long) has to do with the infamous party the
night before.  In years past, VW would provide a huge free BBQ and beer,
live music, and have camping right there on the parking lot.  This year
however, it turns out they're not doing that, but instead having a
'invitation only' style dinner that you had to reserve seats at months ahead
of time, AND pay for it...  Man, I always miss  out on the good schwag....
There were still a lot of people who showed up that evening.  While there,
I was asked countless times if the hatch on the roof of my Westy was
original, Teddy the Amazing No-Brains Wonder Dog about took the ear off a
large Retriever that sniffed his butt one too many times, and I noticed a
flat tire on the front of the bus!  While the guys departed for the fine
dinning provided by VW, Dawn , her mom and I limped off to the nearest gas
station.  There I aired up the tire, but heard the distinctive sound of
hissing air.  A closer inspection of the tire revealed a large gouge out of
the center of the tread!  It w like somebody took an angle grinder to this
one section of tread!  And the rest of the tire was perfectly fine!  I
fitted the spare, which turns out was WAY smaller than the rest of my tires,
and we drove over to a very nice Italian restaurant for some fine dinning.

After dinner, we headed back to the campground, through the detours (a
different route), through a traffic jam for a Hanson concert or something
(I've never seen more teeny-bopper girls in cars in my life), and through
another traffic jam due to the construction that was even MORE obnoxious
than the first one!  We stopped for a few provisions at the corner gas
station, and there we were met by fellow DBG'ers Neil (with the
bubble-panel), that guy with the titty-pink late model, and some other dude
I can't remember.

Back at the campground, it was time to commence drinking.  The campers next
to us treated us to a variety of very loud hip-hop music, and we enjoyed our
array of micro-brews and salsa.  It was pretty late by the time Woody and
the gang returned from the evens festivities at the hotel, and we all stayed
up late in to the night.  I don't think a DOE was chosen for this even.. did
no one even qualify???  Geesh, we must be getting old or something!
