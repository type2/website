Subject: '59 Kombi...valve adjustment and heater system

Friday I got to the 500 mile mark on the engine in my bus. I 
tore-down and overhauled this engine myself. It was my first time to 
crack the case and to the whole sha-bang. So today I decided to 
change the oil and check the the valve adjustment.

After I got done changine oil and making minor vavle adjustments, I 
fired up the engine and got ready to head to town for our local VW 
club meeting. But when I went to hop in the bus and take off, I heard 
a loud &quot;rat-a-tat-tat-tat&quot; coming from inside one of the valve/head 
covers. DAMN!!!! So I hopped in the good 'ol VW rescue vehicle ('88 
Suburban) and sadly headed to the meeting.

I have to say it really sucked seeing everyone drive off for a club 
cruise in their cars and not being in my bus. Oh well.

When I got home the engine was nice and cool. I pulled off the head 
cover and of course found a loose adjuster. Turns out I forgot to 
torque down one of the adjuster nuts and the adjuster easily wiggled 
loose. So I fixed it and took the bus for a spin. Problem solved.

I also had hooked up my heater system today and it was working as 
good as a commercial VW bus heater system can. Better than nothin' I 
guess. I think I'm gonna put a curtain right over the bulk head to 
help keep it a little warmer up front. We'll see.

See Ya!
