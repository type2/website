&lt;&lt; We have a new roof

Hi Philip &amp; Catherine,
What are you planning to carry on top?  We pack our two German roof racks 
full of those Rubbermaid storage containers full of swap goods, drive to 
Sacramento, and back to the Seattle area.  A total of about 1400 miles round 
trip.  We have even loaded up a bug chassi pan on top of this while still in 
N. Cal., and drove home without problems.  If you have the proper tires, 
shocks, and front anti-sway bar you really have no problems as long as you do 
not drive like you are in the Le Mans race.   Eric&amp;Barb
