&lt;&lt; Does anyone know if I can add a little bit of silicone or something under 
the seal to help keep water out?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Taylor,
Use roofing tar.  Either fibered or non-fibered.  VW used sealant in all 
thier fixed window glass between the rubber and boby.  It is also a good idea 
to install a thin bead of tar between the glass and rubber to prevent the 
water getting to the edge of the laminate glass where the moisture turns the 
plastic layer inside white.
  We did try over a dozen sealants before using tar.  Silicon was next to 
useless.
