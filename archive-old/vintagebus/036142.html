&lt;&lt; Clara,
 
 Are there pictures of this feat around.   How did you suport the second bus? 
   How did you remove the second bus upon return?
 
 If this bus ontop a bus thing is true, I am really interested in 
 hearing/seeing how this was done!
 
 Heck, if it worked well....   Maybe I might try it?  :o)
  &gt;&gt;

ps, it is really not too safe, I kept my speed down to 45mph on the way back, 
because of vastly decreased cornering and braking abilities.  The bus was top 
heavy in a bad way.   I was extra concious of driving the whole way home.   
The rack it was cracked by overloading.  It was crazy, not what I would call 
a fun thing to do, and if you dont have experience with hauling stuff I would 
definately not do it, and only then if you are very careful.  

On that same trip (pre loading) I also did some interesting offroad camping, 
in getting to which I temporarily got stuck in a ditch at an precarious 
angle.   How tippy could it get and not fall over?  This was, of course 
intentional, and caused no hassles, and it did happily leave the ditch, and  
procceed through the big rocks and desert.   Not recommended if you care 
about your paint job.
