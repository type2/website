John writ:
&gt;So what is involved in the rebuild of a carb and is a rebuilt carb as good
as a new one? &lt;

The carb is pretty easy to rebuild if you are tedious in doing it.  When
disassembling the carb be very careful and remember how it all fits
together, the manuals have good helper diagrams also which you probably
already have at home.  The trick to adjusting it right when rebuilt is to
count the rotations IN for the adjustment screws, count the rotations in
then when rebuilt just back them out that many rotations then you have the
same baseline as before.

Get a can of carb cleaner (aka toxic nuclear waste green death in a can) and
soak the parts for two days.  Take the pieces out and wash them off, then go
(shop, friend, etc) and use an air compressor to thoroughly blow out all the
carb orifices.  Now you can reassemble with a fresh carb rebuild kit, carb
rebuild kits should be easy to come by.

Total investment is about $25, $10 carb cleaner and $15 carb rebuild kit.
Much cheaper than a new carb and now you are more intimate with it if you
have carb woes in the future.

Also at this time it is a good idea to get a larger main jet so the heads
run a little wetter and cooler.  I recommend a 135.  Save a bundle and find
a motorcycle shop that carries Minuki carb jets because they fit perfect and
only cost about $2.50 versus about $12 for a Solex jet (if you can even find
the size you want).

One thing to watch for is that the throttle arm does not leak on the sides.
If it does the throttle arm will need rebushed which I would not try myself,
but would be an extra expense to fix.  I have not seen a used carb that
needed rebushed from my limited experiences.

Good Luck!
