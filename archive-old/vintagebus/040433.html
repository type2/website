The exact same thing happened in my '64 beetle.  It had a hack of a 12v conversion and early taillights that looked cool but didn't work well.  Anyway, I went through and yanked all the wire that didn't belong there (old speaker wire, bare stuff just laying around in the trunk), changed brakelight switch (which needed doing anyway) and re-wired the tail-lights.  If any of this sounds like you, you may want to look into some of these things.  This fixed it.  I'm not sure which fixed it but after that night (with a TON of help from my local VW guru) all things were well.
