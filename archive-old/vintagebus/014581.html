ya i have heard of that also....but seems to be more involved...never done it
personally.  it might be a easy fix......my only reservation about doing that
is getting the ends straight( i am assuming you pullout the rounded tip on one
end...an dcut off a bit of the end and then put the rounded tip back in)  how
do you assure that you will cut a stright line and the tip seats in the rod
correctly...............hmmmmmm...but i ve never done it...let me know what
you decide to do and if it works i d be interested..............
