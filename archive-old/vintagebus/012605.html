&gt; Gas Guage does not work
&gt; In process of changing ignitions noticed that the
&gt; guage would register for a breif second and than go
&gt; back to zero.
&gt;
The gauge itself grounds on the dash via the mounting
clamp.  I loosened the clamp a bit on a SC once and scraped
it around a bit, that started it working for me.

It sounds like you either:
1. Grounded the gauge temporarily while switching out the
ignition switch and got a reading or
2. You got power to the gauge momentarily and you have a
short.  Have you checked for power to the gauge too?

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a wiring diagram for ya on

Without knowing anything about anything, I'd go with #1.
