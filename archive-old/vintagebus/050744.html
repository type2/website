Subject: Re: [VB] OCTO Feb 2002 pictures

I agree totally!!  There is a certain past president of the ABC who drives a 
certain primered panel that has had one of these on its nose for several 
months now.  He told me that it cost him all of about $3 for the paint.  How 
many split bus drivers do not have a spare emblem laying around?  Or just do 
your one and only!!
