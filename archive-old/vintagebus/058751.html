Subject: RE: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Let me chime in as well;
I drive my '67 every day (its my only car, although the boss-lady has a j**p
when we need to head cross-country or need something to tow behind our old
RV); it makes going to work worth it.  I drive about 7 miles each way in
local traffic thru Lakeland FL, which is 30ish miles from Tampa.  Although I
drove it once on the interstate, I am of the belief that interstate driving
in a bus is not for the faint-of-heart (or wusses like me!!)

...  VERY few splits here in Tampa that I see out and about.  Though just
this morning a single cab passed me on the Interstate with a big Brotherhood
of Electricians sticker on the back.
Mike, I think I saw this SC a while back on 275 in the downtown area.  It
was green as I recall and it was in awesome shape.

There is a pink splittie in the Lakeland (my oldest daughter tells me) area,
although I have never seen it myself.  She saw my car in a parking lot one
day and the pink one had pulled up beside my blue bus (checking me out I
guess).
She said, &quot;It was cute; a boy bus and a girl bus.&quot;  Gag
