Subject: Re: [VB] Dying at stop lights -me too.

Hi Wade,
  A couple of years ago, I had a 69 westy with a 1600 dp and 009 dist.
I had the same problem with it dying whenever I stopped. I checked 
everything I thought.  Someone suggested changing out the condenser.
I did, and it fixed it. Good luck,
Wayne

&gt;Ive been having this same problem, and i dont have vaccuum advance, nor do 
&gt;i
&gt;have a fuel cutoff solenoid. Just started dying at stoplights one day and
&gt;never got better. have installed new points, set timing/dwell, checked all
&gt;electrical wires, checked plug wires for shorts, changed rotors/caps,
&gt;removed carb and cleaned out multiple times. checked intake manifold (its a
&gt;16 single port)....yet it still does it. This is my only daily driver _at_60
&gt;miles a day so i cant keep it off the road for too long. I just bumped up
&gt;and disconnected the auto choke to keep it from dying until I could figure
&gt;it out (of course idles high now). I actually lost 10mpg by that slight
&gt;adjustment. Engine has 10k miles on it now with every single bolt on part
&gt;new 10k miles ago.. Only thing I haven't had a chance to check yet is to
&gt;re-adjust the valves .... is it possible that your valves can go that far
&gt;out of wack from normal use/normal circumstances that the engine would want
&gt;to die?

&gt; &gt;Are you sure about the wire to the fuel cutoff solenoid on your carb?
&gt; &gt;If the voltage falls below the cutoff threshold, it's stallsville.
