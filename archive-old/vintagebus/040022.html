Sorry if this question has come up and I missed it, but I need interior 
panels and seat covers for my 67 21 Window walk-thru.  I am finally going to 
attempt to put it on the road in the next couple of months after a 3 year 
holding pattern.  How is TMI???  I hear they put out a decent product.   I 
am thinking of something in middle in line, I am not doing a perfect $35k 
resto on this one........  More like a $5k resto :)

Who does headliners/sliding rags for busses in the Sacrameto area??

Also, to save the list from more repeated questions from people like myself, 
is there not an archive somewhere that we can search for topics that have 
already come up?  Where do you go?

TIA
