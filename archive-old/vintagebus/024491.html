Subject: lowering 67 split window

I have a '67 splitty which has been tastefully restored by a previous
ovner.  I'm getting some Wolfsburg nipple hubcaps tomorrow which should
make it look even better.
what I would like to do is to drop it by about 2&quot; all around, but am
unsure as to the best method. I've seen it done on other busses and it
looks really cool.

Why don't more volksy enthusiasts use BLAUPUNKT audio equipment to keep
with the quality of German engineering? 

Just for the count,
