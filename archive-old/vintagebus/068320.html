Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Left Rear Brakes (sometimes)

...
&gt;      Here is the latest one that has so far evaded correction. My left
&gt; rear brakes are dragging sometimes. The drum gets hot while the other
&gt; three stay almost cold. This has been happening for around a month. I
&gt; have readjusted the brakes, removed the drum around 6 times, replaced
&gt; the shoes, replaced the brake cyl., replace the spring hardware, added
&gt; spots of grease to prevent binding. All looks fine when its apart. Then
&gt; I put it back together and drive it. It still gets hot.

I dont see brake hose. The hose on that side is possibly collapsed inside.
If you have a bad one you should probably replace all 4 if they are of
unknown age.
