Subject: RE: [VB] Valve problem...Whats hapening here?!?!?!

I just had my #3 exhaust valve do this.  You have either a stretched
valve or a sinking valve seat.  Either way, pull the engine and fix the
head.

I went to adjust my valves on my 1600 DP today.  ANd
the number 2 valve is giving me a problem.  No matter
how far I back off the adlusting screw, I cannot get a
feeler between.  It's like the valve is sticking so
far out (open) that it is pressing against the rocker
arm where the adjusting screw goes thru.
