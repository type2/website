Subject: 66 EZ Camper FS

While &quot;shopping&quot; yesterday (that's what I *try* do every Friday) I cam
across a 66 EZ Camper. It's been sitting for many years. Body is ok,
bumps and dings here and there. There is a motor that &quot;ran when parked&quot;
of course, most of the interior is there (rough). It is missing the rear
bumper, apron and decklid but otherwise seemed complete it even has the
windshield washer bottle (broke though). It's on a 12+ acre lot of cars,
trucks, firetrucks, (Greyhound style) Buses, boats, etc. Of course in
the middle. When I asked the old guy that owes it what the easiest why
to get a car out of there was his reply was &quot;cash&quot; ok how about
physically out of here then I say. He reply was &quot;when it dries up (3-4
days) I'll pull it out to the road for you&quot; so if anyone os interested
let me know and I'll go back in a few days and get pictures.
