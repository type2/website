&gt; Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

&gt; Unbelievable! No tire shop in town has the &quot;spider&quot; adopter to balance the
&gt; tires on my 1967 21DLX! I get the same story, need the adopter to balance!
&gt; Is this a part that can be purchased? Or am I SOL? Any comments,
&gt; observations, or cuss words will be appreciated.

IF you have a spare drum (bus or beetle) bolt it to the tire and the
result will fit on most spin balancers.  Spin the drum by itself first to
make sure that it is in balance.
