Just have Thom's girlyfriend drive it down and then he'll only have to bring
one bus and you could pay his gas home as VWHowards paying his gas down. See
Thom it's almost free and think maybe because of the Stink Thom raised he
could possibly get comp passes or the list can get a collection and pay his
entry fees.
