Rex,
I was kicking around making one up for my DC and calculated that I could fit a
25-27 gallon tank in the DC area.
That still left space on the sides of the tank for the FI fuel pump and filter.
I had planned on making it out of aluminum welding it up and all, then changed my
mind.  When I finally get around to the project, I will be making it out of
composites.  Should be lightweight and strong.  Before I start on the project, I
gotta finish putting the SBC into the Jag.  Can't have both vehicles out of
service at the same time.

Nothing like having a 500 mile radius on a tank of gas.

&gt; Has anyone ever made a gas tank? I was looking at the area for the
&gt; gas tank for my '59 SC. As you know, you get to it from the storage
&gt; area under the bed. When the gas tank is in place, there are some
&gt; panels that keep you from seeing it. So I was thinking about making a
&gt; gas tank to TOTALLY fill the area where it is supposed to be
&gt; installed. Seems like I could get a pretty big more square tank in
&gt; there that would hold more gas.
