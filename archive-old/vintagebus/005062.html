&gt; Hello list!
&gt;
&gt; Mark your calendars for Sept. 15-17! 2nd annual Josh Rodgers Memorial Beer
&gt; Bash will be taking place just outside of  Davis, Oklahoma at Turner Falls
&gt; state park located about 80 mi. south of Oklahoma City on I-35 exit 51.
This
&gt; is a family camp-out, so don't let the name fool you. If you knew Josh,
you
&gt; know how Art Long came up with the name. It is a beautiful camp-ground
with
&gt; full facilities, swimming, hiking,  waterfalls over 100' tall, and even an
&gt; old castle to explore! This event is aimed at TypeII's, but all makes of
&gt; VW's are welcome.
&gt;   Fri. evening will be for setting up camp, socializing, part swapping or
&gt; whatever. Sat morning Art has put together a scenic cruise to a couple
&gt; nearby towns, and will also include a poker run featuring some unusual,
and
&gt; fun door prizes! We will then take a caravan (for those interested)
through
&gt; Arbuckle Wilderness. This park features wild animals, some of which you
can
&gt; feed through the window of your bus! Isn't that what safari windows were
&gt; made for?! Sat. evening will be more socializing, good times, and even an
&gt; engine case burn in memory of Josh. Sun. we will cool off at the swimming
&gt; hole (with diving boards and slides) before everyone heads out.
&gt;   Last year we were delighted to host several listees, and we hope to see
&gt; even more this year. We already have more reservations than attended last
&gt; year. This is a very fun camp-out in memory of a guy who did a lot for the
&gt; Type II community!
&gt; If you are interested in coming, or seek further info feel free to E-mail
&gt; me. We are trying to get an idea on the number of people attending as we
are
&gt; going to have a private area of the park and make t-shirts. Hope to see
you
&gt; there!
&gt;
