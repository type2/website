Finding GL4
,

If there is an additive package for GL5 which harms early trannies, then how 
could that oil be rated for GL4? I'm thinking that perhaps Valvoline has 
come up with an additive package which can meet BOTH performance standards.  
Isn't this a possibility?

This thread went around during last August I believe and someone was nice 
enough to provide me with a web page to Valvoline which explained it some. 
The GL ratings have to do with pressure and temperature endurance of the 
fluid. I'm pretty sure GL4 specifications are a lower pressure and 
temperature than GL5,6 etc. The point is that the older vehicles required 
less of the fluid and thus the fluid had fewer additives. The GL ratings are 
not based on content, additives or what they will or will not corrode. It is 
simply that at GL5 or 6 will also meet the temp and pressure requirements of 
a GL4. So for advertisement sake the manufacturer says GL 4,5,6. Phosphorus 
is added to make the oil more endurant and that is what eats the syncros. A 
GL5 may exceed the needed temp and pressure of our VW trannys, but it has 
had phosphorus added. The straight GL4 is the only one that doesn't have the 
harmful additives but still meets the trannys needs. Hope that helps.
