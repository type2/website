&gt; Then I get a phone message last Saturday.  Curt says I had a one-
&gt; year-only oil pump that didn't quite match up with my case.  Not
&gt; surprising that I missed that, really - the case has no numbers &amp;
&gt; has been only tentatively identified as a '70 or '71.  &quot;Pump probably

    it's not surprising that you put in the wrong oil pump, joe; people do
it all the time. where you really screwed up was by not doing a test fit and
alignment check between the pump body holes and the oil galley holes in the
case.

    this procedure should always be followed on every acvw engine assembly,
regardless of your knowledge of the engine case numbers.
