 I'm thinking about rebuilding my engine. How do I know what to order 
 (sizes)?  Any preferences on what company I should get the parts from?  My 
 problem right now is it is buring oil and I get low gas mileage. I want to 
 get the oil problem fixed so I don't get my plugs so dirty and then 
 hopefully the plugs will fire better and my mileage will increase.
 
 I don't know much about the engine because there are no numbers to be found 
 on the case. It is a DP. and I did see numbers on the cylinder heads 
 once(inside the covers) but wasn't sure if those meant anything. Thanks for 
 the help.

I would read through the engine rebuild section in your Idiots book several 
times.  

there is no number by the gen stand on the case?  okay- is there a number on 
top by the seam- then it is a type 3 case.  some cases are the cases bought 
later, not used from a car, and have no serial number.     There would be a 
part number on the case by where the push rod tubes go in it.

try this:  take hold of crank pulley and push pull.   you may want to remove 
your fan belt.   it should move a hair (.004 to .006&quot;)  if it goes thunk 
thunk your main bearings are worn.   a small amount of excessive end play can 
be taken out by reshimming, but it may be a sign the bottom end (inside the 
case) needs redoings.  If you can lift the crank up/down, definately full 
rebuild time.  yes I found this once.

okay, now put the fan belt on, warm the motor up, then take all the plugs out 
and do a compression check.    they should all be above 100 and close 
together.   

however, I must say i drove a motor that had compression on 3 cylinders 120, 
and #3 had 105, for 3 years with no problem, then  it didn't run right 
anymore, turned out #3 went down to 65.    so you think about performance too.

you dont knoe bearing sizes unitil you have the old bearings off to see what 
sizes they are.
