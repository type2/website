Subject: RE: [VB] Throttle cable question

When I got my '67 tipper, I had a similar experience...  First of all, the
only spring is the one on the carb.  To make things right: pull out the
original cable and then use it as a snake (you know, one of those things you
clean a drain pipe with) to clean out the tube.  Note that you need to snake
from the front and then from the back since there is a section in the middle
where the cable is just in the air.  Next, carefully disassemble, clean, and
reassemble the pedal linkage up front making sure you grease the pivot pin
when putting it back together.  After I did that, mine worked perfectly.

Good luck.

  My 63' bus has a 16DP with a 34 pict 3.  Right now,
the only return spring for the thottle is the one on
the carb. It isn't strong enough to fully return the
pedal.  Should there be an additional return spring
somewhere?  The original cable was pretty rough, so I
already replaced it (fully greased ) but it made
little difference.
