&lt;&lt; What if there was a fabricated drip tray installed in the door that would
catch the water and transfer it to tubes that would then transfer the water
to the holes at the bottom of each door? This wouldn't be that  hard to
fabricate. Any thoughts?&gt;&gt;
  Hi Jason,
    We have thought of using this tube idea for the doglegs.  Unfortunitly
for the doors and especially the front doors you would have to weld these
drip trays into the door.  Due to the fact that of how the door window frames
are bolted into the door and this means that the water is dripping down the
inside of the door sheetmetal.

 &lt;&lt;The other thought would be to use a zinc plate under the rubber, where
 water comes in. Water picks up microscopic bits of zinc before it goes
 down your dooor. Rust cant handle water mixed with zinc, and wont form. &gt;&gt;
      Hmm, Kind of doubt that any microscopic amount would be the protector
of the sheet metal.  Since using zinc content primer of less than 85% zinc
content is a waste of time and money it seems that you would have to have a
certain percentage of zinc per amount of water to work.  Eric &amp; Barb
