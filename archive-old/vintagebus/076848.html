Subject: thermostat bracket pics

well i couldn't get a pic of the early bracket installed as the muffler was 
in the way.  Perhaps my bus still had the bracket as it was off teh road for 
the 70s and 80s.  

 but here's pics of 3 kinds of brackets, FWIW.   you can also do a search in 
the VB gallery for 'thermostat'
