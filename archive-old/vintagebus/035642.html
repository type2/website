&lt;&lt; Sounds like it is time to start the search again.  Anyone out there have
an NOS pre 64 washer bottle they want to part with?&gt;&gt;
Good luck finding a NOS one!

&lt;&lt;How did the flexible bottle hold up?&gt;&gt;
Well only one of the four that we have found has a crack in it and that
should be easy to repair.

&lt;&lt; What do they cost if and when you can find them?&gt;&gt;
For less than they should have gone since the volks selling them did not know
what they were or care since they were just cleaning out thier garages.  Not
to be snotty about the price.  It is kind of like the time we needed a -3 cam
for a 36 HP engine.  After looking for two years for a new German one and
having friends looking as far away as Greece for it, we finally found a place
that would regrind our good core and reharden it properly.  Six months after
the engine was together we found a NOS one in an attic storage area with lots
of black widow spiders of an old VW repair shop which the owner offered it to
us for one dollar.  It is the fact that we had to travel all over the western
U.S. for so long to find this part that we sure would not sell it for a buck!

&lt;&lt; Well I am trying to go all out to be correct, but I will use what I have
until I find the earlier one.&gt;&gt;
Well it only took us about six years to collect what we have so if you do
swap meets you should be able to find one soon.

 the early
 ones are chromed plated machined brass that look like a machine gun turret

&lt;&lt; These are the ones I have, and mine are pretty nice looking if I remember
right.  I'll have to be very careful with them now that I know they are
different than the later ones.&gt;&gt;
Good, we are going to replace the steel nuts on those with brass ones and
grease well.  The steel nuts rust to the nozzles and then you have to use a
vise grip to hold and marr (Yuck!) up the top of the nozzles while you wrench
off the nuts.

&lt;&lt;Thanks for the info.  The more I find and the more I learn the more parts I
need. &gt;&gt;
Suprise!   Eric&amp;Barb
