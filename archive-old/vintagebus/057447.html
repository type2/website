Subject: Re: Berg Shifter?

I'll add my $.02
  Berg's price is steep, I would have liked to get the 
lockout option but I was already choking on the price of 
the plain vanilla shifter!
  Expect to wait for it, I bought mine at the Berg rally 
after OCTO and didn't receive it for 3 months (it wasn't 
in stock, they had to make it for me). I finally had 
told them to either ship the shifter or my refund check. 
  It turns out the price and the wait are worth it. Best 
smiles/mile upgrade I've done, really shines in stop and 
go traffic! Makes the bus more comfortable to drive.
  BTW- When I bought mine they were going to stop 
producing the early ones (smaller, pre '60 ball) don't 
know if this has happened yet.
