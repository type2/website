Seems that the one on Everett's site would be hard to shift to 3 and 4th
gear with it cut right down the middle.  Probably had some kind of pretzel
shifter!!

Hmmm, interesting.  The one on my site was for sale for $500 (allegedly),
I told the guy that found it to go buy it NOW and I would pay him but it
disappeared soon after.

Here it is:

Note the relocation of the front turn signal.

That one was home-made but that '56 one looks to have real VW bed material
extended forward?  Looks like a Barndoor/Wolfsburg-style front bumper too.
 I'd be interested to know how the front bench seat was modified.
