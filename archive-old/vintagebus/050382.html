With the cold weather now settling in and a ski holiday to Norway 
coming up in February in which were taking the bus, has finally got 
me going on trying to get my early 6 volt BN4 Eberspächer heater 
working. I've never had it running in the five years I've owned the 
bus so last weekend I yanked the heater and put it up on the bench 
for a closer look. With the great instruction provided by Ron van 
Ness' web site I was able to give the heater a thorough check. But, I 
couldn't get ignition.

The VW shop in town has an enthusiastic young fellow at the parts 
counter that spent the better part of the afternoon working thorough 
his contacts list and tracked down an old timer that is an authorized 
Eberspächer mechanic. I rang him up and it took him all of a minute 
or so to get a rather clear picture of my heater; he was able to 
detail right down to the correct wiring harness. Anyway, he asked me 
to come over and his immediate response was it probably just needed a 
bit of coaxing and maintenance. He was sure he had no nos parts but 
thought there were a few boxes of used bits and pieces upstairs. So 
between Christmas and New Years he thought he'd be done and ready for 
me to come pick it up. We didn't discuss currencies, but he promised 
to call is there were any sudden surprises.

The reason I'm now desperately seeking heat is that I usually lay the 
bus up for winter, but I just got confirmation on a rather 
interesting job offer with the UN in Laos (Gender Expert with the 
Sekong Hill Tribes).  I've been working in Central and South America 
the last number of years and that has given me the chance a couple, 
or three times, a year to pick up spares while down there. South East 
Asia is a new region for me and I suspect there won't be many buses 
up that way. Though perhaps nearby Thailand might have something to 
offer. The job is a two year posting, and I leave in the beginning of 
April so I'm going to run the bus daily  until my departure, just to 
saturate the urge and then store the bus, bug and trailer while away 
the two years.
