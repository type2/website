I had a single port in my bus, changed to a dual port with a weber
progressive.  I can feel more power at lower speeds, but it take a
longer to reach 60 on the highway and it seems the engine is working
harder, higher revs.  The bus is a '67 with I believe the original
transaxel.  The single port felt slower at low speeds, but would cruise
75 on the freeway easily.  The dualport just doesn't want to move that
fast.  I was told the dualport was a 2110.
