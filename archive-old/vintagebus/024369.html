1. My recommendation for those who do not like customized Type 2s is to
look the other way when one goes by. There will always be contention
between the priesthood and the pagans. I still think the Splitty with
the 911T engine that I saw a couple of weeks ago was pretty cool.

2. The cute little aphorism about the pig is from Robert Heinlein's
&quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;.  More pertinent to Type 2s is, &quot;Natural laws
have no pity&quot;, same source.

3. &quot;Urge&quot;, the hideously ugly yet well beloved '66 Kombi remains in sad
need of a rear bumper.  If anyone has such a thing in decent shape, with
brackets, I would love to hear about it.
