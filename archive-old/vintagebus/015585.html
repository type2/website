Subject: Re: [VB] stainless rockers?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com



All the information is fascinating and informitive
but, uh, has it been answered yet as to how/ where/
when one can get stainless rockers?  I've heard of
someone fab'ing them, however the lucky-duck also has
his own ice-fishing holes, wood burning stove and
swivel lawn chairs.  I think those um, accessories are
fantastic, but I'm not as, uh, clever or talented to
do such things.  Still just wondering.  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt; Benj.
