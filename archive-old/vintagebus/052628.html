Wasnt there just a barndoor single cab firetruck on
ebay in that part of the world. It didn't sell but I
dont think it would go for much.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;  I am looking for a cheap bus in the south east ,any
&gt;  year. , I would prefer
&gt; it to be drivable but not necessary , I would buy
&gt; one without a motor as
&gt; long as I could put my 1600 motor in it. I would
&gt; like it to be cheap as
&gt; possible in the Carolinas , Georgia or VA. Of course
&gt; I am not expecting a
&gt; rust free bus , I just want a beater or something
&gt; with potential.
&gt; Thanks
