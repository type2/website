Subject: 24 hour canvas replacement / CYW

This applies to the 68- 69 short top westie. I know kinda rare, but also
applies to 67 and earlier I suppose, so a post to both lists.

I got a wild hair last night and decided to replace my pop-top canvas. After
Everybus, all the duct tape Chris Slaymaker had on hand would not put humpty
back together again. I had fabric from the curtain job left over so had
wifey sew me a loop of fabric in the style of the rotten stuff I ripped out.
1st mistake- the fabric shrinks over the years- cut it bigger.

Man those staples are in there solid, I'll never get them back in. Made a
frantic call to Boyd Smith as he just finished his 1967 job. Yep, he needed
an industrial strength electric staple gun to do the job. 2nd mistake- Did
not have access to one. Had to hammer every staple after placement. :-(

Started work in earnest this AM and after opening and shutting the thing
about ten times realized that  the top did not seem right . Upon examination
found that all the wood to fiberglass contact had broken down. I did not see
that with the rotten canvas on! I removed the top and cannot figure what
held it on the bus! Almost all the wood had separated from the fiberglass!
Off to Flaps for fiberglass cloth. While there found some stuff called
&quot;Bondohair&quot;. That looked good, so got that also. Re-did all the wood to wood
stuff with fiber cloth and polyester resin. Slathered the other contact
areas with the bondohair. Worked like a charm. Solid as a rock. Sanded it a
bit and threw on some white paint to cover the filler.

I put the top back on and went to work on the canvas. This is a complete
PITA. I have a sore neck just from the upper part.

Then, mistake #3: the upper part of the canvas is smaller that the lower
part (the portion that attaches to the body). I had Pam sew up a loop, so
the lower part was too tight. Damn. Fortunately our first measurement last
night was too big, so had a seam I could let out.

The lower trim was so hard I just slammed it in. I hope that when I get the
replacement (softer) trim I will be able to cut the seam some more and get
it to fit.

Bottom line:
1)Prolly much better to buy replacement canvas that is correct in size.
(busdepot 180 bucks)
2) Check your wood to top integrity.
3)Don't try it starting Saturday night!
4) All that said, looks pretty good!

Look for me at Circle yer Wagens next weekend!
