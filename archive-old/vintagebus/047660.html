Hi Volks,
Well hear is a subject that has bothered us for quite a while.  VW parts
manuals list different part numbers for fans for the type1 &amp; 2 engines, but
does not mention the change of these fans.  So do you have a fan with the
original VW sticker on it?  If so what is the width between the two discs
(Inside measurement.) that make the main body of the fan?  Would you mind
sending us the info so we could make a list of these part numbers and sizes.
So far as we have been able to figure the largest fan used on the stock
single port engines seems to have been a 29mm and the later doghouse fans
went from 33, 34, 34.4, and 35mm, but again we have no certain part numbers
for these!    Thanks,   Eric&amp;Barb
