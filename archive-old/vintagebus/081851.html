Summer  before last I bypassed my external oil cooler (stock oil cooler
removed  with a blockoff plate) and drove my 64 bus (1600 DP) around to watch
what  the temps would do.

As long as I kept it below 55mph, my oil temps  wouldn't reach 220. Head
temps did not change one bit from where they  normally ran. I drove for miles
and miles at 55mph, and my head temps  stayed at 320 to 340 and oil temps
hovered around 210 to  220.
