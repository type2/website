Hi Ray,
Thanks for the reminder!  Yes, there is more fan whistle with using a ratio 
starting somewhere above 2:1, but in our 1960 walk thru camper converted 
panel it is not a problem up in the front seats.  Eric is still able to read 
aloud to Barb while she is driving without shouting.  Eric did sleep in the 
back several times on the trip to/from Sacramento and found it very doable, 
but the person in the back can not hear conversations going on in the front 
seats due to the fan whistle.   Most of the fan whistle seems to come into 
the bus from the air pockets on both sides that allow the use of the of the 
air intake vents.  Since we have a bed and cabinets that cover the rest of 
the engine compartment sheet metal this might be helping greatly.  For a 
trike which the driver and any passenger would be right on the engine it 
would be an annoying amount of noise.  Plus for a light wieght small trike it 
probably would be not needed.  For the bus trying to keep up with freeway 
traffic, being heavier, larger and carrying/towing a heavier load it is 
needed in summer temps.
