Subject: Re: [VB] 30 Pict Jets

i find the stock specs with todays gas sorta like the 15% tipping 
rule... a good start, but feel free to go up!
conversely, go down at your peril  if you wish good service next time :)

my 30/31 IIRC came with a 120 main and a 130y emulsion tube, and a 65 
and 55 pilot and idle (or vice versa - i allus fergit which jet hole 
is which).

on the 1679cc, this failed emissions with excess hydrocarbon; tho it 
seemed contrary, karl aufever, ray heath and a few T2ers convinced me 
i was too lean. i went to a 125 main, a 125z emulsion, and upped both 
idle/pilots to 65. i passed, right in the middle of specs. i suspect 
that i can go up to 127.5, but haven't done so permanently...   i had 
done it for a week, thought it was too rich and switched back to 125, 
but hadn't changed the emulsion tube, so i might have some wiggle 
room in there yet.

i have the aircooled_dot_net a/f meter, and it usually shows me at the 2 
most-rich lights, which is where john says a bus should be.

modern fuels do NOT have the same characteristics as gas made when 
'without guesswork' was published - for ANY year. they are 
manufactured for knock-sensored, pollution-controlled watercoolers, 
and as far as i can tell from 2 years of digging through web and 
print resources, they burn a little  differently than the 89 octane 
vw is talking about in the owner's manual.

and when you remember that VW used unburned gas to help cool the 
intake valves, going too lean is just no good.

experiment (get a CHT!), and find a spot that seems to give decent 
mpg without performance issues or overheating.
