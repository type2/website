Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes

I'm constantly amazed when selling a car that is fairly priced that someone
will pass unless you knock another $50 off the price.  People pass on, and
end up doing without a great car because of $50????

I just don't understand.  I usually feel like I've overpaid for a car, but
long after I've forgotten about the extra $100 I might have paid, I've still
got &quot;The car of my dreams, (at least, my dreams at the time I bought it).

If a car isn't fairly priced in a buyers eyes, they should just pass on it,
rather than standing on the principle of &quot;If you take another $50 off the
price, I'll buy it&quot;.

Just my opinion, but some buyers are really idiots.

Ed
