hey a guy i know in berkeley hs a 67 with great dogs and real decent 
corners, basically he has today to get off whatever is needed as they will 
probably tow it tommorrow.

i could try to get stuff for the needy but i have minimal cash, i think the 
guy would hold the stuff if i could get it off the bus.
