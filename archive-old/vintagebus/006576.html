I have 2 seperate vehiles that both have 34PICT 3's and alternators.  Both
were done by others and each has a different &quot;fix&quot; one is the alternator is
ground away and on the other, the arm is ground down on the carb.  I can't
tell which is better, they both work ( as well as a 009/34PICT3 can).
