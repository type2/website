&gt; maybe i missed it, but what modifications do you need to do to make the
&gt; later tanks fit?  i tried putting a tank from a 70 in my 59 and it was too
&gt; deep to fit on the tray properly.  not to mention the straps (from the 70)
&gt; were also too short. i like the possibility of more gas capability, but
&gt; didn't like the way it fit in there.  i removed it and put the 59 tank back
&gt; in.
