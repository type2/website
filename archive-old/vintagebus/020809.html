&gt; weld on the back, right where the bowden tube fits on. this is not the

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; only noticed this on earlier busses (pre 63).

I've fixed this on two early t4 busses..a 72 and a 73.  These had actually
BROKEN the tube end off where it goes through that rearmost bracket.

In these cases I usually fab a sleeve to slip over the two parts and then
weld the sleeve to the original pieces of tube (being sure to get the
length of the new assembly right!)..then weld the sleeve to the bracket.
