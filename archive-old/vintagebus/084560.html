Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Flasher?

 I'll second what Matt said.
 
  On my 65, the emergency flasher is hidden under the pass 
side kick panel, while the turn signal flasher is by the fuse box
The TS flasher was replaced with a generic one from 
a FLAPS before I bought the bus.   Since I had it, the TS can went bad and I replaced it with a new one from a FLAPS.   
I am not requiring that my blinker can says \x/ and have a vw part number on it.  :)


In '66 they went to the 9-pine relay with everything in one box that is more 
expensive and harder to find.

Cleaning up connections and reconnection with di-electrical grease makes the 
electrics work better.  Dielectric grease really helps the overhead lights not 
squeak too.

&gt; 
&gt; ['63 Panel wiring] anyway I realized that this diagram has depicted a 
&gt; &quot;flasher relay&quot; and an &quot;emergency flasher relay&quot;. My bus doesn't have 
&gt; two relays let alone a stock one. 

On my '64, the flasher lives right next to the fuse box where you can 
see it, but you have to take down the lining in front of the passenger - 
around the right headlight bucket - to see the relay. If you haven't 
checked over there, you might find the disconnected relay lurking over 
there someplace.
