&gt; &lt;&lt;  The bus is
&gt;  sanded to 500 grit and i am ready to tape it off. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Mat,
&gt; &gt;From what we have read you really need to use 250-300 grit sandpaper.
&gt; Anything higher will be too smooth and not allow the new coat of paint to
&gt; adhere.  Resulting in paint that not only chips, but flakes off.  Hopefully
&gt; there is a painter out there that can tell for sure.    Eric &amp; Barb

  This was something that i had wondered about.  they sell sealer which will
fill the scratches the paper leaves.  However, the PPG literature specifies
that you sand with 400 or finer before aplication.  Hmmm.

Thanks
Matthew
