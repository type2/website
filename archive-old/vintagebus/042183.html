Easy.  Most mechanics have English-calibrated torque wrenches, so VW
provided english torque values.

I assume that mechanics in Metric countries get their specs in N-m (or in
some really twisted units like kg-m)  The use of kg in pressure and torque
units bothers me, since kg is a unit of _mass_ not force.  If you take
your bus to the Moon, it will have the same mass, but not the same weight
force!

George Lyle  &lt;--yes, I want to go to the Moon.  NASA promised me that I'd
be taking vacations there by now!
