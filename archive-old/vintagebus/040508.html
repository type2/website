Hey listees,

quick, stupid question.  I'm doing the doghouse cooler conversion for my 
1600, and I'm looking at my tin and thinking that I have the right pieces.  
My specific question is about the piece I believe is called the breastwork 
tin, front (FIF)of the fan shroud that meets up with the hump in the fuel 
tank floor over the tranny bell.  The exhaust ducting for the doghouse goes 
thru this piece.  I know that later bay busses used a different shape of the 
hump, leading to a different piece of tin.  Do splittys use the piece that 
is rounded on the top, or does it kinda flatten at the top?

Hoping I have the right one,

Mike A.
