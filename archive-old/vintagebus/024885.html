 I understood that the elephant mirrors were installed by dealers as an
option, that the buses came from the factory with a driver's side mirror
only.A option and accesories list for a mid 60-s bus I saw had the
elephant ears listed as dealer installed option. I have a 63/64 owners
manual that shows many buses with only the D/S round mirror. Severl
advertisements I have for 62, 62, 65, 67 buses of various body styles
shows only D/S round mirrors.

I know that WCM sells an elephant ear mirror they claim to be identicle
to the original dealer installed mirror, while the one that WW sells is
a Jasco, made in New Jersy, and slightly different.

A side point. I was looking at the schofield page Ronnie W supplied,
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page18.htm and it has round mirrors and
arms for only a few quid. ( what that is in 'merican money you'll have
to ask someone else).

So I guess that doesn't settle anything, but I hate to be definitive.
