I'm sitting here eating my frosted flakes in front of the computer this
morning and I darn near spit milk and flakes all over the monitor when I
started reading these posts.  The subject alone made me giggle but to sit
here and watch Thom and you guys go back and forth on this topic really
makes my day.  It's funny because both sides appear to be extrememly adept
at formulating quick and hilarious replies.  HAHAHAHA  Thanks for the
laugh!!!
