Speaking of this, is there an easy way to tell if you have a later (non bay) front end?  My 62 has a big nut rear, but I'm not sure if they changed the front end.  The front end has a sway bar, but I remember putting &quot;62&quot; brake shoes on it when I changed them all.  Can you fit up a sway bar to a earlier front end?  

Thanks.

Also, I never put the big brakes on the rear without replacing the front 
beam, which gives you the bigger front brakes and the sway bar.  And then,
