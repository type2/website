Well, I've narrowed my area down to the West San Fernando Valley (near Winnetka) Southern CA.  Anyone in this area(Greg)know what dealers were around in 1962?  The 2nd owner of the truck told me it lived there all its life till he bought it in '72

&gt;Steve, yes all of the VW Birth Certificates I've seen list the destination 
&gt;dealer.  (or at least the destination city and country).

Ah, there's a big difference between destination city/country and the 
actual dealership!  I would love to know exactly what dealership my Bus was 
sold from, but the closest I can get is finding a Dealers and Distributors 
booklet from that era and seeing what states my port-of-entry covered.  My 
'63 came into Jacksonville and was possibly sold in Florida, Georgia, or 
South Carolina.  &lt;shrugs&gt;  Beyond that is anyone's guess.
