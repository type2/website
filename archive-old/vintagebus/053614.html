Subject: headlight bucket rebuilding

not sure abour the metal piece, but as for that plastic/rubber piece that
disintegrates upon touching(kind of like in a sci-fi novel) anyway i just
went to the my FLAPS and showed them a scrap of it and asked for the rubber
hose that was closest in size....they cut a little chunk for me and it
works. is it perfect no, but it works
