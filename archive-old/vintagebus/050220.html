Subject: Rear Wheel Well lip on a '59

The wheel wells were cut out of my '59 Kombi by some DSPO. Rather than
hacking up a donor, I'm gonna fabricate them myself. I've actually already
done 75% of it. I had planned on taking the replacement panels somewhere
locally &amp; having the 1/4 (or is it 1/2 inch?) inward lip pressed into
place. But after looking at it in comparison to my '62, I've come to
realize, if it (the inward lip) wasn't there you wouldn't notice it. Is
there any reason for this lip to be there other than cosmetics? I'm
thinking that that'd leave me that much more room in the rear for tire
width. The bus will never be a &quot;perfect&quot; bus. I'm just making it a nice
daily driver. So as for it all being exactly stock perfect, I'm not
interested. They're already gone, so what I'm proposing to do would make it
&quot;look&quot; right. I just was wondering. Any input appreciated.
