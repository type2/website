&lt;&lt; I'm looking at a 1959 Double Cab, and I'm curious as 
to how practical some changes could be.  My goal is to 
make it daily driver suitable without  making it impossible

changes are mostly bolt-on and can be reversed: &gt;&gt;

OK- I'm going to guess and say that you will update to a 
later motor and go with a tunnel type transaxle.  Saving
the orginals for later restoration or whatever

&lt;&lt;   1) Tranny top speed and how practical it would be to 
swap tranny out with higher top speed gears (Todd Hill in 
Olympia). &gt;&gt;

Top speed now?  With the orginal gearing I'd say 50 +/-
with a 36hp but I'm sure some of us out here may have a
better idea.  Depends on how quickly you can stop from 
that speed with the teeny brakes that the early splits 
came with.  You could judge your top speed from that.  

Also, check out: www.volkswagen_dot_org/tiresize.htm.  Input 
your data, remember the final drive ratio is the ring and 
pinion times the redux box ratio (see below).  The stock 
Type2s came with a .82 4th vs. the .89 of the other VWs.  
Ring and pinion ratios that will work with the tunnel type 
transaxle include the 4.375, 4.125, and 3.875 from VW.  
There is an aftermarket 3.44 Type1 style r/p out there but 
I have not seen one yet.  

&lt;&lt; 1a) Redux boxes -- what years are interchangeable? 
 What would bolt on to a '59?&gt;&gt;

Just about all except for the Barndoor style I guess.  
If you went with the larger braked '64-'67 style then you 
should also think seriously about changing the rest of 
the system to match.  For straight ahead boltonability 
(a Claraism!) then up to '63.  Split case transaxle parts 
(what the '59 came with orginally) are getting scarce 
and very expensive.  The later tunnel type of the '60 on
 is still readily available and fairly reasonable in  cost 
and options.  The tunnel type will bolt in place of the 
split case (there are a few changes but nothing big) 
and the stock redux axles should go right on as well.  
There were several options as to redux box ratios but 
the most common is the 1.39 of the 'small nut/ non-
Barndoor' variety.  We should find someone who has 
done this swap and have them walk you through it as 
my experience here is just rebuilding the gearboxes 
and not actually installing or swapping stuff around.  

&lt;&lt;   2) Anything unusual in putting a 1600DP bug 
engine in this? &gt;&gt;

None that I am aware of- anyone else?

&lt;&lt;  Is it frowned  upon to have to enlarge the 6v tranny 
to accept a 200 flywheel? &gt;&gt;

I do it all the time- no problemo.  The actual clearancing
is very small and with an air grinder I can have a nice 
finish in about 15-20 minutes.  Be sure to install the 
adapter starter bushing for a 6v trans with a 12v starter.

That's my 2 cents- anyone else got a better idea???
