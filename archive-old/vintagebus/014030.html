OOPS. i guess my question seems a little simple. what i meant to ask was; 
this primer would have to be sanded, correct? or is there a type that can be 
painted directly if the surfaces were acceptable. i plan to paint my bug 
first so i can learn from experience how to do the bus right.
also is there a way to re-bend the channel for the e_dot_comp. seal without 
screwing up the new paint? maybe these channels were never meant to be bent?
TIA
zac
hey Thom how is the 54' coming?
