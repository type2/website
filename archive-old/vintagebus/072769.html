Subject: Re: [VB] popouts on a dc

Yeah, Clara's right (as usual).  My '61 DC has the
early latches because the popout's different, so I
would assume Don's is the same.  HOWEVER, if you
replaced the popout AND the latch it might work.

&gt;   I never had a DC (early or late) but heard that if
&gt; you use a later frame 
&gt; &amp;latch it one that came with the early version, the
&gt; window won't open/close 
&gt; properly (JP?)   I think 60 DCs might have the early
