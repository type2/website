The stuff Andrew makes is nice, although not of the correct material.
His cutting is impeccable - very, very accurate.  I talked to him _at_ the
'rama, and it sounds like he's getting out of the biz.  He's making a set
of panels for my panel right now.

&gt; What about that guy Andrew from out in your area Thom? I see him at every Bug O

&gt; I think he may only do the panels for Commercials (painted grey) but that's the
&gt; only Type of Bus worth owning anyway...................................
