Subject: 66 6Volt Horn and Solenoid questions

I am moving at turtles pace to get my 66 camper road worthy.  Friday I
installed a 6V WR1 kit no problem, started right up, Whoo Hoo!  That was
short lived, drove home and no start, referred to Muir and followed all of
his instructions and it appears that the starter is fine and the solenoid is
crusty, stuck, or near shot but I can bypass for now.  Yes I am a non purist
for now! Anyone know if I can get a 6V solenoid w/out the starter or should
I pull and take to a rebuilder? So after I figured out that problem I tested
my Horn and it seems that my problem is the button portion, grounded makes
it go Oogh Gaa!  Tried getting rid of the corrosion w/sand paper and a screw
driver.  No go.  I was thinking about taking a small piece of sheet metal or
a washer and super glueing it to the corroded area in hopes of getting it to
work.  Viable Solution or am I a freak? Still need to do the brakes, they do
work but not that great and in my 3 or 4, 5 mile trips it seems that some
maggot see's me coming and says hey that car is old I better pull out in
front of him. I know I need to do the brakes and the horn. Later fix the
speedo, tune up and and figure out why the steering is tight.  Will
hopefully have pictures on the web by early next week!   Oh yeah and will
have to do a ton of body work!

Hey what do you think of the name &quot;Tippy&quot; for my bus, like Tippy the Turtle?
