Subject: Transmission whining

Last Friday I drove a number of highway miles in my '64 bus.  After the
drive, it seems like my transmission is whining louder than before.  In
the past, it seemed like the whining was mostly in 2nd gear, and would
go away in 3rd, 4th.  Now, it seems to be consistent in all gears.  The
transmission otherwise works great, with no popping out of gears (1st
gear syncro is shot).   Clutch is fairly new &amp; engine runs great.   I
changed my transmission oil about 5K miles ago, and topped it off about
2K miles ago. Does anyone have any idea what may have changed, and
whether it is cause for concern?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim
