Cause Judson sucks! ;-)
Seriously, they weren't the most reliable hotrod kits.
Do you have a complete set of engine tin? Plates above the pushrod tubes, are 
you're engine compartment seals fresh?
You might try changing the exhaust with a header system, that would help.

Greg

&lt;&lt;I own a '57 type 2 standard that has a Judson supercharger installed by the 
dealer in Rochester,NY in 1958. Why does my engine run so hot??? I am 
assuming that the dealer installed the correct fuel pump diaphram spring and 
the correct air correction jet for the carb. What other mods can I do to make 
the engine ru a little cooler?
