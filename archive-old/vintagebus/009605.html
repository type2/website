Recently I was shown what I could see to be a copy of a Bosch plug.  It was
kind of chrome plated with a very sleazy looking ground electrode.  The
electrode was kind of squished off at the end and bent etc.  It felt lighter
than a real Bosch.  It was boxed in a Bosch box that said Made in Germany on
it.  The number was wrong though.  It was like a W22d or something on the
box.  I could see the ground electrode breaking off in my cylinders before
long.  I hope this is not the shape of things to come.  Has anybody else
seen these things?  Definitely be very careful buying plugs nowdays.  I know
Bosch didn't make these things.

John
