If I am not mistaking ,,, VW dipped earlier model vws . As time went by they
stoped doing that and just painted. Thats why so many late model VWs rust
out so bad

&gt;You Insist that:
&gt;&gt;The problem again is that there is no primer or paint under those
&gt;&gt;supports
&gt;&gt;that are welded to keep the sheet metal from flexing.  Unlike the type 1s
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;were dipped completely in a high zinc content primer the buses were
&gt;&gt;sprayed
&gt;
&gt;But are you SURE of this. Havent you ever seen the VW ad that shows a bus
&gt;being dipped and states that this is why they are more rust resistant?
&gt;Maybe someone remembers where that ad is, for shame I don't.
