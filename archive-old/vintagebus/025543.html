Yes, I'm still on the wrong side of the water for BC, but I'm due to fly
out from Manchester this afternoon at 4:00GMT, with T2 Parts book in
hand and some pfennig's to spend.

So BC goers, if you're still reading your email and you need to identify
that &quot;hard to identify&quot; part
look out for me on Saturday - I'll be in an Opel Corsa with
&quot;vintagebus_dot_com&quot; posters in the window
(I presume you don't mind me flying the flag Thom?).

Just as a teeser, anyone know what a  211 941 205 A   is ......

Lee.
