There are ways around the right click block such as viewing the source to
see where the image is stored.  I suppose there might be other, more
advanced, ways to hide that though.

3rd,   Any site designer has the ability to keep a viewer from copying an
image. There is a right click disabler that makes the viewer unable to copy
an image. This is a viable option to a designer who doesn't want to have an
image &quot;pilfered&quot; rather than marking the image with a &quot;tag&quot; .
