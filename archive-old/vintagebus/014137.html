I have a problem when I step on the brakes or turn on the signal the only 
thing that happens is the direction indicator in the speedo lights up. No 
external brake lights or flashers. The fuses are OK, I have a new battery  
and I installed a new flasher relay but that didn't help. Anyone had this 
before?
