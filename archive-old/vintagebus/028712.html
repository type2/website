Apologies for yet another tire question, but
you listies are the only people to ask.


I went through the tire issue with my baywindow a
few years back.  Never did find a source for a 
light truck tire in that size, and got extremely
tired of supposedly professional tire shop guys
telling me that passenger tires were fine.  

I seem to be facing the issue again, but this time 
for a '62 with 15&quot; rims.

An archive search gives me lots of info about 14&quot;,
but little about 15&quot;.  

I'm looking for a definitive answer on what LT tires
I should put on my van.  Hopefully for under $80 per 
tire.    A tire I can use on a daily driver in Phoenix,
that I won't have to change to drive to the Northwest 
once or twice a year.

Why is this such a hard question?

Damned if I can find either a set of LT215/75R-15's
or LT205/75R-15's  anywhere, for any price.   And
I don't even know if those are what I want.  It's
frustrating because I've been dealing with exactly 
this issue for years, and I don't know much more 
than when I started.  It's doubly frustrating because
I always end up compromising and getting passenger 
tires.  Triply frustrating when you go into 10 tire 
shops and ask for truck tires in our size and all you
get is blank stares, or an argument that you don't 
want what you've just asked for.



Regards,

James
