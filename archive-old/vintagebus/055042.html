Subject: Re: [VB] Need an AJ case

I hate to keep referring back to my &quot;builder&quot; (I am not equipped with the
tools or skills to build an engine yet), but he says that the new cases are
&quot;soft&quot; and that an old german case will deliver 10 more horses than any Mex
or Brazilian.

I am willing and able to buy a new case, but the quest, right or wrong, is
to find a good AJ. That is why I put it to this group. Is my builder
correct? Full of it?

&gt; Hey Denis,
&gt; My opinion is if you are going to build up a stroker etc., just get a new
&gt; case.  $350 or so I know, but then you have a good strong case you know
&gt; hasn't been overheated etc.  I would build a stock 1600 with a used case,
&gt; but you are already going to be putting a lot of money in parts.
&gt; BTW as I understand it they are no longer producing 88s.  I just built a
&gt; 69X88 SP.  A lot of guys around here have been building 74X88 and been
&gt; happy with them.  You don't have to run short stroker pistons with them.
&gt; I have a Berg 78X90.5 in my 67 and have never liked they idea of the short
&gt; piston skirts.  Also I have had great troubles with Engle cams, so keep
&gt; that in mind.
