Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

Look at custom wheels that are coated and those are the exact areas that 
you will see no coating on and usually the marks of it have been 
polished off of those areas.
The same for rims that come clear coated.

&gt;&gt;&gt; From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:
&gt;&gt; &quot;...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left 
&gt;&gt; wheel came off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the 
&gt;&gt; powdercoating
&gt;&gt;  on the wheels caused the lug bolt to lose torque some 4000 miles 
&gt;&gt; after the wheels lug bolts had been properly torqued on.

&gt; Tragic!.... SOmething I was told before I put the wheels on my 
&gt; vehicles,,,
&gt;
&gt; BEFORE putting freshly painted rims on a vehicle,, REMOVE THE PAINT on 
&gt; the back of the rim where it contacts the brake part,, and from the 
&gt; taper area on the front, where the nut/bolt tightens on,,
&gt; This is just a small circle area
