Subject: Front brake drum seal problem, etc.

Greetings, All...
    I received my new front brake drums(yea!) for my 65 and
proceeded to clean them up(yea!) and install new bearings(yea!).
Got the bearing races installed(yea!) and then went to test fit the
seal. The seal just dropped in...(boo!). 
   OK...the drums are Frum units, #1346E, =VW#211.405.615E.
The seals are Sabo 01711-BRG, and are supposed to be = VW#
211.405.641B.(I believe they are correct for that year VW bus
because the new seal will fit my old drums fine).
   The the new drum seal bore is 1 or 2mm. larger than the old VW
original drums.
   Has anyone run into this problem and, if so, how did you correct it?

   Also, does anyone make a reproduction of the tiny clip on the rear
brakes that hold the crossbar to the lower spring?  I am missing one
on my left rear brake. 
Thanks!
