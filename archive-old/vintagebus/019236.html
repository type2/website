Kinda of like the big financial firms do in the stock market;
buy several huge blocks of shares, driving up the price, then
dumping the shares at the higher price to unsuspecting investors
who see the &quot;bait&quot; and buy thinking they're onto something.

OTOH - do we have proof that these cars actually *left*?  That would
be THE scam!  Maybe there's a huge warehouse in SoCal with all these
buses that supposedly went to Japan.  They could &quot;bring them back&quot;
onesy-twosey and make a killing and saving on the shipping costs!

&gt; The Japanese are doing to the BUS market the same they did to the PORSCHE

&gt; then when the prices inflated and people were paying it.Today you would be
&gt; lucky to get half of that for the car. Look at the bus resto's of today,
&gt; 30,000 plus to do a Deluxe, 6,000 dollars for a restorable beater. The end
&gt; is near as now that the prices have peaked and/or are peaking and the world
&gt; economy is on a downslide, a lot of the overseas buses will find there way
&gt; back to our Sunny Shores to be resold at the artificially overseas buyer
