Subject: Latter Day Gearshift Linkage

I've torn into my shift linkage, with the lofty goal of precision shifting
(more realistically defined as &quot;reliably finding the gear I'm seeking&quot;). My
'67 has the later-design front shift rod, the front of which rests on a
body-mounted metal dowel. In cleaning the front rod up to remove and replace
the nylon bushing that sits in the front of the rod and slides on the metal
dowel, I noticed that the hemispherical recess in the top of the rod (where
the ball end of the shift lever goes) has a hole in the bottom. It's about
0.125&quot; wide and nearly 0.250&quot; long, and I could see the back end of the
bushing when peering down into it.

Is this normal, or has the front rod been worn down by years of gearshift
thrashing? Does anyone remember, short of unbolting your shift lever? I'd
like to know if I should be replacing the front rod. Any help appreciated...
