Even with postage, I think it's worth it.  The CE safaris at least attempt
to look original; the wolfgang ones don't.  Having personally had both,
I'm gonna have to come down on the side of CE, unless someone can convince
me the quality of the Wolfgang/busboys units have somehow miraculously
improved.  Izzy's would have been a good stateside option, but he appears
to be MIA.

&gt; Just noticed that Creative also sells pop-out window frames.  I was just
&gt; about to order a set of 6 from Wolfgang - any one have recommendations
&gt; either way?

I tried the wolfgang popouts, and ended up sending them back.  The channel
profile was correct, but the radiusing of the corners was not only different
than the originals, but each corner was different.  I haven't seen the CE
popouts yet.
