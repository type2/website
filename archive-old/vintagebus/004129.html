Subject: Re: [VB] Emblem Clips?

On the subject......... I went to ACE Hardware the other day to pick-up some
bolts and nuts for my 65 and discovered that they stock clips that almost
exactly resemble the original clips I took off my Bus. You'd have to bring
your emblem with though since they have like four different sizes of these.
Cheap, $0.39 each.

&gt; &gt; I have a new emblem for my 55', actually the only emblem I have every
had
&gt; &gt; for it, and need to know how to make it stay on.  From what I understand
&gt; &gt; there are clips for the back, however I have never seen any and am
wondering
&gt; &gt; what to us.  Is this something that you can purchase from Bus Boys, or
&gt; &gt; Ronnie?  Or, can I just get them from a hardware store?  Thanks in
advance.
