Hi Ncbus,
Check your compression!  If it it fine you probably have the oil ring/s on 
the right side downward and possibly the compression ring/s gap/s in line 
with the oil ring/s.  If your compression is low in one cylinder and comes 
after squiting in a teaspoon or so of oil in it through the spark plug hole 
you might have a worn out ring/s or broken ring/s.   Eric&amp;Barb
