Subject: VW Time Warp on &quot;The 70's&quot;

Hey everybody:

Did anybody else watch &quot;The 70's&quot; on NBC the other night? I did.

I addition to following the story I kept an eye out for the VWs that 
appeared in the 2 part movie. Several VWs appeared but many were cars of the 
future. For example:

The Kent State incident of May of 1970. A white 1974 Bug was in the parking 
lot. The next day one of the charactors drives to her parents house in a 
1971 or 1972 Convertible.

Standing outside a movie theater in 1972, a 1978 or 1979 covertible is 
parked behind two people who are talking to each other.

Other VWs that appeared in the movie were an early Bus, a really nice Type 3 
Ghia and a Thing.

Maybe I have too much time on my hands to notice this stuff.
