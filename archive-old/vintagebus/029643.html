Subject: Big nut/small nut mismatch

Hello, list.

I've had my (first a-c VW) '65 camper (EZ?  Dunno yet) for about a month
now.  While checking my brakes, I have now discovered that the right
side rear axle nut is 36mm but the left side is 46mm.  I tore open the
right side reduction box because the bearings are going south and have
since then done some reading on the fine Type2_dot_com website and have
realized I may be in a bind here.

It seems that if the gears are different in one side compared to
another, my tranny will be wearing unevenly.  Is this correct?  Sort of
like a left turn that is lasting for thousand of miles...  It seems the
logical choice is instead of bothering to replace those bearings in the
right side, what I need to do is find a 46mm nut box with associated
axle and gears.

What can I salvage here?  Are the two actual box cases incompatible?
That inboard half of the box looks to be a real pill to remove... The
upper gear is 19 teeth, approximately 7.5mm across inbetween a 6306 and
a 6305 bearing.  The lower gear is 24 teeth and approximately 9.5mm
across inbetween two 6306 bearings.  The gears look to be in good
shape.  I have left the 46mm side alone for now since the bearings seem
good.

I wish my first question could have been a little more fun!  I would
like to add that thanks to the list's notice, I did get one of those
Wal-Mart toys for my 5 year old for Christmas.  Gosh, I can't wait!!
It's for him... really!

Many thanks in advance.
