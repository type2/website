&lt;&lt; how do we check which exchangers we have, the cooling
 fins are inside the external coverings???? not visible &gt;&gt;
Hi P&amp;C,
Remove rear bumper, apron, rear engine tin enough to also remove the muffler. 
 Then carefully peer up the rear ends of the heat exchangers to see if you 
have internal fins inside about 3-4&quot;.  You will see this best with a 
flashlight held up against the side of your head so the beam of the 
flashlight and your vision of one eye are as parallel as possible.  This all 
is best viewed after dark once your eyes are accustomed.  During daylight you 
really have to have the sun over your shoulder and at just the right angle to 
see in there properly.  Which is only easy to arrange if the heat exchangers 
are off the engine!
