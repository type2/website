I'm wondering what this feels like. I've started to notice something like a shudder when I shut the bus off. It's in the second after the key is turned off. I have no clue what this is, but I don't think it's normal in any way. My mind's eye says to think about that flywheel, but I kinda don't think that's it. Don't feel anything abnormal with the bus running.

Any ideas?
