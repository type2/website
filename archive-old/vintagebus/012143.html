Subject: re: pop-out window in closet
Mime-Version: 1.0

Wel today I had some time to drill out the two screw holding the window to the hinge. Not as hard as I thought. The first one went beautifully, I hit it right on center, and I guess it releived the tension in the screw enough, so that I could just uhnscre it then with a screwdriver, damn I was blessed :).

The second one was a little tougher, I had to drill it twice, increasing the drill bit size on the second run.

Now I have the window out, and I need to take the metal frame apart, I believe, to get the new gasket in.  Now these two screws seem to be stuck I have tried the liquid wrench, and think I may need to drill these out as well, I am definitly a bit more nervous as I only have two screws holding the frame together, not much room for error.

wish me luck and thanks for the advice on drilling out the previous screws.
