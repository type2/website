Subject: fender flares as an accessory?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.0004202352490.28274-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


I was just out looking close at the fender flairs on my '57 bus and
happened to notice that they are the exact shape as the original doglegs
and that no cutting was to done to attach the front flares.  Whoever did
the job must have just molded them right over the existing
wheel-well.  And cutting was done to the rear since all four flares are
the same.

Anyway, my question is...does anyone have any knowledge of EMPI or some
other old aftermarket company making fender flares to fit onto the
existing doglegs?  If you want to see some pics of the bus go to:
