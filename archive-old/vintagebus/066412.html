You should tell your dad to look for buses there. I got two of the most rust
free cleanest buses I have ever owned from that area, A 1960 SC and 1960 DC
(which I still have)

FWIW, I talked with my father-in-law down in Borrego Springs night before 
last.  They were having their first rain in three years.  There actually 
might be wildflowers next spring. (If it keeps raining...) ;o) The drought 
has been so severe in the southern desert that his fifty year old cactii 
(suguaro) have died.

&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; Do both routes!  One on the way out, and the other on the way back.  Make 
&gt; sure to check out Meteor Crater, Carlsbad Cavern, plus the museum in Boron
CA 
&gt; near Edwards AFB, and we have heard that seeing the VLA (As everyone has
seen 
&gt; in the movie &quot;Contact&quot;) is worth it on your desert route.  Late spring
after 
&gt; the rains turn loose the green and flowers and before the seasonal weather

&gt; heats up is the best time for either/both routes.
