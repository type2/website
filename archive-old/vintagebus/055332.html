Subject: RE: Sump

Dave writ:
&quot;The dry sump feature and it's evolution allowed Porsche to eliminate the
drain plug bolt , at least for a while. The 3.0 engine case from 1978 to
1983 had no drain plug. Dave \X/ &quot;

Actually mine has a drain plug, 1979, and it is necessary to drain the
crankcase oil as well as the oil tank.  Usually 3-4 quarts come out of the
case and then the other 8ish quarts out of the tank.  On an oil change it
takes 11.5-12 quarts to refill it.


Take Care,
