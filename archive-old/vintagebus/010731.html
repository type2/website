Subject: steering dampner?

Have you checked your steering dampner lately?  Do you know what shape it is 
in?    

I was have little steering shakies in my 61 and took a look around under 
there- I had put new shocks on in April, but never touched the steering 
dampner- in the 7 years I have had the bus-  and the rubber bushing had sort 
of fallen out of one end.  Putting a new one on there made it nicer to drive. 
 Two easy bolts.

looked for a date code on the old one, but could not find it.  It did not 
smooth smoothly like the new one, there were &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;crunchy&quot; spots.  
Had a VW p/n and was Boge. the beam is a 64/65 one the PO had installed- but 
perhaps that piece was 35 years old.
