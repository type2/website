Subject: re:drill bits for metal

has nayone ever tried one of those drill sharpening tools. you stick the
drill bit in and supposedly it sharpens it.

anyway here is soem info re:drill bits-

referring to my mcmaster book(see mcmaster_dot_com) about drill bits:

heavy duty cobalt steel is good, should be recognized by straw gold color.

a better one would be carbide or carbide tipped-but mcmaster seems to
suggest these are best for drill presses-as the bits are&quot;extremely rigid&quot;
but you dont want any spindle vibration or end play.

as for surface treatments/coatings:

TiN(titanium nitride) bright gold in color, use on non ferrous and ferrous
metlas. must increase machining speeds by 25-30% compared to non coated. do
not use on wrought aluminum or titanium alloys

TiCN(titanium carbonitride) violet gray or gun metal gray or blue in color.
for tough to machine steels, ductile cast iron, cast aluminum, stainless
steels, high temp alloys, copper alloys, and titanium. increase machine
speed 35-50% as compared to non coated.

TiALN (titanium aluminum nitride) dark violet/blue gray in color. for
drilling stainless steel, high alloy carbon steel, nickel based high temp
alloys and titanium alloys. highly effective for abrasive materials such as
cast iron and it high heat resistance may permit dry machining. increase
machining speeds 75-100%

their site may have mnore info-this is form the catalog i have which is two
years old.
