Subject: Re: [VB] Aluminum block

Ronnie,

I am not saying the aluminum cases are a bad idea. I am simply saying that
they are not 'perfect' out of the box, and it is not uncommon to need some
work done to them to get them ready for a build.

I am well aware of how many aluminum cases are being used, and all the ones
I know of, have needed some work done before they were put together, and I'm
not
talking about boreing them out, or clearancing for stroke.

I think they're great once they're cleaned up, but as you've seen for
yourself, the cases do need some work before using them. (with the exception
of possibly the latest runs of them).
