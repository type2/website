Subject: Jerome report/long part 1

   It all started one week before Jerome with me deciding that I need to
take my 63 flip seat along with the DD swap bus. All went well with bringing
the bus in the shop on a Saturday and driving it home on Monday, trans swap
all the brakes etc. All said and done it took the rest of the week to
install the rest of the junk. Planned on leaving Thursday morning, but with
2 buses to pack and get ready we didn't leave till Thursday afternoon. 
   The trip started out great till my bus started to ping leaving Havasu, no
problem, pulled over and retarded the timing. Ran great from then on (1776
single port). We all stopped  (Steve in my DD, Britt in the ROAD COW, Me in
the 63 and Kenny in the unknown 67 deluxe he bought 2 days previous) at the
gas station before heading on the freeway it happened. Kennys wiring fried
at the ignition switch, no problem, a little electrical tape and we were
ready to go. Well all went well for a while till Kennys fried more wires
(fixed that) then he did it again (fixed that)
  We finally hit our destination in Seligman, Az to hook up with VW Howard
and camp on his 5 acres there, it was dark, none of us read the map right so
off we went in the dark wilderness of the Seligman
outback. We cruised done some dirt roads took a left on some more and
continued on. 
  I was leading and went down a steep hill and through a huge mud hole/river
bed. I made it through OK and continued on. Soon there were no lights behind
me so I decided to turn around at what looked like a flat spot on the bottom
of a hill. I proceeded down the hill to the flat spot and made my U-turn.
Little did I know (it was pitch black) that I was in a muddy river bed,
proceeded to get the bus buried in mud but didn't let that stop me from
trying to get out. My 9 year old boy was panicked as I told him not to worry
(ya right) as I open the door and saw mud to the bottom of the bus. I
powered out in 1st, back to reverse and forward at least 40 times more till
I dug my own path and powered out. 
  Now that this excitement was over I returned back down the road to see
where the others were out and saw that my DD pulling the one wheel trailer
also got stuck in the mud hole I went through the first time. The ever
famous road cow pulled him out with his dogs leash?
  All said and done we finally got VW Howard on the cell and made him come
and meet us back where we got off the freeway to guide us to his land. He
showed up and off we went. The roads to his land were much nicer then the
wrong turn roads we were just on. Set up camp, cooked and slept.
  We all got up in the morning, packed up and headed out. This time with 6
buses. Vw Howard in the Safari (56?) bus and cousin Willie in his bay. We
headed down the road with a stop for gas, ice and there things we felt we
needed and headed out again.
  We reached the Ashfork turn-off and hooked up with Bryant (from Kansas)
and Steve from Colorado. This now made 8 buses. We all proceeded on and
headed down the road till we made the turn onto another dirt road and the
back way into Jerome. This was an awesome drive with eight BUSES, dust
flying, etc. This is a real shortcut to get to Jerome, cuts off 70 or so
miles and no STEEP hills to climb or ascend. We all made it to a group of
CHEERS and pic takers as we rolled down the hill into the GOLD HILL MINE
home of the Jerome Jamboree.
