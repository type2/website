The repro clips suck.  You gotta bend 'em a little to help keep the 
cap clipped.   The repro hubcaps don't help, either, as the lip isn't quite
the same shape as the original.  I was going thru one or two hubcaps a week
until I got it straigtened out.

This is a trail and error procedure.  If you can remove the hubcap by hand,
ie without the little tool or a screwdriver, it will come off  on the road.

&gt; I own a 67 21DLX with '14 rims. The clips on one of my rear rims was not
&gt; holding the hub cap properly so that that it would &quot;throw&quot; the cap at speed
&gt; at the slightest bump in the road. I bought some clips which seemed much
&gt; stronger that the originals, however, when I riveted them on, the new clips
&gt; would not hold the cap in place at all and would &quot;pop&quot; the cap right back at
&gt; me, not holding the cap at all.
