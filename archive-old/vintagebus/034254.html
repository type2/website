Another post attempt at 1:00pm Wednesday.

Welcome to the &quot;Unwelcome tech talk about Transaxles&quot;,

Another reference!  I know how the lists in general feel about &quot;VW Mags&quot;, as
Bob Hoover dissed them at will :)  Yet there are &quot;accidents&quot; where I think a
some real information sneaks out.

The July 1997 Issue of _VW Trends_.  On page 20, &quot;Tech Procedure:  Building
a Better Box (Transaxle)&quot;.  This article is 4 pages in length and features
Rancho Performance Transaxles in Anaheim, CA.

By all customer accounts I have researched, Rancho seems to know their
stuff, which is exceptional for a mass rebulder of anything.  General
consensus seems to be that they are better than Transform on Type2 gearbox
quality.  I don't say this lightly, as I also have a lot of my OWN PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE to contribute, this isn't just some newbie taking &quot;VW Trends&quot; or
&quot;big boys at Rancho&quot; as gospel.

Yet almost every single nugget out of this article rings true to my
experience.  I have both 1.39 and 1.25 redux box Type2's, I've previously
changed transaxle to 3.88 [different Type2], and I own what I have found to
be the only mentioned 3.44 R&amp;P Type2 transaxle :)  I have DONE MY BEST to
validate what I read.

Anyway, the key things I gleaned:

   -- Page 21 picture #7 shows two Ring &amp; Pinion gears.  The caption says
&quot;For this application, Rancho used a taller ring and pinion gear set.  The
stock transmission [article previously indicates 1966 Type 2] came with
4.37:1 ratio.  Rancho fitted a 3.88:1 ratio ring and pinion.&quot;

OK, there is some real-world experience that 4.37 was used in '66.  That is
exactly what I found in Ronnie's transaxle that is out of a low-mileage '66
Westy that he believes was never opened.  Now the article does NOT mention
4th gear, but my measurement on Ronnie's transaxle is a .82 4th which yields
(based on my own unvalidated calculations) 3945RPM at 65MPH with stock
185R14 metric rear tires.

As an aside, Ronnie is getting both a temp gauge and a tachometer (RPM
gauge) to assist me.  We can then use my GPS to validate these numbers (I
may even talk Ronnie into putting my 185R14 tires on rear for our test).

  -- The same Page 21 picture #7 caption then goes on to say &quot;[3.88:1] This
ratio isn't quite a highway cruising gear, but it is much better than stock
[4.37:1].&quot;

WOW... VALIDATION of what all this has been about to me in the last two
weeks.  All my calculations and so forth have lead me to believe that 3.88
is better, but still not enough!  I was reaching the conclusion that 3.44 is
actually what I want for 65 to 70 MPH highway cruising on long trips.. but
every time I mention 3.44 to someone, they go &quot;man, that is way too drastic
a change.&quot;

So I think I'm nearing the end of my research and experiments.  I will use
Ronnie's tachometer to validate his bus as another reference, but I believe
I already know what the results will be.

SO I'm going to go with a 3.44 R&amp;P transaxle, which I conveniently have
sitting here :)  I was pretty close to ordering up a 3.88 out of fear for
finding my bus wouldn't be able to go past 20 MPH :) But no more... I'm
going to give the 3.44 a go. DISCLAIMER TIME:

   -- I have actual experience with upgrades to a 3.88, I went through that
13 months ago in my 1963 Double Cab. I know what the real-world is like, I'm
not a complete idiot.
   -- I am running 185R14 tires, which are PRETTY SMALL compared to what I
have observed (on list, list archives, and at shows) most people run. THIS
IS DELIBERATE.  If I had 205 or 215 tires, I would NOT go with the 3.44.  I
want the 185R14 tires because that way I can put snow chains on the rear
(where they are required on mountain passes in Oregon and Washington state)
and NOT destroy my body metal.
   -- I clearly understand that going to a 3.44 will clearly impact
acceleration in ALL 4 gears.  Which means off the line it will be tough to
get going... and slow getting up to cruise.
   -- I am fully aware of the concerns over &quot;lower fan speed but same MPH&quot;
and overheating debate.  My real-world measurements and study have lead me
to believe that I am going in the right direction.  I may end up being
wrong, but I'm not going into this as an idiot.
   -- I have decided 100% against any options of removing redux boxes, as I
feel that this changes things I am not interested in changing.  I
acknowledge that this is another way to reach similar (highway cruising)
results, but not one I am considering at this time.
   -- I am running a 1600cc Dual Port engine and will be switching to dual
Kadron 40mm carburetors.  I am also considering ratio rockers, but not yet
decided.
   -- I am not concerned with braking, as panic stops at over 50MPH aren't
good :)  Yes, higher speed is more danger, but I also think going slower
than traffic on the interstate presents a higher danger.  Less of two evils.
I have no intention of going beyond 70MPH, even for passing (haha, passing).

But I also see one really nice factor.  Because I am changing the entire R&amp;P
and not just 4th gear, my 3rd gear will be closer to what my 4th gear is
now.  In 3rd, I should be able to go up to at least 55MPH and still be under
4000RPM (right now I am at 47MPH in 3rd at 4000RPM).  This means I really
won't be doing anything different than what I do today on climbing
mountains, just in a different gear.  I may actually be able to do a little
better!

My desire is HIGHWAY cruising, that may not be your desire, but that is
mine.  I say that again, as I'm sure there are people out there who think
I'm crazy.. making acceleration slower :)  My believe is that gains will be
gas mileage, engine life (with close attention to cooling), less noise, and
the ability to go at 67MPH all day...

Thanks to those who have helped.  As always, more information is better...
pass along anything you may have.

Eric and I had a chat today where he referenced his &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; 1966
book and he found references to a 4.43 R&amp;P gear.  It also didn't say which
years they used .89 and .82 4th...

Well, this pretty much blows away any ability to be SURE what you have by
turning the crank and counting wheel turns.  4.375 - 4.43 - 4.57 are all so
close on the R&amp;P that you can't be sure.  I have the latest numbers up at:

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/tech/Trans/T2/

I would really like any input on what we think the original 1966 / 1967
Westy came with in terms of R&amp;P and 4th gear.  So far .82 and 4.375 is
current assumption, but I have only tested 2 VW's!  And I could be making
mistakes on the test (don't think so, but...)

My desire is to combine the R&amp;P and 4th gear numbers to validate the 4040RPM
at 65MPH figure that the 1963-1967 Bentley says....
