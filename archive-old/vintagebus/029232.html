Subject: Murder Investigation - Kristin Ann Laurite


Not sure how much of this is being cross-posted so some stuff you've
read may be re-stated:

A woman named Kristin Laurite who was traveling cross-country in a VW
Bus was murdered near an Interstate rest area near Conway, Arkansas this
weekend. From the following news story the implication is that this
happened Sunday the 27th but from talking to Charlie Ford I think it
actually happened on Saturday:

Ms. Laurite was traveling from the Northeast to California and she had a
printout of the AIRS roster in her van. If you are registered with AIRS
and you were on her route you may be getting a call from a police
agency. They are anxious to find anybody who might have talked with her
while she was traveling. From what I can tell they DO NOT suspect that
anybody on the AIRS list had anything to do with her death whatsoever.

I believe she was in Memphis on Saturday morning and a member of the
type2 list worked on her bus for her (he had posted to the type2 list
about her carburetor problems). She traveled west from there.

Again, there is NO REASON to believe that ANY of us did ANYTHING but
offer help to this young lady. I say that because the familiar &quot;Internet
implication snowball&quot; is beginning to roll downhill on at least one of
the mailing lists.

There is an Officer Keeling of the Conway Police Department who wants to
talk to anybody who may have spoken with Ms. Laurite. I don't have his
number but Charlie Ford does, I'll make sure it gets posted to all
appropriate fora if he doesn't. Laurite left a mother who is surely in
agony and Charlie is going to try to contact her and see if there is
anything we can do to help.
