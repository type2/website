Subject: Spring assemblies
Message-ID: &lt;19990401203011.21186.rocketmail_at_web104.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Are the spring assemblies used for the 'backs' of the 1/3
and 2/3 front seats on '63 and up Buses the same as the
spring assemblies used for the 'backs' of the full-length
middle seat?

Or, said another way:
If I unclamp the spring assemblies from a set of front
'split' seats, can I use them to complete a middle seat
where the spring assemblies are completely missing?

Anybody got some spring assemblies for the 'backs' of a
full-length middle seat?  Or a middle seat that is trashed
but has usable seat springs, i.e. one that a person in their
right mind would never buy, except for parts?

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
