&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; The blower that I installed was (i think) one of those
bilge-blowers that
&gt; people are talking about, installed towards the front of the long
heater tube
&gt; between the frame members.
&gt;My only problem with it was the irritating noise that it made when
&gt; operational. I'd prefer to have one that ran closer to &quot;whisper
quiet&quot;. I've
&gt; already considered mounting the blower closer to the rear of the
tube to help
&gt; alleviate the noise...
&gt;ideas and suggestions welcome. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt; Well the only problem with installing the blower farther back in the
heating
&gt; tubing is that the fan will experience more heat and could melt
down.  We have
&gt; thought of trying out the blower setup up front like you had, but
after
&gt; thinking about it have put it off due to the following reason.  The
problem is
&gt; that for all intents you are trying to have the heater system push
hot air
&gt; into the interior that with good seals should be like trying to blow
air into
&gt; a pop bottle with your mouth closed around the opening.  One way to
avoid the
&gt; pop bottle problem is to come up with a way to duct the cold air
under the
&gt; rear seat back into the engine compartment and engineer it so that
when you
&gt; had the heat off that the ducting automaticly closed a flap to seal
the two
&gt; compartments off from each other.  This system would probably not
need any
&gt; electrical fans since you would use the engine fan and help increase
it's
&gt; effectiveness by removing most if not all of the backpressure.  

Why not take this one step further and make the heating system
recirculating?  Run a duct from the back of the passenger compartment
into the engine bay.  Connect this duct to an electric fan and the
output from the fan to the heat exchangers.

This way, the exchangers get already-warmed air from the passenger
compartment, rather than having to heat cold outside air.

The intake for the fan could be located behind the spare tire, where
it is out of the way and unlikely to be blocked inadvertantly.

You would also have to provide a way to keep air flowing through the
heat exchangers when the heat is off.  You could just leave the fan on
&quot;low&quot; speed all the time, or you could work out some sort of &quot;flapper
valve&quot; that would allow air from the engine fan to go to the boxes
unless the electric fan starts blasting away.
