well....

After finance charges and insurance and everything on that new beetle, you
would probably have enough money to fix chicago rust on a bus 10X over,
and install AC to boot...

But, thats MHO, and i dont plan on driving my 61 in the salt, i have a 71
for that.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i only have 2 running vehicles, a 71 bus and a 61 bus. I live 20+
miles from work. I have no heat. It gets cold here. I have no ac.  It
gets pretty damn hot here. I am happy as a pig in mud.
