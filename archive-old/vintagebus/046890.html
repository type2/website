&lt;&lt; My 61 transaxle has that throwout shaft with the bolt instead of the 
splines through it... the arm that attaches to the clutch is bent instead
 of straight.&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
You can easily just install the slightly later curved arm with splines inside 
of it.  Along with the later TO shaft with external splines.  Just make sure 
the end of the boden tube is aimed correctly through the eye clutch cable 
arm. 
 
&lt;&lt; Now, i wanted to get one of those welded arms that dune buggy guys are so
 fond of, but found out i cant get em for my style of arm... just the splined 
kind... (unless anyone knows different?)&gt;&gt;
Yes, you can get the special dune buggy type or just weld a bead around the 
arms on a stocker.  Just make sure the bead does not interfer someplace on 
the tranny.

&lt;&lt;So, if i decide to update, what all is involved... i would assume i would 
have to change or bend the bracket that the bowden tube goes into as the 
clutch lever would be straight instead of bent and in a different place left 
to right orientation.  Would i then need to specify a different year of 
clutch cable???&gt;&gt;
Well the bracket that holds the rear end of the clutch boden tube is cast 
into the tranny side plate.  So to change that you would have to remove the 
tranny, dissassemble, and replace the side plate with the proper one after 
measuring for the proper thickness of shims for the differential.  Changing 
the arm will not change the needed length of the clutch cable.  
 
&lt;&gt;
While you are replacing things in there you might want to pick up a new 
clutch cable, and a wing nut for it.  The clutch cable has to have a thicker 
stud end than the earlier to fit in a wing nut.  Then just file off the 
locking nubs that lock the wing nut has for the later straight clutch cable 
arm with the diamond shaped hole through it. 
   We had a clutch cable fail at a meet.  Turned out that the spare cable we 
had once it was installed (Duh!) had too big of a stud to fit our earlier 
14/11mm locking nuts combo.  So we went around to the dealers of new parts, 
and bought a wing nut to fit.  Modified the wing nut with a file we carry, 
and many years later, and many tens of thousands of miles we are still very 
happy with this setup.  When the clutch cable needs adjusting it is all so 
easy to just clamp on a pair of Vise-Grips onto the stud, and adjust the wing 
nut in a minute by hand.    Eric&amp;Barb
