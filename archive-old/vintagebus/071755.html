Subject: Re: [VB] 72-74 tank retrofitable?

----- Original Message -----
&gt; New to the vintage scene with my '65, and I hear everyone talking about
the inherent hipness of the 15gal. bay tanks.
&gt;
&gt; Got a line on a '72 tank. Will this tank fit?
&gt;

I'm not sure what bay window tank I have in my 64 bus right now, but I had
to do a little clearancing on the bottom rear edge of the tank to fit right
in my bus. A hammer did the job well.

Fuel gauge works perfect, I didn't have to do anything. It actually reads
more accurate than the stock sending unit did.haha.

Like mentioned before, the vent comes from the middle of the tank instead of
through the cap like the early tank. I ran hose up near the gas cap and it
seems to work alright. With a full tank, if I take a left hand turn too
sharp, I can smell gas. I need to put the vent to a small resivoir or
something so the fuel has somewhere to go if it does go up the hose on those
hard turns.  :-)
