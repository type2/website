Subject: [VB] Fluted Lenses


&gt;Does anyone know much about fluted lenses?  I have a set of Bosch fluted
&gt;lenses.  They are marked with the Bosch logo a E1 inside a circle, a 4
&gt;digit number (4452 on one and 4441 on the other) below that.  The Bosch
&gt;name and then Germany Importe D'Allemagne (French??) below.
&gt;
&gt;I beleive these are asymetrical lenses.  Each one is slightly different,
&gt;yet would appear to be left and right versions.
&gt;Anyone know what year these might be from?  I've got a '65, would these
&gt;be correct?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Steve
