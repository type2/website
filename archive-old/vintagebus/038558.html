I am hoping it turns out to just be a bad dream but........

After getting the left RGB rebuilt (thanks for the help Chad) I went back
through to check the torgue on the springplate to RGB bolts on the right
side and found that the forward one was stripped. I spoke to a local VW
mechanic and he told me that he could put a Time Sert in the hole and it
would be as good as new!

It was my intention to take him up on his offer to do the work but I thought
I would also take a crack at running a tap through in the hole and replacing
the M12x1.5c25mm bolt with a fresh one to see if could get any grip.

Last night I took of the wheel to get better access. I still could not get
at it the way I wanted so I decided to unbolt the RGB from the springplate
completly. I had done this on the other side when the bearings were replaced
and it seemed reasonable to do this,

For whatever reason the RGB fell away from the springplate but would not
give me better alignment for cleaning the thread with a tap and after about
an hour struggle decided to put it back together and leave well enough
alone. Too late!

During the process of trying to reallign everything I managed to strip out
the upper rear hole in the RGB while trying to crank down the bolt to pull
the spring plate to the same plane as the RGB. I do not reacall having this
type of problem on the other side.

Now I am faced with only TWO bolts holdiing the RGB and springplate
together. I know that this is DANGEROUS and needs to be fixed. Can I get by
with putting it back together and gently driving it five miles to the shop
so they can put Time Serts in both holes? Should I have it towed instead?
