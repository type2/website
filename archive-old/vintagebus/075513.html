&gt;&gt; I use high temperature wheel bearing grease on the threads.  I don't
&gt;&gt; think there should be any on the stars themselves.
&gt;
&gt;One should put on either grease or better yet never sieze on the threads
&gt;and the outer diameter of the brake stars so they do not sieze to the
&gt;bore they are installed in.

Ah.  I wasn't clear.  I agree that there should be some kind of goop on
the threads and on the smooth shaft that goes into the bore.  I was trying
to say that I didn't think there should be any goop on the teeth of the
star - the notches that you catch with a screwdriver to adjust the brakes.
The idea being that goop there might be slightly more likely to get on
to the linings, and would probably make adjusting the brakes difficult
as your screwdriver would tend to slip off the teeth.
