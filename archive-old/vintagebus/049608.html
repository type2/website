Subject: Re: practicing the silk thread trick...
Message-Id: &lt;v02130503b42f1757140a_at_[209.245.213.175]&gt;

&gt;My uncle used to use his alluminum foil for rod
&gt;bearings...and shoe strings for fan belts....but then
&gt;again they say half his blood came from a Jack Daniels
&gt;bottle too.
&gt;
&gt;Silk thread?  You gotta be kiddin' me???
&gt;
&gt;This is a &quot;its Friday&quot; joke right??
&gt;


Nope - both Hoover and my local guru suggest it. Think I've seen a few
other mentions in garage manuals over the years.
YOU MUST USE SILK!! Poly or cotton will not crush right, and will leave a
potential leak area. Silk squishes just right, and adds just a lil bit more
protection to help seal an older case - one w/ nicks and dings betwixt the
casehalves, in all likelihood.

BTW, a neighbor had a rodbearing go on a 51 chevy truck in
MiddleONowhere'sville when he was a kid; Dad whipped off his belt, cut a
section of leather out, oiled it, and used it to replace the bearing. Got
em home. Many early bearings were leather to START with.

Don't laugh at old tech - many tricks like that have been tried and tested
since the steam age, and can still be helpful today.
We will need these tricks as parts for our beasts get hard to find; at
least w're luckier than the poor sob's buying modern cars - finding WORKING
computercontrol modules in junkyards is gonna be a HOOT! And try replacing
the ABS controller w/ yer belt!
