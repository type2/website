...Hello All,

When I take my 66' kombi on the highway for any longer than 5-10 minutes,

when I slow down, My oil sender light flickers on.  If I give it gust the

slightest rev, the light immediatly goes out, but will return until I get

moving again.  Any thoughts??? I have an 1835cc motor with only about 4000

miles on it.  I try to keep my speed under 65 w/ the reduction gears, as I

am aware of  the bad highway gearing and all.

a flickering oil light from freeway driving indicates that the oil is getting
thinner, and pressure dropping.  Revs put the pressure up, but still the oil
lubricating properties aren't so good.  Sounds like it may be running a little
hot.   This would be causing wear on your motor more than it would like.   How
hot is your motor running?     Can you hold the dipstick?  Does spit on the
case boil instantly into the air?   What weight oil do you use?   Try not
going over 60 mph.  (Do you have a tach you can check your rpms with?)  Though
you have a bigger motor than the 1500 the bus came with new, the motor size
does not affect the rpm to road speed ratio- that is gearing and wheel/tire
size.   You could change to a thicker weight oil.   Make sure all your cooling
stuff is in place, tin under the motor, good motor to body seals,  no rag in
the fan, fan belt properly adjusted etc.  I figure is is probably pretty warm
in S Florida this time of year anyway, which does not help cooling any.
