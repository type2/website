&lt;&lt; So what your saying is to leave the bug axles in, just flip the ring gear, 
put on the Bus tubes &amp; install the redux boxes to the tubes? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Yes, and no, or is that no, and yes?  Not sure that the bug axles will fit 
lengthwise in the bus axle tubes.  So you might have to remove them to fit on 
the bus axle tubes.  This is easily done by only removing a large 
compressable C-clip per axle.  Since you were interested in just being able 
to roll and not drive the bus this setup will work.  It would even work this 
way for towing if everything is bolted down correctly.  Plus this system 
could be easily lightened by using a tranny case that has been emptied of all 
of it's gearing! 

&lt;&lt;Two questions,1 will the top redux gear fit on the bug axle?&gt;&gt;
No they will not work that way.

&lt;&lt;2. would this be considered a big nut or small?&gt;&gt;
The lower axle determines the large nut or small nut in the bus not the upper 
axle.

&lt;&gt;
Well it would really lower your top speed that is for sure due to the wrong 
gearing especially fourth gear.

&lt;&lt;Thanks Yall....  &gt;&gt;
You are welcome.   Eric&amp;Barb
