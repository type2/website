Subject: Paint Codes vs Formulae

It's not as simple as &quot;color codes,&quot; which is (no offense) usually
the problem faced by people who are inexperienced with paint.

The &quot;color code&quot; on your mtag is the internal code VW used to
represent that color.  You can't waltz into a paint store
and say &quot;Hey Joe, mix me up a gallon of L31, would ya?&quot;   With
a new car you *can* - but not with your 40 year-old VW.  And believe
me, a time will come when you won't be able to get paint
mixed by code for your '99 Saturn.  Accept it, it's a fact of
life and obsolescence.

Each paint vendor (PPG, Omni, Mason, Glasurit, Sikkens, etc) has
their own formula system.  Sometimes you're lucky, and the
paint maker already has a formula which corresponds to your
VW code.  It's not very common.  For some colors, people have
had luck with Glasurit or Sikkens, which are German, but I've
also heard of paints built on these forulae to be way off.

There are &quot;formulas&quot; out there from old VW literature.  That
formula, and 75cents, could get you a nice hot steaming cup of coffee
somewhere.  The formulas in those books are useless because the
materials (pigments, etc) haven't been made in years.

What are your options?  Personally, I try to get a nice original-color
piece and have it matched.  No, this isn't perfect, but at least
you have a solid reference to go by.  It seems to be hit-or-miss
going by formula alone.

If you *do* get it matched, pay the extra money and get them to 
create a formula for you.  My local paint place charges $50 for
this.  &quot;Wow, that's a lot&quot; you say; yeah, but I had to go buy 
more paint for the '55, and guess what?  It didn't match exactly.
The $50 would have been worth it at that point.

I'd be more than happy to create a formula page if people had the 
data for the modern paints.
