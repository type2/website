Is this true? I thought that the 200mm 6v flywheel was in fact the same
diameter as the 12v flywheel, and took the same bellhousing. The reason
I believe this is because I have put 12v flywheels in 65,66 buses and
only some of the time had to hog out the inside of the bellhousing, some
times 12v fit right in.... 

Someone else that knows for sure care to comment? E and B?

&gt; You're getting the clutch diameters (180 and 200mm) confused with flywheel
&gt; diameters for the 6V and 12V applications.
&gt; There have never been any 6V flywheels that are the same diameter as 12V.
&gt; Some aftermarket set ups perhaps...but not from VW.

&gt; &gt; Wait. Didn't all 6v '66s come with a 6v 200mm flywheel, thus
&gt; &gt; necessitating the larger &quot;12v size&quot; bellhousing even in the 6v version,
&gt; &gt; thus allowing them to use the same trans case for the 6v standard and 12
&gt; &gt; option?
