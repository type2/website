Interesting point about M361 being camping stuff, but if that was true, you 
should see other campers with that code.  No early, or late campers for that 
matter in the registry have 361.  My bus is caught between two eras, it's 
probably one of the &quot;newer&quot; flipseat campers around.  SO-42 production had 
already started before my SO-35 came out, (I think, somebody correct me if 
I'm wrong, 30 sep 1963 production, chassis 1176847).  Maybe 361 meant DC 
stuff up until around 61, then it meant something else when mine came along. 
  If there were more busses with 361, that would help.  Does anybody know if 
Mcodes ever got &quot;recycled&quot;?

&gt;This really seems funny that most of this seems like camping set up stuff, 
&gt;other than the sliding door. Most of the busses that had M361 are 59 and 
&gt;early 60 Double cabs. Did the M codes ever get reassigned as something else 
&gt;at a later date?
