funny this comes up now. I was wondering what the public VB opinion
was about asking the admins to merge VB back into the T2 list. here's
a few reasons why it might be considered

from the VB view:
lots of us sub to both lists anyway and get crossposts for topics
might be able to probe the knowledge of the upright engines from T2
a bit more traffic

from the T2 view:
take out the crossposts and the additional VB posts aren't that much
great depth of knowledge from the VB folks
who doesn't like a trip report of a split window bus :)

just some food for thought.
