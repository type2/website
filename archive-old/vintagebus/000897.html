stephen and i went for a havasu bus hunt trip today to follow up on
a 62 double cab that i had heard about, after heading out I 40 to the
 appointed meeting place, arriving early we decided to drive around a little
to see
what else we could find in the area, cruiseing down the road i spoted a very
cool
1 wheel trailer with an aluminum body, but at that moment the person i was
supposed to meet
drove up to guide me to the double cab, so i told stephen we will come back
to check the
trailer out latter.  after about a 2 mile trip down a washboard dirt road we
came across
the place where the double cab and ton's of assorted other stuff were at.

after checking out the double cab and all the stuff the owner said comes
with it i decided to
buy it. then we went rooting around to see what else i could find, looking
around i spotted another
single wheel trailer, (i have been looking for 1 for 2 years) so in less
then an hour i find 2!
after a little haggling i owned it also. then more rooting, the owner
showing me more parts
that came with the bus when i stumbled on a 3 burner old colemen white gas
stove, had to have
it also, so there went another 5 bucks.  got to love this az desert, it's
amazing what stuff there is still
around, especially so close to home, who would have thought, especially
since it seems that we
have scoured every mile of desert roads within a hundred miles of here, and
the last 4 havasu
finds were all at our back doors.

will have picts posted on www.yourvw_dot_com/ronnie in a day or so and go check
out
vwhowards new bus at www.yourvw_dot_com/vwhoward

with the double cab i got 3 engine lids, a pile of window frames, a few
bumpers
seats, engines and piles of tin and the owner is still looing for all the
steering wheels/boxes
and assorted other junk he has collected the last 15+odd years.

he also has a few honda  trail 70's and 90's, a car and a bunch of other
assorted stuff he
wants to get rid of.

it seems people can complain about a problem to all, but can't seem to face
the problem to sort it out,
life is to short, and we all love our buses and there always is a simple
solution to keep all happy
(this was a message sent to me)
