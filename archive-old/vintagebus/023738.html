Subject: re: trans howling

Hi all,

I've got a '64 Sundial Camper that is howling in 3rd and 4th, but only
when
the accelerater is pushed, if I let off it stops.  Plus a very high
pitched
whistle when clutch is in, when at a stop.  This goes away if I push the
gas a
bit then comes back at idle again.  I've topped off the gear lube in the
trans
and red. gear boxes but still no help.  Any tips?

Thanks

Jeff

 Sounds to me like your tranny main bearings are gone.  The high
pitched whistle might be a bad throwout bearing since it only makes
noise when the clutch pedal is pressed in.  Might be time to rebuild or
replace it.  Good luck with your trans.
