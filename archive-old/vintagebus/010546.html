Subject: Correct bumper 66 Westfalia

In an effort to start aquiring the correct parts for my 66 I am not sure
what the correct bumpers are.  I have a decent rear bumper that is somewhat
rounded and when it comes around the side it is longer up top than on the
bottom.  A gentleman I was talking told me this is incorrect.  I have also
been told by the M code info that my bus was purchased in Europe by an
american tourist, does that make a diffenence.  Additionally the front end
has the two middle brackets to hold the bumper but not the two that are by
the front doors, just a hole, not terribly rusty.  Can I get new brackets. I
will be taking pictures this weekend and will hopefully have up on a web
site by next week.  I have located a overrider non deluxe bumper can I go
w/that.  Also what are the going rates for the following items I am looking
for.  Westfalia light, radio or radio blockoff plate, bumper!  Just for
laughs I brought the 66 over to my parents again to start brake work and
stupid hard start problem reoccured so I will install the 6V WR1 today! They
didn't laugh!  Great to be back on the list, Thanks Thom, Ken, Steve and H.
Steve for all your hard work.  Beers are on me if we are ever in the same area.

Have a great safe weekend!
