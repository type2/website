Subject: door swap?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

does anyone know if the 64-67 front doors can be used on a 63 with or without 
modification? or someone mentioned earlier the possibility of installing a 
later door handle on 63 doors. I'm just trying to figure out a mystery bus, 
And I've seen early 64s with pull handles so it does not seem likely that a 
late 63 would have push buttons. what gives? Again, sorry for the testing 
post.
