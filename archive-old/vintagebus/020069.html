All the talk of smashed buses lately has me thinking
of 
insurance, Can anyone recomend a good company for
collector/antique auto insurance? 
I can add it on to my drivers policy for $120 every 6 
months, but thats with me never driving it, I was
hoping for a limited number of miles per year sort of
thing. I know its been discussed but I havent been
able to read the messages in the archives for a few
days now. any input is appreciated.

The insurance that I have on my 65 double cab and 75
bus cost us about $120 per year for both vehicles, and
is for &quot;stated value&quot;--they cover for the value we
have decided on for the vehicles, comprehensive and
collision, no deductible. They wouldn't insure the 75
bus until it was 25 years old. I have to have a garage
to keep them in, and they have to be restored, or in
the process of being restored, and they can't be my
only or primary driving vehicles--can't drive them to
work regularly, etc.  The limit the yearly mileage to
&quot;reasonable&quot; or some such term, but said 5000 miles is
within &quot;reasonable&quot;.

I was able to insure both vehicles year round with
better coverage with this policy, for about what it
cost to insure just the double cab for 6 months each
year, with only liability and uninsured motorist
coverage.

Almost forgot--the company is &quot;Hagerty&quot; which I think
someone else also mentioned.
