Subject:  SKF N207E RGB bearing price

Greetings,

Following my last hazy question about big nut
RGBs (why didn't I think of splitting the box
- thanks Clara) I have stumbled on something interesting.


I checked the archives and found quoted retail prices of around $US90 
in the US for the SKF or FAG N207E roller bearing.  Apparently ths this for
a
single bearing????????   Would someone like to check on this??????

I have sourced a limited number of SKF C3 N207E's here and the
fact they are 'old stock' (old buying price) coupled with the weak Aussie
dollar
means I could airmail a pair
of bearings into the US for around US$100 all up. 

Would anyone be interested? 

There is no fat into this 'pass-on' price and there is no margin for
the costs associated with processing checks or currency conversion.
You would have to be able to electronically transfer funds from
your bank to mine...... 

A little community service is good for the soul 8-).....
