Subject: Re: [VB] campmobile 70 Q

&gt; Does anyone know what year a Westphalia Tag that says &quot;Campmobile 70&quot; on it comes from or knows what this
kamp kit is from?

My guess would be from a 1970 and up Westy.
68's used Campmobile 67 kits in them. Here is a 68 Westy owners manual:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/68WestyManual.html
On the front cover and on page 1 it calls the kit Campmobile 67.

My 77 Westy uses the Campmobile 70 kit.

On the plate on yours, it should have a number stamped in it after the 70, then a painted on period, then more
numbers stamped. i.e Campmobile 70 7.01767   In this example, the 7 means 1977. [my 77 Westy]
I believe each one is dated the same.
I put a full width Westy bench seat/bed from a 1974 Westy in my 66 bus and the tag says Campmoile 70  4.07572
I know I took it out of 74 Westy.
