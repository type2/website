I have a question.  If all of us on the VintageBus listserv and type2 list
took a vote and decided we did want the archives published (even though we
know what the &quot;agreement&quot; was when we signed up), would that make any
difference?  Here is my vote that says you can publish my words and sell
them for gain and profit because I don't care.  My email box is so full of
spam as it is, I could use a few more for the hell of it.  If the vote was
unanimous, would THAT change anything???

I'm also wondering if you walked up to the average Joe on the street and
asked them how many mp3's they had on their computer, and how many
vintagebus and vintagevw posts they had on their computer, we'd soon get an
idea of just how pithy and small this whole list really is.  I doubt any
major corporations would topple.  Then again, did the archives contain any
of Bob Hoover's posts?  It's a pity shame that our conversations which we
choose to spread via computer, have fallen into the realm of &quot;copyright&quot; and
all those kinds of laws.  Damn.
