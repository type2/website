I am the one who bought the OTHER yellow 21 window that we saw on Ebay a
month back. My wife christened her Lucy. I am very happy with her so far
(both her and Lucy). No real rust and original straight metal.
Lucy is lowered, but I have never lowered a bus. Due to its ride I expect
that springs were cut. Looking under the bus, what is the best way to tell
lowering method? I would like dropped spindles to restore ride (tell me if
this doesn’t work). Anyone know of a good VW mechanics near Charlotte, NC?

Excited to be on list!
