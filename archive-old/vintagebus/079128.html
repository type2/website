Subject: Re: [VB] under pedal spash pans - how many kinds?

i thought there were only two as well. I looked at the parts heap and the
buses, and i only have the two listed as 50's and 60's in that ad. (the
furthest right on the bottom)being from a 67 parts bus, the rest being like
the one in the middle(back to my 57).


&gt; I was looking at the samba and saw this ad... it has pictures of 3
versions
&gt; of the 3/55-67 pedal pan.  I thought there were two versions.     Anyway,
the
&gt; pics are nice and clear showing the differences, so anyone who cares about
this
&gt; trivia take a look.
