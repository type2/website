 You could probably just take the drain pan in and dump it that way (they 
have a big vat of oil you just dump yours into)  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
On our long trips we have most of our tools in a US military ammo box that 
seal perfectly even after ten years of abuse.  Remove tools to be temporaryly 
paper bagged and use ammo box for short time oil pan until one gets to 
nearest FLAPS to properly dispose of the used oil and filter.
