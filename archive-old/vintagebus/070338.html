Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Hula Girl/BobbinHead website...

I can remember in 73 in our high school metal shop we had a foundry and made
a bunch of the feet gas pedals and the feet shifter balls.  We also had a
hand flashing the peace sign and made aluminum one of those but we would cut
one of the fingers off.  Can you guess which one?

&gt; I managed to pick up not only the small foot dimmer switch and the big
&gt; foot gas pedal, but at some obscure swap meet last year I found the
&gt; chrome foot shift knob. It is a chrome steel ball with four &quot;Hang Ten&quot;
&gt; style feet cast into the top of the shift knob.

&gt; just had to brag a little,
