&lt;&lt; Does anyone know how to operate the gas heater mentioned above? there's a 
little knob under the drivers seat and what looks like a tiny red light. I'm 
guessing this the heater control.&gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
To switch on gas heater.
   Pull out knob with warning lamp in it.  Lamp must light up, if not bulb 
needs replacing, or wiring needs fixing.  The solid knob with the &quot;H&quot; on it 
regulates heater output from 40-100C above outside air.  Increase is adjusted 
by pulling this knob out.

To shut off heater.
   Push in the knob with the light.  The indicator light should go off about 
three minutes later.  WARNING: do not restart heater during this three minute 
cool down phase of the heater.  To do so would introduce fresh fuel to a hot 
chamber with loads of fresh air resulting in POSSIBLE EXPLOSION!

&lt;&lt;Also, I'm having a little (Problem?) starting her up.  The battery says 
it's putting out 6v. I cleaned the battery terminals and the ground 
connection.  Also cleaned up the connections at the starter, but it turns 
over slow and sometimes just stops turning the engine. After it starts it 
runs great. I noticed that the lead to the starter has got juice even when 
the key is in the off position. Is this normal? &gt;&gt;
Battery should be putting out 6.5-7 volts, but 6 should do it.  Are your 
cable clamps whole, or have the clamp ends been replaced?  If so any 
corrosion between the cable and the calmps will cause trouble.  Next check 
that the ground cable from the battery is clean where it connects the body, 
and check the same for the tranny to body cable.  Then check the starter by 
putting the VW in neutral with the E-brake on, and jumper from the starter to 
the solinoid electrical fitting to see if the starter will work at all.  
Check voltage to the ignition switch, and back to the solinoid.  If all of 
all is working well then take out the starter, and check it for worn brushes. 
 Yes, the starter always should have voltage to it.  It is the solinoid that 
gets the voltage from the ignition switch to pull the starter gear rearward, 
and turn on the motor to spin the flywheel.   Eric&amp;Barb
