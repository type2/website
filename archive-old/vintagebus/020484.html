(Sorry if this is a duplicate- I sent it about the
time that the www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect went
down. Didn't see it on the archives).
----------------------------------------------


For me, it's the dog days of summer...

Returned home from work in the F-150 the other day.
Another day of Point A to Point B, Point B to Point A
with an RCH of feigned Aerospace employment and
helicopter noise in between. Melting concrete freeways
at 75 mph and getting passed on both sides like I was
site seeing, standing still or driving a splitty bus
on both legs of the daily journey. Phoenix drivers
travel like their hair is on fire. This town is now
commonly referred to as LA in the microwave. No
surfing unless it's on heat waves. The incontinent
transients and the ever increasing numbers of illegal
amigos haunting the Circle K Stores don't seem to
grasp that humor. No comprende, donde est la tarjetas?
Beats me Julio, I'm looking too! When the ex-yuppie
dot-gone refugees hear that comment they just smile
and continue to sack the groceries and nod so as to
not get fired-again. Stock options my ass, they should
have sold short and taken the cash...
Anyway, the local TV station, &quot;3-TV, The Place with
more Chicks&quot; was mentioning an airport temperature of
120f. We basically live at the airport judging from
the  incessant helicopter flight path noise. Paula
went out side to fire up the '67 Dormant Camper. She
insisted on letting it run a few minutes so the
battery wouldn't go dead. I figured whatever floats
her boat is fine by me as long as I don't have to bail
or row. She eventually came back inside. &quot;Damn it's
hot outside,&quot; she said. I agreed and had her give the
daughter another lesson on fetching cold beer without
shaking or dropping. I remember asking who's your
Daddy like it was a &quot;Pop&quot; quiz or something. I'm still
trying to figure that one out. At least she can carry
12 ouncers on occassion. Then again she hasn't learned
about Gloria Steinem- yet. Tom Browkaw was coming on
and the pot pies were all most done... I made a vague
promise to fix the steering box and K&amp;L's when the
next boat comes in, when I get past this layoff notice
or if we hit the California State Lotto. Paula didn't
seem to hear me because of the 3-TV helicopter leaf
blower in the sky noise. Just the same I'll probably
get to it before nice bus driving weather hits again ~
in January. It ought to be down to 80f by then. In the
meantime, I'm thankful for the Ford, the CD player,
Merle Haggard's &quot;Chill Factor&quot;, and any air
conditioning that I can find. 

It's the dog days of summer. There ain't NOTHIN'
air-cooled in southern Arizona right now. Just a lot
of hot air...
