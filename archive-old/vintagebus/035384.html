 I have never seen a bus with this color!  And I find it strange that no-one
 on the list seems to have a digital photo or the location (URL) of a pic
 with such a bus.  SO.  I ask you if you would be so kind as to check out the
 one pic at the following address....is the bug (which I miss very much) Sea
 Blue or not?  If not, well, what is it?
 
 http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Seablue.htm
  &gt;&gt;

that bug looks like the blue of a sea blue/ blue white 65 bus

I dont have a collection of photoes of original paint, but the bus with the 
&quot;barndoors&quot; for sale on ebay recently was that colour.
