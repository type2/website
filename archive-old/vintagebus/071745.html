Subject: Yakima Trip Report

somehow it took till 3pm saturday till we were packed and ready to go.    Definately taking things on a mellow time scale.   So headed south in the red and white 61 15 window microbus and then east on 12 to take White Pass over the Cascades.  Good view of Rainier from the south, and there is very little snow on it.   only saw a couple small. patches of snow from the road on the hearer peaks, though it was colder at the pass (4500ft) than the 70s it was in Oly.   Oil temps got up to just over 200F at the peak, then dropped to 160 -170 going down the steep downhill the other side.  Back to 180-190 when I had to give it gas to keep going.  Going down the Teiton River saw one river rafter group in action, but I think a lot had just got out, as people were standing around damply in wetsuits.

On the east side of the mountains we got in the sunshine a time or two, but it was rapidly running away, and the sun set, with pretty red light on the dry hillsides where you could see the layers of rock.

Camped out, and went to the show which was held in Naches in the am.   There was a nice group of people who put this show on.   David mayes had his cherry picker truck.  I had a tasty latte made in the espresso bus.  It was sunny and warm.   Some dude hit a deer in his green/white 21 window coming over White Pass the night before.  Funny, my friend Jason hit an elk with his 65 hardtop deluxe up there a couple years ago, crushed the left headlight bucket in so far it pressed the clutch pedal down so he cut the clutch cable and drove it home w/o clutch. We swapped his running gear into a new (nearly rust free)bus. He lives in New Mexico now, wonder if he showed up to Jerome in his 66 hardtop deluxe.  anyway.....

Unfortunately there weren't any early westys to be seen.  I did pick up a pigtail tailpipe with dampner pipe for $5, then another swapper sold me a nice barely used leistrichtz bus muffler to go with it for another $10.  score.  For some reason I didn't get the truck gas tank covers for my 63.  I think I didn't want to spend money on a rat truck before it runs.   Did you see them, David?  They had original felts. 

eventuallly in the late afternoon packed up the bus and headed back out.   Got gas before leaving town, and have been getting ~25-26 mpg since swapping over to a 28pict carb earlier in the summer.   Followed 3 things up hwy 12, but passed them when they stopped to put sweaters on  (at least that's what it looked like)  back over white pass, and hit traffic near Centralia on I-5, took ages to go 10miles, but got though it eventually.   

The bus was due for a tuneup when we got back.
turned out the valves were about a thousandths tight on 3 of them. oil fine not too dirty, plugs nice and tan,  greased the suspension, adjusted links.   think I'll put grease/oil mix in the steering gear box as I'm tired of it dripping gear oil.
