Subject: tranny

I have been following Scott Frasers posts with great interest. Who
wouldn't love the power of the type four engine for long trips?

When this subject first appeared, I visited Joe Cali's site as well as
others. Believing that the type 4 conversion was too good to be true, I
emailed Bob Hoover for his take on the subject. He stated that the type2
tranny wasn't set up to handle the torque and that, at the very least, a
rear engine crossmember would have to be added to handle the weight and
to help manage the torque. Now that Scott is experiencing tranny
problems, it would apppear the Bob was right (once again :)).

Now for my question. Will the type four tranny fit into a splitty?? And,
if so, just how much of a hack job would need to be done to do so??
