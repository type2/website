Subject: Re: [VB] Tachometer Install?

Hi Seth,
Sounds like you connected up the ground wire to the head light  switch.  You 
should take the head light switch apart and rebuild it.   See the article on 
how to do that in the type2_dot_com library.
  BTW what colors of wires are coming from the tach or does it just  have 
connection points on the front (FIF) of the tach?
