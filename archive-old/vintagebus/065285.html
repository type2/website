Subject: Re: Sheared RB bolt - clues?

I should clarify - the bolt I sheared is one of the one that goes
thru the spring plate into the reduction box housing.  FWIW, the
procedure is still the same.  The $20 question is, do I pull the
trans back out for this?

&gt;   My advice...Go slow!, you must try to get the exact center of the bolt!
&gt; Punch, Drill, and use an easy-out to take the bolt out, E&amp;B recommend
&gt; going a bit further and use longer RGB studs. Then tap and replace with a
&gt; time cert.  I'll let you borrow mine to save you a few bucks.
