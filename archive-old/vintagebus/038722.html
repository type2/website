Thanks to all who responded.  I had no clue to what the rider or lobe or
even how the darn thing works.  It helped a lot to just take out the old
points and examine what was going on and how it works.  I ended up replacing
the points and setting the gap as you suggested.  The bus started right up,
and no lie, runs 100% better.  I was blaming my troubles on cold weather,
but its not even cold out at all... As I compared the points, the rider on
the old set looked to be very worn down.
