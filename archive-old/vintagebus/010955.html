Hi all,
I would like to thank NQ and all of the out of town visitors to the OVWC Show
last Saturday. We really had a great time and being able to share VW talk 
with so many new faces was outstanding. As NQ said we increased the entered Bus count 
to 6. There were several that came to the show but chose not to enter. I was too 
busy having fun to take many pics. If anyone has some I would be happy to include 
them on the club page. If you build a page yourself I would like to create a link from 
our page for it. Just let me know.
I have to correct one thing that NQ reported. The 1st place award for Splitties
was not won by Brad's beautiful bus. It was won by ME! Was it a &quot;gift&quot; for hard work? 
Maybe, but as NQ said it is wonderful to get recognition for the hundreds of hours
of work. Brad has won every award for Busses since I started going to the show, and
well deserved, so I don't think he felt too bad. And he did win the Most Desirable 
Vehicle award with the help of all the other bus crowd. And besides my bus looked marvelous.
As for the broke down 66 at Rob's house, the wrencher guy was most grateful for access
 to my Bently. Seems he didn't know as much about VW trannies as he thought. To all you
AIRS folks, If you aren't ready for several days of support work be careful what 
you offer. We are at 4 days and counting at Rob's place. Nice kid's but a different place
in life ;)
NQ and I are making plans for BNNTA and hope to see many of you there. We will be taking the 
State highways through MO east from St Joe. Anybody got warnings or watchoutfors we should 
be aware of? Departure time still TBD but if there are other folks that would like to join us
let us knw.
I have also been convinced that the original name given to my bus when it moved under
it's own power after 25 years should be its forever name. So from now on it will be known 
as Frodo.(Read JRR Tolkien's Lord of The Rings if you do not recognize the name). Hppy Rob?

Terry Wolfe
Frodo a very happy 65 Westy
