Yes thats right a 1957 Westfalia trailer for sale. But don't rush to get too 
excited. It is a big one.. 15feet long! So unless you have a v8 you might 
just have to live in it. The add was in our local Buy and Sell. 1957 westy 
trailer with a trunk load full of extra parts $500. and thats Canadian ( 
$350 US ) I called the guy up and he told me it is pretty rare here in North 
America. Originally it was orange and white with the same striped tent as 
the VW Westy. It also has all the original badges and westy hubcaps.It needs 
a complete resto but is all there. Anyway his pager number is: 604-640-2397 
And his name is Clark.

PS: the ad is from Vancouver Canada
