Hi Adrian,
We have been using this H-4 type of headlight for years.  Definitely an 
improvment over the stock sealed beam ones.  You should solder the fuse box 
clips and headlight switch riveted parts together to prevent loose 
connections which causes voltage drop and high heat at these points.  Even 
though the H-4s are only 55/60 watts instead of the stock 50/55 watts, they 
can burn any of these loose voltage drop areas.  We found this out by having 
head light switches too hot to handle and singed wiring going to these 
switches!   Eric&amp;Barb
