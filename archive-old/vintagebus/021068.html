Ask your welder if he really means 
&gt; Dichromate plating.
&gt; That's the yellow color to which he refers. I
&gt; believe that cadmium
&gt; plating does not have to be yellow ( even tho that's
&gt; what the word means ).

When I was working as a receiving inspector for
McCulloch Corporation in the sixties, we got loads of
parts that called for &quot;cadmium plating with a
cronak(sp?) dip&quot;.  It was the dip that colored the
parts a yellowish tint.  I have no idea what it was,
but I've seen a lot of it!
