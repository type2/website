What kind of undercoating is it?  I'm not aware of any &quot;factory&quot;
undercoating (E&amp;B? C?)

My '54 has the same issue - tons of gummy undercoating.  I ended up using a
heat gun to warm up an area and peel it off.  Sandblasting was *useless* -
the undercoating absorbs the impact of the sand.

&gt;Like factory undercoating - whoa - this stuff is on there, in fact probably
&gt;about 90% of it is intact.  How thoroughly does this stuff have to come off.
&gt;I tried a heat gun and paint scrapper and it works but not as fast as a
&gt;propane torch and a paint scrapper but it will take me forever to get this
&gt;stuff off 100%.  How thorough is adequate.  It would seem to me that
&gt;sandblasting would be easier but then I would have sand everywhere in the
&gt;seems etc.  and that would be a rust trap, as well I would have to treat the
&gt;blasted metal with a metal conditioner and rinse it etc.. so that the
&gt;benifit over  not sand blasting would be marginal. I have searched the
&gt;archives and found few mentions of the best method to do this.
