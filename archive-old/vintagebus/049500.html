Subject: gas $$ = off topic = BORING

i could care less what folks in MT pay for apple polish...  besides, DON'T
get many of us listees started on HOW CHEAP gas is in the US due to
corporate welfare and gubmint boondoggling, etcetc.
my dad has worked for the oil companies as a mid-level type guy for 30
years. he tells me all this stuff and expects me to be HAPPY it goes on.

he is usually disappointed by my reaction :P
