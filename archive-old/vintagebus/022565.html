We have had a mail backlog, due to some server changes.  In addition, we
had some DNS problems, so the resultant zone &quot;trickle-down&quot; could hold mail
up for days in some cases.

&gt;Bus Content:  I have heard of a couple of friends lately who have found
NOS 16&quot; rims that were dated in the late fifties.  Are these replacement
rims built later or are they something else?

I've seen those as well; I've also seen 16&quot; wheels with the slotted pattern
like 15&quot; &amp; 14&quot; bus wheels.
