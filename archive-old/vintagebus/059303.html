Subject: Got me a 66 Kombi

Howdy All,
I just got back last night from around Kent, Ohio where I picked up my latest project, a '66 Kombi.  I haven't had a chance to really take a close look at it yet, but it looks like It shouldn't take a whole awful lot to get it going again. I'm gonna go through it this weekend, and i'm sure I'll be back here on Sunday evening with a bunch of questions.  Here's a photo link

See Y'all


Peace, John Baker
