&gt;The turn signals cycle on and off quickly without the front lights on,
&gt;and go rather slow when the front lights are on.

It's normal for them to slow down a little when the system voltage is
lower with the headlights on.  Do they speed back up if you rev up the
engine a bit?

&gt;Also, when the rear running lights are on and the turn signals are
&gt;activated, it is difficult to see the lights flash.  They do but its
&gt;real faint.

Normally I would say to check your grounds but it sounds like you have
already done that.  Are you sure you have the bulbs in the right way
around?  There is a &quot;bright&quot; and a &quot;dim&quot; filament and it is possible
to install them backwards - the bulbs are keyed but some sockets make
it easy to install them the wrong way.  The bright filament is nominally
7 times as bright as the dim filament, so you should notice quite a
difference between dim and dim+bright when the bulbs are installed
correctly.

&gt;When I activate my front lights and the turnsignals, my generator light
&gt;begins to glow.

Possibly normal at idle.  If it goes out when you rev the engine a little
then it's probably OK.
