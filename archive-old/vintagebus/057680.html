Subject: RE: [VB] thesamba_dot_com

&gt;Anyone know when the samba will be back up?? I'm going through withdraws=

I NEED MY SAMBA FIX!!!! AHHHHHHHH
&gt;
I hope it'll be back up later today.

It's up, it's just allowing 10-20 people at a time to connect instead of
3-400.

You can always email me directly if you have questions.
