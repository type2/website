I'd like to hear some tips on removing the vent wing glass.  They came out

real easy in my Type 3s but I tried to remove the glass from a scrap window

frame I had this weekend and it cracked.  Luckily it was some cheesy 
replacement

glass and not the real stuff so I busted the rest out with a hammer.

i use some wd 40 sprayed liberally.  then take a small screwdrove and at the 
end of the frame U channel pry the glass a bit.  do both ends, spray some wd 
40.  It will slide out.  id guess I do bend the frame a tad.    but not much

but have only done this with sekurit glass.  the stuff that is hard to break. 
 The crap replacement glass you had probably broke from being not the good 
tempered stuff.    Dont know what i would do if I was tring to take apart 
some nice sigla suff and not break it- ouch.
