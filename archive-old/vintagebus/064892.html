Subject: Re: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

some years ago jeremy vreeman and his buddy, ken, flew one-way to california for a rust-free bus.  they found a 1967 that'd sat unstarted/undriven in a garage for 10 years.  after about 15 minutes, jeremy had it out on a test drive.  he decided to buy it and after a weeks work, drove it from monterey, california to chicago without any plates.  he later told me that he was stopped once, in colorado i think, for not having plates.  he had all the sales documentation and didn't get a ticket.

cheers,
