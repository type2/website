&gt; That feeling when you go to shift a gear and POW

SNIP
&gt; I do have a question or two, HOW DO YOU DRIVE
&gt; WITHOUT A CLUTCH. 

Hi Meredith,
 The trick to drivin w/o a clutch is.... there is no
trick:) Its all practice... Best to learn when ya dont
have to. 
 You start off by killing the engine, put it in first,
when the light turns green start her up &amp; go. Goin
thru the gears is a matter of engine rpm in relation
to vehicle speed. You ever ride in an 18 wheeler? The
driver starts in first with the clutch &amp; doest touch
it again till the truck has to come to a complete
stop, unless ya miss a gear:( Fortunatly its easier
for us(4speed not a 13 speed w/double overdrive:) If
youll notice most 2 wheelers use the same method. I
still catch myself &quot;powershifting&quot; the B*g, &amp; the '62
single cab prefers I drive her by double shifting
2,3,&amp;4th:) When you get your cable put in, go
practice. Its like ridin a bike, the first time you do
it right, youll say to yourself &quot;OH, so thats how!&quot;

&gt; I can't believe how when this happened I felt even
&gt; more like she was
&gt; part of me, she was hurting and so was I. These
&gt; things do become a part
&gt; of you and your life.

Yes... That they do. Still trying to figure if its a
good thing or not:)
See Ya....
