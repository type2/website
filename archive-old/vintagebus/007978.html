&lt;&lt; how do I get off the 8 bolts (4 on each side) that hold the RGB's to the
spring plate?  &gt;&gt;

Have been out sick and missed the posts, but a thought on what I had to
do...

My 3/4 breaker bar wasn't even enough!  I ended up taking a crutch (Yes,
broken leg, get free crutches, then store in the garage for some unknown
reason) , pulling the end off, and stuck it around the end of my breaker
bar, deep enough to not bend the crutch metal.  By the time I got them all
off, the crutch was beat, but it worked.  Before that last-ditch effort, I
had spent a good two hours trying everything I could.  BTW, the tranny was
the original, and had never been out of the bus since 1962.
