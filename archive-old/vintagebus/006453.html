boy I don't know if I'd want to do business on a list like this - on the one
hand you get this great forum within which to advertise - sell your specials
etc.. - but you screw up a couple of times and - the whole world hears about
it - it also seems funny (ha ha) how in a few months the list consensus can
go from someone being great to someone being trashed - recall Todd,  or PLF
(they're good guys again right?).

If Bus Depot is doing so well - and if their biggest problem is that
business is just too good - then maybe that should be a queue (sp) to other
list members that opportunity is a knockin'.

I can't pass judgement on bus depot - though I did call there once and as
soon as it became clear that the person on the phone knew didly about buses
I bid 'em adieu - but I know that the one time I ordered from Ronnie at the
old volks home I got not only exactly what I ordered but exactly what I
needed and instructions as to how to put the parts in etc and an oppurtunity
to bullsh#t with someone who knows tons about EARLY buses ... in fact, I
would order exclusively from Ronnie but it just doesn't make sense to pay
this crazy brokerage fee that UPS charges - believe it or not but they base
it on the value of what your ordering - so if you order a tiny but expensive
part you pay a bigger brokerage fee than if you order a huge but inexpensive
part - that's nuts!

I also have a pile of parts that I ordered from CaliforniaImports that I'm
just too lazy to send back - or rather why bother spending 5 bucks to send
back a 4 dollar seal.
