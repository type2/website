At a show in Milwaukee today I saw a couple of nice type 1's outfitted with
Denman 5.60X15's with wide whitewalls.
I'd kind of like to get a set of these for my '66 beetle and my '66 Westy as
well.
I've also been looking at the Coker tire of a comparable size.
Any thoughts on what is the best tire, and how much the Denman's cost?
thanks
John
