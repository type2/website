Subject: RE: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment

I used Gunk Foamy engine bright,  followed by simple green, lots of
scrubbing. Hot H20 from hot water heater drain helped. Very nasty. Much
better, no OE paint lost, expect for what was rusted on apron already.

Subject: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment


wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk
out of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple
green and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a
little paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats
left of the original paint. ronnie
