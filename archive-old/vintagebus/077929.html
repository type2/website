Hi all,

I recently discovered a small bag of colorful plastic VW Wolfsburg Factory
Tour lapel/pocket badges buried deep in my stash of &quot;Return to the Fatherland
Tour&quot; momentos...

Just for fun I put some on eBay for VW collectors who might enjoy adding them
to their stash.  Simple...  cool... cheap...

Suddenly I started feeling guilty that I didn't offer them to you guys first,
so I am now.  To make up for my &quot;brain fart&quot;, if you'd like any, you could
check out the auction (#2230783731) for a better description, colors and the
photos and then you could contact me personally with any &quot;wants&quot;.  Now I feel
better that you've been offered a crack at the few I have left.

I don't intend this as a spam or solicitation.  I just suddenly realized that
if I sold out my spare cool badges to the eBay crowd before offering any of
the booty to my true VW buddies first, I just couldn't go on living...

On another topic, does anyone know of a software program that a consumer could
afford and load and use on a PC (Windows XP system) that could be used to
inventory VW Bus parts similar to the way VW does (VW part numbering system,
description, applications, etc.  I've got a basement FULL of VW parts for the
eight VW's (four Type 2's) we own and I wondered if I could make some sense of
it with modern technology.  Probably a stupid and very time-consuming idea...

Have a great weekend!

Bill Bowman
