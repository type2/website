&lt;&lt;  IS THIS THE BRAILLE METHOD ???   does any one else have this problem? &gt;&gt;

Hi John,
We have a small round mirror on the passenger side, but still had a large 
blind spot in our 60 panel camper conversion and 63 SC with tilt on.  Turning 
the interior mirror so as to allow the driver to peer diagonally out the 
passenger window reduces this area to alot smaller problem.   Eric&amp;Barb
