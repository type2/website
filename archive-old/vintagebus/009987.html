I accidentally deleted a message from someone who made a reference to
getting some dual carbs and mentioned  me and my post I made in August about
good and bad synchronizer tools.

If you go to www.aircooled_dot_net and do a search for &quot;weber&quot; - you will see at
the bottom of the page, the 2 carb tools I referred to.  I paid the $64 from
RMMW for the tool with the guage and number.  It's the tool that has a
conical looking piece of rubber on the end of it.  The other tool that is a
flat disc with the old ball and tube method is the one I hate.  It chokes
off your carb and you can't ever get a good seal.  The good one allows the
engine to breath and it doesn't cause it to stumble thereby allowing you to
make a very accurate measurement.
