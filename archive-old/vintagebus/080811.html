Subject: need distributor - late 60's

Volks of the list...

I need the following distributor, just the body and shaft, not the
rotor, cap, points, but it's got to have less than 1/16&quot; vertical play
along the main shaft. Preferably a lot less (.040&quot;). This means it has to
have those spacer washers all there on the bottom end of the shaft. I need
it to rebuild my electronic ignition. This is the distributor with vacuum
advance and the taller reddish/rust color cap and rotor.

Bosch number:  0 231 137 035
VW number:   113 905 205T   &lt;&lt;&lt; it's got to be the &quot;T&quot; version.

Thanks!
