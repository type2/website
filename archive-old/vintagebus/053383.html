Subject: Fw: Re: [VB] Tom Conner Roof racks, total bus height?



I have a 6'0&quot; Tom Connor rack - LOVE IT - and had about a couple inches
to spare at the SeaTac parking garage, which is 7'0&quot;.  Another quick plug
for Tom...  when I was working on my brakes about a week after I got it
(having already forgotten it was up there) I started rolling my bus into
the garage/basement which will take my bus, but not the rack.  The bus
stopped cold, and I thought I was rolling onto something.  Of course, it
was the rack hitting the frame of my garage door.  When I pulled the bus
back out to check out the horror, the rack was absolutely fine, as were
the driprail clamps (which are very nice looking) etc.  Anyway, Tom
Connor racks are strong.  I hauled about 350 lbs from Missoula to
Aberdeen (took me about 12 hours, including meals, rest stops, kid
breaks, etc.) on top of it and didn't feel a thing.  Come to think of it,
while I was loading that stuff up there, I was standing on top of it too,
so add on another 190lbs.

A quick word - Tom takes his racks seriously.  If you don't have him
finish it (as in it's a rush order, or something) you're going to have to
practically promise to finish it right away.  He doesn't want his racks
going around unprotected.  On that note, just primering is not
protecting.  It is not repellent.

My steel grey and wood rack sits on my '62 mouse grey and pearl white
standard, and it looks great.
