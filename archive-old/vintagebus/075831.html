Subject: Das Volkswagen Bulli: Fascist Tool or Commie Sin-Bin?

In all the cheerleading for viewpoints, variously, of Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky, I'm kinda surprised no one has mentioned the little-known TRUE 
history behind the development of the Type2.  

Of course, the basic running gear is widely believed to have been spawned as a National &quot;Socialist&quot; (really fascist, read corporatist) PR ploy, then 
resurrected postwar by the Labor Brits as workfare, only later becoming a true Aktiengesellschaft shadetree umbrella benevolent paternal organization 
in the model of Standard Oil and Enron, employing a great many Turkischer Gastarbeiters.

The bus itself is supposedly a result of the factory mule vehicle - a product of Heroic Worker Ingenuity (which has given us such boons as the 
Trabant) - admixed with a hefty dose of potential-profit-eyeing by Herr Pon, a salesman (and salesmen never sell us anything we don't need, nor do 
their minions create the need, despite the alarums of pointy-headed academes and their silly notions, such as particle physics and nukuler medicine).

With the above in mind, one would certainly argue for the Bus as a standard and exemplar of the Cryptosocialistic Laissez-Faire Venture Fascist 
Welfare State, and damn your eyes if you disagree.  However, as cogently argued on the list, the poor vehicle was adopted by a nation of overfed 
longhaired draft-dodging ingrates (who got that way primarily from cannabis, it seems, due to their rejection of Ethyl Alcohol, whose effects are more 
carefully documented).

A valid point is raised that these Bohemians (transcendentalists, pioneers, Thoreau-niks, whatever), in their rejection of Modren Culcha [salaam], 
drove around in a Machine!  What hypocrisy!  One produced by a bidness, to boot!  Resulting in all manner of subsequent annoyance to perfectly 
decent cleancut folk who want no annoyance of peace signs and dope solicitation as they go about their -- whatever they go about, we dasn't ask.  
Which therefore (and clearly) invalidates the entire so-called Counterculcha, QED.  Reductio ad fashionstatement.

The point, you ask?  Dast you?  I urge you to remember that without Taft, we'd have no Teapot Dome.  Without bidness, we'd have to find 
something other than VW buses to represent what we think of as some of the less obnoxious manifestations of Car Culcha.  We'd in fact have no 
cars.  And that would suck, because we'd be bumming rides all the time.
