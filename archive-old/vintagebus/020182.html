Also went to Prescott. Also ran hot in the 105F
ambient Arizona temp. Also ran guages- pressure and
temp. &lt;understood all of the endless discussions of
inaccuracies etc&gt;. Given that we ran at 240 F coming
out of Phoenix with 60pass Mesa cooler with fan
blowing. Big hairy dog, wife, daughter, self, under
valued Puck trailer and everything that we own bolted
inside per popular request. &lt;sigh&gt;

Untied the bailing wire holding the heater boxes wide
open at the top of &quot;the&quot; big hill aka Sunset Point
reststop. More proof that I hadn't driven a splittie
in some time. Wife just thought it was Summer time.
=)!

My family admits to being the Rubber Johnny of the
trip as my baby apparently partied all night. Baby and
Mom in the Punk trailer. Harry dog and self in the
Trophy whore bus. The crying wasn't the baby it was
the wife wishing for more sleep and less fussy baby.
The howling in the bus was just between the dog and I.
;-) woof!
Harry dog is the passive-aggressive type. Passive
until another dog comes within ten yards of the bus.
Then comes the aggression. Of course every dog owner
on VW Planet Earth was at the Prescott show. Save the
lectures, I know the REAL def'n of passive/aggressive.
Learned it from my body and paint guy. ;-)
Had intentions of chillin and studying my SQL book
&lt;exciting!~not&gt; but ended up juggling cats all day
instead. Read the same paragraph about ten times and
gave up. Was it me or did it seem like nearly every
other VW was being wrenched on. J.P.'s comments from
last week came to mind...
The drive home was white knuckled cross-winded fun
with yuppie SUVs going 100mph like they had their hair
on fire and a firehose up their- um, tailpipe. Seems
more and more like there is wisdom in Havasu!
Squealing brake issue resolved with new grease seals,
new shoes and cheap labor prior to the trip.
Kudos to the camping fun on Saturday night. It was
good to see everyone and have some laughs. &quot;That other
Katie&quot; did not fall down this trip. &lt;inside joke&gt;
Outside of Saturday night I had so much fun that it
reminded me that we'll have to take another VW trip
sometime next year.
