Subject: Steering Wheel Question 

OK thanks to the list I was finally able to take my steering wheel off. the
bearing breaker tool and a steering wheel puller did the job. My original plans
was to have my steering wheel restored. But a buddy at work has a flat4 repro gt
steering wheel with a 63bug steering wheel boss. That i can have on the
condition that it goes on my bus and not on a shelf. Does any one on the list
know if this can be done??
