&lt;&lt; Just the idea of a steel bolt in cast iron makes me think. &gt;&gt;
Hi Roger &amp; Trudi,
Brake drums are made out of cast steel not cast iron.  We have had to beat on 
too many of them with sledge hammer that would have shattered cast iron all 
too easily.  The engine cylinders on the other hand are made of cast iron and 
shatter quite readily.  VW used a solid insert to repair stripped brake drum 
lug bolt holes.   Eric&amp;Barb
