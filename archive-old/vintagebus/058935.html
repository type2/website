Subject: front end update

Hello Everyone,

Just an update on my progress, and a question.  Last week I got a machinist 
buddy to re-make a new swing lever bushing to replace the one I buggered up 
last time.  FYI, dimensions for the bushings are o.d. 1.154, I.D. 0.875 
(actually, any diameter less than 0.94, I found that a 7/8 drill bit worked 
fine), length 1.045.  There, now it's in the archive.

put in the new bushing, my machinist friend also let me borrow an adjustable 
reamer so I took my time and got the bushings just right.  Put in the pin, 
and bolted on the swing lever.  Sweet!  I measured the torsion arms again, 
right side still at 7.0 mm, left side at 5.3, round to 5.5.  Good enough for 
me.  Put the beam back on the bus, and install the reman spindles from bus 
boys with new link pins.  Man, it's coming together, and it looks good!

Now, my question.  Has anybody else had a little trouble getting the link 
pin dust covers to go on?  The diameter seems to be just a tad large.  I 
tried freezing them a bit, still no go.  I'll file the edges down a little 
today, and then put them in the freezer, and see if I can get them to go.  
Anybody have any suggestions?  I thought of putting them in a bag with some 
dry ice, thus making them even colder (and smaller).

TIA,

Mike A.
