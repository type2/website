Subject: [VB] Westy pop top

Many people paint the top, bumpers and wheels Pearl
and continue to sleep at night. I believe that the
bumpers, wheels, front emblem and poptop '65-'67 Westy
should be Siber Weiss (silver white) on a one color
Pearl camper. The subtle difference makes the Pearl
snap.

Check with Ross Harmon on the correct color of the pop
section and emblem on the single color Velvet Green
&quot;HipBus&quot;. I think that Ross' OG buses are all green
excepting the bumpers and wheels. He's &quot;the man&quot; on 
original single color green campers. You can't beat
original! =)

I did the top, wheels and bumpers Siber Weiss on the
two toned grn/white '67 Westy. The two tone has been
debated endlessly. I actually like the solid colors
better in retrospect. Not correct, but I dig that Warm
grey color that looks like a light beige-ish with an
RCH of black looking color that was on late 50's-early
60's small window buses. That Bruto/Bruno/Bluto or
whomever guy from the Idaho Bus Pilots club had a nice
camper bus with the fakey BRMs on their website that
looked to be the **** IMHO. That grey goes excellent
with the silver white bumpers/wheels.
