Subject: dual batteries and generators

Don't want to start another dual battery thread, but just wondering if my
setup with the hella dual relay and a deep cycle marine battery may have
contributed to the sudden demise of my generator/regulator.  I know I
probably did more damage myself, but before I blew the generate up (or
&quot;pulverized&quot; it,)  my initial tests after light started glowing showed that
the gen was only putting out 3 volts or so.

I will replace both when I save the cash, and am considering taking out the
relay as well.
