Subject: Repro Metal Question

As i was finishing up some areas on the 21 today, i peeled back the rubber 
for the cargo doors.  The rocker is completey solid except for the rubber 
channel and the &quot;sill?&quot;

So anyways, the middle seat mounts are different than on the 66 and i need to 
know the best source for a repro as well as for the &quot;sill?&quot; piece.  I wont 
mind buying a full rocker and just hack that piece off it they come with it.

What does the almighty list suggest?
