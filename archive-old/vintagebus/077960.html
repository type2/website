Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting reaction at a show today...

Years ago I used to think of VW's [bugs and wagons and fast backs - NEVER
buses] as &quot;disposable autos.&quot;  I have always driven a VW of some kind, ever
since I bought my first one in 1969 [beige convertible with automatic stick
shift. HORRIBLE invention that automatic stick.]  So when I would be looking
for a decent VW, there were many times I would buy a disposable one to drive
until I found what I wanted. Kinda like boyfriends I think .. sorry guys ...

&gt; People have to remember that for MOST Americans, VWs (old air-cooled
&gt; anyway) are still considered &quot;throw away cars&quot;.
