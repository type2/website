 Replaced the tranny in my '62 with a freeway flyer. (BTW - Everyone raves
 about these things, but I didn't notice much difference.  Anyone know how to
 check the gearing to confirm I got what I paid for?)  I'm fairly proficient
 in the &quot;shop,&quot; and other than wanting death over trying to get the wheel
 bearings off without a puller, the job went off OK...  Until....

get (beg borrow or buy) a tach, hook it up and drive around.   write , or get 
a friend/aquaintance/hitchhiker to write down speeds at rpms in each gear.   
such as 3K in 1st, but use at least 3 rpms in each other gear.   like 2K, 
2.5K, 3K.   dont pick mph and write down associated speeds, write down the 
rpms (maybe before you start driving), and then fill in (or get the writer to 
fill in) the speeds at those rpms.   Post these to the list, and include 
whether you have big nut or small nut boxes, and what size rims and tires you 
use, and whether the speedo is original for your bus (62) or from a later one.

if you had done the taching before the tranny switch as well, you could 
compare.  Tant pis.

 Whenever I hit a decent bump, or jerk the clutch, there is this hideous
 knock in back, reminiscent of when the nose cone mounting bolts came loose
 on my bug...  The shocks are old, could this have anything to do with it?
 What about the rubber tranny mounts on the undercarriage?  Any thoughts are
 appreciated: it's one of those noises that you know is nothing to fix now,
 but will cost you $$ in the future if you don't address.  Dig?
.......................

first I would go check that the bolts and nuts holding the tranny in and the 
ones at the RGBoxes are not loose, I personally torque the RGBox bolts to 
70-80ft lbs, no less, no more.

you really should use new rubber mounts when installing the tranny, 
especially the front one, which is a hassle to change, the back two you just 
have to pull the motor, pretty much.   crawl under bus to check to make sure 
they are not cracked and fubared, if they are you must replace them.  NOW.   
or things will bend and break in your shift linkage and it will be a bigger 
hassle. ( I have seen not only the front shift guide broken, the front shift 
rod messed up, and the rear coupler messed up, but the hockey stick in the 
tranny bent and the nose cone cracked. )  One way of checking this is to lay 
hands on the fan shroud, and pull it back.   If the engine will tilt back, 
this mean the front of the tranny will tilt up and the front mount is broken. 
 At least it was all apart recently.  If the engine does not tilt back, this 
means that the front mount is securing the front of the tranny to the bus, 
which is it's purpose and it should do.
