Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

I'm running a 009 for a Compufire DX-IX distributorless and I get a blur of
numbers when I time it all in. Can someone tell me what's up? Thanks,

Mike

&gt;
&gt; i agree, and that's what my longtime vw friends tell me... but they run
&gt; 009s coz they're cheap and they consider almost any dizzy you pick up at a
&gt; swap meet worn out beyond adequate performance.
&gt;
&gt; i'm running a cast iron 019 only coz outta TEN dizzys i had on hand, it was
&gt; the only one to hold a stable curve and not 'chatter' at speed.
&gt;
&gt; one of my long-term projects is rebuilding some dizzys, but once the vac
&gt; can is gone, fergit it... i have been finding 'nla' for many of the early
&gt; ones. anyone open one and re-diapghram one? didn't we have a debate not too
&gt; long ago about how far is TOOOO far in the rebuild world :)
