Hi all!  This is Sarah.  (of captain america underwear fame... thanks
Erin!)  Hey, just wondering if anyone at BNNTA might know who owned that
freshly painted cream over red Westy????? That guy had a sweet ride!!!
If I can recall correctly, it was sitting next to a very alluring white
over red '67 deluxe and a delicious little green single-cab I would
GLADLY trade my captain america underwear for.  Oh and I seem to
remember a fellow named Isaiah (?) (could be wrong on the name but I
think that's right) with a white over green bus that he stole from some
old lady,  stumbling over there now and again with a Humpback in one
hand and a glass of some really interesting looking Kool-aid in the
other.  Sound familiar?  

Sarah
