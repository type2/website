Cool with water eh? Mount up front maybe? Maybe not. I am responding to Bob
Hoover but I thought others might enjoy or annoy.


The cooling of water for the small subaru engine, or better still (sorry
Bob) the GTI VW (yep vw IS a better match to vw vintage IMHO) is a bit of
work. The water cooled engine of our present day needs very little cooling
relative to the big cousins of big blocks past.
This is obvious be the on/off cooling and plastic fans. 

Where shall we put it? We all (ok no very few of us want to know) want to
know. My 69 has the cooler for oil mounted right about where you would
expect a second battery to be. The metal is cut out of the bus, a rabbit
radiator and fan is mounted there, and oil is plumbed in.
In the case of the radiator with water in a early model bus, there is less
room to work with, but it still is feasible. Cut out the lower section,
mount a radiator higher, apply ductwork, a fan, and there you go. Hot air is
pushed out, just like it should be.
