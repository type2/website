&lt;&lt; I got Castrol Hypoy C SAE 80W-90.  It says it exceed API GL-5 performance 
specifications.
Hi John,
Hmm, that might be bad.  You want to use a tranny oil rated GL-4 as near to 
90 as possible unless you live in a artic climate.  GL-5 rated oil is 
according to tranny rebuilders bad for the brass syncros in the tranny.

&lt;&lt; I got 4 quarts.  Is that enough?&gt;&gt;
That will do, but it would not hurt to get at least one more quart as a spare 
in case you need to top the tranny or steering box in the near future.

&lt;&gt;
Good, it works best if the oil is warmed up before trying to get in the 
tranny.  Warm the oil bottle/s in the sun, or if nessesary in a bucket of hot 
water.

&lt;&lt; Drain the center section first and then the RGB's? &gt;&gt;
Correct.  Plus check the bottom of the drain pan after draining each section. 
 Look for steel shrapnel of bigger than a pin head and the more there is the 
more you should consider rebuilding the reductions, and/or tranny center 
section.  

&lt;&lt;Do the drain plugs ever become stuck or crack or anything?&gt;&gt;
All of the plugs are tapered, so do not over torque them back in, or enjoy 
replacing cracked housings.

&lt;&lt; I shoudn't be so nervous about it I guess. &gt;&gt;
No.  Unless you are one of those who still can not remember the old saying 
&quot;Righty tighty.  Lefty loosey.   Eric&amp;Barb
