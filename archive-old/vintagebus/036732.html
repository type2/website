&lt;&lt; but I didnt think the fuel pump would allow one way siphining... anyone? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Yes and no.  The affect is not caused by siphoning, but rather gravity and
the fact that the valving in the fuel pump is only one way not a shut off
device.  The fuel tank in all 1955-79 buses except the single cab truck are
higher than the carburator so if you have a fuller than half tank it can
drain through the fuel pump, float shut off valve and the brass venting tube
in the carb.  Resulting in gas dripping around the butterfly valve on into
the engine and from the throttle shaft into the engine compartment.  Been
there done that!   Eric&amp;Barb
