Subject: Which Year Gas Tank Fits??
Message-ID: &lt;7lj03n$nrff_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi Everyone,

I'm considering replacing the stock fuel tank in my '66 E-Z Camper with a larger tank from a baywindow bus to increase my range on long trips.  What I needed to know is what year(s) of bus has a compatible tank with my splitty and what is the capacity of these tanks??  Also, what parts are necessary from the donor bus for the conversion??  Thanks for the help.
