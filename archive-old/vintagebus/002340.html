Subject: '67 &amp; adjusting brakes

Hi folks -
I have a question for y'all
I recently did a brake adjustment for the first time on my '67 Deluxe.
Since my Vw shop manual was missing, I chose to follow good ol' John M's
directions.
Everything was progressing as explained (which is pretty hard considering
that &quot;closest part of the tire&quot; bit - why not just say up/down?)
Anyway, I started at the passenger rear and worked my way around -
everything was working just like he said... until I got to the passenger
front which was the exact opposite of what it should have been.

I was curious about this since it doesn't seem that the brake components can
be
installed backwards - can someone have swapped in a driver-side front
wheel? Or just put the bottom spindle where the top should be? Is that
possible?

Another question -
I noticed that as the star turned (in the non-functioning, seemingly
upside-down passenger -side brakes) there was a significant hollow &quot;clack&quot;
noise as the star turned - all of the spindles were replaced (according to
p.o. repair invoices - which called them cylinders) during a complete brake
system overhaul in '95. All the other stars were greasy and made no
'clacking' as I turned them... is it significant that the one that isn't
working is bone dry?

would like to hear your input - thanks,
Melissa
