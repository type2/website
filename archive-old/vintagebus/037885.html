heh,  I cant beleive you even can ask that question?  Theres is an
undeniable stigma that will always be part of the vw bus.  Peace Love,
happiness, Karma, good will to all men, blah blah..
Back in 93 I hitch hiked  and hopped freightt trains around the country for
a year.  Now during the east coast part of the journey, i remember being
picked up so much by buses that it always seemed like a guaranteed ride.
I'd be sitting under an overpass for hours on end just watching the cars
whiz buy and suddenly...  put put put put put... and away we go.  So much
that i would get overly excited about seeing them.  Now out here on the east
coast where im from I can count all the buses in my city on both my hands
and almost all the owners of them are throwback deadheads or newschool kids
waiting for the next phish tour.  On the west coast theres buses all over
the damn place!!!  :)  So, to relate the story together...  I hop of a
freight and land myself in Seattle.  I probably stayed theres for about a
month before it was time to head to portland.  Once out on the highway i put
my trusty thumb up and no more than a minute later i see the savior vw comin
on the horizon.  Im thinkin, Wow this is gonna be great...  nope.  I proceed
to sit on the side of the highway being passed by more buses in 6 hours than
i think Ive ever seen in my life on the east coast.  I felt betrayed.  I
finally did get a ride eventually by a nice woman in an old volvo.  Almost
got to the state line too.  I wish i had, cause not only was my next ride
NOT a bus again, but a police car to the station.  (Hitchhiking is very very
illegal in washington it turns out.)  As for the freak in the bus, he
probably wanted the nicest looking podium that exuded the most Peace Love,
happiness, Karma, and good will to men, to damn everyone to hell from.
alas, he too fell for it like i did. =)

Shawn:

I had a similar problem with cat piss. Wipe everything down with diluted
Simple Green and keep the windows open for a few days.

To the larger issue here, why do certain people gravitate to old buses?
Twice now I've had panhandlers walk right past several employed-looking
people to tap me for change. How do they know I'm an easy mark? How do
they
know I'm not just another Seattle prick who got this bus from the shop
that's tuning his Porsche?

List
I just came in from cleaning the bus.................. for earlier today
we
went to a Mariners game at Safeco field where Seattle beat San Diego 6
to 4.
When we walked out of the stadium (wife son and I) We found a crowd
gathered
around the bus, assuming it was the usual crowd of memory lane nostalgia
trippers I didn't think much at first. Then all of  a sudden some long
haired Jesus freak (I can say this because up until about two years ago
I
had hair hanging down below my belt)  pops his head up from the open sun
roof and starts rambling on to the crowd about some type of  eternal
damnation fate and that we were all going to hell. Walking closer to the
bus
I was at a loss for how I was going to get him out of there. My first
thought was to drag him out by his hair and put the fear of MY GOD in to
his
life. But then looking over at my family I realized that this was not a
good
idea. Instead I decided to so see if he would stop talking so I could
address him and ask him to exit the vehicle (don't call me a pansy).
After
about 5 minutes of his belligerent BS I was forced to locate a cop and
have
him removed. The damn thing is, he was doped up pretty good and had
pissed
his pants. So as you can guess all the way home my bus smelled like...
well
piss.
when I got home I removed the interior and washed the bus down. I
scrubbed
the seats and mats, but still can sort of smell it. Does any one have a
good
solution to kill this stench. Also If any one has a locking door handle
driver's side for a 63 they want to sell it would be appreciated.
