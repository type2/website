Subject: Barndoor Baja?

Hi,

This falls under the &quot;what were they thinking&quot; category.

I won an eBay auction for a pair of reduction boxes, axle tubes and 
shafts. Apparently, the set up was put together for a baja that was 
never finished. The tubes were fitted to adapters that allowed the 
reduction boxes lay on their side. This came with all the gears 
(magnafluxed) and bearings, etc. I thought maybe I'd save some money 
if/when I get to the reduction boxes and find them all rusted to heck - 
that I'd have some extra parts on hand.

When I got the boxes, they were wrapped in very yellow newspaper dated 
from 1979 - so obviously in someone's shed for several years. I started 
looking at part numbers:

211-501-235 and 211-501-236

Uh oh, these are bit older than what I'm going to be able to use... So 
I take a look at the inside halves of the reduction boxes: 
211-501-251A. Well at least everything matches.

Then I pictured a guy who wanted to slam his barndoor. He wonders what 
he's going to do with his reduction boxes and has a marvelous idea - 
he'll build himself a baja with his split ragtop. I guess we'll never 
know.

I put pictures up on Everett's site:
