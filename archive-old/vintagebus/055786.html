Subject: Re: [VB] stock restos are easy...My bus, my reply

&gt; Hi gang,
&gt; Does all of this have a point?  Who gives a &amp;$#%* which one is easiest.
&gt;
&gt; Next is someone going to say &quot;My dad can beat up your dad&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; Get a life . . .

I was a bit awed by the comment &quot;stock restos are easy&quot;. And to think all
these years I've been restoring my crewcab,  I was doing something that was
&quot;easy?&quot;. This fella must be quite a man.
