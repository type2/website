Subject: re:where to look for leaks

i think the easiest way to find leaks is to clean everything as much as
possible and then see where the oil starts flowing.

i have found some around the oil pressure thingy tat screws into the
case(mines was loose)

If you see oil kind of coming over the top of the case on the drivers
side-probably leaking oil cooler seals.

If it is coming from the front of the engine-then it is probably the seal
around where the engine hits the transmission(somewhere in the
flywheel/clutch area) i forget exactly where that seal is right now...

oh yeah, how much of a leak do you have??
