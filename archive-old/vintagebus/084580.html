Subject: Re: failure notice

Hi.   I make the spice rack that hangs on the door of an SO-42 westy.
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=177223
They are a bit fussy to make.

Most of the other cabinets are not too tricky to find used.  Early bay ones are 
very similar to the SO-42... they will fit, the bed is better made and more 
comfortable, but the long cabinet on the side would need to be cut shorter or 
it'll stick into the cargo door opening.

Then again, you could design your own camper kit customised to fit your needs.

Does anyone know where I can find templates for Westfalia cabinets for a 65
splitty?
