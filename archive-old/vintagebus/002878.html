Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Window
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Actually, the truck rear windows are shaped like non-deluxe Barndoor rear
windows through 65 at least. I'm not sure if 66 and 67 had the big one or
just 67, don't recall for certain and don't have the lit here at work. Wider
at the bottom, not the top. The truck ones work fine for Barndoors and vice
versa from what I understand, they just have the wrong logo.

&gt; No, not a Hitchcock question.  I'm wondering if all pre 64 rear (small)
&gt; windows are the same (back to 55).  Are there bus/truck differences?
&gt; The back one in my truck is scratched (by me possibly when I took off
&gt; the hideous window tint) and I'd like to replace it eventually.  The one
&gt; I have is wider at the top (it seems) than at the bottom.  Are they all
&gt; like that.   Thanks.
