just an  update, 
pulled the cargo door handle and took it to my friendly local  locksmith,  
yes 
it was &quot;T&quot; code

He has a blank ,cut it to  code, was amazed it was 2 sided.....and it  
worked, 

Came home ,  put it in the ignition and it fits !   YEAH

now to drain the  gas tank + change the oil and see if this beast will start  
up after  sitting 20 years......

sweet!!!!
 
you should think about pulling the drain nut/spout off the tank and  
cleaning/ examining/ if torn replacing the mesh sock that goes in there.   and new 
fuel line  :)
 
just let it run for a while, and check to see how dirty the oil gets.   When 
I started up my 67 riviera (had been sitting) the new oil got real dirty in  
10 minutes of idling.    I changed it again.   and  again as soon as it got 
dirty (drove to the store and back ~ 4 miles)... and  again 40 miles later 
(dirty) ... and... then ~200 later it was  dirty...and...
