Some advice on possible problems is all I can offer
from the left coast.  A bad coil will burn out points, 
along with a bad condenser, and possible bad grounding
of the those components.  Someone put in a coil that
needed a separate resistor rather than the correct one
that has an internal resistor, it too, burned out points in
about 200 miles.

Another weird solution to rough then dying, if the points 
are NOT burned, is fuel filter.  It was a Vanagon, but it 
might be the case.  After filling with a tank of cheapo,
alcohol laden gas from Beacon or ARCO, I got similar
symptoms.  Replaced the fuel filter and things went well
for another 200 miles.  It wasn't crud in the tank, but something
that stuck to the filter from the cheap gas.

Good luck.

He's got the '60 Panel Van/Bus.  HE ran rough once, stopped roadside,
had
help replacing the points and then was driving fine to 3200 RPM and then
the tachometer started bouncing and Sparky died.
Towed him to Cape May Point,and his parents' house late Sunday night-
Replaced points a 2nd time, started right away, drove a few hundred
yards
and died again.
