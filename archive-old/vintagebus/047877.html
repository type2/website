What is the problem here?  I mean do they work?    Are you feeling like you 
really want a matched pair?   Seems to me that many buses get mismatched 
headlights, or bits of them, but that does not mean they aren't functional.   
If yours dont work, take a test light to the wires- the problem tends to be a 
bad bulb or in the wires, more than the buckets.

 hello everyone,
 
 Still trying to figure out what in the world PO of my bus did with the 
 headlights.  Originally, my dad was helping me with the bus one day, and I 
 asked him to take the headlights off for me.  I wanted to take advantage of 
 free help while I had it, so I had him take them off while I was doing 
 something else.  Consequently, I didn't get a good hard look at the 
 headlights until I took them out of the bag for a look last night.  First 
 off, the buckets do not appear to be a matched pair.  Stamped on the back of 
 the buckets, on the inside side (imagine the bus looking at you cross eyed, 
 the numbers are where the eye would be looking) there are 2 part numbers, 
 one started with a &quot;113&quot; and then the number below was a &quot;211&quot; numbers.  I 
 didn't write down the numbers (doh!) but I remember that they ended in 
 &quot;037A&quot; and &quot;037B&quot; which leads me to believe that the buckets are left and 
 right set.
 
 However, the cut outs for the parking lights are not in the same place on 
 the two buckets.  One of them is more forward (FIF) than the other.
 Next strange occurance, on the headlight rings, one of them has adjusting 
 screws at around 2 and 7 o'clock, and the other has the adjusting screws at 
 7 and 10 o'clock.    Both of the buckets have been &quot;fitted&quot; with sylvania 
 halogen sealed beam assemblies with sheet metal screws and the like, and the 
 headlight rings have been painted black.  Ugly, ugly, ugly.
 
 First off, can anyone out there help me identify what I have here?  I have a 
 sneaking suspicion that it is probably a mish-mash symphony of type I and 
 type II parts.
 
 Second, and the answer to this question makes question #1 irrelevant, Who 
 has the best deal on complete headlight assemblies?  i'm thinking it's time 
 to chuck the nasty ones and start afresh.  Euro spec or american spec it 
 doesn't matter.
 
 TIA, &gt;&gt;
