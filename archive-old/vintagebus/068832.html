Subject: Re: Westy tent plastic clips - what to use if broken?

From: Oldscholvw_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;1/3 of the plastic clips that hold it up on the poles are broken, the &quot;rubber band&quot;  loops are fine....
&gt;are new plastic  ones available ?  or is there a hardware store item that will work ?

Note that the plastic clips are not used to clip to the pole, but through the grommet tabs on the tent after looping the rubber bands over the pole.  I 
didn't know this until I saw a manual.  Pic at http://www.jsclark_dot_net/vw/loaves.html (see detail drawing of tent in erected position).

I just bought some similar-sized metal S-hooks at the hardware store and keep 'em with the stakes.  It would be easy enough to take something like 
that and mount it permanently to the rubber bands -- although I guess the orig were plastic to keep them from poking holes in the fabric when folded.
