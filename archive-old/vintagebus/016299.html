Ellis needed to escape from LA, er, I mean, Phoenix
&lt;same thing&gt; and hit the road.
Stayed home with my little family until Saturday
afternoon. Darned near emptied my garage into the '63
Sleazy camper and headed to the Flat Four Fetish show
in Prescott,AZ. The '63 EZ camper looked like it was
straight axled and drove like I had the e-brake set
due to the load, the elevation and the climbing
between Phoenix and Northern Arizona. It performed
like the champ that it is...
Camped Saturday evening with a few of the listees and
families. It was a total relief to leave the daily
pressures and share a few laughs with friends. I have
no interior in the camper at present. I threw in the
pad that sits over the engine bay. Slept on the little
pad quasi-fetal position with feet hanging all over
the lumpy parts stash. Beat the heck out of sitting
upright in the walkthrough seat of a 67Westy thrasher
as was done at last Summer's Colorado shows... =)
Sunday arrived and had a great day at the swaps. Sold
my buns off-pimping my stash in some cases for pennies
on the dollar. I was the parts pimp and gave a few
deals and gained a few bux. This accomplished the dual
goal of creating space for the baby's room and a touch
of cash flow. Lots of laughs and wonderful weather.
Specially appreciated the warped gay amatuer Billy
Joel/Captian and Tinelle concert in the middle of the
show. It was like having Marilyn Manson on the Pat
Robertson program. Poor guy got eaten alive by some
rowdies like a fresh mouse in a snakes' cage.
Thanks to the Prescott tribe &lt;Flat Four Fetish&gt; for a
very enjoyable time.
The daddy in me was happy to return home and see the
girls.
