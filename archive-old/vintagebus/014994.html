Well, that stuff that you call cabinets don't come close to even look
like cabinets. Someone just used some kind of paneling and some 1X2 and
2X2 strips to come-up with something that looks like sort of cabinets.
I'll have inside pictures soon.

&gt;hey there,
&gt;
&gt;before you decide that those panels/cabinets are home made, check out 
&gt;some
&gt;other sundial camper conversions...
&gt;
&gt;they tend to have that home made look to em... so you may end up 
&gt;trashign
&gt;the original stuff... the sundials looked kinda different than the
&gt;westies... by quite a bit!
&gt;
&gt;peas,
&gt;
