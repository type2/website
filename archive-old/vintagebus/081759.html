Subject: info wanted about 1500 &amp; 1600 split screen bus scripts

Hi Volks,
When VW introduced the 1500 in the 1963 bus as an option there seems to  have 
been a 1500 script offered to be put on the engine lid or in some 1964  and 
later cases on the rear wider hatch.
  We have seen dealer photos of the 1964 VW line with each VW in  the picture 
having the front license plate showing the size of engine.  IE  the bug with 
1300, the type 3 with 1500, and the bus with a 1600.  Does  anybody know what 
country might have had the 1600 as a standard or  option as early as 1964?!?!
  The reason we ask is that over the many years we found  only two 1600 bus 
scripts that are exactly the same as the 1500 script,  just the &quot;5&quot; changed 
into a &quot;6&quot; of course.  Just recently  we found a stash of NOS 1600 scripts!
