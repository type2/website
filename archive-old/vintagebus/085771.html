Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Leaks

The torque value was gotten from a early bus manual that I have. I think it's a British book and says case nut can be torqued from 24 to 26 lbft. There is the one case nut just above the oil pump that is not a through bolt the doen't get tight at all. The bolt just gets longer as the nut is tightend.

Hey Seth    Where did you get this torque valve from??   type 1 oil pump nuts  14 ft lbs   type 4 oil pump nuts  22 ft lbs     Now I don't think this is your oil leak unless one of the studs stripped out. from over torqueing it.   !3 mm case nuts 18 ft lbs and large center case nuts 25 ft lbs   later  Mark Dearing
