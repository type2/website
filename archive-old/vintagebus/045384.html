&lt;&lt; I think that happened to me. Lately the clutch hasn'f felt right and
 yesterday I started getting throwout bearing noise so today I am pulling
 the engine out of the 68. That sucker just is not coming. I hate to pry at
 the engine/trans joint but I can't think what else to do. Suggestions
 appreciated. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
First of course you should check for anything you might have forgotten to
remove to release your engine.  Then you block the jack under the engine from
rolling forward, put your VW in first and release the E-brake.  If you are on
a hill make sure you block the bus from rolling compleately away and/or have
someone man the brakes just in case.  Then rotate the engine clockwise with a
wrench and this will make the VW move forward and hopfully seperate the engine
from the tranny.   Eric &amp; Barb
