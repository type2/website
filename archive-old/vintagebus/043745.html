&gt;My 1960 DC 611005 built (according to m plate 16/05/0) has the one piece
&gt;gates, I belive these to be original, it also has the high hindge wedge
&gt;things.  [...] Also the dating chart says this bus was an April bus but
&gt;the build date shows 16th of May.

A book I have which probably is derived from Progressive Refinements
(source of Everett Barnes' numbers) further narrows this to

 6 May  1960  605 706
 1 June 1960  614 456  (clashes with PR number of 615 192 per Everett)

Depending on whether these numbers came off the line early or late
in the day, and assuming they worked 5 days a week, there are 17 to
19 working days to make the 8751 (or 9487) Buses above.  This is a
rate of 461 to 515 (499 to 558) Buses per day, putting your Bus 
10 to 11 (ditto) working days after 6 May, or sometime just before
or after the weekend of 21-22 May 1960.

&gt;Does the M code plate get stamped upon completion of
&gt;the build or during?? or is it when ready for delivery?

There has been a lot of discussion about this.  I wonder if perhaps
the M-code plates were stamped more than once?  For example, the
plates could be stamped with option codes and color codes at the
&quot;beginning&quot; of the line and the plate would travel with the Bus,
so the line workers could install the proper options as it went
along.  Sometime before the paint booth, it got stamped with the
day (and maybe the chassis number if not done already) and installed.

Why are we (or, &quot;Why am I&quot;) obsessed with this stuff?

Matt
