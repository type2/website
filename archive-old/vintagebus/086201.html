Subject: Re: [T2] Mexican longblock questions

Gene Berg used to sell a kit of plastic parts that allowed one to  
measure the combustion chamber volume and thereby calculate the  
compression ratio.  At a local VW parts/repair place they used to  
sell a set of pistons for a Type 2 that had a dished out top.

&gt; Here is something that is a bit different regarding these guys. I  
&gt; have an engine in my 66 with about 80k trouble free miles. I  
&gt; purchased this from aircooled_dot_net a few years ago and have been  
&gt; tickled pink with it. I know from experience with this engine and a  
&gt; lot of here-say that it runs a low CR. As I am comtemplating what a  
&gt; rebuild will perhaps entail I started to wonder if anyone has done  
&gt; any real measuring on the internals. Specifically has anyone  
&gt; checked the volume of the Combustion chamber, or happened to  
&gt; measure a typical deck height. The general thought seems to be that  
&gt; dished pistons are used in this motor, but can anyone confirm this?  
&gt; From some searches on the web I could find nothing specific, other  
&gt; than aircooled seems to offer a head upgrade (which if you guys  
&gt; know the answers that would be great) and for obvious reasons have  
&gt; at least seen what the stock setup seems to be.
