I have NEW OEM Mexican, (VW Factory de Mexico) duel port tin, but the
problem is that it doesn't have the little V tin to divert the air flow like
the OG ones have, the fit is excellent, but like I said it doesn't have the
V piece in it, I don't know how this would affect engine cooling so I would
prefer OG, but it would work in a pinch and it does fit. Same tin used on
the new Type 1 beetles built in Mexico. Also available soon Brand New
Mexican (OEM VW de Mexico) doghouse shrouds and associated pieces, again the
same as on the new Type 1 beetles built in Mexico.

ps. These parts I've been told are made off the original German dies.

I agree with George.  I bought some new tin and was very displeased.  I 
didn't even use it.  I went out and found some old tim, brazed the few
cracks 
and cleaned it up.  The new is so thin you can bend it with your fingers.
