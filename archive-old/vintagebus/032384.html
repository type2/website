&gt;I guess I'm somewhat sensitive to this issue, since I
&gt;recently have had problems within my local VW club,
&gt;  We are a chapter under the aegis of Southeastern
&gt;VW Club, which is an all-inclusive club, from KdF's to
&gt;Eurovans. Last year we supported a show sponsored by
&gt;the local bus club, which was air-cooled VW's only.
&gt;One of our prominent water-cooled members has
&gt;indicated that he will not re-join the club, since we
&gt;supported that show, and he's tired of the opinions of
&gt;several of our members that &quot;wasserwagens don't
&gt;count,&quot; which were apparently expressed during our
&gt;local club show, which was all-inclusive. Thus, I run
&gt;into this type of argument all the time, and have to
&gt;sort of swallow my personal opinions.

As the promoter of the show John is referring to, the Georgia
Vintage VW Show, which Peach State Transporters started
back in the early '90s I want to respond with my opinion.  We
have always promoted the show as a &quot;Vintage VW&quot; show, and
unless I am wrong, there are no watercooled VWs that are
considered vintage.

There are *TONS* of VW shows now because everyone and
his brother wants to promote one.  In my opinion, the effect of
having a show scheduled for every weekend ends up watering
down the quality of all the shows.

Our show is the ONLY show in Georgia out of a half dozen or
so that is Vintage VW (air-cooled only) and I think that is a
big draw for our show.  We always end up with about 100 cars
in our show, which is more than any other VW show in GA.
That tells me that the people WANT an air-cooled only show.
The other thing that gives our show an identity is it is a show
marketed to DRIVERS.  Our motto is, &quot;If you can drive it, we
want to see it!&quot;  No more that 5 cars out of 90 showed up last
year on a trailer, &amp; I like those percetages.

There are at least 5-6 other shows in GA that allow water-cooled
cars and have water-cooled classes, so I think their needs are
being met by the other shows.

Kathy Jacobs of the SEVWC offered to help with our 7th annual
show last May and I was grateful for her help.  She mentioned
she had heard grumblings from a few water-cooled people and I
offered her a compromise.  I told her that if members of the
SEVWC wanted to set up a club display, I would allow water-
cooled VWs to be displayed with the club display.  I also made
the offer to let members of PST with Vanagons to display them.
No trophy classes for the water-cooled or Vanagons, but they
could be in club displays inside the show.

Traditionally I have done this show all on my own and fronted all
the money for the show on my own.  It is a major pain in the ass
to put a medium-sized show on all by yourself.  I am very thankful
to have had help from both John Cloonan and Kathy Jacobs this
year.  I hope to have their help next year as well, but I think this
one show needs to remain air-cooled only, as it has traditionally
been part of the identity of the show.  If their needs were not
being met elsewhere I would re-consider...  but there are shows
out there to suit everyone's needs.

PS, John, if you would schedule a meeting that did not coincide
        with a VW show out of town I was attending, I would show
        up!  ;)

PPS, Peach State Transporters meets the 1st Wednesday night
        of every month at Maui Taco in Decatur, GA.  EVERYONE
        is welcome to attend (no matter what you drive!)
