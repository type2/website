Subject: [VB] '71 Wiper problem
Message-ID: &lt;19991111182605.18786.rocketmail_at_web1801.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I now have intermittant wipers. Why!

I guess it can only be the switch or the motor. Which is the most
likely??

Is it possible to buy the armiture and any other parts to rebuild the
motor, or am I
looking at a reman'd motor if that is the problem?

Thanks
