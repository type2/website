Subject: Re: [VB] 'BENTVW' ... sad story

Holy Crap!  That sucks a big one man.  I'm sorry.  I do have a question, do
the outriggers come apart or are they just one piece?  If they come apart,
perhaps you could take them apart and put them back together so that they
point up instead of down, and then maybe you could use that to fix it.  If
it worked pushing down on the trailer, then it may work pushing up on
something that doesn't move to fix it.

Now, there is a one inch gap between the
&gt; top of the bed and the cab with no gap at the bottom!!!!!!!!!!    We
called
&gt; it a night.
