Subject: Original Bus information
&gt;Reply-To: &quot;Brent Jarvi&quot; &lt;applhead_at_amdyne_dot_net&gt;
&gt;
&gt;hello All
&gt;
&gt;Several months ago I sent a letter to the guys at VW in Germany in 
hopes
&gt;to find out about my beloved buss's info, whatever is out there.  Well
&gt;today I got a response.  Not the response I was looking for.
&gt;
&gt;Here it is word for word.
&gt;
&gt;Dear Mr. Jarvi
&gt;Thank you for your correspondence.
&gt;We are not in the position to respond to the contents at this time but
&gt;like to
&gt;acknowledge receipt.  Please regard this message as an interim reply.
&gt;We will contact you as soon as possible.  Thanks you for your patience.
&gt;Yours sincerely
&gt;Volkswagen Customer Relations.
&gt;
&gt;Is this just a blow off.  Or will they actually get back to me.  Has
&gt;anyone else gotten a letter simulate to this?
&gt;
.  Has anyone else gotten this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Brent
