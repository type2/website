Subject: '65 front wheel bearing race

I'm replacing the bearings on the front wheels of my '65.  There's a 
race pressed into the outer side that I can remove with a punch and 
hammer.  For the inner race- which is pressed into the brake drum hub, 
it looks like I don't have the same kind of access to the back side. 
 There's two notches, but they don't appear to be all the way through to 
the inner race.  How do I remove the inner race?

Thanks in advance!
