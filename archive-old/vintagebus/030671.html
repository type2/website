Subject: End Play

Hellllo,
I'm having a difficult time deciding what to do here.  I built up my 
engine and its *almost* done (top end rebuild basically) and I just need 
to slap on the carbs and the breast tin.  I went out today and bought a 
dial indicator to check my end play and am unsure of the results.  This 
engine was rebuilt about 50,000 miles ago (I have receipts to verify 
thanks to the PO's!) and as some of you may remember i got a washer in 
the #1 cylinder back in the fall and just decided to do a top end 
rebuild on the beast.  Well I checked the end play and the dial 
indicator tells me that I have between .007&quot; and .008&quot; of play.  Bentley 
says that it should be within 003&quot; and .005&quot; with a wear limit of 
.006&quot;.  What should I do?  Should I tear the beast back down again and 
get the shortblock rebuilt or should I just shim it?  If I were to shim 
it how long may I expect it to last?  I realize its just a band aid, but 
I want to drive my bus, but yet I don't want the thought of that looming 
over my head, unless it really isn't that bad.  The engine ran wonderful 
before I took it out, but I got that washer in the #1 cyl some how when 
I was replacing PR tube seals just after I got back from BNNTA last fall 
and I thought I would just &quot;freshen&quot; it up.

Well, what to do what to do?
Opinions anyone?

Thanks,
Isaiah
