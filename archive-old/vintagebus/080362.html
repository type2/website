Subject: RE: [VB] bus dies a lot.

Josh, I have been rebuilding carbs since 28 PIC was stock and they are
not such a mystery. Even without your Bentleys to show you the blow
diagram you can still get around with some common tools. Since you say
you have a SP I assume you have a 30 PICT-1. Doesn't matter all that
much since most all of the carbs for the VW aircooled are quite simular.

I would start off with gathering your basic tools. You will need a flat
blade screw driver and a 13mm wrench for the basic look. The 13mm wrench
is to remove the main jet cover and you can either remove the whole top
of the carb first and then the main jet through the hole or just the
main. I like to pop the top to check for debris and water. I recently
had a problem with some kid in the neighborhood adding a little water to
my gas tank. I too couldn't idle and had to keep pumping on the gas
pedal to keep it going and even then it would die. Ended up draing the
tank and blowing the fuel line and adding a fuel filter before the fuel
pump and before the carb.

Anyway, I have started a page to put down some experience over the last
30 years. It's far from complete, but you may be able to scape up som
info there.
