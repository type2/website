The soda won't do anything harmful to bare metal chemically and will dissolve quickly in water. It's best to blow it out then wash it out because there's paint dust with the soda that won't dissolve. It'll retain moisture in the nooks and crannies where rust likes to live. 
IMO, soda blasting is the best. The original grinder marks could be seen around the seams and could read the model number hand written on the seat bulkhead. I've got some pictures somewhere.
