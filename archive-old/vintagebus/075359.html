Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

&gt; That said, I'll step up and say if I had to do it over I'd of spent the
&gt; money for a good TIG welder.  Then I could do stainless, aluminum, and
&gt; very clean steel welds with almost NO clean up or grinding.  The next
&gt; one for me will be a TIG.

..but have you /used/ a TIG?  You might want to try it before you buy
it...it's an entirely different experiance.

(adjust voltage with your foot, maintain proper electrode-to-work distance
with one hand, feed the rod in with your other, and move both hands along
your work at a steady pace...did I mention the water-cooled electrode?)


I'll stick with a MIG for most of my work, and fall back to a stick for
the big stuff.
