&lt;&lt; Nope, nothing in the fan.  Checked the bus again this morning , both
 lights turn on when I turn the key to the frst notch.  Turn the key back
 then start the engine . Starts right up. lights go   out.  Drive the bus
 for a bit then the oil light comes on!!!!!  Time is at 10 deg. Ahhhhh!!
 __&gt;

so your motor gets very hot and then the oil light comes on, right?  You had 
said it was too hot to touch, right?  Does not pass the spit test?  spit on 
motor- if it sizzles rapidly it is too hot.

How was it running before you tuned it up?   How long have you had the bus?  
You may want to go through the tune up procedure again and make sure the 
valves aren't too tight etc.  What size motor and what kind of cooler?  are 
your fresh air tubes secure and the connections from them to the heater boxes 
and all that?
