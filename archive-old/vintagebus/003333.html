This is the best idea in areas where there are other splities around. Here
in Stillwater I have the only one. There are a few bays and a vanagon or
three.

I have used the measurements in the Bentley (section A. Body, General) The
measurements stare on A21, Replacing Body Parts.

&lt;&lt; I saw Thom's idea about pushing it out with the scissor jacks, but if I
&gt; attempt this, how far do I go???  &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; Best to just borrow a friends split screen of simular year and just push
out
&gt; the damage in yours while using the friends bus as a template.   Eric&amp;Barb
