&gt;&gt; Not sure if this is in any of the galleries, but follow the link...

&gt; 
&gt; Some of the stats are impressive: top end of 70+ and &quot;much quicker&quot;
&gt; acceleration than stock.

Extra benefit - Conversations at highway speeds
  Some aren't: 49 mile range.
&gt; 
&gt;The range meets my needs most every day.  If I am going to need more range, I
can plug in at work,for free!  A recharge takes three and a half hours, or
less for a partial charge (faster chargers are available but pricey).  I'm
currently working on a compact propane fired aux. power unit for the
occasional long distance trip.  Its small enough to leave in the corner of
the garage when not needed.  The bus has been on the road for about a year
and working very well.  BTW, Matt, I used your 6v to 12v conversion
information from the web; worked great, thanks.
