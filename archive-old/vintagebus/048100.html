Is there a difference in inside and outside diameter between a 6 volt and a
12 volt starter bushing? I replaced a steel bushing with a copper one, and I
was surprised at how easily the old bushing came out, and the new one
slipped in, however, I did it in part to alleviate a dragging starter, and
the symptoms didn't change. The starter that spins quickly in my 64 vert,
drags in my 66 bus.

yes, the inner diameter of the bushing is different.  Also the hole for the
bushing in the trans is different depending on whether it came as a 6V or 12V
unit when new, so there are 6V into 6V, 12V into 12V, 6V into 12V, and 12V
into 6V bushings.

Check the voltage getting to the starter in your bus.    Clean your battery
connections, and I am sure you already made sure the starter connections were
shiny when you installed it.
