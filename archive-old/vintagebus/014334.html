&gt; Yesterday, a coworker asked me how many miles I've
&gt; got
&gt; on my bus. 232,000 I proudly told him. &quot;Wow! What
&gt; year
&gt; is it?&quot;. A 1970 I told him. But according to the
&gt; sticker
&gt; inside the door, it rolled off the assembly line in
&gt; August
&gt; of 1969 - possibly during the Woodstock Music
&gt; Festival.
&gt; That's what I like to think anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; For the rest of the day, the mileage figure was
&gt; tickling the
&gt; back of my head, but I couldn't figure out why. It's
&gt; a number
&gt; I have heard before in connection with something
&gt; else. After
&gt; work today, as I was heading to the parking lot it
&gt; hit me. 230,000
&gt; miles is approximately the mean Earth-Moon distance!
&gt; 
&gt; As I settled in for my 25 mile commute home, I began
&gt; to imagine
&gt; driving to the Moon. The building where I work was
&gt; the Earth,
&gt; and home was the Moon. The entire 230,000 journey
&gt; would be
&gt; compressed into an ordinary 25 mile jaunt. As I hit
&gt; the interstate,
&gt; I imagined a special, invisible road heading upward.
&gt; I soon left
&gt; the other cars behind, heading out into space.

Hey... can you package some of that stuff up &amp; send it
to Texas via overnight... Been a long time..... &lt;LOL&gt;
