Subject: Re: [VB] type 4 cooler in a 1600 dog house

I bought  a fan shroud extended to fit a type 4 oil cooler in a 1600 dog
house but  have not had the engine out yet to replace it. Does anyone run
this set up  and how much difference did it make?



I put this on an engine about 5 years ago.  the oil temps dropped  about 10 
C. (about 18F)   This is a significant drop... same bus,  same gauges, same 
roads, same weather.  
 
 However, at the same time I swapped to SP heads (the DP ones  were bad), 
cleaned out the casting between the fins in the heads, and replaced  the rings 
and rod bearings.  I can't say how much of the cooling was  due to which.    The 
engine  pushes my 61 15 window around  these days.    I think it's a good  
system.
