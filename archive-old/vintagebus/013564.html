Subject: Clutch problems? WHAT A TRIP!
Message-ID: &lt;19991002202909.35554.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

hey all..just got back from the DBG event...Turtle Springs. Jim Ellis is a 
GREAT guy...
I had to leave early because of work...DOWN WITH KFC/TACO BELL!! Down with 
them!
anywho...
during the bus trek this morning I was holding everyone up because i had a 
shaky ride and my bus was accelerating horribly...they were yackin about me 
on the CBs...and I was following a split (the Garlic Box) and he was doing a 
lot better than me...
when I shift into 4th there is just absolutely no power...I mean uphill 
..ANY hill I would lose speed and have to go back down to 3rd...
I'm thinking its my clutch...
my clutch cable is rusted to H-E-double hockey sticks.
so I can't adjust it...i need to throw a new one in...
but just to make sure...I'm asking
my clutch has a lot of travel in the pedal...free travel..and when I get to 
where it takes a little effort to push...the clutch lets out by just barely 
pressing the pedal past the loose part...
do I just need to adjust this and all will be fine? or do I need to drop the 
engine in fear of a clutch plate that looks like a toasted marshmallow?

lemme know...
thanks!
