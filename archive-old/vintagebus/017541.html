Subject: Type 3 side marker lights for bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone.  I've seen these type 3 euro lights
wired up on some busses.

Can someone give me an approx. &quot;going&quot; price for
these? Are they hard to find? Does anyone have a set
they are willing to part with? Thanks for your time!

p.s. 
Ronnie once again delivered on the goods and sent me
out a new rancho 4.12 tranny with new mounts and
gaskets, ect.  A++ service all the way!
