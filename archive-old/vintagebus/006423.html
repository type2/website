clara:
i have a couple deluxe rear side glass panels
to replace pop-outs, they are larger and mount
with seals and no frames.
is this the option for less pop-outs you referred to ?

it's cold and drafty in new york, i just don't need so
many holes in the bus. i'm using the roof glass holes
but not the sunroof hole, i thought i would save that for a
westy conversion on a late bus, it's almost two feet
longer, over the rear bed area- unless someone else needs
it for a splittie ...

i would like to establish a connection with someone  who has
good access to scrap yard parts , makes regular trips, and
could ship me some parts...pretty much nothing in my area...
