Subject: urgent!! need double cab gas tank compartment divider...

Hi All,

Just got back from body shop and realized that the passenger side panel that
goes between the storage area behind the rear seat and the compartment for
the gas tank is fairly wasted along the edge....  (drivers side panel is
perfect.. go figure).  So, I'm out to find a replacement.  Or, I guess I'll
have to weld it up but it won't look perfect... (I'm sure you all would
inspect such locations at a show right ;-) )

Anyone have one or can at least tell me which years/models I should be able
to find one that matches?

My pickup is a 59.

Thanks much

Dave
