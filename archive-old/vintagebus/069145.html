Subject: Re: [VB] International Travel Questions

Hi!

This is Barb (of the Eric and Barb).  Back in about 1987 I went to Germany.  
We were not facing the terrorist and war threats of today, but I also asked 
what I should do or not do in that country.  The last thing I wanted to do 
was to offend anyone.  While I was there, I diligently put into practice what 
I had been told and I noticed that in the small quiet towns and countryside, 
I was treated far more politely and given more help than the person I was 
travelling with, or other tourists I noticed.

Basic simple rules (doesn't help the scary war stuff, but helps keep the 
visit on a friendly basis with the people) to think about.

1.  Don't wave the US flag and don't make a big deal about being from 
America.  
     Even when I went years ago, I was cautioned that many of the people have 
a
     very stereotypical view of the &quot;ugly American tourist&quot; and they are sick 
of them!
     I personally witnessed an example of a Texas lady being so obnoxious 
that 
     even I was ready to send her home!  Anyway, if you go into the small 
towns
     and countryside, you need not mention where you are from right away.  
Let
     someone get to know you a bit so they give you a chance to see that you 
are 
     nice people.

2.   When I was asking for directions or help, I started every time by 
saying, 
      &quot;excuse me, I'm sorry, but could you please help me?&quot;  While it sounds
       overly contrite in our society, the difference it made in Germany was
       enormous.  People who had not been willing to help other English 
people
       just a minute before, were far more patient and helpful to me.  I also 
learned
       those phrases and a few other key phrases in German so it showed that 
I
       was making an attempt at their language in their country.  I found 
that only
       a few of the people I ran into actually spoke more than a few words of 

       English! 

3.    I am sure the country has changed a great deal since I was there, but e
ven
       in the late 1980's, a woman who wore shorts was viewed by the locals 
as 
       little better than a street walker.  It was really hard for me to 
believe that, but
       since the girl who had lived there and was giving me tips was so 
adament, I
       very reluctantly left all shorts at home and packed light skirts and 
dresses.
       I was shocked that it was really true!  I was always treated kindly 
and with 
       respect when I would go up to someone for help.  I saw older folks 
       literally turn away from women in shorts and ignore them, or just be 
very
       curt to them!  Again, I was in small towns and countryside, so I don't 
know
       how people in the larger cities react, but it is something to keep in 
mind and
       maybe pack both just to be safe!

4.    As far as the really scary stuff, if you take care of the little, 
polite details and
       don't wave the flag or your nationality in their face, you should be 
treated very
       kindly and respectfully by the locals and they will go out of their 
way to help
       you.  That way, if you do need some extra help for any reason, you are 
far 
       more apt to get it.  Our culture has simply forgotten how important 
being
       polite and courteous is, the Germans have not.

5.     Just don't do anything to stand out from the locals.  As I say, they 
are well
        aware of the &quot;ugly obnoxious American tourist&quot;.  They are not 
impressed
         by money being flashed around.  They don't have the fake 
surface-friendly
         behavior that our culture has, so don't expect people on the street 
to be
         real smiley and say hi to you.  But they are very sincere and 
generous
         in their help if you stop someone on the street or ask a clerk for 
         assistance.  If you behave in politely and have your &quot;guest&quot; manners 
on,
         then no one will pay any extra attention to you.

Good luck and go and have the trip of your life!!
Barb&amp;Eric
