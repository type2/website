Subject: SPG Crank Info?  (fwd)

&lt;&lt;Dan:   I was looking at your web site.   I have a  69mm SPG ROLLER CRANK 
that needs to be indexed and trued.  I have tried RIMCO, BERG, FALICON, ED 
KORN, SCAT and so far have not been able to find anyone who can deal with 
this crank.
Do you know of anyone who is familiar with and can index and align this crank 
or have any leads as to who might be able to do it??
Do you have any data on the original SPG company?

Thanks.

Anyone know anything about this one?  I sure don't.
