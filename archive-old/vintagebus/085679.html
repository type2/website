Subject: shift rod bushings

So, the tranny's out in my 67 bus, and I figured I'd replace the shift
rod bushings.  It turns out that there were no bushings on the rear
shift rod (now I know why it rattled).  I got some new bushings (look
like badminton birdies), but I'm not sure exactly where they go.  Looked
in the shop manuals, but couldn't find any pictures to help.

So, where exactly do these bad boys go?  One at each end of the tunnel
that holds the shift rod?  In the middle of the tunnel?  Or does it
matter?

TIA,
Russell
