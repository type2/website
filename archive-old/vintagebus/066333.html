Subject: RE: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

That's a good point. I will need to ask MVD what the new rules are here in
AZ. Now in AZ when you sell a vehicle you are supposed to remove the plate
and turn it in or move it to the new vehicle. If you turn them in you get a
refund on the spot of unused registration fees. Got back 18 bucks when I
turned some plates in last month!!

&gt; after a weeks work, drove it from monterey,
&gt; california to chicago without any plates.  he later
&gt; told me that he was stopped once, in colorado i
&gt; think, for not having plates.  he had all the sales
&gt; documentation and didn't get a ticket.

In New Mexico, the plates stay with the owner, and
you've got 30 days to register the vehicle in your
name, so it's legal here to drive for a MONTH w/out
plates, as long as you are carrying the paperwork,
(bill of sale, title, insurance, etc.)

It's getting worse, but it's still more laid back than
California.
