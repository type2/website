&quot;but I need the
boxed floor section immediately behind the lower nose.&quot;
Not sure but i think you are talking about the inner structure going from
side to side and attaching to the frame in the middle and a-pillars on each
side , if so use Wolfs burg west's section , easier to install , and i fab
the filler plates for each side at the a-pillars, also the outter section
with the oval holes in it.
