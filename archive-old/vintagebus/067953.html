Subject: Re: [VB] Window replcement

All buses have hinges in the third window back on each
side for pop-outs. Pop-outs in all 6 windows was a
M-code option. Chances are that if your bus is a
factory Westy than you only have hinges in the rear
two windows, you can add pop-outs here and put
stationary glass in the remaining windows. I have seen
where people have welded, riveted, and even screwed
hinges into the bus, but I wouldnt have that done.

 Can louvered westy windows be changed back to pop
 outs. I really don't 
 like the look of louvered windows and would like to
 change them. If 
 anyone knows the answer or has tried this I would
 like to know.
 
 Thanks
