Subject: Re: [VB] Fuchs for sale

Heck, I've even seen 'usable' 7's and 9's for $800!

The #1 thing I caution people about with Fuchs wheels is tomake
sure they're getting *REAL* Fuchs and not cast replicas.  There
are more replicas running around in the VW community than real ones.
If the back have a 'grainy' appearance, they're fake.

The other thing that makes me giggle is when people advertise 15x6
as 'deep dish' wheels.  Until you've seen the 9&quot; and 11&quot; RSR Fuchs,
you haven't seen 'deep'!

&gt; &gt;For all those interested in the Fuchs that I am selling. I believe they are
&gt; 15&quot;, they are not chromed and missing center caps. I want $500 plus shipping
&gt; and handling. 
&gt; 
&gt; $500!  You must be kidding?  Since these are from a 68 or 69 they will be
&gt; the old style Fuchs and probably be 15&quot;x 5.5&quot; or 6&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless these wheels are perfect try more like $250-$300.

&gt; Everyone knows Wheel Enhancement is a huge rip-off, but absolutely perfect
&gt; wheels go for $800 a set.  Unless you get into weird sizes like 15&quot;/16&quot; by
&gt; 8&quot; or  9&quot; then try like $500-$600 for one wheel.
&gt; 
&gt; Be different and do cookie cutters or phone dials on your bus, they are
&gt; almost free and very unique.
