I found this Wednesday and spent considerable time on the phone with this
guy.  Real nice guy, from a die-hard VW family (wife gave me the &quot;VW quiz&quot;.)

He already has offers of $3200 ... and it didn't sound to be worth a
long-distance purchase.  I passed it over for several reasons:

  1) He said the cab floors were repaired with aluminum panels that were pop
riveted.
  2) Dash has been cut to add a oil pressure, oil temp, and volt meters.
  3) Rear seat is gone and replaced with the &quot;2/3&quot; of split fold seat,
turned sideways so that it faces the 3rd door.
  4) Rockers were cut by PO and sounds like repair wasn't really done
properly.

The engine is a 5-year old (50,000 mile) rebuild.  This thing sounds like
suitable daily driver, but a major project as far as getting it back to
stock (if that is your thing).

Seriously, it isn't that bad -- just wasn't fitting the profile of what I am
seeking.  Sounds more like it would be worth $1800 to me -- given the rust
repairs required.
