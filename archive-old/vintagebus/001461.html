Didn't get a whole lot done tonight but made progress.  Started off by
putting the fixed speedo out of the 66 into the 67.  Before installing it, I
needed to put in that chrome decoration ring but I'll be darned if the one
from the 66 was pitted and rusted and the one of the 67 has lost all its
tabs.  I really need another one of these - does anyone have one with all
the tabs in good shape they want to get rid of?  I'm gonna really need this
both of mine are shot.

I then went through and fixed the turn signal switch.  1 wire had a busted
solder joint and the other was about ready to go so I soldered them both up.
I decided it was time to check my work so I hooked up the battery and
proceeded to check things out.  I have hi beam/lo beam, amber park lights
(absolutely breath taking), the parklights go off when I switch the
headlights on - is this right?), backlighting on speedo and royale fuel
guage.  Problems:  No tail lights to speak of and one brake light.  That's
fine though - I'm gonna take the tail lights out of the 66, move them over,
and clean up the grounds.  When I turn on the hazard lights, the switch
comes on (internal light) but none of the 4 lights flash.  When I put on the
turn signal, I hear the flasher but once again, no flashing lights.  I'm
gonna replace the flasher box on this 67 with the KYMCO conversion part that
I put in the 66 last year and see
if that fixes the problem.  Radio doesn't get anything but static and since
the dash is 1967 specific, the 66 bus's sapphire won't fit.  I think I'll
just pull that 66 radio and stick in the 67 someplace because I like the
sound of that old 6v radio and crackly speaker. :-)
Turn signal makes flashing noises but no lights come on.  Sounds to me like
bad grounds or something screwy with that relay.

NQ

That was about all I got done tonight.  More later...
