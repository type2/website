Subject: Front Seat Covers Needed
Message-ID: &lt;7m8rm2$cl9p_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi Everyone,

My wife and I are getting tired of sitting on springs and horse hair on
the front seat (1/3-2/3 bench)of our '66 E-Z Camper.  I've sent away
for and recieved catalogs from TMI and J-Bugs (I haven't recieved my
Sewfine catalog yet) and have been pouring over them.  I'm planning to
get &quot;hog-ring&quot; type covers and do the install myself.  The type of
covers I want will have tweed fabric on the entire facings and only
have smooth vinyl on the sides and backings.

Here's what I need your help with: In your opinions, who really does
make the best quality seat covers for everyday use and how is their
customer service??  Is it worth the money to buy the &quot;pre-formed&quot;
cushions or are they just pre-cut flat foam that is easily made at
home??  Thanks again the advice.
