The DC's safari's still suck! Last year I painted hot paraffin into the cracks and stopped most of the leaks, but it's a mess to clean up. I have a ball of waxed cord that's used to seal house windows and pulls off in the summer without taking the paint or leaving putty, etc. Problem is it's too small in diameter to seal the frames to the body. Hmmm, cord comes in different dia. and parrafin is cheap. Any chemists or alchemists out there? What can I put in with the paraffin to keep it flexible so it won't crack? Glycerine? Flubber?  This commercial cord stays flexible well below freezing.  We'll let you know what happens. 

I made a donut run yesterday for the office, taking along a co-worker in the '63 DC. A guy who looked like he slept all night in the laundromat next door waves at me as we're getting back in the truck. I expect a thumbs up or OK signal for the bright, shiny RAL2000 paint and all the chrome. He staggers out, comes to my window and says, &quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot; I expect the usual, &quot;did you make it into a truck?&quot;, or &quot;what year is that thing?&quot;. Nope. He asks, &quot;How did you get such a pretty girl to ride in such an ugly truck?&quot;
