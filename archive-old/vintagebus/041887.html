&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Actually it is better to go by load range instead!  There are some LT radial 
&gt; tires that have lower load ranges than some P radial tires.  You really want 

Load range can mess you up too.  for example, a load range C 195/75R14 has
less load capacity than a passenger-rated 185R14!  The only number to look
at is the load rating in pounds.  My '71 station wagon needs at least 1540
pounds of load rating, for example.
