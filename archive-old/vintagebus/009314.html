Great feeling isn' t it Rex?  I just got back from a 20 mile drive in my
splitty - the first highway drive in over 6 weeks due to snow and salt.
Man, I had forgotten just how cool it is.  I'm gonna do the whole oil
change, valve adjustment, tranny fluid thing today getting prepped for this
years travels and such.  I really do need to get those 14&quot; rims and tires on
though.  I'm gonna dig through the old rim pile and see what I can find.

Congrats on getting your bus up and running.  Now when are you gonna give us
a stand by your van photo?  :-)

Erin
