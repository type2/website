You're on the right track with the clutch and accelerator cables, Ben.  Get
a set of heater cables next time you're at the store.  Zip tie the cables to
the springs on the passenger seat back.  Handy, but out of site.

Subject: [VB] Must haves for road trip


I would consider myself a novice (but passionate) owner of a '67 bus, and am
taking it from Kentucky to California in a little over a month, and just
wanted to get some opinions on must haves for the trip as far as tool and
spare parts go, as I am going to be placing an order to BusBoys soon. I have
the idiots manual, and already have a clutch cable, accelerator cable, and
v-belt on my list.
Any help would be greatly appreciated
Thanks
Ben Eilerman
