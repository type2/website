They buy Buses all the time, the cheap ones with low rust.  I don't personally
know of any within the past 6 months, perhaps a victim of the exchange rate

 What is going to England?  We just brought the three nicest buses that
were
 in 
 England to the US. A 54 RHD deluxe, a 53 swedish cargo door panel, and
a
 54 
 RHD DD panel.  It seems that as of recently, we have been winning this

 import/export battle thanks to the value of the dollar.

 &gt;I wonder if he feels the same way about all the cars and parts going to
 &gt;England?
