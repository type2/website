Hi Thom,
Hmm... nasty!   On this topic of galvanic reactions.  We have been wondering 
if the steel copper plated washers for the sump plate have the plating for 
some sort of corrosion protection, or reduction at least.  Or are they that 
way to reduce the differant metals of the sump, case, and the formation 
ofacid in the used oil?
  On another note, in days long past when the 36 HP engine was it for VW.  
There were kits that inserted a magnesuim rod into the sump area of the case 
by way of replacing the sump plug that was off to one side of the sump plate. 
 This pure magnesuim rod would react, and supposedly nuetralize oil acid 
formation before it could attack the case, or bearings surfaces.
Just another set of things to keep in mind!   Eric&amp;Barb
