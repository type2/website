Subject: Drivers front turn signal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok everyone,
I have a '59 panel and all of the wiring harness is brand new... 
My prob is that the front bullet turn signal doesn't work and the bulb isn't 
burnt out. I can hear the flasher clicking for the rear and the speedo light 
doesn't come on when i put the switch to the left because of this problem...  
Where should I start? Bad ground? bulb holder? everything past the flasher?

Probably really simple...I'm a wiring novice:)

Thanks alot--
Pete
