Subject: sandblasting logistics question (kinda long).

The engine and trans will soon be out of the e-vil bay bus I made as my
first ACCVW purchase. The engine is costed with oil, and in no way resembles
the rebuilt 1641 I was promised. The recent thread on unknown vs new engines
as well as the benifits of a spare to learn on has me inclinded towards a
new engine. My trans (type III, no rgbs :( ) has a kaput input shaft
bearing, and since type I/III trans are pretty cheap,
a rebuilt one of those is to precede it.
I would like to slean off the original paint primer, and slight patched of
surface rust on the underbody and engine
before replacing these assemblies. Assuming a 40 gal pressure sandblaster,
suffcient air and materials, what is the time frame in hours that can
be anticipated for sandblasting at least the entire engine bay and the cargo
area rear ward? I would like tot do the front at a seperate venture, since
my front floors need attetnion, and I would rather hav ethe beam out before
throwing sand around there (cargo rearward=no holes)
Choosing to avoid blasting at this time, is it wise to apply anythign then?
Any notion of undercoating or paints tend to make me believe
I am just hiding the surface corrosion, and is best removed entirely, or
entirely later.
My ultimate goal, is to have the bus running by fall, and am basically
trying to determine wheather I should blast it or not no,
or let it go a couple years, after she is running well and I've gone after
the body, since I plan to keep her out of the northern salt blaster and
rain, fo rthat matter (since all the glass leaks like sieves any way.
Thanks for any opinions and info.
