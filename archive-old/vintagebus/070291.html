Subject: Good VW flick to watch!!

Hi Volks,
Pen a post-it for on your monitor or have someone write it directly on your 
forhead!  Tommorrow at 8PM on AMC channel is a movie called &quot;Castle Keep&quot;.  
Definitely one to tape so you can rewind it and make sure you got to see all 
the VW fun.  It is a movie set in WWII and has an epic funny VW story laced 
into it.
Enjoy!
Eric&amp;Barb
