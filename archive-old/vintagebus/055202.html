Subject: Re: [VB] Dead Horse revived, wheres that hole??

Throttle plate is the lower butterfly valve, controlled by your
accelerator pedal, isn't it? I've seen some volks running a 009 with
34PICT drill a little hole in this plate, tap in a small machine
screw. Maybe it is supposed to weight the throttle plate and encourage
it to open. I'm not so familiar, I use the earlier design carb. Just
maybe you don't have the hole of which they speak. Also, I am pretty
sure the 009 was designed with a heavy foot / wide open throttle in
mind. Think of that.

Thanks for all the advice I received about timing and other issues
with my .009 and 34pict3 set up. I advanced my timing to about 10 BTDC
at idle and i see a definite inmprovement. However this procedure
brought up one BIG question.  What\Where is this hole in the throttle
plate on the carb that I am supposed to plug up.  I have looked my
carb up and down, and the only pluggable holes I find are the little
&quot;pipes&quot; where the vacuum hoses would go on a vac set up (already
plugge with a peice of hose with a screw in the end). So would someone
very SPECIFICALLY describe where this hole in the throttle plate is
located??
