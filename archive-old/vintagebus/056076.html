Subject: My new 62 15 window deluxe

hello all,
 Well after washing the new bus i think I can see hope shining through all
that surface rust. It needs rockers and lower doglegs but the out riggers
and jacking points are good, they even held the weight of the bus. It has
teh rear seat but is missing the middle seat, and it still has some of the
original panels in good shape. and it has all of its belt line trim and is
missing only one rear bumper trim. So far i need to replace both front
doors, the side doors, the rear hatch and the deck lid. Not to bad huh??

It was originally red on the bottom and white on top, what colors would that
have been?
there would have been a 40 horse motor in there correct?

Does anyone else on the list have one of these?

Thanks,
 Bryan
