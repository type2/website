The early bumpers are a pc of cake to straighten, why bother to re-press the
old one?

Any old timer at a bodyshop could have one very straight in 1-2 hours, no
bondo if you have the right guy.  Hammer them out, shrink 'em a bit if need,
hammer and dolly them, weld in a few new pcs , not ever a big deal IF YOU
HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH SIDES OF THE SURFACE.  Much easier to work than thin
sheetmetal.

Check out a metal finishing or shrinking video.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
don't forget to go to church
