Subject: Re: [VB] Terrible sound, help!

Hello AL

    Make sure your back brake drums are tight. If the Axle nut is in anyway
loose you will get this clicking sound. I have had this sound before and it
almost sounds like when you grind your teeth together but higher pitched it
will ruin your drums. I have already killed on drum because I didn't catch
in time. It had loosed up after about 2000 miles after I had put in a new
trans in and rebuilt the reduction boxes. :-(

&gt; Well, I have the motor running, and this is not in any way related to the
&gt; motor, I am sure.
&gt; Car rolling 15 mph (doesn't matter happens at any speed, to almost
stopped.
&gt; Clutch not depressed, engine off, trans in neutral (this was to diagnose.,
&gt; the sound is also in gear, with engine running at any speed)
&gt;
&gt; Sound: teriible clicking kind of sound, rythmic and loud, drowns out
motor,
&gt; worse when turning.
&gt; Could find no loose body components or things amiss with brakes, sound is
&gt; powerful enough to make whole bus seem as if it's amplifying it.
&gt;
&gt; Assumption: Bad differential? Of course in the brand new rebuild I
got.....
&gt; Let me know if you have any other ideas, it was fun to drive her after 9
&gt; months, but I am wiped and don't want to pull the trans like I know I am
&gt; headed for.
&gt; TIA,
&gt; AL
