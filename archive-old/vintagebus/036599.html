 Hehe...and don't forget that Volkswagen OWNS Rolls Royce!
 
 Ben, if I were you, I would have talked to that guy's manager too. 
 Whatta jerk he was. We have a pretty good relationship with the 
 dealers in our area, but they really don't understand the whole 
 vintage thing either. Every year we have the Bob Baker Vintage VW 
 Spring Festival and the dealer (Bob Baker) clears out their lot and 
 showroom to let us fill it up. It was pretty cool walking into the 
 showroom this year and almost tripping over a 1950 Hebmuller!
 
 Three years ago I had the 55 Westy in the showroom and one of the 
 sales drones asked me &quot;What is THAT?&quot; jeez...I said &quot;it's kinda like 
 a Eurovan, only a lot cooler...and a LOT cheaper.&quot;
  &gt;&gt;
I went to the dealership yesterday to get some new rear torsion bushings for 
my 61.

for some reason it's seems simpler to get this obscure item through VW.

They were very helpful.  I did have to pay for it now and wait till it comes 
in, cause they don't carry them in their own storeroom. Whatever.

THen my bug (drove the bug) didn't want to start.  No obvious reason, seemed 
like a fuel delivery problem.  Ended up getting it going, now it did not run 
at idle.  I drove straight home, ignoring all the other stuff I needed to do. 
 Worked when over 2500 rpms, but at a red light had to keep pumped the gas 
pedal.  People looked at me wierd.  How embarrassing.

Today I swapped carbs, runs like a champ.  Also tweeked with the carb on my 
65 westy, cause it started idling high after I sorted outthe fuel pump.  :) 
happy bus.

Also did some other stuff, next post.
