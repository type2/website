No, there is no seal between the RGBox and the spring plate.  However, with the bih nut trannys they have a welsh plug, that fits into the box.   If this leaks you get oil dripping.  :(:(:(

So you would need to undo the 4 bolts holding the RGBox to the spring plate, and pull the RGBox back so you can see the plug.  Oh first pull the wheel off and drain the oil out of the box.  Ok, look at the inner side of the box, there is a round plug about 2 or 3 inches in diameter.   clean up around it with a razor blade, in the groove  at the edge of the circle.   clean up the plug with 80 grit sandpaper till it is nice and shiny.   weld a m10 bolt to it and pull th eplug out.  You can use a couple pieces of wood to space it out and a bar with a hole drilled in it and tighten a nut on the bolt, or a nice puller with legs it you have one (puller that is, I assume you have legs)   I have pictures (pmail if you want them) of doing this I can hopefully post soon, as I just replaced the tranny &amp; rebuildt RGBoxes in Stephen Gutknechts 67 westy, and one of the plugs leaked after putting the oil in, so the plug was re pulled, and cleaned up and widen a tad carefully by tapping with !
a big ass 3/4 inch driver ratchet (this was an item just the right shape and diameter as the inner diameter of the plug) in the plug and tapping on the edge to spread it maybe a fraction of a millimeter.  but you will have to examine your plug to see whatthe deal is. 

 New plugs are available, plastic is cheaper, but not so good I think the metal ones are $25 each, which I think is a bit high, so reuse them if I can.  I used the avaition sealant for reinstallation, then painted over it withblack rattlecan.  No longer leaks.  Yes, this is a PITA, but with the right tools really doesn't take all that long.

If you have a Bentley reprint of the 63 VW Transporter workshop manul there is also and explanation of removing/installing these plugs.


Just pulling the RGBox back, and cleaning it up and using sealant *may* work, but I would consider that a temporary fix.


When replacing the RGBox bolts, be careful not to strip them out.  Start them by hand, usually it will take some wiggling.  Start all before tightening any down.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I searched the archives on this, and couldn't find the answer. Is there a
&gt; seal that goes between the reduction boxes and the spring plates? After
&gt; replacing my tranny some time ago, I've got a leak there on the left side.
&gt; The right side holds fluid just fine. If there is no seal, should I use some
&gt; kind of sealant? It looks like I can jack up the left side, unbolt the redux
&gt; box from the spring plate (maybe remove the wheel first), pry the spring
&gt; plate back a bit, and squeeze some sealant in there. Would this be possible?
