  Subject: [VB] spare cooling flaps/linkage?


  Does anyone out there know of  a source for control flaps and their
  linkage?
  I need a set for a '71 doghouse model fan housing.
  I've checked the usual suspects, but there aren't any re-pro's
  available, unless any of you know otherwise. I'd really appreciate any
  help.

  Thanks,
  Rocco
