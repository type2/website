&gt;There is an additional problem with the adapter.  Due to manufacturing
&gt;tolerances, it will fit one brand of MC and not another.

I used the adapter from Wolfgang and ran into this with a German MC.
The adapter is basically a very thick aluminum washer - a big hole
in the center and two small holes in the sides for the MC bolts.
The big hole is not the same diameter all the way through - it necks
down a few mm at one end.

With a Brazilian MC, you can put the rubber boot on the end of the MC
and then put the spacer over the whole thing - the flange on the MC
seats down on the spacer and the narrower part of the spacer helps
keep the boot on the MC.  (I verified this at the FLVWPS with the
spacer and a Brazilian MC.)

With a German MC, the nose of the MC hits the narrower part of the
spacer before the flange seats on the spacer, even without the boot
installed.  I had to use a Dremel to chamfer the inside end of the
narrow piece to get clearance for the MC.  I didn't take off enough
to get the boot in there too; my boot is just held on around the
push rod.

I paid $40 for the spacer kit in fall 2000 from Wolfgang.  It came
with the spacer, two longer bolts, the rubber boot, and two seals
for the reservoir-to-MC connection.  The spacer looked to me like
it was machined out of a chunk of thick aluminum rod.  If you had
the tools it'd be simple to make - cut off a piece of rod, drill
the smaller center hole all the way through, drill the bigger center
hole almost all the way through, drill the bolt holes, smooth the
flat surfaces, deburr, done.  Someone in the local VW club, who
has access to machine tools, measured my spacer before I put it
on the Bus; I think he intended to make one of his own.
