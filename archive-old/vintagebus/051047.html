Subject: Re: [VB] bearing noise

Hi Diana,
If you get chunks out of a RGB it is best to park it until you fix it.  Those 
can get real bad real fast.  Otherwise your bearing rumble could be due to 
too big of diameter bore in the front drums for the outer race of the 
bearing/s.  Seen this happen due to badly machined new Brazilian drums.
