&gt; fellow listee has offered to hook me up w/ a good used flywheel.  My boss 
&gt; (who's an Alpha nut) acts as if its a big balance issue to do this and I 
&gt; should opt to just replace the ring gear on my existing flywheel.  Any 
&gt; ideas/advice/concerns I should know about?  Not worried about being perfect 
&gt; just want dependability.

Unless the flywheel was balanced as a unit with the other components
(crank, pulley, clutch plate...) and stayed in that relation would it be
an issue. Not to mention that once the flywheel had work done on it
rebalancing would probably be needed anyway. So I respectfully disagree.
