  Here is another thing to think about on a RB trans.If you load it up and 
snap a drive axle you will not lose the wheel due to the axle not being 
attached to anything.It would take a lot to snap a stub axle.Kind of like the 
vehicles with a floating rear axle with the bearings at the outermost hub it 
will just not move anymore and and not lose the wheel and the big ass over 
loaded trailer that is being carried.       Ted Smith      Detroit     59

Hi Ted,
Good point!  Plus VW did go to the short stub axle in all thier VWs once they 
went to the CV system, and the bus just got heavier, and heavier as the 1970s 
went past.  Eric&amp;Barb
