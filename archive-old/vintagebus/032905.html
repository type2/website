Hi Jason,
Clara is putting one of those together to try out with her 3.875 R&amp;P freeway 
flier.  There are two things about these we do not like about them.  
1.  If you have a piston or cylinder problem on a long trip you might have to 
wait quite a while for a replacement.  Where with 1641 slip in cylinders you 
could just install a set of 1600 P&amp;Cs.  We have over 50,000 miles on our 1641 
slip in P&amp;Cs SP engine and probably because we keep the RPMs down and oil 
temp down below 220F at most we have had no problems so far.
2.  The forward area of # 3 cylinder bore in the case is thin with stock 
bore.  With boring out of this area it gets way too thin and often cracks the 
case there spraying oil all over the FW and clutch.  Making sure the Machine 
shop radiuses the bottom corner of this bore helps, but is not a guarentee of 
no cracking there.
