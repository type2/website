Check to make sure your gas cap is venting properly.

&gt;O.K. list, here's the situation.  I have a generator fuel pump that seems to
&gt;be sealed, no way to open it.  I have suddenly developed fuel delivery
&gt;problems.  No fuel for a while and then fuel again later.  I have an in-line
&gt;filter so I can see what is going on.  Is there any way to open this pump up
&gt;and clean it out?  I'm sure that there is some type of blockage that comes
&gt;and goes in there.
