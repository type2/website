Subject: 30-PICT-1 versus 30-PICT-3

In my 67 DC I have a stock 1500 engine with 30-PICT-1 carb and 009
distributor.  (The 009 was the first owner's idea around 25 years
ago--I'll fix that someday.)  I just removed the carb for rebuilding and
will be sending it to Rimco to have the throttle shaft rebushed.  I have
available a clean 30-PICT-3 which I thought I might use in the interim.

Will I create any problems by using the 30-PICT-3 with the 1500 &amp; 009
combination, even temporarily?  Performance problems, run too lean, run
too rich, bad MPG, overheating, whatever.
