Volks,

I've gone all VW!  I've given up my corporate career path and have decided
to go it alone.  Have no money, spent all I had on the '67 Westy... but I've
decided it is time for a change.

Ronnie and I are working on a computer project for the next 3 months.... so
the list is again a big influence on my life :)

Steven Howell has also graciously agreed to be my Internet Service Provider,
as I have to give up my current residence to cut expenses.  The '67 Westy
will be my home for the next 4 months :)  Steven has agreed to host my &quot;home
on the Internet&quot; that will play a key part in my new vocation.

Anyway -- next week I will be driving down to Lake Havasu to meet Ronnie in
person and stay a few days... plan on going I5 via Sacramento... anyway, I
will surely be needing more favors, so if anyone needs things transported...
let me know.  I'm taking my fully camper west, so not a whole lot of space,
but the passenger seat is free and I will make storage space if you need
something transported.  Steven Howell is on the Seattle / Shoreline border,
so over the next few weeks I will be around Seattle too :)

I'm sure over the next 3 months I will be making the Lake Havasu to Seattle
run at least 3 times... this first visit will be just for a few days, so
quick turn around if you need something delivered :)

Thanks to all.

  Stephen Gutknecht
  Renton, Washington
