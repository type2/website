&gt;I'd like to see more people posting pictures
&gt;of themselves with their buses on their websites. 
&gt;the folks that haul around stuff on long trips to help others out, or
&gt;make long cross country trips just to see the world.
&gt;Let's see some pictures of you!

Well, I am one of those people who use (some say abuse) my buses.  On 
my 5000 mile trip in my 54 Kombi I took a spare engine, spare tranny, 
and enough tools to fix anything that might happen on the road.

My stash of parts saved 3 asses (including mine) on the trip.

The 1st save was Tuscon Terry who lost a rear wheel off his lowered '64 
21-window in the desert of California due to a stripped axle nut (his 
wheel bounced down the median without even losing the hubcap!).  I had a 
36mm axle nut on my spare tranny which I gave him and Richard Kimbrough 
had him back on the road in about 1.5-2 hrs.  Those lowered buses look 
cool until you lose a wheel doing 55mph...

The 2nd save was Michael Cathey of Albuquerque who was bringing his '57 
sunroof Standard to the show to sell and blew his engine in Needles, CA.  
He told me what happened at the OCTO show and I told him to use the spare 
36hp engine I had brought to go get it.  He got the bus to the Classic and 
was able to sell it there (I followed him to deliver it in Long Beach so I 
could get my engine back!).

The 3rd save was when my tranny in the '54 locked up in Little Rock, 
Arkansas.  Between the tranny that locked up and the spare tranny I had 
enough parts to get the spare so that I could get home.

Get to know your bus &amp; drive it!

A pic of me loaded up &amp; headed back from CA is at
