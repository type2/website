&gt;My favorite one on the 61 single cab is &quot;nice bus, but what happened to the
&gt;rest of it&quot;

Heh-heh, yeah, I've had people actually argue with me on Single Cabs, that
&quot;it must be some sort of conversion,&quot; they think I'm lying that it's a real
VW truck...


When I got my latest Single Cab ('54), my neighbor came over.  He thought it
was some sort of chop-job at first until I convinced him it was factory.  I
had previously extolled the virtues of my '55 Kombi, yeah, yeah, it's pretty
rare, pretty hard to find.  I think when I told him the Single Cab was even
older, he didn't believe they were rare anymore...

Later,
