You can always change the oil in the stock air cleaner to one more suited
for extreme cold temps.  But if you do go for one of the paper element air
cleaners, do not get the ones that sit only about 2 or 3 inches up off of
your carb.  You want to get one that reaches up above the carb by 4 or 5
inches if possible.  
The reason is two fold.  
One, the air flow at the top of the carb body/throat is in a swirling
motion like that of an undertow current at the saltwater beaches.  An air
cleaner with the short base disrupts it...secondly, this disruption will
allow the gas that squirts into the throat (from accelerator pump) to move
farther up towards the air cleaner than is normal.  And it is normal for
this to happen.  It gets sprayed around and not all of it is going
directly down the carb throat right from the get go.
I'm sure you could get by with the shorter ones, I see them in use often.
