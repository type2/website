&gt;Do not know the bus in question that you guys are talking about, but walk
through panels have no upper rear vents.     &lt;

Hey all,
        I concur with both Eric and Dave Easterwood.  I have responded with
the potential owner hoping to get m-code info as I also have a bench panel
w/o upper vents.  As always....I have never seen anything VW that was a
hard fast standard.  I am curious, though, if a particular US Vw camper
converter was partial to this type of panel.
