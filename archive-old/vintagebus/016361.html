hey,
thanks for the concern over my lungs, but that is not me spraying. you 
should have seen the cloud my buddy was surrounded in while he was spraying. 
my friend and i were about 100 feet away with our beers watching... yelling 
at him to put a respirator on. IT WAS RIGHT BEHIND HIM!! upon finishing he 
got some butt wipe to blow his nose and showed us all the green gunk that 
came out. sick! i wear a respiratot even when i rattle can outside in the 
driveway.
later,
