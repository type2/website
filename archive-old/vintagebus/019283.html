Does anyone know about this bubble top version and if
there are pics online somewhere of others such as this
one?
------------
Two thoughts...
1.&gt; There was a killer powder blue, or really chalky
dove blue, splitty camper at the Rocky Mtn Motor Works
show two Summers ago that had an asymetrical white
fiberglass top. Taller side toward the LHD drivers
side. I personally thought this bus was the bomb. Very
nice, young, unpretentious family. Just lucky to have
then recently scored it. I would love to have owned
this rig. It had a really nicely preserved OG cheapie
wood interior in it similar to the Sundial.

2.&gt; I have a set old Foreign Car Digest magazines.
1960-1965. In one issue there is an article presenting
how to &quot;hop-up&quot; a cheap ($150.00) junkyard panel bus.
This article was one of the inspirations for a few
cartoons that I drew back in 1996. This poor panel bus
was butchered to include a HUGE post WWII plexiglass
dome grafted into the roof and, I think two smaller
bubble windows, one into each side. The photo showed a
two-toned metallic blue and metallic maroon color
combo. &lt;Oooooo, I'm getting a chubby!!!&gt; ;-)
I will attempt to locate and scan a photo of this
beast and post it to somewhere like Thom's site or the
VWPlanet Gallery.
