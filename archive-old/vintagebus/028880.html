Subject: bearing ID &amp; OD

Hello all,
does anyone have the dimensions for the outer and/or inner lower
bearing(s) on the small nut redux boxes?
the lower outer bearing is part # 311 501 283.  There is a bearing shop
here in town and I'd like to see if I can get the bearing locally before
ordering one...  I'm trying to get this thing back on the road ASAP.  I
was talking to a VW shop here...and the guy thinks that the outer is a
standard bearing that I should be able to get from a bearing
shop....does anyone have these bearings laying around they could get the
numbers off of?

Thanks a lot for your help guys/gals.  I appreciate it.
