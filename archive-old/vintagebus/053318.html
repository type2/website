Subject: Windshield replacements

Hello, list.

I am in need of a replacement driver's side windshield for my SC.  Here in my 
area of Florida, they don't grow on trees and searching on the internet has 
been fruitless thus far.  So, instead of dealing with someone's fogged and/or 
pitted cast-offs plus the cost of shipping, I am considering having a local 
auto glass shop cut a new one using the passenger side as a pattern.  They say 
they can do it for about $60.

Has anyone done this with any luck?  Or should I just hold out for the real 
deal?

TIA

Michael
