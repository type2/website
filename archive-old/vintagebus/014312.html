&gt; Regarding my last message..
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, I confused myself; I was mixing up my
&gt; research into
&gt; *reproing* and *repairing* bumpers.
&gt; 
&gt; I was quoted ~$800 to make a die to straighten the
&gt; flat section of
&gt; a ribbed bumper - a die 6&quot; wide or so which could be
&gt; used on a small
&gt; press - 20 tons would be MORE  than enough!  As thin
&gt; as these things
&gt; are, vice-grips would probably be enough.
&gt; 
&gt; This is for Ribbed Bumpers; late-model bumpers are
&gt; heavier, so
&gt; would take a bit more juice.

Instead of tryin to repair 6 inches at a time, we
could build the dies to only press out 2 inches at a
time... less surface area, more pressing power...
biggest press I have is a 20 tonner....
