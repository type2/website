Under all that black gunk it almost seems that you have a flycut 40hp
head the way the studs look. There was a fix for the bad studs on the
40hp head and I have done a couple, but the rest went to the shop.
Besides that head, you have a more serious problem, like flushing your
crankcase and a good dip for everything else.

	I thought I could tighten some nuts, clean a few parts and have
a nice 'putt-around-town' motor.  Boy, was I wrong.
	So.  My dilemma.  I have a sngle port head that has a rocker arm
stud that stripped.
	The thing is it's a weird configuration for the stud.  looks
like it was rebuilt and 'reworked' with some special type hardware.
	Has anyone seen anything like this before.  Does any one know
where I can get a replacement.  Does anyone have a stack of junked heads
that they are willing to take a look at to see if I they happen to have
one.

here are pix http://home.mindspring_dot_com/~otherbox/misc/IMG_0845.JPG

as a side note, the 'stud' looks to be a single machined piece.

	Thanks in advance for all your help.
