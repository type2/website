A guy I know found 2 NOS VW roof racks.  He hasn't bought them yet because
he wants to be sure for what model they are.

He saw a # number, but isn't sure about it anymore (he didn't write it down.

He thinks the # must be something like  #000071115.

Anyone know for which type2 it can be.

(These are full lenght roof racks !)
