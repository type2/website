Subject: like there is a water shortage for radiators!

&gt;Therefore, I bought a 92 VW Fox this morning. It is &gt;a red two door and seems to be the perfect $200 car -&gt;Anybody have a VW Fox before?

Joe,

When I worked at a rental car place in 94/95 we had brand new foxes. I will admit they were despised by the clientel in general, but I thought they were cool, and this is before my own VW days!

I liked them because they were the only stickshifts in our fleet.
