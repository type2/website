Hello Dave   I have used a bunch of these carbs. They work OK.  I noticed 
that the spray nozzle isn't  lined up right to make the spray go down the throat 
correctly.  This makes sense cause you need to put gas in it to adjust the 
nozzle which they couldn't have done.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
