I love these threads.  Both sides go back and fourth
and try to convince each other 'their'  right.  Like
they realy will get the other side to say...ahhhh! I
finally realize you are right.  That is what I love
about this list! he he he!

Here is my view for the hell of it.

VW put these flaps on all the GERMAN built air
cooleds.  No offense but I would take their opinion
WAYYYY over all the backwoods hick mechanics on this
list (myself included thank you :-)  What the heck put
the damn things on to be safe is what I say!  Does it
hurt anything to have them on? HECK no!  Does it hurt
to leave them off ??? hmmmmm dont know for sure.  If i
was a bettin man, I would err on the safe side.  After
all what do these things cost at swap meets?  With the
large numbers folks out there not using them I bet you
could find all the stuff for free? I gobble the stuff
up by the truck full at swaps.  Then re sell the stuff
at a large profit to folks at our shop when their cars
run like shit in mildy cold weather.

Anyways I could not give a rats ass what anyone else
out there does, use them or not.  I just listen to VW
and follow their lead on this matter it costs nothing
to do and cannot hurt...

Oh yea I LOVE the  &quot;...mexican VWs come from the
factory without flaps&quot;  HA HA !! Oh yea...how many
folks out there would trust mexican built vws!  HA
HA!!  Crap at least half of the stuff the shop gets
from mexico is junk....the other half we hope lasts a
year.  Sorry I will stick with the way the Germans did
it.

beep!
poo-p
