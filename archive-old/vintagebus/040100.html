Hi list,

     I was traveling rt 22 east, and over Penn View Mountain, west of Bill 
Matthews auto sales, (where the trucks that haul our milk are stored) is a 
(primered?) splitty bus being restored!  I have half a mind to(I have a 
whole mind, but half says to): go see if its for sale!  Does anyone on the 
list own it?  just figured I'd ask,

Matt in Pa (located about 10 miles west from the above mentioned bus)
