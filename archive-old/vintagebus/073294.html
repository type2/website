Subject: RE: [VB] Empi Wheel

The wheel isn't mine but I recently acquired one just like it. I do have the crack at 12 o'clock, no horn button, all original mounting hardware wires ect, and surface rust on the chrome (easily removed via steel wool) and wear on the faux wood.  
 
I guess I need to take some Pics!

Hi Sean,

Somewhere between 100 and 500.... several things affect the cost:

- has it been restored? If so, take dollars away
- is the horn button original?
- if it hasn't been restored, is there a crack at 12 oclock. (these vdm
wheels are notorious to crack there...)
- is the wheel complete (i.e. all horn parts, wires, original screws,
etc)


so, with that in mind, if the wheel is in original condition, I'd say
300-500. 




... I could be interested in that wheel if it's yours, pmail me.

Sean asked:
Anybody know what these wheels are selling for these days?
