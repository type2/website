009s are produced cheaply.  they read diferent amounts of total advance
&gt;from one to another. the &quot;best&quot; way to time a 009 is to set it for its
max advance, somewhere between 28 and 32 degree BEFORE top dead center.
i prefer 28 because it runs cooler.

for the single vacuum advance, you should static time it to 7.5
degrees.  or, you can disconnect the vacuum line, and time it with the
timing light to 7.5 degrees BEFORE top dead center. (easier in my
opinion)

for the dual vacuum advance, these can only set the timing with these
with a timing light while it is running at an idle.  set them at an idle
to 5 degrees AFTER top dead center.
