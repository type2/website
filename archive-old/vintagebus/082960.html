Subject: Re: [VB] Re: prepping sump plates gaskets and a punt

Have you tried Curil T for the sump yet? For sealing machined surfaces, I
haven't been able to find anything better for sealing.

I use Curil T on everything (long block) except:

Grey RTV for cylinder bases
Copper RTV for under the four head-stud washers in the valve cover area.
Massaging grey RTV into the oil pump gaskets by pinching it between your
fingers and rubbing it in.
I Copper RTV the valve cover gasket to the valve cover (dry between the
gasket and head) and never change them for years without isssue.
Grey RTV under the two case halve nuts near the camshaft (I don't bother
with the paper gasket)

There's a lot of ways to seal a motor so my way is certainly not the only
way, but i've been doing mine like this for a few years now and not a drop
of oil leaking from any of my builds anymore. No sweaty leaks or anything.
Nice Thing about the Curil T is it cleans off with papertowels and brake
cleaner too. No scraping or anything. I used to use the Permatex Aviation
stuff, but cleaning it off between teardowns was rediculous. I still have
some on my current drag motor case that i've given up on. lol  :-)

&gt; The pisser for me is that my 1.5qt sump gasket is weaping a hair.... Grrr!
&gt; Annoying problem, I coated it very well with Permatex aviation gasket
sealer
&gt; as well to no avail.
