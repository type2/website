Subject: Title Quest Update - Cab Floor

Doug, Split List,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has anybody removed this [cab] floor intact or is it better
to take it out in sections? ... The front beam is out of the
bus so access top and bottom isn't a problem. Where to cut on the rear
and sides of the floor is pretty obvious. What about along the front?
Suggestions anybody?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Well, I would remove the entire cab floor in one piece.  You will need to 
remove the steering column and heater tube.  There are three welds around the 
circumference of the heater tube to cut.  The sides and rear of the cab floor 
is the hardest to separate cleanly from the bus.  You can cut beyond what you 
need and then grind off the excess.  The front of the cab floor is actually 
the easiest.  The front of the cab floor rises from the flat part at an 
angle, then turns vertical and then forms a lip that the bottom of front kick 
panel fits into.  It is the vertical part (about 1/2 an inch or so) which is 
sport welded to the piece that sits on top of the front beam.  Do you need 
both the cab floor and the upper front beam piece?  If so, I would recommend 
a sharp air chisel with a pressure regulator set to 45 psi to separate the 
two.  It you don't need the front piece, and the front beam is already off, 
then just cut it out and clean it up later.  One last thing regarding the 
subframe that the emergency brake and gear shift are mounted to.  It might be 
easier to remove this subframe with the cab floor. There are lots of welds 
that hold these two pieces together and only a few places where the subframe 
attaches to the rest of the body.
