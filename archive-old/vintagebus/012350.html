Howdy Volks,

I recently had a '66 tranny put into my baby (with a little help from my friends). Seems that a friend did some messing around in the nosecone, an area I am totally unfamiliar with, and now that the bus is back together, the tranny won't work right. It freewheels ok in neutral, but when in gear it bogs down like something is in a bind. The local VW guru thinks that my friend lined up something wrong in the nosecone. Does anyone have any experience (and advice) in this area? Sure would appreciate some help...

luvya babe,
dave
