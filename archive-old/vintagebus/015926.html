Subject: painting hubcaps ?

hey now,
im preparing to paint the bus soon and have a mental picture in mind about 
how i want it to look. an interesting question has arisen. were the hubcaps 
ever painted to match a body color? are the ones ive seen just customized? i 
know some rims were two tone to match top and bottom color with chrome 
hubcaps, but i dont want chroms caps, there is nothing else chrome on buses. 
am going to paint top sand green, bottom palm green and wanted to paint rims 
sand green with palm hubcaps. anyone have any online pics of buses like 
this?
thanks again,

Bob Margiotti
