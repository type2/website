I've seen two safari antenna solutions: one way is an antenna with 2 90
degree bends, mounted on the side in the stock location.  The other is the
twin-post antenna mounted over the emblem  in the center.

I intend to put safaris on the '55 some day, so I mounted a barndoor-style
antenna right at the base of the windshield frame.

Another listmember named Rennie (sp) makes excellent safari wiper shaft
repros, which is another piece of the equation you still have to solve.

&gt;customer service and what everyone says it to be.  But anyway, on a 67 bus 
&gt;with safaris what kind of antanna was used and where was it placed?  If I am 
&gt;going out on a limb financially for the safaris themselves i just have to 
&gt;make sure that I have everything right!
