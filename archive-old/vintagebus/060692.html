Subject: Re: [VB] 205/75/15 Tires?

I run this size on the back of my 61.  They just barely squeeze past the flat 
wheel , then pump them upto desired psi.

&lt;&lt; I did a ot of research through the archives that suggested I could put this
 size tire on the rear of my bus.  I ordered the tires, they were Uniroyal
 Tiger Paws and my tire shop just called me.  They fit them on the rims but
 could not get them into the wheel wells.  Did I screw this up or am I
 missing something.  Any insight would be appreciated.
