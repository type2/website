  last weekend i started my bus for the first time. there 
 was a slight tapping noise it kind of sounded like a 
 loose valve. but it was getting late so i left it alone 
 til yesterday.i started the bus up and there it was so i 
 stopped it and re-adjusted the valves and it was still 
 there. (might i ad this a brand new mexican motor)so im 
 letting it idle and its still there then it gets louder 
 and louder then it seems to move (so i think) right 
 behind the pully.im now about freaking out, then it 
 disapears gone completely like it was never there.some 
 thing like this happend to me before but it was the carb 
 spout poped off and fell in the motor similer noise but 
 this time my carb spout was still there.dunno well next 
 week im gonna finish the breaks and go for a spin.

often when I adjust my valves, and then start it up, it sounds funky for a 
few minutes, then settles down.
