  if it has the standard upper vents in the rear of the bus,plus a second
additional set of vents it could be from australia.
where i believe they used two sets of upper vents.
-bench seat panels have one row of upper vents per side
-walk-thrus panels no upper vents
-australian bench seat panels two rows of upper vents per side
any aussies out there to confirm?
    
It does have the two sets of vents, one set located in the upper corners near
the roof.  Why would aussian panels need the added set above all others? 
Woody's observation would indicate it's related to the seating arrangement in
the cab and the likelyhood of Australians on board.  Hmm...
