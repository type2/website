Subject: Early/Late 67 Dash &amp; Backup Lights
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Chuck Notmeyer has a very early '67 Kombi.
Build date of July 6, 1966, VIN 000559,
probably on the first day of '67 production.

My Deluxe was built on October 5, VIN 036384.
Chuck's has backup lights, mine doesn't.
I have the later 7 1/4&quot; wide radio opening.
Don't know about his yet.

Any other data points out there I can add?
Come on people, we need to fill Clara's head
with almost useless bus trivia, such as 
when the radio opening and Bl were changed
in the 67 busses.


With Chuck's having backup lights, it blows
my theory that BL were added later.

My latest theory is that they found a stash
of non-BL rear corners in October and used them.
Whereas they wanted to showoff during the first
days of '67 production that these were the NEW
busses, and the BL beign the most visible.

On the dash oopening, the Split Guide indicates
that for those supplied without radios, the 
radio hole was blocked with a Beetle radio cover.

This implies that a Beetle radio of the correct
vintage would not only fit into the late '67 opening,
but would also be correct.

Jeff
'67 Deluxe Hardtop no backup lights
'67 Squareback with no backup lights
(the Sqbk BL were removed to pass inspections two decades ago.  
If they ain't there, ya can't tell that they don't work!)
(of course I still have them buried away . . . somewhere)
