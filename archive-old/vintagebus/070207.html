Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight parts

No I'm sorry, I have a 1967 and sometimes I forget that everone doesn't know her
as well as I do, it's (257) 144 268.  I understand the numbering system for my
bus, and since it a type 2 (obviously), 21 window (yeah baby), and a 1967 I just
left that part out, sorry for the confusion.  But it looks like you answered my
question about the headlight assemblies, they must be from a 1960 model.

Hi Tim &amp; Clementine,
Chassi # 614 456 = MAY1960, your chassi # of 144 268 sounds like a close
match to 1 144 303 = 05 AUG1963.
 Here is some questions to clinch if your bus is a 1963 or early 1964 model:
1.  Do you have the wide rear hatch used after 1963 model year?
2.  Do you have the flipper or push button style front door handles?
3.  Innie or outie vent louvers?
4. Do you have a bracket welded to the ceiling of the engine compartment on
the right side for 1500cc engine air cleaner?
