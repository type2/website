&gt;    I'm still trying to find out information on M-code #360...
&gt;
&gt;    This is listed on my '63 Standard Microbus (with M-codes for:
&gt;12V,1500cc engine, locking steering/ignition, walk-thru, US sealed
&gt;beams/red taillight lenses).

I have 360 on my 1959 single cab and both my 1959 panel vans.  It is 
an import code.

In NEATO's Old Bus Review #61 Jim Bryant had and article relating to 
NEATO's Old Bus Registry and some of the information gleaned from it.

There were 9 buses in the registry with m-code 360 (3 of them mine).  
The earliest in the registry was chassis number 20-267 605 and the 
latest was chassis number 1 124 797 (06/05/1963).
