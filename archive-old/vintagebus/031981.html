bus:

Naturally, after spending a few hours crawling around the bus I've better
determined its condition.  Happy to say my first prognosis wasn't too far off,
but it does have a few things that will need to be dealt with.  First, name
plate data:

21 01 9 = 21 January 1959
378 = ????????
130 = Type 24 without sunroof &amp; roof windows
175 = Overriders all models
U = USA
L = ??????? (Los Angeles?)
241 = Deluxe Microbus, cargo doors right, LHD
BGR = Beige Grey (yippee)
SR = Sealing Wax Red  (yippee again)
431172 = Chassis #

It also has the crashbox tranny which I was stoked about, only for value
reasons, not for practicality.

Anyone know what M Code 378 is?


Interior: dash opening has been slightly cut, basically the rounded corners
are now square.  Post holes are the same original diameter.  Rear and middle
seats are there but no bars on top.  Being a commercail guy, I'm not too up on
Deluxes, but I have a feeling there should be bars on both seats.  The middle
seat is full length with a split seat at the cargo doors.  All panels are
there but showing their age.  Headliner gone, not that it would have stayed.
Coat hooks were in a box in the back, along with half of the engine vent trim.
Visors are toast.  Jailbars are there.
 --  -- -  - -
visors should be hard board with a chromed metal edging- very hard to find-
like the 60  and back ones but with Chrome.    Seats should have bars on top.
See if there is a place for it to bolt on to the back of the rear seat- there
should be.    If you have the original crank hole apron I'd see if it would be
straightenable.   Panels can be flattened or material carefully peeled off and
glued to new backing hardboard.   Sounds really cool, mostly complete and
pretty solid.

378 is a US import code- for us type specs

I really like split case trannys.   I doubt you have a crash box one, which
was early 53 and back (to about ch# 20- 49,000  I think), but the later split
case is synchronised in 2nd, 3rd and 4th, you need to be at a full and
complete stop to go into 1st or reverse.   I havn't decided if I'll find a
split case for my truck or put a big nut 4.12r&amp;p tunnel case in it.    I
really like split case for driving.  but that's just me.
