Subject: Re: [VB] Rear spring plate adjustment

roll the truck forward.   The wheels tuck in when you lift it up- this is 
normal on a swing axle set up.

&lt;&lt; Hello,
 
 I just finished installing a straight axle kit on my 63 single cab and when 
 I set it down off of the jack stands the wheels are tucked in (negative 
 camber?) Which way do I need to move the plates to get zero camber? I used 
 an inclinometer to set the plates at 7 degrees at the recommendation of 
 wolfgangs do I need to go up or down?
 
 The engine is in and I bounced on the back of the truck to try to get it to 
 sit down more but it seems like it has completely settled.
 
 Thanks,
 Bob
