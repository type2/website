Subject: Molded windshield seals

    They are finally on the way, lets hope they made lefts and rights this
time, moulded corner winshield seals for your split bus, HECHO in Germany.
They are being air frieghted over and should have them in stock in the next
2 weeks. 
    These will be for sale once I have test fit them to make sure they are
correct. For those of you following this saga, it started over 2 years ago
with me sending NOS winshield seals to be copied and then made. Hans had too
much beir and decided that mirrored means 2 of the same so the mould was
made for left side only! This has be corrected and my source in Germany
sears that there are lefts and rights. Photos to follow soon
