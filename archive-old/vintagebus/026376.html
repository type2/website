Subject: [VB] AC Outlet and Gas Heater
Message-ID: &lt;3842B920.BF4662BE_at_lehigh_dot_edu&gt;

My AC outlet is on the drivers side, close to the door, why would the
wires be in the engine compartment? Probably can't answer that, but
maybe you can. Also, how would I know that I had a gas heater? Thanks
for your help.

Chris,

These most likely are the wires for the AC outlet inside your camper.
They
run along the left side of the bus to the exterior AC inlet plug.  64-65
it
is installed in the left rear corner, and 66-67 in the left side of the
bus.  There are some inconsistencies though.  I have a 67 that has the
plug
inlet at the left corner like my 65.  All the other 67's I've seen have
been
located just aft of the drivers side door 1/4  the way up the side.

If the inlet plug is still there, there should also be a rubber boot
that
would have covered the wires that attached to the plug from the inside.

Should only be 3 wires.  The 4th might have been for a gas heater...not
sure
though.
