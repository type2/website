&gt; Hi all,
&gt;   My '59 panel van driver's door is beyond repair...Anyone on or near the
&gt; East coast of the US have one they wouldn't mind parting with?  Heck
anyone
&gt; in the 48 contiguous states have one?
&gt;   I also need a deck lid and rear apron...Not as bad as the front driver
&gt; door though.
&gt; TIA for any leads!
