I live in Miami, Its cold today, I put on long sleeves, windows open, no
thermostat, no heat, ran smooth from start (maybe even a little smoother
than usual, thanx choke) prob take off the long sleeves for the ride home,
maybe go to the beach this weekend and put on my footy pedals.

&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;Why did VW decide that the thermostats were unnecessary in 
&gt;&gt;mexico??? Its not ALWAYS 80+.
&gt;&gt;Andy&gt;&gt;
&gt;     
&gt;who knows? maybe built in obsolesce to sell more vw's? but eric &amp; barb are 
&gt;right, to get maximum life from you engine you need to use the thermostat!
