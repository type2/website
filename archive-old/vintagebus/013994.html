Subject: [VB] clutch adjustment tool
Message-Id: &lt;199911141932.MAA06226_at_green-dome.village_dot_org&gt;

So I managed to think up and fabricate a useful little tool for making
it easier to adjust the clutch.  The main problem I've always had was
in needing to take enough tension off the cable to allow me to turn
the adjustor (I've had three-week bruises on my fingers from this sort
of thing before).  Today, while trying to figure out how to thread the
adjustor onto a new cable by myself, I had a bit of an inspiration.

The basic problem is needing to reach up and pull the throw-out arm
forward while simultaneously having a hand curled around that arm,
fiddling with the adjustor.  With my build and bus combination, this
is just not a possible thing.  However, there *is* room to guide a
long hook up between the frame and the tranny and use it to pull on
the arm.  I grabbed some 1x2 I had laying around (about 2, 2.5 feet
long), liberated a moderately large screwhook from one of the shelves
in the garage, and mounted the hook in the end of the 1x2 (drilling a
pilot hole helped a lot on this, btw).  The hook's at about a 30
degree angle relative to the thick axis of the 1x2, which corresponds
to the angle I have to hold my wrist at while pulling on the board.
Worked beautifully.

Sometime in the future, I plan on putting some gripping knurls into
the wood, so I can get a solid grip and not need to worry about
splinters or the like if things slip.

Another alternative that would probably be even easier to use would be
one of those ratcheting tie-down straps that you can get at motorcycle
and car parts places.  I'd expect the come-along style ones to work
best, since you don't really have the maneuvering room for tightening
the friction ones.  These would have the advantage of being anchored
at both ends, not needing to be in a straight line, and leaving both
hands free for bashing into sharp edges and such - hook one end
to the throw-out arm, the other to a convenient spot on the frame,
tighten, and go to work.
