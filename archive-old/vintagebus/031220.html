Subject: [VB] re:spare parts

&lt;&lt;either!There is one aircooled mechanic in Anchorage though,the guy
seems
like a real ass, but he has been around for years and seems to know his
stuff.&gt;&gt;

But in his defense. . . can you imagine dealing with vw nuts day after
day after day after day. He hhe. I mean, I know a good many that have
big hearts and loan roof racks at the drop of a hat and all that, but
more than a few of you are just totally of your rockers. Kill the
messenger if you wish, but I have been to these bus thingies. . . I know
of what I speak. :) And not too sure I am excempt from this criticism,
either.
