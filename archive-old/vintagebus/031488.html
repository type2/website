Subject: Starter information

While digging through my stash of starters,,that seem to have become buried in
walnuts!, I found a couple of starters that I am puzzled about. The walnuts, and
their owner and I met in the Dark, but that is another story!

Starter [1]
6 volt starter, self supporting drive end, similar to an automatic trans.
starter.
Both ends of the motor are cast aluminum, and they have part# 211-911-255 B on
them, I wire brushed and sanded the steel body, but couldn't locate any evidence
of ID markings,,

[2]
6 volt starter,, it has the correct drive gear and shaft size, but the overall
motor is larger than the rest of the 6 volt starter I have,
I realize Bosch made many , and I cleaned the case off and it looks like 8
volts,
Double checking proves that the solenoid clearly says 6v.... but the motor body
says 8 volt!
it also says AL/EGF 0.6/61.5  then below that is 8 v
The body of the motor is about 4&quot; in diameter, where the rest are 3 5/8&quot;
I understand using an 8 volt battery will allow more current in a 6 volt system
with out really having to change anything else,, But I am puzzled why this motor
would have a 8 volt rating?
