Subject: Warning

I highly recomend not buying anything on ebay from a guy named Bill Webb, from Austrailia. He runs or is part of &quot;carsonline_dot_com.au&quot; and sells stuff on ebay. He took me for $81.44 when he charged me twice for a set of ambulance fans for a bay. I have been getting the run-around and BS excuses since Feb 8th. You know how it goes: &quot; we ran it through&quot;, &quot;Bill is out of the office&quot;, &quot;I will personally send it out&quot; (almost three weeks ago!), Bill had a cra wreck a month ago and his jaw is messed up&quot; (I have talked to him on the phone twice!) blah, blah, blah.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
