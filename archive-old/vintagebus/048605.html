Subject: Re: [VB] bug not bus on GG Bridge
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

As far as building a bus tow bar, it really isn't that complicated, it is
built very similar to the bug tow bar, only longer.  The problem with
manufacturing one is the liability involved.  Just think what would happen
if you built one, sold it to someone who did not hook it up properly and
while towing their bus down the local interstate it came loose, crossed
over to the other side and hit a car with a mother and a bunch of children
and killed half of them!  Not enough insurance in the world could handle
that problem and patch things up.  Not to mention the guilt trip you would
have.


&gt;To further this thread: if there are no jigs are their any drawings, plans
&gt;or specifications for a Bus towbar then.  This is something that has been on
&gt;my list since we bought my 63 Panel.
