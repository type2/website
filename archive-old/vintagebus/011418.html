Dear Listees...

It has been good to see a great many of our List members air out their 
valid opinions and experiences concerning SOTO and it's leader / 
owner? / President Dave Heard.  You can't help but notice that the 
vast majority of posts have been overwelmingly negative.  I hope 
Dave is listening in and will give us his side of the story on all of this.
 
Steve Fronczek, it was nice and fair to hear of your positive experience 
concerning his credit of the swap space for Dawn next year.  Now, I 
guess I should bite my tounge and sit quietly on the sidelines, but 
being human, I do have to say something about your closing statement  
&quot;IMOH slaming a person without any huge justified reason isn't called 
for on the list.  Reserve it for P-mail.&quot;  

First off, this E-mail list is a VERY appropriate forum for discussing 
these matters, in fact ANY matters concerning pre-1968 Transporters 
and anything to do with them.  And if you think about it for a while and 
re-read all the SOTO postings from many different sources, I think it's 
very apparent that THERE IS reason to critique what many have 
called a business, but what is described by some as a Club.  Jeff 
Walters started SOTO out on the right track as &quot;THE&quot; Club to join if 
you were focused on the Split windshield Bus.  The dues were 
reasonable, the newsletter was on time and had Bus and event info, 
classified ads, tech bulletins, and great old photos.  Ask anyone who 
was a member during the &quot;glory days&quot; when Jeff organized SOTO.  
The Anniversary meets were amazing!!!  I have been to most of them 
and I was at the one that had 463? split windshield Busses in 
attendance.  Members in general seemed delighted with the Club.  

After Jeff passed the torch to Steve Nye and eventually on to Dave, 
SOTO seemed to evolve more and more into a Club in which you 
would benifit most if you were Southwest based, more to the point, 
California based.  Nothing really wrong with that, but long distance 
members depended almost solely on their only link, the newsletter,  
which became fairly eratic.  Out of frustration, a group of SOTO 
members in the Boston area a long, long time ago split off with a 
different idea and formed NEATO (NorthEast Association of 
Transporter Owners).  Determined to keep a wider focus, Tom 
Brioullette and friends created and edited (and he still does) an 
incredible, worldwide focused, Split Bus newsletter with the most 
awesome Splitty classified ads.  Tightly linked with LiMBO, these 
two Clubs even created their own &quot;Tourist and Transporter Directory&quot; 
as a tremendous benefit of membership to assist it's members while 
out on the road.  NEATO in the USA, the Split Screen Van Club in 
England and Bulli Kartei of Germany embraced each other and 
co-ordinate projects together.  

NEATO is not by any means perfect!  Actually our own newsletter 
is a litte behind right now, but is getting back on track.  But no one 
person runs, controls or owns this Club.  We have regularly elected 
regularly elected Club Officers, a Board of Directors, and everyone 
is an unpaid volunteer.  We have By-Laws, a treasurer who accounts 
and disburses Club funds, a lot of which is put back into co-operative 
projects which benefit the membership such as several special 
Brekina collectible toys, calendars, and the recently released Split 
Bus guide.  We have many active chapters, and hold many NEATO 
and NEATO / LiMBO Bus events all over the country.  

Now I didn't write all this just to be singing the praises of NEATO vs. 
SOTO.  My point, I guess is, why did SOTO go in the direction it has?  
What is Dave's / SOTO's goal.  How can he / SOTO help the Split 
Bus hobby the best, help the most enthusiasts.  There is plenty of 
room for both our Bus Clubs in the USA, hell, maybe even for more!  
Maybe I shouldn't dream for improvement in SOTO, because 
NEATO has gained many happy new members from SOTO in the 
past.  But I would like to see SOTO improve, perhaps by focusing 
on it's geographical region, distributing it's responsibilities and 
control to elected officers, volunteers, etc.  Not sold but passed on.  
Anyway, I hope that things do improve for everyone in SOTO.  

In closing, as long as I've opened my big mouth, I'll share a wish 
several of us Split Bus nuts have had over beers, usually around 
campfires late at night at Bus events.  Wouldn't it be nice if someday 
all of the Split Bus enthusiasts in America were united again as one 
Club here in the States?  Boy, am I dreamin' or what?  

Well, if the rumors were to be true about Dave possibly wanting to 
move on, how about it Dave?  How about it?
