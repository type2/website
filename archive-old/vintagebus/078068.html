Subject: RE: [VB] TMI - carmel brown

TMI does not make anything close to this. Doug Delinger from Upolstery Haus
had some of the fabric and made a few sets of door panels for 58 model
years. You can contact Doug eother at Upolstery Haus or Transporter
Restoration. I am sure you have seen his woek, KING of the 40 to 60 K Deluxe
buses.

Hey Folks

Does anyone know of a source for Carmel Brown seat covers.  Does TMI make
em?
If so - are they close to the original colour?
