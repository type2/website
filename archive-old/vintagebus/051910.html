 In addition to the previous post, I have (after some more research) found it 
 necessary to say that the solex 34-pict 3 carb is paired with an 009 
 distributor. Does this complicate matters?

34 pict carbs imo are a pita.   but you can try cleaning it out- wouldn't 
hurt.  What are the symptoms?   does it run smooth after the bus warms up?
