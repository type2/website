I know this guy. I wouldn't buy anything from him, especially if it had been repainted. He's a nice guy and all, doesn't really know buses too well. (just that he can turn them for a profit) The painter he uses for his projects doesn't care too much about quality. He does paint jobs fast and they don't last. If anyone wants.... I can go check it out and maybe find out if it's real....
You didn't hear it from me... 



Thanks,

Brian
