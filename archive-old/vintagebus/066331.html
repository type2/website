Subject: RE: [VB] FS: T3 oil cooler

  I don't feel like counting the fins but I would guess 20 to 30% more fins.
There is a noticable difference in the 2 coolers

Is there more than one style of T3 cooler?  Early?  Late?  I've heard of
the &quot;tight finned&quot; T3 cooler...are they all &quot;tight finned&quot; or just some.
 What constitutes &quot;tight finned&quot;?  How many rows??
