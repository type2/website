Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

If you want to get really picky, you can match the 'A' or 'AAA' string
with the year that the bus was sold. Talk about Type A! 

Anyone know the correlation of years to letters? I have a 'Y' plate for
my 11/59 commercial and it's not correct. The guy I bought it from has
an 'S' plate set also, which I understand is appropriate for that year.

Don't forget boys and girls that to be correct for your pre '63
&quot;commercial&quot; vehicle ie: bus, you want the black on yellow plates with 6
digits spaced like this:   A  ##  ### .  The other type  like:  AAA  ###
are for cars.

&gt;  Todd,
&gt; Your plates are black letters on plates. These are the last series of
plates
&gt; you can use as YOM plates.
&gt; These ended in 62.
&gt; Starting in 63, the plates were black with yellow letters. And the
order
&gt; reversed. Yellow w/black letters were number/letter, i.e. 123 ABC.
Black
&gt; w/yellow letters were letter/number, i.e. ABC 123.
&gt; You cannot use a black w/yellow plate on a 63 and up unless you can
prove
they
&gt; are the correct original plates from when the vehicle was 1st
registered.
