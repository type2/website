&gt; That makes sense... hadn't thought of that, thanks. I was afraid it might come

I'd say keep hitting it with Liquid Wrench for a week if necessary, and
the occasional moderate tapping, to help get the oil in there. It
dissolves rust, and just needs to get in there - the vibration helps to
get it in. I'd leave banging for last. Let the stuff soak in for many
days, keeping more going into the joint. At some point, enough rust will
be softened, so it should come free without too much shock. If you still
need to hit it, then a weeks worth of penetrating oil should lessen the
required hits.

When you finally get it loose, Permatex silver anti-sieze lube should be
used liberally on the replacement part, as well as anywhere else that you
want to keep accessable in the future - rear axle splines, shifter
couplings, engine tin screws, shock absorber bolts, rear bearing bolts,
RGB bolts, everything.
