My 1960 DC 611005 built (according to m plate 16/05/0) has the one piece
gates, I belive these to be original, it also has the high hindge wedge
things. The M codes are 361 (which according to the decoder says, 88 amp
battery,chrome hubcaps, ready for CAMPER? and swivel seat) I don't think so
and M code 207 which is hoops and canvas of which I have the hoops but no
canvas. Also the dating chart says this bus was an April bus but the build
date shows 16th of May. Does the M code plate get stamped upon completion of
the build or during?? or is it when ready for delivery?

According to Michael Steinke of the Bulli Kartei Bus Club in Germany,
M code 544 is &quot;Something special that didn't come at the assembly
line--perhaps the cut
singlecab gates (544 - KW 544, KW means &quot;Kundendienstwerkstatt&quot;--&quot;service
room&quot;, a special
place for conversions done by Volkswagen itself).&quot;
    He also mentioned that he knows of a double cab that is 4 months older
than this one
with the same gate impressions (long, short, long) made of singlecab gates
and a double
cab 2 months newer than this one with the specially molded double cab gates
with all 3
impressions equal.
