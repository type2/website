Hey gang,

I picked up some seat belts at a swap meet that were open ended, meaning
they weren't stitched into the anchors.  I've been looking for some long
ones for the middle seat in my deluxe and these belts are plenty long.  I'm
just wondering now, where do I take these things to get that DOT stitching?

thanks and buckle-up;o)
