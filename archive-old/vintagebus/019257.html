Here are links to pics of the mesh grey cab divider
set in DARTHVW. (BTW I got this set from Dave
Gillingham on the list for FREE out of that rolled bus
everyone thumbed their nose at, which turned out to be
a nice complete deluxe with all parts including both
seat kickpanels, jailbars, 6 perfect popouts, strong
1600 DP etc. Not bad for $950, so I guess you can get
a great PARTS bus for under 1000)

Anyway...

A Brian said, there are THREE panels, one large curved
panel which fits over the spare tire hump, and two
other panels, one on each side of this &quot;hump&quot; panel.
There is a metal-frame shelf which screws into the
bulkhead and rests atop the center panel, a hardboard
and vinyl-covered shelf sits in the frame, there's a
rubber trim around it.

I think the most important piece is the bottom
aluminum channel which is riveted into the bulkhead at
the top of the rubber kickpanel (the rubber kickpanel
makes up the bottom 6 inches of the bulkhead). This
aluminum strip goes the full width of the bulkhead,
and curves around the lower part of the hump. The
bottom edges of all three panels rest in this channel.

The two side panels are riveted to the bulkhead with a
series of rivets. The center panel only has one rivet
in the center, but the sides of this panel are tucked
under the two side panels.


I have seen on Wolfsburg West's site that they plan to
have this divider set soon, but without the chrome
strips.

MESH GREY: I think the two colors of that deluxe
interior that year were Platinum Mesh and Mesh Gray.

Both were basically a solid color of vinyl on the top
and bottom 1/3 of the panel, with a &quot;mesh&quot; sort of
check pattern of white and the vinyl color in the
center 1/3 Each section is bordered by a chrome strip
about the size of a pencil.

Mesh grey is shown there. Platinum mesh was a silvery
(platinum) solid color with the platinum and white
mesh-over center section.

That concludes this lecture.
