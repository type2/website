Subject: Re: RE: [VB] Venting a bit &lt;long&gt;

I want to chime in here for just a second if I may regarding the current thread about lack of community and helping each other out. What you are saying is right to an extent but I am here to tell you all that the true spirit of the list and community is alive and well.  Through simple posts to the list in the past year, I have conducted the following business:  Got a complete 75 westy with a burnt valve for FREE from a listmember.  After using the interior, Gave same Westy for FREE to another listmember.  I gave away (ie FREE) a working Riviera electric refridgerator to a fellow listmember (Nick Barbato) because he had a Riviera, and I didn't want this fridge to rot away in my barn. I Posted that I was looking to purchase a gas heater for my bus, Will Anderson came through for me with a BN4, price? An oil cooler, a vac distributor, and a wiper assembly from an old bus I had laying around.  When I needed some diaphragm material for said Bn4, I posted to the list and Markus Bahn!
emann came through for me with some Buna Rubber he had, price: $FREE$.  The heater is now up and running!!  There have also been a number of other little things that Listmembers have helped me out with which I cannot recall names for right now.
I think you are right when you talk about the &quot;others&quot; who do not share the spirit.  However, I take comfort in knowing the fact that in 6 months or a year from now, those &quot;others&quot; will be long gone, but I'd bet you a sink from a 75 Westy that everybody I have mentioned in this post will still be here!!!
Keep it real!!  John Baker

Hey John,

I know what you are saying and agree totally.

&quot;I also have noticed that it is not as much a community as it used to be. Oh
sure people are on this list and there are lots that offer good advice and
help, but there are others that it is NOT about VWs and the people that
drive them. There are still a lot of people that are passionate about busses
and the people that drive them and more power to you! But there are &quot;the
others&quot; too.&quot; 

There are loads of really cool people on this list that you do not hear from
much, but once you get into the camping/VW scene you get to know them pretty
quick.  The best medicine is to go out in your local community and hang out
with a couple VW bus brothers and sisters and you will have enough karma to
last a year!  I am always amazed by the VW community and the sub-culture
surrounding it, in a good way of course.  

Since you are in Atlanta area definitely join the Peachstate Transporters...
I think somehow related to NEATO, but not sure.  No dues or anything, just
cool people hanging out together.  In the summer we hang out a lot.

Also if you are in the south-east or anywhere in the world actually!  The
www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com is great for VW community information and has a
relaxed mailing list for all sorts of VW stuff that is bus related.
 
... There are some people into VWs to make money on gar-bay and all that
which is sad.  But it is their right to do what they want...  Just do not do
it around me!  Of course within any group there are a few people who think
that way.  And they are mostly good people, but they miss the concept of
what the bus scene is all about...  These are usually the same people who
think The Dead were about drugs!  And of course it one of &quot;these people&quot; is
in need of help I will gladly help in any way I can, but I expect them to be
reaching for their wallet when I am done to show some appreciation &quot;on their
own terms&quot; of value :)  I have not run into this situation yet luckily.  All
the people I have helped out so far were in the right karma zone and knew
what it was about to help a brother out.

And I know by now everyone is thinking &quot;hippie&quot;, but that is not me either
:)

Just keep in mind too that the internet is a large marketing tool in some
ways and also many of the list members make their living selling VW stuff,
which is cool by me no flame here.  

Now on the other hand if you want to see some people who think junk is made
out of gold just visit a Porsche site sometime!  Woof, used junk sometimes
and pricey too!  Good people there, just that whole scene is a little whacky
on valuing used stuff. 


Happy Journeys,
