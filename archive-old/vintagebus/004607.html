&gt; Aluminum against steel should be fine.  The crank is made of steel and it
&gt; rubs on the bearings just fine.  Now, the finish on the flywheel might not
&gt; be suitable for contact with the bearing

Ack.

&gt; Dissimilar to each other.  If both of the parts of the bearing are made of
&gt; the same metal they will gall, since the metals will bond microscopically
&gt; and tear upon startup.

But they don't gall unless you load them by depressing the clutch before
they are oiled, in which case they will do just that. Once they have been
oiled, they can handle load. When dry they will fuse.

&gt;
&gt; It's pretty easy to figure out.  The shims have a larger surface areas and
&gt; are made of the same material, so they will have more friction between
&gt; them than the shim-to-crank interface.  Most of the motion will take place
&gt; at the thrust bearing.  As I recall, the thrust bearing is also grooved to
&gt; deliver oil to the thrust surface, which would also reduce friction here.
&gt;
The shims have the same surface area as the thrust surface of the flywheel
and are made of the same material, steel. Maybe a different grade, but
steel. I agree that 'most' of the motion probably takes place at the thrust
bearing, but it is obviously not all. All of the parts are separated by oil
in operation, so they are oblivious to the fact that they are made of the
same metal. The oil neither knows nor cares of the molecular weight of each
part.

&gt;
&gt; No, the oil is delivered to the grooves in the thrust bearing even at
&gt; relatively low pressure.  Once in the groove, it is pulled between the
&gt; shim and the bearing by hydrodynamic forces caused by the motion of the
&gt; bearing and the geometry of the groove.  This causes the shim to ride on
&gt; an oil film created by the wedging action of the shim and bearing.  The
&gt; shim-shim interfaces lack this groove, so the oil just isn't delivered
&gt; there.

The oil is clearly delivered to the shims. It isn't positively injected, but
it is delivered. Disassemble an engine that has run 5 minutes that was
assembled with dry shims and you will see this. I will assume you didn't
mean to say the motion of the bearing in this case because that would be a
terminal condition. It would appear to me that the oil film separated shims
are indeed a reduction, in spite of your engineer-ese. The grooves are a
positive oil loading device, but I think that is for when you maintain the
load for too long and the oil film is driven out between the shims. Kind of
a fail safe, because so much material is removed from the thrust bearing
that it is the weakest link in the chain. The shims when they go in are not
a mirror polished part, they can have scratches, hone marks, or whatever,
but when they come out they will have a uniform oil layer, will spin freely
on each other and will be finely polished. I would say that this does not
occur because they are spinning in lockstep with the flywheel as you say,
but because they spin on each other with oil between. That's my story and
I'm sticking to it.
