Hi!

I just spent an hour fruitlessly searching the Web, and Michele has tried to
explain to sewing stores, Wal-Mart (where the lady said that she knew what
we're looking for but they don't carry them..), hardware stores, etc. what
we're looking for....in desperation, we turn to The List...

We are going to make curtains for our Westy...we have the track from the
front sliding curtains, but all the little sliding plastic pieces are
broken.  Can someone please tell us what these are called and where to get
enough of them to make curtains with?

Thanks,
Gene
