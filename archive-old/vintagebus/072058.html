Subject: [VB] wiper motors two of them?

Hi again-

my 64 standard chassis # 13xxxxx has two wiper motors.  I am confused as I thought they had one oval one with a connecting rod setup.  The motors are cylindrical and attach to a gear box.  The motor drives the lever assembly with a worm gear.

The outside of the gear box says:

                        American Bosch ( in a circular symbol )
                          Type WWF
                      and 6V

I have only removed the passenger side one but the driver's side 
looks identical , anyone know what's going on here?
