&lt;&lt; Hi,
 
 I need a front passenger door for a 64 with the flip out handle (I can use
 my old handle) as well as a loaf 15 gallon gas tank. Can anyone recommend a
 junk yard in LA/Orange County area where I can pick these up? Does anyone
 have either of these items you want to sell?
  &gt;&gt;
I don't know where, but the early 64s with the pull out handle take the same 
door as the mid 61s through dec 64= the re is an indent wher ethe handle 
goes.  Only difference is on the drivers side the handle takes the T series 
key, but the door itself is same as mid 61 through dec 64
