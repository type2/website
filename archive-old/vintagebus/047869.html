&lt;&lt; I have a 67 Double Cab.  While performing a brake adjustment on Sunday, I
 noticed the master cylinder boot was damp, leading me to believe the master
 is leaking.  The pedal is still solid, though.  Is this something that can 
be rebuilt, like a wheel cylinder, or am I better off biting the bullet and 
buying a new one?&gt;&gt;
Hi Danno,
If yours is a dual then you can both easily, and safely rebuild it.  Single 
circuit MC can be rebuilt but you do not have the safety of redundancy of the 
dual MC in case there is something you missed while rebuilding the single.  
All too often all that is wrong with either one is they are clogged up with 
sludge from road dust.  So take it apart, clean out all the gunk, and polish 
by finger with 200-400 wet/dry sandpaper any minor corrosion in the bore, and 
reassemble.
  If you take apart your master, and wheel cylinders to do this type of 
cleaning every time you replace the brake shoes (About every 20-30,000 
miles.) on your daily driver the system will last over 100,000 miles, and 10 
years without any problems.  Doing all of this also tends to happen every two 
to three years for us which works perfect for getting rid of any water that 
has collected in the brake fluid.  Which otherwise would cause corrosion, and 
possible brake failure due to the water turning into vapor!   Eric&amp;Barb
 
 Also, my front brakes require adjustment every month or so, I am missing the
 little tabs that hold the adjusters, is this my problem there?
