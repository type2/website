&gt;First off, admins, if this is a Friday post, please flog me. I thought it

&gt;There's this thing that can be used to disable computers in warfare, I'm 
&gt;told, called ELP, or Electro-Magnetic Pulse...or something like that. I'm 
&gt;thinking this would also disable about 98+% of the cars on the road. My 
&gt;question is, would this also disable a bus. If so, which parts are most 
&gt;vulnerable and is there a way to assure the viability of spares.

I remember in the 70s people with CB radios and high-power (1000 watt)
linear amplifiers were able to kill the engine on VWs with the brain
box-type fuel injection.   They would pull up next to the car and key the
microphone, the brain box would get confused and the car would shut down.
The effect would only last as long as the transmission, and there appeared
to be no lasting effects.  Great fun to sit at a traffic light and kill a
car every time it re-starts...I'm sure this is the same principle as the
EMP bomb.

This should not affect any vehicle with a standard ignition system.  If the
pulse is large enough to permanently harm the battery or other components,
spares are going to be your last worry...
