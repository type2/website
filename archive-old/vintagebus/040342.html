Subject:  RE: [VB] Taillight Dilemma


Greetings All, 

John,

believe it ot not, if it is all wired as per the diagrams
then you probably have an earthing problem!  Make sure
all the lights are well earthed, run an 'extra' non-stock
(eek) earthing wire if needed.....I think thi smay well solve
your problem....

Subject: [VB] Taillight Dilemma


I'm having trouble with my passenger side taillight on my 6-volt '66 Westy.
I noticed last summer that the taillight was very dim and the turn signal
and brake light were operating sporadically and they were very dim also.
When I bought the bus someone had spliced into the taillight wires for a
trailer light plug. I thought this might have something to do with it so I
dismantled the wiring for the trailer plug and removed it. No change. I
removed the taillight and found that the plastic fitting into which the bulb
screws was broken. I bought a new taillight housing from Ronnie and wired it
up. This hasn't helped.
When I took the taillight out I saw that there are two red and white wires
spliced together for a common female plug. There is also a striped black and
white wire plus a wire that leads to the license plate light fixture. There
are two prongs and a ground prong sticking out from the taillight housing.
The way it's wired now, when I turn on the turn signal all the lights in the
back blink very slightly. What am I doing wrong???
I've looked at Thom's wiring diagram plus the one in my Bentley manual and
I'm sorry to say that I haven't been able to come up with the solution.
The driver's side taillight is much brighter and the turnsignal and brake
light work as they should. I haven't had someone available to check the
brake light on the passenger side yet.
Any suggestions?
TIA
John Flowers
