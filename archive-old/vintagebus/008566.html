I do not believe my Jan, 1955 Kombi has the correct headlight assemblies.
I wish to locate a 'correct' set.  I have located a pair of what should be
original '58 lenses.  Are they different than pre-March, 1955?  I know '55
should be Hella and 'fluted' but other than that, what is the difference?
Is it just the glass lens or more than that?  I will be staying with the
sealed beam setup, since I have a US-delivered vehicle.

BTW, could someone give a quick reference on the differences between
fluted and non-fluted?

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
