&lt;&lt; If you want to have a 1600, seems best to stay away from the 3.88, or you 
 will lose power up hills.  If you want to have the 3.88, best to have a 
 bigger motor.  &gt;&gt;
 Hi Volks,
 We would have to disagree about the 1600cc not being good enough.  &gt;&gt;

I have to agree w/ eric&amp;barb.  I have a 3.88 w/ a 1600 and can pull my '61 
Flip seat Westy just fine, but it does have a dual carb setup w/ a 110 cam.  
It doesn't take much more than a stock setup to pull that 3.88, even with a 
full camper interior.
