I was *unaware* of that!  Kinda like the plates for the striker plates, or

&gt; All this talk about putting originals in your bus. I have 1 question for
&gt;you all. How did you insert the original screw plate to mount the Safaris in
&gt;your buses???? I would bet that 95% of you don't even know about this
&gt;moveable plate that mounts the windows, you  just drill and screw, right!
