&lt;&lt; I am installing my rebuilt transaxle today, when I looked in the shop
 manual it showed 72 to 87 ft / lb. for the correct torque for the redux.
 box bolts.  I have tightened them to about 50 ft/lbs and they seem
 really tight!  I sure don't want to strip out any threads, does anyone
 have some advise on the correct torque? 
 Thanks for your help.
  &gt;&gt;
yes- about 80 ft lbs.   like yer lug nuts should be 80 ft lbs.   If the redux 
nuts are too loose they can fall out and that can mess things up, but you 
don't want to strip it either.

not too tight, not too loose, but just right.   thats why they have 
recommended torques.
