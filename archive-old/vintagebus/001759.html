  OK, I'm heading to work this morning thinking about finally having all my new parts to put the new 3:88 tranny in my 61 Westy, all new bearings for the RBs and new inserts in the RB-to-spring plates, can't wait to get started, when 'pow' my clutch cable breaks on my beater 58 bug/Dumas kit stake bed truck!
  So the bus has to wait for tomorrow, I guess the 58 got jealous of all the attention. It is going on three years of restoration. &quot;IT WILL BE ON THE ROAD FOR THE JEROME CAMPOUT!&quot;
  Back to work! I hate cluch cables!
