Dave,

Thank you for taking the trouble to write.  The misquote is a minor point, 
something all of do now and then -- and all of us understand as being not 
worth pointing out.  Please don't worry about it.  But I felt I should raise 
the issue in this case not because of the misquote but because of the hazard 
inherent in by-pass oil filtration systems.

The bottom line is that, than helping your engine, a by-pass oil filter may 
destroy it.  This can occur when the flow of oil from the filter is blocked.  
This can happen if the filter you are using does not have an internal 
by-pass.  (Today, most filters do.)  That's the worse case.

The most serious fault of by-pass oil coolers comes from the pressure-drop 
across them.  The VW engine is designed to direct the output of the pump 
through the relatively low-restriction cooler circuit when a rise in oil 
temperature lowers the viscosity of the oil to the point where the control 
valve is actuated.  Adding an oil filter to this circuit upsets the way the 
valve works.  The oil filter and added plumbing (especially if low quailty 
(ie, 'soft' ) hose is used) acts like a pressure reservoir, causing the 
control valve to oscillate or hunt.  The oscillation can cause the oil 
temperature to rise still further because less oil gets through the cooler 
and, if the magnitude of the osciallation is great enough, will even by-pass 
oil back to the sump.

 Even when the oil filter's by-pass is open (ie, the filter isn't filtering), 
the presence of the added plumbing, the filter-base and the filter itself 
represent a considerable restriction.  When the restriction goes up, the flow 
goes down.  When the flow drops, you will end up with a very hot-running 
engine.  Adding a large, external oil cooler will mask this problem... for a 
while.  But given the right conditions -- hot day, heavy load and high speed 
-- it will catch up to you.  The risks are simply not justified for a system 
which at best, can only filter some of the oil some of the time. 

(Following the introduction of the after-market by-pass oil filter kit in the 
mid-1950's -- and seeing the disasterous results -- gave rise to the 
Conventional Wisdom that adding an oil filter would cause your bug to run 
hot.  This belief was still common currency a quarter-century later.  When 
resurrecting Grendel, one of the local VW 'experts' -- a lad of twenty or so 
-- took the trouble to point out all the many mistakes I'd built in to the 
engine I carried north, including the one about filters making VW engines run 
hot.  I didn't bother to correct him.  Indeed, I doubt I even could -- 
Conventional Wisdom is powerful stuff.)  

[Looking back on the incident, I wish a real expert HAD been available -- 
perhaps he would have noticed the bone-headed mistake I made when installing 
the alternator :-)  

Another common problem with by-pass oil filters is that when the filter 
becomes clogged and the by-pass DOES work... you're left with the increased 
restriction but NO oil filtering.  This was probably the most common case 
with the early installations since most of the engines of that era had been 
fed a strict diet of non-detergent oil.   But what was never explained was 
how QUICKLY this could occur. When they began using high detergent oil, as 
explained in the filter-kit instructions , the dissolved sludge could clog 
the filter in a matter of days.  (The instructions also said the engine 
should be flushed but such nicities were usually ignored :-)  

(A blocked filter can also occur with full-flow systems but in those cases 
the restrictions are much less and cooling is not effected.  The typical 
pop-off for a filter/pump, or for Berg's pump cover having a pop-off valve is 
90 psi.)

But the most serious problem with by-pass oil filtering schemes is probably 
psychological (!)  Oil filters are supposed to improve things, to make an 
engine last longer.  Seeing one installed there in the engine compartment -- 
and knowing nothing about the nature of the installation -- causes most 
people to believe all they need do is change the filter occasionally and they 
will double the life of the engine.  It comes as a terrible shock to discover 
their engine may be wearing out FASTER because of the filter.

Unless they're NOS Phreaks, of course :-)
