&gt; The benefit of the PWM controller is you would have continuously
&gt; variable wiper speeds between off and warp speed,

Maybe.  I don't think the 555 circuits can go all the way to 0% or 100%
duty cycle, but they can get pretty close.

&gt; Has anyone tried using PWM instead of a voltage drop?  Any reasons why
&gt; it wouldn't work in a bus?

One problem with both of the circuits you linked to is that the MOSFET is
on the ground side of the motor.  This makes it easy to drive the
MOSFET, and works fine if you have an isolated motor that has two
separate wires coming out of it.  But if your motor is grounded to the
body of the car, it may be hard to get the MOSFET into the ground wire.
If I remember right, on my '64, there is a short ground wire from the
motor to the body that might be a good place for the MOSFET, _if_ the
motor windings are otherwise isolated from ground.  I don't know if all
Bus wiper motors, especially the later ones, are like this.

It's difficult to fix this problem by simply moving the MOSFET to the
positive side of the motor.  The MOSFET will work that way, but then the
gate voltage has to go a little bit _higher_ than the drain voltage - in
other words, you have to come up with something more than what you get
from the vehicle battery.  You could stick an AA battery in the gate
line, or use a little DC-DC converter to generate a higher voltage to
drive the gate.  Google up &quot;high-side driver&quot; for some chips that are
made to drive MOSFETs like this.

Also, depending on what switching frequency you run, you might put some
noise into your radio if you have one.  It'll be worse on AM, but it
might show up on FM.
