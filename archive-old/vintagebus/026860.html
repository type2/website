The vw is redlined at 5000 rpm for sustained use. Calc your
speed at that rpm and you have your top end speed. I think
it will surprise you. (you may not want to go that fast;
brakes, handling, etc.)

BERG sells rev limiters that kick in around 5800 rpm for the
T2. I do not think BERG would sell a product that would let
you over rev your engine, do you?

I really don't care if you believe it or not, but it is
true. You can not drive a stock vw in 4th gear beyond the
safe rpm limit.

&gt; Ive seen this WOT thing expounded a number of times as if it was found on
&gt; some secret tablet chisled by ferdinand himself. I wont buy it until    I
&gt; see the tablet in person.
