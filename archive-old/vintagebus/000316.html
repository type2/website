The 17th Annual L.A. Porsche and Vintage VW Literature, Model and Memorabilia 
 Model meet will be held again at the Los Angeles Airport Hilton.  The hotel 
is located close to the Los Angeles International Airport.  The event will be 
held in the same space as last year, the Plaza Ballrooms, one level down from 
the main lobby.  We are moving back one weekend from our usual weekend due to 
a scheduling conflict with the hotel.  Our date for this year will be Saturday
, JANUARY 29, 2000.

Last year we had over 200 vendor tables, selling out all available tables.  
Over 500 people attended the meet.

There will be a vender table charge of $35 (must be received by Wayne 
Callaway in Ontario, CA before January 21st) and $50 at the door.  The hall 
will be open for set-up and vendor buying, selling, and swapping at 7:30 a.m. 
 Non-venders will be able to enter the hall after 9:00 a.m. and will be 
charged $5 per person at the door.  &quot;Early-bird&quot; shoppers will be admitted 
with the vendors at 7:30 a.m. for $25 per person at the door.  The meet will 
end at 2:00 p.m.  The entire hall will be nonsmoking.

The Los Angeles Airport Hilton is located at 5711 West Century Blvd., Los 
Angeles, and the phone number is (310)410-4000.    Be certain to ask for the 
special &quot;Porsche/VW Meet&quot; rates when you make your reservations ($99 per 
night single or double regular room, and $129 per night single or double in 
Tower room).  The hotel is located close to the Los Angeles International 
Airport and it runs 24-hours-a day shuttle buses to the airport.

Registrations are being handled by Wayne Callaway.  Confirmations will be 
sent to all the registrants for registrations received by Wayne Callaway in 
Ontario, CA by January 14th.  Thereafter, we'll call you.

The 356 Registry is having a Porsche cars and Porsche parts swap meet on 
Sunday, January 30th at Dunkel Brothers, 1515 East Katella, Anaheim (near 
Anaheim Stadium, exit at Katella off either the 5 or off 57), same as last 
year.  Porsche only, all models, don't miss this event!  There will be a 
Porsche-only parking display area this year.  For more information call Bob 
Campbell at (661)251-3500 or email him at Bob_at_356products_dot_com.

There will be our usual Hospitality Suite with registration and credentials 
on Friday night, so try to get in early if you can.  If you have any 
questions, please contact us.
