I hope that everyone who sold a vehicle (or more) on
his site, as a courtesy, forks over at LEAST a thank
you once you have done the deal. Some courtesy of
minimumal thank you should apply *especially* if you
have inventory which languishes forever on the site. 
(as did one of mine).

I find it unwise to publically discuss the amount of
traffic for what should be obvious business reasons 
relating to our relatives in specific locations. Take
the hint. Other thoughts truncated due to public
forum- but think about it and choose words carefully
when replying...

Thanks Everett for having the VW web site which most
effectively addresses ownership exchange of vehicles
within this target market.
Once again it's not the cost of what it takes to
physically produce and maintain the web site it's the
value of it's service.

I know that many of you have taken the step of
-thanking- the webmaster. Congrats for being a class
act. Of you who have not clued in- please word up and
give a tip of the hat for the service. It is strictly
only my opinion but I have found Ev to be too much of
a gentleman to even breath word one about this point.

Everett is just one more vendor who provides a valid
service for the VW community. Thank you Mr. Barnes for
your FREE service!

Equal thanks to Thom and the many, many others who
provide valuable information, dialog interchange
and/or related products and services. Support those
who support you!
Just my honest opinion
(Privately think about it)
