Subject: Re: [VB] No Power

Have you done the 'obvious' like a compression check, checked
for vacuum leaks, spark, etc?  Maybe you should use a 009 
distributor instead of a 'dissy' ? :)  What kind of boost are
you running?

&gt; Engine above in my 65.  Motor has less that 3,000 miles on it and was built with 7.5/1 compression ratio.  Seems to have little power, struggles to maintain 45 MPH up a moderate/light gradual hill.  That is actually worse than before I rebuilt it.  What is going wrong here?  Is this just the result of the compression ratio it was built with?
