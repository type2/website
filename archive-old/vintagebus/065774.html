&gt;Trend of the year? Pffft please...
&gt;How about a 50 cal that macs an 18&quot; target at 60 meters! Comes complete 
&gt;with an
&gt;electrically operated folding ragtop roof section. Forget getting that CCW
&gt;permit and just pack heavy on the daily commute.

YaaHooo!!!  I'd love to have that thing in LA traffic.  Wouldn't even have 
to be loaded.  Just the sight of it coming up through the roof, and taking 
aim should be enough to clear a path and at the same time, verifying the 
bowel functions of anyone in your way.

Towards the end of the video, there is an camera angle directly into the 
barrel.  Damn near jumped out of my seat when it fired.

Hmmm...  I guess the bottom line is never mess with a ragtop SUV with 
smoked out rear window.  You never know what will pop out.

Now I'm trying to figure out if I could hook that up in the rear of my 
DC.  It should make a platform about the right height.  &quot;What do you mean I 
didn't get best of show?, where are those judges!&quot; :-)

Oh well....

back to work
