&gt; As to the original distributors, your Bentley and other manuals ought to

My engine year is 2001.  It's an AS-41 1600DP with a Brazilian 34 PICT-3 and a 009.
I'm guessing this is a pretty common combination.

&gt; The research is your job and the swap meet
&gt; parts can be a gold mine.

I've been to swapmeets, and I've been on the list, (as recently as
right now) but I still don't know what distributor to use or where
I could get one.
