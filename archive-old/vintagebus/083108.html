Subject: Wipers Again

You got me there Harry. Last time in rain was from Black Rock Campground to
the OCTO show in Long Beach last June. Thats why we live in paradise. Don't
worry about your wipers if you are coming to BBBX, it never rains in Arizona,
as the song goes. But the 6volt wipers do seem to run OK on 12 volts for the
short times I have had to  use them, up to an hour. If it keeps raining longer
than that  pull into the nearest pub for a Hefeweizen ( with lemon) and wait
it out. Still bring the RainX just in case. Oh yeah, I only see the snow in
Seligman in the winter. You'll all be invited there for a weekend bus campout
this  spring  when I can figure out a weekend with no VW shows, any
suggestions on a date? Have 10 acres so can fit alot of buses. See you all at
BBX in Jan. Vwhoward
