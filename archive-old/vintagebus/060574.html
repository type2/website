&gt; My question is the smoke form the huge amount of marvel in those cyls?
&gt; About how long should I expect this to burn off in? The smoke is not in any 
&gt; way blue or black, looks like a watercooled burning up antifreeze almost, 
&gt; but less dense white.

HiAL,
If it is white then it is water.  Let it warm up completely (10-15 minutes 
when only idling.) and see if it goes away.
