Subject: Bastard motor 40HP

Hi folks, I am looking to find-buy-fabricate...the
small screens-plate-whatever covers the small breather
hole under neath the intake ports on the bastard
motored 40hp heads.  I am sure the bastard owners know
what I mean.  Mine are missing and have never seen
what it is supposed to have there.

Would like to buy a set or even just see some detailed
pics so I know what I need to make or look for.

Thanks
Todd
