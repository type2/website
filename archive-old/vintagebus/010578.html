Howdy all.
 For all you folks who are going to the EVERYBUS camp out, and would like to
get a shirt, here's the scoop-
The design is being cleaned up by the printers now, and I am planning to place
the order around the end of the month, to make sure to have them in time. If
you know you want a shirt, and can order it now, that would be great, but
please send the orders in as soon as possible. Don't necessarily count on
getting one there, because I will be paying for these all up front, and won't
be able to afford a whole lot of extras. Since the design will be so fantastic,
of course those extras will be snapped up in a flash, so don't be disappointed,
and order now!
:)
IMPORTANT SIZE NOTE- I will only have XL shirts available at the event, so if
you want a different size, definitely make sure to pre-order.
also, I can get XXL for an extra $2.00, and am still trying to find out about
XXXL and larger sizes.

So, please send a check for $15.00 per shirt to
Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832
als, please send a card with your name,number of shirts, and SIZE as well...
Anyway, It looks like this will be great! here's the website if you haven't
seen it already...
