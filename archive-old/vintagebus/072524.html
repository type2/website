Subject: alabama title?

So i need to get a title for my bus. The title I got
with it was run through the wash, and the DMV won't
take it. In Maryland, only the actual title holder can
apply for a replacement, and he's long gone, so I'm a
bit screwed. I had heard about a deal where a company
in Alabama (where they don't issue titles before 1975)
will &quot;buy&quot; your car, and &quot;sell&quot; it back to you for
about $100, and then you could get a title with the
bill of sale. Google has turned up nothing, and the
entry I found in the vintagebus archives is just a
dead link. Anybody know anything about such a company?
Thanks,
-russ
