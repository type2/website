Subject: Suspension problems or is it tires?

I know you've all had it up to your rockers with my suspension sob story,
but here's something I'm chewing on:

Recently, I selected two good rims, and took them to town to get new tires
put on for the rear.  The only place in town with my size had only two
choices:  Cheaper, and a little more for not as cheap M+S in a brand I'd
never heard of.  So I asked the guy about them, and he assured me that they
were sufficient for 4x4's, Volvos, VW buses.....

Hankook &quot;Zovak&quot; 195 75R14 (HPW401)

I didn't have him put the wheels on, since I wanted to change fronts to
other bus, and rears to front, new ones to rear...

Silly me...they have but a single ply sidewall....

I noticed yesterday that they looked low, so I pumped them up another 12 lbs
to their max pressure of 44 lbs/sq. inch.

Just took a little test drive...problem still there.

Could it be these cheesy tires?

I am going to take the four matched wheels of my '61 (15&quot; rims) and give
them a try.  If it helps, then I'll use the 15's for this trip.  Slower up
hills, maybe, but hey, better gas mileage, right?

Alignment tomorrow...I'll know what's up for sure then!

This is SO fun!
