The napkin was the exact size and color as the original, and both the sketch
and the signature looked authentic...it was the Empi logo that gave it away
as a repro.  VOA lawyers have contacted Empi about the unauthorized
reproduction and the use of the name &quot;Ben&quot; which VOA has trademarked.

&gt; &gt; Does it have the original napkin he used to draw the T1a concept on? If
&gt; &gt; so, I'm good for $600 even!


&gt; Sadly, the napkin is a repro .
