Subject: RE: Broken door lock

Hi Dylan,
I'm not the &quot;local expert&quot; but I've had some experience with door locks. I
assume your problem is with
the 60 single cab you list under your name on your post?
First you may want to read section A-14 in your 1963-1967 Bentley. It's got
good scoop.
My understanding is that common to door, cargo door, and rear hatch locks is
that they all have a tiny set screw
(usually covered with a dab of sealer and years of crud) which can be removed
so the core of the lock comes out and can be changed. Ignition switches don't
have that option. Door were changed to match the ignition not the otherway
around.
I learned this when I had the doors and rear hatch rekeyed on my 63 bus so I
could return to the single key set up it had
when new. After removing all the locks from the bus (by the way I didn't
attempt to remove the lock cylinder from the drivers side handle) I went to
the local professional lock smith in my town (Oak Harbor, WA) and he had them
all &quot;good to go&quot; in about an hour.
Don't know where you &quot;hang your hat&quot; but if it's in or near Seattle, or any
other reasonably sized town you should be able to get
the expertise you need to fix that guy. IMHO.
Good Luck,
Mike Turner
