Well If they can figure out how to get mine started with all the damn toggle
switches I have hooked up on the dash , along with push buttons. And you
still need the key to unlock the steering wheel :) I guess they can have it

I prefer an ignitor set in the fuel tank at the vapor line and hooked to the

Now if you had an alarm that sounded like the vocalizations of a cat
being slowly parbroiled...
