Rex,
it was showing off to those &quot;little girls on roller skates&quot; that your wife could

Big S*** Eating Grin = BIG Trouble Brewing when you get home buster.
Polite Texas Nod = No Storm on the Horizon, you'll live to see another day.

Since you were still alive to pen the above note, I'm assuming it was somewhere
