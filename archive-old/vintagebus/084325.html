Subject: Re: [VB] Born on Date 08/05/1955...

What I wouldnt give to find a type 34 or notch built on my birthday,
09/01/64... or possibly a nice bus.

I want to find my wife a deluxe or other suitable 'girl' bus (read
non-panel) that was built on her birthday, Nov. 19, 1957.

Generous finders fee paid to anyone with some leads.

&gt; The one millionth beetle was produced on this date. 50 Years ago today.
