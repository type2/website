Listees,

Are you planning your year at the shows?

Don't forget Busses and Balloons here in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

&quot;Busses and Balloons&quot; is a campout and Volkswagen car show put on
by Route 66 Splits and Neato in Albuquerque, New Mexico each year
during the International Balloon Fiesta.  This year, it will be 
held on October 6th and 7th, 2000.  Our site, three miles from 
the Balloon Fiesta grounds, affords a great view of the balloons 
during the mass ascensions Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Almost 
one thousand hot air balloons rise from the ground early each morning. 

The VW only car show takes place Saturday the 7th from 10 to 3 at 
7201 Paseo Del Norte, NE just behind the New Covenant Church.  There 
are raffles and a trophy presentation during the show.  Swap spaces 
are available.

Camping is $10 for both nights and the car show entry is $10.

General admission is two cans of food or one dollar to benefit the 
Roadrunner Food Bank.

For further information, call JP at 505-247-1177 or e-mail 
jphenrikse_at_aol_dot_com or call Foreign Aide at 800-658-5712.

The rules for camping include no dogs, and no on-ground campfires.  
BBQ's OK.

We hope to see you in October!
