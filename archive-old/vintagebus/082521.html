Subject: RE: [VB] Hot showers at bus campouts ?

&gt;Do most of the type 2 camp outs that you attend have
&gt;hot showers ? and does not having one have any bearing
&gt;on if you attend that event or not?
&gt;
I'm not really inflluenced by the availability of hot showers. A few years 
back I invested in one of those solar shower bags- basicly just a black 
rubber bladder that heats water through solar inslolation then you hang it 
up above you and open up the valve. Voila! A lukewarm shower leaving you 
with a slight aroma of warm rubber!
