Please visit the west coast bus if it is anyone's intent to purchase and
have shipped, esp with the cheap airfare now. I recieved promises glaore,
the pics looked ok for OG paint, and got a mechanical nightmare (the list of
DPO atrocities is too long to list here, but my website is almost ready). I
have spent 6 months and about 5.5K getting the bus just mechanically where I
wanted it. This was a bus from OR. Overall, and now that the iniail fuming
is over, I am happy with her, but could have gone farther with the money
already spent my being more careful.
 East coast buses (where I am), are often bondo mobiles or in need of lots o
panels, which was the one aspect where I was lucky, as mine has three small
dents and needs new paint to shine (although i am trying the compound route
for giggles first)
Good luck in your search!

There's a lot to be said for shipping a ready-to-drive bus out from the
left coast versus restoring a local one yourself.  Gets most of the cost
out of the way up front, bank can finance it all, no lengthy restoration
to pay for out of pocket, no worry about when and whether you'll ever
get it done.  Plan to pay around $1000 for auto shipping coast to
coast.  Driving it home is cheaper but riskier unless you have
rock-solid assurances from the PO that maintenance is up-to-date for the
engine, tranny, RGBs, suspension, brakes, fuel system, and so on.

On the other hand, restoring a local bus gives you the satisfaction of
returning another classic VW to the road in better shape than you found
it.  Another good spot for online auto ads is www.traderonline_dot_com,
under the classic auto section.  Their large database is searchable by
region, make and model, and years.

Just my opinion, of course.

&gt; &quot;fly in drive out&quot; deal) from a rust free area, but I think I'm gonna
&gt; see what I can turn up locally first. Hmmm.... There is that 67 SC
&gt; for sale up in NH on thesamba_dot_com, but rust in the treasure chest
&gt; kinda scares me.
