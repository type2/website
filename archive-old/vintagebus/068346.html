Subject: Re: [VB] Apparently Nice Single Cab FS

&gt;Sure looks allot like the Jerome raffle bus from 2002.  It was a 66 and
double treasure chest too.  Just can't tell from the pics if it is a Double
door treasure chest or not
&gt;
The Jerome Single Cab is owned by Keith in Phoenix.  It is White, that Single
Cab looks like grey primer to me, although the pictures are blurry.

All Single Cabs have dual treasure chest doors standard starting in late
'63 (corrections?).

Buy!
