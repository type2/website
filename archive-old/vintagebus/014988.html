Hi all. I just came back from NE last night with my new bus in tow. I got
some pictures on my web-site already and will be getting more later.
Address is: http://www.inter-kiosk_dot_com/VW-Bus/     and go from there on. 
I'll have a ton of questions since this is only my second bus and I did
nothing with the first one. This one drives and it was only $1,000.00.
It's a bit weird though. I know now that it was a panel at one time
converted by some visionary pseudo mechanic to camper. Windows were cut
out using sawz-all I bet and in the back panel is cut-open to the engine
compartment. I mean really nasty job. Woodwork is not too nice as well.
I'll start with the questions next. Thanks all for all your feedback.
