 No problem at all. I know what you mean by &quot;crunchy&quot;,
quite a few years ago i had a mohawk and now i think
school uniforms are a great idea!
Time does strange things to oneself..

&gt; You are correct, sorry I did make it clear that

&gt; 
&gt; I definitely agree with your last sentence there.  I
&gt; try to avoid China
&gt; products, but all in all they may be better than
&gt; other countries on human
&gt; rights than others that are &quot;below the radar&quot;
&gt; because of low production of
&gt; US import goods.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I mean no disrespect to your original post,
&gt; which is sometimes hard to
&gt; discern on a e-mail BBS list.  Notice how many flame
&gt; chains have come up
&gt; again and again.
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to say it but the older I get the more
&gt; &quot;crunchy&quot; I am becoming... I
&gt; thought it was the other way around.  Then again
&gt; after meeting a few list
&gt; guys this weekend at the Sevierville TN show (small)
&gt; they were amazed to see
&gt; me from what they &quot;thought&quot; I might be from just
&gt; list interactions.  Not
&gt; sure if that was good or bad?
&gt; 
&gt; Take Care,
&gt; Adrian

&gt; I know this is a bus list and i don't want to split
&gt; hairs but, China is not part of NATO.
&gt; (http://www.nato.int/structur/countries.htm) It's
&gt; the
&gt; United Nations that is conducting this action.
&gt;  I do support the ideal that you are standing
&gt; behind.
&gt; It is a hard one to do considering the number of
&gt; items
&gt; that are made in other countries that are not
&gt; supporters of free thinking and basic human rights.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz, CA (831.426.1244)has

&gt; &gt; Wood slat roof racks
&gt; &gt; (made in China) at a real good price.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not saying this is a good or bad product... 
&gt; &gt; But &quot;made in China&quot; does
&gt; &gt; not get my $ vote.  Remember they are still a
&gt; &gt; communist country.  Or have we
&gt; &gt; all forgotten about Tienamin Square and the recent
&gt; &gt; plane events.  Also I
&gt; &gt; have not seen China helping NATO in this time of
&gt; &gt; need, maybe they are on the
&gt; &gt; other side?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think it is worth a few more bucks to get a
&gt; &quot;made
&gt; &gt; in the USA&quot; label on my
&gt; &gt; products...  Or at least not in China!  And
&gt; &gt; sometimes you, as a buyer, have
&gt; &gt; no option but to get &quot;made in China&quot; which is sad.
