Subject: Love Bug campout lives? (O'Leno FL US July 28-30)

Hi gang:

I just made a reservation for one site, two nights at O'Leno State Park
near High Springs
(http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/District_2/oleno/index.html).  I plan
to arrive Friday night, July 28 and stay through Sunday.  Hoping to tube
the Ichetucknee on Saturday or maybe Sunday.

If you haven't been, O'Leno is on the Santa Fe and has a swimming area
in the park; I've stayed there in summer and it's not unbearable if you
spend a lot of time in the water. :-)  (Don't tell Charlie Ford, but I
plan to bring a portable AC unit just in case.)

In fact, last trip it rained a lot -- even so, very pleasant.  The park
is very handy to Ichetucknee and Ginnie Springs, and there's canoeing on
the Santa Fe outside the park at River Rise; High Springs has decent
eats.  The park is not far off I-75 about 30 minutes NE of Gainesville.

The guy at the park office ((904)454-1853) says there are plenty of
sites left.  They have two camping areas so you might need to ask
explicitly if you want a site near us.

Y'all come!  Pass the word along.
Joe Clark
