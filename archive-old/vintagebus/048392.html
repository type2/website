&lt;&lt; Anyone have any tips on excessive freeplay in the steering wheel?&gt;&gt;
Yes, inspect and fix!

&lt;&lt; There is so much slack when I turn the wheel, that steering has become
 more like &quot;tacking&quot; as in a sailboat.&gt;&gt;
Not good!

 &lt;&lt;Does this indicate problems in the steering box? Or, would the culprit
 be tie-rod ends? &gt;&gt;
Yes, yes, and yes.  Have a friend sit in the drivers seat and wiggle the
steering wheel in the slop area with the tires pointing straight forward.
Meanwhile you slide under the front of the bus and look to see if the center
pin, tie rods, steering box, pitman arm, drag link, king pins, link pins are
loose and/or need replacing.  This should be checked every 6,000 - 9,000
miles when you refill your steering box.  Also check that the number of turns
left are equal to the number of turns right from straight.
