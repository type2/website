Subject: Engine comparment color on panel?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What color would the engine comparment be on a panel that was delivered  
blank  ready to be painted by the company in their color ?

Was the whole bus primered in grey first and then painted ?

Just wondering if I need to paint the engine comparment grey or the body 
color on a company panel.....

thanks for any help......
