If, by &quot;main bulbs&quot;, you mean the headlights, please know that that's
illegal in most places that I know of.  It's considered a safety
hazard for you to lose your road-lighting ability even momentarily.

As for the front running lights, or any combination of the filaments
in appropriate rear bulbs, pretty much anything goes.
