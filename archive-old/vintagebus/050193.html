Subject: Flea Market book

Scored a 1971-1974 Without Guesswork VW service manual for Types 1,2,3,and4
at a Flea Market this weekend. It's in good condition with some light
stains towards the tops of the pages. I'm not terribly attatched to it.
I'll probably scan the info for myself and then sell it on eBay. If someone
wants it before that, let me know. I'd probably be happier selling it to
the highest bidder from the list. I know it's not made of gold or anything,
just thought I'd try to pass it along to some of you folks that collect
this kind of stuff. I'm just happy getting the info. out of it :)
