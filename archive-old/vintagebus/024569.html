&gt; as well just do the whole thing and have it done with. Oh and I would at
&gt; least go with 87mm pistons instead of 85.5s they bolt right in and
&gt; increase power, especially in a bus. Good luck and keep us informed.

Bad Idea!
The 87mm slip-in p's and c's are really thin walled, and with any sort
of prolonged highway driving are prone to warping and disfiguring,
meaning an engine that wears out A LOT faster. They are great for the
dunes, and in a dragster, but the thin-walled slip-ins are not good for
a road engine.
Same with the 92mm, instead of the 90.5's.  Both have same outer
diameter, but the extra 1.5 mm inner diameter means thin walls.

I would go stock, but if you are gonna go big, ( and stay with stock 69
mm stroke) go for the 90.5's that make a 1776cc on a case with head
studs. That way you are not getting close to the stud locations when you
have the bores in the case cut bigger. Then  I would go singleport
intake, keeping a nice torque-y engine, better for the bus. 

Then again, if you have the bread, why not stroke that baby, and stay
with a decent sized bore? It's only money.
