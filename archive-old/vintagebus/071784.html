Subject: Re: [VB] 'go fast' crash box

Ya, ya, whatever your math says.   feel free to visit we'll go for a drive.  
It even has a tach these days.   It really shocked Eric of VeeWee111 when he 
convinced me to temp'ly hook up his tach (some years ago), as he was sure I 
was overrevving it, as I said 58 was that bus' sweet spot.  well 58 was 3K by 
his tach

oh, and it has a .82 4th gear, not a .89 4th.

 &gt; with the early 64 gearing in my 61 (4.38 r&amp;p, big nut 1.26 boxes and 15&quot;  
rims
 &gt; 205 75 15 tires) I get 3K in 4th at 58 mph, and 3500rpms gives 68mph.  It 
has
 &gt; plenty oomph to pull hills and get to speed with a 1600.
 &gt;
 
 Assuming a stock .89 4th, that would actually put you at 48mph at 3000rpm,
 56mph at 3500, and 64mph at 4000rpm.
 
 Even with a .82 4th you would still be at 52mph at 3000rpm, 60.5mph at 3500,
 and 69mph at 4000rpm.
