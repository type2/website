The first thing I would do is check the wires (ala Clara) but the biggest
problem I have heard you mention is your trying to set things with 3 fouled
plugs. VW's in my experience DO NOT like fouled plugs. I have had many a
cars come through the shop with the symptoms you described, with the owners
having changed everything but the plugs, the answer was I just put plugs in
a few hundred miles ago, I answered by saying &quot;Here's the deal, I'll install
new plugs, if it doesn't help you can have them for free&quot;, I always got
paid!

valves dont seem badly out.   the compression seems on the low side, but not

horrible.  But really, all 4 spark plugs should look the same   #1 is not 
burning the same as the other three.  this could be a bad plug wire, needing

new plugs, or something in the motor. if you start it up, then with a rag 
pull one spark plug wire off the dist cap, then replace it , how does the 
sound differ?  check all 4.  pulling each plug should changg the way the 
motor runs exactly the same, no favorites or bad guys.  If 3 make bigger 
changes, and one very little or none, it is probably #1.  And as the 
compression in # is not 25psi or something dramatically lower than the 
others, I would check the spark plug wires.  they should be flexible, and
not 
have cracks, etc.

&lt;&lt; Today checked the valve settings. All but three were .006. The others

 .008
 Thats good! ?
 Compression was 105 110 105 110
 Sounds good.
 All plugs but #1 looked &quot;black&quot; .
 
 Any input?

 Subject: Everybus/ What did I do to the engine?
 
 
 &gt; Just as I pulled into Everybus, I noted that there was a little more
smoke
 &gt; that normal, but have a leaky oil cooler, so was not concerned. Spent the
 &gt; weekend socializing and losing the chili cookoff, and losing the best
 &gt; campsite prize. :-)
 &gt;
 &gt; Topped off the oil, lost about ¼ quart on the trip down. Sunday as I
 pulled
 &gt; out all started ok, no worries.
 &gt;
 &gt; Got gas at about 10 miles and had a little start problem. Humm???
 &gt;
 &gt; 30 more miles and started noticing a loss of power. Looked at the trees.
 Not
 &gt; that much head wind. Then &quot;the smell&quot; hit me. Hot and pulled over. Ouch,
 &gt; VERY VERY HOT. Dumping a fair amount of oil.
...
 &gt; My question: What did I do to this engine? Got really hot. Jamie shot his
 &gt; thermometer at it and was 240 on the case and 350 on the heads, but that
 was
 &gt; after cooling down and 10 miles of flatland going 40 to 45mph. My plan is
 to
 &gt; check the valve clearances, then compression, then jank it to put Urge's
 (71
 &gt; bus) engine in. What would you do?
 &gt;
 &gt; After cooling down, I estimate the engine was running on about 75% of
 normal
 &gt; power. Hills I take at 38 in third were struggling at 30 or going to
 second
 &gt; gear.
