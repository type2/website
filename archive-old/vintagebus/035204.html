Subject: RE: [VB] Carb woes / flat spot and over heating continued

&quot;Symptom: dreadfully bad flat spot at low rpm. I thought was due to 009 but
as bad if not worse with vac advance dizzy. Rebuilt carb made it worse yet
and today at idle, parked, when I stomp the gas is the thing nearly dies. I
have to pump the petal to keep it running. Is fine at higher rpm. Ran great
in this 60 degree weather going down hill! :-(&quot;

Sounds like timing or points to me.  Check your points gap, then reset your
timing.   I set my timing at 32 degrees over 3500 RPM, vacuum dizzy...
Might tune it back to 30 if you do not have a temp gauge to be safe.

Did you blow out your carb with an air compressor after soaking it in carb
cleaner?  I had a carb that was caked with mud inside and desperately needed
blown out, sometimes the passages can be all gummed up.  

As long as the carb is tuned to baseline it should at least start and idle a
little bit.  I think 3 turns out for volume and 4-5 turns out for
air-bypass...  Or vice-versa?

Good Luck,
