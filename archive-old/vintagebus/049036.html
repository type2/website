Spring can't be too far off.  It's time to clean house and garage.  I've
saved
three Type 2's from the crusher and I'm looking for good homes for
them.

#1) 1966 Deluxe Sunroof Bench Seat.  It's been pretty well picked
over,
but is salvageable as a project 21-window bus.  Right reduction gear
and tranny problems.  Clear, IL title.

#2) 1967 Walk-Thru Westy.  It, too, has been picked over.  Florida
title, signed.

#3) 1969 Bay Window &quot;Clipper&quot; Deluxe.  I don't know much about it
execpt 
it sat as &quot;storage shed&quot; for 15 years or so.  No title.

No, I'm not looking to sell parts or cut them up myself.

None of these have engines in them, though most of the doors, 
hatches and glass are there.  It'd take a trailer to transport them.
I'll take $100 for each....or I'll put them on ebay as RARE, bids
starting at $10,000!
