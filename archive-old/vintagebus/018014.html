 My 18 year kid wants me to keep it so he can
&gt; inherit it but he won’t
&gt; give it the care it deserves so
&gt; here it is on ebay for sale. That’s the story.

Sounds to me like this guy should take his 18 year
kid, get in the bus with him, and drive across the
country.

He'd get more value added to his life than $12000
could ever get him.

67 deluxe, on it's way to a nice resto, gonna have
some fun in it.
