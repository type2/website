&lt;&lt; I would like to have some. Is there any type of tent or more or less 
awning that does not require holes or brackets in the roof of my bus? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
We use a Sundial tent on our 1960 WT camper conversion panel.  Since we have 
a pair of 1/3 German roof rack on the bus we are able to just bungee the bus 
side of the tent poles to the racks with no problems.  Dawn _at_ PLF borrowed 
this tent from us to make repros so you could talk to here or make one 
yourself.  The poles are just made out of electrical conduit tubing.  Easy to 
cut, bend with the proper hardware store handtool and assemble with conduit 
couplers.  Eric&amp;Barb
