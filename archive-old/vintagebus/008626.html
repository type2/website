In the January 2001 issue of &quot;Fast Company&quot; on page 102 &amp; 103 of the
Peoplepalooza article, there's a nice retro illustration by Bruce McCall
that depicts an orange and white splitty and a Citroen cruising into town,
in the oncoming lane there appears to be a Porsche 356 Spyder. There's also
a bridge scene with a black oval-window beetle crossing a gorge.
Very cool illustration.
