I have the origionals in my motor, and I used the scat
piece on a customer's motor and I was surprised how
nice they fit, fits a bit better than the origionals.

&gt; Does anyone have any original type 3 &quot;cool tin&quot;
&gt; they'd like to sell?  I
&gt; know there's aftermarket pieces, and they're junk. 
&gt; I'd like to put these
&gt; on my engine too - my off-road friends swear by it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
