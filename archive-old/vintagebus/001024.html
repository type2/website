Hey,

You didn't sign your email, so &quot;Hey&quot; was the best that I could do.

Although 3,000 would seem like a reasonable price in an area with no other
options, it seems on the high side to me.  I guess it all depends on what
you are looking for, and what your timeframe is.  It is always about the
timeframe.  Since you are submitting to the vintage bus list, I'll put in my
&quot;Hold out for an older one..&quot; bit.  Later models definitly have their place,
but I say you should stick with a split window.  With a late model you will
have to deal with plastic parts(namely the dash), that will crack over time.
Replacing them, although not entirely difficult, seems like a big PITA.
There also seems to be something different about splits.  A bit more style,
and the key:  Simplicity.

You will be the best judge, but for $3000, the bus should be VERY clean.
Like NO or very little rust.  For that price, it should have a very
presentable paintjob, and the PO should have all of the receipts for the
investment they have.  Is the $4200 over the entire course of them owning
the vehicle?  Are they including all of the maintinence, and tires they have
put on the vehicle?

They can only justify tires if they have JUST put them on the vehicle, and
there is very little miles on them.  Are they counting every tune upe in the
past five years?

Bottom line, is not what they have invested in the car.  Maybe they paid too
much for the car to begin with, and have paid too much for all of the
maintenence.  Take a good crooked look at the car, and then take a good look
at one of the vw rags out there.  Then think what you want to have at the
end of your project.  If this vehicle fits in that picture, you have already
made your decision. - K

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't have a bus yet, but I'm looking at one, and was hoping
&gt; that someone on this list would be able to help me.  The bus is a
&gt; 1974, with a new engine and clutch.  The owners put in $4,200 for
&gt; the bus and are asking $3,000 or best offer for it.  Is this a
&gt; good deal or not?? Any help or comments would be gratefully appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.
