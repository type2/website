I bought an NOS one on ebay to put in my panel and I have the *exact* same
problem!  I drive around with the cable pulled out; if I run out of gas, I
push it in...

&gt;I've got a question, is the fuel petcock different on a single cab then a
&gt;regular bus?? these would be the one with the reserve lever on them. I have
&gt;a bunch of new (not NOS) fuel petcocks and when I went to install one on my
&gt;side loader the lever would be in the wrong position. The cable would have
&gt;to be pulled out for the on position and pushed in for the reserve. I have
&gt;installed these on buses without a problem and checked all the OG ones I
&gt;have and they were all the same. None of my other single cabs have these on
&gt;them (all replaced by PO's), so I have nothing to compare to.
