&gt; I just want to give congrats to the newest 1950 panel bus owner ( vin 7869,
&gt;I think). It only took 10 years, but you got it. How did all you So Cal guys
&gt;miss this one ( kind of a rub in) ? Pays  to keep going back. Hope Ronnie
&gt;won&quot;t spill the beans and name the new owner, as he wants to DRIVE it to
&gt;Kelly Park this year.
&gt; See you all at the Red Barn Sat.
&gt;
&gt; John ( not the new owner, but wish I was ) Howard, and hope Ronnie keeps
