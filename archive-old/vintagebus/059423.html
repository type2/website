Subject: Re: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

you could take your bus over to Westfalia and they would put an interior in 
it.....(probably even today )

So there are going to be some Westys that are made out of other models......

these would probably not have an M code to show it went to Westfalia, but 
would be a true Westy......

nothing is 100% when it  comes to Germany and old buses !.........
