Subject: one 16&quot; powdercoated bus rim up for grabs
Date: Mon, 7 Dec 1998 22:35:35 -0600

I've got a set of 5 bus rims that are powercoated white but unfortuately, in
my rush to get them done, I failed to notice that one is larger than the
others.  I'm willing to trade this 16&quot; powdercoated rim for a good used (all
hubcap clips intact) 15&quot; rim that I can sandblast and have powercoated.
This is for my 1966 bus project &amp; I failed to mention that I'm not sure if
my rim has all the clips on it or not.  For anyone that replies, I'll double
check.  Thanks.
