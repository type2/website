Hey Now!!

   I took out the tranny on my 64(large nut) and was gonna have it the
full tilt rebuild.  I got it out ok with only minor problems.  I've
cleaned up the case and I want to take off the brakes, Redux, and axle
tubes.  So, step one is: Get the axle nut off!  This weekend I put it
through hell and it still came out on top and unmoved!  First I got my
heat gun\tourch out.  I soaked it in Liquid Wrench and took a huge cheeter
bar to it(5ft).  It didn't move.  So I got out the electric impact 400ft
tourqe.  Still nothing.  Then I took it down to AA Rentals and
they let me go to town with all the heavy stuff I don't have.  Last but
not least was the 185 CFM air compressor and a 1'' impact!!  The boys said
that could take off anything.  The bell rang and the winner: AND STILL
UNDEFEATED Heavly tourqed champion of the world! My 64 Trans!

What the hey do I do now!(I'm figuring just melting it off here soon.
I'm having my brother take it into his auto dealership shop to see what
damage they can do, but I wouldn't think much more then what I put it
through.  HELP!
