&lt;&lt; Funny how there seems to be at least 5 or so places in the U.K. selling

from what I heard, Westy interiors are VERY hard to find in Europe, while it 
has been relatively easy to find one here... especially bay westy stuff.    
Since you can get that relatively cheap out of a junkyard or someone's garage 
if you want to make your non-camper into a camper, maybe that is why the new 
kits have not caught on as much here.   
The bay westy Z-bed I put in my '61 was free from a junkyard, FWIW.  
Something about it being better for them selling cars to the scrapper without seats in 
them.
