I will probably leave it on the areas behind the door panels.  I will definitely remove it from the engine compartment.  I am not sure what to do about the area behind the back seat where they covered the tar boards and paint.  Probably can't find NOS tar boards, especially NOS, but don't know if I want it covered with tar in a visible place.  Don't have a real problem with bus interiors rusting here in sunny AZ.  I have some kerosene I'll give a try.  Thanks,
Richard

Hi Richard,
Kerosene is good and pretty safe compared to gasoline.  Do you really have to 
remove the tar?  If not leave it or only take off what you have to and 
replace it when done.  This is especially good to have in areas that one does 
not see unless the VW is dissassembled.   Eric&amp;Barb
