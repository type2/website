Subject: Schofield under-nose metal FS or trade...

Got no nibbles the first time around, and the person who originally wanted
it is nowhere to be found, so let's try again:

I have a complete set of Schofield's under-nose-behind-the-bumper metal
that I am not going to need...
I found an entire clip to weld on, from the frame out!

This set of metal consists of 6 bits; for a split-window.

 I paid $140 including shipping... make me an offer, or trade me; I would
gladly swap for some cab floor pans, even ones cut from a bus (as long as
they were in better shape than mine!), interesting manuals (mebbee even
repros), etc. Be creative!!
I would rather these go to use than have them collect dust here.
Next stop is Ofay - I mean ebay...    &quot;NOS 40 hp VW metal - straight from
the factory!!&quot; ;)

The metal is in Austin, TX btw.
