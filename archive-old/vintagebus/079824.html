&gt; I had opportunity this weekend to experience the kindness 
&gt; of the bus community... Knowing I was screwed, I call my wife 
&gt; to get me a list of A.I.R.S. members in the area. Nik and Ruth
&gt; Bajorek showed up in their Sage Green westy.... I had a few
&gt; calls of concern from my Canadian friends... Troy Thrasher
&gt; (another A.I.R.S. member showed up in his '62 Panel... 
&gt; To make a long story short, my bus got fixed even though
&gt; Troy missed time spent with his son, and Nik spent from 8:30 
&gt; AM until 10:30 PM right by my side! 


Wow, that's a heartwarming story! It's stories like this that remind me
why I risked everything I owned to become part of the Bus community on a
full-time basis. Sometimes on a down day, when I've just finished
dealing with an irate customer who reamed me a new a__hole over
something that wasn't even my fault, I wonder what I'm doing here. But
then I see stories like this, or meet similar people myself, and in
their kindness they put it all in perspective. There really is something
about the Bus community as a whole that you just don't find in most
walks of life. Your story made my day.
