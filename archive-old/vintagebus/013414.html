&gt;Our big wind tunnel at work uses a honey comb grid to help provide a
laminar air flow.  It would be cool to see this little home made mini wind
tunnel.  I should start building this sort of thing to use my school skills.

 Bob Hoover gave me some more detail on his home-built  . .

 There were over 1 million hits on the net search . .

 Plenty of data for the clever . . :-)

 I have to say I'm also impressed by how little you need to 
get some relevant data . .

 Reading about home-made strain gages . . . mylar drafting film
with pencil lead on it . . (graphite)

 Same person who wrote about gage said he used his first one
for a model rocket  . . . the wind tunnel was mounted on the
fender of a car . . readout on a digital vom . .

 He didn't say but that was probably the beginning of NASA . . :-)
