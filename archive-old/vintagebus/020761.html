Subject: Digest Problems

Volks,

The digests of both lists are having some break-in problems (the digests 
are being birthed at unpredictable intervals and we're still figuring 
out why).

Yes we know that a type2 digest went out that had only one message in 
it, which was two sentences long, and wasn't worth reading in the first 
place. =^)

It's quite a different list management program we're using now, we're 
still settling in to it, Super-Engineer Raistrick is on the case, please 
bear with us.
