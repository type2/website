Subject: Buses n Boats event update

Howdy Y'all,
Heres the latest update regarding the Fifth Annual VW
Buses 'n Boats Bash just north of Cincinnati, Ohio,
May 20-22.
Being the generous Supervisor that I am, I have
decided to give Frank Biffath the day off from cooking
his giant pot 'o chili on Saturday. He works too hard,
so now he will be forced to RELAX!  We will be doing
something a little different for the Saturday evening
pot luck dinner,  since we are in the Cincinnati area,
we will be having a Cincinnati Style Chili dinner. If
any of you are not from the region and thus unfamiliar
with Cincinnati Style chili, think Gold Star or
Skyline Chili, no beans, and you generally eat it on
hot dogs (cheese coneys) or spaghetti. With the
Cincy-style chili, I can  prepare a huge pot a day in
advance and freeze it, then warm it up on Saturday so
no one has to spend the entire day cooking.  So,
everyone should bring appropriate dishes such as hot
dogs, buns, cheese, pasta, garlic bread, etc...
Of course we will be doing breakfast burritos on
Saturday morning, so bring an ingredient for that as
well.
REGARDING CANOEING:  If you think you will want to
participate in the canoe trip, please tell me ASAP so
I can give the canoe livery folks an idea of how many
will be going.

OK, thats it! Heres the link to the event web site:

I can't wait to camp and I can't wait to show everyone
my latest top-secret vw-related project that I have
been building in my garage...

Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
