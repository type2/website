Yes, generally the superceding part will have exactly the same part number... 
except for the suffix.  Thus the first version will be plain (no suffix) then 
they will have an A version, then B , then C, and you can find parts with J 
suffixs.

 Hi,
 
 Thanks for the responses. I shoulda looked at the pn for the later signals
 too. Is it common for a part that superseded another to inherit most of the
 original's pn? 
 
 &gt; but if you read the search by part number bit in the busdepot 
 &gt; website, it 
 &gt; says enter no suffix letters, just the 9 digit p/n and it 
 &gt; will bring up 
 &gt; everything that fits.   what comes up when you type in that 
 &gt; p/n is the B 
 &gt; version- fried eggs.  listed with the B suffix and it says 
 &gt; used on 62-67.    
 &gt; they do not have the pointy yellow lens listed in the catalog
 &gt;
