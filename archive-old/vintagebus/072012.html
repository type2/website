&gt; Anyone got any ideas

Hi Paul,
You are probably going to be stuck with using a 165SR15 tire which is for a 
type 1 and really not wieght rated for the bus.  In other words you use it as 
a get to the next town and get the flat tire fixed/replaced.  Especially 
since if you use differant sized tires on the rear axle for several thousand 
miles can cause damage to the differential!
