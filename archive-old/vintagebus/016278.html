Does this mean you get to eat free at the restaurants that have a sign
saying &quot;Bus drivers eat free&quot;?

Original message:
Vehicle access to my daughter's High School main entrance is up a long,
steep drive that is permanently posted &quot;Buses Only&quot;.  At dismissal time
an
occupied police cruiser is parked right at the top by the entrance.

For 2 years I've routinely motored up the drive in OUR &quot;bus&quot; to pick up
my
kid, and the cop ALWAYS smiles and waves :)
