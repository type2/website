&gt; &quot;In 100 degree (38 C) heat the Icester produces 65 F. (19 C.) (+-) of Air
&gt; Conditioned comfort out of the powerful blower using cubed or
&gt; block ice. Reusable Freeze Packs will be about 78 F. (25 C) in the 100 F. (38
&gt; C) heat. In general cubed ice is used up quicker than block ice of
&gt; equal weight. The length of time the reusable Freeze Packs perform depends on
&gt; the quantity that are used.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The air will be on the average 10 degrees cooler than the air going in. For
&gt; example if the air in the non air conditioned room is 85
&gt; degrees, the cool dry air will be 75 degrees. You can continue to re-circulate
&gt; the cooled air with the AC110 (no venting of any kind is
&gt; needed) therefore eventually it will begin to cool the ambient air down. In
&gt; the meantime you will have cool dry air blowing directly on you.&quot;

I've no doubt that this thing can produce 65 degree air, but the question
is for how long.  If you're using ice to cool air flowing into your bus,
expect to use a _lot_ of ice.  I can run the numbers if you like, but
suffice to say that you aren't going to put a 10 lb block of ice and have
AC all day from it!
