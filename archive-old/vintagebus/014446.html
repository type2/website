&lt;&lt; Maybe we should think about this from a different angle.  Someone mentioned
 that we should make them without frames at all?  Is this feasible?  I'm not

Hi Rennie,
The big problem with this idea is to do this you would have to use tempered 
glass instead of safety laminated glass.  For side windows tempered works 
just fine, but for windshields which all too often get hit by rocks at 
highway speeds the glass will completely explode into very small pieces and 
blow into the eyes of those inside.  Just about two years ago we had a direct 
hit center passenger window by a rock thrown up by a semi over 300 Yards 
ahead.  The rock just a little smaller than a golf ball almost punctured 
through the laminated glass and a small amount of glass fragments coated the 
front seats!  So unless you plan to issue WWII type of flying goggles, and 
make sure to get written statements that they will wear them to keep the 
glass out of the eye of your customers to CYA yourself from lawsuits, it will 
not work.  Eric&amp;Barb
