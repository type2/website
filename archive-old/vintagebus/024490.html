 Allright - here it is.  My transmission does not come out of third gear.  
When
 I have it in neutral, it is in third gear.  When I put it into any other 
gear,
 the transmission locks up because it is in two gears at the same time.  I've
 worked on other trannies, but never a vw.
 
 What is involved in fixing this?  Anyone have any similar experience? Is the
 problem just in the nosecone with the hockeystick?  I've worked on other
 trannies, but never a vw.  I just want to know what to expect.

it cannot be in two gears at once.  It just can't.   Either your problem is 
in the tranny, or in the linkage.    Is this a bus you had been driving, that 
just started a problem, or a bus that had been sitting?    

First thing is to check the linkage.   leave engine off, how does the stick 
shift feel moving it in gears?   it should have an H pattern, with reverse 
down , and back to the left of 2nd.  Should feel it that it goes into and out 
of each gear.

leave it in neutral and look under the bus.   Belley pan (if any) under the 
pedals off.  See the bottom of the shift stick?  and the front part of the 
shift rod?  and where the front shift rod connects to the rear shift rod?  
every thing tight there, put a hand on the f and r shift rods and try to 
twist, there should be no twist.  now go back to the front end of the tranny, 
where the end of the hockey stick connects to the rear of the rear shift rod 
there is a coupler.    is it good?  have a friend wiggle the shift stick up 
front back and forth.  there shoulf be no play.  If the coupler is bad, 
replace it.  If the screws are loose, tighten them and tie them with wire.  
it is not wierd for a screw to back out or the rear coupler to go bad.

if this doesn't help, it is likely in the tranny somewhere.    BTW, when did 
you last change the gear oil?  Change it, center and RGBoxes, make sure the 
boots are not torn or cracked.   Drain the oil into a clean pan, and do a tea 
leaf reading.

Hope this helps.
