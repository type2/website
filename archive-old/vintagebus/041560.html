&gt; I wasn't asking about the 8.8.  I was asking about the grades which the

&gt; Do you know what these numbers mean?  It's hard to tell which number is
&gt; &quot;higher&quot;, since they seem to be from two different rating systems.

The 18-8 and 316 refer to the grade of stainless that the fastener is made
from, not the strength of the fastener.  If a strength rating isn't given,
then the assumption is that the bolt is of the lowest common strength
grade.

BTW, now all stainless is completely corrosion resistant.  You can also
get some nasty electrochemical effects between stainless and other
materials.

When you start selecting different materials for your vehicle, you've just
become a materials engineer.  Be sure you know what you're doing!
