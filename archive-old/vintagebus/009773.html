Hey Volks...

After reading and pondering the replies to my post &quot;Tranny Woes&quot;, I have
decided that it could very well be a clutch assembly related problem, and
that it would be worth it to try and get a couple thousand more miles out of
this tranny before a rebuild.  So I'm getting the clutch kit, seals for
engine and tranny, and a gland nut today, and if all goes well, we'll know
if it worked by tomorrow night!  I forgot to mention that the clutch
probably has lots of oil on it, given the amount of black sticky goo around
the bell housing, and that it chattered upon release, shifting up or down,
in all gears....

If this doesn't work, well, I needed a new clutch anyway, and as Michele has
mentioned, a fresh tranny makes for a really nice secure feeling!

Thanks for all the info!

Gene
