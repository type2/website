Subject: '54 Single Cab found, must sell '65 Squareback

Ok, last Friday, got &quot;the call,&quot; a guy willing to sell off his '54 Single
Cab I saw at last weekends SOTO meet.  Long story short (more later), he
pulled it out of a local guys yard about a year ago, got it going again,
realized he shouldn't have a low-mileage, no rust vehicle at his house near
the beach (Does that make it a rescue?) Been thinking of selling off the
daily-driver Squareback for a Double or Single Cab for a while so we jumped
in the car and went out to LA to check it out (from Phoenix, AZ).  Finalized
the deal, drove it home, no problems.  Here's a short description, more to
come, including pictures:
Approx. 55K original miles
Upgraded to 12-volt system, 1300cc engine, tranny, etc..
Original interior, very good condition
Fairly complete - semaphores, taillight, rims, etc. are there
99% rust free
Original paint, original factory spare tire
Neat original toolkit, original factory spares, etc..

I'm so excited!!!!

So...

I am formally putting the '65 Squareback S up for sale.  I have put a list
of everything I could think of down below but here's a short description for
those interested:

'65 Squareback, 141K original miles, original paint, used as daily
driver for about 1 year, around 6000 miles.  A lot of new parts plus a lot
of extra parts go with it, roof rack, tow hitch, parcel tray, etc., etc.
$2500 obo for car, accessories, everything!

I previously said $2K firm, which stands for any listee - Type 3, Type 2,
etc..

It's located in Phoenix, AZ and I can deliver it and all the extra parts
anywhere within a reasonable distance (500 miles) if purchased first.

There are pictures on my web site, of course.  My phone# is 602-869-0834.

Thank you,
