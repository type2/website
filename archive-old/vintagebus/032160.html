This is really tricky IMO. I've had some success though. Obviously you've
got to get a feel on the person real quick. What's worked for me is to go
at it with &quot;the common man (or woman)&quot; approach. Don't show up in your
fancy duds or a fancy car. And I wouldn't show up in your restored bus
either. Don't give up the fact that you are a total VW freak. I usually say
that &quot;I like working on those old VW's&quot;. Call the bus &quot;that old VW van&quot; or
&quot;that old hippy van&quot;. 

Another thing is I don't go into it like I want to buy the bus. I usually
ask if I can take a look at it and try and get them to tell me stories
about it and all that. Basically just chatting. I think everyone likes to
chat and it helps you to get a feel on them. Main thing is to not start
getting into vw technicalities....like &quot;are you sure this is a '61...VW
used bullet turn signals and this one doesn't have those.&quot; Just go with the
flow and let the owner do the talking. I've heard some great stories about
busses and vw's this way. That alone makes stopping worth the trip.

Another option is to bring your girlfriend. I have to admit that my wife
has &quot;broke the ice&quot; many times for me. Works better with the
junkyard/mechanic type of guys for sure. She's scored me some safari's, a
vw emblem, and a few other nice items ALL BY HERSELF. Not too bad for
someone who married into VW's.

Main thing is to not be a fancy pants vw know it all collector kind of
person. You'll never get a good deal that way. All you do is put $$$$ signs
in the eyes of the owners. Just be patient, polite, and personable. And
expect to walk away with nothing...because more often than not that's what
will happen.

Have fun!!!!
