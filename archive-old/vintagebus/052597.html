Subject: Crossing Paths and that dreary old song

AULD LANG SYNE

In preparation for Christmas I decided to brave the local shopping mall. All
presents were purchased except for my wife. Every year I struggle with my
choice for the one that love the most. During this self-inflicted social dance
of angst a familiar face passed me in the crowd. I momentarily continued on in
my quest wondering where I had known that oldish looking man. I knew that I
knew that I knew him and that we had somewhere crossed paths. Because of my
conviction I turned around, caught up to him and tapped him on the shoulder. I
asked if his name was Ornelas. I could have sworn that his father was my most
memorable one-armed and golden hearted little league coach. The old man
answered, &quot;No, but it's Cisco, Danny Cisco. Tom Ornelas was my best friend.&quot;
At that moment I gasped realizing that we had grown up together on the same
residential street and had attended school together from kindergarten through
high school. We are the same age. He was out shopping for his wife and grand
kids. His kids are out of the house and out on their own... Damn. We parted
company reentering the cosmic soup of society mulling our separate fates and
fantasies. I continued to seek the perfect gift for my pregnant wife and
two-year-old daughter. The two ladies had without knowing it already given me
mine.
That that dreary obligatory song that Robert Burns thrust upon society (Auld
Lang Syne) is wrong if misunderstood or taken out of context. God knows that
the Scot-Irish can never get to the point.  Besides melancholy drunks on New
Years Eve with booty on their minds are not known for critical analysis at
midnight.  &quot;Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?&quot;  No,
as the song goes on to suggest, we should embrace the memories and shared
experiences- saluting them for what they were (or remain to be). To some degree
I have always discarded this little ditty as being a depressing pinnacle to a
long day at a late hour. Growing older and having network connections with
Cisco suggests that perhaps I have given it an undeserved bad rap.

As I continue to cross paths in life with many individuals I cherish everyone
for one reason or another. If we have crossed paths then I count myself as
being blessed, happier and more enriched for that experience. Thanks for
sharing those slivers of your life with me. If I have ever made you smile or
laugh then my mission has been accomplished.

We may occasionally curse our fate or self for decisions that have been made or
theoretic paths not taken. Contemplate for a moment that if any single decision
had been changed you would not possess the friendships, kinships, loves and
knowledge that you currently enjoy. We all have crossed paths for a reason.
 
The song, like life, can be perceived as dreary if taken out of context or
misunderstood. If we remember that seemingly ordinary crossing of paths may
lead to friendships and unseen blessing then it reminds us to keep perspective.
Take a second in your private thoughts and raise a hypothetical glass or prayer
to the gift of having shared this miracle of life. Then smile.
Happy New Year,
Jim Ellis
(Scot-Irish, and getting to the point).
