I didn't work too hard today.  My left hand is sore, my hands and arms are
starting to crack and peel from frequent scrubbing to remove the oil, and a
few other aches and pains that have slowed me down.

I don't really recall the order in which I did the following but it did get
done so bear with me.  I went to the lumber yard and grabbed some 5/16&quot;
threaded rod (2 three footers and 2 twelve inchers) along with a couple of
couplers.  Since the VW beam is just about 3 foot wide, it was gonna take a
good 4 foot to have enough threaded rod to stick out on either end.  I
headed over to my grandfather's house and cut some scrap toobahfohz in 4
nice little squares.  I also cut 4 pieces of rubber out of a scrap tractor
innertube.  Next I drilled holes through the blocks and then through the
hunks of rubber.  I ran the threaded rod though the beam and then slid the
pieces of rubber over each end.  Next I put the 2x4 blocks over each end
followed by a 5/16&quot; fender washer and nut.  After carefully centers the
rubber and wood over the axle beam hole, I torqued the nuts down.  This kind
of made a sandwich out of the axle tube but this puts a lot of pressure over
each end of the axle tube so that the sand from the blasting won't get in
the bearings.  I also installed the center grub screws in the beam and
tightened them up.

Tonight I removed the clutch pedal arm, throttle &quot;L&quot; lever, and the brake
lever with MC pushrod.  I also tried to remove the e-brake lever pin and it
is rusted in really tight. I think I'm going to have to leave it alone.  The
lever works tight right now but I think some wd40 and pumping the lever in
time to some good music will really help to loosen it up.  I also discovered
the stop for the brake pedal was bent, allowing the pedal to WHAM up
underneath the bus everytime you took your foot off of it.  I went to bend
the piece back and it moved a little too easy.  Turns out, it's starting to
crack so I set it where I wanted it and will have to drag out the welder and
weld up the crack and then some.  The bushing for the clutch pedal was
little loose but I think if it was properly greased, it would get me by for
a while.  I'm thinking of drilling a little hole in the frame and then into
the clutch tube bushing and installing a zerk so that the clutch lever can
be greased along with with the front beam during the scheduled maintenance
intervals.  Any comments on this?  It looked to me like the clutch pedal
pivot bushing is 2 pieces - one on each end.  There might just be enough
room in the pivot bushing housing to install a zerk.  I'm not sure yet
though.

I took the little air drill, put in a wire wheel, and finished the tight
areas that my helpers missed.  They really did a good job - all the corners
that had dirt building up were dug out.  I just had to catch a few cobwebs
and loose dirt/rust areas and now everything is ready to POR15 underneath.
I took the airhose and finished blasting all the loose material out.
Because of that, I'm a terribly filthy mess - I've got dirt on my glasses,
in my ears, and in my hair.  The front of my overalls look like I fell face
down in an oil pit.  It's all in a days' work though. :-)

I cleaned the front wheel bearings and one says FAG - the rest are Timkens.
The seals were original VW style with a felt pad sandwiched between 2 metal
rings.  The bearings seems loose and worn enough to justify replacement.
Keeping in mind that I'm going to do some serious traveling with this bus, I
think replacment is a must for peace of mind factor if anything.  I took the
wire wheel and decrusted the drums inside and out.  I left the freshly
turned areas alone of course.

I was going to work on the steering box tonight but I'm too tired.  I think
I'll take a couple of hose clamps and bicycle inner tube and hose clamp it
over the end of the steering box shaft and housing so that I can get it
sandblasted as well.  There is a lot of gunk and undercoating on the box and
I think it and the bracket would clean up really nice.

That's it for tonight.  Painting of the under side of the bus floor will
commence as soon as my order or POR15 shows up.  My helpers are anxious to
get started after taking today off for a fishing trip.  (Can I blame them?)
:-)

Later!
