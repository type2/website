Dear list:
I have just finished my 66 deluxe (YAY)  went for our first ride
Monday it was kinda noisy (I have a 76 westy that's real quite). Not having
driven a spit in 30 years maybe I forgot how loud they are? Today I changed
the trans oil and the oil in the redux box's, changed a front wheel bearing
and repacked they other. It was a bit quieter but still noisy.  I could not
trace the noise to any one area, only that its coming from the back of the
bus. Is this Normal?

when driving, it is normal for noises to come from theback of the bus.

but cause we can't hear you , it is really hard to say how loud it too loud,
or if the noises or funny (bad).  Do you know some local (where are you) VW
person who would know who could be persuaded to go for a ride ?
