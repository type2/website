&lt;&lt;2.) is there a difference in rear wheel wells between Split and early Bay? 
I think I've seen like 69 or 70 Bay at a local junk yard;&gt;&gt;
Yes there is a big time differance!

Sorry to be a spoil sport but yes from i think 64 split up to i think 71or  
the wheel wells are interchangedable , been there did that on Gene Hickman's 
67 on my showcase page ,less than 6 months after it was restored ,,then he 
showed it at Mannassas Bug out last spring took best bus in his class,,,,you 
have to cut the front of the panel to match your rocker,and cut the rear and 
rebend the flange to attach to the rear corner , but it can be done ,,and i 
have pics to prove it ,,the panel came from Wolfsburg West around $ 30.00 i 
think ,,sorry Eric and Barb ,
