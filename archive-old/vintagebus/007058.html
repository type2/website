&gt; &gt; I just purchased another 1959 deluxe and am curios about the markings on
the
&gt; &gt; windshields. Both are marked in the upper inner corner with &quot;VER DELOG
BUND&quot;
&gt; &gt; inside an octagon with AS1 below the octagon. Anyone know if this is
after
&gt; &gt; market replacement glass or another OEM supplier to VW.

The Westfailure has two Delog windshields. I believe they are original to
it, but of course have no evidence to support it. I have also seen popout
glass with the Delog logo. I haven't ever seen it on anything early. The
Westfailure is a '67 and the popout glass I've seen was off of a '66.
