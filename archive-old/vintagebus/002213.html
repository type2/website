&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I can see right now that I am in the wrong business!!!  Thanks Kabayo,
now I
need to go back to school and get a masters in welding! :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
You don't get a masters in welding, for the simple fact you'll aways be
learning new stuff every year.I still learn everyday almost and i have been
welding for damn near 30 years (come July as a matter of fact). There is
alot more to welding than picking up a welder and going at it. thicker metal
is more forgiving in a sense. Sheetmetal (vw or otherwise) is a different
animal. There are as many so called &quot;welders &quot; as there are so called
&quot;restorers&quot; doing some of the restorations that i'm re-rustoring .
