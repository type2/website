&lt;&lt; At what RPM do you change gears? &gt;&gt;

Hi Rex,
Except for first and reverse never go below 1,500 RPM and even in those two 
exceptions you want to get it up to 1,500 ASAP without drag racing it.  Go 
below 1,500 in second trough fourth gear lugs the engine and shoves the 
crankshaft into the bearings!  For top cruise RPM we have found 3,000 RPM 
gives best engine longevity, MPG and speed all at once.  This RPM only 
exceeded for short periods to prevent going below 1,500 RPM when shifting up 
a gear or trying to squeeze a little more acceleration on one of those short 
and/or uphill onramps.  Though in outside temps over 80F dropping down to 
2,500-2,800 RPM really helps to keep the oil temp well down below 230F.
