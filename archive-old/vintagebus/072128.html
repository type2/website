&gt; Someone asked about brakes etc .. I complete replaced the brakes.  Master
&gt; cylinder and so on.  Emergency brake cable is broken, that needs to be 
&gt; fixed,
&gt; but the rest of the braking system is brand new.

Hi Diane,
Good!!  Just in case though, make sure to replace the flexable brake lines if 
they are over five years old or who knows how old they are.  Otherwise they 
each tend to turn into a one way valve, and lock that brake up, .  BTDT!!
