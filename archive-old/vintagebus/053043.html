Subject: Re: [VB] Wobbly belt?

just a few other suggestions that may help:
have you checked the lower pulley for warpage/bent?
also, what brand of belt are you using? and is it the correct size. alot of
times new belts (continental in my experience) will stretch in the first
few hundred miles and need somewhat regular checking/tightening. i have
also found that some &quot;flaps&quot; no-name, sorta-the-right-size--maybe, &quot;this
one'll work&quot;, wrong width belts have unusual problems sometimes.
just to re-suggest, have you taken the gen pulley (without belt) and tried
wiggling the front half against the rear half? even the late model pulleys
wear out and any majorly noticeble &quot;rock&quot; in the pulley could cause weird
slippage things.
and not to be too picky, but how are the keyway slots in the pulley and the
generator armature itself? 


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt;  Would generator bearings be a good bet if my belt wobbles (vibrates
&gt;  slightly in and out in the same axis of the pulleys), even though it is
&gt;  tightened to 1/2 deflection. Vibration diminished at engine expansion
&gt;  warmup, and is negligble at 1250+ rpm...I turned pulley like crazy when
&gt;  tightening, she's not crooked. I learned that lesson, along with using
&gt;  ALL the  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
