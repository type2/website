Ok I didn't mean to start a flame war with the &quot;hippies&quot; lol.  I love my bus 
and gladly missed out on that era of our history.  I am not a hippie and 
don't want to be associated with the stereotypical view of our society of a 
hippie.  They had great ideals and some fought for what they believed in and 
some even went to fight in Viet-Nam.  Then there were the ones who spit on 
our soldiers and dodged the draft.  Anyway, like I said earlier I didn't 
mean start a flame war.  I am gonna have to buy that bumper sticker now, &quot;I 
beat up 4 hippies and all I got was this dumb ole' bus&quot;.  I guess the 
&quot;hippie bus&quot; is part of our culture and those of you that are or rather were 
hippies, &quot;peace&quot;.  what happened to the Motor Rebuild Report and Burning Man 
Event part of this message?
