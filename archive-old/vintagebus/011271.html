Subject: Anyone want VW front symbol??
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I went to the local flea market last saturday and among other things I bought
a chromed VW front symbol.

when I checked it is about an inch smaller in diameter than the one on the
front of my 63 singlecab. So no use to me.

Anyone want it or have something to trade.
What I really want is the treasure chest lock cover for the passenger side. It
is a small chrome thiby that is shaped like a figure eight.

I have it in cupertino.
