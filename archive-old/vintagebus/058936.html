Subject: swing lever bushing dimensions

Hello everyone,

I'm at work, and I've got a machinist buddy that can make me a replacement 
swing lever bushing to replace the one that I screwed up last night.  Is 
there anyone out there that could give me the measurements (I.D., O.D., 
Length) for a swing lever bushing before it's pressed in the beam.  If I can 
get it within the next coupla hours, I can get it made and get it in 
tonight.  I can also borrow an adjustable reamer out here, and I can clean 
up one of the swing lever pins I've got, so I can finish the job tonight.  
Just to make sure, the final diameter of the bushing AFTER reaming should be 
0.950&quot;, correct ?(got that from the vintagebus how to section, thanks Thom)

Mike A.
