&gt; Here's another variable for you whilst adjusting your valves....
&gt; This is how I've done mine for years with no problems. I call it the 3-1
&gt; method
&gt; 
&gt; Get engine to #1 TDC
&gt; Adjust #1 intake and exhaust , #2 intake (3 forward most on right side of
&gt; vehicle) then do #4 exhaust (rear most on left side)
&gt;

&gt; the other.

This is a great method if you have a brabd-new and stock crank.
Otherwise, you should really use the exact tdc of each cam lobe. The
sides may not be the exact same on either a hot-cam with non-stock ramp
or a cam that has been used/reground a couple times. 
I can do it the old way in about 8 minutes. Why take the chance that you
are setting them wrong?
