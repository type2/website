&lt;&lt; This really seems funny that most of this seems like camping set up stuff, 
other than the sliding door. Most of the busses that had M361 are 59 and 
early 60 Double cabs. Did the M codes ever get reassigned as something else 
at a later date? &gt;&gt;

I tried to search the vintagebus_dot_com registry and it didn't work for me

but, yes, M codes did get reassigned meanings over time
