Gee, I thought I was the only one to notice.  I don't think VW Howard really 
meant anything by it and even if so I can understand the response - kind of 
like those furniture stores that have a &quot;Going out of Business&quot; sale twice a 
year, every year, for the past ten years.  Let me assure you I *really* am 
moving.  Looks like mid to the end of July.  Just wanted to sell the big 
items so I didn't have to pay to have them moved 1300 miles.  

Of course once I to Florida I'll start filling up another garage.  I'll 
probably have a sale every year about May - just before hurricane season.  
Don't want to have to haul all the big stuff out during an evacuation. 8-)
