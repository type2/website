&lt;&lt; I saw what you meant by the close proximity of the cable end and the
 solenoid electricals. When I was under and saw that, I thought hmm, very
 un-german. I had the battery disconnected so I was able to examine the full
 swing of the arch, and all is clear.&gt;&gt;
Hi Glen,
Yes it is perilously close.  So must be set correctly and tested as you did
with the battery dissconnected.

I looked at this today while I was under my 61 (has fuel reserve tap)  and
there seemed to be plenty of clearance.   But I have noticed that different
VW starters  are different lengths and I may have a shorter one in there.
 You may want to think about getting a shorter one when you next need a
starter, if that is the differnce.
