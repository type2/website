Subject: Starter going?

Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, I just spent a week in Vegas... guess what I won?  Nothing.  That's
right, I paid for a few lightbulbs that seem to make everyone oooo and ahhh
there.  Anyway, I did a little road trip to and around the Grand Canyon and
didn't see one split window bus.  I'm a little bummed to tell you the truth.
We need more drivers out and about.

Now getting on to the subject.  When I got back, I drove 'Annie' down to the
parent-in-law's house to pick up the dog.  A wonderful drive.  I didn't know
how much I missed the bus until I spent a week in a Dodge-me Durango rental
with the family.  Anyway, on the way back I swung through Emory's campout in
McMinnville, OR.  Not much left on a Sunday afternoon.  Swap was cleaning up
before the dark clouds on the horizon hit.  Most of the things at this event
are Porsche anyway, but there are always a few bus's there.  A couple of
really nice campers were my drooling points.  A '54 red/black one was just
supreme.

Getting closer to the subject... When I tried to leave, I turned the key and I
got nothing out of the starter.  Lights came on, but no click, no nothing.
I've been through this before... I crawled under with a crescent (biggest tool
I had) and gave the starter a couple of good whacks.  Got in again and she
started right up.  It's been a month or so since I had to do this last time.
I figured it was a short term, but monthly process I had to go through until I
get the starter out and replaced/cleaned up.

Now we get to this morning, no start.  Grrrr-n-stuff.  I can give the starter
another whack, but my question to y'all is... will this likely just get worse
and worse until I have to replace the starter?

- Is just under $100 a reasonable price for a new/rebuilt starter?
- Is pulling the engine the best way to get in and replace the starter?

Any experience based advice would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg
