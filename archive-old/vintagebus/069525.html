Subject: Re: VW &amp; Intellectual Property issues

Chris -
&gt; So CafePress has sent me the below letter regarding my 
&gt; vintage bus items at http://www.magnobeam_dot_com/vb_store.html
&gt; A couple questions, or ponderings, for those whom have gone through this.

My unlawyerish recommendation is to politely reply 
requesting specific details of which images or
items are considered to be in potential violation
of the Intellectual Property. Instead of caving in
completely and taking down your entire site, put it
back on them to explain and show exactly what it is
that they are complaining about and to explain why.

They are accusing you of infringing on their intellectual
property, but only in vague terms. Inform them that only after
you have received specifics on the accusations of which 
images, and exactly how each infringes on the IP issues, 
can you respond with any responsible answers concerning 
their specific issues. Your site contains many images, and
it is incumbent upon them to show cause as to why images
on your site should be removed.

They have made an accusation without stating specifics, 
and without those specifics, you cannot answer with any
clarity or precision to their claims.

I don't know if this has been tried, but I feel that without 
backup and specifics, they are shot gunning and simply hoping 
you shut down without a fuss, but without knowing what their 
problem is, you can't determine your next action.

Jeff no bus, no site, some clue
