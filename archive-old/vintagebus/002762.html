What a wonderful beautiful show it was!  I was in total VW heaven the whole
time - it was literally like some kind of VW high.  This was due in part to
me finally making it to AND entering a VW Show.  And to my delightful
surprise, I took 3rd in the show with my beat up old 67 bus!  YES!!!

Anyway, to start from the beginning:

I left Beatrice sometime Friday evening - later than I should have but I was
beat from a hard day at work.  I took 2 laner roads all the way to Omaha and
ended up some some Highway 275 that I wasn't supposed to be on.  I got
disoriented.  It cost me all of 30 minutes but I rolled up to the Pizza
Place in Benson about 10:30 and Rob was already outside flagging me down.
It was nice to be in familiar company after the 2.5 hour trip there.  We
chatted for while and then after clearning out of the Pizza Place, we mosied
on over to Rob's house.  Dan Buser (an old VintagVW listee), Wendy (his
fiance), Rob, Justin, and I caravaned to Rob's house.  The evening was full
of the normal VW chat and finally I crashed the party by going to bed on the
floor in the other room.  I was tired okay? :-)

Next morning we got a late start but Rob managed to nurse his 72 Westy with
the shot tranny to the show where Terry Wolfe (65 repainted Westy) was
waiting for us along with tons of other VW enthusiasts.  We used my bus to
haul the door prizes and sound equipment to the HQ tent and I gave some
anonymous little boy a ride (he helped unload door prizes.)  He was all
smiles saying that he had never ridden in a bus before.  I like to make a
kid's day like that! :-)

The rest of the day was spent looking at the swaps, sitting under the tent
between Terry's bus and mine, and just carousing around meeting listees and
other fine VW folk.  Pink Newell and RIck Taylor made it up from KCMO to
check out the going's on.  Gary, the black 55 oval daily driver guy showed
up as well.  We personally invited him from the KCMO show because we were
impressed that he daily drives his stock 55 oval to work and where ever he
wants/needs to go.  Very impressive...semaphores and 6v system intact!  The
radio even works. :-)  Georgia, one of our lurking listees, showed up from
all the way across Iowa.  It was quite the drive for her but we talked a
little bit and she got to meet the NQ - the face and overalls behind the
name.  She had her kids with her (sorry I don't remember names!) and her
neighbor friend Amanda I believe it was.  All were great VW folk.

As far as the bus line up, I really digged this.  We had Tiffany there in
her 72 Dormobile.  This 20 year old gal is a wonder to behold.  She bought
this bus and has toured the east and west coast with various friends.  It's
her &quot;car&quot; as she calls it and I find it fascinating that these young 'uns
will travel that far on their own.  I freak out driving to Omaha! :-)  It's
the pioneers like Tiffany and Diana Krebs that keep a lot of us older and
more timid VW owners going.  Way to go Tiffany!

Next in line we had Brad (can't remember his last name) with his immaculate
custom-interiored 21 window 1967 deluxe.  What can I say?  This bus rocks
and took 1st place splitty bus and most desireable at the show.  He deserved
it!   We also had Rob in the 72 Westy (with Westy side tent I might add!),
Terry and I in our splitties, and Glen Hadley from Hamburg/Cedar Rapids, IA.
Everyone with a poptop had it up, full camping regalia set up, and Glen even
setup and cooked his dinner right there in the show area!  I missed out on
the free meal - Glen said he had some left over and couldn't give it away -
I was probably over in lala land at the time.  Anyway, we had 3 split window
buses and 3 baywindows so it worked out absolutely perfect that EVERY bus
owner won a plaque for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!  I likened my 3rd place win to the
special olympics of VW bus awards.  Can you say, &quot;I'm spethal?&quot; :-)  Glen
and I got a good kick out of this but as Terry Wolfe said, &quot;You went through
the mechanicals and lot of work to get to the show - it was great to get an
award for your efforts,&quot; and it's with this view that I bear my 3rd place
win with pride! :-)

After the show we did the cruise but not very many people drove it - only 7
or 8 I think.  We relaxed at Flashback's Bar and Grill for an hour and all
the available VW club kingpins/nuts hung out there.  I enjoyed this - even
though I don't drink - I was able to enjoy the VW conversation while sucking
down a much needed pop courtesy of Rob.  Plus the air conditioning was
welcome after spending the day outside.

That evening I was tired so I elected to stay at home while Rob and Tiffany
hung out at the lake.  Justin and I found a Burger King that was open later
around 10:00 or so and found a Burger King located on Saddle Creek Road in
Omaha with a sharp 1964 blue bug sitting in the parking lot.  Of course, we
parked next to it and no sooner had we done so and the guy at the drive
through window came out.  Turns out, it was Eric, the manager of BK and it
was his beetle!  He had checked out the show earlier that day and continued
to tell me how great the Omaha guys were (Phil Cram and Dick Bozarth the
carb king!).  He joined the club earlier that day with the special 5 buck
off promo they were having.  HIs engine is just like mine - a 1776 with
stock heads and dual carbs and he was needing Dick's help for the carb
tuneup.  After more chatting we found out the lobby was closed but he opened
the doors &quot;just for us VW nuts.&quot;  Other people were walking through the
drive-thru and coming up to find the doors locked and we had the whole place
to ourselves.  Even the value meals we both ordered merely came to $2.11 -
we were treated right. :-)  When we were done, Eric bid us farewell and let
us out the door.  Turns out Eric is from Houston and has been in Omaha for a
year.  He's looking forward to getting involved in the club so I hope he
enjoys it as much as I have.  He's also got a wife, 2 kids, and he appears
to me to be in his late 20's/early 30's.

Justin and I went home, burped, watched TV, played guitar, and crashed.  Rob
stumbled in sometime in the night and the next morning we were all just
beat.  I finally got ready around noon and Rob and Tiffany took off shortly
thereafter to take her bus to get some work done to it.  When they returned,
Rob came in and got me.  I walked outside and saw a cream over green 1966
panel bus with westy windows hacked into it.  At first I thought Rob bought
it.  Turns out that these 2 guys and girl are road tripping from San Diego
to the East coast.  They fixed this bus up and went to a big hippy gathering
in Montana.  (Anyone else heard about this? - a guy at the Omaha show was
telling me about it.)  They were on I-80 around Kearney, NE and blew out 4th
gear.  I had a trans to sell them but it was back home so one thing led to
another and I was on my way home.  I picked up the trans and hauled it back
to Lincoln where Terry Wolfe relayed it back up to Omaha for the guys to
install.  They seemed so very thankful because it took them 2 days to move
200 miles (large part of that in 3rd gear and other breakdowns.)  They had
people mad at them for driving slow and were flipping them off so they made
a sign in the back window that said something about sorry we're slow - no
4th gear.
I'll have pictures of the bus and the trio so you can see just how nice a
California bus looks.  Can you say original rockers with no rust?  WOW!  One
interesting mod they did was that they had the 38 amp generator that had the
wrong backing plate/hub which caused their v-belt to not line up and
subsquently shred.  Their fix was to weld another pulley on the crank pulley
and grind out the center of the added pulley and bingo - a properly spaced
pulley.  When times are tough, you go with what works. :-)

That pretty much was the weekend in a nutshell.  I had the best time so far
at the Omaha Show and the highlights for me were the bus showing, the VW
people, and Randy Yates 455 V8 powered Ghia.  I'll have pix of that
available soon.
