Subject: Question about VWTrends
Date: Sat, 13 Jan 2001 09:15:34 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I need some advice as to what to do at this point.

At the Omaha VW Club show in July of 2000, I won a free subscription to
VWTrends in the raffle.  I filled out the paperwork and mailed it in to the
address that I was supposed to and included a letter that really bragged up
the Show in Omaha - hoping to garner some attention from the magazines.
It's was a great show.

Anyway, here it is, January of 2001 and I still haven't received any free
issues or a notice of anything until yesterday when I get a promo card that
says, &quot;I can get 2 free issues of VW Trends&quot; and if I like them, I can
subscribe for another 10 issues for $15.95.

I want my free subscription.

Who would I write to or talk to about this?  I would like of like my door
prize to be fulfilled - after all - they sent Rob the papers for this and
then when they don't honor it, it makes me question just how good their
accounting department is.  I hate dealing with magazine places that like to
screw up your and financial standing with them.  BTDT and that is why I
currently don't sub to any mags at all.
