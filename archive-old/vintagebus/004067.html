Hello All, and fellow Moonies :-)

I hope every one had a good time at Everybus, as you might know we had our
vacation last week in Vail, Didn't see a single Split bus, Several Bay's and
lots of Vanagon's. I guess all the splits are still in Hibernation?

The 64 single cab has both wheel wells in with one still needing a little
welding, Finally got the gas to make the Lincoln a mig, and got the 60
Gallon
Ingersol Rand Air Compressor so I can finish the body work over the summer
and have the truck ready to paint next fall at class!

I uploaded a picture of some mirrors I found in a bus at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ under parts, any one know if their vw, no part
number could be found?

See ya _at_ Circle Your Wagons in May!

Meredith
