Hey john,
Go to my truck site  www.dropgates_dot_com  and click on &quot;year changes&quot; then
click on &quot;bumpers&quot; and that should help you out

&gt;I was noticing the different shape of the corners on the truck vs. the bus
&gt;and , when were truck bumpers used does it have to be a spefic truck bumper
?
&gt;or is it the same as a bus bumper I have a 1960 single cab as well as a
1965
&gt;double cab
&gt;what is supposed to be used on both of them ??
