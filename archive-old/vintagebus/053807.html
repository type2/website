Opinions wanted via *Pmail* please.

The Binz is now out of the paint shop so it is time to review the value =
I have it insured for.  The &quot;Old Car Price Guide&quot; doesn't list crew cabs =
time sometime in the 60's so it is of no help.  I think because it is a =
Binz it is worth a premium but not sure how much of one.  Yes, I know it =
is worth whatever someone is willing to pay but since I'm not selling it =
there really isn't a way to figure that out.  Would like opinions from =
VW veterans about what they think a restored Binz is worth...via Pmail =
please.

My thoughts:

I have been looking for over three years trying to find all the =
remaining Binz and from what I have found there are about 20 restorable =
Binz left.  Of the 20 a couple are questionable.  I'm sure there are a =
few more out there but not many.  Production on the Binz was about the =
same as or less than the Hebmueller.  About 60 Hebs survived compared to =
the 20 Binz.  I hesitate to draw the correlation between the Binz and =
the Heb as the Binz will probably never be worth what the Heb is but =
that would provide an upper limit.  As far as the low end I would say =
some percentage above a regular restored early crew cab.  Will be =
interesting to hear what folks have to say.

Thanks,
Dan
