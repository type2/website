Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

Here are my detailing secrets: I bought a plastic bug sprayer with a wand
from wal mart (holds three gal.) and then put one part simple green to ten
parts water in the sprayer. I cover the distributor with a rag or plastic. I
spray the motor, motor compartment, underbody, Wheel wells and rims of the
bus with simple green.  I wash the rest of the bus and then rinse all areas.

I dry all areas with an electric leaf blower (some friends use an compressed
air tank). This gets all the standing water from the motor, engine
compartment, front window seals and paint with air and keeps me from
&quot;rubbing&quot; the paint dry. Then do touch up and done. Also, if you have a
white wall or a white line on your tire, nothing works better that an SOS
pad to clean the white and make it bright.

This method is really a time saver. I got this method from an avid Harley
rider with a custom pint job on his bike. Use this on my bike to. The bug
sprayer places the simple green where I want it.

Cordially,

Hart
