	Good idea.  Nothing wrong with building a 'spare' motor from parts

	exactly the same components from whence they came......

	Things like bearings and related components establish wear patterns

rod 
	from which they have established a wear pattern will get 'false'
torque 
	readings on the fasteners, *fast* wear and very early failure....(
and I do
	mean very early.....)

	Gotta put in original spot or replace.  And if replacing the other
components
	must be pretty perfect before deciding not to linish, grind or align
bore - or you really are
	still faced with the same problem.  Nothing wrong with putting an
'original' 
	low wear (as measured) bottom end back together (esp. in a 'spare'
motor).
