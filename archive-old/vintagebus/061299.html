&gt; &gt; The Bentley has these very nice pullers shown in the book... But of course
&gt; &gt; those are not available to normal folks.  So what do you all use to pull
&gt; &gt; out the ball bearings?

Here's how I did it.  Take two bolts that are a bit longer than the
distance from the bearing to the end of the shaft.  Grind the head end of
the bolt thin enough to pass between the inner and outer races of the
bearing after cutting the head off.
Measure about 2/3 the bearing width back from the end of the part you
just ground and grind another 1/16 off of the bolt.  the profile looks
like this:

___    __________________________
|  \__/                         |   &lt;--threaded end
---------------------------------

Now put this into the bearing and let the end drop into the outer race.
Slide a 1/16 inch metal shim in on the side opposite the divot to lock the
bolt into the bearing.  Do the same thing with the other side of the
bearing with the other bolt.

Put a crossbar over the end of the shaft with holes drilled to accept the
two bolts.  Put two nuts on the bolts, clamping the bolts to the end of
the shaft.  tighen the bolts and the bearing will be pulled out.

I wouldn't use this method with a bearing I intend to reuse!
