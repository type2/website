&lt;&lt;Where does the channel go? Below the bed?  I've never seen or heard of
 one of these - got pix?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Well about 1987 I (Eric) saw one of these.  It was a single cab truck with no 
side intake engine vents.  Instead it had two ducts that were on the back of 
the cab and ran down under the bed to the engine compartment.  All of it 
looking like stock factory and would have been impossible to install without 
removing the bed sheet metal.   Eric&amp;Barb
