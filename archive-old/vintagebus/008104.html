Thanks to Clara, Woody, Billy, Thom and everyone else who responded to my
question about headlights.
The culprit turned out to be a faulty dimmer switch, which in my 66 is
shared with the turn signal switch. The dimmer switch has never really
worked, but a tug in the upward position has the lights back on and
dependable.
I drove for about two and a half hours last night with no problem, I had a
sleeping bag in the back just in case.
BTW Thom, I *did* hop out and check at the grocery store to see if someone
had stolen the lights.
