&lt;&lt; &gt;I have my choice of black or white. Which is correct for a 1967 deluxe? I
 am thinking black but......
 &gt;
 Deluxe = White
 Microbus/Standard = White
 Westy = White
 Generally all others = Black
 
 Barndoor Standards are Black, though...
 
 Hope I didn't mess up.
 
 Later, &gt;&gt;
actually there are two &quot;whites&quot;  one is &quot;ivory&quot;, kinda like french vanilla 
ice cream, and was used ?62 and earlier ?63 and earlier, after that they 
switched the &quot;white&quot; to grey, which also looks like white, but is not the 
same shade as &quot;ivory&quot;
