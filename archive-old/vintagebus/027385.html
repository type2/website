Subject: 63 oddities

hey all...
found a 63 in a yard with some oddities... or options.  I was talking to
Stephen White (he has seen this bus...and even parted a lot of it out)
and noted that the brake drums were different.  63 had a &quot;1 ton&quot; option
or something like that right?  What did this all come with and what are
the differences?  Was it a 1500 motor and upgraded brakes?  Was the
trans different or just the gearing in the redux boxes?

enlighten me folks
thanks!
