When I was at Bad Camberg, I hung out with Ricki and the English boys,
cruised around in THE LOWERED 21 window, double slider and was shocked in
amazment at all the LOWERED&lt; TRICKED OUT BD's and other buses. The best part
was they were done right. It seems that only us in the states are so anal
retentive on how a bus should be done.

ronnie.

ps. When at Pomona I was in a conversation with a bus purist and even he
complimented John Jone's on his FINE work on the DD-BD-AIR Bagged,
walkthrough panel. So even the purist can be swayed by quality work.

&gt;Ellis spake:
 If you are going custom then Rikki James
 &lt;rikki.james_at_random.co_dot_uk&gt; appears to be doing it
 right. See VWPlanet deluxe gallery. 
&gt;
Just a side note IT IS NOT RIKKI'sSBUS, he just submitted the photo to my
Gallery.

I guess Rikki has been getting some hate mail.  Stop it now, children.
