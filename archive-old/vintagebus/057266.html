Subject: what year

Hi List,
The double cab we looked at in Oklahoma Sat. is
supposed to be a 63 model. There are some differences
in the dash from my 63 so I wanted to run it by yall
and see what ya think. My 63 has a red light on either
side of the speedo for the e-flashers. The one we
looked at Sat. had only one to the left of the speedo.
The chassis # in the engine compartment is 1063551.
Can anyone tell me if this is in fact a 63 model or
not? My #'s indicate that my crew cab is a 63 that was
built in the fall of 62, but they're not even close to
these #'s.

Thanks,
3DPete
