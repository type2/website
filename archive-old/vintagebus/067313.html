Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Vintage EV VW

The single cab is a great candidate for EV conversion because of the treasure 
chest. Here's the other vintage VW from that eV album...

My comment about the cigarette lighter should have had a smiley, but this 
keyboard doesn't have one. 

I have a '74 EV Thing out back. It needs new batteries and battery boxes, I've 
been waiting for gas prices go to up and make the expense palatable. My 
conversion is similar to the bus, 9&quot; DC motor, etc. It is faster and has more 
acceleration than a stock Thing, the range is shorter of course. My commute is 
3 miles each way with occasional 10 mile jaunts, so it is ideal in flat, mild 
weather Fresno. 

Lead acid batteries are still the most cost effective, but some are using 
Optimas and other expensive batteries. My next set of batteries might weigh 
half as much and give me twice the range. Not possible with ICE (internal 
combustion engines.) 

Yes, that is an AC compressor. Modern EV conversions have it along with power 
steering, brakes, heat. Toyota built their RAV4 as an EV, but they just 
cancelled further production. It has 120 mile range and 100,000 mile guarantee 
on the battery but costs $40,000. 

You've seen hybrid vehicles for decades! They're called diesel-electric rail 
locomotives. You've been riding in electric vehicles even longer, they're 
called elevators. 

Henry Ford's wife drove an EV back in the early 1900's. Most women couldn't 
crank start a gas engine car. Ironically, the electric starter killed off the 
early EV industry. A VW link... Ferdinand Porsche's first car design was an EV 
back in 1915. It had two motors in the front wheels. He went on to design a 
electric powered wagon train, batteries on one wagon, motors in wheels on all 
the wagons.
