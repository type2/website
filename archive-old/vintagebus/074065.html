Subject: Cleaning Tip &amp; Question

Just came in from changing out the CV's on Theresa's bug and was I greasy.

Looked under the sink for the hand cleaner and remembered that we were out.

I spotted the bottle of Simple Green and put the stuff full strength on a 
sponge that had a scotch brite pad on one side.

That stuff made short work of the grease, arms, head, hands and everything.
Very quick and didn't over dry the hands like many cleaners do.
I even smell reasonably nice after the whole thing.  (amazingly enough).

dynomite stuff.

Now tomorrow I get to remove two broken studs where the exhaust bolts broke 
in the heads.  Both are sticking out about 3/16&quot; from the head.  Any sure 
fire tips?   (1600 T1 engine)
