Subject: Crank handle dimensions... - follow up

Thanks to all you dudes that quickly run into the garage and reached for 
the handle and measure!

I made up a handle and got cranking! unfortunatley I still couldn't get 
the motor to fire up - so I tried another suggestion and check all the 
wires - still no problem found : (  so I had flattened the battery 
through trying to start it so I took it off for a charge.

When I put it back on this morning I decided to clean up the terminal 
faces and battery clamps and also unbolted the battery strap and  
cleaned off the paint around the captive nut and then reinstalled the 
battery ...

the van fire up straight away! I guess (as suggested by Eric&amp;Barb - 
thanks) the drop caused by poor connections albeit battery or ground 
probably gave enough drop on start load to provide a really weak spark.

So I'm back on my merry 6v way ... : )  and I now have a crank handle to 
impress the neighbours with : )
