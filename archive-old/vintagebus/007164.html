Subject: Transmission on the road ...... where and what??

This is Tim again, the guy whose in MO with no fourth gear. everything is
set for a place to stay, tools and a spot to work on the bus at my relatives
in Kansas. Since I haven't had any leads at all on finding a used tranny, it
looks like the best bet would be to buy one from a company. Now that I have
this great vast many knowledgeable VW onwers, I would like to ask for a
little advice. I don't know much about transmissions or which VW parts
suppliers have the best quality for the money.
    So if you would, what type of transmission do I exactly have. I have a
66 standard Bus, from what I can see its the orig swing axle transmission
and its called a big nut type as apposed to ealier busses?? (what year did
they change). I don't mind going 55 on the highway, but know there are
options to change types of tranny that involves welding and some that don't.
I know people love to share their success and horror stories about
companies, and just love to give out advice, so I'm all ears. What do you
guys (girls) think would be the best route to getting 4rth gear back, on the
quicker side (don't want to wear out my welcome).

Many thanks in advance.......

Tim Watson..........
