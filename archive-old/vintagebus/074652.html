Subject: C.O.V.V.C. Columbus show and BNNTA stuff...

Hi all,

Kathryn and I just got back from the C.O.V.V.C. Volkfest show held on Saturday
in Columbus, Ohio over the past weekend.  Awesome was the best way to describe
it!  Perfect cool (high 70's) temperatures, extremely well run and organized
with a great volunteer staff, well over 350 &quot;entered&quot; cars in the show, a
bulging &quot;car corral&quot; of for-sale VW's, a huge swap meet with lots of great
used as well as lots of NOS goodies (I came back with some very cool items)
and lots of very friendly people.  Sorry some you guys missed it!  Maybe next
year?

In case any of you missed it, the web site with event info for the upcoming
BNNTA (&quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch&quot;) event can be found at
http://www.BNNTA_dot_com  and provides all of the basic info on the event.  I
believe that the Mapquest link is down, but we should have it back again soon.
Remember that you do not have to own or arrive in a Bus!  While most folks
will arrive in a Type 2, ANY model and year of VW as usual will be welcomed to
join in on the long holiday weekend festivities.  But remember that unlike
other VW events, you MUST be in a VW (any other make of car will not be
allowed to stay inside the campground).  Feel free to e-mail me with your
questions that aren't answered on the web site info page.  If you love to see
lots of VW's, camping and lakeside activities all weekend long, plan to come
join all of us at Mark Twain Lake near Hannibal, MO for this upcoming Labor
Day weekend VW event!
