oh yeah i forgot to say there is no good karma or bad karma really(even
though it might seem that way some times),       only karma

&gt; Now that's what I'm say'in.  NQ, look at the signs, first the old lady
gets
&gt; wacked, to be found the morning before you get a phone call about a bus
which
&gt; was involved in a murder.  Coinsidence???  Maybe, but what if it
isn't?!?!?!?  I
&gt; would love to have somebody watching over my bus.  Have you seen the movie
the
&gt; Sixth Sense or Field of Dreams.  I don't know if I believe in life after
death,
&gt; but damn....

&gt; &gt; sounds like good karma to me, if the man cherished his bus , and then
after
&gt; &gt; being murdered, managed to take one more ride in the bus , and besides
maybe
&gt; &gt; when the valves get tight he will tap you on the shoulder and remind you
to
&gt; &gt; tune.........
&gt; &gt; besides all that, have you tried looking up the old newspaper articles
on
&gt; &gt; the murder, you might find some nice pictures of the bus, or you might
find
&gt; &gt; that the old antique dealer is pulling your leg, either way you should
also
&gt; &gt; use the story to leverage down the price a little,
&gt; &gt; maybe the ghost rider is keeping the old witch away with those clutch
&gt; &gt; problems and waiting for the right guy to come along
