Subject: [VB] Hand Brake- Cables Too Short?

Hello,

My '55 has a floppy hand brake lever which isn't attached to the cables. I
spoke with a guy over the weekend who told me of his recent hydraulic brake
failure ('58 SC) and his hand brake wasn't working! This story convinced me
to fix my handbrake immediately. I crawled underneath the bus and found the
problem. The two cables are dangling out of the conduit tubes, they have no
retaining nuts on the threaded ends. Before I started digging through my
nuts and bolts jar, I wanted to make sure the cables would reach the
equalizer as they appeared to be short. I used a pair of vise grips to pull
on the cables...no movement on either cable. I assume one of the previous
owner failed to measure his new cables against the old set, and re-installed
shorter cables. After threading the cables through the tubes, maybe he
noticed his mistake and said f*ck it, and left the problem to a future
owner? Just a guess, but I can't think of any other scenarios.
I've never installed this cable, so I thought I would get the list's opinion
on what to do next.
Should I buy a new set of cables and re-install?  Could these be the correct
cables and there is an incorrect adjustment in the rear wheels causing the
lack of slack?
If your opinion is to buy new cables, do you have any tips on threading the
cable through the tubes....please say it isn't a royal pita to get the
cables to the front of the bus :-)
Thanks guys.

-Tom
