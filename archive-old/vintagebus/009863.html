Today is my official return to the vintage bus listserv after severly
curtailing my posts 3 months ago.  I've been putting most of my writing
efforts towards the Buskatiers list and the vintagevw list.  I just want
everyone to note that Mark Ahlbright (or whatever his name was) who leveled
the accusation against me that I post for egotistical purposes has never
once posted one message to the vintagebus listserve.  I suppose he thinks
that by doing so, I would accuse him of being egotistical.

So I'm back - no big fan fair or nothing.  I'll just be posting more than I
have in the past.  I think I've also grown a little bit thicker skin so if
I'm accused of anything more like this, I'll have this absence to reflect on
for proof that I don't &quot;NEED&quot; to post on this list to feed an out-of-control
ego.  I only post because I love to teach and show people things I've
learned in order to help them save time and enjoy working on their VWs.

NQ
