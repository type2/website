Subject: Re: [VB] Things to do while yanking my engine

Take a look at your throw out bearing, tranny mounts,
axle boots, engine seal, and you might as well change
the fuel line from the tank to the engine. have fun!

&gt; Hullo, list.
&gt; 
&gt; After owning Patience for a year and a half I am
&gt; pulling the engine (my first) 
&gt; to do a myriad of things.
&gt; 
&gt; The main reasons are to chase down a persistent oil
&gt; leak on the left side 
&gt; (guessing oil cooler on the 1600dp), get Time-Serts
&gt; put in the #2 and #3 
&gt; sparkplug holes, putting in new engine tin seals,
&gt; and put in air flaps in the 
&gt; fan shroud.  
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;While I'm at it,&quot; I am planning pressure washing
&gt; it, on getting new exhaust 
&gt; valves put in (no idea as to the old ones' mileage
&gt; -- no stretching yet), 
&gt; checking on the existence of a Hoover bit, flushing
&gt; the oil cooler, check on 
&gt; the clutch, checking the endplay, and replacing the
&gt; crankshaft seals.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone recommend some other common items I
&gt; should check on or do &quot;while I'm 
&gt; at it?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
