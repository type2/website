&gt;Hi,
&gt;I am writing to you asking for help. My husband owns a VW repair shop. He is
&gt;looking for a special tool for the older VW Bug, Ghias, and Buses. The tool
&gt;he is looking  is a swing axle wheel bearing puller. It pulls the bearings
&gt;out of the axle. A friend of ours purchased one about 20 years ago from a
&gt;German parts company and he is not ready to get rid of it. I was wondering
&gt;and hoping maybe you know where we could locate a special tool like that.



The tool has many arms on it, each of which fits between one of the balls
in the bearing.  Then a round collar slides over the arms, preventing them
from spreading while the center bolt is turned against the end of the axel.
The ones I have seen are black in color.

There is a similar tool for buses, for pulling the bearings of the
reduction boxes.  I would love to have one of these pullers.  If anyone
knows a source, please let me know.

TIA,

Kabayo
