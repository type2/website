Amen Brother Bob!,
In 1974 I was traveling southbound I-17 south of Flagstaff heading from College
toward Phoenix in a Ford Pinto at 75mph. At that time I-17 was an exaggerated
width one lane in each direction. No service lanes etc. Vehicles from both
directions decided to pass the car in front of them at the same time. Traffic
was suddenly four wide as I was point blank on the scene. This on coming
traffic caused me to slam on the brakes and turn that b*tch sideways and skid
sideways forever in a Bonnie and Clyde slow-motion special effect. I was able
thread the needle broady-ing serpentine like a garden gate JUST in time to miss
each car. I was able to straighten the car and continue on my way without
mishap or emptying my colon. I should have bit it then. 

Apparently inspite of myself there is/was a plan for my life. If so I have done
a pretty good job trying to undo it but remain happy. =) Hopefully I will not
eat it by anything related to fixing my splittie... in the fast lane of the
405.
- Ellis ;-o !
