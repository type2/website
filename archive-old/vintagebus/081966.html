&gt;Trying to fix my VDO oil temp gauge tonight and now my
&gt;truck won't start.  It has power to the coil, and gas
&gt;to the carb and it cranks over fine.

Assuming you've got good power to the coil:

At the coil, disconnect all wires except the high-voltage
wire and the positive wire (the one that also goes to the
choke element and carb solenoid, if equipped).  Attach a
jumper wire to the negative terminal on the coil - the
one that normally has the wire from the distributor in
a points set-up.  Go up front and turn the ignition on.
In back, unplug the high-voltage wire from the center
of the distributor cap and hold it about 1/4&quot; from a
good ground, like the coil mounting bracket, base of the
distributor, etc.  Not on the fuel pump or fuel lines,
please.  Touch the free end of the jumper wire to ground,
then pull it away, then touch it to ground again, and like
that.  You should get sparks at the high-voltage wire.
Note that the jumper wire will have spikes of up to a
couple hundred volts on it, so you might want to handle
it with insulated pliers or a clean dry rag or something.
If you can't get anything at the high-voltage wire, hold
the high-voltage wire closer to ground to see if you get
any sparks.

If you get no sparks at the high-voltage wire, or only
get sparks when it's held really close to ground, then
your coil is probably bad.  If you get good sparks at the
high-voltage wire, then your coil is probably OK and the
problem might be in the CompuFire.

I am not 100% sure on this, but you might try it:
hook everything up normally, and then hook up your test
light as if you were going to time the engine.  Turn the
ignition on, take it out of gear, e-brake on.  Turn the
engine with a wrench and your test light should flash on
and off.  If the light never goes out or never comes on,
the Compu-Fire might be toast.

I am more sure of this: hook everything up normally,
then hook up your test light with one end on the positive
side of the coil and the other end on the negative side
of the coil.  Have someone else crank the engine with the
starter, or use long enough wires on the test light that
you can see it from the cab while you crank the starter.
The test light should flash off and on as the engine
cranks.  If it doesn't, the Compu-Fire is probably bad.

If you want to check out the coil with a meter, take it
off the Bus and see
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/075632.html .

One more remote possibility is that you smoked contact 15
on the ignition switch.  It might appear to be delivering
power to the coil, but fall down under load.  There are
a couple of different ways to test this.  1:  Leave
everything hooked up normally on the coil, plus run an
additional wire from the positive terminal of the coil
to the positive terminal of the battery, the B+ (not D+)
terminal of the voltage regulator, or the tail light wire.
If you use the tail light wire, turn on the tail lights.
Then crank the engine.  If it starts with the jumper wire
in place, then something is wrong in your ignition switch.
2: Disconnect everything at the coil except for the wire on
the positive terminal.  Turn the ignition on and measure
the voltage between the positive terminal of the coil
and ground.  It should be pretty close to battery voltage.
Then, take a jumper wire and ground the negative terminal
of the coil, and measure the voltage at the positive
terminal again.  It might be a few tenths of a volt less
than your previous reading, but it should still be pretty
close to battery voltage.  If the reading has dropped
a lot, then most likely something is wrong with your
ignition switch.

I hope this helps!
