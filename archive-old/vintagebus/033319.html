&lt;&lt; where exactly is the water coming into the bus? between the glass to 
rubber area or the seal to frame area? &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
Most often from between the seal and the body.  Without sealant some water 
will work itself in between the seal and the edge of the glass.  Which 
attacks the plastic laminate in between the glass layers of safety glass 
turning it white on the lower edge of your windshileds.   Eric&amp;Barb
