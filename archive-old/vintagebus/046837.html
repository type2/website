&lt;&lt; It's just an attitude bit.  I bought a new Passat Wagon GLX with a VR6
 engine.  Took that to Santa Barbara a number of times.  It was quicker,
 quieter, even better on gas mileage.  But the bus was exciting just in
 itself.  If you're well equiped, you've done your maintenance, (or had it
 done, in this case) and you make allowances for distractions, the stress of
 &quot;Oh my God, am I going to make it?&quot; goes away, and you're left with driving
 a classic vehicle, people smiling and waving along the way, and a feeling of
 calm that settles upon those who can skip the latest and the greatest and
 enjoy a simpler life.
 
 Whoa.  The soapbox is tipping...

right, yesterday I ended up driving out in the country-  I forget how close 
we are to no where here sometimes,  get used to being in town and just a 
little driving ten miles past the res (cheap smokes) I still can't find the 
sign &quot;Big Al's Bunny Barn = for Pets or Meat&quot;  - I am not making this up- 
that was really one of my markers to where I was going, anyway it was nice 
cruising the back roads even though I got lost, well I wasn't lost, I knew 
where I was but I lost my way to where I was going so it just took a bit 
longer to get there but I didn't mind, gorgeous view of Mt Rainier looming 
above me.   later last night after all that was done I stop at safeway after 
work, run into a friend of a friend there, he says &quot;I saw your gorgeous bus 
in the parking lot&quot;  and when I am leaving Spaceway (the final frontier, 
these are the voyages of a shopping cart, on a 5 hour mission to buy plastic 
cheese food spread, frozen pizza, and anything else you can think of- to 
boldly go where no man has gone before... the ladies room) getting back to 
the bus there are some kids googling at it, pretty neat,  yes a trip may well 
be faster in a modern car, air conditioning and what else, but you can't beat 
driving a bus for the fahrvergnu:gen.
