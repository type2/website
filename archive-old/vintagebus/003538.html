Hey All,

            I had the same problems with my panels and what I have decided
to do is insert a nylon bushing into the hole in the door and then use
screws to attach the panels.I know this won't pass the Vintage Nazi
inspection but they will stay in place and can be removed MUCH easier.

        If you want to use the snaps, then be very careful when you remove
them(so you don';t break any) and have them replated.
    Also be sure to line the back side of the panels with plastic so you
don't get warping from the inevitable water which flows thru the doors
(front only).

            meine 2 pfennige,

                                             woody

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;



&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; What is the best material to use for interior panels for a 64-67 bus?
&gt;  I have redone all the screw in panels with 1/8&quot; hard board and they work
&gt;  great.
&gt;
&gt;  The front doors and rear hatch use the snap in clips.  the ones that you
&gt;  can get right now are too short to use with 1/8&quot; material.  What are you
&gt;  all using.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
,  enough so the snaps stay.  except a
&gt; couple popped.
&gt;
&gt;
