Well, prices are somewhat subject to locality.  For comparison, I just
bought a 1960 9-seater with 31,000 original miles for $5,000 here in
Colorado.  It's missing the passenger mirror, and needs various minor
things replaced (the driver's wing window latch is wrong, the fuel
line's ten years old, etc).  It's been stored for 27 years, and does
not have the original engine installed (but it *does* have a 40-horse,
so it's very close to original in that respect).  The headliner's
streaked (combination of condensation and sun-fade, by the looks of
it).  Drives beautifully.  This vehicle blue-books between $12,000 and
$20,000....
