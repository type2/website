Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

&gt;If I run ALL the cooling tin, with the exception of the very front piece
&gt;(flywheel end of the engine), my engine temps drop conciderably.

This is exactly what I was gonna try on my next bus. I'm thinking 
maybe putting a screen in place of the tin might help keep any 
unwanted debris from coming into the engine compartment....maybe not 
needed....what do you think?

Oh yeah, routing the exhaust from the doghouse into a hose that takes 
the hot air out one of the holes in the engine tin near where the 
heat exchangers get air seems like the way to take care of that so it 
won't be blown into the engine compartment. I'm horrible with 
terminology and trying to explain....hopefully I made that somewhat 
clear.

To me, this setup is THE way to keep your aircooled 
engine....well....aircooled.
