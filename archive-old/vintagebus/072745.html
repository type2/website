Subject: Re: [VB] Road music or not

A real no brainer for me. I'd take any south of the border jam before I would let myself submit to Bette or Celine. I would go so far to say that the sound of a knocking rod 1000 miles from home is more soothing that the sound of either of those &quot;divas&quot;!
