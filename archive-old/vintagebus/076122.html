Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 08-02-03

Today I decided to go ahead and get tires for my '61 Truck. The tires 
on the truck right now are good usable tires, but i needed something 
different for the Rat Rod &quot;look&quot; of the truck, so had decided to get 
some cheapo tires.

I chose to wrap the new rubber around a spare set of 15&quot; bus wheels I 
have instead of yanking the good tires off the wheels on the truck. I 
figure I can transplant that set to my '61 DD panel.

Last night before bed I went outside and sprayed all the wheels with 
a good coat of red paint so they'd be ready to go this morning. I 
dropped the wheels off at my tire place and got a set of 205 75 15's 
for $35 a piece total. I was looking for the (4) for $100 deal, but 
this was close enough. I decided to just come back and pick them up 
at the end of the day.

When I got back home I hit the tailpipe to muffler weld job again to 
fill some of the pin holes. I got most of them but still need to go 
one more time for one around the bottom back. (remember, yesterday I 
welded the tailpipe to the muffler instead of clamping it all 
together.) I decided to wait and mess with it again tommarrow.

I also officially installed the &quot;wolf whistle&quot;. Works great and is 
definatly cheesy as hell.

Next was the antenna. I don't have a stereo, but do have the hole for 
the antenna. I wanted something on there so snagged a used one from 
my buddy. I cleaned it up and polished it a little. Then bolted it 
on. I grabbed an orange &quot;76&quot; antenna ball from my stash and slapped 
it on. Nice touch!

I went back to the tire store and picked up my wheels. Tires look 
great. When I got home I leaned one up against the bus. The red wheel 
REALLY makes the truck look cool. I've still got to replace a few 
hubcap clips and do my &quot;wide white wall project&quot; before I install 
them. But I figured the tire store would be closed tommarrow and I'd 
just do this stuff on Sunday.

I'm shooting for being able to drive the bus around on Monday. I 
don't know if I'll make it or not, but it does look VERY possible. If 
I get done tommarrow I'll shoot pictures, otherwise maybe Monday or 
so.
