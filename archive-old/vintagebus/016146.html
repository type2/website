hey,
i knew that would get your attention. i was lookin around some personal 
websites waiting for 5 o'clock to roll around and i see some link to GEX's 
website on some dude's page. what the hell, i click on it and whats that i 
see... Thom's 56 sunroof on their main page. HUH! anyway, that is a great 
shot of his bus, it has been used before. i remember somebody made a vw site 
and used Thom's bus as the &quot;Samba Award&quot; given to people with cool sites....
