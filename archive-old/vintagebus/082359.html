Subject: Re: [VB] rims

The PO bought 15&quot; slotted chromes for my 62 at Wolfgang (www.wolfgangint_dot_com).

15&quot; gives a slimmer sidewall for less tire flex and more stability.

So, another question; how
&gt; common are 15&quot; rims to buy for a bus? Can they be bought new? Are there
&gt; used ones out there? I read where somebody had rims from different years
&gt; and that was the best he could do, so maybe not. Additionally, is there
&gt; any advantage to one size over the other?
