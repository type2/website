Hi Joe,
If the forks on the throw out bearing cross shaft is only spot welded (The 
two pieces pushed together and an electrical currant passed through top melt 
these parts together.) this leaves a rather weak welded joint.  Even with NOS 
German of these will fail if you are using a 200mm clutch system and 
especially a 200mm nine spring pressure plate.  Best to buy a pair of cross 
shafts and weld a nice bead around the base of the forks to insure they do 
not fail there.  Install one and keep the other on the shelf for a spare.
