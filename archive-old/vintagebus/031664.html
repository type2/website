But then again Thom, camping at the Red Barn, BUS swap meet and show has
nothing in common with the Job's you had the described and the OOH AAH
factor far outways anything, finding that NOS BD part at midnight over a few
beers far outweighs anything you might think of as camping. Then again
somebody else could buy it and sell it to you for a outragous profit.  ?:~)

ronnie    camping at a pre show is great

ps; again the London Bridge Bullis will be serving there famous TACOS on
Friday night at the Red Barn. How could you pass those up Thom.

After a few years with the California Conservation Corps, then a couple with
the US Forest Circus, then some more with the California Department of
Foresty,
I don't quite have the same view on camping and hiking as most folks.  I
guess
doing it for a living kinda takes the &quot;oooh! aaah!&quot; factor out of it.

&gt; somehow i got the impression that thom only camped when there was a room
with a shower (motel) next to his parking spot.  &lt;grin&gt;
