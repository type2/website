Actually, that is exactly what I thought as well, and the first
fund-raiser we ever had, we sold T-shirts. This turned out to involve
tremendous logistics and not much profit.

Take a $5 cap and sell it for $10. Sounds good, until you get a slew of
buyers from the Netherlands, or Australia. I think it cost around $18 to
ship an eight dollar T-shirt to Australia, and that was the cheap
shipping on a freighter. It took three weeks to get there.

So you've laid out 8 for the shirt and 18 for the shipping and you've
charged 18 because that is the most the market will bear for a lousy
T-shirt, you're 8 behind and that blows the profit out of the next two
shirts which you ship to Chicago and Dallas on UPS. All this is coming
out of your credit card and you are going to pay 8.25% interest on it.

Now you've shipped three shirts for ==nothing==. It goes on like that.
You can not tell the Australians that it is going to cost them $40 for
a shirt while the Americans pay $18 because (a) it insults them, and
(b) they won't buy the shirts then, and (c) they contribute a lot to
the list and it is wrong to diss them.

Same for the English and the Europeans and the Canadians, their shipping
is not as much but their Customs are awful

I'm not out to make anybody angry, especially *today*, I like Canadians
and Europeans and I like Australians a LOT. It's just that we tried it,
and selling merchandise turned out to be a bad deal for the lists and the
subscribers as well because of intermural concerns.

FWIW, by historical precedent, any of you who want to are free to
manufacture type2_dot_com merchandise and sell if for a profit if you want
to. This could change by consensus but it has been the policy since
1996 and is today. We do ask that you not use the &quot;official&quot; type2_dot_com
logo drawn by Jean-Baptiste le Pesant, because we're not sure we own it,
and we ask that you don't represent your merchandise as &quot;officially
sanctioned&quot;. Beyond that, do what you want, and if you choose to
contribute a share of profits, cool, we could really use it.

&gt;I've suggested this before and nobody was interested - because I think it is
&gt;such a great idea I'm a gonna suggest it again.  How bout if someone made,
&gt;say, baseball caps, say, in vintage bus colours or colour combinations and
&gt;there was an AIRS emblem on the front.  What would it cost to make such a
&gt;cap - $10.00?  It could sell for, say, $15.00 and the extra $5.00 could go
&gt;to the list. Who wouldn't want a nice Mango Green cap with an AIRS logo on
&gt;it - damn, I'd take 2.   It would be a little tough for someone like me to
&gt;do this - being in central Canada - but, maybe I could check into it if
&gt;there is an interest.
&gt;
&gt;1/2 hour before Friday -  easy big boy.
