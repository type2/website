Because you are a smarty can i ask you why the case for my 1500cc &quot;matching
numbers&quot; '67 B*g case has holes corroded (?) in the magnesium case around sump
plate hole? There was no drain plate on it and it had been sitting in a
hawaiian's chicken house for about ten years. All the studs were in it but there
were couple jagged holes about cm or less in size around the bottom case opening.

thanks
