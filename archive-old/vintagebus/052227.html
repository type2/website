Subject: Re: [VB] Music from the back

Is the noise present when you are stationary? I had a
cam gear come loose on me before. It started out as a
clank and after a while the bus started to sound like
a diesel!

&gt; I've been driving and enjoying my '67 Westy less
&gt; often since I moved
&gt; downtown.  Mass transit is often easier, cheaper,
&gt; and faster.  But I
&gt; try to find excuses to drive the bus whenever I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the bus has been making me scratch my head
&gt; recently.  For a while
&gt; I thought I must have forgotten how to set the
&gt; valves, since I had 
&gt; constant valve-sounding noise.  But every time I
&gt; checked, they were fine.
&gt; So I reasoned the noise was the warped pulley. 
&gt; Replacing that with a less
&gt; warped one (heh) didn't make it less.  So I bought a
&gt; new one, and got a
&gt; really straight generator pulley at a swap too. 
&gt; Both pulleys are straight
&gt; and true.  There's still noise, so I just figured it
&gt; was valves and
&gt; forgot about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Later on I was doing some work at Easterwood's
&gt; place.  Running the engine
&gt; I noticed that the noise seemed louder, and seemed
&gt; to be coming from the
&gt; center of the engine.  I verified with those present
&gt; that this was not a
&gt; normal sound for a VW engine to make.  We took it to
&gt; Ron's place a couple
&gt; days later since he had built the engine.  It
&gt; appeared to be the fuel 
&gt; pump making the noise, so I replaced both it and the
&gt; pushrod one day at
&gt; work...same noise.  
&gt; 
&gt; The noise is a clank-clank-clank that seems to come
&gt; from the neighborhood
&gt; of the crank pulley.  It's not super loud, and goes
&gt; away more or less
&gt; completely at any RPM much above fast idle, but it's
&gt; quite pronounced at
&gt; idle.  It seems to be louder when throttling down,
&gt; and maybe a little louder
&gt; when the engine is warm.  There's no slop in the
&gt; crank pulley at all and
&gt; it doesn't move in or out, up or down.  It's a 1600
&gt; DP with the only mods
&gt; being a full-flow case and a counter-balanced crank.
&gt; 
&gt; The next step seems to be pulling the engine and
&gt; dropping it off at Ron's
&gt; place...this is very difficult for me since I live
&gt; in the city, and this
&gt; is my only vehicle :-)  Can anybody think of
&gt; anything else I might check
&gt; before doing this?  It runs really great, but it
&gt; makes that noise...
