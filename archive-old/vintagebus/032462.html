okay-   bu t it is even easier to confuse the bug and the bus if you don't 
use &quot;type1&quot; in your original post, you used &quot;Volksie&quot;, and cause I was 
reading it off the vintagebus list I was thinking split screen buses (type 2s 
1950 through 67).  hope it works out.  check your fuel lines.  especially if 
you have not replaced them in a year.

VW is

this?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Don't worry about it.  It's easy to confuse the bus and the bug if you
use the name type 1 which can be used as another name for beetle. Type
1 is also another name for the first generation bus with the split
window.  My Type 1 is a 77' Beetle with FI.  So it has two gas lines. 
One runs from the tank to the engine and another one does the same but
the flow of gasoline is in the opposite direction.  Here's my latest
theory.  As I first start off driving there is more pressure in the
tank because of the heat.  once the flow of fuel starts moving through
quickly with the electric fuel pump the amount of pressure is just
enough to cause some leakage of gasoline out of the connections where
the rubber hoses connect underneath to the long length of metal fuel
line.  After the 5 min the pressurized fuel system goes down and the
leaking stops.  I will take the gas cap off and push the metal flap
inside open just before take off tomarrow.  I'll keep you guys
updated.  Any more ideas you guys might want to share would be greatly
appreciated.
