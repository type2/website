Agreed. 100%. How does it work?  The worst condition bus you drive the
better you are? We don't care about restorations anymore? I thought that
that's what it was all about.  I don't think that us just  talking about
it is gonna change anything. There always be people out there that would
buy the bus and beat on it. People that would do some weird modifications
(slamming included). People that would treat a bus not as &quot;family member&quot;
but as just another piece of junk to drive around town. There is nothing
we can do about it. It hurts though. It's not about just driving, it's
about caring. If he wanted to get to some great event like that, he
should of worked on his bus day and night and put some heart and sweat in
it. I think he was just very eager to show off, let everybody know, he's
got THE BUS!! Yeah!!,,,,,,,,hello! we all have buses!! and what?
(I don't think I'm gonna take chances and drive the bus I just bought.
First of I need to tow it home and it's gonna be only 500 miles and check
to make sure it's safe to be on the road in this thing)
Just my two cents........
