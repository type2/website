If you go back and read the text more carefully, it states
&quot;semaphore turn signals eliminated&quot; - so 1956 US-Spec models
don't have them, so the facts were correct (for this item)
after all.

well, one of the problems in many of these lists of changes, is that while
many of the changes in the buses did NOT happen at the switch of a model year
or calender year, people want it to be a nice tidy package, and will lump
things around to create that.  While it may look tidy, it remains that
semaphores were not dropped for the 56 N Am spec model year, but partway
through the 55 model year.

Why did the buses drop the 36hp motor and the splitcase transmission part way
through may of 59?   seems just random, has noting to do with model years.
Not tidy for looking back at a list.  They just designed a new way of doing
it, a better way (well the new motor was a mistake, but the tunnel case tranny
does have advantages) and went for that.

The english VW bus book has inaccuracies in its lists of changes, and so does
the NEATO/BK/SSVC spec guide.   While all are great for a general idea of
changes, people with buses near the change VIN would probably be confused,
finding the list saying one thing and there bus saying another.

I pretty much consider 55 barndoors to be 54s for parts purposes in my little
mental world, and sort of the bus model year change to be the end of
barndoors.    Less confusing as a lot of shop list parts as 55- to whatever,
and if you say you have a 55, they treat it as a post barndoor so it is easier
to call it a 54 in those cases.     They made a huge change  at that time.
