&gt;All, these are the predicted split results from yesterdays poll as to what
ATDC is.&lt;

It is on the left of the 0 degree mark (straight up).  I agree that it is
not logical as the engine spins clockwise.  I was confused at first as
well.  Look in your idiot manual, it is stated there.  BTDC is on the right
of center (clockwise).  Other folks can state why it is worded backwards to
what you would think as it still doesnt make sense to me.

The timing light thread is leaving me with a headache.  Why would someone
spend an hour making a timing light when you can get one at your FLAPS
for....like a dollar fifty or something.  I just use a cheap, good old 12v
tester light.
