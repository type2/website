&gt; E &amp;B,
&gt; I haven't had that experience yet, and believe me, I have dynamited my
&gt; brakes often enough with all these crazy drivers. I have read several
&gt; posts to this effect, but has it actually happened to someone, or is it
&gt; just supposition?
&gt; 

 I have a similar set up late bay brakes all round and a servo mastercylinder 
with no servo. And have had no problems. Any hoo a freind is fitting porsche 
brakes and wants to know what the bentley bible says about the angle of the 
pressure regulating valve. TIA Mike
