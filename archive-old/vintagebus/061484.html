I'm about to reinstall the Westy interior in my 66 van but I'm wondering about
a few things. #1) Is there a plywood floor in the dining area between the rear
seat and front seats. If so how thick was it?

Yes.  Check the archives or page Jim Ellis here on the list.  He just
did a good write up of installing the sub floor and the door edging trim &lt;snip&gt;
Don't forget the threaded ring/collar that gets screwed to the floor for the
table leg to mount in.

------------------------|
Primarily I have been laying back due to personal schedule and taking heat from
the distractors.

Secondly, regarding the ring/collar piece: I waited to install this piece until
AFTER the main deck table was mounted on the wall. That way I was able to mark
the exact spot at which to drill the hole by swinging the table leg down. The
ring/collar piece is a flat metal disk with three small holes near the outer
edge 120 degrees apart from each other. A larger hole in the center of the flat
disk is large enough to accept the single pole-like table leg. This larger hole
has a slight cut at one point with the metal bent to create a &quot;thread&quot; for the
leg-pole. The set-up is simple. The disk (for the 66-67) should be painted the
same chocolate milk brown/warmgrey as the mechanisms of the Z-bed and painted
hubcaps. Expect the paint to be scuffed and removed with normal usage.
