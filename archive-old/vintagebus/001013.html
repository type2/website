Hey Volks

I occasionally see listees searching for original glass, usually Sigla or
Sekurit brands. I have wondered if VW used whatever glass was available or
if certain glass was used on certain models/years.

I have also noticed that VW used other glass manufacturers. The pop-out side
window glass on my Dormobile is by Durvit, and the laminated and frosted
pop-outs on my 67 ambulance are by Delog. South African buses feature
locally made Armourfloat brand safety glass (side windows and early
windscreens) and Safevue brand laminated (later and replacement
windscreens).

My 1965 factory &quot;Damage Numbers&quot; book lists the following glass suppliers:
Delog, Durvit, Duro, Kinon, Sekurit, Sigla.

Anyone seen more obscure glass like Kinon? Anyone have any ideas about VW
&quot;glass rules&quot;?

Is this exciting or what? ;-)
