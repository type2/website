Subject: Brake drum question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.3.96.1000729172552.32378A-100000_at_pdx444.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;


Recently I inspected my rear brakes, and realized my drums were completely
thrashed. So I bought some new drums from BFY. Now I'm trying to put my
new drums on, and they don't fit.  They seem very close to fitting, but
won't slide over the axle. 

The original part no. is: 211 501 61?
The new part: Mex. 2591

Is this the correct replacement drum? If not, what is the correct
replacement. If so, does anyone have any idea how to make these fit?
