Hi Clara,
Right and the fogging is caused from water getting into past the seal and
attacking the plastic laminate between the two layers of glass.  Thusly the
reason that old safety glass will have the white fogging in it on the bottom
of the glass where the water collects due to gravity.  Eric&amp;Barb
