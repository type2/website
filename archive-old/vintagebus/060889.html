Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?


I mean no disrespect to Lind, but I doubt that the
powdercoating is to blame. I am just glad that neither
was hurt too bad.
I run powdercoated 15&quot; rims on my Westy (since 1997)
and I have never had a problem with the lugs working
loose. If that was true it would seem to me that my
engine tin would get loose and come aprt as well. It
never has. Just my 2 cents .
