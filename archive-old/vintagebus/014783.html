Question 2 about the outlet diameter (Read Clara's message, attached)

When did the outlet diameter change? Right when they went to fresh air? Or
when they improved the J-tube with fins?

   A bug one could be used in a 68- 71 bus, but the heater cables would not
line

   up, so you could not turn the heat on/off from inside the bus, though you 
   could wire it open. The bug ones and the splitty bus ones are the same. As

   E&amp;B said, the earlier VWs, about 64 or 63 and earlier, have smaller heat 
   ducts in the vehicle, 60mm instead of 80mm i think it is, and the heater 
   boxes are corresponding in diameter ewhere the heat goes out, though that
can

   be dealt with. 

   the bottom line is with a splitty with a 1600 motor you can use the bug 
   heater boxes that are common.

   It's the bay windoiw bus ones that are different, but that is just where
the 
   heat cable goes. I have seen the bug ones in bay buses, usually cause 
   someone had pulled a motor from a bug and put it in a bus.
