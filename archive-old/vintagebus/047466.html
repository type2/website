Hi Isaiah,
We have heard that the best of the adjustable push rod tubes are the type 
made of aluminum and threaded into place.  Though any of these type of tubes 
are just good as a quick fix.  The stock thin walled push rod tubes actually 
help by cooling the oil flowing from the hot head to the engine case.  With 
the adjustable factor of the aftermarket tubes the double wall of the 
telescoping action of them insulates part of the tube/s and plastic just 
insulates more due to less coductivity.   Eric&amp;Barb
