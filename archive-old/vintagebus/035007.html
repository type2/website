&lt;&lt; Hi,
  Well, I did pull them out, did you read my proceedure?  Threading a bolt in 
the top and then driving them out from the bottom effectively pulls them out. 
 I can certainly imagine that pressing or pounding from the wrong end would 
be counterproductive for the very reasons you mention.    Eyes Open,    -Dyer 
&gt;&gt;
Hi Dyer,
Whoops!  Thanks for the clarafication.  We must have read it a little too 
fast!
