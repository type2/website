&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What are the correct bolts to hold the belly splash pan in place?  The
&gt;&gt;parts book says they are self tapping hex bolts but I pulled a few from
&gt;&gt;a 62 and they were machine thread hex bolts.
&gt;
&gt;there are some of each- the machine thread ones are the same thread as 
&gt;the engine tin screws but use the ones with the 10mm hex head for ease
&gt;of removal.

FWIW, I agree with Claralw on this one.  My '64 has some of each on
its belly pan.  It seems like they used the self-tapping ones in
&quot;blind&quot; holes (like into the frame rail) and machine ones in holes
that they could get a speed-nut on...I think there are speed-nuts
or some kind of attached, threaded nut on some of the holes on mine.
