Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I wonder if you could insulate the inside panels of
&gt; your doors/ body panels this way. Has anyone tried
&gt; this?  Would it be a smart way to keep water from
&gt; ruining the bottom inside of your cab doors?
&gt;
I did this to my bus, sprayed it behind all the door panels in the bus and
found no noticable change in sound. If you can clean every bit of rust from
all the inside crevises of the door, it would work well to keep the rust
away, but the only way I see that really possible with good results would be
sandblasting, or potent rust converter.

You could POR-15 the insides of the doors to stop rust from forming, and
stop the current rust from going anywhere with excellent results though.
POR-15 will convert rust and is extremely durable.

Last fall I insulated behind all my panels with the pink fiberglass
insulation from Home Depot which made a HUGE difference in sound proofing,
as well as giving my doors a &quot;whump&quot; noise when they close from the original
&quot;clang&quot; noise they previously were. If you put in insulation like that, it
is important that you do not compress the insulation, as it works best that
way (you have to peel away layers of insulation to get it the correct
thickness, one roll ends up being enough for an entire bus unless you're
doing the roof as well), and make sure you install a vapor barier (plastic
sheet) to keep condensation from rotting your bus away as the insulation can
cause this. I can talk to the wife while going down the freeway at 4000rpm
without having to yell now. Last thing I need to do is find a good way to
insulate the engine bay from the passenger compartment with something thin
enough that a carpet kit will lay over it without looking ganky.
