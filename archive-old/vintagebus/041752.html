Well heck, if you're aiming to impress your friends with your conspicuous
spending of money, shoehorn in a Lycoming O-720.  It's a pushrod flat-8 
engine, but with 400 horsepower on tap and a flat powerband it'll 
definitly move a bus.

You might want a freeway flyer transmission, since redline is 2700RPM

Figure about 35K for a nicely rebuilt engine. :)
