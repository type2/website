  There is someone on the type 2 list that wrote his paper using the people
and their personalities of the type 2 list for his masters degree. I don't
remember who it was, but it was recent

As a master's level psychologist working with the severe mentally ill, I
couldn't agree more.  I have filed a new disorder in our bible, the DSM-V,
called Davidmayes Hyperactivity Disorder, it is a combination of Freud's
Anal Retentive disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Oppositional
Definant Disorder.

There you go from the horse's mouth.

&gt; i can assure you that 'anal-retentive' is the FIRST thing out of a
&gt; shrink's mouth for this list... followed by 'obsessive-compulsive.'
