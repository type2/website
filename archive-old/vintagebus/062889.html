Subject: [VB] Bus Stickers



Years ago (5) there was this great black square sticker with white type
which read &quot;Never Get Behind A VW Bus.&quot; I loved that one. It was on my
previous splittie, &quot;Alias,&quot; which after 19 years was pretty much vaporized
by a red-lighter.

That was 1997. The splittie I drive these days, &quot;Grief,&quot; with tremendous
thanks to this list over the years, after five years of coaxing the shy
thing it's finally morphing into the operational reliability that was Alias'
and, along with a new paint scheme, I'm trying to find a respectable sticker
with which to christen its (stubbornly reluctant) coming of age.

Alas, &quot;Never Get Behind A VW Bus&quot; is now nowhere to be found. I've tried old
links but they're all dead. Even Google got me zilch. &quot;Funkengroovin',&quot; the
store from which I ordered the original for Alias, seems to have
disappeared.

And now I've a VW Bus ex-basketcase, once headed for Bus Heaven and now a
daily driver, in need of a little chutzpah. Or moxie.

Has anyone here seen this sticker or know if it's still available somewhere?

Thanks.

Craig
