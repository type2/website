Subject: bus sighting... WalMart

&quot;Hip&quot; TV commercial with young girls talking in a diner about togetherness or 
something. They cavort around and in a sunroof deluxe, blue/white? They then 
buy clothes and feel so good about everything they forget about the sweatshops 
where the clothes are made.
