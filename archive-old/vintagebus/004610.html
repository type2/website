Sounds like the guy is doing the bidding himself. I just got a p-mail
warning me about this auction. Someone said in that mail massage that he was
the high bidder but the owner refused to follow through or something.
weird,

just like the one I bought my bus from. Decided to not sell it to me after
someone told him he can get more for it even though I sent him a deposit.


Andre

&gt; OK, why when it didn't sell the first time, why didn't the second highest
&gt; bidder take the auction? I thought that was they it worked. And I looked
and
&gt; saw that sonicvw and jonny5111 are bidders on almost every one of his 5
&gt; auctions and almost all the high bidders have low feedback profiles. I
smell
&gt; a snake.
