Subject: Re: more tents, and poles THOM
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm working on having a Westy tent reproduced by Dawn at PLF. If she ever 
finishes the tent that is. I'm expecting great results for the length of time 
it has taken.She is doing the sewing and my team engineers is waiting for a 
set of poles to reproduce. Which reminds me. Anyone willing to loan a set of 
poles for a fews weeks, we will cover the cost of shipping and insurance. 
Once one set is made we will be equipped to reproduce more and we know there 
are many of you out there that need poles.  Thanks.
