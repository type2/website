&gt; Is there anything else that we should be doing to preserve Willie over the 
&gt; winter e.g. should we start him on a regular basis, put a trickle charger on 
&gt; the battery, put oil in the cylinder heads, etc?

Hi Rodger&amp;Patricia,
Make sure to leave several of the windows cracked open to prevent moisture 
from building up and molding the interior.  Good idea to change oil and start 
the engine at least once a month to run for at least fifteen minutes at a time.  
Any less run time loads the muffler with moisture from burning gasolene and 
rusts out the muffler much faster.  After six months or when you pull it out of 
storage whichever comes first change the oil again.  When you pull it out of 
storage check your logbook for other preventive maintenance items like flex 
fuel line and complete brake fluid replacement every three years to keep your VW 
from BBQing or crashing.
