Subject: Re: [VB] fan width

hmm... there are other reasons than fan width why the engine could be running 
hot.

fan belt loose?
timing set right?
all cooling tin in place?
how hot was the day?   how fast were you driving?
old gas?
engine covered with crud? (a cleaner engine runs cooler)

but as long as the engine's out... install new fuel line between tank and 
engine, and if the axle boots are torn replace them too.
how are the seals between the ends and center of the intake mainfold?
