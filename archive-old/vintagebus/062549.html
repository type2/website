&gt; I was driving my bus home last night when the engine quit (1600 DP

&gt; distributor.  I went home and grabbed a spare coil, drove back to the 
&gt; scene of the crime and installed it.  Started right up.
&gt; I've never had a coil fail before.  Is this common or could something 
&gt; else have caused the coil to fail?
