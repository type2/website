Subject: Re: [VB] Need sheet metal for '65

Why not mig it up?  That's worked for me lots of times.  You can use a chunk
of copper plate to support the weld from the backside until it's sel-fsupporting.

&gt; The English cargo floors seem to be unavailable through the usual channels, so if anyone has a set they don't need, let me know.

&gt; The '66 Riviera is rolling on new front bearings and stopping with new brake shoes and cyls. They were competely gunked up with fluid and dust, the drums had rust pits because the shoes weren't hitting 'em. Guess that's better than grooves. It's a miracle that the nose is unhit, but may explain the fallover damage at the roofline and drivers door.  Next step is some hole and pit filling in the lower windshield channel. A neighbor mentioned lead as a filler. Anybody use this? I was going to use the thick POR15 from the tube.
