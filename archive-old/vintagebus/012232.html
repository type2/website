&gt;  Despite the badmouthing Type2's get from Click and Clack, the Tappet
&gt; Brothers on Car Talk, their puzzler section has a few references to&gt;
our
&gt; favorite vehicle. Check out the archives. Good reading too.&gt;
&gt;  Here's a puzzler from a few years ago.... What mechanism can be&gt;
removed
&gt; from nearly any automobile or truck and installed on another vehicle
&gt; without modification and function perfectly?  Not a fluid or&gt;
electrical,
&gt; strictly mechanical.&gt;&gt;   


My vote goes to ......
Valve stem inserts. There are many different style valve stems for
trucks and passenger tires, but, all of the valve inserts are the same.
Any others?
