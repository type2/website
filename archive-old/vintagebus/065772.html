Subject: 23 Window update

Well,

Bryan pulled the bus out of the garage yesterday and YIKES, it needs some 
help.  Rather than belabor the point, I just stuck it on ebay for him with 
a lower starting point and no reserve.  If you are interested, search under 
seller KN6F.

Between him working, going to school and keeping up with his other 
responsibilities, there hasn't been much time left to work on this 
project.  I had seriously thought he had made more progress.  Oh well....

So, if anyone is looking for a 23 window PROJECT, you've just been informed.

A direct link to my web page is at
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/ebay/23win.html
This is not the actual ebay listing, but where the info comes from.

Yes I know its rough, but comments are still welcome.
