I guess I'll have to save that piece off of all the bay windows I junk out.
Never saved that piece and don't know how many I've thrown away.

who needed this?  Ellis?  but you're driving the 63 aren't you?  i like 
driving a ratty bus, myself, rather than the shiny version.  Anyway,   I 
think I do have one or two- would have to check------&gt;&gt;



Clara,

Its me, the double cab from the KP and Santa Cruz camp out. :-)
