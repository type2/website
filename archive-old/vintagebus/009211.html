Subject: [VB] Needle/Seat assembly for 34PICT3

Greetings:

Had another new needle/seat assembly start leaking on a 34PICT3 today
resulting in flooding on shutdown and restart.  Put my good old one back in
and cured problem.

Out of curiosity I weighed both of floats, one weighed 9 grams and one
10.5-11 grams.  Put the lightest one back in with the old needle/seat and
everything working fine again.

Is there a source of needle/seat assemblies of reputable quality? I can't
find one other than the complete rebuild kits.  Has anyone else had problems
like this?  A couple of guys told me when I first had this problem with the
other carb a week ago they had.

Thanks for the info.
