One advantage of running a web-based parts swap is that every once in
a while, a really rare/odd thing comes by.  Today's example:

================================================================
&lt;h3&gt;Have&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part: Left side slidingdoor for Split
&lt;li&gt;Year: 1967
&lt;li&gt;Location: The Netherlands
&lt;li&gt;Description:
Very rare part:  Left-side sliding door for Splitscreen bus.
================================================================

I don't believe I've ever seen one of these, although I have heard of
the right-hand version....
