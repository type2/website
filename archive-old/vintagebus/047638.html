Well if you can do only 52 MPH with a 40 horse what can I expect in my 56
kombi with the original 36 horse...also factor in the reduction boxes... I was
thinking about driving it to the Classic come summer and that is a 12 hour
drive in an other car. I personally have never driven a 36 horse, but my 40
horse in my 65 bug is a daily driver and I can crack 75 MPH with that ...that
is a bug not a bus..BIG difference.

it's not that the top possible speed is 52mph, it's that where it felt most
comfortable- the sweet spot.  This goes back to the rpm discussion, and that
the crising speed really is related to the gearing.  If  this 52mph was
without the little nut reduction gear boxes (ie bug) I would be going 52x1.39
= ~72mph at the same engine rpms.  I don't know what the gearing is inside,
but it just aint no freeway flier.   Also, the bug has less weight to haul,
and so one with a 40hp is much perkier than a splitty with a 40hp.   Think
the splitty weighs about 1000 pounds more.   But the low gearing is good for
what I plan to generally use it for.    The motor size says how much
(horse)power you have at any speed or rpm, but if the truck is geared 3,000
rpms at about 50 in 4th, that is with whatever motor might go in there.

If your 56 kombi has the original tranny as well as engine, you are geared
with the top speed about a whopping 50 mph.   You could push it faster, but
then you are pushing it. - Look at the speedo- see that red mark there?
that's the red line.   My truck was originally equiped with a split case
tranny and a 36hp motor and the 70 mph speedo, same as a 56, and the redline
at the higher speed is about 50 mph, where is feels best, even with a
completely piecemeal retrofitted later drivetrain (68-69 front axle, late
59-63? tunnel case transaxle, 61 bug engine).

For a long drive in a slow bus, particularly with small unusual lighting, I
would caravan, with the last car the one with the biggest, brightest lights.
Or mount extra taillights/brake lights for the drive- magnetic like ones, or
bolt into the bumper bolts.     If I take my barndoor up to seattle, I always
have someone behind me, then again I'm just cautious, but I realise people are
not expecting a 50mph bus with tiny taillights and one center brake light.
This is an antique vehicle, and I have seen only a handful of brakelight
decklid buses driving around.   Mine came with a orange brake light (Dutch
spec), but I use a red one, as a 6V bulb is hard to see through a yellowy
orange lens in day time.   Neither does it fits other drivers' search image of
a brake light.   The 58-61 style taillights on my truck are brighter.  12
hours is a long drive.   Then again I drove the 59 I used to have all over the
country and back, and didn't worry.
