Over my lunch hour today, I was watching TV and about choked on my hamburger
when I saw a commercial for the new Compaq Presario.  Featured is a splitty
bus (white over red) with corner glass and a 5 lugger rim on the front.  As
the commercial goes back and forth between features of the Presario and the
bus, it kind of carries a story line about how this guy uses the net to
figure out how to fix his bus.  Actually, on part shows him typing something
like &quot;...how to fix my bus...&quot;
The wiper blade comes off in his hand in one skit and the last one shows the
kids and the dad trying to push the bus in the snow while the mom says (with
a big smile on her face), &quot;I think we need a new car.&quot;

There is also some cool wire frame graphics of a bus and a white over blue
one that is shown on the computer screen in a futuristic version of the web.

Anyone else see this _COOL_ commercial?
