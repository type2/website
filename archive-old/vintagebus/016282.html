Met a guy named Evan way back when who developed and
marketed &quot;glo-in-the-dark&quot; stick on stars and planets.
Everyone thought that he spent more time eating acid
than going to Temple like the good Jew that his muthah
wished he was.
We all thought Evan was whacked. He now lives in a
plush house in a very upscale area of Phoenix metro
area. Success due to fifteen years of marketing one
&quot;stupid&quot; idea.
Good thinking. Now apply the concept to Chevy, ford,
hotrod, oldschool station wagons, NASCAR, NHRA,
Harleys etc etc. Send me 20% commission of the first
million or 3% of the live long gross profit.
