&lt;&lt; is your 2110 on a later (type IV) or earlier (upright) style case?
 
 ya, think your question is a bit vague,   myself I like to keep it simple 
(1600sp), and that way it's more reliable.   So maybe I don't have much to 
offer you for advice, anyway &gt;&gt;

yea its a upright 1600 case as-41 bored and stroked to  2110
im usually quite happy with a 1600 or maybe 1649 but this just sort of fell 
in my lap and i was wondering how to make the best of it and use it in the DC.
I was looking thru my carb stash and i have a set of brosals and a set of 
kadrons
and was wondering if these are suficient for this motor?
i also have a set of 44mm ida's         would these be better suited to the 
motor?
for the ignition i'll probably go with a Jacobs pointless system.
