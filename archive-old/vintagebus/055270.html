Subject: Re: [VB] Original?

Actually, it was Hot VW's. They just covered the
event. The award was given at a large VW show in LA!

&gt; &gt; I was just thumbing through one of the new VW rags
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; stumbled upon an article that left me with a
&gt; &gt; question.
&gt; &gt; What would the definition be for an &quot;original
&gt; bus&quot;.
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; would assume that an original bus would be
&gt; &gt; unrestored.
&gt; &gt; That means cleaned up and displayed. It doesn't
&gt; seem
&gt; &gt; right to have had the vehicle painted,
&gt; &gt; re-upolstered,
&gt; &gt; accessories added and then displayed as original.
&gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; bus in question is a VERY nice bus but as far as i
&gt; &gt; am
&gt; &gt; concerned NOT original. Stock yes, original no. Am
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; off here?
