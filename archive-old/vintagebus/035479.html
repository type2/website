&lt;&lt;Could someone tell me what thread pitch the standard 14 mm lug bolts are?&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Yes we can, but first some info to keep you from crashing your bus.  Thread 
fit comes in three classes.  Class A means the parts have to be threaded 
together with a wrench.  Class B means one can thread them together by hand.  
Class C means they can be threaded not only by hand, but spun on freely.
  Lug bolts are fitted with a Class B fit or slightly tighter.  If you get a 
Class C fit these bolts will easily work thier way out and off goes a wheel!  
So what you need to do is either grind a cleaning notch in a lug bolt like 
most of the engine sheetmetal screws have or buy the proper sized tap that 
will clean out a threaded hole in the drum, but not cut it any BIGGER.
  Taps not only come in diameter and threads per inch, but also in fit size.  
2H will be two sizes bigger than nominal size, while 2L will be two sizes 
smaller than nominal.  You want either a nominal size or smaller.  Even after 
you get the tap make sure to test it on a bad drum to see that it cleans out 
the hole without cutting any new steel chips out of it and then test this 
hole for a Class B or tighter fit with a lug bolt that has been freshly wire 
brushed clean.
Tap size for buses is 14x1.50mm  Eric&amp;Barb
