  Don't take this the wrong way, but you need &quot;The Idiot's Guide&quot; in a bad way! Read it and you will understand your busses workings much better.  
  VW's in general and busses in particular frustrate newbie owners when they breakdown due to accumulated abuses such as poor maintenance. These owners then discard the vehicle and perpetuate the stereotype that busses are undependable.
  By educating yourself (which you have begun to do by reading this list) mechanics will no longer be able to take advantage of you, and you will learn enough to fix and maintain your vehicle before its deaththrows drive you to selling it and badmouthing the mark.
  BTW- I do give you credit for getting grease under your nails. Get a nail brush and some dishsoap for that.

IMHO, YMMV

I tried and couldn't get the drag link off .. My boyfriend was at work and I 
don't know any of my neighbors really .. anyway .. they are ALL older than 
me .. Wouldn't think of asking them to crawl under my bus .. Do I get credit 
for trying ? Do I get credit for the stuff that I will NEVER get out from 
under my fingernails ??
