 &gt; Hi Benj,
 &gt; Only if the truck was a pre-1959 model.   Eric&amp;Barb
 
 My DCab built december '59 has an ordinary bus bumper which needed to have
 the inside corners cut in a bit to accomadate the square profile of the rear
 three quarter panels. This post reminded me of the swearing I did when I
 tried to fit the newly straightened and sprayed bumper the night before
 setting off on an epic journey.
 
 Had got the bumper from a friend and hadn't thought of fitting it up.
  &gt;&gt;
I had a early 59 truck for a while (sold it almost a year ago).

It had no back bumper when I got it, nor running motor (the motor that came 
with had a 4 part cam shaft)

I had a nice back bumper I put on my 65 westy, and took the bumper off the 65 
westy, which I had purchased slightly dented with peas shooter cut outs at a 
junkyard for $15.  came off a 65 standard.

I spray painted the pea shooter bumper white, and slpped it on the 59 truck, 
which had been reconverted to 6V witha 40hp 6V bug motor (peashooters) 
installed.

maybe not so stock, but much more functional.   I wanted it to run, and have 
a bumper.   Had plans to re fit a split case tranny and tidy more up on it, 
when I was made an offer I couldn't refuse, and Truck left me sadder, but 
more solvent.

Anyway, the bumper fit w/o modifications.
