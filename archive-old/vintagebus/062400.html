Subject: [VB] AS type Engine does not start, although ignition, and
carburation are fine



At the end, engine simply does not want to start, although if I put gasoline

straight in cylinder...
If anyone has an idea of what is wrong...I would appreciate some help on 
that one.

Sounds like a typical carb rebuild to me. Anything from crystallized gunk in
the air and fuel tubes to dried out broken diaphragm or stuck float. All of
my carbs that are going to be shelved get sprayed down on the inside with
LPS lubricant to keep the aluminum corrosion in check and any residual fuel
chemicals from starting any. My shelved engines get a rag down the intake
throat and the carb on the shelf. Any long term engines either get the
points removed or a piece of paper between the contacts so they don't
corrode together.
