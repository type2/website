Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch thump

I've been having this same problem for the last three years, and it drives
my crazy. It seems that the tranny system is overly sensitive to the
engine speed. Previous trannies and my 64 bus never had this problem, just
this last tranny that I've had in here for the last 3 or 4 years. I've
never had such sensitivity to engine speed matching. It's uncomfortable,
and screws up 30 years of driving experience. I'm not a sloppy shifter,
but none of my other units ever was this picky.

Does anyone know why this is happening? Is it bad synchros or problem in
the slider assemblies?

&gt; HI JT,
&gt; Sounds like you are not getting the RPMs between the engine and the
&gt; transmission just right.  When this thump occurs does the bus surge in a decellerating
&gt; or accellerating way?  It does take quite some practice to get the correct gas
