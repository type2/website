Today I was shown the true spirit of the list by someone's kindness. I am a
relative nobody on  this list. I haven't been into type 2's very long and
only a list member for about a year. That didn't matter though. About 2
weeks ago I posted a question about my front wheel bearings for my 65 DC. I
got a lot of great responses and even some off list help(thanks Clara!). One
of the suggestions was to replace the 2 locknuts with one of the late model
bus locking nuts. Karl asked me my address and yesterday I got 2 late model
locking nuts. He never asked for money. Just helped out a fellow VW guy. To
me, this is what the list is all about. Thanks Karl!! You made my day!

ps  Karl, I'm sending money even though you didn't ask!

TJ
