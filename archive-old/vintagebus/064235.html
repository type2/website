Subject: new bus, naming it

Hi All,

Although on a low profile, I'm heading up tomorrow (Friday) to pick up a new
bus... it's been a low profile so far since the deal really wasn't supposed
to go down until the end of next year but here I am.  And then I decided to
give it to my wife for her birthday coming up in a few weeks (hey, my
grandpa used to give my grandma shotguns and lawnmowers, I'm just keeping
the family tradition alive :-) ).  She still doesn't know about it :-O

Anyway, I have a few thoughts for the plates already but I thought I would
canvas the list to get a few more ideas.

Oregon limits you to 6 characters.

So far I've been contemplating:

'UPUPVW'
'GOUPVW'
'UPGOVW'
'8M VW'
'TALLVW'
'HIGHVW'
'VWBCKT'



Other thoughts include
'UPUGO'  but I wanted to keep 'VW' in the text


oh... http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/64SO9.htm


If you want to see it, watch near the port of tacoma road after 1pm (most
likely) or on Hwy 18 sometime in the afternoon.  Just look for an orange
single cab with a blue light on top.



David
