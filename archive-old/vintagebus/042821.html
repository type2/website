Subject: The safari/leakage situation

Splitters, 

 I am determined to help find a solution to the safari leakage situation
-- besides removal and replacement with stock stationary glass.  I just
can't be satisfied with &quot;they all leak.&quot;  There must be a solution.

  I've got re-po safari's and have tried two different rubber seals and
they both leak, mainly on the passenger side with the water stream coming
down the opening on the drain lip on the roof, and depositing on the
safari frame and rubber seal, running between the seal and the safari
frame and flowing onto the dash, with rain water falling onto the parcel
tray and cascading onto the floor.

  Perhaps the tab brackets screwed into the dash are off by 1/64&quot;, the
drivers side leaks only a small amount, I think it will be easier to bend
the tab, then to drill another hole, and I'll try that first. It would be
nice if I had moveable brackets like I heard the originals came with. But
if that does not work...I propose this solution.

  Since I know there have been many people who said they can get rubber
moldings made up before.  I don't know if I read it on the list or dreamed
it, but having a flap seal that is held on the inside on the safari frame
on the inside of the glass (the cab side) of the safari should form a
u-channel when closed against the frame seal to keep water out.  This flap
would be about the thickness of the overhead vent flap and half the size
(I'm talking about the one that is sandwiched and riveted together.)  This
rubber could replace the existing rubber in-between the glass and safari
frame and be held in place by the glass.  It would have to be formed so
that the sliding arms would be taken into consideration.  I think this
would help seal so no water would get in.  But, the problem now would be
that there is too much rubber (as per thickness) to fit in the window
frame area, so the other seal would have to be redesigned.   In the
redesigning of the window frame seal, a small lip that could hold the
safari frame lip seal flap could be made so you could tuck the safari
frame seal in with one of those white plastic knives RMMW sells.  I think
this would stop the leakage and the tell-tale damage you see on many buses
on the dash, parcel tray and floor.

Best,
