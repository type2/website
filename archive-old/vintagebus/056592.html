Subject: Re: [VB] My bus, my reply

I can appreciate both points of view and they really aren't that far apart!
I helped Dan cut the roof off the bus that ended up on John's DD Panel
Barndoor ?? window sunroof.  That bus was a done deal.  I posted the
pictures a couple of years ago but the bus had sat in a field under a tree
for who knows how long and the canvas had disintegrated long ago so all the
seasons had deposited in there for years!!  The bulkhead was rusted to foil
a good 6 inches above the floor!  When we cut the roof off the bus just
folded to the ground.  There were a few other trinkets like latches and such
but the bus itself was just gone.  From what I have heard the Barndoor SC
was pretty bad also!  Don't know about the panel!  My point here is that
John took a few busses that were bad or gone and made a $20-$30K bus that I
do appreciate.  Personally I like stock and I think most of you here do also
but when someone has the talent and creativity to do what John did deserves
kudos. Hopefully Street Rodders won't be the only ones that can be looked up
to for doing custom!  I loved the stuff that KCW did with that bus and was
very thought provoking.  But I also have to wonder about the depreciation of
a wild custom.  Look at the Batman car market!!   And like John said it is a
money losing proposition for him but it is also his ride.  And probably
somewhat of a write-off? for his business.  If I had $20K sitting here we
would be having drinks right now toasting the new owner of your bus!  But I
would drive it!  At least on cloudless sunny Sundays!

Subject: [VB] My bus, my reply


&gt; I always miss out on all the fun!!  You guys must all have computers and
&gt; internet at work.. The threads are usually over by the time I get home
from
&gt; work.  But I guess I will reply since Mike (turkisbus)said yesterday that
I
&gt; never reply.
&gt;
&gt; Tom is sooo right...  I will not make a dime off my bus.  I will be honest
&gt; with all of you, I have $25K in parts and materials, and about 2500 hours
in
&gt; it.  Rust repair takes awhile, so does all that Kustom stuff!!  If all I
did
&gt; was stock stuff, I could slam them out!!  There's nothing to figure out..
&gt; Some rust repair, paint and body, refurb all the original stuff, put it
back
&gt; together.   My bus is basically a win/lose deal. Good promotional tool,
lose
&gt; money when I sell!  But as Tom pointed out, it was a tool to promote our
&gt; shop, show our work, and get our name out in a hurry.  It worked, Heck you
&gt; guys talk about me and my bus all the time!!  And the work we are doing
now,
&gt; is atleast twice as nice as my bus!!  Come on by and check it out..
&gt;
&gt; Another point you guys will more than likely find interesting.  My Oval,
on
&gt; the Sept 97 cover of HOtV's, I had $12,500 in parts and materials,
probably
&gt; 1000 hours, sold it for $9500.  My single cab, March 99 Hot V's, also
&gt; VolksWorld, also in a book, had $13,500 in receipts, another 1000 hours or
&gt; so,  sold for $13,250.  Building VW's is not really a money making
buisness.
&gt; Especially if you build to show winning/magazine quality without taking
any
&gt; short cuts, and buying all new parts all the time.  Could you imagine if I
&gt; PAID someone else to do all that work?  Lets see, 1000 hours x 40 an
hour..
&gt; WOW..  Tom, how much profit did you get out of your unfinished Barndoor?
My
&gt; bus will more than likely be the LAST killer VW I build for myself.  I
always
&gt; build every car I ever build with a purpose, to be the nicest one of it's
&gt; kind out, period.  You can't do that on a shoe string budget.  You all
should
&gt; know this by now.  How many of you profited when you sold a VW?  An
&gt; unrestored car is easy to make money on, I only want to hear about &quot;nice&quot;
&gt; stuff that you sold, restored, refurbished or whatever.
&gt;
&gt; Hideous??  Matter of opinion I think..  Hard to believe Tom would say that
&gt; &quot;outloud&quot;.  I would never bash ANYONE's bus to their face, or in public!!
&gt; Somethings are better left not said.. Know what I mean??        And I look
at
&gt; back issues all the time!!  trends always come back around, and you always
&gt; want to carry everything one step further than the last guy did.  If his
bus
&gt; was low, then you gotta go lower!!!  If he had a 2007cc, you gotta build a
&gt; 2110!  You get it.. Thats how you get in magazines, thats how you win
shows.
&gt; Yes Tom, it's creativity.  Like many have said before.. I can only look at
so
&gt; many sealing wax red buses before I feel as if I have seen them all.  A
stock
&gt; resto is sooo easy.  All you gotta do is do the work, you already know the
&gt; entire project's layout.. Rendering.. Just get a dealer brochure.. There
it
&gt; is!!  Tom your bus is a Kustom.. How many Chrome Yellow buses were built?
&gt;
&gt; I Truley appreciate the compliment on the workmanship.  Thanks a ton.  And
I
&gt; know what you were saying, and for the most part you are not bashing me or
my
&gt; bus, just stating your taste.  And you are kinda right about shelf life.
But
&gt; I think NO car should be shown more than one or two years.  Once everyone
has
&gt; seen it, it's old news, it's time to build another, it's time to go to the
&gt; next level,  which is what I do..  I have never shown a car for more than
one
&gt; season.  I sell it, and build another.  I am willing to bet I will have
&gt; hundreds of resto's under my belt before I die.. And love everyone of
them..
&gt; I like to build killer cars! Not collect them.   Once I finish them, they
are
&gt; old news to me, the fight is over.. I usually don't even drive them after
a
&gt; few months!  So I sell them and build another, building cars, my true
love!
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Streetrods are my future.  And I am fitting right in with those guys.  I
plan
&gt; to start mine right after I sell my bus!  Someone will get a heck of a bus
&gt; for $20K...
&gt;
&gt; Take care, sleep good, and I can't wait to read all the stuff tommorow
night!!
&gt; John Jones
&gt; Bus driver, soon to be full time street rodder.
