&gt; The hunt for relays was hard and easy...

&gt; If you need 50 amps there is a 944 relay (for the ignition switch) that can
&gt; handle it with larger connectors (1/2&quot;? as opposed to the standard 1/4&quot;).  I
&gt; doubt anyone needs this, but e-mail me offline and I can supply that PN to
&gt; you.

One thing to check if you are salvaging relays is if the relay is made for
continuous use.  If you use a &quot;momentary&quot; relay for headlights you can
melt the coil.  Momentary relays are used for starter, horn, etc.
